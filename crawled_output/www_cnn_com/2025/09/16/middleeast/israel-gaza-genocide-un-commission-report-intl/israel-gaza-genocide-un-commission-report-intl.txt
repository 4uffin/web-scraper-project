An independent United Nations inquiry has concluded for the first time that Israel has committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza and that the country’s top leaders have incited genocide, in what it described as the “most authoritative UN finding to date.”
In a 72-page report released on Tuesday, the commission, which was set up by the UN Human Rights Council (HRC), found that Israel has “committed four genocidal acts” in the enclave since October 7, 2023, when Hamas carried out deadly attacks on Israel and Israel launched its military campaign.
These acts include the killing of Palestinians in Gaza, causing Palestinians “serious bodily and mental harm,” “deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part,” and “imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group,” according to the report.
Nearly 65,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since October 7, according to the Palestinian health ministry there. The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and fighters but has said that most of the casualties are women and children.
The Israeli government has maintained it is conducting the war in Gaza in self-defense and in accordance with international law, firmly denying accusations of genocide.
“Israel categorically rejects the distorted and false report and calls for the immediate abolition of the Commission of Inquiry,” the country’s foreign ministry said in a statement Tuesday. It described the inquiry as a “report that relies entirely on Hamas falsehoods” and accused the authors of being proxies for the militant group “whose horrific statements about Jews have been condemned worldwide.”
For years, Israel has accused the HRC, which commissioned the report, of having an anti-Israel bias.
The Trump administration has backed Israel, withdrawing from the UN body in 2018 during Trump’s first term and during the first month of the second term. Israel has consistently argued that it is acting in accordance with international law.
But accusations of genocide are growing internationally, including from within the United States.
Last week, US Senators Chris Van Hollen and Jeff Merkley said that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government is “implementing a plan to ethnically clean Gaza of Palestinians” and that the United States is complicit.
Earlier this month, the International Association of Genocide Scholars – the world’s largest body of genocide scholars – said that Israel is committing a genocide in Gaza.
In July, a pair of leading Israeli human rights groups became the first organizations from Israel to make the claim that their country was “committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.”
And in December 2023, South Africa accused Israel of genocide in an unprecedented case at the International Court of Justice, saying the country’s leadership was “intent on destroying the Palestinians in Gaza.”
The UN panel’s report lands as Israel launches a ground incursion into Gaza City after weeks of bombarding the packed urban center despite growing international condemnation. Netanyahu acknowledged the backlash on Monday, saying his country faced “a kind of isolation” that could last for years.
Palestinians ‘targeted collectively’

The report was released by the UN’s Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and Israel.
The commission – an ongoing, independent, international commission of inquiry set up by the UN Human Rights Council in 2021 – is led by Navi Pillay, a former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, former International Criminal Court judge, and former judge and president of the UN International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda.
Pillay and the commission’s other two leaders announced their resignation in July. She said her “age, medical issues and the weight of several other commitments” compelled her to step down in November.
The commission gave several examples of Palestinian civilians, journalists, healthcare professionals and humanitarian workers being “directly targeted and killed” in Gaza. These killings occurred in places including homes, hospitals, schools, and religious buildings, both inside designated safe zones and outside of them, it said.
The report cited the January 2024 killing of 5-year-old Hind Rajab and her family members as an example of Israeli security forces proceeding to kill civilians despite having “clear knowledge of the presence of Palestinian civilians along the evacuation routes and within the safe areas.”
“They shot at and killed civilians, some of whom (including children) were holding makeshift white flags,” the report said. “Some children, including toddlers, were shot in the head by snipers.”

In addition to shooting civilians, Israeli forces have “intentionally killed Palestinian civilians in Gaza by using wide-impact munitions that caused high numbers of deaths,” according to the report.
These munitions were used despite the knowledge that they would kill civilians, the commission said.
“The victims of the bombing were not singled out or targeted as individual civilians. On the contrary, victims were targeted collectively due to their identity as Palestinians,” it said.
Israel has long accused Hamas of using civilians in Gaza as human shields, embedding military infrastructure in civilian areas – allegations Hamas has denied.
‘Weaponized’ withholding of aid
Israel had imposed a yearslong blockade on Gaza before the October 7 attacks, heavily restricting the entry of supplies into the enclave. After the Hamas assault, however, Israel launched a “total siege” of the strip that had a “catastrophic impact on the living conditions of Palestinians in Gaza,” the report said.
“Israel has weaponized the withholding of life-sustaining necessities, specifically by cutting off supplies of water, food, electricity, fuel and other essential supplies, including humanitarian assistance,” the report said.
An already bleak humanitarian situation became even more dire earlier this year, when Israel imposed an 11-week blockade on all aid to Gaza in early March. Shortly after the blockade was lifted in mid-May, a new US- and Israeli-backed group – the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) – took over much of the aid distribution in the territory. Hundreds of Palestinians were subsequently killed while trying to seek aid from sites run by the controversial organization.
In August, a UN-backed panel declared famine in Gaza City and the surrounding areas, saying that more than a half a million people were affected.

Tuesday’s UN report said that Israel’s decision to allow a small amount of aid into Gaza was a “facade” to mislead the international community as it continues to “impose starvation and inhumane living conditions on the Palestinians.”
Netanyahu has repeatedly denied that starvation is taking place in Gaza. In early August, he said, “Israel does not have a policy of starvation. Israel has a policy of preventing starvation.” He said Israel had allowed more than 2 million tons of aid into Gaza since the war began.
GHF said the UN commission report “amplifies falsehoods, rewards bad actors, and undermines the very humanitarian effort it claims to protect.” In a statement, the group said it was the only organization in Gaza able to deliver food “at scale without interference.”
‘Destroyed’ childhood
The report also brought into question Israel’s war aims, saying that “the extensive and deliberate targeting of Palestinian children” is evidence that military operations are not being conducted solely to defeat Hamas, but to “physically destroy the (Palestinian) group by eliminating not only today’s children but the possibility of them having children in (the) future.”
The children of Gaza are suffering both mentally and physically, it said.

“The essence of childhood has been destroyed in Gaza,” one doctor, quoted in the report, said.
Widespread starvation also means that children are “unable to develop speech and meet language milestones” and could be facing potential long-term cognitive issues, it said.
Israel has also refused the entry of formula and special infant milk into Gaza, resulting in the “starvation of new-born and young infants,” the commission said.
This is “especially powerful evidence of an intention to destroy the population,” it said.
‘Sexualized torture’
The report said that Israeli security forces have “perpetrated sexual and gender-based violence” including “rape, sexualized torture and other forms of sexual violence not only as a punishment against the individuals, but as part of a pattern of collective punishment to fracture, humiliate and subjugate the Palestinian population in its entirety.”
“This is evident through the Israeli soldiers’ social media content where they blatantly showed themselves committing acts to dehumanize Palestinians,” the commission said.
The report said it heard from many Palestinians who said they were subjected to sexual and gender-based violence while in detention, including testimony from one detainee, who said that he had been beaten in his genitals so severely that he lost consciousness.
Israeli leaders ‘incited genocide’
The report accused Netanyahu, President Isaac Herzog and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant of inciting genocide.
“As early as 7 October 2023, Israeli officials made statements that indicated their intention to destroy Palestinians in Gaza as a group,” the report said.
“Israeli political and military leaders are agents of the State of Israel; therefore, their acts are attributable to the State of Israel,” it said, adding that “Israeli authorities and Israeli security forces have had and continue to have the genocidal intent to destroy, in whole or in part, the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.”
In a statement to CNN, Herzog angrily dismissed the report, saying it suffered from a lack of legitimacy “so total that being named in their accusations is itself an endorsement of our fight for human rights.” Gallant declined to comment at this time. CNN has also reached out to Netanyahu for comment.
Israel’s closest ally also condemned the inquiry’s findings, with the US State Department calling it “the height of hypocrisy.”
“Israel went to war in self-defense and has consistently taken steps to minimize civilian casualties. That is not a genocide,” a department spokesperson told CNN. “This kind of equivocation by the UN is further evidence of its moral bankruptcy.”
The Trump administration has taken actions against those looking into alleged Israeli war crimes and has imposed sanctions on multiple International Criminal Court justices and UN Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese.
Pillay, the chair of the UN inquiry told CNN Tuesday that she had “expected” Israel to “challenge our factual findings” but has now come under personal attack for the report.
A press release published alongside the report called on the international community to “employ all means reasonably available to them to prevent the commission of genocide in Gaza.”
“The genocide in Gaza is unfolding in real time. The legal, moral and political duty of States is clear. The world must act now to stop the killing, to protect the Palestinian people, and to uphold its obligations to prevent and punish the crime of genocide,” it said.
CNN’s Kara Fox, Oren Liebermann, Tara John and Jennifer Hansler contributed reporting.
