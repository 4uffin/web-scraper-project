Sister Albertine Debacker, a 29-year-old who goes by @soeur.albertine, is an influencer with a difference. She gives advice and shares details of her life as a Catholic nun to more than 500,000 followers. It's part of a wider trend in France where the Catholic Church says it's seeing an unexpected revival among Gen Z, fuelled in part by social media. CNN's Joseph Ataman spoke to Sister Albertine at a youth festival in France to learn more about this fresh approach to faith.
