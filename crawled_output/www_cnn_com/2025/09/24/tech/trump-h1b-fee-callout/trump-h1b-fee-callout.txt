—
President Donald Trump’s surprise announcement that he would hike H1-B application fees to $100,000 sparked fear and confusion among foreign workers. It also sent the companies who employ them scrambling, forcing the White House to clarify that the fee would apply only to new applications, not existing H1-B workers.
The Trump administration says the fee is intended to curb abuse of the H1-B program.
But the new fee could have significant ramifications for the thousands of H1-B workers employed in the United States each year – and big costs for the firms who rely on the program to bring in highly skilled talent they can’t find at home.
So, we want to hear from you. If you are currently a foreign worker in the United States — or a foreign student hoping to stay and work in America — has this fee changed how you’re thinking about your future career path? Has your employer provided information about how they’ll navigate this new policy, or did you have to make last-minute travel changes following the announcement?
If you’re an employer with H1-B workers, how is this new policy going to affect your business expenses? Will you continue to employ H1-B talent in the United States, or seek to place employees in other offices around the world? How do you think this change will affect your ability to attract top talent?
Tell us about it in the form below, and please leave your contact information. No named commentary will be used without following up with you, and we can discuss anonymity based on your situation.
