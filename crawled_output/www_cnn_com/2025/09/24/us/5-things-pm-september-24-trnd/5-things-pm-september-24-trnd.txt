üëã Welcome to 5 Things PM! You might want to rethink winding down your evening with that glass of wine. A new study finds there is no safe amount of alcohol when it comes to dementia risk, challenging previous research.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Working in the shadows
Tattooing in this modern Asian country is rising in popularity, but the profession has been illegal for decades. That could soon change thanks to a new bill that artists hope will remove the barriers and secrecy.
2Ô∏è‚É£ ‚ÄòI like who I am‚Äô
President Donald Trump‚Äôs claims about autism are raising concerns among people who say his remarks cast blame on mothers and re-stigmatize those with the condition. Many in the community say they need support, not a cure.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Disney+ price hike
The cost of the subscription service is going up next month ‚Äî and the timing couldn‚Äôt be more awkward. The media giant is still reckoning with widespread backlash over benching Jimmy Kimmel last week and an ensuing boycott by some viewers before his show returned to the air.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Super polluters
A new interactive map allows people to track their region‚Äôs biggest sources of air pollution. Former US Vice President Al Gore, who partially funded the project, hopes it‚Äôll horrify and then motivate us to address the climate crisis.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Surf‚Äôs up
Abu Dhabi has warm weather, year-round sun and clear water. But there was one thing missing. Offering the longest artificial wave in the world, a company is targeting the ultra-rich searching for the perfect ride.
