The world‚Äôs first commercial space station is getting closer to launch. NASA is working with private companies to develop a modern successor to the aging International Space Station as its lifespan draws to a close.
Here‚Äôs what else you need to know to get up to speed and on with your day.
1Ô∏è‚É£ Jimmy Kimmel
Jimmy Kimmel made an emotional return to late-night TV on Tuesday after nearly a weeklong suspension. He received a standing ovation from audience members before his opening monologue, in which he addressed the controversy directly and assailed ‚Äúanti-American‚Äù efforts to curtail free speech in the US. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs important is that we live in a country that allows us to have a show like this,‚Äù Kimmel told viewers. He also discussed his September 15 remarks about Charlie Kirk‚Äôs suspected killer that led ABC to halt production of his show. ‚ÄúIt was never my intention to make light of the murder of a young man,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúNor was it my intention to blame any specific group for the actions of what was obviously a deeply disturbed individual.‚Äù Sinclair and Nexstar Media Group, which together own about one in five ABC affiliates nationwide, said they will still keep the show off their airwaves for now.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Trump‚Äôs UN speech
President Donald Trump lambasted the UN and countries around the world during a lengthy speech at the UN General Assembly on Tuesday. In largely off-script remarks, Trump criticized the UN over what he views as its ineffectiveness. He addressed the most pressing conflicts ‚Äî the wars in Ukraine and Gaza ‚Äî only in passing. Afterwards, Trump met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on the sidelines of the UNGA and shifted his tone about Russia‚Äôs ongoing invasion. The president on social media said Ukraine is now in a position to ‚Äúfight and WIN‚Äù back its original borders, escalating his rhetoric against Moscow. Trump also said NATO countries should shoot down Russian aircraft if they violate their airspace.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Climate change
Scientists have warned for years that climate change is happening and that it is mainly caused by fossil fuel pollution. But in remarks on Tuesday at the UN General Assembly, President Trump launched into a familiar tirade against the concept of global warming. The president called climate change ‚Äúthe greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world,‚Äù and he also referred to ‚Äúthe global warming hoax.‚Äù He didn‚Äôt precisely explain what he was calling the con job or hoax, but global warming is a demonstrated fact. The vast majority of climate scientists have concluded that the warming effects of climate change are making extreme weather events more powerful. Its toll is evident across the globe: heat waves are more intense, droughts are more widespread, and storms are more unpredictable and deadly.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Typhoon Ragasa
Nearly two million people in southern China have been evacuated as Typhoon Ragasa slams into one of the world‚Äôs most densely populated coasts. Packing hurricane-force winds, the storm has left a trail of damage, triggering landslides, flooding and huge waves. It is now bearing down on China‚Äôs Guangdong province, where massive cities like Shenzhen and Guangzhou are located. In Taiwan, at least 17 people died and rescuers are scrambling to locate several others missing after a natural dam holding back a recently formed lake collapsed, unleashing 68 million tons of water and flooding the nearby Guangfu township.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Epstein files
CNN projects Democrat Adelita Grijalva will win a US House special election in Arizona, which will deliver the decisive signature to the push for a vote to‚ÄØrelease the Jeffrey Epstein case files. The race was held to determine who would fill the seat held by her late father, Democratic Rep. Raul Grijalva, who died in March. Former Rep. Grijalva‚Äôs daughter was heavily favored against her Republican challenger, Daniel Butierez. House Democrats will now have the 218 members needed to force a vote on a contentious measure that would require the Trump administration to turn over any information related to Epstein. Few Republicans back forcing a vote, although several support the bill itself to compel the full release of the documents. Still, it would face an uphill battle in the Senate if it passed the House.
