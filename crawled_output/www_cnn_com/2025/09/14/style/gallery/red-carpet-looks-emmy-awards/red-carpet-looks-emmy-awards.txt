Red carpet season is well and truly underway. The biggest — and most stylish — names in television descended on LA’s Peacock Theater for the 77th Primetime Emmy Awards.Compared to the bold looks at last weekend’s MTV Video Music Awards, this is a typically more formal affair. The elegant eveningwear on show can offer clues about the trends that will unfold between now and the Oscars next March.Fashion-forward cast members of series like “The White Lotus," “The Last of Us” and "The Bear," all of which received multiple Emmy nominations, are among those in attendance.
