Dr. Gupta on potential association between Tylenol use during pregnancy and autism: ‘Not a cause and effect’
Link Copied!
An upcoming US Department of Health and Human Services report will link autism to a common pain reliever, according to the Wall Street Journal.
Reportedly, HHS is said to highlight Tylenol when taken during pregnancy, along with low levels of folate as potential causes of autism.
CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta explains how association does not necessarily indicate causation.
