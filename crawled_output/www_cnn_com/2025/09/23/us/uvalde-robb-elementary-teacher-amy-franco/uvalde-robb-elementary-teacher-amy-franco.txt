She did the work of a hero. But this teacher says she’s been portrayed as a villain for 3 years

Uvalde, Texas
—
When teacher Amy Marin-Franco saw a pickup truck crash in a ditch outside her school, her first thought was to get help.
When a young man got out of the truck with a gun, she abruptly pivoted — she still wanted to get help, but now to protect the children and staff inside her school.
“I wasn’t a coward,” she told CNN.
But in the words of law enforcement, she became something worse: someone who had failed to follow protocol and unwittingly helped a murderous teen enter an elementary school where he killed 19 children and two teachers in the deadliest school shooting for a decade.
Except it wasn’t true.
And although officials walked back their denunciation of her a few days later, Marin-Franco says the doubts have lingered around her ever since, from neighbor and stranger alike. For weeks after the shooting, she said she did not go anywhere. When she finally went to a school board meeting, she sat at the back, afraid the bereaved families packing the front rows would attack her. To this day, she says people still believe the lie. “I see it every day,” she said. “You can feel the division, you can feel the people that are, ‘Hmm, she left the door open.’”
There’s even proof on surveillance video of what she did and did not do. Marin-Franco believes this evidence will clear her name forever, but it’s caught up in a yearslong effort by local and state officials in Texas to keep public records hidden.
“That’s the video that I’m looking at, because I want to make it a point that I didn’t run straight to my room to hide,” she said. “I didn’t think about myself. I was thinking about saving lives.”
From planning a party to panic
It was May 24, 2022, in the last week of school before the summer holidays at Robb Elementary in Uvalde. The fourth grade had had their awards ceremony earlier in the morning and Marin-Franco was getting ready for a dance party for her after-school students.
She pushed a wheeled cart from her corner classroom into a hallway adorned with a massive hand-colored “Congrats Class of 2022” poster. As she headed out to the parking lot to get supplies, she nudged a rock to the frame of the side door to stop the door closing fully. It was against district policy, but a common practice among teachers in the building to use the rock as they stepped outside to get something from their cars or take a short break outside.
“Oh my god, he has a gun!”
Amy Marin-Franco to 911 operator
When the truck crashed, Marin-Franco ran back to her classroom to get her phone to call 911. “There was just an accident right here behind Robb school,” she told the dispatcher as soon as the call was connected, a recording showed.
Still on the phone to give more details, Marin-Franco was heading toward the truck when her voice suddenly changed. First there was confusion about the actions of two men from a nearby funeral home who had also gone to help.
“They’re running, I don’t know why,” she told the dispatcher. Then shock and alarm when she saw the man get out of the truck and shoot at them. “Oh my god, he has a gun!”
Marin-Franco ran back to the school building and opened the door. Surveillance video clearly shows her pushing the rock out of the way with the sole of her right foot before slamming the entry door closed.

“The video shows me running into the building and I close the door. I kick the rock and I close the door,” she told CNN.
A Department of Justice investigation found this action should have locked the door, though there was no way to check from the inside. And CNN revealed maintenance records just this month that showed repeated problems with that entry door, and many other internal and external doors before the shooting.
The hallway surveillance video shows Marin-Franco banging on a colleague’s door to ask her to get a lockdown initiated while she stays on the phone with the police dispatcher, returning to the entry door to peer outside to try to get more information on the shooter’s approach.
“I’m holding the door shut. I have the phone in my left hand and I’m telling her, ‘Black hoodie, black hair. He threw a gun. He threw a bag. He threw another gun. He jumped the fence.’”
A minute before the gunman walked into her building, Marin-Franco went to her empty classroom, closing the door about 30 seconds before he entered. She had no key to lock it, she said.
“I kept looking to the door to see if the shooter was coming into my room.” Marin-Franco recalled frantic moments as she thought about going into the hallway or finding a place to hide, eventually crouching under a counter in her room.
Marin-Franco whispered to the operator that the shooter was inside the building, before the line cut. “The rounds are still going off, but after every round, it was total silence,” she said.
She remembers her mind running wild, accepting her fate while running through scenarios to tackle the shooter.
“And then I hear voices. I’m like, ‘What is that? Those are the cops,’” she said.
Police officers entered the school through the same door as the gunman — and less than three minutes after him. But after an initial approach during which they came under fire, they lost momentum, waiting for keys or breaching tools or specialist personnel. Much of that time, the first responders huddled at either end of the hallway, many of them outside Marin-Franco’s classroom.

She waited until, apparently by chance, an officer opened the door to a connecting classroom and escorted her out.
“I never moved until finally, somebody came in, got me out.”
That was a little more than 20 minutes after officers first entered the school. It would be another 52 minutes before they confronted the gunman and got help for the victims.
Though he crashed his grandparents’ pickup off the campus, the gunman had no trouble getting to the school. He shot at windows and pulled open the door Marin-Franco had slammed shut. And that became a critical point of failure for law enforcement chiefs looking to make the early apportionment of blame.
Watching her life be shredded, live on TV
Robb Elementary School was the softest of soft targets. A 5-foot perimeter fence was no barrier to someone determined to climb over. There was no full-time security. And there were multiple entrances to multiple buildings.
Three days after the shooting, it was becoming clear something had gone hugely wrong in the law enforcement response. Hundreds of officers went to the school, but it took them 77 minutes to shoot and kill the gunman.
Rumors and misinformation about what had happened were also rife.
Col. Steve McCraw, then-director of the Texas Department of Public Safety, the lead law enforcement agency in the state, took time to set some of the record straight.
“We’re here to report the facts as we know them now,” he told reporters on May 27, giving details from video surveillance, 911 calls from inside the classrooms where the shooter was, and evidence that had been collected.

He ran through a timeline, clarified a police officer had encountered a sports coach and not the shooter outside the school and discussed what the hallway surveillance camera showed — that Marin-Franco propped the door open to go outside and ran back inside to get her cellphone. But he said nothing about her kicking out the rock and pulling the door closed.
In response to a question, he went further, saying: “That back door was propped open. It wasn’t supposed to be propped open. It was supposed to be locked,” he said. “Certainly, the teacher that went back for her cellphone propped it open again, so that was an access point that the subject used.”
At home with her daughter, Marin-Franco watched McCraw shred her life, live on TV.
“I looked up at her and I kept saying. ‘I closed the door. I closed the door,’” Marin-Franco told CNN. “I (was) shaking again uncontrollably. I couldn’t control myself.”
She felt so unwell, she asked her daughter to take her to the hospital to be checked out.
“The nurse, she’s taking my vitals, and I’m looking at her, and I’m telling her, ‘I closed the door, I closed the door,’ and I’m shaking from head to toe,” Marin-Franco recalled. “She said, ‘You need to calm down, are you going to faint on me?’ And I looked up at her and I kept saying, ‘I closed the door. I closed the door.’”
Marin-Franco was visited at the hospital the next day by her supervisor, whom she begged to help her set the record straight. The colleague was there when a Texas Ranger and an FBI agent came to say they had reviewed the video and saw she had pulled the door shut.

That colleague emailed the leadership of the Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District: “Amy is already under much stress from having lived the tragedy that we do not want her to endure any more suffering due to misinformation.” She added: “Amy was adamant about wanting you to know these facts as they related to her.”
A week after the shooting, DPS spokesperson Travis Considine told The Associated Press Marin-Franco’s story had been confirmed. “We did verify she closed the door. The door did not lock. We know that much and now investigators are looking into why it did not lock,” he said.
Months later, McCraw acknowledged the error could have been corrected sooner. “I did say the teacher pushed the rock in the door. I said that on that Friday, and didn’t correct it until the next week,” he told a meeting of the state Public Safety Commission in October, 2022, adding: “When we found out about it, we certainly corrected it on the record.”
Marin-Franco said a statement was issued to her family, but she has never considered it sufficient. “They never called me. They never called my kids. They never apologized to me,” she said.
Small-town connections are everywhere
Uvalde is a small town, where families and lives are all intertwined. Parents who lost their children still see the officers who waited in the hallway at the grocery store. Some of the responders had children at Robb. Marin-Franco’s grandson was a Robb second grader, in a different building. A school police officer was married to one of the teachers who died. And pretty much everyone knows each other’s business.
Many people knew it was Marin-Franco who was called out by McCraw, even if her name was not used. And as she suffered the reproachful looks and comments, she was also troubled by another small-town connection.
“When I go to sleep — which is very little — I try to sleep, and I see his face.”
Amy Marin-Franco, of the teenaged killer
The week before the massacre, she had grabbed some food at the local Wendy’s, where she was served by a young man who would soon buy two rifles and take them and a stockpile of ammunition into her elementary school.
“He gave me my food and there was nothing ugly about him. There was nothing evil about him,” Marin-Franco said of how he seemed. Now, she does whatever she can to block his face from her mind.
“When I go to sleep — which is very little — I try to sleep, and I see his face.”
Marin-Franco, now 60, has not worked since the day of the shooting. She still shakes and limps as a result of the mental and physical exertion of what happened. Panic attacks can be triggered by a siren or when washing her hands.

She lives alone and spends her time praying and reading. She also paints, which can help calm the shaking in her hand when she focuses intently on the brush. She sells some of her work to pay bills.
Paintings she has made of sunflowers hang on the wall in her living room, but she would leave Uvalde if she could afford to.
“If I want to heal, I’m not going to do it here,” she said. “I was a different person. But she died that day. I see my pictures from before. That’s not me anymore.”
For now, she still feels the need to show people what she did.
“I want the whole world to see that I did not run straight to my room to hide. I was warning everybody that there was a shooter on campus,” she said. “I did not stand around like all those 376 officers did. I was warning everybody to get in their rooms.”
Although CNN and other media organizations obtained copies of the surveillance video three years ago, there has still been no public release of the unedited footage. The city and county of Uvalde and the school district have published — or at least promised to publish — public records but the Texas DPS is still fighting to keep materials secret. That includes the surveillance video taken from Robb Elementary soon after the massacre, which the school district says is the only copy.
DPS told CNN it had no plans to release the video. “The video you reference was collected as evidence in a criminal investigation and is currently held as evidence in a pending criminal prosecution,” it said in a statement.
More than three years later, Marin-Franco got one thing she had needed — an apology from her former employers. She said she had never been contacted by anyone from the school district, from the forwarded pleas when she was in the hospital, right up to a school board meeting late last month.
There she berated the board members for failing to release the public records as they had promised.
“You asked us to trust you, but how can we?” she asked. “You say you stand for transparency, but you have withheld the very footage that will clear my name and show the courage and truth of what I did that day.”
After the district’s lawyers admitted a mistake was made and there would be more information released — not including the video — board member JJ Suarez took time to address her, saying he had seen the footage through media.
Amy Marin-Franco speaks at a Uvalde School Board meeting on August 25, where she said she had lost faith in their pledges of transparency.
CNN
“I’m glad that video was there because you have been through so much, and that video, how it got out, I don’t know, because we don’t have that, our district doesn’t have it, but it got out somewhere. It cleared you, Amy, it cleared you from any wrongdoing and anything that you were accused of.”
In a subsequent meeting — and with new legal representation — the school board went further regarding its files that are being held by DPS, including the video.
“The district has requested those records but those have not been provided,” lawyer Philip Fraissinet explained.
“The board would like to file a brief urging the court to release all records and recordings that were taken from the district and are in DPS’s possession.”
The hour was nearing midnight, but Marin-Franco was still there, hoping to witness one more step forward in her journey for truth.
