1Ô∏è‚É£ ‚ÄòDay-zero droughts‚Äô
Many parts of the world are predicted to endure periods of extreme and unprecedented water scarcity, a study found. It‚Äôs not clear exactly when and where the dire shortages will hit, but new research suggests some surprising answers.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Kids left stranded
Children across the US have ended up in the care of relatives, neighbors, friends, coworkers ‚Äî and even strangers ‚Äî after ICE detained or deported their parents. CNN identified more than 100 young American citizens, from newborns to teens, in that situation.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Road to recovery
A 26-mile stretch of the Blue Ridge Parkway reopened in western North Carolina ‚Äî just in time for the busy fall season. It marks a major milestone in the state‚Äôs rebuilding efforts nearly one year after Hurricane Helene devastated the region.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Estate planning
Before you die, you can avoid leaving behind a financial mess by being meticulous about identifying who you want to get your money. Just be aware that certain rules dictate who receives your riches, regardless of what‚Äôs in your will.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Healthy habits
CNN‚Äôs Madeline Holcombe spends a lot of time reporting on new research findings in the health and wellness field, and she just got in on the ground floor of a new study. Here‚Äôs how you can join.
