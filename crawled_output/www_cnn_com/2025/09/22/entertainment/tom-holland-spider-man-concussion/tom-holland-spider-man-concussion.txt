Spider-Man had a bit of an accident.
Tom Holland, who has starred as the superhero in films since 2016, suffered a “mild concussion,” a source with knowledge of the production told CNN.
“Tom experienced a mild concussion and out of precaution, he will take a break from filming and is expected to return to work in a few days,” the source said.
“Thankfully, no one else was affected and production will continue on as planned,” the individual added.
The actor was not hospitalized as a result of the injury.
CNN has contacted representatives for Sony, Marvel and Holland for comment.

Tom Holland says ‘Spider-Man 4’ will be a ‘breath of fresh air’ after Covid forced last movie to be shot on sound stages
“Spider-Man: Brand New Day” is currently in production. It will be the fourth web-slinger film led by Holland, 29.
“It’s been such a long time that I’ve done it that it’s going to feel like a breath of fresh air,” he said of the project in July. “I think the fans are going to be over the moon with what we’re putting together.”
CNN’s Jack Guy contributed to this story.
