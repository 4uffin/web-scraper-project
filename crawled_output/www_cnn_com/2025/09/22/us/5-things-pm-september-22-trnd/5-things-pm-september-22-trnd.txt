üëã Welcome to 5 Things PM! ‚ÄúJimmy Kimmel Live!‚Äù will return to the air Tuesday night, ABC announced. The show‚Äôs yanking last week sparked a national debate about freedom of speech.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Cultural celebrations
Despite concerns about immigration raids, people took to the streets of cities across the US to honor Mexican Independence Day and Hispanic Heritage Month. Some of the festivities were scaled down because the Trump administration has been making arrests during routine immigration checks, at courthouses and at worksites.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Literacy crisis
Reading levels in the US dropped to historic lows during the pandemic. Now parents, teachers and tech companies are hoping artificial intelligence can help. Questions remain about whether AI is the solution or part of the problem.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Watching your weight?
In some cases, you can stop blaming yourself for that expanding waistline. A leading researcher, who busted some nutritional myths that have led to fat-shaming, says the food supply is working against you.
4Ô∏è‚É£ ‚ÄòBest and brightest‚Äô
NASA introduced 10 new astronauts as it races to return to the moon before attempting an unprecedented crewed mission to Mars. The six women and four men were selected from a pool of 8,000 applicants.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Chance encounter
A British couple were feeling lost while on vacation in the Bahamas. That‚Äôs when an American couple stepped in to help. Nearly 40 years after meeting in a taxi line, they‚Äôre still friends.
