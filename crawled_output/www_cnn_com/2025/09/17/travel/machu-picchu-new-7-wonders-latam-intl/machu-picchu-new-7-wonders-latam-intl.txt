Machu Picchu is at risk of losing its ‘credibility’ as one of the New 7 Wonders of the World. What’s happening?

It was in 2007 when Peru’s Machu Picchu Inca sanctuary was designated one of the New 7 Wonders of the World after receiving more than 100 million votes in a global competition.
Now, the New7Wonders project, which organized the vote, warns that Machu Picchu is at risk of losing its “credibility” as one of the wonders due to overtourism, limited conservation policies and social conflicts, among other issues.
In a statement over the weekend, the organization said that everything depends on the country’s “key decision-makers,” who it says have received proposals to implement a strategic transformation plan for the site.
“The designation implies a shared commitment to the conservation and responsible management of the site, as well as the implementation of international preservation and management standards,” the statement said.
Asked if Machu Picchu could lose its spot on the list and whether a different site could take its place, New7Wonders told CNN that it was too soon to discuss what the process would be, how it would work or if it would happen.
“This is premature, especially as we believe all stakeholders can and should consider this a wake-up call to get the house of Machu Picchu in order. We already have an official representative adviser in Peru itself, who is ready to support the process toward both short term and more importantly long-term solutions,” Director Jean-Paul de la Fuente said.

The halt of the tourism industry caused many to loose their jobs and has led to the slow deterioration of some of the well known tourist sites.

Machu Picchu is older than previously thought
Machu Picchu was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1983. That designation is not at risk as it is not associated with the New7Wonders campaign.
Peru’s Ministry of Culture has not directly commented on the New7Wonders statement. However, hours later it said on X that UNESCO, the UN’s culture agency, was “the only competent body to promote the identification, protection and preservation of cultural and natural heritage.”
The ministry said the “preservation and protection” of Machu Picchu “is not being violated” and that it is not included on UNESCO’s List of World Heritage in Danger. It added that during the 47th meeting of the World Heritage Committee held in July in Paris, UNESCO “valued the improvements in visitor management and the implementation of monitoring and conservation tools for the historic sanctuary of Machu Picchu.”
CNN has requested additional comment from the ministry.
Meanwhile, Peru’s Ministry of Commerce and Tourism said it was scheduled to meet with the country’s tourism associations this Tuesday to seek a consensual solution to the “complex situation” at Machu Picchu.
What’s happening in Machu Picchu now?
Protests over transportation concessions have left thousands of travelers stranded around Machu Picchu in recent days, according to the Cusco Chamber of Tourism. The city of Cusco in the Andes mountains is a common gateway destination for travelers bound for Machu Picchu.
The problem began in early September with demonstrations over control of the concession for the route leading to the sanctuary. The protests escalated on Monday, when Cusco residents blocked the train tracks leading to the site.

Peru evacuated some 1,400 tourists overnight from the train station that serves the Inca citadel of Machu Picchu, while about 900 others remained stranded as protesters blocked the railway tracks to demand a new company be chosen to run the buses that ferry visitors from the Aguas Calientes train station, at the foot of Machu Picchu, to the site itself.

Hundreds of tourists left stranded near Machu Picchu after protests
The Peruvian Ombudsman’s Office announced on Wednesday that protesters had reached an agreement to suspend demonstrations for 72 hours and allow the resumption of transit services.
CNN has reached out to the Cusco regional government and the Cusco Chamber of Tourism for comment on the New7Wonders statements and the range of problems the sanctuary is reportedly facing.
Part of a bigger problem?
Are these issues recent or are they part of a larger, long-standing structural problem?
New7Wonders Director Jean-Paul de la Fuente told CNN that the situation has been brewing for many years.
According to the organization, recent years have seen “various intensified challenges that require priority attention: high pressure from tourism, rising prices for services and goods, the risk of damage to historical heritage, reports of irregular practices linked to ticket sales, difficulties in land transportation, as well as limitations in management and conservation policies. Added to this are social conflicts, lack of coordination between institutions and tourism companies, and repeated complaints from visitors.”
In 2023, CNN reported that train services on the route to Machu Picchu were suspended due to a group of residents holding a strike, blocking the railway tracks in protest of the Peruvian government’s decision regarding the online sale of tickets to the sanctuary.
Machu Picchu is expected to exceed 1.5 million visitors this year. That figure would break a previous record for the highest number of visitors in a year, which was reached in 2019, before the pandemic, according to Culture Minister Fabricio Valencia.
