—
A US immigration judge ordered pro-Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil be deported to Algeria or Syria over claims that he omitted information from his green card application, court documents showed on Wednesday.
Khalil’s lawyers said they intend to appeal the deportation order while saying a federal district court’s separate orders that prohibit the government from immediately deporting or detaining him as his federal court case proceeds remain in effect.
This is a developing story and will be updated.
