Claude can understand project architecture, identify cross-file dependencies, and suggest improvements that account for the complete system design.Document synthesis: Process extensive document sets like legal contracts, research papers, or technical specifications. Analyze relationships across hundreds of documents while maintaining full context.Context-aware agents: Build agents that maintain context across hundreds of tool calls and multi-step workflows. Include complete API documentation, tool definitions, and interaction histories without losing coherence.API pricingTo account for increased computational requirements, pricing adjusts for prompts over 200K tokens: InputOutputPrompts ≤ 200K$3 / MTok$15 / MTokPrompts > 200K$6 / MTok$22.50 / MTokClaude Sonnet 4 pricing on the Anthropic APIWhen combined with prompt caching, users can reduce latency and costs for Claude Sonnet 4 with long context. The 1M context window can also be used with batch processing for an additional 50% cost savings.Customer spotlight: Bolt.newBolt.new transforms web development by integrating Claude into their browser-based development platform.“Claude Sonnet 4 remains our go-to model for code generation workflows, consistently outperforming other leading models in production. With the 1M context window, developers can now work on significantly larger projects while maintaining the high accuracy we need for real-world coding," said Eric Simons, CEO and Co-founder of Bolt.new.Customer spotlight: iGent AILondon-based iGent AI is advancing the field of software development with Maestro, an AI partner that transforms conversations into executable code."What was once impossible is now reality: Claude Sonnet 4 with 1M token context has supercharged autonomous capabilities in Maestro, our software engineering agent at iGent AI. This leap unlocks true production-scale engineering—multi-day sessions on real-world codebases—establishing a new paradigm in agentic software engineering," said Sean Ward, CEO and Co-founder of iGent AI.Get startedLong context support for Sonnet 4 is now in public beta on the Claude Developer Platform for customers with Tier 4 and custom rate limits, with broader availability rolling out over the coming weeks. Long context is also available in Amazon Bedrock and on Google Cloud's Vertex AI. We’re also exploring how to bring long context to other Claude products.To learn more about Sonnet 4 and the 1M context window, see our documentation and pricing page.NewsClaude is now available in Microsoft 365 Copilot Sep 24, 2025NewsClaude is now generally available in XcodeSep 15, 2025NewsStrengthening our safeguards through collaboration with US CAISI and UK AISI Sep 12, 2025ProductsClaudeClaude CodeMax planTeam planEnterprise planDownload appPricingLog in to ClaudeModelsOpusSonnetHaikuSolutionsAI agentsCode modernizationCodingCustomer supportEducationFinancial servicesGovernmentClaude Developer PlatformOverviewDeveloper docsPricingAmazon BedrockGoogle Cloud’s Vertex AIConsole loginLearnCoursesConnectorsCustomer storiesEngineering at AnthropicEventsPowered by ClaudeService partnersStartups programCompanyAnthropicCareersEconomic FuturesResearchNewsResponsible Scaling PolicySecurity and complianceTransparencyHelp and securityAvailabilityStatusSupport centerTerms and policiesPrivacy policyResponsible disclosure policyTerms of service: CommercialTerms of service: ConsumerUsage policy© 2025 Anthropic PBC
