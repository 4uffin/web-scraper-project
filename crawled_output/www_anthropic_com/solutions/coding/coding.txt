She went from being downtrodden and skeptical to dancing around the room in about 15 minutes. END USER PROGRAMMING IS NOW.âKasey, @kaseyklimesâClaude Sonnet 3.5 is utterly cracked for coding. This thing refactors like a monster. Not a single mistake, total understanding of every detail and intricacy. Just teleported my code forward in time, so many bloating functions cleaned up. It optimizes code so well. This is crazy.âNicolas Martel, @ryunuckâSome interesting data on how Anthropic's Sonnet 3.5 seems to remain by far the most capable LLM for coding. Every single leading GenAI-powered IDE (Cursor, Windsurf, Zed, Copilot etc) favor this model. A good question: how is Claude so much better for code generation?âGergely Orosz, @GergelyOroszâCursor + Claude 3.5 Sonnet has made it 10x more fun to be a CEO who codes.âSahil Lavingia, @shlâI know this sounds cringe, but I literally have clammy hands and a racing heart because of how powerful Claude + Cursor is. Like I just made a whole new feature, frontend and backend, built on top of my own custom APIs without touching code, then I had it switch from a SwiftUI.âMajd Taby, @jtabyâI taught a friend who has never written code in her life how to use Claude to build a simple app and deploy it on Cloudflare today. Watching someone realize that they can now build software is a great experience. Enable everyone to build anything.âLogan Grasby, @LoganGrasbyâWith new Claude i officially feel like a fraud when i code, Iâm the guy in the corner saying um nice job boss keep going.âNick, @nickcammarataâClaude 3.5 sonnet is actually good at writing code, the AI posters were right, which makes me sick to my stomach, to have to hand those guys one.âDan Nolan, @dannolanâThe updated Claude Sonnet 3.5 is vastly superior to all OpenAI models for everyday tasks. Easiest subscription swap ever. Feels like OpenAI is fumbling their massive lead.âJonathan Munan, @JonathanMunanâI'm an infra and backend guy, but with Claude 3.5 Sonnet being so good, I now feel like Iâm an everything guy.âEthan, @ethancatzelPrevPrevNextNextBuild products with the Claude Developer PlatformIntegrate Claudeâs powerful AI capabilities into your apps and deliver production-grade solutions faster.View promptView promptView promptExisting promptClassify all customer support tickets into the most relevant category.Here is the list of categories to choose from:{{CATEGORY_LIST}}Here is the content of the support ticket:{{TICKET_CONTENT}}What would you like to improve?Please include a rationale for the classification.You are an AI assistant specialized in classifying customer support tickets.

Opus 4.1 delivers a one standard deviation improvement over Opus 4. Very excited for our users to feel this difference.âJeff Wang, CEOâClaude Opus 4 and Sonnet 4 are state of the art coding models. Theyâre a leap forward in complex codebase understanding, and we expect developers will experience across the board capability improvements.âMichael Truell, Co-founder & CEOâAnthropic has again set the gold standard for code-generation models with Claude Opus 4 and Sonnet 4. With a modest shift in prompting, we've seen the new models deliver cleaner, more precise high-quality output.âJared Palmer, VP of Product (AI)âClaude Opus 4 offers truly advanced reasoning for coding. When our team deployed it on a complex open source project, it coded autonomously for nearly seven hoursâa huge leap in AI capabilities that left the team amazed.âYusuke Kaji, General Manager (AI)âClaude Opus 4 pushes the envelope once again on coding capabilities, handling complex multi-file changes without touching code you didnât ask to modify. The improved precision in instruction following plus thinking mode gains show real potential to fundamentally change how Replit Agent works.âMichele Catasta, PresidentRead storyRead storyRead storyâClaude Opus 4 is the first model that boosts code quality during editing and debugging in its agent, codename goose, without sacrificing performance or reliability.âBradley Axen, Principal Data & ML EngineerâClaude Sonnet 4 has soared in agentic scenarios and weâre excited to introduce it as the base model for the new coding agent in GitHub Copilot. In early internal evaluations, the model demonstrated up to 10% improvement over the previous Sonnet generation, driven by adaptive tool use, precise instruction-following, and strong coding instincts.âThomas Dohmke, CEOâClaude Opus 4 excels at solving complex challenges that other models canât. It successfully handles critical actions that previous models have missedâthat kind of reliability is transformative for our development workflows.âScott Wu, Co-founder & CEOâClaude Sonnet 4 surpasses Sonnet 3.7 with higher success rates, more surgical code edits, and more tightly scoped changes. It works more carefully through complex tasks and delivers superior code qualityâmaking it the ideal choice as the primary coding model in Augment Code.âGuy Gur-Ari, Co-founderâAgainst our in-house benchmark, Claude Opus 4 was a dramatic improvement in code generation abilities compared to Anthropicâs previous models. We're incredibly excited to see such progress, and for the product opportunities this unlocks.âAmy Heineike, Founding AI EngineerâClaude Sonnet 4âs code quality is incredibleâit stays on track longer, understands problems deeply, and creates elegant solutions instead of brute-forcing fixes. This shows promise to be a substantial leap in software development!âBeyang Liu, CTOPrevPrevNextNext100K+applications deployed on Google Cloud run75%engineers saving 8â10+ hours every weekGet the technical rundownLearn how to use Claude and the Anthropic APILearn how to use Claude and the Anthropic APILearn how to use Claude and the Anthropic APIDeveloper docsDeveloper docsDeveloper docsStart building with our quickstart guidesStart building with our quickstart guidesStart building with our quickstart guidesQuickstartQuickstartQuickstartHow Anthropic teams use Claude CodeHow Anthropic teams use Claude CodeHow Anthropic teams use Claude CodeCase studyCase studyCase studyHomepageHomepageNextNextThank you!
