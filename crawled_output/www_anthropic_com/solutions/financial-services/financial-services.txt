With the incorporation of Claudeâs advanced capabilities into our underwriting process, we have been able to compress the timeline to review business by more than 5x in our early rollouts while simultaneously improving our data accuracy from 75% to over 90%. This collaboration is about propelling growth and providing our underwriters the tools to make better decisions at an accelerated pace, ultimately driving our ability to serve more clients with greater insight.âPeter Zaffino, CEOâWe see AI agents as the next evolution of commerceâautonomous systems that can predict, suggest, and find the products and services consumers need. This means AI that can find the best price for âthat dressâ or can make everyday purchases on your behalf at the right time. This is only possible with a secure foundation at the base built on consent, privacy, transparency, and security. We are delighted that Anthropic is a key partner of Visa to make this dream a reality and shares our values and principles around responsible data usage (and we trust Claude to underpin this vision). Because when AI is moving money, safety and trust are non-negotiable.âRajat Taneja, President, TechnologyOur strategic partnership with Anthropic is foundational to our success and our strategy to become a global leader in AI innovation in banking.
