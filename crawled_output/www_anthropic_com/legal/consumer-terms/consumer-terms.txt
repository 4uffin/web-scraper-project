However, if the organization is responsible for notifying you or has already informed you that it may monitor and control your Account, we may not provide additional notice.Evaluation and Additional Services. In some cases, we may permit you to evaluate our Services for a limited time or with limited functionality. Use of our Services for evaluation purposes are for your personal, non-commercial use only.You may need to accept additional terms to use certain Services.

Inputs, Outputs, Actions, and Materials.Generally. You may be allowed to interact with our Services in a variety of formats (we call these “Inputs”). Our Services may generate responses (we call these “Outputs”), or enable the Services to take actions on your behalf, such as software manipulation, data processing, and system interactions (we call these "Actions"), based on your Inputs. Inputs and Outputs collectively are “Materials.”Rights and Responsibilities. You are responsible for all Inputs you submit to our Services and all Actions. By submitting Inputs to our Services, you represent and warrant that you have all rights, licenses, and permissions that are necessary for us to process the Inputs under our Terms and to provide the Services to you, including for example, to integrate with third-party services, to share Materials with others at your direction, and to take Actions. You also represent and warrant that your submitting Inputs to us or directing Claude to take Actions will not violate our Terms, our Acceptable Use Policy, or any laws or regulations applicable to those Inputs or Actions. As between you and Anthropic, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, you retain any right, title, and interest that you have in the Inputs you submit. Subject to your compliance with our Terms, we assign to you all of our right, title, and interest—if any—in Outputs.Reliance on Outputs and Actions. Artificial intelligence and large language models are frontier technologies that are still improving in accuracy, reliability and safety. When you use our Services, you acknowledge and agree:Outputs may not always be accurate and may contain material inaccuracies even if they appear accurate because of their level of detail or specificity.Actions may not be error free or operate as you intended.You should not rely on any Outputs or Actions without independently confirming their accuracy.The Services and any Outputs may not reflect correct, current, or complete information.Outputs may contain content that is inconsistent with Anthropic’s views.Our use of Materials. We may use Materials to provide, maintain, and improve the Services and to develop other products and services, including training our models, unless you opt out of training through your account settings. Even if you opt out, we will use Materials for model training when: (1) you provide Feedback to us regarding any Materials, or (2) your Materials are flagged for safety review to improve our ability to detect harmful content, enforce our policies, or advance our safety research.5. FeedbackWe appreciate feedback, including ideas and suggestions for improvement or rating an Output in response to an Input (“Feedback”). If you rate an Output in response to an Input—for example, by using the thumbs up/thumbs down icon—we will store the related conversation as part of your Feedback. You have no obligation to give us Feedback, but if you do, you agree that we may use the Feedback however we choose without any obligation or other payment to you.6. Subscriptions, fees and payment.Fees and billing. You may be required to pay us fees to access or use our Services or certain features of our Services. You are responsible for paying any applicable fees listed for the Services on the Model Pricing Page unless otherwise communicated to you by Anthropic in writing.If you purchase access to our Services or features of our Services, you must provide complete and accurate billing information (“Payment Method”). You agree that we may charge the Payment Method for any applicable fees listed on our Services and any applicable tax. If the fees for these Services or features are specified to be recurring or based on usage, you agree that we may charge these fees and applicable taxes to the Payment Method on a periodic basis.If you purchase access to our Services through a distributor (e.g. an app store) (“App Distributor”), then you will make payment to the App Distributor, and the App Distributor’s terms in relation to payment methods, billing, and refunds will apply instead of these Terms.Except as expressly provided in these Terms or where required by law, all payments are non-refundable. Please check your order carefully before confirming it, and see below for additional information about recurring charges for our subscriptions.Additional fees. We may increase fees for our Services. If we charge additional fees in connection with our Services, we will give you an opportunity to review and accept the additional fees before you are charged. Also, additional fees may apply for additional Services or features of the Services that we may make available. If you do not accept any such additional fees, we may discontinue your access to the Services or features.You agree that we will not be held liable for any errors caused by third-party payment processors used to process fees paid by you to us.Subscriptions. To access Claude Pro and other subscription services we may make available to individuals, you must sign up for a subscription with us (a “Subscription”), first by creating an Account, and then following the subscription procedure on our Services. When you sign up for a Subscription, you agree to these Terms.Subscription content, features, and services. The content, features, and other services provided as part of your Subscription, and the duration of your Subscription, will be described in the order process. We may change the content, features, and other services from time to time, and we do not guarantee that any particular piece of content, feature, or other service will always be available through the Services.Subscription term and automatic renewal. If you sign up for a paid Subscription, we or the App Distributor will automatically charge your Payment Method on each agreed-upon periodic renewal date until you cancel. If your Subscription has a minimum term (the “Initial Term”), we will let you know during the order process. Your Subscription will last for the Initial Term and will automatically renew, and your Payment Method will be charged, at the end of the Initial Term for an additional term equal in duration to the Initial Term and will continue to renew and incur charges for additional terms equal in duration to the Initial Term (each such additional term, a “Renewal Term”) until you cancel.Subscription cancellation. If you subscribed via our website, you may cancel your Subscription for any reason by using a method we may provide to you through our products—for example, for Claude Pro, in your customer portal—or by notifying us at support@anthropic.com. If you subscribed via an app, you’ll need to cancel via the App Distributor according to the App Distributor’s terms. Learn more here. To avoid renewal and charges for the next Renewal Term, cancel your subscription at least 24 hours before the last day of the Initial Term or any Renewal Term. For example, if you subscribe on January 25th for a Subscription with a one-month Initial Term, you must cancel the Subscription per the instructions by February 23rd (24 hours before February 24th) to avoid renewal and charges for the next Renewal Term. In the event of a cancellation, your fees will not be refunded, but your access to the Services will continue through the end of the Initial Term or any Renewal Term for which you previously paid fees.Additional cancellation rights. If you are a resident of Brazil, Mexico, South Korea, or Taiwan, you have a legal right to change your mind and cancel the Subscription within 7 days of entering into the Subscription without giving a reason.To exercise the right to cancel in the 7-day cancellation period, you must inform us of your decision to cancel the Subscription by making a clear statement to us of such decision before the cancellation period has expired. The easiest way to do this is by cancelling your subscription in the customer portal, or you may contact us at support@anthropic.com. You may also use the model cancellation form in Appendix 1 of these Terms, but it is not obligatory. For further details on how to cancel, please see support.anthropic.com. We will acknowledge your cancellation, e.g., through our online customer portal or console.If you cancel the Subscription under Section 6(4)(a), we will reimburse you all payments received from you for the cancelled Subscription. We will make the reimbursement without undue delay, and not later than 14 days after the day on which we are informed about your decision to cancel the Subscription. We will make the reimbursement using the same means of payment as you used for the initial transaction; you will not incur any fees as a result of the reimbursement.If you would like to use the Services during the 7-day cancellation period, you may do so. If you have used the Services during the 7-day cancellation period, and wish to cancel the Subscription, you can still do so by following the process in Section (4)(a) above, but we may retain an amount which is in proportion to what has been provided until you have communicated us your withdrawal from these Terms, in comparison with the full coverage of the Subscription.The 7-day cancellation period will not reset if you change subscription tiers or cancel and then resubscribe, as you have already had an opportunity to test the Services.Subscription fees. You will pay the fees, either to us or to the App Distributor, for the Initial Term and each subsequent Renewal Term up front, at the start of that Initial Term or Renewal Term, as applicable. We have the right to make changes to the fees applicable to your Subscription from time to time, although we will not make any change to the fees applicable to your Subscription during the current Initial Term or Renewal Term, as applicable. If these changes result in an increase in the fees payable by you, we will inform you at least 30 days in advance of the change. You agree to the increase in fees payable by you unless you cancel the Subscription, as described in the paragraph (Subscription cancellation) immediately above, before the Renewal Term to which the increase in fees will apply.7.

We do not control or accept responsibility for any loss or damage that may arise from your use of any Third-Party Content, services, and integrations, for which we make no representations or warranties.

General termsChanges to the Services. Our Services are novel and will change.

Although we will strive to provide you with reasonable advance notice if we stop offering a Service, there may be urgent situations—such as preventing abuse, responding to legal requirements, or addressing security and operability issues—where providing advance notice is not feasible. We will not be liable for any change to or any suspension or discontinuation of the Services or your access to them.Changes to these terms. We may revise and update these Terms at our discretion. Some examples of times, we may update these Terms include (1) to reflect changes in our Services, like when we add or remove features or services, or update our pricing, (2) for security or legal reasons, or (3) to promote safety or prevent abuse. If you continue to access the Services after we post the updated Terms on Anthropic’s website or otherwise give you notice of Terms changes, then you agree to the updated Terms. If you do not accept the updated Terms, you must stop using our Services.Supplemental terms. We may offer Services or features that we believe require service-specific terms or guidelines. When using our Services, you agree to comply with any applicable guidelines, rules, or supplemental terms that may be posted on the Services from time to time (“Supplemental Terms”).

In addition, if you have a Subscription, we may terminate the Subscription at any time for any other reason. If we exercise this right and you purchased the subscription via our website, we will refund you, on a pro rata basis, the fees you paid for the remaining portion of your Subscription after termination. Any refunds for Subscriptions purchased via an App Distributor are subject to the App Distributor’s terms and not these terms.We may also terminate your Account if you have been inactive for over a year and you do not have a paid Account. If we terminate your Account due to inactivity, we will provide you with notice before doing so.Upon termination of these Terms, a Subscription, or your access to the Services, we may at our option delete any Materials or other data associated with your Account. Sections 6 (with respect to fees outstanding as of such expiration or termination) and 9 – 12 will survive any expiration or termination of our Terms or a Subscription.Severability. If a particular Term or portion of these Terms is not valid or enforceable, this will have no effect on any other Terms.No waiver. Any delay or failure on our part to enforce a provision of these Terms is not a waiver of our right to enforce them later.No assignment. These Terms may not be transferred or assigned by you without our prior written consent, but may be assigned by us without restriction.Use of our brand. You may not, without our prior written permission, use our name, logos, or other trademarks in connection with products or services other than the Services, or in any other way that implies our affiliation, endorsement, or sponsorship.
