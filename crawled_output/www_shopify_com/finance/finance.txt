Shopify Credit and Shopify Balance Visa® Commercial Credit cards are powered by Stripe and issued by Celtic Bank pursuant to a license from Visa U.S.A. Inc. All funding through Shopify Capital in the U.S. is issued by WebBank.1.Shopify Payments payouts are typically deposited into your Shopify Balance account within 1-3 business days, and no later than 5 business days. Payouts sent to an external bank account usually take over a week longer to process.2.Shopify provides a reward in the form of an annual percentage yield (APY) on the money you hold in Shopify Balance and it is not interest. The rate is variable, subject to change without notice, and accurate as of September 18, 2025. The reward accrues daily, and is compounded and paid monthly in the form of a credit to your Balance account.3."Cashback" refers to rewards earned as a percentage discount on eligible purchases. Earn 3% cashback as a statement credit on up to US$100,000 of annual eligible purchases in your monthly top spend category—either marketing, fulfillment, or wholesale, and 1% cashback thereafter. Earn 1% cashback on the other two spend categories. Restrictions apply. See Rewards Program Terms for details.4.Shopify Credit is a pay-in-full card. By default, you are opted in to paying your full statement balance by an automatic debit from your designated bank account within 1 month to avoid fees. You have the option to switch to making daily payments from your sales and take up to 10 months to pay your full statement balance, for a fee. If payment is not received in full within 10 months, a 2% monthly late fee will apply to your past-due balance.5.Shopify Balance has no monthly, transfer, or hidden fees. Shopify doesn’t charge any ATM withdrawal fees, but you may be charged by an ATM provider.6.Shopify Capital is available in select countries. All loans through Shopify Capital are issued by WebBank in the United States. Offers to apply do not guarantee funding. Shopify Capital loans are repaid based on a percentage of daily sales. The maximum repayment term is 18 months, and 2 minimum payments apply. The actual time period within which the loan is repaid may be less than 18 months.ShopifyAboutCareersInvestorsPress and MediaPartnersAffiliatesLegalService statusSupportMerchant SupportShopify Help CenterHire a PartnerShopify AcademyShopify CommunityDevelopersShopify.devAPI DocumentationDev DegreeProductsShopShop PayShopify PlusShopify Fulfillment NetworkShopify for EnterpriseGlobal ImpactSustainabilityBuild BlackAccessibilityResearchSolutionsOnline Store BuilderWebsite BuilderEcommerce WebsiteUSA | EnglishUSAEnglishUSA | EnglishChoose a region & languageUSAEnglishTerms of servicePrivacy policySitemapPrivacy Choices
