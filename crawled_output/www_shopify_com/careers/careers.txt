We reject the status quo. We experiment, observe, and iterate â€” at high speeds with high rates of improvement â€” to make entrepreneurship a glorious thing.Moving fast to Get Shit Done requires resilience to uncertainty. Growth isnâ€™t just an opportunity here, itâ€™s an expectation. If you prefer a prescriptive corporate structure and an in-person office environment, Shopify isnâ€™t for you. If youâ€™re an independent thinker with a hunger for challenge and craft mastery, welcome to the endless pursuit of whatâ€™s ahead.Everyone here wants to be the worldâ€™s best at what they do. Some people who join us are already world-class: technical founders, innovators and patent holders, StarCraft champions. If this is you, hit skip the line for the fast track.Let's goSkip the lineMakecommercebetterforeveryone.What we doLife-defining work for youâ€”and entrepreneurs Opportunity is not evenly distributed. Shopify puts independence within reach for anyone with a dream to start a business. We propel entrepreneurs and enterprises to scale the heights of their potential.
Since 2006, weâ€™ve grown to ~8,000 employees and generated over $1 trillion in sales for millions of merchants in 175 countries. The ripple effect of this is far-reaching.

We use it to cast a vote with every product we buy. You need to care deeply about your work towards our mission to make commerce better for everyone not just those you agree with.Thrive on changeWeâ€™re building products for the long-term to make Shopify a forever company, and that requires an unrelenting pace (the week, not the quarter) and an ability to thrive in an unpredictable environment.
