Frequently asked questions
What is Burst?
Burst is a free stock photo platform that is powered by Shopify. Our image library
includes thousands of high-resolution, royalty-free images that were shot by
our global community of photographers. We built Burst to provide designers, developers,
bloggers and entrepreneurs with access to beautiful free stock photography.
You can use our pictures for just about anything — your website, blog or online store,
school projects, Instagram ads, facebook posts, desktop backgrounds, client work and
more. All our photos are free for commercial use with no attribution required; you
can read more about this on our license page.
How do I download free photos?
When you hover over or click on an image, you will see "High Resolution" and "Low Resolution" download options.
"Low Res" images are great for small web graphics, where file sizes need to be very compressed.
"High Res" images are better for presentations, websites, online stores, and anywhere else where
quality matters most.
Can I edit, crop or resize Burst photos?
Yes, you’re welcome to crop, resize, add text and filters, or otherwise modify our stock photos as you see fit.
If you don’t have Photoshop, there are lots of free or low cost online graphics editors
that you can use instead. Feel free to add your logo or brand to our images to make them your own.
Can I use these pictures for another online store platform?
Yes! We believe in making commerce better for everyone, so these stock
photos are free to use on any online store platform or ecommerce marketplace. Although they
were specifically created and curated with Shopify stores in mind, it’s
really up to you how you want to use them.
Do I need to credit the site or photographer?
Our photographers appreciate getting credit for their work because it helps share their photography with more
people, so we’d encourage you to do so whenever possible. You can give credit by linking back to the original
photo page or the photographer's Burst profile (e.g. “Photo by Matthew Henry from Burst”). We realize it's not
always possible to provide attribution, so it is not mandatory under our image license.
Are these photos free for commercial use?
Yes! In fact, we’d highly encourage it, as many of our collections were
created with entrepreneurs in mind. You can use these free photos on your
online store, product packaging, or anywhere else you’d like. You can
even use these pics to create t-shirts, mugs, or other products.
Can I use these photographs for offline marketing campaigns?
Of course. We’d be honored to have you feature our free stock photos on
a billboard, flyer, menu or catalog.
