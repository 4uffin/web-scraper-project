Free-spirited Lulu (Melanie Griffith) sets her sights on uptight banker Charles (Jeff Daniels) for a little bit of fun. Their relationship starts off simple enough with a tryst and some modest adventure, but Lulu wants Charles to pose as her husband at a high school reunion. It seems harmless enough to Charles, but that all changes when Lulu's actual husband, Ray (Ray Liotta), confronts them at the event. Understandably, Ray isn't content to let Charles and Lulu ride off into the sunset.

Something Wild
What to Know
Critics Consensus
Boasting loads of quirky charm, a pair of likable leads, and confident direction from Jonathan Demme, Something Wild navigates its unpredictable tonal twists with room to spare.

Neil Jillett
The Age (Australia)
Whether the two halves of Something Wild -- the offbeat romp and the horrifying wallow -- fit successfully in the same film is debatable... But, viewed on their individual merits, both halves are brilliantly crafted.

Sydney Morning Herald
Something Wild is based more on first principles than anything new, but it applies them with such vigour that the movie has a sense of limitless freedom. It tastes like free-range chicken, rather than battery-produced.

Pauline Kael
The New Yorker
Something Wild is rough-edged. It doesn’t have the grace of Demme’s Citizens Band and Melvin and Howard or the heightened simplicity of his Stop Making Sense. It has something else, though -- a freedom that takes off from the genre framework.

'Something Wild' plays like a screwball Hitchcock film reworked for the freewheeling eighties indie culture. It’s playful and colorful but doesn’t shy away from the darkness at the end of the road.

Something Wild is fun, at first. Then it becomes deadly and weird and engrossing. Predictable it is not.
Rated: 3/4

Buy a ticket to this whirligig of a movie at your own risk. You enter a fun house and exit through a chamber of horrors. But director Jonathan Demme provides a heck of a ride.

Another great '80s movie! Ray Liotta was a nice guy by all accounts, but he always played a bad guy so well you hated him!

Filme bacana para bacaninha, o roteiro é bacaninha, as cenas são bacanas, a história é bacaninha, o elenco é bacaninha, e alguns ajudam a melhorar o filme, os personagens são fracos, com tudo isso, eu recomendo esse filme

To like this movie you have to like Melanie Griffith. Personally it's one of my favorite films because it doesn't shy away from adult themes.

80s garbage. Amusing that's it's mostly regarded as an overlooked 80s gem. Everything feels intrinsically unnatural in this film. But hey, that's the 80s for you. As long as you can vibe to it's insipid cultural wares (which should be easier now for everyone since the 80s bizarrely went "classic"), you'll fall head over heels for this tone deaf vapid mess. I'd rather take some bad acid and drink a pail of white paint while trying to shave a pug with a lady shaver, than subject myself to this superficial, disposable crap again. Cheers Chip!

Fun enough to watch once, but sort of felt like the script was written by a committee doing a round robin.
