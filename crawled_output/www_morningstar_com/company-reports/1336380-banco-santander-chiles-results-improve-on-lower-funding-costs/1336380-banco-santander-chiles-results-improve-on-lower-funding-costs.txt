Banco Santander Chile: Increasing Our Fair Value Estimate on Higher Net Interest Margins
Michael Miller
Sep 19, 2025
Business Strategy and Outlook Banco Santander Chile is the largest bank by assets in the Chilean market. This scale has afforded the bank the second-cheapest deposit base in the country, significantly contributing to Santander Chile’s impressive returns on equity, which are typically in the upper teens. The bank has benefited from the introduction of the Superdigital and Santander Life accounts that are part of a larger trend toward increased adoption of digital banking in Chile. The bank’s digital offerings are tailored to reach an estimated population of 4.5 million unbanked Chilean citizens and have allowed the firm to trim the size of its branch network.

Transparency is how we protect the integrity of our work and keep empowering investors to achieve their goals and dreams.
And we have unwavering standards for how we keep that integrity intact, from our research and data to our policies on
content and your personal data.
We’d like to share more about how we work and what drives our day-to-day business.
How we make money
We sell different types of products and services to both investment professionals and individual investors.
These products and services are usually sold through license agreements or subscriptions. Our investment management
business generates asset-based fees, which are calculated as a percentage of assets under management.
We also sell both admissions and sponsorship packages for our investment conferences and advertising on our websites
and newsletters.
How we use your personal data
How we use your information depends on the product and service that you use and your relationship with us. We may use it to:
Verify your identity, personalize the content you receive, or create and administer your account. Provide specific products and services to you, such as portfolio management or data aggregation. Develop and improve features of our offerings. Gear advertisements and other marketing efforts towards your interests.
To learn more about how we handle and protect your data, visit our privacy center.
How we approach editorial content
Maintaining independence and editorial freedom is essential to our mission of empowering investor success.
We provide a platform for our authors to report on investments fairly, accurately, and from the investor’s point of view.
We also respect individual opinions––they represent the unvarnished thinking of our people and exacting analysis of our
research processes. Our authors can publish views that we may or may not agree with, but they show their work,
distinguish facts from opinions, and make sure their analysis is clear and in no way misleading or deceptive.
To further protect the integrity of our editorial content, we keep a strict separation between our sales teams and authors to remove any pressure or influence on our analyses and research.

editorial policy to learn more about our process.
