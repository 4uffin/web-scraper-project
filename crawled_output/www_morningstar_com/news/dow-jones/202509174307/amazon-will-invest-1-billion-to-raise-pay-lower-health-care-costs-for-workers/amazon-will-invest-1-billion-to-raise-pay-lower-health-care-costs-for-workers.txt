Amazon will raise wages and lower health care costs for U.S. fulfillment and transportation employees this fall as part of a $1 billion commitment to its workers.
The company said Wednesday that average pay will increase to more than $23 an hour this year, or more than $30 an hour including benefits.
Amazon didn't detail the raises but offered that some of its "most tenured employees" will receive up to an additional $1.90 per hour, while full-time employees will on average receive an additional $1,600 per year.
The company additionally has a step plan, meaning that the longer workers stay with the company, the more their pay increases year over year. It is adjusting the plan this year so that the pay increases are larger, according to the company.
After receiving feedback from its workers, Amazon said it will also update its entry-level health care plan. Starting next year the company
will lower its basic plan's cost to $5 per week and $5 for copays, reducing weekly contributions by 34% and copays by 87% for primary care, mental health and most non-specialist visits, it said.
