The European Union wants to suspend preferential tariff treatment on more than one-third of Israeli goods exported to the bloc and expand its sanctioning of officials in response to the crisis in Gaza.
Senior officials in the European Commission--the bloc's executive arm--said on Wednesday that they presented a package of measures to member states which would include additional tariffs on goods, putting support in areas like public administration on hold, sanctioning two Israeli ministers and bolstering measures against members of Hamas.
They said the measure would hit roughly 5.8 billion euros ($6.88 billion) of Israel's exports to the bloc and result in an estimated additional 227 million euros of duties to be paid per year.
EU imports from Israel were worth 15.9 billion euros last year, the commission said in a press release Wednesday, led by machinery and transport equipment and chemicals.
The EU said it wants to suspend trade elements of an agreement with Israel that dates back to the 1990s, which would mean that exports from the country would be subject to the Most Favoured Nation rates under World Trade Organization rules.
Tariffs would increase on roughly 37% of Israeli exports, officials said, and would apply to goods like fruit and rubber products. The proposal does not mean the commission is barring trade with Israel and it won't affect areas like capital movement or customs, they said.
The trade aspect of the plan would need to be approved by a qualified majority of the EU's member states, according to the commission.
The announcement comes after commission President Ursula von der Leyen said earlier this month that the commission would start suspending trade ties with Israel as pressure has increased on the EU to take a harder line on Gaza.
"The horrific events taking place in Gaza on a daily basis must stop," von der Leyen said in a statement Wednesday. "There needs to be an immediate ceasefire, unrestrained access for all humanitarian aid, and the release of all hostages held by Hamas," she said.
"Steps against Israel will be answered accordingly, and we hope we will not be required to take them," Gideon Sa'ar, Israel's foreign affairs minister, said in response to von der Leyen's comments.
