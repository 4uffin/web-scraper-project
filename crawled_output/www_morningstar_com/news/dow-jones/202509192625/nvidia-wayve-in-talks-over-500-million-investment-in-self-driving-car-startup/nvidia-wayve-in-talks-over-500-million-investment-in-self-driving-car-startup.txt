Nvidia is holding discussions with Wayve Technologies over a potential $500 million investment in the self-driving car startup, a move that could further expand their collaboration in autonomous vehicles.
The companies signed a letter of intent to evaluate the funding which, if it materializes, would come as part of Wayve's next funding round, further cementing a partnership that dates back to 2018.
London-based Wayve has bet on Nvidia technology to power its artificial-intelligence models. Its AI training and fleet-learning infrastructure is built on Microsoft Azure, which relies on Nvidia hardware.
The startup develops software known as Embodied AI that allows cars to interact with, comprehend and learn from human behavior in real-world environments, effectively equipping vehicles with a robot brain that can adapt to unexpected situations.
The company said its upcoming platform would be built on Nvidia's Drive AGX Thor, a kit for the design, testing and deployment of autonomous vehicles that is used by the likes of China's BYD, Xiaomi and Sweden's Volvo Car, according to Nvidia.
Nvidia has already invested in Wayve, which last year raised $1.05 billion from investors such as Japan's SoftBank Group, Microsoft and Nvidia itself.
Alex Kendall, Wayve's co-founder and chief executive, said continued support from a giant like Nvidia underscores confidence in its tech.
In June, Uber Technologies and Wayve agreed to launch public-road trials of fully autonomous vehicles in London once all permits and approvals from local authorities are in place.
The companies said at the time they had picked the U.K. capital because of its significantly different road layouts and traffic laws compared with U.S. locations, where most testing had been conducted. A more complex driving environment would allow the companies to better develop the technology needed to deploy self-driving cars at scale.
