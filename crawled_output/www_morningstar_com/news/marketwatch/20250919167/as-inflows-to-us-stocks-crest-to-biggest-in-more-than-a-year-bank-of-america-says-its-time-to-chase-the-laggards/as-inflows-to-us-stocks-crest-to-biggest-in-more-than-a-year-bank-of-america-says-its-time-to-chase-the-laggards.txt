One sector is vulnerable as inflationary pressures, build say strategists
It's time to "chase the laggards," that have not been participating in the stock rally, say Bank of America strategists.
As investors poured money into U.S. stocks in the week leading up to the Fed meeting, Bank of America Global Research is telling its clients that it's "time to chase the laggards" of the equity rally.
In the week ending Sept. 17, the day of the Fed Reserve's decision to cut interest rates by 25 basis points, investors poured $57.7 billion into U.S. stocks - the biggest amount since Dec. 2024 - strategists led by Michael Hartnett told clients in a note on Friday.
This year, those inflows have totaled $294 billion, making for the third-highest inflow year on record. The strategists said just $14.3 billion flowed into bonds, the smallest inflow in three months.
Hartnett and his team said a "run-it-hot" policy from the U.S. administration - with cuts on tariffs, taxes and now interest rates - is an "implicit guarantee economy & stocks 'too big to fail.'" They noted the massive jump in U.S. mortgage refinancing rates this week - Bank of America said it's the biggest since March 2020 - is a sign the Fed is cutting rates into an economic acceleration.
In their opinion, bond yields have peaked and the best equity trade for a combination of rising growth and falling yields is "long unloved bond sensitives," such as small-cap stocks, real-estate investment trusts (REITs), biotech."
Thursday saw the small-cap focused Russell-2000 RUT log its first record close in four years, versus the 26th record for the S&P 500 SPX. The Vanguard Real Estate ETF VNQ has barely budged this year, while Novo Nordisk (NVO) is one high-profile biotech stock that has dropped 28% drop this year, as the Ozempic drugmaker faces competition from rivals.
Hartnett and his team also offered some caution for investors, noting, "asset price inflation begets consumer price inflation," meaning rising prices of assets such as stocks could eventually cause prices of goods and services to rise. They shared a chart showing U.S. equity wealth has climbed $6 trillion this year.
In another chart, they showed disapproval of how President Donald Trump is handling inflation, which is nearing highs this year. A "second wave of inflation [is] politically very risky before '26 midterms," said Hartnett and his colleagues.
The strategists said they expect "government intervention to control prices in sectors that 'whip inflation'" will continue, warning that if electricity bills start to surge, big utilities will be the "next most vulnerable sector."
Electricity costs have been rising this year, and while President Trump has blamed renewables, others say higher demand, climate-change-induced weather events and demand from cloud-computing and AI companies for data centers.
For some investors, the AI demand has made utilities an attractive sector to put money.
Global stocks also saw the biggest inflows since December 2024, while in contrast, just $14.3 billion flowed into bonds, the smallest inflow in three months, and cash saw the first outflow in seven weeks, of $4.8 billion.
