Nvidia's stock falls on China fears. How much should investors worry?
Nvidia's stock falls on China fears. How much should investors worry?

Some analysts view China's reported move to ban sales of Nvidia's RTX Pro 6000D as 'political theater' and 'posturing' in light of trade talks with the U.S.
Nvidia co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang introduced Nvidia's RTX Pro server at Computex in Taiwan earlier this year.
Nvidia Corp. shares fell Wednesday, reflecting investor concerns over a report saying that China had banned technology companies in the country from buying the company's artificial-intelligence chips.
Beijing's internet regulator, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), told large tech companies such as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (BABA) and ByteDance Ltd. that they should not use Nvidia's (NVDA) RTX Pro 6000D chip, the component specifically designed for sale in the world's second-biggest economy, according to the Financial Times, which cited three sources.
It's the latest twist in Nvidia's attempt to get back to business in China. The move comes as Beijing tries to bolster the domestic AI sector and follows earlier reports that Chinese officials had sought to dissuade the country's tech companies from using Nvidia's H20 AI chip. Meanwhile, Beijing and Washington are continuing dialogue over reaching a trade deal.
"We can only be in service of a market if a country wants us to be," Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said later at a press conference in London. "I'm disappointed with what I see, but they have larger agendas to work out between China and the United States. And I'm patient about it. We'll continue to be supportive of the Chinese government and Chinese companies as they wish," he added.
Some analysts thought the ban could just be a leveraging tool against the U.S. given the trade negotiations with China. Mizuho desk-based analyst Jordan Klein wrote in a note on Wednesday that the move supports his earlier view that "China actions are pure posturing and noise," rather than something that should convince investors to change their investments in Nvidia.
"You should just tune this China newsflow out and focus on non-China demand and [revenue] growth potential for [Nvidia] that could not be any better," Klein said.
Daniel Newman, chief executive of The Futurum Group, shared similar sentiments on X where he said news around Nvidia's China business "increasingly looks and feels like political theater."
To the public, "China has to appear nationalistic and focused on developing its own AI chips and infrastructure," Newman said on X. However, China's homemade chips and software systems are lagging "far behind" in his view, and the country will face setbacks from relying on local companies.
"We believe Nvidia is critical to China's AI ambitions," Newman said.
Gil Luria, head of technology research at D.A. Davidson, told MarketWatch that, while the RTX series that is being banned "itself is not important for Nvidia sales," his team believes Nvidia will continue having a hard time selling its H20 chips. It could get to the point where Nvidia can't sell a version of its Blackwell AI platform in the country "at all," Luria said in emailed comments.
"If these restrictions persist, expectations for Nvidia may prove to be too high," Luria said.
Nvidia's stock fell 2.6% on Wednesday.
Concerns that Nvidia will face increased competition in the AI-chip sector have sent its shares down 5.7% over the past month, against a 2.3% rise for the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index COMP over that span.
Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (HK:9988) (BABA) revealed on Wednesday it had signed a contract with China Unicom to provide the country's No. 2 wireless carrier with its new AI chips, according to Bloomberg. Alibaba's U.S.-listed shares rose 2.4% to their highest in nearly four years as China's tech sector hit its best level since 2021.
