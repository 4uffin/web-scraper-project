CarMax Offers Consumers the Most Flexible Way to Buy a Used Vehicle
David Whiston Jun 20, 2025
CarMax's revenue has increased at a compound annual rate of 10.8% since fiscal 2000 because of the success of customer-friendly sales practices and use of information technology. We think the firm will eventually reach its over 5% zero to 10-year-old vehicle market share target, up from 3.7% in calendar 2023 and 2024. Revenue of at least $33 billion should come before reaching another goal of selling a combined 2 million annual retail and auction units.

Bulls Say, Bears Say
Bulls CarMax has increased revenue and profitability at a remarkable rate, and we think it is positioned to gain market share in any environment. Omnichannel helps this story, as it lets consumer have maximum flexibility in their experience.
Bears CarMax operates in a cyclical industry, and its strong model is not immune to a recession. Tariffs are not a direct threat but they will likely mean higher used vehicle prices and squeeze consumers' ability to buy a used vehicle.

Company Profile
CarMax sells, finances, and services used and new cars through a chain of around 250 used retail stores. It was formed in 1993 as a unit of Circuit City and spun off into an independent company in late 2002. Used-vehicle sales were 83% of fiscal 2025 revenue and wholesale about 17%, with the remaining portion composed of extended service plans and repair. In fiscal 2025, the company retailed and wholesaled 789,050 and 544,312 used vehicles, respectively. CarMax is the largest used-vehicle retailer in the US but still estimates that it had only about 3.7% US market share of vehicles 0-10 years old in calendar 2024. It seeks over 5% share. CarMax is based in Richmond, Virginia.
