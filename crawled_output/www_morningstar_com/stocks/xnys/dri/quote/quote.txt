Darden's Smart Marketing and Promotions Keep Consumers Engaged, Supporting Same-Store Sales Growth
Jaime M Katz, Aidan Kernell Sep 24, 2025
Darden Restaurants’ strategy is centered around cost efficiency, data-driven decision-making, and elevating the employee experience, which help create a unique dining experience that uplifts the brand. We view this strategy as promising and believe Darden will succeed despite industry trends, which include a higher preference for takeout and delivery over dining in at restaurants in recent periods.

Bulls Say, Bears Say
Bulls Darden's strong restaurant margin recovery should defend its 2%-3% annual unit growth targets even as pressure builds elsewhere in the full-service restaurant industry.
Bears Slower full-service industry growth could result in aggressive discounting and challenges generating positive traffic in the intermediate term.

Company Profile
Darden Restaurants is the largest restaurant operator in the US full-service space, with consolidated revenue of $12.1 billion in fiscal 2025. The company maintains a portfolio of 11 restaurant brands: Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse, Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen, Ruth's Chris, Yard House, The Capital Grille, Seasons 52, Eddie V’s, Bahama Breeze, The Capital Burger, and most recently, Chuy's. Darden generates revenue almost exclusively from company-owned restaurants, though a small network of franchised restaurants and consumer-packaged goods sales contribute modestly through the traditional grocery channel. As of the end of its fiscal 2025, the company operated 2,159 restaurants in the US.

Transparency is how we protect the integrity of our work and keep empowering investors to achieve their goals and dreams.
And we have unwavering standards for how we keep that integrity intact, from our research and data to our policies on
content and your personal data.
We’d like to share more about how we work and what drives our day-to-day business.
How we make money
We sell different types of products and services to both investment professionals and individual investors.
These products and services are usually sold through license agreements or subscriptions. Our investment management
business generates asset-based fees, which are calculated as a percentage of assets under management.
We also sell both admissions and sponsorship packages for our investment conferences and advertising on our websites
and newsletters.
How we use your personal data
How we use your information depends on the product and service that you use and your relationship with us. We may use it to:
Verify your identity, personalize the content you receive, or create and administer your account. Provide specific products and services to you, such as portfolio management or data aggregation. Develop and improve features of our offerings. Gear advertisements and other marketing efforts towards your interests.

How we approach editorial content
Maintaining independence and editorial freedom is essential to our mission of empowering investor success.
We provide a platform for our authors to report on investments fairly, accurately, and from the investor’s point of view.
We also respect individual opinions––they represent the unvarnished thinking of our people and exacting analysis of our
research processes. Our authors can publish views that we may or may not agree with, but they show their work,
distinguish facts from opinions, and make sure their analysis is clear and in no way misleading or deceptive.
To further protect the integrity of our editorial content, we keep a strict separation between our sales teams and authors to remove any pressure or influence on our analyses and research.

editorial policy to learn more about our process.
