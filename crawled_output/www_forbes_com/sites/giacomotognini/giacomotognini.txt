He joined Forbes in 2019 and lives in New York. He’s investigated the hidden offshore wealth of Russian oligarchs, billions of dollars in assets held offshore by a member of the Adani family and the Adani Group, and the maze of corporate structures and secretive inner circle of crypto giant Binance. His reporting has also led him to a Dayton, Ohio-based real estate investor with the best returns in the country and a fighter-jet-flying payments entrepreneur in New Jersey. Tognini’s work has been cited in U.S. Department of Justice seizure warrants, U.S. congressional letters and in Indian Supreme Court filings, and he was a part of the Russian Asset Tracker project that won the 2023 European Press Prize for innovation and the Dubai Unlocked project that won the 2024 SABEW Best in Business Award for data journalism - medium division. Tognini graduated with a double major in political science and political economy from the University of California, Berkeley and a master's in journalism from Columbia University. Follow Tognini for continued coverage of billionaires and investigations into offshore wealth.
