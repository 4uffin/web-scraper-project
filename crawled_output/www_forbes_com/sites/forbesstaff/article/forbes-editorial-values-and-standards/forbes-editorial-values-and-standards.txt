Forbes magazine was founded by B.C. Forbes in 1917. Nearly 80 years later, in 1996, we launched our first online platform, Forbes.com. The Forbes Contributor Network was formed in 2010, and in 2019 we started our Breaking News desk. Today each one plays an interdependent role in reaching our audience on- and off-site, including social media, videos, newsletters, virtual and live programs and much more.
One constant is our highest standards for quality and trustworthy journalism.
As an international publisher and publishing platform, we are committed to premium journalism, analysis and thought leadership. Forbes staff editorial and newsroom teams and contributor network are built on the following core principles:
· Independence & Integrity
· Fair & Ethical Journalism
· Freedom from Bias & Conflicts of Interest
· Factual & Authoritative Reporting and Analysis
· Inclusive & Diverse Voices
We honor the Society of Professional Journalists’ Code of Ethics.
Our Journalism
Quality, expert and trustworthy journalism is fundamental to our entire business. Our award-winning coverage is centered around:
·
Wealth & Billionaires
· Finance & Investing
· Entrepreneurship & Founders
· Technology & Innovation
· Leadership & Professional Communities
· Consumer Businesses
· Lifestyle
Our Safeguards
We take facts seriously, making clear updates when corrections are warranted and fact-checking major and investigative stories by a team of trained staff journalists. All work published on Forbes must steer clear of hate speech, unnecessarily sensational content, distortion, exaggeration, bias, carelessness, half-truths and deceit.
We prohibit all staff members and contributors from accepting compensation, privileges or favors of any kind from people, companies or groups featured in their coverage. Any real or perceived conflicts of interest or relationships at all (financial, professional, legal actions, personal or otherwise) must be avoided and/or discussed with the appropriate managing editor. If approved, it must be explicitly disclosed in the story to readers to maintain their trust
Any attempt to evade or failure to honor these solemn responsibilities is a serious offense and is subject to review and swift disciplinary action, including removal from the platform.
Forbes journalists and contributors may use approved artificial intelligence (AI) platforms and tools for research, data analysis and efficiency. To the extent we use AI tools to create content and assist in content creation or curation, we clearly disclose how and when AI was used to ensure our work is accurate and deserving our readers' trust and attention.
Our Affiliate, Branded, Partner & Sponsored Content
Forbes offers staff product reviews and is aligned with a variety of partners and sponsors through affiliate and branded content, products and platforms, events and research. We also have 47 international editions, including Forbes Africa, Forbes Asia and Forbes Middle East.
