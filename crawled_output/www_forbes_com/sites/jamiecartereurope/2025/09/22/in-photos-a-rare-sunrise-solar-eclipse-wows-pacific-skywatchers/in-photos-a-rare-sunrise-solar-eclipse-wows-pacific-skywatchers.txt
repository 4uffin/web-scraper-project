A deep partial solar eclipse covered up to 86% of the sun as seen from southern New Zealand and Antarctica, creating a dramatic partial eclipse in a year without a total solar eclipse.People watch a partial solar eclipse at New Brighton, a coastal suburb of Christchurch, on September 22, 2025. A solar eclipse occurs when the moon passes between Earth and the sun, casting a shadow on our planet. The sun appeared as a crescent due to this partial eclipse. In New Zealand, coverage ranges were about 60% in the north island and more than 70% in the south island. This solar eclipse was visible to parts of the Pacific, Atlantic, Australia and Antarctica.

In southern New Zealand and Antarctica’s Ross Sea, up to 86% of the sun was obscured, creating a dramatic crescent sunrise.The eclipse was streamed live from Dunedin in New Zealand’s South Island, where the sun rose already eclipsed and reached 70% obscuration. In 2026, there are solar eclipses in February and August, with the latter on Aug. 12 a total solar eclipse visible deom Greenland, Iceland and Spain.View of a partial solar eclipse at New Brighton, a coastal suburb of Christchurch, on September 22, 2025.

Antarctica’s remote stations, including McMurdo and Zucchelli Stations, experienced even deeper views. Across the Pacific, from Fiji to Tonga, smaller partial eclipses were recorded, while Tahiti saw a subtle but beautiful 8% coverage after sunrise. Tasmania, Australia, saw a barely noticeable 3% partial solar eclipse. People watch a partial solar eclipse at New Brighton, a coastal suburb of Christchurch, on September 22, 2025.

The geometry of the equinox —when Earth’s tilted axis is side-on to the sun — can mean an increase in the frequency and the intensity of the geomagnetic storms that cause displays of aurora.View of a partial solar eclipse at New Brighton, a coastal suburb of Christchurch, on September 22, 2025.

For example, Dunedin is in the path of totality during a total solar eclipse on July 22, 2028, when it will experience 2 minutes 47 seconds of totality close to sunset. The path of totality that day will stretch 7,442 miles (11,976 kilometers), crossing the Cocos and Christmas Islands, parts of Western Australia, Northern Territory, Queensland and New South Wales in Australia, and New Zealand’s South Island.
