Of The Moon, Venus And A Bright Star On FridayByJamie Carter,Senior Contributor.Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. An award-winning reporter writing about stargazing and the night sky.Follow AuthorSep 18, 2025, 02:00am EDTShareSaveCommentAdd Us On GoogleToplineSkywatchers will be treated to one of the year’s most spectacular astronomical sights on the morning of Friday, Sept. 19, 2025, during a rare conjunction of the moon, Venus and bright star Regulus. The three celestial bodies will appear to be within a degree of each other, forming an almost perfect straight-line alignment for some and a tight triangle for others, depending on location.Sky chart showing a conjunction between the Moon, Venus, and Regulus in the eastern sky before sunrise on September 19, 2025.NASA/JPL-CaltechKey FactsThe three objects will look at their best about 90 minutes before sunrise across North America on the morning of Friday, Sept. 19, 2025. Look low in the east-northeast before dawn. A waning crescent moon, just 6%-lit, will be a spectacular sight in itself, either to the naked eye or through binoculars. About a quarter of a degree below the crescent moon, Venus will shine about 100 times brighter than Regulus, the brightest star in the constellation Leo, just below it. The sight is set to be one of the closest and most visually striking moon-Venus pairings of the year. It will be a fleeting sight. By the following morning, Saturday, Sept. 20, 2025, the moon will have moved away from Venus and Regulus. Friday, Sept. 19: A crescent moon, Venus and Regulus in a very cloe conjunction. StellariumWhat The Conjunction Will Look Like From North AmericaWhat you will see from North America will depend on where you observe from. In the north and east of the U.S., there will be an almost perfect alignment of the moon, Venus and Regulus. To the south and west, Venus will appear a little higher, forming a triangle. However, none of the wow factor will be lost — this will be a very close conjunction easily visible to the naked eye from across North America. If you have binoculars, all three will fit in their field of view. Occultation Across Northern Canada And GreenlandAccording to In-The-Sky.org, the moon will occult Venus from some parts of the world. As seen from parts of Africa, Europe, western Russia, Canada, Greenland and Asia, the moon will cover Venus for a short period. Although only Far North Canada will see it, the rest of the country will see a spectacular close conjunction of the moon and Venus.
