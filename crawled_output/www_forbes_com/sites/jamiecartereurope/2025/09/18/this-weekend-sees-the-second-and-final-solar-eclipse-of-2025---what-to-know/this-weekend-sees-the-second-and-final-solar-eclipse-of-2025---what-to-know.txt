Partial Solar EclipseUnlike during a total solar eclipse, a partial solar eclipse sees only part of the sun's disk blocked by the moon. During a total solar eclipse, there’s a narrow path of totality projected onto Earth by the moon’s dark central shadow (its umbra). Locations inside the path of totality experience a total solar eclipse and those outside of it a partial solar eclipse. During a partial solar eclipse, the umbra misses Earth, with only the penumbra — the moon's outer, fuzzier and lighter shadow — striking Earth. When Is The Next Solar Eclipse?The next solar eclipse after Monday’s is an annular solar eclipse on Feb. 17, 2026. A form of partial solar eclipse, up to 92% of the sun will be blocked by a new moon, creating a “ring of fire” for 2 minutes and 20 seconds. It will only be seen from Antarctica and the Southern Ocean south of Australia. On Aug. 12, 2026, a total solar eclipse will see a path of totality pass across northern Russia, eastern Greenland, western Iceland and northern Spain. Totality will peak at 2 minutes 18 seconds off the coast of Iceland.
