If not, have a look now because it will soon disappear. This week’s main event in the parade is a very rare and spectacular meeting of Venus, a crescent moon and bright star Regulus on Friday, Sept. 19 — the closest such pairing until the 2040s. With Saturn reaching opposition on Sunday, Sept. 21, it’s one of the best weekends of 2025 so far for planet-spotting.September's planetary parade features five planets, three of them visible to the naked eye — and Saturn at opposition. Here’s when and where to look this weekend, Sept. 19-21, 2025.NASA, ESA, CSA, Matthew Tiscareno (SETI Institute), Matthew Hedman (University of Idaho), Maryame El Moutamid (Cornell University), Mark Showalter (SETI Institute), Leigh Fletcher (University of Leicester), Heidi Hammel (AURA) Image Processing Joseph DePasquale (STScI)Key FactsThis planet parade is best seen about an hour before sunrise, with Venus low in the east, Jupiter high in the east-southeast, and Saturn low in the west. Uranus and Neptune are also present, but require binoculars or a telescope to see.On Friday, Sept. 19, Venus, a 5%-lit waning crescent moon and bright star Regulus will cluster within just over a degree of sky. All three will be visible to the naked eye, and appear in the same field of view of binoculars.Saturday, Sept. 20, will see Venus and Regulus still close together, but the crescent moon will have moved away and be barely visible below. Look for subtle “Earthshine” on the moon's dark side — it’s sunlight reflected by oceans, clouds and ice.Saturn is now as good as it gets. It’s the planet’s annual opposition on Sunday, Sept. 21. On that date, it will rise at sunset, reach its highest around midnight and set at sunrise.The showpiece of the "planet parade" this week comes on Friday, Sept. 19, when a slender 6%-lit waning crescent moon, Venus and Regulus — the brightest star in the constellation Leo — align in just a degree of the sky before dawn.StellariumA Rare Trio Before DawnFriday’s moon-Venus-Regulus grouping is the tightest such conjunction until 2041. They'll be so close that skywatchers will be able to cover them all up with a thumb held at arm’s length against the sky, according to When The Curves Line Up. It’s a rare chance to see a planet, a star and the moon in one tiny patch of sky. As a bonus, the waning crescent moon will be around 6%-lit — one of its most spectacular and beautiful phases.

This weekend is when to look at it through any telescope, though its famous rings are tilted almost edge-on this year. On Monday, Sept. 22, skywatchers in New Zealand, Antarctica, and parts of the South Pacific will witness a very deep partial solar eclipse at sunrise. By chance, it almost coincides with the southward equinox, when the sun appears directly above the equator at midday on its apparent journey south.
