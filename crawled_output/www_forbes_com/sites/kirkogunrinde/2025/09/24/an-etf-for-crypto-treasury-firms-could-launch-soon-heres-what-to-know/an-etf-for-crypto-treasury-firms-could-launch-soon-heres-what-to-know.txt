The ETF would also allow private investments in public equity (PIPE) deals—deals that allow investors to purchase equity directly from a publicly traded company—according to the filing.While other ETFs offer crypto exposure, GSR's fund is the first to offer exposure to the select group of crypto treasury companies. The ETF is expected to launch pending regulatory approval by the Securities and Exchanges Commission, but a date has not been given.GSR trades crypto tokens and provides venture funding for over 300 companies, according to its website.What Is A Digital Asset Treasury Company?Digital Asset Treasury Companies are firms raising capital through various measures to fund and hold significant portions of cryptocurrencies on their balance sheets. MicroStrategy , a software enterprise company turned crypto treasury, was the first to adopt this tactic in 2020 with bitcoin and crypto companies like Upexi Inc, Sharplink Gaming, and Bitmine Immersion Technologies have followed. Crypto ETFs, similar to stock ETFs, allow investors to invest in cryptocurrencies without directly owning them. These funds are overseen by professional fund managers and are under regulatory guidance. Investments can be managed through traditional brokerage accounts, without investors having to manage digital wallets or secure storages. Firms including BlackRock, Fidelity and Grayscale manage crypto ETFs across tokens like bitcoin, Ether, and Solana.TangentThe crypto treasury trend gathered steam this year, as companies rushed to take advantage of a crypto spike amid bitcoin's all-time high in August. According to crypto tracker bitcointreasuries.net, the 194 bitcoin treasury companies hold more than $117 billion worth of the token.
