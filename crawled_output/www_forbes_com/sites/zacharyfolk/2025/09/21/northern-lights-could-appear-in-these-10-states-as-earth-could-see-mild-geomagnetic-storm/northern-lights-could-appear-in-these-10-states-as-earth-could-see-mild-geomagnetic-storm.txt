I cover breaking news.Follow AuthorSep 21, 2025, 04:04pm EDTShareSaveAdd Us On GoogleToplineThe northern lights could be visible across as many as 10 states on Sunday night, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s space weather forecast, as the effects of a geomagnetic storm could impact the aurora.The aurora borealis could be visible in the northern continental U.S. and Alaska.NurPhoto via Getty ImagesKey FactsForecasters at NOAA are predicting a Kp index of four out of nine on Sunday night, which means the lights could appear “brighter” and with more “auroral activity,” described as “motion and formations.”Earth could see the effects of a mild, G1-rated geomagnetic storm on Sunday night, according to NOAA’s forecast, when the Kp index is expected to spike to its highest level.The storm is likely due to coronal hole high speed streams, NOAA forecasters said—high speed solar winds that escape from “cooler, less dense” regions of the Sun.The view line for the northern lights on Sunday night.NOAAWhich States Could See The Aurora?The aurora might be visible in states along the U.S.-Canadian border, including northern Washington, the northern Idaho panhandle, most of Montana, North Dakota, and northern South Dakota.
