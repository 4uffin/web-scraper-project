I cover breaking news.Follow AuthorSep 16, 2025, 10:01am EDTSep 16, 2025, 01:33pm EDTShareSaveAdd Us On GoogleToplineA judge in New York dismissed the charges for first degree murder and second degree murder as a crime of terrorism against Luigi Mangione, the suspect accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in December, finding the charges “legally insufficient”—but allowed the other counts to remain, including intentional second degree murder.The man accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson will still face other charges on the indictment, including second degree murder.Getty ImagesKey FactsMangione, 27, was indicted on 11 New York State charges after his arrest in Altoona, Pennsylvania, over a week after Thompson’s murder, and will still face nine of those charges, including second degree murder and several weapons charges.Mangione pleaded not guilty to all charges in December, and his attorneys moved to dismiss the entire indictment earlier this year.Judge Gregory Carro only dismissed the charges of first degree and second degree murder charges related to terrorism—allowing the third charge of second degree murder to stand.Prosecutors “presented sufficient evidence that the defendant murdered Brian Thompson in a premeditated and calculated execution,” Carrow wrote, but added “that does not mean, however, that the defendant did so with terroristic intent.”Supporters for Mangione, who has become a popular symbol for Americans outraged by rising costs of the health insurance industry, gathered outside the courthouse in costumes bearing signs that read “Free Luigi,” “Healthcare is a human right” and “Not Guilty.”Why Were The Terrorism Charges Dropped?In his filing on Tuesday, Carro noted that terrorism was “famously difficult to define.” Under New York law, an act of terrorism can be defined as one designed to "intimidate or coerce a civilian population, influence the policy of a unit of government by intimidation or coercion, or affect the conduct of a unit of government by murder, assassination or kidnapping," Carro wrote. According to the judge, prosecutors claimed Mangione meant to influence a “unit of government” due to his use of a single phrase in the defendant’s writings: “revolutionary anarchism.” Carro dismissed this claim, writing “Not only does this stretch the import of a two-word phrase beyond what it can carry, but it ignores other, more explicit excerpts from defendant's writings in which he states that his goal is to spread a "message" and "win public support" about "everything wrong with our health system." Carro also found “there was no evidence presented that the defendant's conscious objective or intent was to intimidate or coerce the employees of United Healthcare.” Overall, Carro found that the writing in the journal instead stated an objective to “draw attention to what he perceived as the greed of the insurance industry” and “negatively affect the financials of the company.” Carro also noted that federal prosecutors did not charge Mangione with terrorism, “even though the federal terrorism statute served as a model for the state statute.”Supporters of Luigi Mangione unveil banners outside Manhattan Criminal Court, where Mangione's hearing took place.Getty ImagesA supporter holds a "Free Luigi' sign outside Manhattan Criminal Court.Getty ImagesA supporter wearing a "Free Luigi" shirt enters the courtroom before Mangione's hearing.Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.Key BackgroundThompson, 50, the CEO of UnitedHealthcare since 2021, was shot and killed on a sidewalk in Midtown Manhattan in what police called a “targeted attack” on December 4, 2024. Thompson’s suspected killer, who wore a mask, escaped on foot and an e-bike. Investigators released some photos of the suspected killer, but soon noted that they believed he already managed to flee the city. Over a week after the shooting, Mangione was arrested after he was recognized at a McDonalds in Pennsylvania from the images circulated by investigators. He was indicted on both federal and state charges that same month. He still faces federal charges, and Attorney General Pam Bondi instructed prosecutors to seek the death penalty for the suspected shooter in April.What To Watch ForCarro set Mangione’s next hearing for his state charges for December 1. His trial date has not been set.Got a tip? Share confidential information with Forbes.Editorial StandardsReprints & PermissionsLOADING VIDEO PLAYER...FORBES’ FEATURED Video© 2025 Forbes Media LLC.
