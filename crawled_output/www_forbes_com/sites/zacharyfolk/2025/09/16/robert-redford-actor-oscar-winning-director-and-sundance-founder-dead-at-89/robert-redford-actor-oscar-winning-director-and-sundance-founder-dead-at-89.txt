I cover breaking news.Follow AuthorSep 16, 2025, 08:53am EDTSep 16, 2025, 01:08pm EDTShareSaveAdd Us On GoogleToplineRobert Redford, the legendary Hollywood star famous for acting in dramatic roles in “All the President’s Men” and “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,” later director of award-winning films including “Ordinary People,” and founder of Sundance, died in his sleep early on Tuesday morning, his publicity firm told The New York Times.Redford died in his sleep on Tuesday, his publicity firm said.Getty ImagesKey FactsRedford’s publicity firm, Rogers & Cowan PMK, confirmed his death to the New York Times and other outlets Tuesday morning.Redford died early on Tuesday morning at his home in Utah, his publicist said in the statement, noting that the legendary actor was in “the place he loved, surrounded by those he loved.”The cause of his death was not disclosed.Key BackgroundRedford began his career as a theater and television actor in the 1960s, appearing in episodes of popular programs like “Alfred Hitchcock Presents,” “The Twilight Zone,” and “Perry Mason.” He landed his first role in a Hollywood film in the 1962 Korean War drama
“War Hunt,” alongside Sydney Pollock. Pollock would go on to direct Redford in seven of both men’s most well-known films, including “Jeremiah Johnson,” “Three Days of the Condor,” and “The Way We Were.” In 1969, he starred in George Roy Hill’s western “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,” alongside Paul Newman, launching his career as a leading man. He would work with Hill and Newman again in 1973’s “The Sting,” which took home seven Oscars that year including Best Picture. Redford made his directorial debut in 1980 with the Oscar-winning “Ordinary People,” a family drama starring Donald Sutherland and Mary Tyler Moore that won Best Picture and Best Director for Redford. He went on to direct 10 more films over the course of his career, including 1992’s “A River Runs Through It,” an adaptation of a Norman Maclean novella and 1994’s “Quiz Show,” dramatizing the quiz show fixing scandals of the 1950s. Redford also continued acting in Hollywood features until 2019, remaining a fixture in popular American films by portraying Alexander Pierce in the Marvel movies “Captain America: Winter Soldier” and “Avengers: Endgame.” Creation Of Sundance—an Independent Film Center That Launched Many CareersRedford founded the Sundance Institute in 1981, the nonprofit organization dedicated to fostering independent cinema that also runs the Sundance Film Festival. The Sundance Institute held the first modern festival in 1985, still under the name “US Film and Video Festival,” according to the Institute’s timeline, and was officially renamed the Sundance Film Festival in 1991. Sundance served as a launching pad for many of the emerging directors of the 1980s and 1990s, including Quentin Tarantino, Steven Soderbergh and Paul Thomas Anderson, all of whom saw early films screened at the Utah festival. In the years since, the festival became a hotspot for Hollywood distributors looking to acquire a new hit. The festival has since outgrown its home in the tiny resort town of Park City, Utah, and earlier this year, organizers announced the festival would take place in Boulder, Colorado starting in 2027.What Awards Did Redford Win?Aside from “Ordinary People,” “Quiz Show” was also nominated for both Best Director and Best Picture, (losing to Robert Zemeckis’s “Forrest Gump” in 1994). Despite his long career as an actor, Redford was only nominated for Best Actor once for his role in “The Sting,” the 1973 heist film that took home Best Picture that same year at the Oscars. He was given several honorary awards later in his career, including the Golden Globes Cecil B. DeMille Award in 1994, the Screen Actors Guild Lifetime Achievement Award in 1995, an Honorary Award from the Oscars in 2002.Got a tip?
