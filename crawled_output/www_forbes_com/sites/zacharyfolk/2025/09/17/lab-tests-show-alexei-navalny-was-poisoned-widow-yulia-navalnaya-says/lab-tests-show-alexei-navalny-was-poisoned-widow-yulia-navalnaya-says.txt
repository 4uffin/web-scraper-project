I cover breaking news.Follow AuthorSep 17, 2025, 09:23am EDTSep 17, 2025, 10:31am EDTShareSaveAdd Us On GoogleToplineYulia Navalnaya, the widow of deceased Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, said new evidence from two laboratory tests show that her husband was poisoned when he died at a penal colony in 2024—years after surviving a previous poisoning attempt from Soviet-era nerve agent Novichok.The Russian opposition leader died at a penal colony in 2024.AFP via Getty ImagesKey FactsNavalnaya said she obtained biological samples from Navalny after his death at the “Polar Wolf” penal colony in Russia’s Arctic Circle and was able to “securely transfer” them abroad.“Two laboratories in two different countries, working independently of each other, concluded that Alexei had been poisoned,” Navalnaya said in a statement posted on social media, noting that she received the results a few months ago.Navalnaya did not identify which poison was allegedly used on her husband, and instead demanded the laboratories publish the results, adding “these results are of public importance and must be published.”Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said he did not know “anything about these statements of hers” and did not have further comment, Reuters reported.Key BackgroundNavalny was one of the highest profile critics of Russian President Vladimir Putin, known for campaigning against corruption in the country and launching a failed bid to run against Putin for president in 2018. In 2020, Navalny survived a poisoning attempt, which lab tests in multiple countries confirmed was from the Soviet developed nerve agent Novichok. Other Kremlin dissidents have been poisoned in the past, including defected intelligence officer Sergei Skripal, who was poisoned with Novichok in the U.K. in 2018. Navalny was arrested in 2021 after returning from Germany, and was serving multiple prison sentences, including a 19-year sentence for creating an extremist organization and financing extremism. He was moved to the arctic penal colony after disappearing for weeks. Russia confirmed Navalny’s death in February 2024, and Navalnaya said she was able to transfer his biological sample that same month.ContraRussian officials have repeatedly denied a role in Navalny’s death, and Navalnaya said she was told he died from “combined disease” including arrhythmia. In April 2024, the Associated Press also reported that U.S. intelligence officials were unable to find a “smoking gun” pointing to Putin as the person who directly ordered the dissident leader’s death. But Navalnaya continues to blame the Russian government for his death. Navalnaya gave a more graphic description of her husband’s final moments in pain in a longer video posted on YouTube, later placing blame on the Russian president. “I assert that Vladimir Putin is responsible for the murder of my husband, Alexei Navalny,” Navalnaya said, although did not provide further evidence. “I accuse the Russian security services of developing banned chemical and biological weapons. I demand that the laboratories that conducted the analyses publish their results.”Got a tip?
