I cover breaking news.Follow AuthorSep 24, 2025, 10:11am EDTSep 24, 2025, 04:23pm EDTShareSaveAdd Us On GoogleToplineTwo detainees at an Immigrations and Customs Enforcement field office in Dallas, Texas were shot and killed on Wednesday morning and a third injured, the Department of Homeland Security confirmed, after a shooter fired “indiscriminately” at the building before taking their own life.The suspected shooter died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, Homeland Security Sec. Kristi Noem said.AFP via Getty ImagesKey FactsA shooter opened fire from an adjacent building into the ICE facility around 6:40 a.m. CDT, the Dallas Police Department said.The shooter was positioned on a nearby rooftop, DHS said in a statement sent to Forbes, and fired “indiscriminately” at the ICE office, “including at a van in the sallyport where the victims were shot,” the agency said.One victim died at the scene and two were transported to the hospital with gunshot wounds, DPD said on Wednesday morning.DHS confirmed the second victim’s death later on Wednesday, and the third victim remains in critical condition.Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem confirmed the suspected shooter, who has been identified as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn, according to multiple outlets, was dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.“Early evidence that we’ve seen, from rounds that were found near the suspected shooter, contain messages that were anti-ICE in nature,” R. Joseph Rothrock said, the FBI’s special agent in charge of the Dallas field office said at a press conference.FBI Director Kash Patel later shared a photo of an unspent shell casing recovered at the scene, with one bullet appearing to read “ANTI-ICE.”DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin told Fox News the victims were “potentially detainees,” saying they were not ICE agents, while Rothrock later confirmed “no members of law enforcement were hurt during this attack” and investigators were not releasing the identities of the victims at this point.McLaughlin also said the same facility saw a “viable bomb threat” about one month ago.What Do We Know About Jahn?Jahn was born in Texas and is a registered independent who last voted in the 2024 presidential election, according to NBC News, which noted the man was recently associated with an address in Oklahoma. Jahn’s criminal record includes a 2016 felony conviction in Texas for delivering marijuana in an amount greater than a quarter of an ounce but less than five pounds, NBC News added.Crucial Quote“I would ask all of you, all of the city of Dallas residents who can hear me right now, let’s be patient, let’s remain calm, and let’s let our law enforcement partners, our police department, do their job,” Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson said at a press conference with law enforcement. The mayor said the investigation was still “active” with “a lot of unanswered questions,” and called on the public to "exercise a bit of restraint.” Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, appeared at the end of the press conference, calling on politicians to end anti-ICE rhetoric. “This needs to stop. Violence is wrong, politically motivated violence is wrong,” Cruz said, later adding “your political opponents are not Nazis. We need to learn to work together without demonizing each other, without attacking each other.”Got a tip?
