I cover breaking news.Follow AuthorSep 23, 2025, 02:25pm EDTSep 23, 2025, 03:49pm EDTShareSaveAdd Us On GoogleToplineDisney is planning another price hike in October for its popular streaming services Disney+ and Hulu, about one year after its last price increase for the platforms.Customers will see price increases on October 21, Disney said.NurPhoto via Getty ImagesKey FactsThe price for a standalone subscription for Disney+ with ads will increase from $9.99 to $11.99 per month, the company said.The same subscription without ads will rise from $15.99 to $18.99 per month—or customers could pay for annual subscription for $189.99, up from $159.99.Some of Disney’s bundle plans for its streaming services will also see price hikes starting on October 21, the entertainment company said, posting a full list of price changes on its support page.The price for standard Disney+ and Hulu plans with ads will increase from $10.99 per month to $12.99 per month, while the price for the Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ bundle with ads will increase from $16.99 to $19.99 per month.The streaming service’s bundle plans with HBO Max are also set to rise—the ad supported version will rise from $16.99 to $19.99 per month, while the ad-free version will rise from $29.99 per month to $32.99 per month.Key BackgroundSince launching Disney+ in 2019 for $6.99 per month, the entertainment giant has repeatedly raised subscription prices in an effort to make the service profitable. The most recent price hike took place last October, months after the company rolled out bundle plans with Hulu and HBO Max. Disney+ was profitable for the first time last August, the Associated Press reported. The streaming service has continued adding subscribers in 2025. In their most recent earnings call, the company said 183 million customers subscribed to their Disney+ and Hulu services, while their standalone Disney+ service had 128 million subscribers, with both options adding subscriptions over the last quarter.TangentThe price hikes come while the company deals with the aftermath of ABC’s decision to suspend and subsequently resume production of “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” The network, which is owned by Disney, pulled Kimmel off the air last week after the host’s monologue commented on the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. “We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it,” Kimmel said, referring to the shooter that investigators believe held an ideology “very different from his family,” Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said. Kimmel’s suspension came after comments from FCC Chair Brendan Carr, who critics accused of potentially violating free speech with a tactic known as “jawboning.” Kimmel’s show resumed production and will air again on Tuesday night, but will not broadcast on stations owned by Sinclair and Nexstar.Got a tip?
