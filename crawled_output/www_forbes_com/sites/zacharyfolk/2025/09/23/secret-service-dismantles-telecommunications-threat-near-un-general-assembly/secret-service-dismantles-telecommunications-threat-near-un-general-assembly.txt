I cover breaking news.Follow AuthorSep 23, 2025, 09:18am EDTSep 23, 2025, 10:25am EDTShareSaveAdd Us On GoogleToplineThe Secret Service, the agency in charge of security for the United Nations General Assembly, discovered a threatening network of over 300 servers and 10,000 SIM cards across the New York tri-state area capable of facilitating anonymous communications, disrupting cell towers, and shutting down the city’s cellular network.The Secret Service said the network posed an “imminent threat” to the agency’s operation protecting the UN General Assembly.dpa/picture alliance via Getty ImagesKey FactsThe network could have “disabled cell phone towers and potentially shut down the cellular network in New York City,” Matt McCool, the special agent in charge of the Secret Service’s New York field office.The network could also facilitate denial of service attacks and could send up to 30 million text messages per minute, McCool told the Associated Press.All of the devices were found within 35 miles of the United Nations headquarters in Midtown Manhattan.The Secret Service moved quickly to dismantle the network, which no longer poses a threat to the New York City area, McCool said.The investigation into the devices is ongoing, the Secret Service said, but early forensic analysis indicates it was used for communications between “foreign actors” and people already known to federal law enforcement.No arrests have been announced, and investigators are still searching through the equivalent of 100,000 cell phones worth of data.Key BackgroundThe network was discovered after an investigation “following multiple telecommunications-related imminent threats directed toward senior US government officials this Spring,” McCool said. The agent did not elaborate on what these threats were, but described them as “fraudulent calls.” The calls were placed to a Secret Service official and two officials at the White House, The New York Times reported. The Secret Service said the network uncovered in New York no longer posed a threat to the public, but McCool also told the Associated Press it would be “unwise to think that there’s not other networks out there being made in other cities in the United States.”Where Were The Devices Found?The Secret Service did not disclose exactly where the devices were found in the tri-state area, but did release photos of some of the devices. The servers were set up on racks in one instance, while others were placed on the floor and plugged into an outlet in what appears to be an unfurnished apartment. Investigators also reportedly found 80 grams of cocaine, illegal firearms, and other computers and phones at the locations, both The New York Times and CBS News reported.Got a tip?
