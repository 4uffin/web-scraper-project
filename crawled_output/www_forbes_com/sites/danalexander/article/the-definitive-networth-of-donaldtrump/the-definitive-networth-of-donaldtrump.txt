hat‚Äôs Donald Trump really worth?
Everyone has an opinion, but Forbes has the answer: $7.3 billion, according to our most recent tally, updated in September. Trump added $3 billion over the last year, leveraging the presidency for profit. His cryptocurrency ventures, stalled out before the election, exploded after his victory, adding an estimated $2 billion to his fortune in 10 months. Another $500 million came in court, where Trump‚Äôs legal team succeeded in eliminating a half-billion judgement against him. His once-dormant licensing business surged by another $400 million, as foreign developers clamored to do business with an American president. With most of Trump‚Äôs second term remaining, expect billions more to head his way.

Trump‚Äôs Cryptocurrency and Liquid Assets: $2.4 billion
FORBES ESTIMATE AS OF SEPTEMBER 2025Spencer Platt/Getty Images
Liquid assets
Net value: $1.1B
The president is flush with cash, having collected hundreds of millions from cryptocurrency sales. Those earnings added to a stockpile he had already been accumulating by selling his Washington, D.C. hotel and refinancing a San Francisco office complex.
Memecoin tokens
Net value: $709M
Trump launched a memecoin days before his second term began, capitalizing on the buzz surrounding his inauguration. A portion of his coins now unlock on a daily basis.
World Liberty Financial tokens
Net value: $338M
The Trump family‚Äôs primary crypto project, World Liberty Financial, got off to a rocky start. Things accelerated after Trump won the election. Buyers have now snapped up more than $1 billion of tokens. The Trump family kept a pile for themselves, which Forbes discounts while they remain locked up.
Stablecoin Business
Net value: $235M
World Liberty Financial also launched a stablecoin, USD1, which ties to the dollar and allows people to make crypto transactions with limited volatility. It‚Äôs not a new idea. ‚ÄúEverybody can mint a stablecoin,‚Äù says Matt Zhang, the founder of digital-asset firm Hivemind. ‚ÄúThe difficult part is how you drive adoption.‚Äù A firm created by the president of the United Arab Emirates offered some help to Trump‚Äôs venture, agreeing to use USD1 to make a $2 billion investment in a major crypto exchange.
Alt5
Net value: $12M
A publicly traded firm named Alt5 purchased a bundle of World Liberty tokens in August 2025. The deal left the Trump family with a bunch of cash and World Liberty with a small stake in Alt5.
Truth Social‚Äôs Parent Company: $2 billion
FORBES ESTIMATE AS OF SEPTEMBER 1, 2025SCOTT OLSON/GETTY IMAGES
Trump Media and Technology Group
Net Value: $2B
From a financial standpoint, Trump‚Äôs social-media venture is one of the most absurd businesses in America, generating sales of just $3.6 million in 2024 and recording a net loss of $401 million. Revenues dropped 12 percent in a year, even while Trump dominated most news cycles. Yet Trump-loving traders still bid up shares to head-scratching prices. Shares have lost more than half of their value, but that still leaves the president with a multibillion-dollar position.

I said, ‚ÄòWhat do you attribute this to?‚Äô He said, ‚ÄòThe campaign.‚Äô‚Äù Since then, business has only gotten stronger.JOE RAEDLE/GETTY IMAGES
