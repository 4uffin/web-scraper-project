and .5% respectively.How Have The Markets Reacted?Nvidia’s share prices rose steadily over the course of the morning, and were up 3.7% by Thursday afternoon. Intel surged as high as 29%—its single biggest day gain since October 1987. Rival AMD’s shares are down around 2.7% as the deal likely dents a critical moat the chipmaker had over Nvidia. Only AMD and Intel are licensed to manufacture x86 chips, however, this deal allows Nvidia’s powerful GPUs—which are used to power AI applications and graphically intensive tasks—to be integrated with Intel’s x86 CPUs.Key BackgroundNvidia’s investment comes weeks after the Trump administration announced the U.S. government would take a 10% stake in Intel in a $10 billion deal—turning the government into the struggling chipmaker’s third-largest shareholder. The deal converted roughly $8.9 billion in grants from former President Joe Biden’s CHIPS Act into nonvoting shares. The chipmaker was flailing before the rare intervention from the government, as well as another $2 billion investment from Japanese tech investment bank SoftBank announced days earlier. It was also a reversal of fortunes for Intel’s CEO Lip-Bu Tan, who President Donald Trump previously criticized as “highly CONFLICTED” after facing questions from Senate Republicans over his alleged ties to companies connected to the Chinese Communist Party. Trump called for Tan’s resignation in August, just weeks before announcing the deal.Got a tip?
