Siladitya Ray is a New Delhi-based Forbes news team reporter.Follow AuthorSep 17, 2025, 07:21am EDTSep 17, 2025, 07:52am EDTShareSaveCommentAdd Us On GoogleToplineBritish authorities arrested four people after videos and images of President Donald Trump alongside convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein were projected onto on Windsor Castle on Tuesday night, a short while after the president arrived in the U.K. for a state visit, during which he is scheduled to stay at the royal residence.Political campaign group Led By Donkeys project an image of Jeffrey Epstein and Donald Trump onto Windsor Castle ahead of the President's second state visit to the UK.In Pictures via Getty ImagesKey FactsThe British political activist group, Led By Donkeys, appeared to take credit as they shared a photo of the projection on the walls of the British monarch’s royal residence on Instagram, followed by the caption: “Hey Donald, welcome to Windsor Castle.”The projections showed old videos of Trump’s interactions with Epstein and photos of an alleged inscription signed by the president, which read “To Jeff — You are the greatest!”In an official statement, Thames Valley Police said four people were “arrested on suspicion of malicious communications following a public stunt in Windsor,” and all four were kept in custody.The police department’s Chief Superintendent Felicity Parker said: “We take any unauthorised activity around Windsor Castle extremely seriously…Our officers responded swiftly to stop the projection.”Parker added that the department is conducting a “thorough investigation” into the “circumstances surrounding this incident and will provide further updates.”TangentEarlier on Tuesday, a group of protestors unfurled a large banner of a photo of Trump and Epstein in an area outside Windsor Castle to protest the president’s visit. A separate activist group called Everyone Hates Elon, which usually goes after billionaire Elon Musk, took credit for the banner in an Instagram post, saying: “The British public welcomed him with THIS gigantic banner right outside Windsor Castle where he is staying with the King this week.” The group claimed 1770 people paid for the banner and claimed this visit to the UK was all about “polishing Trump's image.” The post then sarcastically urged its followers, “Please DO NOT share this picture…Thanks for co-operating at this difficult time for the President.”Chief CriticIn an op-ed published in The Guardian, London Mayor Sadiq Khan, who Trump has called a “a nasty person,”
wrote: “President Donald Trump and his coterie have perhaps done the most to fan the flames of divisive, far-right politics around the world in recent years…Scapegoating minorities, illegally deporting US citizens, deploying the military to the streets of diverse cities. These actions aren’t just inconsistent with western values – they’re straight out of the autocrat’s playbook.”What Do We Know About Trump’s Uk Visit?The president and First Lady Melania Trump arrived at the White House on Tuesday night, but their official visit begins on Wednesday. The Trumps will first meet the Prince and Princess of Wales, William and Catherine, on Wednesday morning, after which they will be staying at Windsor Castle. The President and other senior U.S. officials in his contingent will then be hosted for a state banquet by King Charles at the castle.What Do We Know About Trump’s Connection With Epstein?The president’s past connection with the disgraced financier and convicted sex offender has been under the spotlight in recent months as lawmakers have pushed for the release of the so-called “Epstein files.” Trump was known to be friends with Epstein back in the 1990s and early 2000s. In a 2002 interview with New York Magazine, Trump said he had known Epstein for “15 years,” and called him a “terrific guy.” However, the duo reportedly had a falling out in 2004 after Trump outbid Epstein for a Palm Beach mansion. The president has never been accused of any sexual misconduct in connection with Epstein.Further ReadingFour arrested after Trump, Epstein images projected onto Britain's Windsor Castle (Reuters)After the far right’s march on our streets, Londoners must show Trump we reject his politics of fear (The Guardian)Got a tip?
