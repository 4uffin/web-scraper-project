All rights reservedKey FactsIn a 40-minute interview on MSNBC, Harris told host Rachel Maddow she had always believed that “titans of industry” would serve as a guardrail for democracy in the country.But said “one-by-one-by-one, they have been silent…I’d use the word feckless,” adding, “It’s not like they’re going to lose their yacht or their house in the Hamptons.”Harris then warned business leaders that “Democracy sustains capitalism,” and said: “Right now we are dealing with…a tyrant.”The former vice president said the U.S. used to “compare the strength of our democracy to communist dictators…That’s what we’re dealing with right now in Donald Trump, and these titans of industry are not speaking up.”Harris said the silence from business leaders is “perhaps because of [Trump’s] threats and the way he has used the federal government to take out vengeance on his critics.”The former vice president also posited that the industry “titans” may be silent because they want a merger approved or wish to avoid a federal investigation, but at some point, they’ve got to stand up...and be the guardrails against a tyrant who is using the federal government to execute his whim and fancy because of a fragile ego.”What Did Harris Say About Biden?In the interview, Harris was asked about the remark she made in her new book, “107 Days,” on the former president’s “recklessness” in running for a second term. Harris said: “So when I write this, it's because I’ve realized that I have and had a certain responsibility that I should have followed through on…And so when I talk about the recklessness as much as anything, I'm talking about myself. There was so much as we know at stake.” She added that she thought at the time asking Biden not to run would have come off as “completely self-serving.” What Did Harris Say About Jimmy Kimmel Being Taken Of Air?Harris talked about people organizing to resist Trump’s actions and gave the example of late-night comedian Jimmy Kimmel’s scheduled return on Tuesday. Kimmel’s show was taken off the air last week for a monologue that criticized the GOP and President Donald Trump after the murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. “Talk about the power being with the people — and the people making that clear with their checkbooks — as it relates to the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel. We saw the power of the people over the last few days, and it spoke volumes, and it moved a decision in the right direction.”What Did Harris Say About A Potential 2028 Run?When asked if she would consider running for president again in 2028, Harris said: That’s not my focus right now.” Maddow then brought up Harris’s decision not to run for Governor of California and asked, “When you said you're not going to run for governor…Were you saying you are never going to run for anything ever again, or were you just saying I'm not going to run for that office right now?” Harris responded: “That was the decision before me, and I made the decision not to run for governor of California.”Further ReadingKamala Harris Won’t Seek Elected Office ‘For Now (Forbes)Kamala Harris Blasts Trump’s ‘Narrow, Self-Serving Vision Of America’ In First Major Speech Since Leaving Office (Forbes)Got a tip?
