Siladitya Ray is a New Delhi-based Forbes news team reporter.Follow AuthorSep 24, 2025, 12:12am EDTShareSaveCommentAdd Us On GoogleToplineJimmy Kimmel thanked his audience for their “overwhelming” support and addressed his comments about conservative activist Charlie Kirk’s assassination—which angered several conservatives and President Donald Trump—saying he does not believe the suspected killer “represents anyone,” as the comedian’s late-night show returned to air on Tuesday night after a controversial week-long suspension.Jimmy Kimmel Live returned to air on Tuesday after a week-long suspension.Disney via Getty ImagesKey FactsKimmel got a warm reception from his audience when he arrived on stage to start his show, as people applauded and chanted his name, to which he responded, “I’m happy to be here tonight with you.”Kimmel then talked about the “overwhelming” response he had received in the past few days, as he thanked his audience, fellow late-night hosts and even GOP Senator Ted Cruz for speaking up against his removal from the air.]The late-night host appeared emotional as he addressed his comments about Kirk, saying: “You understand it was never my intention to make light of the murder of a young man…I don’t think there’s anything funny about it.”Kimmel said it was never his intention to blame any specific group for the assassination, and he was trying to make the opposite point, but for those “who think I did point a finger, I get why you’re upset…If the situation were reversed, there’s a good chance I would’ve felt the same way.”The comedian then added: “I don’t think the murderer who shot Charlie Kirk represents anyone; this is a sick person who thinks violence is a solution, and it isn’t ever.”What Did Kimmel Say About The Fcc Chair?Earlier in his monologue, Kimmel joked that late-night hosts from other countries reached out to him to express support. He said: “This country has become so authoritarian that even the Germans are like, ‘Come here!'” He later added, “I don’t want to make this about me. This show is not important. What is important is that we get to live in a country that allows us to have a show like this.” Kimmel then turned his attention to FCC Chair Brendan Carr, saying it was “not legal” and “un-American” to threaten ABC affiliates to take his show off the air. “Brendan Carr is the most embarrassing car Republicans have embraced since this one,” Kimmel said as he showed a photo of a Tesla Cybertruck with Trump’s name painted on it.This is a breaking story and will be updated.Got a tip?
