Siladitya Ray is a New Delhi-based Forbes news team reporter.Follow AuthorSep 24, 2025, 12:12am EDTSep 24, 2025, 07:25am EDTShareSaveCommentAdd Us On GoogleToplineJimmy Kimmel addressed his comments about conservative activist Charlie Kirk’s assassination, saying he does not believe the suspected killer “represents anyone,” and called out President Donald Trump, FCC Chair Brendan Carr and “the government threat to silence a comedian,” as his late-night talk show returned to air on Tuesday night after a controversial week-long suspension.Jimmy Kimmel Live returned to air on Tuesday after a week-long suspension.Disney via Getty ImagesKey FactsKimmel got a warm reception from his audience when he arrived on stage to start his show, as people applauded and chanted his name, to which he responded, “I’m happy to be here tonight with you.”Kimmel opened his monologue talking about the “overwhelming” response he had received in the past few days, as he thanked his audience, fellow late-night hosts and “even my old pal” GOP Senator Ted Cruz for speaking up against his removal from the air.The late-night host appeared emotional as he addressed his comments about Kirk, saying: “You understand it was never my intention to make light of the murder of a young man…I don’t think there’s anything funny about it.”Kimmel said it was never his intention to blame any specific group for the assassination, and he was trying to make the opposite point, but for those “who think I did point a finger, I get why you’re upset…If the situation were reversed, there’s a good chance I would’ve felt the same way.”The comedian then added: “I don’t think the murderer who shot Charlie Kirk represents anyone; this is a sick person who believed violence is a solution, and it isn’t ever.”What Did Kimmel Say About The Fcc Chair?Earlier in his monologue, Kimmel joked that late-night hosts from other countries reached out to him to express support. He said: “This country has become so authoritarian that even the Germans are like, ‘Come here!'” He later added, “I don’t want to make this about me. This show is not important. What is important is that we get to live in a country that allows us to have a show like this.” Kimmel then turned his attention to FCC Chair Brendan Carr and his comments “telling an American company we can do this the easy way or the hard way” and asking broadcasters to “change conduct and take action on Kimmel.” The late-night host said: “In addition to being a direct violation of the First Amendment, is not a particularly intelligent threat to make in public.” He then added: “Brendan Carr is the most embarrassing car Republicans have embraced since this one,” as he showed a photo of a Tesla Cybertruck with a Trump livery painted on it. He then added: “I never imagined I’d be in situation like this, but one thing I learned from Lenny Bruce and George Carlin and Howard Stern is that a government threat to silence a comedian the president doesn’t like is anti-American.”What Did Kimmel Say About President Trump?Kimmel then turned his attention to the president and showed of a clip of him telling reporters that the late-night comedian was a “wack job” with “no talent” and claiming he had “no ratings.” Kimmel then quipped, “Well, I do tonight,” as the audience gave him a standing ovation. The comedian then continued: “You almost have to feel sorry for him. He did his best to cancel me. Instead, he forced millions of people to watch the show. That backfired bigly. He might have to release the Epstein files to distract us from this now.”What Has Trump Said About Kimmel’s Return?In Truth Social post made after Kimmel’s show was taped but just before it aired, Trump attacked ABC and the comedian and signaled he may sue the network. “I can’t believe ABC Fake News gave Jimmy Kimmel his job back,” Trump wrote. The president claimed, without sharing evidence, that Kimmel was an “arm” of the Democratic Party and said he believed the broadcast of his show amounted to an illegal campaign contribution to the Democrats.What Did Kimmel Say About Disney?In his monologue, Kimmel addressed the question of if Disney had placed any conditions on his return. “There is one. Disney has asked me to read the following statement, and I've agreed to do it.” Kimmel then pulled out a piece of paper and joked: “To reactivate your Disney Plus and Hulu account open the Disney Plus app on your smart TV or TV connected device.” The joke was a reference to people threatening to cancel their Disney streaming subscriptions if Kimmel was kept off air. “The people who run this network have allowed me to evolve and to stretch the boundaries of what was once traditional for a late-night talk show, even when it made them uncomfortable, which I do a lot.” However, Kimmel said he was “not happy” with the network’s decision to yank him off air last week. “I did not agree with that decision and I told them that and we had many conversations. I shared my point of view. They shared theirs. We talked it through and at the end, even though they didn't have to…they welcomed me back on the air.” He added that he believes this decision “unfortunately and I think unjustly this puts them at risk. The president of the United States made it very clear he wants to see me and the hundreds of people who work here fired from our jobs. Our leader celebrates Americans losing their livelihoods because he can't take a joke.”What Did Kimmel Say About Sinclair And Nexstar?Both Nexstar and Sinclair Broadcast Group, which own or control around 30% of ABC’s local affiliate stations, announced they would not air “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” Nexstar said it would preempt the show “pending assurance that all parties are committed to fostering an environment of respectful, constructive dialogue in the markets we serve.” Sinclair Broadcast Group made a similar announcement and said, “discussions with ABC are ongoing as we evaluate the show’s potential return.” Kimmel addressed this briefly in his monologue, saying: “We are still on the air in most of the country, except ironically for Washington D.C., where we have been preempted. We are off the air in Nashville, New Orleans, Portland, Oregon, Salt Lake City, and St. Louis, where none of my wife's family is able to watch the show tonight. So, sorry, Aunt Sharon. Sorry, Aunt Marine. You'll have to go to YouTube, I guess.”TangentRobert De Niro appeared in a skit during Kimmel’s monologue, playing a mafia-style character who has been appointed as the new chairman of the FCC, in an apparent swipe at Carr. The skit started with De Niro’s character appearing to threaten The View’s host, Whoopi Goldberg, saying: “You tell Whoopi over there she better show a little respect or the only ‘View’ she's getting is from under George Washington, the bridge, not the guy.” When Kimmel asked De Niro, “It seems like the FCC is using mob tactics to suppress free speech,” the actor retorted, “It's just me, Jimmy. The chairman of the FCC gently suggesting that you gently shut the f— up.”Further ReadingTrump Calls Jimmy Kimmel ‘Arm Of…DNC’—Signals He May Sue ABC As Comedian Returns To Air (Forbes)One-Third Of ABC Stations Won’t Air ‘Jimmy Kimmel Live!’—Nexstar Joins Sinclair In Boycott (Forbes)‘Jimmy Kimmel Live!’ Returns Tuesday—But Not On Sinclair-Owned Stations (Forbes)Got a tip?
