Siladitya Ray is a New Delhi-based Forbes news team reporter.Follow AuthorSep 24, 2025, 01:58am EDTSep 24, 2025, 07:40am EDTShareSaveCommentAdd Us On GoogleToplinePresident Donald Trump attacked ABC on Tuesday night for allowing late-night host Jimmy Kimmel to return to air and appeared to threatened legal action against the network—claiming Kimmel acted as an arm of the Democratic Party—as the comedian took multiple shots at the president and his administration in his opening monologue during his return broadcast.President Donald Trump said he couldn't believe ABC gave Jimmy Kimmel "his job back" and insisted that he'd been told the comedian's late-night show had been canceled.Getty ImagesKey FactsIn a post on his Truth Social platform, made an hour before Kimmel returned to air, Trump wrote: “I can’t believe ABC Fake News gave Jimmy Kimmel his job back.”The president claimed the White House was informed that Kimmel’s show had been canceled, even though Disney told news outlets last week it was pausing the show “indefinitely.”Trump suggested that “something happened” between last week and now that allowed Kimmel’s return as he claimed the comedian gets poor ratings and “puts the Network in jeopardy by playing 99% positive Democrat GARBAGE.”The president then accused Kimmel of being “yet another arm” of the Democratic National Committee, without offering evidence, and suggested that airing his show “would be a major Illegal Campaign Contribution.”Trump then said he will test ABC and signaled that he intends to take the broadcaster to court on this matter.Crucial Quote“Last time I went after them, they gave me $16 Million Dollars. This one sounds even more lucrative. A true bunch of losers! Let Jimmy Kimmel rot in his bad Ratings,” Trump’s post added.What Did Kimmel Say About Trump On Tuesday?During his monologue on Tuesday, Kimmel showed a clip of the president telling reporters that the late-night show host was a “wack job” with “no talent” and ‘no ratings.” Kimmel quipped, “Well, I do tonight,” pointing to the increased interest in his show after him being taken off air and Trump’s attacks. The comedian then continued: “You almost have to feel sorry for him. He did his best to cancel me. Instead, he forced millions of people to watch the show. That backfired bigly. He might have to release the Epstein files to distract us from this now.” Trump’s Truth Social post had not been made at the time Kimmel’s show was being taped, the comedian said: “You know, as of this taping, the president has not weighed in on ABC's decision to put us back on the air. I don't know, maybe he's saving it for his late night toilet time.” Later when talking about Disney, Kimmel appeared to allude to potential pressure the company may face for bringing his show back on air. He said “unfortunately and I think unjustly this puts them at risk. The president of the United States made it very clear he wants to see me and the hundreds of people who work here fired from our jobs. Our leader celebrates Americans losing their livelihoods because he can't take a joke.”What Was Trump’s Reaction To Kimmel Being Taken Off Air Last Week?In a Truth Social post, Trump cheered the news of Kimmel being taken off air and even claimed the comedian’s show had been canceled. “The ratings challenged Jimmy Kimmel Show is CANCELLED. Congratulations to ABC for finally having the courage to do what had to be done. Kimmel has ZERO talent, and worse ratings than even Colbert, if that’s possible.” The White House’s Rapid Response X account also chimed in, tweeting: “They're doing their viewers a favor. Jimmy is a sick freak!” Trump later doubled down in a press conference and said: “Kimmel was fired because he had bad ratings and he said a horrible thing about a great gentleman known as Charlie Kirk...you can call that free speech or not, he was fired for lack of talent.”What Do We Know About Trump And Kimmel’s Long-Running Feud?Trump’s feud with Kimmel stretches back to his first term when the late-night talk show host criticized the president’s actions in office and even called him out for turning “an angry mob” against lawmakers
and former Vice President Mike Pence because “he is too angry, too insecure, and too incompetent to deal with the fact that he lost an election.” While Kimmel was hosting the 2024 Academy Awards, Trump wrote on Truth Social: “Has there EVER been a WORSE HOST than Jimmy Kimmel at The Oscars. His opening was that of a less than average person trying too hard to be something which he is not, and never can be.” Kimmel read out the post live on air and shot back, “I’m surprised you’re still watching…isn’t it past your jail time?” After Trump won the election, Kimmel said, “It was a terrible night for everyone who voted against him. And guess what? It was a bad night for everyone who voted for him too. You just don’t realize it yet.” When CBS announced its plans to cancel Stephen Colbert’s “The Late Show” after its current season ends in 2026, Trump cheered on that decision and added, “I hear Jimmy Kimmel is next.”Further ReadingJimmy Kimmel Returns: Says Charlie Kirk’s Killer Doesn’t ‘Represent Anyone’ As He Calls Out FCC Chair And Trump (Forbes)Got a tip?
