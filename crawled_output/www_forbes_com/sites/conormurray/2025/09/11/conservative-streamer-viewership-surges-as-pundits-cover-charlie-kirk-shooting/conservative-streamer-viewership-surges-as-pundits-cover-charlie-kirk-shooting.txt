Piker’s stream started out covering general news, including the New York City mayoral race and Epstein documents, but Piker learned of Kirk’s shooting less than an hour into filming and pivoted his broadcast to focus on Kirk. Piker’s previous broadcasts generally reached about 500,000 to 700,000 viewers.What Have Conservative Streamers Said About Kirk?Knowles opened a video posted Thursday afternoon by declaring Kirk “would have been president” one day, stating “his friends knew it, his admirers knew it and his enemies knew it.” Many of these conservative streamers, including Kelly and Pool, knew Kirk personally and mourned him during their streams. Shapiro, in a video posted Thursday, said Kirk was his friend, calling his assassination “truly horrifying in every possible way.”What Do We Know About Charlie Kirk’s Shooting?Kirk was shot and killed at an event at Utah Valley University on Wednesday afternoon. The assassination sparked tributes from politicians of both parties as many condemned political violence. The perpetrator remains at large as of Thursday afternoon, and the FBI has since released photos of a person of interest, which show a man wearing dark clothing, including a t-shirt bearing an American flag, a hat and sunglasses. Authorities said at a press conference earlier Thursday the suspected perpetrator appears to be “of college age” and “blended in well with the institution.” President Donald Trump, who announced Kirk’s death on Truth Social Wednesday afternoon, said Thursday he would honor Kirk with a posthumous Presidential Medal of Freedom. Kirk, 31, was the founder of Turning Point USA, an organization promoting conservatism on college campuses, and he was well known for his podcast, “The Charlie Kirk Show,” and his widely followed social media presence.Further ReadingCharlie Kirk Shooting: Photo Of Person Of Interest Released (Live Updates) (Forbes)Got a tip?
