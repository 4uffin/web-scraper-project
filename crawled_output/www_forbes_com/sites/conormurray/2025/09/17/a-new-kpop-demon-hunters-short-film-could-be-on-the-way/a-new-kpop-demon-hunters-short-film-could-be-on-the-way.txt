(Photo by Charley Gallay/Getty Images for Netflix)Getty Images for NetflixKey FactsThe MPA, which gives content ratings to movies, gave a project titled “Debut: A KPOP Demon Hunters Story” a PG rating, according to its weekly bulletin of film ratings released Wednesday.Few details are known about the project, including a plot or release date, though the bulletin says it is an animated short that is set to be distributed by Sony Pictures Entertainment, which produced the original “KPop Demon Hunters” film before Netflix acquired distribution rights.The animated short was given a PG rating for “some action/violence and scary images,” according to the MPA bulletin.In 2023, Variety reported Sony Pictures Animation had launched a mentorship program for artists from underrepresented groups to create animated shorts in the “Spider-Man” and “KPop Demon Hunters” universe, though it’s unclear whether the project rated by the MPA is related to Sony’s mentorship initiative.Forbes has reached out to Sony Pictures for comment.What Else Do We Know About The Future Of “kpop Demon Hunters?”Sony and Netflix began talks in August to create an animated sequel to “KPop Demon Hunters,” multiple outlets reported, which appears to be a separate project from the animated short rated by the MPA, though few details are known about a potential second film. Maggie Kang, director of the original film, told Variety in July she wanted to helm a sequel: “We’ve set up so much for potential backstory. Obviously, there’s a lot of questions that are left unanswered and areas that are not explored, and we had to do that because there’s only so much movie you could tell in 85 minutes,” Kang said, adding she had developed backstories for the characters Zoey and Mira that didn’t make the cut for the first film. Key Background“KPop Demon Hunters” became a smash hit this summer and usurped “Red Notice” as Netflix’s most-watched movie of all time in August, just two months after its release. The movie also had a brief, but successful, stint at the box office last month when Netflix released it in theaters for a two-day exhibition. The movie ranked No. 1 at the box office for the Aug. 22 through Aug. 24 weekend, earning an estimated $18 million. The movie also boasts a hugely successful soundtrack: Three of the top five songs on the Billboard Hot 100 this week come from “KPop Demon Hunters,” led by “Golden,” which has ranked No. 1 on the Billboard chart for five weeks, making it one of this year’s biggest hits. The movie’s soundtrack also hit No. 1 on the Billboard 200 albums chart for the first time this week, beating out Sabrina Carpenter, who released a new album earlier this month. “KPop Demon Hunters” was a critical success, earning a 95% critics score and a 99% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes.Further Reading‘KPop Demon Hunters’ Breaks Record As Netflix’s Most-Watched Movie Ever (Forbes)Got a tip?
