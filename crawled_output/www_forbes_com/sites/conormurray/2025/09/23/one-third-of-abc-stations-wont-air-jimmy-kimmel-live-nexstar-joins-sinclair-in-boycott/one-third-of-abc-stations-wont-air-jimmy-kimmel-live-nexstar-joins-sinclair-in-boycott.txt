Murray is a Forbes news reporter covering entertainment trends.Follow AuthorSep 23, 2025, 11:19am EDTSep 23, 2025, 12:22pm EDTShareSaveCommentAdd Us On GoogleToplineNexstar, which owns dozens of ABC stations, said it will not air “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” when the late-night show returns to the network Tuesday, joining Sinclair Broadcast Group in boycotting the show amid controversy over the host’s comments critical of Republicans and Donald Trump following the murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. ABC announced on Monday Kimmel would return to the air Tuesday night.DisneyKey FactsNexstar said Tuesday morning it would “stand by” a decision it made last week to cease airing “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” on the ABC stations it owns, even after the host and ABC reached an agreement to bring back the late-night show Tuesday night.Nexstar said it would not air Kimmel’s show “pending assurance that all parties are committed to fostering an environment of respectful, constructive dialogue in the markets we serve.”The company’s decision comes one day after Sinclair, another major television station operator, said it would not air Kimmel’s show on its ABC affiliates as it engages in discussions with the network to “evaluate the show’s potential return.”Nexstar operates 28 ABC stations, multiple outlets reported, while Sinclair operates 38, representing about a third of the more than 200 ABC affiliate stations nationwide. Two major markets—Nashville (Nexstar’s WKRN) and Washington D.C. (Sinclair’s WJLA)—won’t air Kimmel.
When Does Kimmel Return To The Air?ABC announced on Monday Kimmel’s show would return Tuesday night after the host and the network held “thoughtful conversations.” The network said it previously chose to pull Kimmel’s show “to avoid further inflaming a tense situation at an emotional moment for our country,” stating some of Kimmel's remarks were “ill-timed and thus insensitive.” The decision followed an outpouring of support from Hollywood celebrities, including Kimmel’s fellow late-night hosts, as well as Democrats, who considered Kimmel’s suspension an infringement on free speech. TangentNexstar is seeking FCC approval for its $6.2 billion acquisition of TEGNA, another broadcast company. After Nexstar said last week it would pre-empt Kimmel’s show, FCC Chairman Brendan Carr thanked the company for “doing the right thing.”These Abc Stations Won't Air KimmelNexstar stations not showing Kimmel: WTEN in Albany, N.Y.; WJBF in Augusta, Ga.; KSVI in Billings, Mont.; WIVT in Binghamton, N.Y.; WVNY in Burlington, Vt.; WBOY in Clarksville/Weston, W.V.; WDHN in Dothan, Ala.; WJET in Erie, Pa.; WEHT in Evansville, Ill.; WOTV in Grand Rapids, Mich.; WHTM in Harrisburg, Pa.; WTNH in Hartford/New Haven, Conn.; KODE in Joplin, Mo.; WATE in Knoxville, Tenn.; WLAJ in Lansing, Mich.; KAMC in Lubbock, Texas; KMID in Midland/Odessa, Texas; WKRN in Nashville; WGNO in New Orleans; WMBB in Panama City, Fla.; WRIC in Richmond, Va.; WTVO in Rockford, Ill.; KTVX in Salt Lake City; KCAU in Sioux City, Iowa; WSYR in Syracuse, N.Y.; WAWV in Terre Haute, Ind.; KTKA in Topeka, Kan.; WJHL in the Tri-Cities area spanning Virginia and Tennessee; WUTR in Utica, N.Y.; WWTI in Watertown, N.Y.; WTRF in Wheeling, W.V. and Steubenville, Ohio and WYTV in Youngstown, Ohio.Sinclair ABC affiliates not showing Kimmel: KTXS in Abilene/Sweetwater, Texas; KVII and KVIH in Amarillo, Texas; WABM, WBMA and WDBB in Birmingham, Ala.; WICD and WICS in Champaign/Springfield/Decatur, Ill.; WCHS in Charleston/Huntington, W.V.; WCIV in Charleston, S.C.; WTVC in Chattanooga, Tenn.; WSYX in Columbus, Ohio; WKEF in Dayton, Ohio; KAEF in Eureka, Calif.; WPDE in Florence/Myrtle Beach, S.C.; WXLV in Greensboro/High Point/Winston Salem, N.C.; WLOS and WCTI in Greenville, N.C.; KHGI, KHGI-CD, KWNB and KWNB-LD in Lincoln, Neb.; KATV in Little Rock, Ark.; WGXA in Macon, Ga.; WEAR in Mobile, Ala. and Pensacola, Fla.; KTVO in Ottumwa, Iowa and Kirksville, Mo.; KATU in Portland, Ore.; KHQA in Quincy, Ill.; WSET in Roanoke/Lynchburg, Va.; WHAM in Rochester, N.Y.; KTXE-LD in San Angelo, Texas; KOMO in Seattle.; KDNL in St. Louis; WGTQ, WGTU, WPBN and WTOM in Traverse City/Cadillac, Mich.; KTUL in Tulsa, Okla.; and WJLA in Washington, D.C.Further Reading‘Jimmy Kimmel Live!’ Returns Tuesday—But Not On Sinclair-Owned Stations (Forbes)These Celebrities—Streep, Hanks, Portman, More—Signed An ACLU Open Letter Backing Kimmel (Forbes)Got a tip?
