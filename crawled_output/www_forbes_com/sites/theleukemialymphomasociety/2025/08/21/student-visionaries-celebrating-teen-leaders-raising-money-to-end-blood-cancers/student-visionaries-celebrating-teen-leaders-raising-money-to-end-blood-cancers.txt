A key fundraiser for The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, the campaign is also an effective megaphone for spreading accurate information about blood cancers and a unique chance for teens to hone skills they may soon need as professionals.
Here’s how it works: Student leaders are nominated by community leaders, educators or their peers. They then work with LLS staff to develop a business plan for success. Teams then have seven weeks to educate their respective communities about blood cancers and fundraise for groundbreaking research and patient support programs.
“When young people advocate for LLS, they not only raise critical funds — they inspire entire communities to take action,” said Coker Powell, LLS’s executive vice president and chief revenue officer.
Teens also get to practice public speaking, networking and financial planning, among other professional skills, through this philanthropic leadership program. Many top teen fundraisers have gone on to make remarkable achievements, gaining admission to competitive universities, winning prestigious awards like becoming a Top 40 finalist in the Regeneron Science Talent Search, and launching their own startups.
“Through this program, students gain leadership, empathy and a strong sense of social responsibility while raising money for lifesaving research and patient support,” said Loretta Mason, senior manager of social responsibility and community investment at Sunbelt Rentals, a National Presenting Partner of Student Visionaries of the Year.
Each year, the campaign creates a lasting impact on student leaders.
“When teens champion our cause, they grow into lifelong advocates for health equity, scientific discovery and patient support,” Powell said.

What Was Your Reason for Fundraising?
Posey: We began fundraising as soon as Cedar was well enough from his cancer treatments to begin organizing a team. Cedar had befriended several patients on the infusion floor during his overnight stays, many of whom needed alternative treatment pathways due to the volatility of the chemotherapy drugs. Yet, funding for new kinds of treatments is still few and far between. Organizations like LLS that support clinical trials and research are the reason why more and more of these kinds of patients are able to survive their cancers. Without our work, I might not have a brother. Without our work, millions of cancer patients would not become cancer survivors.
How Was It Being On A Fundraising Team?
Cedar: As Team ConneLLS for a Cure, we quickly found that we worked best when we worked to our individual strengths: Posey’s skill with promoting and organizing, alongside my ability to pitch and strategize, meant efficiency without stepping on one another’s toes. When it came to encouraging our fellow team members, though, we were a united front. Orienting and leading a team of both teens and adults is a lot like being captain of a sports team: Energy is everything. We even had team pep rallies when we wanted to really push to the finish line of the campaign. In any case, the friends and family on our team were amazing, and we couldn’t have accomplished what we had without them.
How Did The Experience Prepare You For The Future?
Cedar & Posey: The connections we forged, the experience we gained and the people we touched are individually invaluable — and yet this experience gave us all three. As we look out at the future and the real world, it seems far less opaque and daunting than it did six months ago. Instead, we feel confident that we have a place to meaningfully contribute to the world as long as we bring as much compassion and tenacity to our future endeavors as we did to this campaign. So, this remarkable experience not only empowered us and our family and friends, but it also empowered the patients whose prognoses benefitted from greater access to clinical research and drug trials.

What Was Your Reason for Fundraising?
MaryAlan: All our families had been touched by blood cancers. My uncle died from leukemia in 2022, and four months later, my cousin was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma. Sophia’s father’s mentor and business partner died from multiple myeloma in 2022, and Liv’s grandfather died from leukemia when her father was 30 years old. Liv’s sister started this team in 2022, and we wanted to carry on her legacy.
How Was It Being On A Fundraising Team?
Sophia: The Student Visionaries of the Year campaign provides an incredible learning experience. We fed off each other's energy and shared passion for this cause. We learned how to collaborate toward a common goal and motivate one another. One of our most valuable teamwork lessons was discovering that we each brought different strengths and community connections to the table. Recognizing these unique contributions helped us work more effectively as a team.
How Did The Experience Prepare You For The Future?
Liv: My public speaking skills improved dramatically, and I became much more comfortable reaching out to people I didn’t know and speaking with them. Working on the campaign opened my eyes to my own potential. I discovered I could achieve far more than I ever imagined. As a team, we learned that even our seemingly small efforts could create significant impact.

What Was Your Reason for Fundraising?
Piper: My fundraising journey has always been rooted in my passion for helping others. So, when I was asked by two of my closest friends to join a team in the fight against cancer, it was an easy yes. Knowing that my efforts were directly helping patients and their families, while simultaneously contributing to the search for a cure, fueled my fundraising efforts. The Student Visionaries of the Year campaign enabled me to be part of an organization that provides hope, resources, strength and support for those affected by cancer. For that, I am eternally grateful.
How Was It Being On A Fundraising Team?
Piper: Working together on a team deeply committed to making an impact was truly inspiring. Watching my fundraising team, Bears Beating Cancer, achieve all of our goals after weeks of dedication and planning was incredibly rewarding. The support my team gave me throughout my fundraising efforts was invaluable. Planning fundraising events and discussing campaign strategies were what made my team successful. The fight against cancer needs to be fought together, and the success of LLS fundraising teams across the country demonstrates that.
How Did The Experience Prepare You For The Future?
Piper: Participating in the Student Visionaries of the Year campaign taught me valuable leadership skills and about the importance of teamwork. It also enhanced my communication skills. Success in pitching to companies and conducting individual online outreach taught me to be more confident and assertive in professional settings. At the same time, the lack of response or contribution by companies taught me not to let rejection stop me from achieving my goals. Overall, I learned that a strong work ethic is the key to success, a quality that I will carry with me beyond the fundraising challenge.
