Alison is a senior news reporter covering US politics and legal news.Follow AuthorSep 19, 2025, 02:55pm EDTSep 19, 2025, 04:34pm EDTShareSaveCommentAdd Us On GoogleToplineA central figure in the Jeffrey Epstein sexual abuse saga—former prosecutor Alex Acosta, who granted in 2007 the former financier what’s been widely blasted as a “sweetheart deal” for his alleged crimes—has no regrets about the agreement, Democratic lawmakers said Friday, as the former Trump official faces questioning from the House Oversight Committee.Alex Acosta, center, arrives for a House Oversight Committee deposition about Jeffrey Epstein on September 19 in Washington D.C.CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty ImagesKey FactsAcosta, who served as the U.S. Attorney in the Southern District of Florida and later became President Donald Trump’s Labor Secretary, testified to the House Oversight Committee behind closed doors on Friday, as lawmakers asked about the former prosecutor’s decision to reach a non-prosecution agreement with Epstein in 2007.The agreement has been widely criticized, including by Trump officials such as FBI Director Kash Patel, as it allowed Epstein to escape federal charges and only serve a brief prison stint for state charges of solicitation of prosecution—and even then, he was allowed to leave prison and spend much of his time at his office under “work release.”While the exact details of Acosta’s interview are not yet known, Rep. Yassamin Ansari, D-Ariz., told CNN he is “not showing any remorse” and “does not seem to think that he did, in fact, strike a sweetheart deal,” with Acosta reportedly telling lawmakers he believed “justice had been served” through the 2007 agreement.Acosta “would not admit” that he made a “sweetheart deal” with Epstein, Rep. Robert Garcia, D-Calif., similarly told reporters Friday, saying Acosta “stands by the decision to have given Mr. Epstein a sweetheart deal” and “would not claim any responsibility” to Epstein’s victims who were abused while Epstein was out on work release.Ansari said Acosta was being “quite evasive” overall during his testimony, saying it was “very difficult to get straightforward answers out of him” regarding his investigation and what he knew about Epstein, including Epstein’s relationship with Trump.Acosta’s interview is taking place behind closed doors but House Oversight Committee chair James Comer, R-Ky., told Politico the interview “will be public record,” though it’s unclear when the transcript could be released.What Did Acosta Say About Epstein’s Victims?Ansari and other House Democrats criticized Acosta on Friday for claiming to have little knowledge about Epstein’s victims during his investigation into the financier. Acosta “repeatedly said he does not know” details about Epstein’s victims because “in his position he was not briefed on the minutiae of the case,” Ansari told CNN—which she called “very hard to believe”—and Rep. Melanie Stansbury, D-N.M., told Politico that Acosta testified “he had not actually read the statements of the victims” when he was probing Epstein’s alleged abuse. “Mr. Acosta, at least to us in this deposition, essentially said he didn’t have faith in the victims, their stories and their ability to tell their own story and their own testimony,” Rep. Maxwell Frost, D-Fla., told reporters Friday. “It seems like Mr. Acosta really had no idea about what was going on in his own office during this investigation.”What To Watch ForHouse Oversight’s interview with Acosta is part of the Republican-led committee’s broader investigation into the Epstein case. The committee has issued a subpoena for all of the government’s files on Epstein, which the Justice Department is complying with, and has called numerous government officials to testify about their involvement with Epstein and the case. Among those scheduled for interviews in the coming weeks are former Attorneys General Jeff Sessions and Merrick Garland, former FBI Director James Comey, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former President Bill Clinton, who has been identified as having connections to Epstein, but has never been accused of any wrongdoing in relation to him.What Does The Non-Prosecution Agreement Say?The non-prosecution agreement stated that the federal government had investigated Epstein regarding a number of charges—including knowingly persuading minors to engage in prosecution, engaging in illicit sexual conduct with minors and knowingly “recruiting, enticing and obtaining” minors to “engage in a commercial sex act”—but agreed to drop these charges in favor of Epstein pleading guilty to state charges he had been indicted on. Epstein pleaded guilty to two state charges of soliciting prosecution and solicitation of minors for prosecution, and had to register as a sex offender and serve consecutive prison terms of 12 and six months. He also was not allowed to contest civil lawsuits brought against him by victims. The agreement also controversially stated that if Epstein fulfilled the terms of the agreement, no federal charges would be brought against Epstein’s co-conspirators. Associate Ghislaine Maxwell has used that provision to challenge her conviction on sex trafficking charges, which she’s still appealing while serving prison time, but the DOJ has argued the provision only applies to charges in Florida, not in New York, where Maxwell was ultimately indicted.What Has Acosta Said Previously?Acosta has defended his role in Epstein’s prosecution and the decision to reach a plea deal with the financier, saying in 2019 he “believed we proceeded appropriately.” The “goal” of his investigation was to “put Epstein behind bars, ensure he registered as a sexual offender, provide victims with a means to seek restitution, and protect the public by putting them on notice that a sexual predator was within their midst,” Acosta said, shortly before he ended up resigning from the first Trump administration amid the controversy. He also supported Epstein’s 2019 arrest in New York, which he said was based on “new evidence” that he didn’t have during his investigation. The prosecutor’s comments on the Epstein case have long drawn controversy, however, as Acosta refused to apologize to Epstein’s victims, who said they were unfairly kept in the dark about the government’s investigation. Acosta also claimed that the non-prosecution agreement allowed Epstein to face harsher penalties for his state crimes than would have otherwise been the case, claiming state prosecutors were “ready to let Epstein walk free,” but former Palm Beach State Attorney Barry Krischer opposed that account, saying Acosta’s office “always had the ability to file its own federal charges” and the former prosecutor “should not be allowed to rewrite history.”Key BackgroundAcosta’s work on the Epstein case has been under scrutiny since the financier’s arrest in 2019. The DOJ’s Office of Professional Responsibility probed the former U.S. attorney’s handling of the investigation and concluded in a 2020 report that Acosta’s decision to resolve the Epstein case through the non-prosecution agreement “constitutes poor judgment.” Acosta “resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were completed” and “agreed to several unusual and problematic terms” as part of the agreement, the office concluded, also finding Epstein’s victims “were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by the Department.” The non-prosecution agreement has come under fire again in recent months as interest in Epstein has resurged amid the Justice Department’s refusal to release more of its files on Epstein. As Americans even on the right have slammed the DOJ for its lack of transparency around the case, officials have pointed to Acosta’s failings to claim their hands on the Epstein case are tied. In testimony to Congress this week, Patel described Acosta’s handling of the case as the “original sin” in the Epstein investigation, arguing the ex-U.S. attorney’s agreement with Epstein and the narrow scope of the government’s investigation at the time have resulted in the government not being able to release some documents and being hamstrung in what they can investigate going forward. Democrats have criticized Patel’s excuses, however, arguing the government has not taken any steps to try to have more documents released.Further ReadingForbesHere’s What Jeffrey Epstein Was Accused Of, Convicted For—And The New QuestionsBy Zachary FolkForbesCan FBI Release Full Epstein Files?
