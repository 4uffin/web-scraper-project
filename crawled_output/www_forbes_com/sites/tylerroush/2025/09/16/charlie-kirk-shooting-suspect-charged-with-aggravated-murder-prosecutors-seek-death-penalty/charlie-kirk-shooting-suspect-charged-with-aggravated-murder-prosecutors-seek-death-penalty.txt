Ty Roush is a breaking news reporter based in New York City.Follow AuthorSep 16, 2025, 02:25pm EDTSep 16, 2025, 03:50pm EDTShareSaveCommentAdd Us On GoogleToplineTyler Robinson, the suspect accused of fatally shooting conservative activist Charlie Kirk, was charged Tuesday with aggravated murder after Robinson reportedly confessed to the attack in online messages and turned himself in to law enforcement. President Donald Trump has called for the suspect to face the death penalty. Associated PressKey FactsRobinson, 22, faces charges of aggravated murder, felony discharge of a firearm causing serious bodily harm, two counts of obstruction of justice, two counts of witness tampering and commission of a violence offense in the presence of a child, Utah County attorney Jeff Gray announced Tuesday.Gray said he would seek the death penalty for Robinson in the case.Gray alleged Robinson directed his romantic partner he lived with to delete text messages and “stay silent if police questioned him.”In an accompanying court filing, prosecutors said DNA “consistent with” Robinson was found on the trigger of the rifle believed to have been used in the shooting.The filing alleged that Robinson disclosed in a text message to his romantic partner that he “had enough of his hatred,” referring to Kirk after the attack, adding, “Some hate can’t be negotiated out.”Gray said that response prompted the person to ask, “You weren’t the one who did it right????” before Robinson responded, “I am, I’m sorry.”What To Watch ForRobinson is scheduled to make his first court appearance at 5 p.m. EDT for a preliminary hearing, according to the Utah County Attorney’s office.Key BackgroundRobinson was taken into custody last week after he suggested to a family member he had fatally shot Kirk, who appeared at Utah Valley University as part of a nationwide tour, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said. The Washington Post reported Monday that Robinson messaged friends in a group chat on Sept. 11, a day after the shooting, indicating “it was me at UVU yesterday” and that he would soon surrender to a “sheriff friend.” FBI Director Kash Patel said DNA evidence recovered near the shooting was “positively processed” for Robinson, and that Robinson had written a note which read, “I have the opportunity to take out Charlie Kirk and I’m going to take it.” Officials have yet to reveal a motive in the attack, though Trump has claimed the “radical left” was “directly responsible” for Kirk’s death, and Vice President JD Vance has said “left-wing extremism” is “part of the reason” Kirk was killed.What Do We Know About Tyler Robinson?Robinson grew up in Washington County in southwestern Utah, about 260 miles south of the shooting location. He attended Utah State University for one semester in 2021 and was a pre-engineering major, the university told Forbes in a statement. Robinson was a third-year student in an electrical apprenticeship program at Dixie Technical College in St. George, Utah, a spokesperson for Utah Valley University told CNN. He lived with a roommate whom Cox identified as a “boyfriend who is transitioning from male to female,” and noted this person was “very cooperative with authorities.” A family member told law enforcement that Robinson had “become more political in recent years,” though before that had appeared to be a “very normal young man, a very smart young man,” Cox said. Voting records indicate Robinson was unaffiliated with any party and that he was considered “inactive,” suggesting he did not vote in the 2024 presidential election. Cox said Robinson came from a conservative family, but his “ideology was very different from his family.”Further ReadingForbesCharlie Kirk’s Suspected Killer Texted About Chance To ‘Take Out’ Conservative Activist, FBI Chief SaysBy Ty RoushGot a tip?
