Ty Roush is a breaking news reporter based in New York City.Follow AuthorSep 12, 2025, 08:26am EDTSep 12, 2025, 09:03am EDTShareSaveCommentAdd Us On GoogleToplinePresident Donald Trump on Friday said a suspect in the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk was in custody, following a dayslong manhunt in which previous suspects were arrested and released. “I think, with a high degree of certainty, we have him in custody,” Trump said. Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reservedKey Facts“I think, with a high degree of certainty, we have him in custody,” Trump said in a Fox News appearance Friday morning.An arrest was made after law enforcement received a tip from a minister who recognized the suspect from images released by authorities, Trump said, adding the suspect’s father was also involved in their capture.Trump, who said he was notified of the suspect’s arrest moments earlier, said “somebody that was very close” to the suspect turned them in and cautioned his information was “subject to be corrected.”When asked if the suspect was involved in a broader plot, Trump said it “seems to be” a one-off incident, but suggested it was unclear as an investigation continued.Trump indicated he wanted the suspect in custody to get the death penalty, if they are found guilty: “He’s going to be found guilty, I would imagine.”What Do We Know About The Suspect?A man was taken into custody around 11 p.m. local time Thursday by Utah state and local police in St. George, Utah, near Zion National Park, the New York Times reported, citing a law enforcement official who confirmed Trump’s comments. The suspect is in his early 20s and is a Utah resident, NBC News reported, citing two senior law enforcement officials. Other details about the suspect are unknown, however, as the official said the person’s name would not be released as officials pursued leads and executed search warrants. The FBI on Thursday released details about the suspect’s clothing in addition to surveillance footage, which appeared to show a suspect wearing a T-shirt with an American flag, black shoes and a black hat.This is a developing story.Got a tip?
