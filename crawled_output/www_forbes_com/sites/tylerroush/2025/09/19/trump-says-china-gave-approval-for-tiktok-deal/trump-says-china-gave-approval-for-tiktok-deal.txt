Ty Roush is a breaking news reporter based in New York City.Follow AuthorSep 19, 2025, 12:03pm EDTSep 19, 2025, 01:27pm EDTShareSaveCommentAdd Us On GoogleToplinePresident Donald Trump on Friday said Chinese President Xi Jinping gave “approval” for a deal that would keep TikTok online in the U.S., though Trump did not offer additional details on the talks. A deal is expected to include a controlling stake for billionaire Larry Ellison and Marc Andreessen’s capital venture firm.NurPhoto via Getty ImagesKey FactsTrump, writing on Truth Social following a phone call with Xi, said he and Xi “made progress on many very important issues” and specifically thanked Xi for “the TikTok approval.”
In a statement through the Chinese foreign ministry, Xi said he addressed negotiations over the sale of TikTok with Trump and noted the Chinese government “respects corporate decisions and welcomes business negotiations that follow market rules and produce solutions consistent with Chinese laws and balanced interests.”Xi requested Trump to avoid imposing “unilateral trade restrictions” on China during the call, according to the statement.Earlier this week, Trump claimed, “We have a deal on TikTok,” and suggested he would speak with Xi on Friday to “confirm everything up,” adding on Thursday their talks would be “to see if we can finalize something on TikTok because there is tremendous value.”What Do We Know About The Tiktok Deal?Treasury Scott Bessent said Monday trade negotiators from the U.S. and China had agreed on a “framework” for a deal on TikTok that would shift the company to “U.S.-controlled ownership.” Li Chenggang, China’s leading trade representative, said in a statement Tuesday the U.S. and China agreed on a “framework consensus on resolving issues related to TikTok through cooperation, reducing investment barriers and promoting relevant economic and trade cooperation.” Jamieson Greer, the U.S. trade representative, said agreed terms were “fair for the Chinese” and respected national security concerns in the U.S., though neither Greer nor Li offered specifics. A consortium of investors will reportedly hold a roughly 80% stake as part of the deal, headlined by Larry Ellison’s Oracle, Marc Andreessen’s venture capital firm and the private equity Silver Lake. The new entity will have a board primarily consisting of Americans and one member designated by the U.S. government, people familiar with the matter told the Wall Street Journal. What To Watch ForTrump said he would meet with Xi during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea in November, marking what would be their first in-person meeting since June 2019. He noted he would visit China “in the early part of next year,” and that Xi would “come to the United States at an appropriate time.” Xi previously visited the U.S. in November 2023 during a meeting with former President Joe Biden in California.Key BackgroundA ban on TikTok in the U.S. was approved by Congress in April 2024, following bipartisan concerns the China-based social media app posed national security threats. Trump has delayed a deadline for ByteDance, TikTok’s parent firm, to divest from the app or have TikTok go dark in the U.S. The app was briefly pulled in the U.S. in January, shortly after the Supreme Court upheld the ban, though it returned following assurances from Trump that he would try to save the app. Trump has repeatedly said several companies have been presented as potential suitors, including Microsoft and a “group of very wealthy people.” Further ReadingForbesOracle, Andreessen Horowitz, More Will Hold Controlling Stake In TikTok Deal, Report SaysBy Ty RoushForbesTrump Suggests TikTok ‘Deal’ Reached With China —What To KnowBy Alison DurkeeGot a tip?
