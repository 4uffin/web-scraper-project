He took further jabs at Trump and FBI Director Kash Patel and their reactions to Kirk’s assassination.What Did Kimmel Say In His Return Monologue?Kimmel addressed comments made regarding Kirk, telling his audience, “You understand it was never my intention to make light of the murder of a young man…I don’t think there’s anything funny about it.” The host also said it was not his intention to blame any particular people for the assassination and that he was trying to make the opposite point, telling those who thought he pointed a finger, “I get why you’re upset…If the situation were reversed, there’s a good chance I would’ve felt the same way.” Kimmel said he does not think Kirk’s suspected killer “represents anyone.” The late night host blasted FCC chairman Brendan Carr and Trump in the monologue.What To Watch ForTrump was not happy with Kimmel’s return and threatened to sue ABC after it brought the late night host back. The president said his lawsuit would target alleged campaign finance law violations and falsely claimed Kimmel was “yet another arm of the DNC.” Legal experts have cast significant doubt on Trump’s chances in court.Key BackgroundKimmel’s show was removed by ABC hours after Carr told right-wing podcast Benny Jonhson in a podcast appearance, “We can do this the easy way or the hard way," threatening Kimmel directly and adding “These companies can find ways to change conduct to take action on Kimmel or, you know, there's going to be additional work for the FCC ahead." ABC later said “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” would be preempted indefinitely, with Sinclair and Nexstar, the latter of which will need FCC approval to complete its $6.2 billion acquisition of fellow broadcaster TEGNA, following suit on the suspension of Kimmel on their ABC affiliate stations. Democrats are demanding information about communications the FCC may have had with ABC about Kimmel’s suspension, alleging Carr’s comments about Kimmel amount to a “broad pattern of government coercion of the press.”Further ReadingJimmy Kimmel Calls Out FCC Chair And Trump As He Returns To ABC (Forbes)Kimmel’s Monologue Draws Millions On YouTube Amid Ban By Some ABC Stations (Forbes)ABC Pulls Jimmy Kimmel ‘Indefinitely’ After Charlie Kirk Comments: Here’s What He Said (Forbes)Got a tip?
