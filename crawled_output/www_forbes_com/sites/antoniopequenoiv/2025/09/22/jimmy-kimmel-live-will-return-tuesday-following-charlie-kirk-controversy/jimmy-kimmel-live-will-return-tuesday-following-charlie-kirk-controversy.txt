(Photo by Randy Holmes/Disney via Getty Images)Disney via Getty ImagesKey FactsDisney said it reached the decision to return the show after “having thoughtful conversations” with Kimmel.Disney wrote it suspended Kimmel’s show “to avoid further inflaming a tense situation at an emotional moment for our country,” noting it “felt some of the comments were ill-timed and thus insensitive.”The decision follows intense scrutiny from top Democrats like former President Barack Obama, Hollywood stars, and major public figures including former Disney CEO Michael Eisner, who seemingly blasted current Disney CEO Bob Iger when he tweeted, “Where has all the leadership gone?”Kimmel and Disney gathered last week in a meeting that ended in a stalemate, according to The Hollywood Reporter, with the talk show host not intent on apologizing for his monologue as he believed his comments were “grossly mischaracterized.”It is not immediately clear if Nexstar and Sinclair, two broadcasters that removed Kimmel’s show from a bulk of ABC affiliate stations they respectively own, will allow the show to air again Tuesday.Sinclair demanded an apology from Kimmel to Kirk’s family and a “meaningful personal donation to the Kirk Family and Turning Point USA,” the conservative nonprofit Kirk led.Forbes has reached out to Nexstar and Sinclair for comment.This is a developing story.
