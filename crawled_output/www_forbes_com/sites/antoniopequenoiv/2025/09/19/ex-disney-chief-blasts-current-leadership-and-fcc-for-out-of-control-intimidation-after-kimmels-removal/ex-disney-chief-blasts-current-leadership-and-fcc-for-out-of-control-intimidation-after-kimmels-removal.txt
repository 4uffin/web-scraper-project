Pequeño is a breaking news reporter who covers tech and more.Follow AuthorSep 19, 2025, 04:08pm EDTSep 19, 2025, 05:39pm EDTShareSaveCommentAdd Us On GoogleToplineFormer Disney CEO Michael Eisner seemed to blast successor Bob Iger in a tweet Friday, calling out those who aren’t “standing up to bullies” amid government threats to the First Amendment after Disney’s ABC seemed to cave to threats by the Trump administration by removing talk show host Jimmy Kimmel.Eisner made the comments in a tweet posted Friday. (Photo by JC Olivera/Sportico via Getty Images)Sportico via Getty ImagesKey FactsEisner said Kimmel’s indefinite suspension “immediately after” FCC chairman Brendan Carr made threats against ABC “is yet another example of out-of-control intimidation.” Eisner seemed to refer to comments Carr made in an appearance on a right-wing podcast on Wednesday, when the FCC chair noted remarks Kimmel made about Kirk—specifically about MAGA supporters and Trump’s response to his death—and said, “These companies can find ways to take action on Kimmel or there is going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.”Hours after Carr’s comments, ABC announced “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” would be pulled off the air.Eisner, who mentioned the Trump administration’s attacks against higher education, law firms and major corporations, asked, “Where has all the leadership gone?” a seeming jab at Iger.Forbes has reached out to Disney for comment.Get Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We’re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day’s headlines. Text “Alerts” to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here.News PegDuring his monologue during Monday’s episode of “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” he said, “We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it.” He then showed a video of Trump seeming to breeze by a reporter’s question about Kirk to enthuse about construction of a new White House ballroom. Carr made threats against Kimmel on Wednesday, noting broadcasters “have a license granted by us at the FCC, and that comes with it an obligation to operate in the public interest.” Not long after, ABC said Kimmel’s show would be “pre-empted indefinitely.” Broadcasters Nexstar and Sinclair, which respectively own several ABC-affiliated stations, separately announced they would not air the show. “While this may be an unprecedented decision, it is important for broadcasters to push back on Disney programming that they determine falls short of community,” Carr said in response to the decisions from Nexstar and Sinclair. What To Watch ForWhile ABC has not indicated it intends to bring back Kimmel anytime soon, Trump suggested Thursday television networks with shows critical of him should “maybe” have their licenses taken away. Networks like ABC are not licensed by the FCC, rather, the FCC provides licenses to broadcasters like Sinclair that own affiliated stations. The president also claimed all evening shows do is “hit Trump,” adding, “They’re licensed. They’re not allowed to do that.”Claims Of Jawboning—fcc Accused Of Bending Media Companies To Its WillLegal experts have sounded the alarm on “jawboning,” which refers to “the use of official speech to inappropriately compel private action,” according to the Cato Institute. While the practice has been loosely defined, the Supreme Court has said in multiple instances it can be unlawful and a threat to First Amendment rights. Critics of the FCC have accused it and Carr of coercing media companies into falling in line with Trump’s agenda, pointing to instances like the FCC’s approval of Skydance Media’s acquisition of Paramount, which was approved after Paramount subsidiary CBS settled a lawsuit with Trump for $16 million. Carr suggested last year the lawsuit, which Paramount once called, “completely without merit,” could factor into Paramount and Skydance’s merger. Skydance also made commitments to remove diversity, equity and inclusion considerations in its hiring and employment practices, receiving praise from Carr, who said the commitments were “another step forward in the FCC’s efforts to eliminate invidious forms of DEI discrimination.” Similarly, Nexstar needs FCC approval to acquire Tegna. After the broadcaster announced it would not air Kimmel, Carr thanked it for “doing the right thing.”Key BackgroundEisner is one of several notable figures to scrutinize ABC and the Trump administration over Kimmel’s removal. California Gov. Gavin Newsom said the Trump administration’s war against the media amounted to the GOP not believing in free speech, saying in a tweet, “They are censoring you in real time.” Late-night hosts Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert, Seth Meyers and Jimmy Fallon have also come out to support Kimmel. Colbert said the matter was “blatant censorship,” telling viewers this week, “With an autocrat, you cannot give an inch.” Further ReadingTrump Says Licenses Should ‘Maybe’ Be Pulled From Networks He Claims Are Critical Of Him (Forbes)‘Blatant Censorship’: Late Night Hosts React To Kimmel Being Taken Off Air (Forbes)Got a tip?
