Pequeño is a breaking news reporter who covers tech and more.Follow AuthorSep 11, 2025, 07:21pm EDTSep 11, 2025, 08:00pm EDTShareSaveCommentToplineThe U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, was locked down Thursday after it received threats—hours after at least eight historically Black colleges and the Democratic National Committee also faced threats—though Maryland Gov. Wes Moore’s office recently said the threats were not “ credible” WBAL-TV reported.The lockdown was issued Thursday evening. flickr Editorial/Getty ImagesKey FactsThe city of Annapolis said in a statement that Naval Support Activity Annapolis and law enforcement responded to “reports of threats made to the Naval Academy,” noting the base was locked down “out of an abundance of caution.”Moore’s office told WBAL-TV, "In working with local, state, and federal law enforcement authorities, there is currently no credible threat to the Naval Academy.”Forbes has reached out to Moore’s office and the Naval Academy for comment.TangentThreats were also made to several Historically Black Colleges and Universities on Thursday, prompting the schools to issue lockdowns and shelter-in-place orders. While several of those orders were lifted into Thursday evening, classes and extracurricular activities remain canceled for some of the universities until Monday. Law enforcement near and at the Democratic National Convention headquarters and the University of Massachusetts Boston also responded to threats Thursday, with neither resulting in injuries or deaths.Key BackgroundThe influx of threats against educational institutions Thursday follows the shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University on Wednesday. Kirk, who was speaking in front of a large crowd at the university’s amphitheater, was killed after he appeared to be shot in the neck. President Donald Trump spoke kindly of Kirk in a video statement and said “radical left political violence has hurt too many innocent people and taken too many lives.” A suspect in the shooting has yet to be detained by local law enforcement or the FBI, though photos of the suspected shooter, whose motives are currently unknown, were released Thursday.Further ReadingCharlie Kirk Shooting: Photo Of Person Of Interest Released (Live Updates) (Forbes)Got a tip?
