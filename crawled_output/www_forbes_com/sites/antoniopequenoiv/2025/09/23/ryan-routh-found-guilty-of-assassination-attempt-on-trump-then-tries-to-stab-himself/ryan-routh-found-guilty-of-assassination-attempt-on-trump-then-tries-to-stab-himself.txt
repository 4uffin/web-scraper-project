Routh has prior convictions dating back several years. In 2002, he was convicted of possession of a weapon of mass destruction, a count linked to an incident in which he reportedly engaged in a stand-off with Greensboro police while barricading himself inside a business with a fully automatic machine gun. He was also convicted of multiple counts of possession of stolen goods in 2010. Routh appeared to have voted for Trump in 2016, though he later donated a cumulative $140 in 2019 and 2020 to Democratic fundraising organization ActBlue. He has also voiced support for former Democratic congresswoman and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, and former Republican presidential candidates Vivek Ramaswamy and Nikki Haley, according to the BBC.Key BackgroundRouth attempted to assassinate Trump last year at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida, less than two months before Election Day. According to trial evidence, Routh was spotted by a Secret Service member patrolling one hole ahead of Trump. The agent saw Routh in possession of a weapon and opened fire at him, causing Routh to flee. Routh was later apprehended after driving away from the scene, where law enforcement found a rifle equipped with a scope, steel armor plates and a camera pointed at the sixth hole. Routh’s assassination attempt against Trump came just two months after the president was shot in a separate attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania. The shooter, Thomas Crooks, was killed by the Secret Service after firing at Trump.Further ReadingHere’s What We Know About The Suspect In Trump Assassination Attempt (Forbes)Got a tip?
