(Photo by Randy Holmes/Disney via Getty Images)Disney via Getty ImagesKey FactsDisney said it reached the decision to return the show after “having thoughtful conversations” with Kimmel.Disney wrote it suspended Kimmel’s show “to avoid further inflaming a tense situation at an emotional moment for our country,” noting it “felt some of the comments were ill-timed and thus insensitive.”The decision follows intense scrutiny from top Democrats like former President Barack Obama, Hollywood stars, and major public figures including former Disney CEO Michael Eisner, who seemingly blasted current Disney CEO Bob Iger when he tweeted, “Where has all the leadership gone?”Kimmel and Disney gathered last week in a meeting that ended in a stalemate, according to The Hollywood Reporter, with the talk show host not intent on apologizing for his monologue as he believed his comments were “grossly mischaracterized.”What Have Affiliate Station Owners Sinclair And Nexstar Said?Sinclair Broadcast Group announced it will preempt Kimmel’s show on its ABC affiliate stations when it returns to air on Tuesday. In a statement, the company said: “Beginning Tuesday night, Sinclair will be preempting Jimmy Kimmel Live! across our ABC affiliate stations and replacing it with news programming. Discussions with ABC are ongoing as we evaluate the show’s potential return.” Sinclair controls 39 ABC-affiliated stations across the country, which means the preemption could significantly limit the show’s viewership. Previously, Sinclair had demanded an apology from Kimmel to Kirk’s family and a “meaningful personal donation to the Kirk Family and Turning Point USA,” the conservative group Kirk led. Nexstar, which announced it was preempting the late-night show from its ABC affiliate stations last week—before Disney paused the show’s production—has not commented on the Kimmel’s Tuesday return.How Did Late-Night Hosts React To Kimmel’s Reinstatement?Kimmel’s late-night host colleagues spoke up in support of him last week and described his show’s suspension as censorship. On Monday night, Daily Show Host Jon Stewart addressed Kimmel’s return to cheers from his audience, before joking: “That campaign that you all launched, pretending that you were going to cancel Hulu while secretly racing through four seasons of Only Murders in the Building, that really worked, congratulations.” Stewart then said: “It was rather shocking that this turnaround occurred, because I was told that the original decision to get rid of Jimmy had nothing to do with the Trump administration and their explicit FCC threat that they could remove the show the easy way or the hard way.” Later in the segment, Stewart continued to criticize the president, saying: “You don’t have to bend over backwards trying to make Trump’s authoritarian power grabs seem like the rule of law. He does not give a fuck anymore. He’s saying it straight-up.” Stephen Colbert, the host of “The Late Show,” opened his monologue saying: “Our long national late nightmare is over because Disney announced that Jimmy Kimmel Live will return to air on ABC tomorrow, Tuesday night.” Colbert then quipped “now that Jimmy's not being cancelled, I get to enjoy this again,” holding up the Emmy his show won last week. “Once more, I am the only martyr in late night…Wait, unless CBS you want to announce anything? Still no?”What Did Kimmel Say That Got Him Suspended?“We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it,” Kimmel said in a monologue last week. The host also made a joke about a video clip in which Trump was asked how he felt the day after Kirk’s assassination, saying to a reporter, “I think very good” before quickly diverting the conversation to construction on the White House’s ballroom project. “He’s at the fourth stage of grief, construction,” Kimmel said. “This is not how an adult grieves the murder of someone he called a friend. This is how a four-year-old mourns a goldfish.”TangentDisney shares rose following the news of Kimmel’s return before leveling back out in after-hours trading. The conglomerate’s stock is down 2.6% in the last five days of trading, which include the day Kimmel’s show was suspended.Key BackgroundKimmel’s suspension was announced hours after FCC chairman Brendan Carr told right-wing podcaster Benny Johnson he could take action against the show, saying, “We can do this the easy way or the hard way.” Hours later, ABC announced the suspension, along with Nexstar and Sinclair. Nexstar will need FCC approval to secure its planned $6.2 billion acquisition of broadcast company TEGNA. Carr thanked Nexstar for “doing the right thing” and said, “While this may be an unprecedented decision, it is important for broadcasters to push back on Disney programming that they determine falls short of community.” Earlier this summer, the FCC approved the merger between CBS parent company Paramount and Skydance after CBS settled a $16 million lawsuit from Trump and Skydance vowed to remove diversity, equity, and inclusion considerations from its business practices. Skydance also agreed to examine allegations of bias surrounding CBS News, receiving praise from Carr, who said “Americans no longer trust the legacy national news media to report fully, accurately, and fairly.”Further ReadingABC Pulls Jimmy Kimmel ‘Indefinitely’ After Charlie Kirk Comments: Here’s What He Said (Forbes)Ex-Disney Chief Blasts Current Leadership And FCC For ‘Out-Of-Control Intimidation’ After Kimmel’s Removal (Forbes)Hollywood Stars Backing Kimmel: Stern, Streep, Hanks ‘The View’ Hosts, More (Forbes)Got a tip?
