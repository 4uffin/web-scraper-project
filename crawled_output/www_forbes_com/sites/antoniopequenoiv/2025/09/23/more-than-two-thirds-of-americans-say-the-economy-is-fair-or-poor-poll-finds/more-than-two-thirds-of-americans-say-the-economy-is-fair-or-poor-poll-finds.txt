(Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)Getty ImagesKey FactsIn the poll, which surveyed 1,551 U.S. adults between Sept. 19 and Sept. 22, 35% of Americans described the economy as “poor,” while 32% described it as “fair.”The share of respondents who described the economy as “good” was 24% while 4% described it as “excellent.”Respondents aged 18-29 represented the age group with the most critical view of the economy, with 69% saying the economy is either in fair (32%) or poor condition (37%).Nearly 75% of respondents making less than $50,000 per year consider the economy fair (32%) or poor (41%), while an equal number (33%) of those making $50,000 to $100,000 per year consider it fair or poor.The poll follows the Fed’s decision last week to lower interest rates by a quarter-point to between 4% and 4.25%.The Federal Open Market Committee also said it expects to make two additional rate cuts by the end of the year amid concerns of a weakening labor market.Get Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We’re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day’s headlines.

That is the share of Americans who believe the economy is getting worse, more than double the amount of respondents who felt the same way at the start of President Donald Trump’s second term, according to the Economist/YouGov poll.What Is The Inflation Rate?Consumer prices jumped 0.2% from July to August, when the inflation rate reached 2.9%. Core consumer prices, which excludes food and energy markets, increased 3.1% annually and 0.3% from July to August.Key BackgroundFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said during an address Tuesday that the weakening labor market was a factor in cutting interest rates, noting “near-term risks” to inflation are “tilted to the upside,” while employment risks are up and have impacted the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy. The unemployment rate reached 4.3% in August, placing above economists’ forecasts of 4.2%. Powell, who did not indicate any further cuts for October, said the latest interest rate cut leaves the U.S. “well-positioned” to respond to economic developments. Trump’s sweeping tariff policies have contributed to the rising inflation rate, with Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch Ratings, saying in a note this month Trump’s tariffs are impacting consumer prices “slowly—quite slowly, in fact.”Further ReadingUnemployment Hits 4.3%—Worse Than Expected (Forbes)Inflation Jumped Again In August As Interest Rate Meeting Looms (Forbes)Fed’s Powell Cites Weakening Job Market For Interest Rate Cut (Forbes)Got a tip?
