Zinn was taken to the university’s police department and later transported to a local hospital after he experienced a medical episode, the nature of which was not specified by the sheriff’s office.Utah County Sheriff’s Office said Zinn, while at the hospital, stated he falsely claimed to be the shooter to obstruct local law enforcement’s response to the assassination.Law enforcement said there is no information that Zinn colluded with the suspected shooter, Tyler Robinson, who was charged Tuesday in connection to Kirk’s assassination.Zinn also allowed law enforcement agents to look at his phone, which contained sexually explicit material of minors.The sheriff's office said Zinn admitted to investigators that he “gets sexual gratification from viewing and sharing” the images, “and that his preferred victim age is five to 12 years old.”Zinn is still in custody and is being held on suspicion of felony counts of obstruction of justice and sexual exploitation of a minor.Court records have not named an attorney for Zinn as of Tuesday afternoon, NBC News reported.Get Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We’re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day’s headlines.
