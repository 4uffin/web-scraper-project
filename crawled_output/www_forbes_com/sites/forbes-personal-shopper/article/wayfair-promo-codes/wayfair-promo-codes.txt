Browse The Deals Of The Day Section
Wayfair’s Deals Of The Day section is full of rare discounts across all categories. The catch? They’re only live for 24 hours. Right now, the section is full of notable markdowns on seasonal décor and outdoor furniture, as well living room pieces like sofas and coffee tables.
Mark Your Calendar For Way Day Sales
Way Day is when you’ll find Wayfair’s lowest prices of the year. It started off as a three-day sale in the spring, featuring sitewide savings of up to 80%. In recent years, the retailer has also started running a fall Way Day sale in October, so keep your eye out for the announcement of this year’s dates. During Way Day, you can typically also find limited-time flash deals across the site. It’s essentially Wayfair’s version of Amazon Prime Day.
