Our sleep editors curate these lists after personally testing dozens of beds (they’ve tested over 90 so far this year), so the fact that Nectar’s models are recommended in multiple truly speaks to their quality.

Check Out The Nectar Premier Mattress
After personally testing multiple memory foam mattresses and collecting additional feedback from testers with a variety of body types and sleep styles, our mattress and sleep editor Bridget Chapman named the Nectar Premier the best memory foam mattress overall. With a medium-firm feel, a cooling cover and great motion isolation, it’s an option that’ll appeal to a variety of sleepers. Our sleep team also named it the best memory foam mattress for couples thanks to the aforementioned motion isolation and its ability to accommodate multiple sleep styles.
Take Advantage Of The 365-Night Trial
One of Nectar’s biggest perks is its 365-night trial. When you order a Nectar mattress, you have a full year to see if it’s the right fit. That’s far longer than what most brands offer, with many other leading brands capping their trials at 100 nights. If you decide you need to return your bed within that time period, Nectar will give you a full refund and help you find a place to donate the mattress.
Think About Using Your HSA Or FSA Funds To Shop At Nectar
If you have an HSA or FSA, you could be able to use those pre-tax funds toward eligible Nectar products. At checkout, choose Truemed as your payment option, complete a quick questionnaire and then you’ll be prompted to pay with your HSA or FSA card for the portion of your cart that qualifies. Just keep in mind that you can’t typically use your HSA or FSA to pay for an entire mattress—up to 90% of the bed’s cost is eligible if you qualify.
Frequently Asked Questions About Nectar Coupons
Does Nectar Let You Stack Coupons?
No, Nectar doesn’t allow coupon stacking.
What Is Nectar’s Return Policy?
Nectar gives you a full 365 nights to try out your mattress at home. If it’s not the right fit, you can send it back for a full refund—return shipping included. To start the process, just reach out to customer service and file a return request. Opened mattresses in good condition can be returned between 30 and 365 days after delivery, while unopened ones can be returned right away. Just note: If a mattress sits unopened for more than 90 days, Nectar considers it misused and it won’t qualify for a return.

Yes, Nectar provides free shipping within the contiguous U.S. White glove delivery is available for an additional fee, which includes in-home setup and removal of your old mattress.
Does Nectar Offer A Student Discount?

Does Nectar Offer A Military Discount?
Yes, Nectar offers a 5% military discount to service members, veterans, retirees and their spouses and dependents. The one-time offer generally applies to full-price items and can’t be combined with other promotions.
Does Nectar Have A Referral Program?
Yes. Nectar’s referral program allows customers to earn rewards by sharing a unique referral link. Friends receive a $100 discount on their first purchase, and the referrer gets a $100 Amazon gift card once the sale is complete.
