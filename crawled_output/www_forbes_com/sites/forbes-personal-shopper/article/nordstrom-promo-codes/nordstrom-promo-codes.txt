Forbes VettedDealsFashionThe Best Nordstrom Promo Codes And Deals: Up To 80% Off Hoka, Barbour And MoreByBianca Alvarez I've been covering the best deals and sales for over two years. Reviewed ByKara Cuzzone,Supervising Editor, Deals & Coupons.Follow AuthorsSep 24, 2025, 07:07pm EDTShareSaveAdd Us On GoogleWith Nordstrom’s Fall Savings Event in full swing, it’s a good time to find deals at the department store. In fact, right now you can find discounts on some of our editors’ favorite products like the best Hoka running shoes for tempo runs (the Hoka Mach 6), and the best microcurrent device (the NuFace Trinity+). To help you get straight to the best offers, I’ve complied a list of the best Nordstrom promo codes and deals available this week.

Sign Up For The Nordy Club
The Nordy Club is Nordstrom’s free rewards program. Signing up gets you free shipping on all orders, the ability to earn points which convert into Nordstrom Notes (a.k.a. rewards cash) and birthday perks. Every $1 you spend nets you one point—and for every 1,000 points you accumulate, you can get a $10 credit on your order.
The Nordy Club is a tiered rewards program, meaning you can unlock special perks based on the amount of money you spend at the department store each year. When you spend $500 in one year, your status changes from Member to Influencer. After spending $5,000 in a single year, you become an Ambassador, which comes with even more perks including access to invite-only events. To reach the highest tier with the most perks and become an Icon, you have to spend $15,000 or more at the department store in a year using a Nordstrom credit card.
Mark Your Calendar For The Nordstrom Anniversary Sale
While Nordstrom runs smaller sales throughout the year, its summer Anniversary Sale is the best time to save across all categories. During the sale, we typically see discounts of up to 50% (or in some cases, more) on top-rated brands like Rothy’s, Charlotte Tilbury, Hoka and AllSaints. The Anniversary Sale recently ended in August, but the next Half-Yearly Sale should arrive in December. The Half-Yearly Sale is a similar (albeit smaller) event.
Think About Applying For A Nordstrom Credit Card
If you’re a frequent Nordstrom shopper, applying for a Nordstrom Credit Card could be worth doing. As a cardholder, you get exclusive early access to the Nordstrom Anniversary Sale and earn at least two points on all purchases you make at the department store, as well as points on non-Nordstrom purchases. You can then exchange those points for Nordstrom Notes to save on future big-ticket purchases. Right now, if you’re approved for the card you’ll also get a $40 Nordstrom Note to use toward your next purchase.
Frequently Asked Questions About Nordstrom Promo Codes
Does Nordstrom Let You Stack Coupons?
No, Nordstrom doesn’t allow coupon stacking.
What Is Nordstrom’s Return Policy?
Nordstrom states that it handles returns on a case-by-case basis to meet its customers’ needs. That said, it offers free returns on most items. You can make your return in person or request a prepaid shipping label online to process your return by mail. While you can return most items at a Nordstrom or Nordstrom Rack store, there is an exception for jewelry and designer products—these can’t be returned at Nordstrom Rack unless they were purchased there.
Does Nordstrom Offer Free Shipping?
Yes, Nordstrom offers free standard shipping on almost everything. If you need your item faster, you can opt for expedited shipping for an additional cost.
Does Nordstrom Offer A Student Discount?
No, Nordstrom doesn’t offer a student discount.
Does Nordstrom Offer A Military Discount?
Nordstrom doesn’t currently offer a military discount.
Does Nordstrom Have A Referral Program?
No, Nordstrom doesn’t have a referral program.
Does Nordstrom Price Match?
Yes, Nordstrom does price match. If Nordstrom or one of its select competitors (like Amazon or Bloomingdale’s) marks down an item you’ve purchased within 10 days of its shipment date, you can request a price adjustment online or in-store. Some products are excluded from price matching, like Anniversary Sale deals and Beauty Daily Deals promotions. You can read through all of the price matching guidelines in Nordstrom’s Pricing Policy.
Does Nordstrom Give A Birthday Discount?
Yes, Nordstrom offers a birthday discount (referred to as a Birthday Perk) to Nordy Club members. To qualify for the reward, you must be a member of the loyalty club and have your birthday information linked to your account at least 30 days before your birthday month.
