Forbes VettedDealsGearThe Best REI Promo Codes And Deals Our Editors Found This WeekByKara Cuzzone,Supervising Editor, Deals & CouponsandBrianna LapollaFollow AuthorsSep 17, 2025, 05:38pm EDTShareSaveAdd Us On GoogleWhenever I need outdoor gear—whether for a National Park trip or a weekend hike—REI is always my first stop. The retailer carries top-quality apparel and supplies across every category, including our gear editor’s pick for the best workout shoes for women (the On Cloud X 4).

Save By Signing Up For The REI Co-Op Membership
If you’re a frequent REI shopper, an REI Co-op membership is an investment that’ll quickly pay for itself. For a one-time fee of $30, you’ll get 10% back annually on most REI purchases, plus access to exclusive deals and extra discounts during events like the Anniversary Sale and Member Sale. You’ll also get free shipping on all orders.
Mark Your Calendar For REI’s Biggest Sales Of The Year
The Anniversary Sale is the REI’s biggest sale of the year. It usually happens in May and runs for about 10 days. This year’s sale included 30% off brands like Salomon, Brooks, Garmin and Hydro Flask, plus member exclusives like 20% off one full-priced item and one REI Outlet pick.
REI also runs a handful of other sales throughout the year. The next major one is the Winter Sale, which is set to return in early to mid November. Other than that, the gear store typically runs a Member Sale in the spring and a Fourth of July event in the summer.
Shop The REI Outlet For Extra Savings
One of the easiest ways to find good REI deals is by browsing the Outlet. There, you’ll find thousands of sneakers, clothes, accessories and other gear from past seasons at a fraction of their original cost. I recommend filtering the Outlet page by category and by brand to make it easier to find hidden gems.
Frequently Asked Questions About REI Promo Codes
Does REI Let You Stack Coupons?
No, REI doesn’t typically let you stack coupons.
Can You Use An REI Coupon Twice?
No, you can only use an REI coupon code for one transaction.
What Is REI’s Return Policy?
REI has a very forgiving return policy. Non-members have a 90-day window to send in most returns, while REI Co-op members can return items for a replacement or refund for up to one year. There are some exceptions to this rule though, including final sale items and used products. Read all of REI’s return policy details before making your purchase to see how you’re covered.
Does REI Offer Free Shipping?
Yes, REI offers free standard shipping on purchases over $60. Orders under that minimum have a $7.99 shipping fee. REI Co-Op members qualify for free shipping with no minimum—the only exception is oversized items.
Do REI Members Get 10% Off?
REI Co-op members don’t get 10% off all purchases. That said, they do earn an annual 10% Co-op reward on eligible full-price purchases. The reward comes in the form of a credit to use toward future purchases, and is usually distributed once a year in March. There’s also typically a time limit to use it. For instance, 2024 rewards were added to member accounts in March 2025 and expire on January 3, 2027.
Can I Shop At REI Co-op Without A Membership?
Yes, anyone can shop at REI. However, with a membership you may be able to shop special deals throughout the year. Members of REI’s rewards program typically receive access to exclusive benefits and perks, including special promo codes during events like the REI Anniversary Sale.
Does REI Offer A Military Discount?
No, REI doesn’t currently offer an individual military discount.
Does REI Offer A Student Discount?
No, REI doesn’t offer a student discount.
