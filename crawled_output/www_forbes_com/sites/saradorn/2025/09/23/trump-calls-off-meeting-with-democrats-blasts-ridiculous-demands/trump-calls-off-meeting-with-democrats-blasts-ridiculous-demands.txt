(Photo by SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images)AFP via Getty ImagesKey FactsTrump was expected to meet Thursday with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y. and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., who wrote to Trump Saturday requesting the meeting. Trump called off the sitdown in a Truth Social post Tuesday, writing, “I have decided that no meeting with their Congressional Leaders could possibly be productive.”Republicans want to pass what’s known as a continuing resolution that would extend the current budget plan past the shutdown deadline for seven more weeks, but Democrats proposed a funding package through Oct. 31 that tacks on a list of new provisions.At the top of Democrats’ list is a proposal to permanently extend Obamacare subsidies that are set to expire at the end of the year, limit the Trump administration’s ability to reverse funding Congress has already approved and provide more security funding for lawmakers than what Republicans proposed. Chief Critics“Trump Always Chickens Out,” Jeffries tweeted in response to Trump cancelling the meeting, a reference to the “TACO Trump” acronym critics of his tariff reversals have adopted. Schumer said in a statement: “While Americans face rising costs and a Republican healthcare crisis, Trump would rather throw a tantrum than do his job. Democrats are ready to work to avoid a shutdown — Trump and Republicans are holding America hostage. Donald Trump will own the shutdown.”TangentThe Senate rejected on Friday both a GOP-sponsored bill to keep the government open past Oct. 1 and a separate proposal sponsored by Democrats. The House approved the Republican proposal, but it needs the support of at least seven Democrats to break the 60-vote filibuster threshold needed to pass the Senate. Key BackgroundCongress has repeatedly negotiated a new government funding deal in the final days before the shutdown deadline this year as deep partisan divisions, coupled with Republicans’ narrow majority in both chambers, has empowered Republicans to force through their demands with little input from Democrats. In a contrast from previous rounds of negotiations, Republicans aren’t proposing any new demands, but instead want to continue operating under the existing budget while they take time to negotiate a new plan. Trump warned Friday a shutdown was likely, blaming Democrats and telling reporters, “I think we could very well end up with a closed country for a period of time.”Further ReadingTrump cancels meeting with top Democrats on how to prevent a government shutdown (NBC News)Trump Cancels Meeting With Democrats as Shutdown Nears (New York Times)Trump cancels meeting with Democratic leaders ahead of government shutdown deadline (CNN)Got a tip?
