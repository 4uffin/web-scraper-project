(Photo by MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Images)AFP via Getty ImagesKey Facts“This will save money, and allow managers to focus on properly running their companies,” he wrote on Truth Social, adding “Did you ever hear the statement that, ‘China has a 50 to 100 year view on management of a company, whereas we run our companies on a quarterly basis???’ Not good!!!”Trump noted the change would be subject to approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has required companies to report quarterly earnings since 1970.Trump also made the suggestion during his first term and asked the SEC to study its feasibility, but the proposal never came to fruition. Trump’s suggestion comes ahead of an expected petition from the Long-Term Stock Exchange to the SEC to make the change, The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month, noting the group believes the move could save companies money and focus more on long-term goals.Critics of the idea, including the nonprofit Brookings Institution, argue shifting away from quarterly earnings could lead to less accurate stock prices and the potential for more insider trading, as executives and advisers would have access to nonpublic information for longer periods.Longer reporting periods could also deter investors by causing them to view the stocks as riskier without the more frequent updates on companies’ progress, according to The Accounting Review, the academic journal from the American Accounting Association.TangentJPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon and Warren Buffet advocated for a shift away from quarterly earnings guidance in a 2018 Journal op-ed, arguing it “often leads to an unhealthy focus on short-term profits at the expense of long-term strategy, growth and sustainability.”Big Number3,700. That’s the number of publicly traded companies in the U.S. as of late June, a 17% decrease from three years ago, the Journal reported earlier this month, citing the Center for Research in Security Prices. Some proponents of the idea have argued less burdensome reporting requirements would increase the number of public companies.Key BackgroundThe LTSE reportedly received encouraging feedback from the SEC in a meeting to discuss its proposal, which would be in line with its shift toward limiting regulation under Trump. The U.K. also did away with quarterly reporting about a decade ago and publicly listed European companies were allowed to stop quarterly reporting after a 2013 rule change.Further ReadingTrump Says Companies Should Report Earnings Every Six Months (Bloomberg)Trump endorses dramatic shift to the US economy (CNN)Trump advocates to end quarterly earnings reports (CNBC)Got a tip?
