President Donald Trump speaks to the media before boarding Marine One on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington D.C., on September 11, 2025.(Photo by MEHMET ESER/Middle East Images/AFP via Getty Images)Middle East Images/AFP via Getty ImagesKey FactsTrump said on Fox & Friends his administration will send the “National Guard and anybody else we need” to Memphis, calling it “deeply troubled.” Trump confirmed the deployment after telling reporters Thursday he was considering sending troops there or to St. Louis, alleging they have higher crime rates than Chicago.Memphis police reported earlier this month a six-year low in homicides and a 25-year low in overall crime, WREG Memphis reported.Trump said he would have rather sent National Guard troops to Chicago, where the city’s Democrat mayor and governor have rejected his suggestion.Trump can’t activate the National Guard outside Washington, D.C., without permission from the state’s governor absent exceptional circumstances, such as an insurrection or natural disaster.Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee, a Republican, has suggested he would cooperate with the federal deployment, saying earlier this week in a statement, “for months” he has “been in constant communication with the Trump Administration to develop a strategic plan to combat crime in Memphis.”This is a developing story and will be updated.Got a tip?
