Sara Dorn is a Forbes news reporter who covers politics.Follow AuthorSep 24, 2025, 02:11pm EDTSep 24, 2025, 02:55pm EDTShareSaveCommentAdd Us On GoogleToplineSenate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said he is “very concerned” about President Donald Trump’s warning that taking Tylenol while pregnant could cause autism—becoming the most powerful Republican in Washington to challenge a claim
widely rebuked by the medical community.Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) speaks to the media during a press conference at the U.S. Capitol on September 19, 2025 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images)Getty ImagesKey Facts“I think science ought to guide these discussions and our decision-making around our health,” Thune said, telling CNN he was “obviously very concerned” about Trump’s comments and how they might affect the health of pregnant women.“There are studies out there that they reference, but again I think there are an awful lot of people who come to a different conclusion about the use of Tylenol,” the Senate majority leader said when asked about Trump on Monday urging pregnant women not to take Tylenol, alleging that its main ingredient, acetaminophen, is linked to autism.Thune is the highest ranking Republican to publicly question Trump—Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., a medical doctor who has been one of the most outspoken Republican critics of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has also disputed Trump’s remarks linking autism and the use of Tylenol while pregnant. Cassidy urged HHS to “release the new data that it has to support this claim,” writing Monday on X “the preponderance of evidence shows that this is not the case.”ContraDr. Mehmet Oz, who leads the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, also contradicted Trump’s warning on Tuesday, telling TMZ pregnant women who contract fevers “ought to be talking to a doctor anyway,” adding “the doctor’s almost certainly going to prescribe you something. Tylenol might be one of the things they give.”Key BackgroundTrump said Monday the U.S. Food and Drug Administration would begin recommending to physicians pregnant women should avoid taking Tylenol except in special circumstances, despite research showing no definitive link between acetaminophen and autism. “Fight like hell not to take it,” Trump told pregnant women about autism during a press conference Monday, while also suggesting children shouldn’t take Tylenol. Kennedy also indicated the health department could instead recommend the folinic acid leucovorin as treatment for autism, what he described as an “exciting therapy that may benefit large numbers of children who suffer from autism.” The drug is typically used to lessen some cancer treatment side effects.TangentPrevious studies on a potential link between autism and acetaminophen have produced inconclusive results. The Trump administration on Monday cited an August 2025 analysis by researchers at Mt. Sinai, the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Heath, UCLA's Fielding School of Public Health and UMass Lowell of 46 separate studies that found an association between prenatal exposure to acetaminophen and neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, though the analysis did not establish any clear ties between the drug and the disorder, nor did the researchers recommend pregnant women shouldn’t take Tylenol. A 2024 study of 2.4 million children in Sweden born between 1995 and 2019 found no association between Tylenol usage in pregnant women and any increased risk of “autism, ADHD, or intellectual disability.”Chief CriticsSeveral major medical groups have refuted the Trump administration’s new recommendations. President of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Steven Fleischman said in a statement it is “not only highly concerning to clinicians but also irresponsible,” and “not backed by the full body of scientific evidence.” “At this time, the weight of scientific evidence that acetaminophen use during pregnancy causes an increased risk for autism or ADHD is simply inconclusive,” the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine President Sindhu K. Srinivas said in a statement. “Pregnant patients can be reassured that using acetaminophen to treat pain and fever is safe,” the SMFM wrote, noting that “untreated fever and pain during pregnancy carry significant maternal and infant health risks.” Tylenol owner Kenvue also rejected Trump’s claims in a statement via spokesperson Melissa Witt, who said “We believe independent, sound science clearly shows that taking acetaminophen does not cause autism. We strongly disagree with any suggestion otherwise and are deeply concerned with the health risk this poses for expecting mothers.” Further ReadingTrump Ties Tylenol During Pregnancy To Autism: ‘Don’t Take It’ (Forbes)RFK Jr. Promises To Identify Cause Of Autism By September — What To Know About His Claim (Forbes)CDC Plans Large Study On Long-Debunked Connection Between Vaccines And Autism, Report Says (Forbes)Got a tip?
