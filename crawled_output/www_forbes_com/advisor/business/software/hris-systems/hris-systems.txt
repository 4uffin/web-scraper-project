Expert Take
The best way for a business to transform HR from a cost center to a revenue enhancer is by applying management tools that make workers more productive. Rippling’s workflow automations can be used to reduce the time and effort required to complete nearly every administrative task your operation requires: from new employee onboarding to dispensing and tracking the equipment workers rely on in their jobs.
You can assign roles and permissions that allow managers and employees to create custom workflows that convert simple if… then… else… instructions into a virtual workforce able to complete such tasks as expense reporting, time-off scheduling and compliance notifications with no human intervention.
Rippling’s workflow automations can be triggered by specific responses to an employee survey that create actions such as scheduling a meeting or adding PTO.
The downside of Rippling’s automated workflows is that the company’s Core platform restricts their use to onboarding tasks, and its Pro product allows only 10 custom workflows, although you can purchase unlimited workflows as an add-on.

Users have mixed opinions about Rippling, with some appreciating its automation capabilities, customer support, and ease of integration and implementation, particularly for small to medium businesses. Positive feedback highlights its user-friendly interface and functionality for managing HR, IT and payroll in a streamlined manner. However, many users express dissatisfaction with the service due to concerns about cost, lack of customizability, customer support and misleading service features, while some find the interface less intuitive than expected, reflecting a generally lukewarm sentiment among the user base.
Pros & Cons
Custom workflows automate common HR and administrative tasks
Roles and permissions allow managers to control access to workflow tools
Extensive automation recipe library provides plug-and-play workflows
Core plan limits custom workflows to onboarding tasks
Removing the Pro package’s cap of 10 custom workflows requires purchasing an add-on
Modular approach to purchasing HRIS components can drive up the price

Expert Take
Nothing can sink your company’s morale faster than when employees and HR administrators learn you’re about to switch to a new HR system. BambooHR takes the sting out of the process of migrating to and learning a new HR platform, especially for businesses making the transition from small to midsize.
That’s where the simple, open BambooHR interface can make a big difference in how smoothly your work teams function. For example, HR and business managers will need access to more reporting capabilities for workforce planning and employee management. BambooHR’s clear reporting features make generating and interpreting reports fast and straightforward. For example, standard reports for workforce planning, PTO use and employee turnover can be created with just a few clicks and are saved automatically to your Home dashboard for easy access.
Planning for a growing company’s future workforce needs is made easier by BambooHR’s informative and readable analytics features.
BambooHR’s integrated approach to HR, payroll and benefits administration in its Core, Pro and Elite plans applies the company’s clear and intuitive interface across all functions. The payroll, benefits and time-tracking components are sold separately, but you get a 15% discount when purchasing payroll and benefits administration together.

BambooHR receives mixed reviews from users, with its strong points being its user-friendly interface and effectiveness in handling onboarding and employee records, especially for small to medium-sized companies. Many users appreciate its customer service and ease of use, making it a popular choice for organizations with less than 1000 employees. However, it faces criticism for its limited scalability, lack of advanced payroll and reporting features, and pricing concerns, which may pose challenges for larger companies or those with more complex HR needs. Overall, BambooHR is well-regarded for its simplicity and solid customer support, but it may not be suitable for organizations with advanced requirements or rapid growth plans.
Pros & Cons
Designed to be easy for small businesses to implement and for employees to use
Extends the simple, clear interface across HR, payroll and other functions
Supports companies as they grow and their HRIS needs expand
Compensation management and advanced reporting in high-end Elite plan only
Payroll, benefits administration and time tracking sold as add-ons

Expert Take
For most SMBs, it’s difficult to separate their HR operations from their payroll processing. However, HRIS vendors tend to focus on one of these two important administrative areas and make the other a kind of tag-along service. Despite its name, Paycor is clearly an HR software vendor first and a payroll processing service second. (Note that the company was recently acquired by Paychex.)
At the heart of Paycor’s services is its enterprise-like human capital management (HCM) platform that extends from recruiting new workers to retaining them by creating an engaging work environment and helping employees advance in their careers. The HCM approach integrates payroll and HR management, expense management and HR analytics for businesses with fewer than 50 workers as well as those with more than 1,000 employees.
Paycor’s HCM tightly integrates HR and payroll management, providing enterprise-like features to companies with as few as a couple dozen employees.
The downside of small businesses adopting an enterprise approach to HRIS and payroll processing is the time and effort required to implement the system’s many bells and whistles. For example, the main Paycor HR screen gives managers and employees dozens of options within a single window, so they’ll likely find themselves shuffling through a series of dropdown menus to navigate to the functions they’re looking for. Many small companies will be better served by a simpler HRIS that they can grow into as their needs change.

Paycor has generally received negative reception from users, with many expressing dissatisfaction primarily due to poor customer service and problematic implementation processes. The customer support is frequently criticized for being unresponsive and ineffective, with issues often arising during the transition to using Paycor’s systems. Despite this, some users have noted that Paycor offers user-friendly features and competitive pricing, especially for basic administrative tasks and smaller companies. Overall, the sentiment leans towards disappointment, and potential users are cautioned to be self-sufficient or seek alternatives.

Workday’s HRIS goes beyond managing and tracking your workforce to personalizing schedules and assignments to make best use of their skills and capabilities. This serves the dual purpose of enhancing the group’s output and improving the work lives of employees by allowing them to do what they do best.
Imagine, for example, that you’ve got an empty shift to fill. Workday’s smart scheduler lets managers select the shift on their work calendar and request that the system suggest workers to take the shift. The list of suggested workers for the unassigned shift ranks the available employees by how closely they match the role’s requirements. Managers are also given the option of posting the open shift to the group’s shift board so employees can volunteer to take the shift.
The smart scheduling in Workday’s labor optimization tool automatically ranks available employees for open shifts based on their suitability to the role.
This level of workforce optimization is most useful to midsize and larger firms, but companies of all sizes can benefit from this and other enterprise-grade HRIS features sold by Workday. The risk for a small business is that it will be paying for more HR functionality than it needs. However, it’s never too soon for an organization of any size to start thinking like a big business.

Overall, Workday is recognized as a powerful and robust HRIS system that is particularly well-suited for large organizations, offering extensive customization and integration capabilities. However, it is often criticized for its high cost, complexity and challenging implementation, making it seem excessive for smaller companies.

Expert Take
The trend among HRIS vendors is to move away from selling preconfigured packages and toward the cafeteria approach of SMBs purchasing only the HR, payroll and other features they need in custom bundles. This makes it more time-consuming to shop for an HRIS system, but on the plus side, businesses are less likely to be paying for HR features they don’t need.
Uzio takes much of the sting out of buying an HRIS by providing a fast quote calculator that  shows the price you’ll pay for the modules you require and your employee headcount. For example, a custom package combining Uzio’s Core plan ($30 a month plus $13 per employee per month) with Benefits Administration ($4.50 per employee a month) and Time Management ($4.50 per employee a month) would cost a 20-worker company $470 a month.
Uzio
Uzio’s fast quote calculator lets you shop for an HRIS with just the right features in only minutes.
I was impressed by how easy it is to use Uzio’s time-tracking feature. You can view reports on the total hours worked, overtime hours and remote work completed (geofencing) from within the schedule app itself. Managers can approve a worker’s hours from the schedule and view a breakdown of the time they spent working on specific projects during the pay period. Customizable job codes make it easy for employees to indicate the project they’ll be working on while clocking in.

Overall, users have mixed feedback about Uzio. Many appreciate its user-friendly interface, ease of use and comprehensive features that streamline HR processes and benefit management. However, some users have encountered issues with technical glitches, such as login problems and difficulties in navigation, as well as a lack of detailed reporting functions and limited integrations. While many note that customer service is responsive and helpful, they also mention miscommunication. Generally, Uzio effectively serves its primary functions for many, particularly for smaller businesses, but there are areas identified for improvement, particularly in user experience and advanced features.

Expert Take
One of the best ways for a small business to retain their most valuable employees is by offering them a benefits package that matches or tops those offered by large organizations. All three of Gusto’s HRIS packages come with administration of medical, dental and vision insurance, with Gusto serving as your broker. You pay only the plan premiums, or if you wish to retain your current benefits broker, the company charges $6 per eligible employee each month (included with the high-end Premium plan). The company also offers employee spending and savings accounts.
Benefits that Gusto sells as add-ons to its three HRIS plans include health savings accounts (HSA), flexible spending accounts (FSA), dependent care FSAs, life and disability insurance and workers compensation. Employee benefit deductions are applied to payroll runs automatically, and Gusto’s benefits advisors are available to help you decide on the best package for your workers.
Gusto’s benefits administration page shows an overview of the benefits your business offers.
I was pleasantly surprised by the financial benefits available from Gusto that offer employees auto-saving and budgeting tools that are built into the company’s mobile app. Employers can also offer their workers an interest-earning debit card and checking account, commuter benefits and 401(k) retirement savings. A useful feature of the Gusto Wallet app is its Spending account that tracks payments for transportation, housing, food and other expenses to help employees establish and maintain a budget.

Gusto is generally viewed as a cost-effective and user-friendly HR and payroll solution, particularly suited for small to medium-sized businesses and organizations with fewer than 100 employees. Many users praise its intuitive interface and ease of use for payroll and basic HR tasks, but some express dissatisfaction with customer support and limited scalability and functionality beyond payroll. Despite its positive aspects, including streamlined HR processes and affordability, concerns exist over support difficulties and challenges faced when managing more complex or growing business needs.

Zoho People proves that no business–and no business budget–is too small for an HRIS. A startup or other operation with five or fewer employees can get bare-bones time-off and document management along with a rudimentary employee database by using Zoho People’s free version. However, any employer of five or more workers will benefit by spending as little as $1.50 per employee a month ($1.25 per employee per month under annual billing) to get the company’s Essential plan that adds onboarding, scheduling and support for unlimited administrators.
It takes only a few minutes to create a free Zoho People account. After you provide your contact information and verify the account by clicking an email link, you’re asked whether you want to have sample data added to the account or start from scratch. The sample data can be deleted at any time. You then set up your organization by adding information about it and your workers. From the Zoho People home screen you have access to upcoming activities, feeds, profiles, approvals and scheduling information.
Access upcoming activities, feeds, approvals and employee scheduling information from the Zoho People home screen.
The Professional, Premium and Enterprise versions of Zoho People are better options for most SMBs because they add more time and attendance features. In addition, the Premium and Enterprise products come with employee and compensation management, which is especially useful to growing businesses. Add-ons for all paid plans cover learning management (included with Enterprise), custom reports and premium support.

Your Voice makes it easy to track and address reports from workers through its case management dashboard, including average resolution time and the impact of outcomes.
Engagement is about more than identifying and addressing problems, however. HiBob’s proactive approach invites employees to complete their personal profiles, post short video bios and find common ground with coworkers through common interests or shared locations for remote workforces. The system encourages managers and employees to celebrate their coworkers’ accomplishments on and off the job and establish mentor-mentee and peer relationships that can last through their careers and beyond.

Expert Take
For a growing number of SMBs, the best HRIS option is to let the pros handle it so they can focus more of their time and energy on running the business and less on administration. Two great options for outsourcing HRIS are TriNet’s HR Plus, which lets companies retain their status as the employer of record, and its professional employer organization (PEO) service that handles all HR-related matters and creates a co-employer relationship with your business.
HR Plus is an administrative services organization (ASO) that combines TriNet’s HR platform for HR, payroll and benefits with tax compliance, an HR Operations audit, performance management, learning management, COBRA, flexible spending accounts (FSA) and advice from tax specialists. You also get access to a dedicated payroll manager for added compliance assistance as well as help confirming the accuracy of your payroll and deductions.
TriNet PEO works with your company to craft a custom HRIS solution that covers payroll, benefits administration and all aspects of employee management, including recruiting, onboarding and time and attendance. The service also offers risk mitigation analyses, workers compensation management and 401(k) retirement plans. However, PEOs require that you give up some control over your workforce, and while you retain full management of the business itself, you share some liability with the PEO for the management of your employees.

Overall, TriNet receives a mixed assessment from users. While some users appreciate the user-friendly design and find the app convenient for clocking in and managing HR tasks, many express frustration with frequent crashes, login issues and insufficient customer support. The app’s functionality is often criticized for lacking crucial features, which results in an unproductive experience for users. Despite some positive comments on ease of use and customer service for small businesses, negative experiences with technical issues and service responsiveness contribute to a generally unfavorable sentiment among TriNet customers.
Pros & Cons
ASO service lets you outsource HR and payroll while retaining management control
PEO frees your managers to focus on business operations rather than administration
Employees receive enterprise-class benefits options
Outsourcing HRIS to an ASO or PEO requires ceding some management control
Businesses may still be liable for HR and payroll compliance requirements
In-house HRIS management likely more cost-effective for very small businesses
Methodology
Our testing of HRIS systems began by evaluating 55 HRIS products from 25 different vendors. Our evaluation measured 30 distinct factors impacting HRIS users and applied weighted scores for each category. The product scores that resulted from this initial testing were used to identify the top 10 HRIS systems. I then put these 10 products through more thorough testing to pinpoint each one’s strengths and weaknesses, including the feature that makes each product stand out from the crowd. We’re confident that one of our Best HRIS Systems will be a good fit for your organization.

Hands-On Testing
How To Choose the Best HRIS System
Purchasing an HRIS begins by determining the features your organization needs at present and in the future, as well as the amount you’re able to spend, which is usually based on a flat monthly fee plus a per-employee charge.
Essential HRIS System Features
The four cornerstones of an HRIS are recruitment and onboarding, employee management, payroll and benefits management, and compliance and reporting.
Recruitment and Onboarding
While recruiting is often excluded from the entry-level products of HRIS vendors, onboarding is an essential component of nearly every HRIS we reviewed. Rippling, our top pick, is noteworthy for its ability to automate the onboarding process using custom workflows and ready-made recipes.
Employee Management
The components of an employee management system are a database for secure, centralized storage of employee information, time and attendance tracking that includes a scheduling component for salaried and hourly workers, an employee self-service portal that provides easy, secure access to pay and benefit records, employee performance evaluations and reporting that provides insights into the effectiveness of your workforce management efforts. The employee management features of BambooHR’s HRIS solution provide multiple views of compensation and other data, custom access levels for its employee portal and a customizable employee database.
Payroll and Benefits Management
While very small businesses may not need an HRIS that prepares and processes their payroll and manages employee benefits, nearly every other SMB will find these two functions indispensable in their HRIS solution. Paycor stands out among the vendors in our rankings for its tight integration of payroll with other HR functions in its Core and Complete plans. In addition to handling all state and local compliance matters, the products come with custom HR reports and pre-built analytics dashboards.
For companies looking for comprehensive benefits packages at affordable prices, Gusto’s three plans include administration of health benefits and employee spending and savings accounts, while the high-end Premium offering adds health insurance broker integration. Uzio’s cafeteria-style pricing lets businesses add benefits that support the insurance carriers of your choice and charge only for employees who actually sign up for benefits. The benefits option costs only $4.50 a month per employee.
Compliance and Reporting
By maintaining compliance with HR regulations, a company mitigates its legal liabilities and other risks, including fines for non-compliance and charges of discrimination, harassment and retaliation.
Uzio’s HRIS products give businesses a choice of compliance add-ons ranging from multiliingual employee handbooks and OSHA logs to customizable courses for employees, to name just a few.
Value
Small businesses can expect to pay less than $100 a month plus about $8 per user a month for a plan that offers standard HRIS functions. Adding payroll and benefits administration increases the monthly price by $50 to $100 plus another $5 to $8 per employee. Similarly, time tracking and attendance features will up the total cost by about $3.50 per employee a month.
Zoho People is our choice as the most affordable HRIS.

Which HRIS System Is Best for Your Business?
Businesses with 10 or fewer workers looking for a basic HRIS solution can save money while preparing for future growth by going with a vendor such as Uzio or Zoho People that lets them start with a low-cost plan and add services as their needs change. More established companies are best served by an HRIS that combines HR management with payroll and benefits administration such as Paycor or Gusto.
SMBs that want to maximize the value of their HRIS investment will enhance the efficiency of HR, payroll and other administrative tasks by purchasing a system that makes it easy to automate manual operations. Products from Rippling and Personio feature customizable and preconfigured workflow automations that improve the accuracy of HR and payroll by reducing manual data entry while streamlining repetitive processes such as onboarding and management of open enrollment for benefits.
Lastly, it’s never too soon for a company of any size to start thinking and operating like an enterprise. Workday’s Go human capital management (HCM) solution for growing businesses comes in preconfigured packages designed for fast implementation at a relatively low cost. The system combines HR and payroll with finance management for organizations with 500 or fewer employees. Another option for small companies that want to think big is to outsource their HR, payroll and benefits administration to an ASO or PEO such as TriNet’s HR Plus and PEO service.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
What’s the difference between an HRIS System and an HRMS and HCM?
A human resource information system (HRIS) links the management of all HR-related data, including payroll, benefits, employee management and recruitment. By contrast, a human resource management system (HRMS) is a suite of individual HR software components that lacks the integration of an HRIS. The term has fallen out of favor with the arrival in recent years of fully integrated HRIS solutions. Human capital management (HCM) describes cloud-based systems designed to support workforce planning and modeling, as well as to enhance the work experience through use of AI assistants and other technologies.
What are the benefits of an HRIS System?
An HRIS system allows a company’s HR staff to focus more on interacting with managers, employees and job candidates and less on administrative tasks. The HRIS benefits managers by automating many tasks related to training and supervising workers, and it helps employees be more productive by enhancing their engagement with their work and providing easy, secure access to the pay, benefits and other employment data.
How do I implement an HRIS?
Like any other project, HRIS implementation begins by planning the implementation’s scope, cost and other particulars. After selecting several potential HRIS solutions and requesting demos and price proposals, you create a pilot project, train workers and begin the deployment.
