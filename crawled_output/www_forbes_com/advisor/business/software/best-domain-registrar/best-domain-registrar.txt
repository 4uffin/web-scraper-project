Free domain names with hosting offers are expensive. Most people register a new domain name as part of getting web hosting, but renewal rates are often a case of sticker shock and security is often lacking. Most of the best domain registrars specialize in domain registration first and hosting second (if at all), allowing them to offer better prices, security and more features.
My picks for the best domain registrar list are the result of years of industry experience, a deep dive into the features and specifications, research into the experiences of thousands of real-life customers just like you and hands-on testing of each ranking provider. After all of the tests we put each provider through, little piggy Porkbun wiggled its way to the top with affordable pricing, outstanding security, great ease of use and a friendly support team.

Expert Take
Unless you are a tech pro, you probably haven’t heard of Porkbun, but just like those fabulous freshly steamed pork buns you love, Porkbun the domain registrar is filled with deliciousness. Solid first year at-cost pricing with low-margin renewal rates is the cornerstone for Porkbun, and your domain management dashboard gives you renewal estimates so you are never caught off guard if prices start to rise.
The easy-to-navigate domain management dashboard is a welcome sight for anyone, but especially beginners who are still struggling to get the hang of the technical side of domain name management. Quick links to helpful beginner-friendly tutorials, walk-throughs and videos for each control make Porkbun much less intimidating for beginners than many domain management systems. I also appreciate how easy SSL management is with Porkbun.
Porkbun’s dashboard is laid out well and offers detailed help links for beginners.
Extra services, including email and hosting, are convenient, and I love the security features of its email partner, ProtonMail. I also like that this little piggy has a market—access to the third-party domain aftermarket, that is—and domain auctions are also available. Strong security features and easily reachable customer support round out Porkbun’s offerings nicely for an all-around champ.

Porkbun rapidly rose to prominence with its beginner-friendly dashboard, low-cost pricing and renewal transparency. Customers regularly praise the ease of use and lack of hidden fees and customer service. However, there are scattered reports of horrible customer service experiences, most of which seem to be quickly addressed by Porkbun on review aggregator sites. Overall, Porkbun has one of the most positive reputations among domain registrars.

Testing Insights
I absolutely love it when a company doesn’t take itself too seriously, and Porkbun leans into the piggy tales with lots of fun icons for different TLDs and a generally friendly demeanor. Far from just being the class clown, Porkbun is a solid performer that makes customers feel welcome. I also love that it doesn’t make you jump through hoops to get a transfer authorization number if needed. It’s just a few clicks away on the dashboard.
Porkbun plays well with every host I’ve tested, and the controls and dashboard always work like they should. The only thing that is likely to trip up new users is that if you manually adjust name records to your host (instead of using the autoconnect features from your host), you need to delete the two default CNAME and A records first.

Expert Take
Spaceship has a personality all its own. While fun, it isn’t as intuitive as Porkbun and often feels more flash than function. That said, the functions are all there and pretty easy to set up, just don’t forget “launchpad” is the dashboard link.
Like many registrars, a CDN costs extra, but it’s not a dealbreaker by any means. Also, if you use Spaceship, you’ll need a host that provides SSLs as they aren’t available on the domain side. Most hosts provide these, but it is an important point to remember.
I love the propagation map, which gives you instant information about the progress of any record changes. Propagation was also surprisingly fast, and changing records is simple and straightforward.
Spaceship includes a simple propagation map to help visualize progress.
Overall, Spaceship is a solid domain registrar, but there’s still room for them to grow and work out some gremlins, like the spotty AI assistant and less-than-stellar documentation files. Then again, it was only launched in 2023, and it has been making steady improvements with new features regularly, so I’m excited to see how this Namecheap company will continue to grow.

Reactions are fairly well mixed for Spaceship. While many love the low pricing and interface, others note mystery account suspensions and domain verification problems. The user interface also has mixed results, but generally lands more on the positive side. Even customer service support has positive reports despite some vocal complaints. At the moment, Spaceship seems to fall squarely into a love it or hate it category.

Spaceship takes a minute to get ready to blast off. The initial interface, while flashy, isn’t the most intuitive at first glance, thanks to an overabundance of “fun” labels instead of functional ones. However, once you find the right thing to click, managing your domain is easy. Mostly, there’s too much extra stuff on the interface, wanting you to add on services.
Once you get to the domain itself, click the domain name, not the connections button. From there, a sidebar menu pops up that is much easier to navigate than the connections screen for basic tasks. Hopping down to the advanced tools opens the full management dashboard you might expect to see in one place with other providers. It’s absolutely suitable for all experience levels, you just have to puzzle through the menu for a few minutes at first.

Expert Take
Cloudflare can easily overwhelm a beginner, but the list of tools and security features is hard to beat. Its CDN alone is a great feature that you don’t have to manually configure when using Cloudflare domains.
Cloudflare is both a domain registrar and a name server (DNS) provider with additional plans that can be added to your domain registration for advanced features such as extra caching, PCI and SOC 2 Type II compliance, an API gateway and more support options. The base plan is free, but the paid plans give you room to grow as your company website needs grow.
Basic controls are simple, with SSL and many other security measures handled automatically. That said, there are so many controls and features, even with the free plan, that you can get lost easily. Take your time and slowly learn the dashboard for the best results if you are a beginner.
In spite of the detailed control options, the basic domain management features with Cloudflare are easily accessed.
It’s also worth noting that community support and documentation are the only help if you use the free plan to underpin your domain registration. If you are a beginner, you may run into trouble without live support occasionally until you get the hang of things.

Cloudflare’s at-cost domain pricing is often called out as a positive and users love the stable pricing. However, a lack of customer support for free plans leads to a lot of frustration when things go wrong. Even for paid plans, there is a bit of grumbling over slow support for lower-level plans. Nearly universally, customers dislike not being able to change the nameservers, and Google Sites users complain about A record problems. However, the strong security features and affordability keep most users coming back and willing to put up with any shortcomings in support and user interfaces.

Cloudflare sells domain registrations at cost, so it’s one of the cheapest possible long-term solutions. In general, the domain registrations are there as a bonus to the other Cloudflare products. For most applications, it’s a great option, but Cloudflare doesn’t hold your hand if you need help.
There are no quick help popups and cute video tutorials to walk you through the process. Considering its low cost and free feature plan, I also want to point out that it doesn’t work well with Google Sites, particularly in setting the A records so it appears without the www. prefix. Google Sites doesn’t provide an IP for manually setting that record, and Cloudflare doesn’t work around that.

It’s not pretty, but it works. NameSilo doesn’t win any points for interface design, but it is mostly straightforward for most security features and basic controls. It also has a great DNS template feature where you can preset name records to apply to multiple domains. Preset configurations for a few dozen hosts are also available. That preset capability is a great option for anyone dealing with large numbers of domains.
NameSilo also offers hosting, email and other extra services. Unfortunately, SSLs are one of the extra costs, but they aren’t overpriced. NameSilo also offers a reseller program that couples well with the low domain costs, bulk discounts and a large number of supported TLDs.
In spite of a dated interface, NameSilo controls generally work well, except for problematic DNSSEC controls.
There are a few pieces missing, though. Beyond the extra cost for SSLs, setting security features is hit or miss at times. NameSilo seems to go out of its way to discourage DNSSEC use and while its support has a great reputation, the site seems designed to keep you from trying to contact them.

Following the trend, NameSilo faces mixed sentiment as well. While pricing, free WHOIS privacy and mostly user-friendly controls are praised, customer support reports are spotty. Reports of domain suspensions and poor handling of domain abuse reports are relatively common. Users also note affordability in spite of extra costs for items like SSLs. Overall, the customer service issues seem to be the driving force behind dissatisfaction

Windows XP, anyone? That was my first thought when I logged into NameSilo. The interface design is a blast from the past. In spite of that, controls all work well, and features are fairly easy to manage.
The biggest annoyance is the DNSSEC controls. NameSilo actively discourages you from using it and doesn’t provide support if you misconfigure something. While NameSilo’s low prices and extra security features, like a notification of any registration changes, are great, the lack of easy DNSSEC controls makes them more suitable for experienced domain managers than average business owners.

Expert Take
Like Cloudflare, DNSimple is primarily a DNS management provider that also offers domain registration. When you go up against a giant like Cloudflare, that often means everyone looks at you in comparison to the giant. It’s a bit like comparing Trader Joe’s and Whole Foods; both have great offerings, but the two companies take pretty different approaches.
DNSimple leans more into domain management itself rather than the extras surrounding it. So while SSLs are an extra cost and there aren’t as many third-party integrations, the plans offer more domain management tools at a lower plan level than Cloudflare. Security is still strong overall as well.
Unlike Cloudflare, DNSimple’s free plan isn’t fully free. There’s a 50-cent charge per active domain zone each month and a 10-cent per million queries charge. The $29 monthly plan gives you access to single sign-on, something Cloudflare doesn’t offer until its custom-quoted enterprise-level plans. Choosing between the two is just a matter of matching your needs to the plan features.
DNSimple puts some fun into your day by making music from your domain name records.
Managing your domain is simple, with one of the clearest menu setups I’ve seen, bordering on chef’s-kiss perfection. One-click record templates include a nice selection of providers, there’s an option for vanity name servers, DNSSEC is quick to set up, more record types are supported (such as ALIAS, POOL and URL) and it supports Anycast. Plus, there’s a completely useless but hilarious option to make music with your domain name records.

A user-friendly interface and comprehensive domain name server features top the DNSimple praise list. Users love how straightforward and efficient domain management is on the platform. Even though customer support is only by email, most users are also happy with customer support responses and prompt reply speeds. Other than a few complaints about pricing, the outlook on DNSimple is overall positive. Robust API, flexibility and reliability are other items users comment positively on.

I always love seeing renewal pricing listed with domain information and that’s just the start of what I love about DNSimple. The menus and controls are logically arranged, easy to navigate and absolutely live up to the company name. The biggest issue I foresee new users facing is confusion over the pricing structure, similar to how Cloudflare’s plans on top of domain registration costs often perplex new users.
Sure, the DNSimple free plan that isn’t really free is annoying, but an extra $6 or so per year won’t break the bank. Once you get that concept down, managing your domain is almost enjoyable with DNSimple, something that’s very rare among domain registrars today.
DNSimple also got a real laugh out loud from me with the “make music from your domain records” feature. It’s useless, except for brightening your day, but absolutely one of my new favorite things.

The .com TLD may be the most popular, but it isn’t the right fit for everyone. With over 2,000 supported domain extensions, INWX offers an amazing array of choices to find just the right fit for your company or personal project.
INWX’s controls are straightforward and bulk actions are a great addition. However, it’s the TLD choices that really shine for INWX and garnered a spot on my best domain registrar list. Pricing appears low on many domains at first glance, but INWX doesn’t include many features that other registrars do without an extra cost.
Having to pay extra for WHOIS privacy is a huge pet peeve of mine, and my hill to die on is that companies charging for WHOIS do so to artificially lower the domain registration costs in searches to make themselves look more competitive than they actually are. As such, bear in mind you’ll need to pay an extra $5 or so for privacy on top of your domain registration costs. It’s not the cheapest domain registrar. SSLs are also another add-on, so if your host doesn’t provide SSLs, you need to consider that in pricing as well.
The extra charge for domain privacy from INWX often negates much of the registration savings.
While all that does negate some of INWX’s great deals on lesser-known domain extensions, it’s still not a dealbreaker (other than the annoyance factor) much of the time, especially if you are hunting an extension that’s not widely available.

Reliable domain registration with a clear helpful communication from customer support is the cornerstone of INWX sentiment. Customers overall love the large number of supported TLD offerings as well. However, some customers complain about pricing practices and additional costs. There are also concerns over communication and problem resolution during high-stress events such as service outages. Overall, the result is a mixed sentiment about INWX.

INWX is a love-hate situation for me. I love a lot of the features and despise the pricing model of add-ons everywhere. Charging extra for items most consider standard will always feel like an underhanded marketing ploy to me.
However, I’ve never found a feature that didn’t work as intended with INWX, and there are some helpful items I really like. The domain log lets me see all domain actions at a glance, there’s a record search and replace feature I want to see everywhere (seriously, any registrars who don’t have this and are reading this list, snap to it) and bulk actions are a nice time saver.

Simple, economical and effective sums up Namecheap. The dashboard is no-frills but features work easily, like a simple toggle to activate DNSSEC and easy domain ownership transfers if needed, without spending hours hunting for the right menu.
Like most registrars, there are some extra options you can purchase, like hosting and email, but the core features for domains are all there, plus extras like Dynamic DNS controls to automatically keep track of changing IP addresses. DNS templates are also available, but there are only three presets. Likewise, SSLs are a bit of a letdown, with them only being available through Namecheap’s hosting (or whatever other host you choose) instead of as part of the domain registration.
Namecheap’s domain controls are straightforward, including easy DNSSEC activation.
While not always the cheapest domain name registrar, Namecheap is usually pretty close, with Cloudflare’s at-cost model just edging them out for renewals, and Namecheap-owned Spaceship generally winning first-year discount offers by a nose. Overall, it’s a solid, uncomplicated domain registrar with good tool tips for beginners. It also offers auctions, bulk discounts and tools suitable for high-volume domain registration and is moving from standard 2FA to an authentication app for tighter account security.

Long praised for low domain registration costs, customers mostly like the initial first year pricing and are not as happy with renewal rates. Customers do appreciate the reliable nature of services and the easy-to-use dashboard for domain management. Free WHOis privacy is also well-received. Customers aren’t as enthusiastic about customer support, however. Customer support reports are mixed, with happy outcomes and others bordering on dumpster fires. Some also note poor usability of the mobile app as a cause for concern. Mostly positive overall, renewal price jumps and the unpredictable customer service outcomes are continuing concerns.

Namecheap doesn’t really shine, but it isn’t a bad option. It’s what you should expect from a budget domain name registrar, and it doesn’t try to hide the basicness behind flashy icons. The dashboard is straightforward and functional, but the contrast is not accessibility friendly, with many features in a light blue that could be a big issue for those with vision impairments.
I didn’t find any features that didn’t work, and although some features weren’t well-organized, the tool tips linked to common problem areas are a great help for beginners or experienced domain managers new to the Namecheap interface.

Primarily a webhost, DreamHost still offers strong domain registration features. Pricing tends to fall in the middle with DreamHost. First-year discounts aren’t as steep, but renewal pricing tends to be more stable than with many other registrars.
Domain registration is primarily a way to get you in the door to try to sell other services, and your first dashboard screen will be mostly a wall of ads for extra services. However, most of the ads are confined to that landing page, so it isn’t as obtrusive once you get into the control menus. Menus are fractured, with different features split up under separate menu categories, and most of the management is through the website menu instead of the domain menu.
Domains at DreamHost often seem like a marketing tool to sell other services.
My biggest gripe with DreamHost is the convenient glossing over of the fact that its name servers are not DNSSEC compatible. So, even though DNSSEC is included with your domain, you can only use it if you change your name servers to third-party DNSSEC-compatible name servers.

DreamHost has a lot of fans of its customer service, with users noting it is friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. However, others note dissatisfaction that DreamHost nameservers aren’t DNSSEC compatible and many note billing concerns. Many who use hosting in conjunction with domain registration complain about technical issues, but others praise overall solid performance.

While it isn’t an uncommon practice for domain registrars who offer hosting, I absolutely despise the practice of putting most domain management features under the website menu. That said, once you remember you are on a host-first registrar dashboard (and get past the walls of ads for extra services), controls are fairly straightforward, although scattered. The AI Assistant will be your best friend in finding what menus each control is hidden under.
The only feature that stood out positively for me was that when adding or changing domain name records, the screen includes name record descriptions and groups the most common ones at the top of the list for quick access.

Dynadot doesn’t set up nameservers by default, but it makes adding your own nameservers easy (if you are self-hosting). However, for SMBs, it’s the free one-page website builder and its nameservers that add the real value to Dynadot. Your domain registration includes a one-page website and one email address, making it a great low-cost option to get your company online for the first time.
Dynadot offers a free one-page website and one email address with domain registration.
Domain management itself is fairly simple, but for beginners, it works best with Dynadot’s other offerings. It still has some nice features for more advanced users, though. There’s a domain watchlist option to track when domains you want are available for purchase, and the domain sales dashboard can handle listings for domains registered elsewhere as well.

Account management and domain registration verification are generally seen as cumbersome using Dynadot. While customers like the customer service speed and results overall, concerns about scam report handling do affect overall scores. Customers seem to get the most out of combining products rather than only using domain registration features, which are seen as somewhat limited, leading to a mixed sentiment overall.

Dynadot is underwhelming as a stand-alone domain registrar for me, thanks to the lack of default stand-alone name servers, DNSSEC setup complications and the perpetually broken AI chatbot. However, I like that it offers a simple way for a business to get online for the first time with basic email.
While I wouldn’t suggest that for a complicated website, the builder is quite capable of helping you create a one-page website quickly. However, most of the templates (if you don’t use the AI builder) automatically generate a multipage site, and then the system nags you to upgrade your plan as you work to delete the unincluded parts of the site before publishing.

Expert Take
First-year pricing is one of the main draws with IONOS. It regularly offers first-year registration on many domain names for $1 or under, including .com extensions, which are often excluded from loss leader sales by other registrars. It also offers domain extension bundles, allowing you to obtain multiple TLDs (usually .com, .org, .info and .cloud) for your domain name, all for $1 in many cases.
But renewal rates aren’t the best, so you may want to consider transferring to a different domain registrar during that first year if IONOS’s other features don’t tick all the boxes on your wishlist.
IONOS does have some nice domain features, though, including wildcard SSLs, email, 1-click connections with Domain Connect and 24/7 phone support. For me, phone support is important enough to justify slightly higher renewal prices. Downtime costs can be astronomical, and fast support is vital, especially if you have an e-commerce website.
The generic landing page for a new domain registered with IONOS is an advertisement for IONOS.
Plus, while you must use a participating website host for it to work, I love that IONOS participates in Domain Connect. This program eliminates much of the manual work involved in connecting your domain and hosting, making it a great option for those new to domain management. There are over 110 participating providers, so if you aren’t comfortable with nameserver and DNS record settings, I recommend checking to see if your web hosting provider (or control panel) is a participant before signing up.

Billing practices are a continuing concern with IONOS. While most billing issues surround hosting plans, smaller issues, such as delays in turning off auto-renewal on domains, are also of concern with domain registration. However, some customers do praise the 24/7 technical support, even though many state there were issues with getting errors resolved. Further, customers are not fond of the mobile app functionality.

While I like the extension sets for IONOS and most of the controls, what sticks in my craw is the automatically generated landing page for your domain being an ad for IONOS. I’d rather have a generic number error holding page thrown up until I can point the domain to my website or landing page.
I did like the quick access option that gives you a fast list of quick connections and domain management tools. However, the constant ads for buying extra domains or services get old very fast. Likewise, if you use IONOS and don’t want domain autorenewal, you’ll need to set yourself a reminder to log back in within a few days, as the ability to turn off autorenewal is locked for the first 24 to 48 hours after purchase.

Four Levels of Fact-Checking
Hands-On Testing
How To Choose the Best Domain Registrar
Picking the best domain registrar means finding the best security and top-notch customer service at an affordable price. Domain management tools and dashboards are equally important, but registrars often take different approaches to these. Some domain management dashboards are more user-friendly, and others require more technical skill. Finding the one that fits your technical skill level usually means a better overall experience.
Essential Domain Registrar Features
Compared to figuring out the best website host, finding the best domain registrar is relatively simple. More features are yes/no choices instead of ranges of services and the features list is shorter. The most important things to look for in a domain registrar include security, ICANN certification, domain management tools, uptime and customer support.
Ease of use. Managing domain name servers is a bit technical and can be very confusing. Simplified interfaces, dashboards and tooltips make the process easier.
ICANN certification. ICANN accreditation lets you know that your domain registrar has agreed and is accountable for a specific set of rules. While not guaranteeing a good experience, reviewing the ICANN list of accredited registrars helps customers know which registrars are legitimate entities.
DNSSEC. Today’s global internet community brings with it more risks, and you can’t leave your virtual doors unlocked anymore. DNSSEC is a set of cryptographic signatures added to your DNS records to help verify and authenticate information, as part of preventing cyberattacks such as DNS spoofing, where hackers counterfeit query responses.
Registry locks. Registry locks (sometimes called domain locks) stop unauthorized (or accidental) changes to your registration information by adding extra verification steps, similar to 2FA protection for your account. So, while DNSSEC ensures transmitted information validity, registry locks stop changes to your account information.
As Mark Flegg, senior director of technology for enterprise-class domain management company CSC, recently noted, “Even with strong credentials, two-factor authentication and hardened registrar security, the risk of DNS hijacking or administrative error remains. A registry lock helps mitigate that by preventing unauthorized changes to your domain.”
SSL. Yes, many hosting plans include an SSL certificate, but using a domain registrar that includes SSLs keeps you from risking losing security if you migrate (move) your website to a new hosting provider.
TLD support. Not every domain registrar offers every top-level domain (TLD). The extension, or TLD, is the part after the dot at the end of your domain name, such as .com, .net, .org or .shop. You’ll need to match your preferred extensions to domain registrar offerings. It is also important to remember that not all TLDs are publicly available. For example, .gov is only available to U.S.-based official government entities.
Reasonable pricing. While first-time registration discounts are great, renewal costs are the biggest concern. Watch out for registrars with abnormally high renewal rates that will be recurring costs.
Domain management tools. While some require more technical skills than others, every domain registrar must provide a way for you to adjust DNS settings and manage privacy, renewals, transfers and security.
Domain redemption. Occasionally, people forget to renew domain registrations and miss the grace period (usually at least 30 days). When that happens, some registrars offer a last chance to recover your domain name during the redemption period, although it usually costs considerably more.
Uptime. Just like your web host needs strong uptime rates, your domain registrar has to be online for your domain name to work. Look for uptime of 99.9% (three nines) as the bare minimum uptime with a preference to 99.99% (four nines) or better. That extra .09% uptime shaves nearly 8 hours off of annual downtime.
Customer support. Domain registration is relatively straightforward, but setting and managing your name servers, untangling what A records and MX records are and fixing glitches is almost always challenging when you first start out. Throw in dealing with security and cybersecurity, and top-notch customer support is vital.
Porkbun, Cloudflare, Spaceship and Namecheap each hit most of the high points, although the exact mix you need will determine which fits best for you.
Domain Pricing and Overall Value
There are only a few ways to get a free domain name, most of which are temporary. Domain name registrations are calculated yearly, and renewal costs are generally higher than initial purchase costs.
Average domain name costs are usually quite reasonable at around $10 to $50 annually. However, premium TLDs and high-demand names can sell for much more, with the most expensive domain name sold being cars.com at $872 million. Almost all of the domains I registered to test the best domain registrar finalists cost between $1 and $14, with the higher costs mostly being due to add-on WHOIS privacy fees or SSLs from a few providers.

Other than stable domain name renewal fees, differences in value from domain name registrars generally come from included features such as how many years you can register your domain name upfront, extra security tools, an easy-to-use domain management dashboard, CDNs, SSLs and great technical support.
For combined value, Cloudflare, Porkbun and Namecheap are considered frontrunners. However, each has a different mix of features and pricing.
Domain Management Tools Ease of Use
There’s an old line about you can’t tell the players without the program, meaning you need a guide to tell you what is what and who is who. Domain management is a lot like that. While the basics make sense once you’ve gotten the hang of it, when you are starting out, you need an easy-to-use set of domain management tools with plenty of helpful tips.
Changing names, addresses, DNS record pointing, handling renewal settings and managing security settings should never be complicated. The processes are straightforward and a domain registrar’s domain management dashboard should be as well. For example, I’ve seen cases where a registrar’s dashboard link to traffic logs redirected to a help file showing how to get to those tools. Unfortunately, when clicking on the help file link, it went right back to the original icon, putting users into an infinite loop of redirects with no way to actually access the traffic logs.
Porkbun knocks ease of use out of the park, with Namecheap and DNSimple close behind in spite of DNSimple’s more technical nature, thanks to well-organized menus and tools.
Security
Domain names are even more vital than your web hosting because they aren’t easily replaced. Losing your domain name would be like a rival company taking over both your brick-and-mortar location and company name. Your domain name is how customers find you online and your identity to consumers.
The internet isn’t the same small community it was in the early 1980s when DNS protocols were developed. Having strong security tools to prevent domain spoofing and other hacks isn’t optional; it’s vital. For example, popular domain registrars Bluehost and Hostinger didn’t make my best list because neither offers DNSSEC, an additional encryption protocol that helps stop bad actors from hijacking your domain and redirecting it to other websites.
Pro Tip
Remember that your name servers influence whether your domain registrar’s DNSSEC works. Some, like Porkbun, only offer DNSSEC on their own servers, while others, like DreamHost, only offer DNSSEC for third-party DNSSEC-compatible servers (but not their own). Be sure to check which servers DNSSEC applies to before signing up.
Common security measures to look for include SSL or TLS certificates, domain locks, privacy controls and two-factor authentication (2FA).
Cloudflare, DNSimple and Porkbun stand out for security features.
Technical support
Having strong technical support from your registrar to help if you are hacked or if you are confused about how to manage DNS settings is important. While some web hosts make pointing domain names automated, when you need to change DNS settings manually, it can be daunting.
The most common confusion expressed by SMBs I work with is not understanding which record does what. For example, figuring out A records and MX records and how to forward or redirect a domain so it resolves with and without the www. prefix. A domain host with good tutorials and great technical support makes the process much easier. Domain registration giant GoDaddy didn’t make our best domain registrars list partly because of severely lacking technical support (along with pricing and feature concerns).
Porkbun stands out for support with DNSimple and Cloudflare (for paid plans) also doing fairly well.
Specialty Domain Registrar Features
Beyond the core necessities, there are some great domain registrar features to watch for depending on your needs.
Bulk domain purchasing. Makes it easy to register groups of domains at one time. This is very useful for hosting resellers, domain name speculation or to buy your domain name on multiple TLDs at the same time.
Domain aftermarket. Some domain registrars offer tools to buy and sell pre-existing domain names. Domain auctions are also sometimes offered as part of this secondary domain market. If you are considering domain investing or want to buy a name that’s already registered, you’ll need this option.
Email accounts. Some domain registrars offer built-in email accounts. While not necessary, it’s a nice perk and keeps you from needing to buy email from your web hosting provider. However, if your domain registrar doesn’t include email, the best email hosting services often offer low-cost options.
Which Domain Registrar Is Best for Your Business?
Finding the best domain name registrar for your business often depends on your level of technical skill. Next you’ll need to look at features. If you just need basic registration and controls there are many options, but if you need advanced security or extra features such as domain auctions, your choices are more limited. Finally, budget comes into play as domain registrars have wildly different pricing for the same name in many cases.
If you are on a shoestring budget, Dynadot with its combination of domain registration, email and website, might be a good choice for you. Alternatively, if money is tight but you already have a web host in mind, Porkbun, Spaceship or Cloudflare’s low registration costs might be the best domain registration option for you.
If you’ve never dealt with domains before, Porkbun and Namecheap’s beginner-friendly interfaces are good options.
If your business needs advanced API or extra security features, Cloudflare and DNSimple offer more choices.
If you are working with bulk purchases or stepping into domain flipping, you’ll want to look at a registrar like Porkbun or Namecheap.

Common Domain Registration Terms Glossary
API: Application programming interface, a piece of software that basically acts as a bridge between other applications.
CDN: Content delivery network, sometimes called content distribution network. A CDN is a series of connected servers in different locations that store parts of your website data and deliver it to visitors based on their location to speed up load times.
DNS: Domain name system, a system that translates your IP address into your plain text domain name. Primarily governed by ICANN.
DNS Records: A series of text entries that explain to internet provider systems and browsers what domain name matches what IP address.
Domain Extension: Another term for a top-level domain (TLD), the part of a domain name that comes after the period at the end of the name.
Domain Name Server: A computer, or series of computers, that maintains the records about how IP addresses and domain names connect to each other.
ICANN: The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, a nonprofit organization that manages domain registries through its Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) division, controls top-level domain (TLD) availability, develops guidelines to stabilize and standardize the internet domain system and manages who can sell domain registrations.
IP Address: A series of numbers that identifies a specific computer, device or set of website records. There are two main types of IP addresses that vary in address length and security protocols. These are IPv4 (32-bit addresses) and IPv6 (128-bit addresses).
Pointing: Connected a domain name registered with one provider to web hosting with another provider. This is usually managed by changing the DNS records or by changing the nameservers.
Subdomain: A domain name dependent on another domain name. Standard domain names will have a series of letters followed by a period and then a domain extension. Subdomains add another series of letters and a period in front of the main domain name. A domain name would be example.com, while a subdomain would be subexample.example.com.
TLD: Top-level domain, sometimes called an extension or domain extension. These are the endings to your domain names, such as .com, .co, .uk and .org.
Transferring: Moving a domain registration from one registrar to another.
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
What is a domain registrar?
A domain registrar is a company that is authorized to register (rent) domain names and assign IP addresses to those domain names. They provide registrars with tools to manage ownership information, security, renewals and adjust DNS records. Domain registrars are authorized by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN).
Is a domain registrar and DNS provider the same thing?
No, while many domain registrars provide DNS services, they aren’t the same thing. Domain registration is leasing the domain name. DNS servers are where the domain name information is stored. Providers like DNSimple and Cloudflare offer DNS server packages with extra functions on top of the basic services that domain registrars often offer as part of a domain name bundle.
What is ICANN?
ICANN is the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers. It is a nonprofit organization of global stakeholders that controls top-level domain (TLD) availability, manages domain registries through its Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) division, certifies domain registrars and develops guidelines to stabilize and standardize the Internet domain system.
What’s the difference between pointing a domain and transferring a domain?
Pointing a domain means changing the DNS (domain name system) settings to point to your website. Transferring a domain means moving the domain registration to a new domain registrar.
Do I have to use my web host as my domain registrar?
With rare exceptions, you do not have to use your web host as your domain registrar. You can register your domain with one company and use a different web host. An exception to this rule is a subdomain website plan. Many free website builders supply a complimentary subdomain. If your plan only allows subdomains, you can not point a different domain name to that website.
How do I choose a domain name?
Choosing a domain name is a careful balancing act of picking an easy-to-remember (and spell) name, choosing the right TLD and following domain name rules. It’s the first step in registering a domain name, and it usually takes the longest. I always suggest coming up with several possible names before searching availability to avoid frustration.
What is a 60-day domain lock?
A 60-day lock is a temporary freeze on your ability to transfer your domain to another registrar for the first 60 days after the domain owner information is changed. Your domain registrar can, but is not required to, offer you the option of opting out of the lock. It was designed as a security measure to prevent bad actors from stealing domain names.
Someone bought my expired domain. Can I make them give it back?
No, once a domain has expired and been deleted from the active databases, anyone can buy the registration. In some cases, the new registrar may be willing to sell it to you for a profit, but, except for rare court rulings due to copyright and trademarks, you can’t force them to give it back.
How can I find the cheapest domain prices?
Domain name prices change very fast, and some companies offer cheap rates upfront, but renewal rates skyrocket. The best domain registration companies offer a balance between the two. The easiest way to compare them quickly is with a comparison tool like the one from get.shop during domain availability searches for .shop TLD names.
