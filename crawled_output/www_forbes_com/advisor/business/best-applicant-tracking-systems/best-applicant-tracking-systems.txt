Expert Take
100Hires’ entry-level Start plan serves new businesses and small companies that may feel shut out of high-priced applicant tracking systems. For only $99 a month, Start provides access to free and premium job boards and to the company’s extensive database containing more than 500 job descriptions for 28 different industries and job categories. Other lower-priced products in our rankings can’t match these and other features available from 100Hires.
While the Start plan is limited to three jobs and 100 candidates, it gives new operations a leg up in their efforts to attract quality job applicants using such advanced tools as candidate profile shortcuts, two-way email and calendar sync, a Chrome extension for bulk resume imports and the company’s AI-powered resume parser that generates candidate scores and profiles automatically. Once your company is ready to start hiring, you can upgrade to 100Hires’ Advanced or Pro plans at any time.

Users praise 100Hires for its user-friendly interface, intuitive design and time-saving features that simplify and automate the recruitment process. The platform’s integration with job boards and social media, notably its Chrome extension for LinkedIn, helps streamline candidate sourcing and management. Users also appreciate the customization options 100Hires provides that allow workflows and pipelines to be tailored to specific organizational needs. However, some users note that the product’s interface and advanced integrations are areas in need of improvement.
Pros & Cons

AI-powered resume parsing generates candidate scores and summaries automatically
Job description database includes hundreds of customizable industry-specific templates
Cluttered, text-heavy interface makes the system difficult to learn

Testing Insights
Hiring managers rely on automated resume parsing to prequalify candidates for their open positions, but the initial screening can still leave them with dozens of applicants to sift through. 100Hires’ AI-generated candidate scores help evaluators pare the list of potential hires by automatically parsing resumes to create candidate profiles that include ratings in specific categories relevant to the job.
The resume parser included with all 100Hires applicant tracking plans uses AI to generate scores representing the candidate’s abilities in specific areas.
When I tried out the resume parser, it took a while for me to become acclimated to the cluttered, text-heavy 100Hires interface. I also noticed some errors when I uploaded a resume to the service, such as adding the wrong first and last names of the applicant as “Page First.” Once you get up to speed on the product’s interface, however, it helps you quickly work through a stack of resumes by listing keyboard shortcuts for rating and qualifying candidates and performing other actions when you press the Shift key.
Still, the overall feel of the product reminded me of a software development toolkit: screens are so jam-packed with options that you have to scroll the pages to view them all. One exception is 100Hires’ reporting screen, which graphs six hiring metrics with a single click, including time to hire, current pipeline and disqualifications by stage and reason.

Expert Take
If you believe the old saying that well begun is half done, then you’ll make quick work of your recruiting by taking advantage of Workable’s job posting and candidate sourcing features. The company lets you post your open positions to more than 200 job boards in six languages, as well as to your own career site, including auto-fill applications, using its drag-and-drop page builder.
Workable’s library of more than 1,000 job description templates and free AI-based job description generator help set you up for success in your search for candidates. You can search the company’s database of 400 million candidate profiles or use its AI-based search tool to have candidates recommended for you. Your applicant search is easy to extend to social media by automatically sharing your job posts to the feeds of hundreds of passive candidates.

One thing recruiters will never have to worry about when using Workable’s candidate sourcing is running out of eligible applicants. When I tested the applicant tracking system using canned data, a search for account executive candidates generated a list of 109 potential hires. You needn’t be daunted by that number because it’s easy to sort and filter the list to surface the applicants who come closest to matching your requirements.
Workable’s AI-based candidate sourcing gives you many filtering options for surfacing the top candidates for open positions.
When you select candidates, a toolbar appears at the bottom of the window that lets you copy or move a job, contact candidates by email or text, send a video interview or assessment and delete or disqualify them. You can filter the candidate list by source (passive or active), assessment, interview or offer, and create custom filters based on location, years of experience or other job-related attributes. No other applicant tracking system I’ve tested can match Workable’s ability to find and identify top-qualified candidates so quickly and simply.

Breezy HR users highlight the product’s intuitive and user-friendly interface and its suitability for SMB applicant tracking. Reviewers are happy with Breezy HR’s automation features that enhance the recruitment process, especially for managing candidates through the hiring process. However, a common critique is the cost of the product’s advanced features, which can break the budgets of smaller businesses. Other reported problems relate to customer service and software bugs. Despite these drawbacks, most Breezy HR reviews are positive, highlighting the product’s affordability, efficiency and ease of use.

Testing Insights
Candidates for your company’s open positions are increasingly likely to reach you through job boards and social media, but many will still apply using your career site that cuts out the intermediary and lets you deliver a wow-factor first impression. Unlike the plain-jane career site builders included with most other applicant tracking systems, Breezy HR’s site-creation tools are both easy to use and capable of adding professional polish.
All the site-building options you need are grouped in the left pane of the main screen, including pages for introducing your company and its staff, icons representing your business’s perks and employee profiles and testimonials. Descriptions of your job openings appear on the site’s main page along with preconfigured links for applying through LinkedIn, Indeed and social media.
Easily customize the layout of your company’s career site using the drag-and-drop options in Breezy HR’s site-building tool.
The tool’s two standard layout options are Bold and Simple, but most organizations are better served by the default Bold layout, which offers more customization options and a brighter look. You can alter the site’s layout using Breezy HR’s drag-and-drop tools or by adding custom CSS and JavaScript. Other options let you alter the appearance of your job posts on social media with custom images for opening and position pages.

Hiring teams can quickly get lost in the applicant-tracking process as they coordinate their separate interviews and other activities with multiple candidates, and often multiple open positions. With JazzHR’s team messaging features and other quality collaboration tools, they get a centralized view of the entire team’s actions and applicant assessments, including the ability to create custom ranking systems for candidates and coordinate multiple calendars for interview scheduling and team meetings.
JazzHR gives small businesses a chance to scale their recruiting operations as they grow, starting with the Hero plan that costs $75 a month with an annual contract and lets you recruit three jobs at a time (each additional job search costs $9 a month). Hero comes with job posting and syndication, as well as custom recruiting workflows.
As your company grows, you can move up to the midrange Plus package for $269 a month with an annual contract that supports 200 active jobs. The Plus plan features AI-based candidate matching and reporting, but only JazzHR’s high-end Pro plan comes with a custom report builder, e-signature capability and an offer letter generator. However, candidate texting is sold as an add-on for all three plans.

JazzHR is frequently highlighted by users as a user-friendly and affordable applicant JazzHR users describe the product as user-friendly and affordable, making it particularly well-suited to the applicant tracking needs of small to medium-sized businesses. Many appreciate its easy setup, intuitive interface and customizable workflows, which streamline the recruitment process and improve efficiency. However, negative comments focus on customer support, subscription cancellations and limited advanced features such as detailed reporting and analytics. JazzHR offers good value for small businesses, but it may not meet the comprehensive needs of larger organizations that require robust HR functionalities.

JazzHR helps companies quickly form a hiring team and helps teams stay on the same page through the recruiting process. The level of permissions granularity possible with JazzHR’s roles and permissions exceeds those available with other applicant tracking systems in our rankings.
In particular, I was impressed by JazzHR’s ability to set roles and privileges for various members of a hiring team. They include administrators with full permissions, super users with fewer privileges and users with limited access to tools and data. All three user categories support internal (staff) and external (recruiter) participants.
JazzHR hiring team members can be assigned one of seven different roles with corresponding privileges.
While most applicant tracking systems require that you add people to the team individually, JazzHR saves your hiring team time by assigning entire groups to the team with a single click. The variety of roles you can assign team members give you more granularity than is available in other applicant tracking systems. For example, internal administrators have access to billing and account information that recruiting administrators can’t access, and super users and users see only the candidates for the jobs they’re assigned to rather than all of the company’s open jobs and applicant database.

Many of the applicant tracking software vendors in our rankings sell white label solutions to recruiting services and staffing agencies. AvaHR stands out by offering its own Autopilot hiring service that handles all aspects of recruiting and onboarding new hires. The service supports any number of job postings, candidates and U.S. locations. It comes with your own career site, scheduling of on-site interviews, pre-employment checks and candidate skills assessments.
However, the Autopilot service doesn’t make actual job offers, it doesn’t call references and it won’t help your business hire independent contractors. It does provide a dedicated account manager who works with you to create your job postings so they represent your company culture.

User reviews of AvaHR (formerly known as VIVAHR) praise the product’s ease of use, intuitive interface and cost-effectiveness for SMBs. They highlight its robust applicant tracking features, customization options and streamlined hiring process that lets companies post jobs to multiple platforms simultaneously. Users appreciate the company’s responsive and helpful customer support, although some note a lack of integrations and occasional delays in receiving candidate applications. The platform’s combination of ATS and CRM functionalities and its collaborative tools contribute to a seamless recruiting experience.

The more I found out about AvaHR while attempting to test its applicant tracking system, the less likely I was to recommend the product. The uneasy feeling began while attempting to sign up for the vendor’s seven-day free trial, which requires providing your credit card information. You don’t find out about this requirement until after you’ve created an account with the company.
Another unpleasant surprise was learning about the company’s fees for targeted campaigns on popular job boards, such as Monster and Glassdoor, that range from $99 to $299 for one month. There’s no reference to these fees on AvaHR’s pricing page, which states only that its plans include posting jobs to “50+ free job boards.”
AvaHR’s fees for targeted job advertising on popular job boards are out of reach for most small businesses.
Before I was able to find out anything about AvaHR’s applicant tracking options, I had to repeat an onerous registration process for the seven-day free trial three times because in my first two attempts, the email with the link to confirm my registration failed to arrive. Only after a successful third attempt did I find out that I would be charged automatically for the plan I chose to test after the trial period ended. Thanks but no thanks, AvaHR.

Anyone who has conducted a job interview knows that the introductions and Q&A pass so quickly that you can’t possibly remember the specifics of everything that occurred. A primary benefit of Lever’s AI Interview Companion is being able to relax while interviewing candidates and focus on the person rather than on furious note-taking.
At the conclusion of the job interview, the AI Interview Companion delivers a summary and overall score for the candidate based on their answers and sentiment in areas such as humility, communication and goal orientation. It also lists the highlights of the interview and where in the accompanying interview video the highlight occurs. Members of the hiring team receive immediate feedback on their interview skills, including suggestions for intuiting and responding to candidate’s feelings and reactions during the interview.

I was impressed with Lever’s AI-assisted interview analyzer, which made it easy for me to fill in the blanks by providing near total recall of the interview highlights. For each interview, the system generates an overall score along with a list of the person’s qualifications based on their answers. I also liked the fact that you get a candidate summary based on the interview transcript and a list of the interview highlights.
Lever’s AI-powered interview assistant captures important information about the candidate that human note-taking misses.
In addition to collecting interview feedback in real time, the AI Interview Companion helpfully assisted in my interview preparation by suggesting skills-based questions to ask the candidate and providing a level of standardization that helped prevent bias during the interview. I found that hiring team members will benefit from the system’s feedback that points out the interview interactions that they can improve, such as how to read and react to the candidate’s feelings and demeanor during the interview. This level of feedback isn’t available in the other applicant tracking systems in our rankings.

A company risks losing top candidates for its open jobs if its recruiting pipeline stalls, leaving applicants wondering whether they’re still in the running. With TeamTailor’s triggers, hiring teams are able to notify candidates automatically when their application progresses through each stage of the hiring process. This feature is a key component of TeamTailor’s candidate relationship management system that places all the information about job applicants on a single candidate card, including their resume, work history, interview notes, chat transcripts and all interactions with the candidate.
An advantage TeamTailor has over the other applicant tracking vendors in our rankings is its nurture campaigns that generate personalized messages to candidates automatically. Hiring managers are able to establish relationships with candidates early in the process and get them excited about joining their team. The campaigns are configured by assigning touch points and wait times that let you choreograph your contacts with applicants while promoting your team and your brand.

The trigger feature in TeamTailor’s applicant tracking systems saves hiring managers time while ensuring that job candidates are kept informed of their status as they proceed through the hiring process. For example, once an applicant passes the initial screening, you can set a trigger that sends the person an email notifying them of the next steps and asking for more information.
Let candidates know they’ve moved to the second phase of the recruitment process by activating a trigger that automates notifications and includes tests or requests for more information.
The trigger can be based on one of the company’s preconfigured templates that you customize to include aptitude and skills tests or to request job-related information. Triggers can be used by the hiring team to solicit comments on applicants, share schedules and to-do lists, and move candidates through the hiring pipeline automatically based on their answers to questions or other criteria.
I found the process of activating and applying triggers clear and straightforward despite the abundance of options presented through its nested menus and multi-option dialog boxes. You have to invest some time to learn to use triggers to automate actions, but once the triggers are in place, they promise to save hiring teams time while keeping applicants up to date on their status.

Expert Take
HiringThing specializes in selling white label applicant tracking systems to recruiting companies and staffing agencies rather than directly to SMBs. Professional recruiters add their brand and customizations to the HiringThing platform and use the company’s open API to develop links between the system and their internal processes. This makes HiringThing’s support during implementation and initial use the key to a smooth installation.
The quicker a recruiting office can deploy its branded applicant tracking system, the sooner it will realize its return on investment, so recruiting and staffing companies need to plan the process carefully. With HiringThing, the implementation begins with an introduction to the product and gathering information about the recruiter’s technical setup and work processes. HiringThing promises to have their white label system running within days of signing a contract, which is much faster than the industry average of four to eight weeks.

Converting HiringThing’s generic white-label applicant tracking system into a branded, customized engine that lets professional recruiters serve their business clients starts and ends with the HiringThing API. I took a look at the documentation for collecting data from custom fields in an application and retrieving assessments that are shared with the applicant.
HiringThing’s API can be used to gather application data and share assessments with job applicants.
Custom fields are used by administrators to create jobs or indicate that an applicant has been hired, while form builders are used by candidates to enter information in their applications. The latter are retrieved to generate assessments of the applicants that admins can share with them immediately or use to create candidate scores. An example assessment is shown below.
The HiringThing API can be used to collect and assess applicant data that is used to generate scores in various categories.

iSmart Recruit’s design demonstrates the principle of placing the most important thing front and center. The first module that appears at the top of the iSmart Recruit dashboard is a list of your company’s active jobs, which opens the product’s Jobs module. Here you’ll see at a glance the status of all positions you’re currently recruiting for, including the number of active and rejected applicants and successful hires. Options in this module let you share the job post on social media, request employee referrals and conduct passive searches for candidates using the candidate-match feature.
From the candidate module you can import resumes that match open jobs directly from email inboxes, spreadsheets or job boards such as Indeed and LinkedIn.
iSmart Recruit’s one-click resume import feature links automatically to popular job boards and email systems.
Other import options let you create a candidate database or add to an existing database by importing resumes directly from Excel spreadsheets. You can search the database for candidate matches using fuzzy searches and proximity searches, both of which identify close matches without requiring exact keywords.

Recruiting can sometimes feel like a numbers game: you have x number of candidates for y number of open positions leading to z number of new hires in d number of days. But attracting and hiring the best candidates for specific jobs can’t be measured in numbers alone. Rippling’s extensive library of recruiting-related report templates allows hiring managers to gain a deeper understanding of the effectiveness of their company’s applicant tracking and other recruiting operations quickly and simply.
Rippling targets three roles for its applicant tracking software, each with its own level of permissions: executives have full view and edit access to recruiting tools and information; hiring managers can be granted access to jobs, templates and candidate information pertaining to their open positions; and recruiters can be granted permissions based on the teams or departments they interact with. All hiring team members are provided with personalized dashboards showing the status of applicants throughout the hiring process.

Quality reports make dull data come to life. While testing the product, I found that Rippling’s extensive library of customizable reports let you convert applicant-related information into eye-popping graphics that tell a story at a glance. For example, I was able to review the status of my fictional company’s overall recruiting and hiring activities in a table with interminable rows and columns. I was also able to use Rippling’s recruiting pipeline report template to communicate the information in color-coded charts indicating the number of applicants at each stage of the hiring process by department.
Rippling’s customizable reports present applicant and recruitment status clearly and completely.
Other recipe templates automatically notify hiring managers when a new employee’s work authorization is pending or received. They can also be used to send reminders and notifications of a candidate’s offer letter approaching its expiration date and to notify top executives when a new hire has accepted their offer. Rippling prides itself on taking a “data-driven approach to recruiting,” and its advanced analytics and report builder deliver on this promise by making powerful data-analysis tools accessible to hiring managers.
Methodology
To identify the best applicant tracking systems, we evaluated 57 products from 22 vendors based on 40 separate parameters. I then conducted hands-on testing of the 10 applicant tracking systems that ranked the highest after the initial round to try out their most important features and identify the areas where each stands out from the pack. The range of options offered by our top 10 picks ensures that one of our selections will be a good fit for your small or midsize business.

How To Choose the Best Applicant Tracking System
Like most business endeavors, shopping for an applicant tracking system begins with a plan that identifies the people who will manage and use the system, the benefits your company expects to realize and the budget for the acquisition.
Essential Applicant Tracking System Features
Applicant tracking system features fall into four categories:
Attracting and engaging candidates. This includes links to job boards, job advertisements, employee referrals and possibly working with a recruiting or staffing agency. Workable’s candidate sourcing features links to more than 200 job boards and access to the company’s database of 400 million candidate profiles. Breezy HR and iSmart Recruit are also noteworthy for their job-posting features.
Hiring team collaboration and candidate screening. AI-based resume screening from vendors such as 100Hires automates the process of qualifying candidates, while JazzHR’s automated feedback system keeps hiring team members updated on the status of candidates through the recruitment process.
Applicant tracking integrations. Nearly all applicant tracking systems integrate with other business processes, whether as a component of a comprehensive HRIS from a vendor such as Rippling, or through use of APIs and other development tools provided by vendors such as HiringThing, Lever and Breezy HR. They also offer libraries of third-party integrations with job boards and other external systems, which is an area where iSmart Recruit stands out.
Reporting and analytics. Typical applicant tracking reports include time to hire, source effectiveness, offer acceptance rate, applicant funnel conversion rates and cost per hire. The reporting options available from Rippling are noteworthy for being easy to customize and providing a range of graphical data representations.
Value
The variation in pricing models used by applicant tracking system vendors complicates the selection process. Some base their prices on the number of employees at your company, while others are priced based on the number of job openings you have or the number of users of the system. Small business owners can expect to spend between $100 and $400 a month on their applicant tracking system cost, although startups can benefit from the free plans such as Breezy HR’s Bootstrap package that’s limited to a single position or pool, JazzHR’s low-cost Hero plan or 100Hires’ high-value Start plan.
Which Applicant Tracking System Is Best for Your Business?
For many small businesses, the best option for filling their open positions is to work with a professional recruiting company or staffing agency because their volume of new hiring can’t justify the expense of a complete applicant tracking system. The overall cost of hiring an employee ranges from $3,000 for entry-level positions to more than $25,000 for high-level executives.
By contrast, recruiters typically charge between 15% and 25% of the position’s first-year salary. For companies that have fewer than 10 open jobs a year, outsourcing their recruiting can be an economical alternative to an in-house applicant tracking system. However, affordable entry-level applicant tracking solutions from vendors such as 100Hires and JazzHR give small businesses control over the hiring process without putting a big dent in their operating budget.
Organizations with growth plans or that anticipate a high rate of hiring are well served by the comprehensive applicant tracking products available from Workable that provide them with a competitive edge through such features as AI-assisted candidate recommendations and automated social media promotion. Similarly, the candidate relationship management features and automated candidate sourcing available from iSmart Recruit and TeamTailor help companies improve the quality of applicants and reduce their time to hire.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
How do small businesses use applicant tracking systems?
Small businesses use applicant tracking systems to reduce the time and effort required to find, assess and hire top candidates for their open jobs. The systems foster communication between hiring teams and candidates, and ensure that the companies comply with all employment regulations.
How do applicant tracking systems score resumes?
Applicant tracking systems score resumes by looking for “knockout questions” that disqualify applicants, such as willingness to relocate or to work full time. Resumes are then scored based on the candidate’s skills, experience, education, certifications and licenses, and location.
How do applicant tracking systems support hiring teams?
Hiring teams use applicant tracking systems to improve their sharing of candidate information throughout the recruitment process. The teams usually include an HR representative, the hiring manager and other employees in the job opening’s department. Applicant information may reside outside of other production and support systems at the company, so the systems centralize hiring-related information and tools, such as interview calendars and candidate assessments.
