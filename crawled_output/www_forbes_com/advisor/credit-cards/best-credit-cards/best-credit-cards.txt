Editorial Note: We earn a commission from partner links on Forbes Advisor. Commissions do not affect our editors' opinions or evaluations.
While no single credit card is the best option for every family, purchase or budget, the experts on our credit cards team set out to crunch the numbers to find the top cards for various needs.
We gathered more than 28,000 data points across 400-plus cards, created our own editorial rating system and compiled the best credit cards. These top 10 credit cards are among those we found to be the most helpful to the widest variety of readers. Rather than selecting a single card for all customers, we used our credit card rankings to highlight the best credit card for different situations.
You can read more about our methodology here.

Our Expert Take
The Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card is a simple travel solution with valuable rewards rates and a reasonable annual fee. You have access to all types of redemptions with this card, like a fantastic 1:1 rate when transferring Chase Ultimate Rewards® to travel partners. But you also can pay with points through Chase Travel℠ if transfers aren’t your preference—opt for Points Boost redemptions worth up to 1.75 cents per point on select purchases. It also offers comprehensive travel protections, up to $50 in statement credits annually toward hotel stays booked with Chase Travel and a points bonus each anniversary year worth 10% of your total spending.
Pros & Cons
Earn elevated rewards in practical spending categories
Transfer points to over a dozen partners at a rate of 1:1
Top of the line protections for travel and purchases
$95 annual fee
No introductory APR offer
Must book through Chase Travel℠ for best earning rate on travel

The Chase Freedom Flex® offers up to 5% in cash-back earnings without rewards expiration dates or an annual fee. The addition of a few 3% categories makes it even more interesting.

Cardholders can also receive cellphone protection of up to $800 per claim and $1,000 per year (a $50 deductible applies).
Pros & Cons

Our Expert Take
Customers with existing debt will appreciate the Citi Double Cash® Card. It offers a long runway to pay off what you owe with an introductory APR on balance transfers: 0% intro APR on balance transfers for 18 months. After that, the standard variable APR will be 17.99% to 27.99%, based on creditworthiness. An intro balance transfer fee of either $5 or 3%, whichever is greater, applies to transfers completed within the first 4 months of account opening. After that, the fee will be 5% of each transfer (minimum $5). But unlike other balance transfer cards, you may want to hang onto this one long afterward since it earns strong, flat-rate cash back on every purchase.
Pros & Cons
Earn up to 2% cash back—1% when the purchase is made and 1% when payment is made on the account
Unlimited cash back
No annual fee
Introductory APR period for balance transfers
Great opportunity to pair with other Citi credit cards
Foreign transaction fee
Balance transfer fee
Lack of benefits seen in other no annual fee cards
No introductory APR on purchases

Balance Transfer Only Offer: 0% intro APR on Balance Transfers for 18 months. After that, the variable APR will be 17.99% – 27.99%, based on your creditworthiness.
Balance Transfers do not earn cash back. Intro APR does not apply to purchases.
If you transfer a balance, interest will be charged on your purchases unless you pay your entire balance (including balance transfers) by the due date each month.

If standard household expenses are eating away at your budget, the Blue Cash Preferred® Card from American Express (Terms apply, see rates & fees) can help. You’ll earn industry-leading cash-back rates at U.S. supermarkets and above-average returns at U.S. gas stations—two heavy expenses for families. Cash back is received in the form of Reward Dollars that can be redeemed as a statement credit and at Amazon.com checkout. An underrated perk of the Blue Cash Preferred—and other Amex cards—is the ability to access Amex Offers (enrollment required), which provide targeted rebates or bonus cash deals on purchases from select retailers.

Since Amazon.com is such a ubiquitous part of everyday life in many households, the Prime Visa barely even feels like it should be labeled as the best store credit card rather than a catch-all solution. With this card, you’ll earn competitive rates on Amazon purchases that are unmatched by other cards. Cardholders can choose between earning generous rewards or paying over time without interest on select Amazon purchases.

Our Expert Take
The introductory APR offer on the U.S. Bank Cash+® Visa Signature® Card* is first-rate for a no-annual-fee card. It applies to both new purchases and balance transfers: Get a 0% intro APR on purchases and balance transfers for 15 billing cycles, then a standard 18.24% to 28.49% variable APR applies. A balance transfer fee of 5% ($5 minimum) applies and balances transferred must be completed within 60 days from account opening. The cash-back rates are also admirable, and the eligible bonus categories cover some uncommon options, like department stores and fitness centers. Even if you already have another cash-back card, this card can be an excellent complement.

Methodology for Evaluating the Best Credit Card Welcome Offers
The best credit card deals for the week of August 25, 2025, were chosen based on the value of the welcome bonus, taking into account Forbes Advisor’s points and miles valuations for airline and hotel programs. Conduct informed research before deciding which cards will help you achieve your financial goals.
Types of Credit Cards in 2025
Although all credit cards can be used to make purchases, there are several different types of credit cards, each designed for a different goal.
Rewards Credit Cards
A rewards credit card earns a percentage back on your spending, in the form of cash back, points or miles. The exact amount you’ll earn can vary greatly by card, with some earning the same flat rate back on all of your spending and others offering tiered rewards with certain purchase categories earning elevated rates over other categories. See our list of the best rewards credit cards of 2025.
Since there are many types of credit card points—and countless earning structures—there’s a lot to consider when choosing a card. Learning how credit card points work can help you find the right card for your preferred rewards.
I travel frequently, and the unmatched lounge access benefits provided by The Platinum Card® from American Express is one of the reasons why I keep this card.
– Caroline Lupini, Forbes Advisor Managing Editor
0% APR Credit Cards
A 0% APR credit card offers an introductory 0% interest period on either new purchases, balance transfers from other cards or both. Think of a zero-APR offer like an interest-free loan with an expiration date. If used responsibly, it gives you a cushion of time to pay off what you owe without accumulating additional finance charges. But the zero-interest period doesn’t last forever. When it expires, your balance will accrue interest at the card’s standard variable rate.
See our list of the best 0% APR credit cards of 2025.
Balance Transfer Credit Cards
A balance transfer card offers a low or 0% APR on transfers made to the card for an introductory period of time. There may be a balance transfer fee of 3% to 5% to shift debt from one card to another. After that introductory period, the card’s standard variable APR will typically apply to any remaining balance.
See our list of the best balance transfer cards of 2025.
Transferring an existing credit card balance to a new card with an introductory 0% interest rate is one of the very best ways to start pulling yourself out of credit card debt. However, make sure you have a plan to pay off your debt before the introductory interest rate expires. Calculate in advance how much you’ll need to pay each month so that the debt is gone before the interest rate jumps and then stick to paying that amount starting from the very first month you have the card.
– Julian Kheel, Credit Card Expert
Low-Interest Credit Cards
A low-interest credit card has a lower ongoing interest rate compared to the typical APR on other cards. Unlike 0% APR cards, the low interest rate typically extends indefinitely rather than expiring after a year or two. For those who regularly carry a balance on their cards, this may be a more beneficial option than a limited-time 0% APR.
Student Credit Cards
Since they are marketed to college students, student credit cards are usually designed for first-time cardholders with limited credit history and, potentially, limited income. This means you’re likely to qualify with less credit history than the standard version of the card would require. These cards are otherwise very similar to standard cards and may offer rewards, travel benefits or even perks like cash bonuses for good grades.
See our list of the best student credit cards of 2025.
Credit Cards To Build Credit
When you’re just starting with credit or you’re seeking to move past credit missteps, there are credit cards aimed at helping you prove responsible payment behavior to boost your credit profile. The best starter credit card for you will provide a balance between benefits, such as reporting to the credit bureaus, and costs to carry, including annual fees or any other maintenance costs.
Business Credit Cards
A business credit card can be a great way to separate your personal expenses from your work ones, even if it’s just a part-time gig. When you apply for a small business credit card, your approval will be based on your personal credit score. It also means you’ll be personally liable for any debts accrued on the card. The issuer will also consider other factors when reviewing your application, including your business income and credit history.
See our list of the best business credit cards of 2025.
What Credit Card Should I Get?
Different types of credit card users will benefit most from different types of credit cards. Here are tips to help you decide which is the best credit card for you.
Value Shoppers
Value shoppers will likely benefit most from cash-back cards that provide rewards on everyday purchases. These cardholders will want to minimize annual fees and aren’t concerned about travel rewards or high-end perks. Check out the best cards for shopping and best cards for groceries to learn more.
Travelers
The best travel credit card of 2025 will vary based on the kind of traveler you are. If you like to play “license plate ABC,” check out our best cards for road trips. If you prefer traveling at 35,000 feet, check out the best airline credit cards of 2025. Travel rewards cards often have top welcome bonus offers.
First-Time Applicants
When you’re just starting out, it can feel like a Catch-22. You need good credit to get a credit card, but you need a credit card to build credit. Fortunately, there are some cards out there that are good for both those starting out and those needing to get back on track. Check out our best first credit cards.
Students
College students have a plethora of credit card options because the banks understand the value of a lifetime customer. Many of these cards act as little siblings to their standard rewards card counterparts, giving students a chance to earn strong rewards without needing as much of a credit history. Check out the best credit cards for students.
Business Owners
Whether it’s a roadside stand or a shop on Etsy, small businesses have unique credit needs. Business credit cards offer benefits tailored to commerce and offer a way to keep personal and business expenses separate. If you are just starting out, one of our best cards for new businesses may do the trick.
Brand Loyalists
If you only stay at Hyatt hotels or only shop at Pottery Barn, it may make sense for you to pick up a co-branded credit card for that store, airline or hotel chain. Cardholders may also want to continue working with a financial institution they have other accounts with.
If you are loyal to one of the best credit card companies, you can limit your card search accordingly:

How To Choose a Credit Card
Since hundreds of cards are available, putting some effort into choosing a credit card is essential for finding the right one for your needs. Start by defining your financial goals, whether that’s earning rewards, rebuilding credit or lowering your APR. Then you’ll want to check your credit score and use that to inform which card options may be available to you. From there, consider your tolerance for annual fees, what perks you might be seeking and how any rewards offered with the card would fit with your spending habits.
Once you’ve chosen a card, you can apply for it in a few easy steps.

We are a household that uses Amazon on the regular so my Prime Visa gets a good workout. I love that I earn 5% back on all my spending and the two-day shipping is key for the many last-minute projects my kids suddenly remember to tell me about.

I love the Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card for so many reasons, but a handful of benefits set it above my other cards. For one, the 3X points for online groceries is a staple in my home. As a busy mom of four, online grocery shopping has saved my life, and earning bonus Ultimate Rewards on it is just the icing on the cake.
And speaking of Ultimate Rewards, give me all of them. Thanks to these incredibly flexible points, I’ve been able to show my family the world.
Toni Perkins-Southam

Lately, I’ve been relying on my Citi Strata Premier® Card. Nearly every purchase I make earns triple points, which boosts my morale to see my rewards balance grow so quickly. I love transferring my rewards to travel partners—the Choice Hotels option in particular has helped me plan trips at exceptionally great values with no cash out of pocket.

How Does Credit Card Interest Work?
Most credit cards calculate interest using the average daily balance method:
Average daily balance method. Your credit card balance is multiplied by the card’s specified daily interest rate each day, then each day’s interest amount is added together for a monthly charge.
If the math trips you up, you can use our credit card interest calculator to do the work for you.
How To Get the Most From Your Credit Card
Credit cards provide everything from consumer protections to valuable benefits and substantial earnings potential. Using your credit card correctly will help you save on fees and keep your credit in good standing. You can also apply strategies to maximize credit card rewards and look for card perks that match your lifestyle to enhance the value you get from a credit card.
The biggest mistake most people make when it comes to getting the most from their credit card is keeping the same card in their wallet for years on end. The credit card marketplace is incredibly dynamic, and the card that was right for you a decade ago probably isn’t the best choice for you today. That’s why I recommend checking at least every few years to see if there’s a better credit card available than the one you currently have.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
What is the easiest credit card to get?
Secured credit cards are typically the easiest to get, since they are designed for people who have limited or damaged credit histories. Anyone with average or better credit may be approved for certain traditional, unsecured credit cards. Typically, cards with no or low rewards have less stringent application requirements. You can check for personalized preapproved offers to improve your odds.
Which credit card is best for me?
Finding the best credit card for you requires considering and evaluating your own financial needs. Start by assessing your credit score and history to understand which types of cards you may be approved for. Then, within those cards, look at annual fees, rewards rates and other benefits to determine which best fit your lifestyle.
How many credit cards should I have?
Some people may do fine with a single, well-chosen credit card. Other customers may carry two or more credit cards to take advantage of complementary rewards and benefits. When choosing how many credit cards to have, don’t forget to consider how many you can realistically manage and pay on time.
