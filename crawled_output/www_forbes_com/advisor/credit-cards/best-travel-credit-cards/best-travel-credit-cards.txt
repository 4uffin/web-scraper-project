Editorial Note: We earn a commission from partner links on Forbes Advisor. Commissions do not affect our editors' opinions or evaluations.
The right travel card can turn everyday spending into free flights, hotel stays and unforgettable experiences. But with a sea of options, many with high annual fees, how do you know which ones are truly worth it?
To find the best credit cards for travel, we began with a pool of over 400 credit cards and narrowed it down to 140 options that earn points or miles redeemable for travel. We then categorized these cards into three distinct groups—flexible rewards cards, airline cards and hotel cards. Using public data and personal experience, our credit card experts assigned a valuation to each card’s rewards currency to estimate its potential value and pinpoint the top options in each category. Our editorial team also provided tips on comparing travel cards and pitfalls to avoid.
Why You Can Trust Forbes Advisor
Our editors are committed to bringing you unbiased ratings and information. Advertisers do not and cannot influence our ratings. We use data-driven methodologies to evaluate financial products and companies, so all are measured equally. You can read more about our editorial guidelines and the credit card methodology for the ratings below.

For example, enjoy up to $300 in annual travel credit, up to $300 for dining with Sapphire Reserve Exclusive Tables, up to $500 for The Edit hotel collection bookings and up to $300 with StubHub each year.

The Platinum Card® from American Express (Terms apply, see rates & fees) is designed for frequent travelers who will fully leverage its rich travel benefits—trust me when I say the perks can make you feel like a VIP. The staggering annual fee for this classic status card won’t be worth it for everyone, but in the right hands, the expense is easily justified. Lounge access with this card extends well beyond the Priority Pass membership you see on other premium cards. Plus, if you’re looking for a giant welcome bonus to get things started, the Platinum Card delivers.
Pros & Cons
Includes luxury perks and exclusive benefits
Over 20 airline and hotel transfer partners
Enjoy access to Amex’s Global Lounge Collection
Sky-high annual fee

We love that the Wells Fargo Autograph Journey℠ Card (rates & fees) bestows strong earning rates on travel without requiring you to book through a card’s portal. This card has a minimal annual fee and offers the opportunity to earn a $50 statement credit each year when you spend $50 or more on airline purchases. That’s a bargain all air travelers will love. However, with a limited number of transfer partners, you’ll have fewer redemption options than what other issuers offer.

With The New United Quest℠ Card*, perks fly far further than the basics. Cardholders get a $200 United® travel credit and a 10,000-mile discount on United award flights each year starting on their first anniversary. You’ll also get two free checked bags on United flights and can unlock extras—like two global Economy Plus® upgrades—by spending $40,000 in a calendar year. Plus, you’ll receive 1,000 Premier qualifying points annually starting in 2026 and can earn up to 18,000 more PQPs per year at a rate of 1 PQP per $20 spent.

While Hyatt doesn’t have an extensive network of properties compared to other chains, the value offered by The World of Hyatt Credit Card* is outstanding.

The card comes with five elite qualifying night credits, but cardholders can earn more through spending to work their way up the elite ladder.

Best Travel Credit Cards Methodology
Forbes Advisor considered dozens of airline, hotel and flexible-rewards credit cards to create this list of the best travel credit cards. The primary factors taken into consideration for all types were:
Estimated annual earnings—25% to 50% depending on card category
Welcome bonus—15% to 25% depending on card category
Travel benefits—15% to 25% depending on card category
Annual fee—5% to 15% depending on card category
Consumer benefits—0% to 10% depending on card category
Foreign transaction fee—0% to 5% depending on card category
The hotel earnings rate was weighted 25% for hotel credit cards and the airline earnings rate was weighted 15% for airline credit cards. Earning potential on each card is determined using average American spending amounts based on data from multiple government agency reports. We use the same data for all card calculations to ensure cards are compared equally.
The top travel rewards credit cards list is reevaluated at least every few months to determine if any cards need to be added or removed. Demand for travel rewards cards is high, and competition remains strong among issuers offering benefits aimed at meeting travelers’ wishes. This means card benefits get updated frequently, and we evaluate each card’s update to determine how it might fit into this list.

How Do Travel Credit Cards Work?
A travel rewards credit card accrues miles or points for each purchase made with the card. Every card has a different earning and redemption structure.
A co-branded card, like one labeled with Marriott or Southwest, will earn rewards in the specifically named travel brand.
General travel cards may instead earn flexible bank points, like those you see with Chase Ultimate Rewards® or American Express Membership Rewards®.
Here’s how credit card points and miles work:
Earn rewards when you make purchases. Nearly all purchases on a card will earn rewards at the rate specified by the card. Rates may vary based on the type of purchase.
Rewards are deposited into your account. Most cards update your rewards balance once per month after your billing statement closes. On co-branded cards, travel rewards are typically deposited into your existing airline or hotel account automatically.
Consider your reward options. The value of airline and hotel points often depends on the specific redemption. Before you redeem points or miles, ensure you’re happy with the value you’ll receive
Make a redemption. Depending on the redemption type, you might need to use your credit card issuer’s portal or your preferred travel partner.
There are many other intricacies to redeeming miles and points, so if you’re not confident about all your options, you’ll want to review the opportunities from your program before committing to a redemption.
Types of Travel Credit Cards
Not all travel credit cards are alike. Here’s how the various types break down so you can choose which type of rewards card is best for your unique circumstances.
Transferable Rewards Credit Cards
These types of credit cards earn rewards that can be transferred to other programs, like airline or hotel loyalty programs. Transferable rewards include Capital One Rewards, Bilt Rewards, Brex Rewards, Chase Ultimate Rewards®, American Express Membership Rewards, Wells Fargo Rewards and Citi ThankYou® Points.
Airline Credit Cards
Airline credit cards earn miles that can be used to redeem for future purchases with that airline. You can also use that airline’s miles to book flights with partners, which may yield more award opportunities. Some common airline credit card extras may include free checked baggage, priority boarding, a TSA PreCheck® or Global Entry application fee credit and airport lounge access. If you can max out these extras, the perks can often be worth more than the annual fee.
Some popular airline cards include co-branded American Airlines credit cards, Delta credit cards, Southwest credit cards and United credit cards.
Hotel Credit Cards
With hotel cards, you’ll earn rewards in the hotel’s currency, like Marriott Bonvoy points, Hilton Honors points or World of Hyatt points, which are redeemable toward any eligible hotel property under that brand’s umbrella. Some cards also confer automatic elite status upon ownership, which comes with benefits that can range from late checkout to free breakfast to room upgrades. Additionally, many cards offer one night free annually every time you renew your card membership, as well as other perks such as airport lounge access.
If you’re looking specifically for co-branded hotel cards, you may want to consider the best Hyatt credit cards or the best Marriott credit cards.
Fixed-Value Credit Cards
Credit card points may often have a fixed value when redeemed for things like cash back or travel, where the issuer publishes the cash value per point. For example, a card may offer a value of a penny per point when redeemed for any valid travel purchase. Fixed-value points currencies can also vary by redemption type. For example, points on a card might be worth 1.5 cents each when redeemed for travel rewards but only be worth 1 cent each when redeemed for cash back.
Business Credit Cards for Travel
If you’re traveling for work and you want to keep your business expenses separate from your personal expenses, a travel business credit card may be worth considering. Business credit cards for travel function the same as consumer credit cards for travel, although the business versions often offer different earning rates and perks, and have a different annual fee structure.
Ask an Expert
Is it better to choose a flexible travel rewards card or one branded to a specific airline or hotel?

Clint Proctor
Credit Cards Lead Editor
Becky Pokora
Credit Cards Writer
If I had to choose, I’d say flexible travel rewards because it allows for much more versatility in your redemption options beyond just flights and hotel stays. But the best approach is to have both. You can maximize benefits from each card type by earning rewards across all of the spending you normally do, while getting perks with your favorite travel providers at the same time.
Yanely Espinal
Credit Cards Expert
Since I’m not particularly loyal to any airline or hotel, I prefer the flexibility of general travel cards. I especially appreciate travel cards that offer transfers to travel partners. With flexible rewards, I can access 10 to 20 or more loyalty programs from a single card. This increases my chances of being able to take advantage of the best award deals that are available for my next trip.
Clint Proctor
Credit Cards Lead Editor
I love that most co-branded travel cards include benefits when booking with that brand. Free night certificates on hotel cards and free checked bags with airlines are valuable perks. Plus, even though earning a single type of point might seem limited, big hotel chains have more than a dozen brand choices and airlines may have 10 or more alliance partners, so you’ll still find plenty of versatility.

How To Compare Travel Credit Cards
When comparing travel credit cards, items to consider include:
1. Annual fee
The annual fee on credit cards ranges from zero to several hundred dollars. In general, the more expensive the card, the richer the perks and rewards.
2. Foreign transaction fee
Foreign transaction fees can be an additional 3% to 5% surcharge when making transactions in other currencies, such as when you’re traveling abroad. The best no foreign transaction fee cards avoid this surcharge.
3. Sign-up bonus
One-time offers to new cardholders can be extremely lucrative and an important factor in determining which cards appeal to you.
4. Rewards rate
Different cards have different earning rates, both in the amount you earn with every purchase and the form of rewards—points, miles or cash back.
5. International acceptance
When traveling outside the United States, Visa and Mastercard tend to be more widely accepted than American Express or other cards. Therefore, international travelers may wish to pick their card type accordingly.
6. Travel protections
Included travel insurance could save you money compared to separately purchased policies but won’t necessarily be comprehensive. If you travel often, you might consider the best credit cards with travel insurance.
7. Perks
Benefits range from airport lounge access to statement credit reimbursements for certain purchases.

What’s your favorite travel credit card and why?
Adam Sterling

One of my favorite travel credit cards is the Chase Sapphire Reserve® because it has many useful benefits. Two benefits stand out in particular. First, it grants cardholders access to Sapphire Lounge by The Club locations, which are some of the newest airport lounges in the U.S. Second, it offers trip delay insurance, which covers travelers when their eligible trip is delayed by more than six hours.
Adam Sterling
Credit Cards Expert
The Chase Sapphire Reserve® is my go-to for travel bookings. Between the high rewards rate, travel protections and transfer partners, it’s a no-brainer for me.
Robin Frankel
Credit Cards Writer
The Citi Strata Premier® Card is a favorite for me because you can earn at high rates on daily, non-travel expenses at home but then turn around and redeem your points for a nearly limitless number of travel redemptions.
Becky Pokora

How To Maximize Credit Card Points for Travel
You’ll need to take a multipronged approach to maximize your credit card rewards.
1. Choose a Card That Matches Your Spending and Travel Habits
You’ll want to use a card (or cards) that offer bonus points in spending categories that are meaningful to you. It’s also important to ensure the type of rewards you earn—whether that’s miles or points specific to a certain airline or hotel, or more flexible rewards—also lines up with your travel style.
I most commonly pull out my Citi Strata Premier® Card to earn bonus points on regular, daily expenses I have at home, like gas, groceries and dining. For other expenses that don’t earn at bonus rates on that card, my other go-to is the Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card (rates & fees) since it earns 2X on everything, regardless of how a particular merchant codes the purchase. Both of these are flexible rewards cards, so I don’t need to be brand loyal with a specific airline or hotel. This works out best for me since I hop around brands based on which is best for a specific trip.
2. Use Your Credit Card To Cover as Many Expenses as Possible
You’ll need to use your credit card to make payments regularly to earn a meaningful number of points. Using credit instead of debit or cash can also offer extra purchase protections, which is another perk. Just remember: Credit cards have high APRs and other potential fees, so you’ll only want to use them if you expect to pay the balance off quickly. Otherwise, your potential rewards earnings will be offset by the cost of interest charges.
3. Learn Your Redemption Options
Maximizing your travel credit card rewards involves learning the ins and outs of your card’s related loyalty programs since some redemptions can be worth more than others. On co-branded airline and hotel cards, this might mean reading award chart prices or doing a little research on available options for your specific trip before clicking the “Redeem Now” button.
For flexible rewards cards, you may also want to dig into the value per point for different redemptions. Some points are worth 1 cent each toward cash redemptions, but others may only be worth half a penny each unless used for travel. That’s a significant difference if you’re cashing out a lot of points! Additionally, both programs have different partner lists if you want to transfer your miles.
Most often, I transfer miles from my credit card to an airline to book international airfare. I’ve taken time to learn the sweet spots of each program, where I might find a better ticket at a lower price. But I’ve also learned one major reality of rewards travel: The best value is sometimes the ticket that’s available to your destination on your dates, even if it’s not the fanciest, fastest or absolute lowest price. Value is subjective, so make sure to customize options to your needs.

What is the most underrated benefit of travel credit cards that is often overlooked?
Jerod Morales
Credit Cards Editor
Troy Liu
Credit Cards And Loyalty Programs Expert
Becky Pokora
Credit Cards Writer
Some of the benefits of travel cards I rely on that don’t get much attention are the travel and purchase protections. I always make sure to book travel with a card that includes things like trip cancellation/interruption insurance, trip delay protection and lost or delayed baggage benefits. It’s not always a substitute for separate travel insurance, but it can go a long way to getting compensation when travel goes awry.
Jerod Morales
Credit Cards Editor
I feel cellphone insurance is overlooked by some travelers and followed by travel insurance coverage. Many credit cards even cover the trip if you just pay taxes on a reward ticket.
Troy Liu
Credit Cards And Loyalty Programs Expert
Free nights, big bonuses and statement credits get all the attention but one perk that goes unnoticed is the option to add authorized users to your card account at a reduced cost. That extends benefits like airport lounge access to a household member, even if they’re not traveling with you.
Becky Pokora
Credit Cards Writer
Are Travel Credit Cards Worth It?
Generally speaking, yes, travel credit cards are worth it if you travel regularly. You’ll be able to earn rewards on every purchase and later redeem those rewards toward future trips—often at a higher yield than cash back. Many travel cards also include benefits to enhance your travel experience along the way to add even more value.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
What is the easiest travel credit card to get?
Most travel credit cards require good to excellent credit scores (a good credit score starts at 670 according to the FICO scoring model). Travel cards with no annual fee are typically easier to be approved for than ultrapremium travel cards with high annual fees.
How many travel credit cards should I have?
The number of travel credit cards you should have depends on how often you travel, which benefits you value, your financial situation and whether you’re willing to spend time tracking multiple cards. Frequent travelers can find value in holding at least one travel card but may consider holding several. For example, having both an airline card and a hotel card can provide complementary benefits and the ability to earn rewards for all aspects of your travel plans.
How can you travel for free with credit cards?
Travel with credit card points can save you a lot of money on travel compared to paying full price. A combination of welcome bonus offers, the rewards you earn from everyday spending and included statement credits can add up to hundreds of dollars in value toward free travel.
Alternatively, you might have airline companion certificates or hotel free night certificates, which work more like a coupon. In either case, you’ll need to learn the rules of your specific program to maximize your card’s travel benefits and get the most possible value.
