Editorial Note: We earn a commission from partner links on Forbes Advisor. Commissions do not affect our editors' opinions or evaluations.
Credit cards may come with perks, protections and conveniences, but double-digit APRs make them an expensive way to pay over time. Introductory APR cards help you sidestep those interest charges—at least temporarily—while you pay down debt or finance big purchases.
We dug through our database of over 400 credit cards to search for 0% APR cards. We analyzed each interest-free window, whether it applied to new purchases or balance transfers (or both), what fees might apply and the card’s overall value from other factors like annual costs and rewards potential. The zero can be a hero when it comes to interest charges, but the best 0% APR credit cards hold up once that intro period ends.
Why you can trust Forbes Advisor
Our credit card editors are committed to bringing you unbiased ratings and information. Advertisers do not and cannot influence our ratings. We use data-driven methodologies to evaluate financial products and companies, so all are measured equally. You can read more about our editorial guidelines and the credit card methodology for the ratings below.

Our Expert Take
Intro APR Offer: Get a 0% intro APR on purchases and balance transfers for 15 billing cycles, then a standard 18.24% to 28.49% variable APR applies. A balance transfer fee of 5% ($5 minimum) applies and balances transferred must be completed within 60 days from account opening.
The U.S. Bank Cash+® Visa Signature® Card*’s top-tier rewards are exceptional for a card without an annual fee. It lets you pick two spending categories from a long list of eligible options that can earn up to 5% (on your first $2,000 in combined purchases each quarter). It’s a win-win when any of those categories line up with purchases you’re financing with the card’s intro APR offer. Categories even include a few options that are rarely eligible for high rewards on credit cards, such as furniture stores, electronic stores and sporting goods stores.
Pros & Cons

2% cash back in different eligible categories

Unlike other cards, maximizing cash back here doesn’t require activating or opting in each quarter to bonus categories. There’s also no annual fee to eat into your rewards.

Intro APR Offer: Get a 0% introductory APR for 15 months on purchases and eligible balance transfers. Then, a standard rate of 18.24% to 27.24% variable applies. A balance transfer fee of up to 5% of the amount transferred applies.
The Cashback Match™ welcome offer on the Discover it® Cash Back takes longer to receive than the typical upfront new cardholder offer, but it could add up to tremendous earnings in the first year—especially if you plan to make some major purchases during that time. It also offers rotating quarterly 5% rewards categories (up to $1,500 in combined category spending per quarter, activation required) that typically have wide appeal. Examples of eligible spending categories have included supermarkets, gas stations and warehouse clubs. That gives this card staying power beyond its intro APR offer on purchases and balance transfers.

Discover will automatically match all the cash back you’ve earned at the end of your first year
No minimum cash-back redemption

Our Expert Take
Intro APR Offer: Get a 0% introductory APR for 15 billing cycles on purchases and for any balance transfers made in the first 60 days of account opening, followed by an 18.24% to 28.24% variable APR. A 3% fee applies to balance transfers made in the first 60 days, then 4%.
The Bank of America® Unlimited Cash Rewards credit card is a strong enough card that you’ll want to keep it around even after your introductory APR offer ends. A combination of unlimited flat-rate cash rewards and no annual fee make this a convenient package for your finances. But of course, the low intro APR for new cardholders is likely what will draw you in. It extends to both new purchases and balance transfers and gives you plenty of breathing room to pay down your debt.

Best 0% APR Credit Cards Methodology

Reasons To Get a 0% APR Credit Card
Before you apply for a card with an introductory 0% APR offer, it’s important to understand both the advantages and disadvantages of using one of these intro offers. Here’s what to keep in mind.
Pros of 0% APR Credit Cards
Cons of 0% APR Credit Cards
Save on interest. If you’d otherwise carry a balance, the APR savings can be substantial.
Offers may be revoked. Missing a payment due date or paying less than the minimum required could mean your interest reverts to the standard APR as a penalty.
Pay down debt faster. Since your entire monthly payment is dedicated to principal payments, you’ll make a bigger dent in your total debt.
Interest-savings strategy may backfire. If you’re the type of person to be tempted to overspend on a 0% card, it could end up costing you a lot of interest once the standard APR resumes.

When Should I Use a 0% Intro APR Credit Card?
It may be appropriate to use a 0% APR credit card if:
You’re making a large purchase and need time to pay it off
You want to consolidate high-interest credit card debt
You need to cover an unexpected emergency expense
You’re motivated and able to pay your balance in full before the introductory period expires
On the other hand, it’s best avoided if using a zero-interest credit card will simply postpone your problems. You need to make a budget to pay off your balance in full before the introductory period ends or else you’ll end up right where you started—except with a potentially higher balance or lowered credit score.
How Does 0% APR Work?
Introductory 0% APR offers allow new cardholders to finance purchases or balance transfers—or sometimes both—without paying interest for a set period. After this time, the regular ongoing interest rate applies to any outstanding balances.
For example, if you made charges in January 2025 on a credit card with a 0% APR on new purchases for 12 months, you would not pay interest charges until January 2026. This gives you an entire year to pay off those charges in smaller chunks.
How Much Could You Save With a 0% Intro APR Offer?
Your potential savings will depend on several factors:
The dollar amount of your total new purchases and/or transferred balance
Length of your promotion
Whether you pay off all the debt before the promotion ends
Potential card fees, such as a balance transfer fee
To give you an idea of how much you can save, let’s say you want to make a $5,000 purchase and can pay it off in 15 months. If you have a current credit card with a 20% APR, you’d pay $689 in interest over 15 months.
But, if you made those charges on a 0% APR credit card with a 15-month promotional period, you’d pay no interest, saving you nearly $700, if you paid off the entire balance within the promotional period.
It’s important to note that saving $700 in this scenario would mean you charged or transferred the $5,000 in the first month of the 15-month intro APR offer. And if you’re transferring a balance, remember that it will likely be subject to a 3% to 5% balance transfer fee added to your total. You can calculate your precise savings by entering your anticipated charges and standard interest rate in our credit card payoff calculator.
Pro Tip
Use a balance transfer calculator to help you determine whether it’s worth it to move a current credit card balance over to a 0% APR card. Input the required details for your current and new credit cards to calculate the potential savings.
How To Pick a 0% APR or Zero-Interest Credit Card
Determine if you need a 0% APR on new purchases, balance transfers or both. Not all cards provide both versions of zero interest, making it important to narrow down which cards are relevant to your needs.
Estimate how much time you need at zero interest. While longer offers give you more time to pay off all or most of your debt without any interest, cards with shorter promotional periods may offer a wider selection of rewards or benefits that make them better options for long-term use.
Calculate your fees and other out-of-pocket costs. Balance transfer cards often charge a transfer fee of 3% to 5% of the amount being transferred, and some cards may also have annual fees or other mandatory charges. If you expect to carry a balance after the introductory period, the standard ongoing APR can also be a major factor.
Look at the total package. Other features like rewards programs, purchase protections and specialty perks can make some cards more appealing than others.

If you’re using a 0% intro APR card for a balance transfer, check for deadlines on when you need to initiate the transfer. Although you might receive 12 to 24 months of 0% financing, you often need to transfer the balance within the first few months of opening the card. Opening a card and missing the deadline would be a missed opportunity.

If you’re considering moving a balance to a 0% intro APR card, calculate what you’ll pay for the balance transfer fee. The fee could be higher than what you might pay for a loan or other low-interest debt repayment option.

It’s crucial when taking advantage of a 0% intro APR offer that you calculate how much your payments will have to be every month to completely knock out the debt during the zero-interest period. Otherwise, if you’re left with lingering debt after the promo period, you could start the clock again and accrue high finance charges.

How To Make the Most of Your 0% Interest Credit Card
Whether you use a 0% APR credit card for a large purchase, emergency expenses or a balance transfer, here are some tips to help you maximize your savings:
Read the fine print. Most 0% APR terms have specific callouts for inflexible timelines and deadlines.
Create a payment plan. Zero-interest offers are temporary, and high-interest charges kick in as soon as the offer expires.
Set up automatic payments. Since missing a payment can lead to forfeiting your 0% offer, set up autopay on your account for at least the minimum amount due.
Take steps to improve your financial management. Limiting your spending, saving in advance for anticipated expenses and building an emergency fund can all help you avoid the need to pay a balance over time in the first place.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
What is a variable APR?
Variable APRs fluctuate with the prime rate. As the prime rate changes, so will the credit card’s APR. An introductory APR is likely to stay the same during the offer period, but will typically revert to a variable APR after the promotion.
How do you qualify for a 0% intro APR offer?
The best 0% APR credit cards usually require good or better credit to qualify (a score starting at 670 or above in the FICO scoring model), as it’s quite risky for an issuer to lend you money for a period of 12 or more months without collecting profit (interest) in the meantime. If your credit isn’t where it needs to be yet, take a few months to improve your credit before applying for new cards.
Consistently making on-time payments, keeping your credit utilization low and not applying for too many new lines of credit in a short period are all actions that can help boost your credit score.
If you’re looking for a card with a permanently low APR, you might want to check with credit unions—some offer lower interest rates than larger corporate banks.
What is the longest 0% intro period I can get on a credit card?
Each card sets its own duration for introductory APR periods, though it’s common to see timelines of 12 or more months. Some of the best offers extend to around two years before interest begins to accrue. See our lists of the longest 0% intro APR credit cards for purchases and longest 0% intro APR credit cards for balance transfers for the lengthiest current offers.
What happens when a 0% APR intro period ends?
After a 0% introductory APR period ends, any new or remaining balance will be charged interest based on the card’s ongoing standard APR. To avoid these costs, you’ll want to pay your balance in full before the introductory period ends.
How does your credit score affect interest rates?
Credit cards often advertise a range of interest rates for a specific card, with your exact rate being determined by your creditworthiness. Someone with a high credit score may receive a lower rate than someone with poor credit, similar to how rates are offered on auto loans and mortgages. However, on 0% APR credit cards, anyone who is approved for the card and offer will pay no interest on eligible balances during the promotional period.
