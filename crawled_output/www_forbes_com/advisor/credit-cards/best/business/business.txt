Business credit cards can play a key role in your company’s growth, as long as you find one that suits you. To make things easier, we’ve highlighted the top 10 business credit cards from our database of dozens based on an analysis of rewards potential, annual fees, APRs, card benefits and built-in business tools or integrations. While each is valuable in its own right, individual cards stand out for specific business scenarios, helping you narrow things down even more.

Our Expert Take
The Sapphire Reserve for Business℠ is a brand new card—and it’s already turning heads. The card is packed with benefits and credits that seamlessly blend travel incentives with what you need for your small business. On the travel side, you can easily take advantage of an annual $300 flexible travel credit, up to $500 in credits toward luxury hotel bookings made through Chase Travel’s The Edit℠ collection and airport lounge access. You can also earn credits for qualifying purchases made with ZipRecruiter, Google Workspace, DoorDash, Lyft and Giftcards.com after activation.
Pros & Cons
8X points on Chase Travel℠ purchases and 4X on direct flights and hotels
Lounge access for the cardholder plus two guests per visit.
Over $1,500 of potential value in statement credits
Valuable redemptions, including Points Boost offers
Superb travel protections
Free employee cards
$795 annual fee is extremely high
Some direct travel reservations earn just 1X
No upgrade option for employee cards to receive additional benefits

High cash-back rates, a welcome bonus, no annual fee and an introductory APR make the U.S. Bank Triple Cash Rewards Visa® Business Card a unicorn. With free employee cards and a $100 annual software subscription credit, it could be worth holding onto well after the intro APR period expires. However, there’s a foreign transaction fee, so this card won’t be a good option for businesses whose employees regularly make purchases while traveling abroad.
Pros & Cons

Methodology for the Best Business Credit Cards
To create a list of the top 10 small business cards, Forbes Advisor analyzed over 60 business credit cards. For each card, we gathered information that potential cardholders would use in their decision-making process, including:
Annual fees
Reward earning rates and values
Welcome bonuses
Interest rates and/or promotions
Card benefits, credits and perks
Consumer protections
Once this information was gathered, we evaluated each card’s characteristics against other, similar cards, meaning we compared hotel cards to hotel cards, cash-back cards to cash-back cards, and the like. We then ranked cards within these subcategories based on potential value and features and chose the best of each card type to feature on this list.
Forbes Advisor re-evaluates each credit card list at least every 12 months to determine if any cards need to be added and/or removed. However, a list could be updated sooner if significant changes are made to the mentioned cards or if a new credit card is announced that’s likely to impact the category.
To learn more about our rating and review methodology and editorial process, check out our guide on how Forbes Advisor rates credit cards.

Why should you get a business credit card?

A business credit card is good if you have longer-term plans to access funding for your business and want to establish business credit. Having evidence of an established business with a solid credit history will help you qualify for lines of credit and other loans in the future. It’s also a good way to keep business transactions separate from your personal ones and can make your accounting/reconciliation process much smoother during tax time.

Business credit cards are crucial to making sure personal and business expenses stay separate and don’t get muddled. It makes organizing finances so much cleaner, and with the right card, I can earn something back for all those business expenses.

How To Compare Business Credit Cards in 2025
With so many different card options in 2025, picking the best business credit cards can be a lengthy process. Prospective cardholders should consider multiple factors before settling on the best match.
Annual Fee
Annual fees often cover membership benefits offered by cards. Potential cardholders should calculate how much they’ll need to spend in order to accumulate enough rewards or cash back to offset that fee. There are many business cards with no annual fee that can be excellent options if you prefer to avoid those costs.
Earnings Structure
Some cards have high earning rates but disappoint when it’s time to redeem. Be diligent in evaluating the redemption value of each card’s rewards.
Intro APR
Some cards will offer not only a welcome bonus but also an intro APR. Consider the amount of time the low interest rate applies, and make sure you have a plan to pay off any large purchases before the intro APR expires and the card’s regular interest rate applies. The best 0% APR business cards may provide 12 months or more to pay off new purchases without interest.
Ongoing APR
If your business needs to carry a balance, looking for a card with low interest rates or interest-free promotional periods can save money. Always remember that APRs are determined based on your creditworthiness, so the lowest interest rate presented in the terms and conditions might not be what you’re granted upon approval.
Financing Options
Is the card a charge card or a credit card? A charge card must be paid in full monthly, while a credit card will allow you to carry a balance with interest. Make sure you know which type of card you’re applying for and that it fits your needs.
What Are the Types of Business Credit Cards?
The two most common credit cards for companies are small business cards and corporate cards. The recommendations on our list include small business cards, which don’t require a custom financial arrangement for application.
Small Business Credit Cards
Small business cards are designed for business owners, including sole proprietors, partnerships and start-ups. Benefits usually cater to smaller businesses and may include intro APR periods or free employee cards. This type of business credit card may be easier to qualify for but can also have more limited lines of credit.
Corporate Credit Cards
Corporate credit cards are typically offered to larger or more established businesses with significant annual expenses. They may include corporate expense tracking systems. There are many types of fee structures, reward options and perks.

How To Build Business Credit
Building business credit works in the same way as building personal credit—by using it and paying off the bill on time and in full each month. However, businesses can also do a few other things to help establish credit.
Register your business and obtain an employer identification number from the IRS.
Obtain a D-U-N-S Number, which can be obtained from Dun & Bradstreet, a business credit reporting agency.
Open a business credit card.
Use the credit card responsibly by paying your bills on time and not overextending yourself.

Alternatives to Business Credit Cards
It can be tempting to simply use a card you already have for business expenses, but there are worthwhile reasons to specifically consider a business card over a personal card. Alternatively, you may wish to use a different form of financing, such as:
Small business loans
Business line of credit
Invoice financing
Crowdfunding
Are Business Credit Cards Worth It?
Business credit cards allow small business owners, start-ups and corporate managers alike to track finances separately and gain access to revolving capital. Regardless of how small or established your business is, it can also help you:
Manage your expenses. Many business cards offer reporting tools, easy exports to accounting software and the ability to set limits on employee cards.
Build a business credit history. Your payment history and other activity are reported and can help improve your business credit score to better qualify for future financing.
Unlock exclusive rewards. Card benefits and reward programs can lead to significant value for your business.
Pro Tip
It’s important to understand how a business credit card can affect your personal credit. Most business cards require a personal guarantee to cover debt with personal assets if your business can’t pay. Additionally, delinquencies and other negative card behavior might be added to your personal credit reports.

FAQs for Business Credit Cards
How do business credit cards work?
Business credit cards operate like personal credit cards, but they can help build your business credit because they typically report to commercial credit bureaus.
What is the easiest business credit card to get?
A secured business credit card will likely be among the easiest cards to receive approval for since lines of credit with secured cards are collateralized. Though these cards do require business owners and operators to secure the line of credit with a deposit, they can offer pathways for businesses to build credit.
How many business credit cards should I have?
Each business may have a different ideal number of business credit cards. Carrying multiple business cards may allow you to earn more varied and higher rewards and provide a more comprehensive set of business benefits, but managing multiple accounts requires more time and oversight.
What business credit card gives the highest limit?
Business credit card issuers don’t publicly disclose their credit limits. However, if you have a well-established business with high expenses, you may consider a card with no preset spending limit.
Potential options include The Business Platinum Card® from American Express* and the Capital One Spark Cash Plus (rates & fees).
