Editorial Note: We earn a commission from partner links on Forbes Advisor. Commissions do not affect our editors' opinions or evaluations.
Building credit from scratch can feel daunting, but picking the right first credit card can help jump-start the journey.
To find the best credit cards for beginners, we narrowed our database of 400-plus credit cards to those that are available to students and people with fair, limited or no credit history, leaving us with 83 options. From there, we analyzed fees and rewards data to identify the top cards in three categories—student cards, secured cards and no-deposit cards. Further, we leveraged our proprietary Consumer Sentiment Index to see what real users appreciate most about each card and potential pain points to consider before applying.
Why you can trust Forbes Advisor
Our credit card editors are committed to bringing you unbiased ratings and information. Advertisers do not and cannot influence our ratings. We use data-driven methodologies to evaluate financial products and companies, so all are measured equally. You can read more about our editorial guidelines and the credit card methodology for the ratings below.

Our Expert Take
The headline feature of the Discover it® Student Cash Back is its excellent 5% cash back on everyday purchases at different places each quarter like grocery stores, restaurants, gas stations and more, up to the quarterly maximum once activated. Plus, earn unlimited 1% cash back on all other purchases. It’s also one of the rare student cards to offer a welcome bonus, and it’s a unique one. New cardholders can receive an Unlimited Cashback Match™ – Discover will match all the cash back you’ve earned at the end of your first year. There’s no minimum spending or maximum rewards. You’ll also get a 0% intro APR on purchases for 6 months, then the standard variable purchase APR of 17.24% to 26.24% applies. While the intro APR period is modest, it gives students some time to learn the ropes of managing their credit payments before the regular APR kicks in.
Expert Commentary
Albert Hsieh
Credit Cards and Reward Points Expert
Albert Hsieh is founder and CEO of Foxtrot Dash Inc., a San Francisco-based travel rewards marketplace offering a smart wallet that recommends 30,000 ways to maximize the redemption of hard-earned credit card and travel rewards points. He has proudly redeemed over 30 million reward points, and he and the Foxtrot Dash team boast over three decades of points and miles experience.
Albert has had a lifelong passion for aviation largely sparked by his dad, who retired after 30 years with United Airlines at San Francisco and Oakland. Since childhood, Albert grew fascinated by premium air travel and flew “The Tulip” (the nickname for United's fondly remembered "U" logo) to destinations far and near, with Taiwan, Japan and Egypt ranked as his top favorites.
With an unwavering commitment to the global travel industry, Albert served for 20 years as a commercial and marketing leader at Fortune 500 travel companies including JetBlue, China Airlines, XOJET and Westfield Airports LAX. He later worked as a consultant for Jet Edge, leading a companywide rebrand before their VistaJet acquisition. In recent years, Albert launched his Instagram feed where he captures his global credit card points and airline miles adventures with impeccable photography of luxury airline cabins and beautiful hotels.
His work is regularly featured in social campaigns, and he has drawn mentions in The New York Times and Nob Hill Gazette. On the Money Seed podcast, he has been heard discussing the future of credit card reward points, global travel trends and loyalty programs. When he's not traveling, Albert enjoys life on the West Coast by seeking out new restaurants and world-class wineries, and by spending quality time with loved ones.

Our Expert Take
You’ll get grownup-sized rewards even while you’re in college with the Bank of America® Customized Cash Rewards credit card for Students. Cardholders can choose a single category out of a select list to earn an additional 3% cash back (from options like gas and EV charging, online shopping, dining or travel) on top of other everyday rewards. You can earn an even higher reward rate in your first year. You’ll need to keep an eye on your spending, though—the 3% and 2% cash back is limited to the first $2,500 in combined purchases each quarter. After that, those categories earn an unlimited 1% like all other purchases.

Best First Credit Cards Methodology
Forbes Advisor analyzed dozens of cards aimed at credit newcomers and those just starting out with their first credit card to help you determine which might be a good fit for your needs. This list comprises the top unsecured cards, secured cards and student cards for those looking for their first credit card.
Cards on this list are graded against various factors, which vary depending on the card category (unsecured, secured, student). The factors considered include:
Rewards: 20% to 50%
APR and fees: 35% to 50%
Accessibility and eligibility: 10% to 45%
We focused primarily on cards that offer opportunities to build credit by reporting to the major credit bureaus. Some cards are best for those with fair to average credit, while others target those with bad credit or no credit history.
The Consumer Sentiment Index from Forbes Advisor uses a proprietary weighting system designed by our subject matter experts. It evaluates thousands of consumer insights and reviews from leading online forums to determine customer satisfaction at scale.
Forbes Advisor reevaluates each credit card list at least every 12 months to determine if any cards need to be added and/or removed. However, a list could be updated sooner if significant changes are made to the mentioned cards or if a new credit card is announced that’s likely to impact the category.
To learn more about our rating and review methodology and editorial process, check out our guide on how Forbes Advisor rates credit cards.
Which Type of Starter Credit Card Should You Choose?
Situation
Recommended Card Type
Reason
You’re enrolled in college.
Student card
Oftentimes, card issuers offer the same benefits and fees on student cards as their nonstudent counterparts. If you’re a college student, a student card will almost always be your top choice for a first credit card.
You’re not enrolled in college, and you have no credit history.
Secured card
If you don’t have any credit history yet, you may struggle to get approved for many traditional credit cards. But you can boost your approval odds by providing a security deposit.
You’re not enrolled in college, and you either have some credit history or can improve your approval odds in other ways.
No-deposit card (unsecured card)
These may be your best choice if you’ve built a limited credit history, such as from being an authorized user or making student loan payments.
Some cards with no deposit requirements offer nontraditional ways to improve your chances of approval. For example, you’ll have a better chance of qualifying for the Chase Freedom Rise® if you have a Chase checking or savings account.
See More See Less
Don’t underestimate a secured credit card. They have the same power to build credit, and most issuers will return your deposit once you demonstrate consistent payments. Long term, it’s a much better option than a starter card with an annual fee.
— Jenn Underwood, Credit Cards Expert
What To Look for in Beginner Credit Cards
For All Beginner Cards
No annual fee. Look for cards that don’t charge annual fees (or at least have the potential to upgrade to a no-annual-fee version). This allows you to keep the card account open to preserve its credit history without paying a price for the privilege.
Three-bureau credit reporting. For responsible payment behavior to improve your credit score, it must be added to your credit reports. This is why it’s essential to make sure whatever starter card you apply for reports to all three main credit bureaus: Experian, Equifax and TransUnion.
Rewards. Rewards shouldn’t be the main focus during your search for a first credit card, since you’ll likely start with a lower credit line that will limit your rewards potential. Still, earning some rewards can provide icing on the cake while you build credit.
For Secured Cards
Upgrade path. Many of the best secured cards offer the opportunity to get your deposit back and upgrade to an unsecured version without requiring you to close your account.
Affordable deposit. Both secured cards on this list require a minimum deposit of $200. If that amount would stretch your budget, you may want to consider a card without a minimum deposit, such as the Chime Visa® Credit Card or the Varo Believe Credit-Builder Card.
For No-Deposit (Unsecured) Cards
Lenient credit requirements. Since you won’t get an approval boost due to your college enrollment status or a security deposit, it’s essential to look for cards that clearly state they will consider those with new, limited or fair credit histories.
Preapproval tools. With these tools, you can see if you qualify for a card without impacting your credit. If you’re not preapproved, you can simply move on to another card—no harm, no foul. But if you do receive preapproval, you can more confidently submit your application, which typically involves a hard credit check.
How To Make the Most of a Starter Card
A beginner card can be a stepping stone to building better credit and gaining access to more lucrative credit cards. But using credit cards also involves the risk of going into debt. Here’s how to maximize the potential benefits of your first credit card while minimizing the dangers.
1. Always Make On-Time Payments
Not only is this the most important factor for building credit, but it also helps you avoid late payment fees. To protect against accidentally missing a payment due date, consider setting up autopay in your online account.
2. Avoid Using Too Much of Your Credit Limit
Credit utilization, the percentage of your total revolving credit you use, is the second most influential FICO scoring factor. With all things being equal, a lower credit utilization can improve your credit score. Using some of your credit is fine, but experts recommend keeping your utilization below 30% when possible.
3. Aim To Pay Off Your Statement Balance Each Month
While making the minimum payment is all that’s required to keep your credit card account in good standing, you’ll accrue interest if you don’t pay off your entire statement balance. And since credit cards are known for having high APRs, those interest charges can add up quickly. By paying back your full statement balance each billing cycle, you can build credit without putting your financial health in jeopardy.
Pro Tip
Myth-buster: One of the most persistent credit myths is that carrying a balance from month to month helps your credit score. In reality, paying off your statement balance not only helps you avoid interest charges but also ensures your utilization remains low. That’s a win-win for both your wallet and credit health.

While it is a secured card requiring a deposit, I like the Bank of America® Customized Cash Rewards Secured Credit Card* because it can earn a solid 3% cash back in a category of choice, ranging from groceries to online shopping and home improvement stores while helping build credit.
Kelly-Ann Franklin
Credit Cards Editor
I often recommend the Chase Freedom Rise® to people looking for a first credit card. It has a straightforward reward structure and no annual fee. Plus, with responsible credit behavior, cardholders can earn an upgrade to the even more rewarding Chase Freedom Unlimited®. However, the Freedom Rise isn’t a fit for international travelers since it charges a foreign transaction fee.

Other Beginner Credit Cards To Consider
While we think the cards above are the best options for most people, you may be better off with a different card if one of the following situations applies.
You’re an International Student
Since most credit card applications require a Social Security number, it can be difficult for foreign students without one to start building their U.S. credit. However, the is specifically designed for international students and immigrants and doesn’t require a credit check or SSN to apply.
You’re Under Age 21
The CARD Act of 2009 prohibits issuers from approving credit card applications from those younger than 21 unless they can either prove they have independent income or a co-signer. Due to these restrictions, the most accessible way to get your first credit card before you turn 21 will likely be for a trusted family member or friend to add you as an authorized user to their account.
Is a Beginner Credit Card Worth It?
The right beginner credit card can serve as a valuable tool in your credit-building journey. Regardless of your chosen card type, keeping your utilization low and paying your bills on time will set you up for success. By using your first card wisely, you can improve your credit score while opening the door to more rewarding financial opportunities in the future.
The secured Chime Visa® Credit Card is issued by The Bancorp Bank, N.A. or Stride Bank, N.A. pursuant to a license from Visa U.S.A. Inc. and may be used everywhere Visa credit cards are accepted. Please see the back of your Card for its issuing bank.
First Credit Card FAQs
Why is it important to establish credit?
Using a credit card responsibly is one of the best ways to build a positive credit history and boost your credit score. The higher your credit score, the more you can save on various products and services, including credit cards, lines of credit, car loans and mortgages.
Do store cards make good beginner credit cards?
A store card can help you build credit, but this type of card often has higher interest rates than general-use credit cards. The Amazon Prime Secured Card* could be worth considering for those who often shop at Amazon.com. It earns 2% back at Amazon.com, Amazon Fresh and more for eligible Prime members, non members do not currently earn rewards with this card. It also has a lower-than-average 10.00% fixed rate APR on purchases.
What’s the difference between a beginner card and a bad credit card?
While a beginner credit card is designed for people new to credit, a bad credit card is tailored to those with damaged credit scores looking to rebuild. Bad credit cards, or cards for those with bad credit (580 or below in the FICO scoring model), tend to have less favorable terms and rewards than starter credit cards. While both types of cards can help you build credit, a beginner card should be your preferred choice if you don’t have a negative credit history that could stand in the way of your approval.
How can I monitor my credit score progress?
There’s a good chance that your credit card issuer may allow you to track your credit score from your online account. If not, there are several online credit monitoring services to choose from.
Is it bad to apply for multiple starter credit cards on the same day?
If each application adds a hard inquiry to your credit reports, applying for multiple credit cards at the same time can have a negative impact on your credit score. However, many cards on our list have preapproval tools that use soft inquiries, so you can check with as many of these as you’d like without impacting your credit scores.
