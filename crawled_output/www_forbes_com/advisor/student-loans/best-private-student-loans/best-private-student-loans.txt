Paying for college can be stressful and requires considerable financial planning. After using savings, scholarships and grants to pay for tuition and fees, you may still need more funds to cover college expenses. Student loans may be your next best option.We compared 16 national lenders to find the best private student loan available. Interest rates, forbearance options and loan fees were the main factors when considering each lender. We also considered the application process, loan terms, credit score disclosures, income requirements, borrower perks like autopay discounts and customer service when creating our list.

Editor’s Take
Ascent stands out for offering multiple payment terms and serving a diverse audience, including international students who apply with an eligible co-signer. Six loan term options are available, so you can design a loan payoff timeline that best fits your budget.
Why We Like It
We love that Ascent offers several repayment plans, including the progressive repayment option, which starts with a lower payment that gradually increases.
Undergraduate and graduate borrowers also get a nine-month grace period before payments begin, and dental and medical graduates get a 12-month grace period.
What We Don’t Like
Interest rates are high for borrowers who don’t apply with a co-signer.
Who It’s Best For
Ascent student loans are best for borrowers with co-signers looking for flexible repayment terms and longer payment grace periods than competing products.
Pros & Cons
Payment grace periods of nine to 36 months
Forbearance available for up to 24 months
Co-signer release available after 12 months
Loans without a co-signer may have significantly higher rates
Unclear minimum credit requirements
5% origination fee for career training loans

Editor’s Take
Earnest offers some of the lowest interest rates on the loan market for students applying with a creditworthy co-signer. Plus, Earnest serves many types of borrowers, including international, DACA and graduate students.
Why We Like It
We like that interest rates for co-signed student loans start at just 2.89% APR, and Earnest promises to match your rate if you get a better rate with another lender.
Borrowers also get a nine-month grace period before loan payments are due compared to the typical six-month grace period offered by most other private and federal loans.
What We Don’t Like
Borrowers must have at least three years of credit history to qualify, which is a requirement young adults may not be able to meet fresh out of high school.
Who It’s Best For
Earnest is best for borrowers with good credit or access to a creditworthy co-signer because co-signed loans offer the lowest interest rates.
Pros & Cons
Provides rate match guarantee
Forbearance available for up to 12 months
No fees, including no late fees
Co-signer release not available
At least fair credit necessary to qualify
Details
Loan terms
Five, seven, 10, 12 or 15 years
Loan amounts
$1,000 up to the total cost of attendance with a $400,000 lifetime limit
Forbearance options
Up to 12 months of forbearance may be available.
Co-signer release policy
Co-signer release isn’t available. You have to refinance the loan to remove a co-signer.
Disclosures
¹You can take advantage of the Auto Pay interest rate reduction by setting up and maintaining active and automatic ACH withdrawal of your loan payment from a checking or savings account. The interest rate reduction for Auto Pay will be available only while your loan is enrolled in Auto Pay. Interest rate incentives for utilizing Auto Pay may not be combined with certain private student loan repayment programs that also offer an interest rate reduction. For multi-party loans, only one party may enroll in Auto Pay. It is important to note that the 0.25% Auto Pay discount is not available while loan payments are deferred.
²Earnest clients may skip one payment every 12 months. Your first request to skip a payment can be made once you’ve made at least 6 months of consecutive on-time payments, and your loan is in good standing. The interest accrued during the skipped month will result in an increase in your remaining minimum payment. The final payoff date on your loan will be extended by the length of the skipped payment periods. Please be aware that a skipped payment does count toward the forbearance limits. Please note that skipping a payment is not guaranteed and is at Earnest’s discretion. Your monthly payment and total loan cost may increase as a result of postponing your payment and extending your term.
³Nine-month grace period is not available for borrowers who choose our Principal and Interest Repayment plan while in school.

Editor’s Take
With a speedy prequalification and application process, Education Loan Finance (ELFI) is our top pick for borrowers who want a fast application process. ELFI borrowers can also access student loan advisors who can answer questions about education financing.
Why We Like It
In addition to competitive rates, we like that ELFI offers loan forbearance of up to 12 months if borrowers face financial difficulty.
What We Don’t Like
When applying without a co-signer, you need at least three years of credit history for loan approval with ELFI, which could be a major barrier for recent high school graduates and young adults.
Who It’s Best For
ELFI loans are best for undergraduate, graduate and parent borrowers who value a quick application process and have a credit score of at least 680 or a creditworthy co-signer.
Pros & Cons
Transparent eligibility requirements
Forbearance available for up to 12 months
One-on-one support from student loan advisors
No co-signer release without refinancing
Strong credit is necessary to qualify
Details
Loan terms

SoFi stands out from the pack by providing exclusive member benefits, such as family rate discounts, rewards opportunities and access to financial advice from certified advisors.
Why We Like It
We love that SoFi charges no fees, including no late, insufficient funds, origination or prepayment penalty fees. Borrowers can also lock in savings by securing the 0.25% autopay discount. Plus, if the applicant or co-signer is a current SoFi customer, new student loans qualify for another 0.125% rate discount.
What We Don’t Like
SoFi offers co-signer release, but you must make 24 on-time loan payments before applying.
Who It’s Best For
SoFi student loans are best for borrowers who value customer experience and extra perks. On top of rate discounts, members get extra bells and whistles like expedited access to SoFi stadium, invitations to social events and referral bonuses.

What We Don’t Like
College Ave charges late fees, and interest rates may be high if you don’t have strong credit.
Who It’s Best For
College Ave is best for borrowers shopping for education financing to cover many years of school. Law, MBA and medical school students who’ve exhausted federal loan options should also consider what College Ave offers.

Editor’s Take
Rhode Island Student Loan Authority (RISLA) provides less flexible loans than other lenders, with only 10- and 15-year terms available. However, rate caps are low, making it an option worth considering if those two terms fit your goals.
Why We Like It
Along with low rates, RISLA offers rewards of up to $2,000 in loan forgiveness for interns, and nurses may be eligible for four years of no interest. When facing hardship, RISLA borrowers may qualify for income-based repayment plans or up to 24 months of forbearance.
What We Don’t Like
RISLA loans don’t offer much in terms of customizability since there are only two loan term options. Further, the maximum you can borrow is $50,000 per year, which may not be enough for those pursuing advanced degrees.
Who It’s Best For
RISLA is best for borrowers looking for a traditional 10-year term loan and have sufficient personal income or a creditworthy co-signer to land low APRs.
Pros & Cons
Low interest rates compared to competitors
Co-signer release available after 24 consecutive months of on-time payments

Borrowers can choose from low-payment options, including deferment while in school or interest-only payments for 12 months once the post-graduation grace period ends. Borrowers who fall behind on payments may also be eligible for loan modifications, payment extensions or reduced payments to get back on track.
What We Don’t Like
Sallie Mae currently offers no way to check interest rates without a hard inquiry, which temporarily dings your credit score.
Who It’s Best For
Sallie Mae student loans are best for borrowers who could benefit from low payments while job hunting and career climbing after graduation.

Editor’s Take
Nelnet Bank is backed by the loan servicer Nelnet and offers private student loans and parent loans for borrowers who meet credit requirements.
Why We Like It
Sometimes, loan eligibility conditions can be vague, and we like that Nelnet clearly defines its credit requirements if you don’t have a co-signer. You need a minimum credit score in the mid-to-high 600s to be eligible without a co-signer.
What We Don’t Like
Netlnet Bank’s website mentions payment assistance may be available but doesn’t explain the options. Borrowers struggling with payments must contact the lender to discuss arrangements.
Who It’s Best For
Nelnet Bank is best for borrowers applying without a co-signer who can show proof of stable income and decent credit. However, you might need to look elsewhere if you want a range of repayment options like income-based repayment.
Pros & Cons

Editor’s Take
Citizens Bank is our top pick for rate discounts since student loans come with combinable discount opportunities that can drive down your monthly payments and long-term costs.
Why We Like It
Citizens Bank offers a discount of 0.25% for using autopay, which is pretty common across student loan lenders. However, you can get another 0.25% discount (for a total of 0.50%) if you or your co-signer has an eligible Citizens Bank account open at the time of application.
What We Don’t Like
Citizens Bank requires 36 months of on-time payments for co-signer release and charges late fees if you make late payments.
Who It’s Best For
Citizens Bank student loans are best for existing customers or applicants willing to open a bank account before applying to receive the maximum rate discount.

Current Average Student Loan Interest Rates
Private student loan lenders typically set interest rates using a benchmark like the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR). The SOFR tends to align with the federal funds rate set by the Federal Reserve.
Below are average rates for 10-year fixed-rate loans and 5-year variable-rate loans.
Note that several factors determine your rate, including income and credit history. Typically, you’ll receive a lower rate with a higher credit score and sufficient income.
Student Loan Interest Rate Trends
Most private student loans are heavily credit-based. That means a lender will determine your interest rate based on the strength of your (or your co-signer’s) credit.
However, other factors may be considered for approval as well, such as your school and degree program. In some cases, lenders even offer non-credit-based loans that put a greater focus on your GPA and other education factors if you have limited credit.
Below are current interest rate trends for five-year and 10-year loans.
How Do Student Loans Work?
Student loans can be used to pay for many school-related expenses, including tuition, room and board, books and school supplies, transportation and other common expenses.
Once your loan application is approved, the funds are disbursed to the school to cover your balance. You can often defer repayment until after leaving school, but interest may start accruing immediately.

What must borrowers consider when choosing between federal and private student loans?
Renée Earwood
Student Loans Expert, Federal Student Loan Debt Repayment Options Expert
Ryan Galliotto
Student Loans Expert
When choosing between federal and private student loans, borrowers should consider their financial situation and goals after graduation. Creating a mock budget that includes anticipated starting salary, monthly living expenses, future financial goals and student loan repayment terms can help the borrower decide which lloan is best for them.
For example, borrowers who plan on entering professions or working for employers who qualify for a federal student loan forgiveness program may want to run a repayment analysis of the corresponding forgiveness program they may be eligible for and compare that to the terms of a private loan with regard to monthly repayment amount and total cost.
If a borrower isn’t sure whether they can afford their student loan payment after graduation, federal student loans tend to offer more flexible repayment plans based on income along with deferment and forbearance options. If a borrower doesn’t anticipate utilizing any of the federal student loan options and benefits and can find a lower interest rate with a private lender, then choosing a private student loan could be the best option for saving on the total cost of repayment.
Renée Earwood
Student Loans Expert, Federal Student Loan Debt Repayment Options Expert
Federal loans typically come with more “bells and whistles” than private loans, making them the more attractive option. These bells and whistles include better repayment options, forgiveness opportunities and easier approval odds, as a credit check isn’t necessary for most federal loans (aside from PLUS loans).
If a borrower is worried that they may not be able to keep up with their payments after graduation, federal loans make sense since they’ll have access to better repayment options than private loans offer. Also, if they think they’ll work in the nonprofit space for at least 10 years, they can potentially have their federal loans forgiven via the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program.
It should also be noted that any borrower, regardless of where they work, who has federal loans being paid back on income-driven repayment plans can have their remaining balances forgiven after 20-25 years, depending on which plan they are on.
For these reasons, I typically recommend that borrowers max out their federal loan amounts first, then, if needed, take out private loans. You can always refinance your federal loans down the road (making them private loans), but you can’t transfer private loans to the federal system.

Pros and Cons of Private Student Loans
Borrowing a private student loan has its advantages, but there are also potential downsides. Consider these pros and cons before you apply.
Pros
Fills in the gaps when you’ve maxed out financial aid. You can use private student loans to pay for tuition, fees, supplies, groceries, rent or other costs.
May be able to borrow up to your school’s full cost of attendance. By contrast, some federal student loans come with borrowing limits.
Low interest rates may be available for excellent credit. Creditworthy applicants may access low fixed and variable interest rates.
Provides funding for international students. International students aren’t eligible for federal student loans or financial aid but can qualify for a private student loan.
Cons
May require a co-signer. Most undergraduates have to apply with a co-signer, such as a parent, to get approved for a loan.
Interest rates could be high. Interest rates may exceed 17%, resulting in high borrowing costs.
Not as many protections as federal student loans. Federal student loans are eligible for various benefits, including income-driven repayment, deferment and forbearance. Private student loans may or may not come with these protections.
Don’t qualify for federal loan forgiveness. Private student loans aren’t eligible for federal forgiveness programs, such as Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF), Teacher Loan Forgiveness or the loan forgiveness you can receive at the end of an IDR plan.
How Much Will a Student Loan Cost You Up Front?
Some lenders charge origination fees to process your loan. This is typically a percentage of your loan amount that’s subtracted from what you borrow.
These fees vary widely with private lenders, and some lenders don’t charge them at all.
All federal student loans, on the other hand, charge an origination fee. For loans disbursed before October 1, 2025, the fees are 1.057% for direct subsidized and unsubsidized loans, and 4.228% for parent and graduate PLUS loans.
We asked Andrew Paulson, co-founder of StudentLoanAdvice.com and Forbes Advisor advisory board member, what borrowers should consider about fees when choosing a lender.
When considering private student loans, most lenders don’t charge origination fees. However, certain specialty loans, such as those for medical, dental or MBA programs, may include additional fees. If the private lender you’re working with charges an origination fee, it may be worth exploring other lenders for better options.
– Andrew Paulson, Forbes Advisor advisory board member
Other Student Loan Fees To Consider
Once you begin repaying your student loans, you may run into other costs, such as a late payment fee if you don’t make on-time payments.
On a positive note, student loan lenders and servicers are prohibited by federal law from charging a penalty fee if you make extra payments or if you pay off your student loans early.

Tips for Comparing Private Student Loan Companies
Do your due diligence as you prepare to borrow a private student loan. Experts recommend borrowing no more than what you’ll most likely earn in your first year out of college. This can protect you from having unmanageable monthly payments after you leave school.
When you review each lender and loan, consider the following factors:
Loan Amount
Loan amounts can vary depending on the lender and degree you’re pursuing. Some lenders offer to finance up to 100% of school costs, but using college savings, grants and scholarships can help reduce how much you need to borrow.
Loan Cost
The primary factor that impacts student loan costs is a loan’s annual percentage rate (APR), which varies depending on your credit. Most private student loans don’t have application or origination fees, but it’s worth checking for extra fees to understand the loan’s total cost.
Repayment Term
Loan terms typically range from five to 20 years. Shorter loan terms have higher payments but get you out of debt faster. A longer repayment term might have more manageable payments but will cost more in interest over time.
Borrower Benefits
Lenders might offer different perks to borrowers, such as interest rate discounts for using autopay. In some cases, lenders may also offer deferred payments until after you leave school and pause payments if you face financial hardship.
Co-signer Release
Applying with a co-signer who has good credit is one of the best ways to qualify for a low-rate private student loan. Some lenders also have a co-signer release policy, which allows you to remove your co-signer after meeting conditions. Often, borrowers can apply for co-signer release after making 12 to 48 months’ worth of on-time monthly payments.
Pro Tip
When shopping around for a loan, make sure to review all loan features and not just interest rates. That’s because autopay discounts, good grade rewards, graduation cashback offers and borrower protections could help you save money and offer a safety net if you lose a job or face a reduction in income during repayment.
How To Get a Private Student Loan
Consider private loans if you’ve reached the annual or aggregate limits for federal student loans and need to borrow additional funds.
The private student loan application process can take several weeks or even months, so most lenders recommend applying at least two months before your tuition due date. Here’s how to apply for a private student loan:
1. Review your credit
Private student loan lenders typically review your credit when you apply. You’ll typically need good to excellent credit to qualify for a loan. Before applying for a loan, review your credit reports at AnnualCreditReport.com, where you can access your credit report for free, to ensure all the information on those reports is correct.
2. Consider a co-signer
If you don’t have good credit or a source of income, you may need to apply with a co-signer. Speak with your co-signer about repayment expectations to ensure you’re both on the same page about sharing responsibility for the loan.
3. Gather supporting documents
Save time on your loan application by gathering the necessary documents ahead of time. Generally, lenders will ask for your address, Social Security number (SSN), income, employment information and details about your co-signer (if applicable).
4. Compare lenders
Take some time to compare multiple lenders, including banks, credit unions and online lenders. Eligibility requirements, repayment terms and interest rates vary by lender, so it’s wise to shop around. Some lenders let you check your rates through prequalification and a soft credit check, which won’t impact your credit.
5. Choose an offer and apply
As you compare loan offers, look for a loan with a low interest rate, low (or no) fees and flexible repayment terms. Once you’ve found an offer you want to move forward with, submit a full application. You can usually apply online and may need to provide documentation with your personal information, such as W-2s, tax returns, ID and proof of address.
6. Sign your loan agreement
If you’re approved, your last step is to sign your loan agreement so the funds can be disbursed. Read over the contract details carefully so you understand the rates and terms of your loan, as well as when your first payment is due.
Pro Tip
To get the best student loan interest rate, improve your credit score before applying or use a co-signer with a longer credit history and higher credit score. Many younger student borrowers have shorter credit histories and less diverse credit mixes than older adults, so most private student loans are co-signed.
If you’re a parent planning ahead for college costs and know you’ll be considering student loans, adding your child as an authorized user to a credit card will help improve their credit score. In the end, this can lead to them receiving lower interest rates.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
Can I get a student loan without a co-signer?
It’s possible to get a student loan without a co-signer, but the difficulty of doing so depends on your situation.
Nearly every type of federal student loan does not require (or allow) co-signers. Because you don’t need a high credit score to qualify for these types of loans, most students are eligible without a co-signer if they can meet a few basic requirements.
Private student loans, however, may be harder to get on your own. These types of loans require a high credit score of at least 670 to qualify for the lowest rates. If you can’t qualify individually, you may need to add a co-signer to your application. However, some lenders offer a co-signer release after you meet certain requirements, so look for that feature as you compare your options.
Some private lenders specialize in student loans without a co-signer; instead of reviewing your credit, they may consider things like your performance in school and field of study instead. While it may be easier to qualify for these loans, they typically come with higher interest rates.
How much money can I borrow through private student loans?
The maximum amount you can borrow varies by lender. Some lenders allow you to borrow up to 100% of the school-certified cost of attendance—which considers tuition, fees, textbooks and room and board—while others have caps of $50,000 per year.
How long does it take to get a private student loan?
The amount of time it takes to get a private student loan will vary by lender, but expect it to take one to three weeks to receive your funds. Along with processing your application, the private lender will likely reach out to your school to confirm your cost of attendance. The lender may send your loan funds directly to your financial aid office, which will apply them to tuition and fees before sending the remaining funds over to you.
Do private student loans allow deferment or forbearance?
Some private student loans allow you to defer your loan payments while you are attending school, but interest still accrues on these loans. Some lenders may offer deferment for a financial hardship or during military deployment. Forbearance also lets you suspend payments for a certain period of time.
Regardless of whether payments are suspended payments through deferment or forbearance, the unpaid interest gets added to your principal, causing your monthly payments to increase once repayment begins again.
