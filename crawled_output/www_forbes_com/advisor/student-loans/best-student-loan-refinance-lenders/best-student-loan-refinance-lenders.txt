Refinancing student loan debt can potentially save you money on interest while you’re repaying your education costs. If you’re saddled by higher interest rates, refinancing to a lower rate can free up cash in your budget to spend on other bills or to pay down your student debt even faster.

Editor’s Take
Rhode Island Student Loan Authority, or RISLA, is a Rhode Island-based nonprofit that refinances loans for customers across the country. It stands apart for its income-based repayment program, which limits payments to 15% of income for a 25-year period if borrowers can’t afford their payments. That’s an extremely rare perk in the student loan refinance market, as is its 24-month forbearance period. RISLA did not receive a perfect score because it doesn’t provide a co-signer release policy and it charges late fees.
RISLA only offers fixed interest rates.
Pros & Cons
Charges no origination fees, late fees or insufficient fund fees
Provides income-based repayment plans
Provides up to 24 months in hardship forbearance
Co-signer release is not offered in Colorado, Connecticut, Maine, Nevada and Washington, D.C.
Good credit is necessary to qualify
Lowest rates are only available to Rhode Island residents attending schools in other states or borrowers attending school in Rhode Island
Offers no payment grace period for loans unless you’re currently enrolled in school
Details
Loan terms: 5, 10 and 15 years
Loan amounts available: $1,500 to $45,000 per year ($150,000 aggregate per borrower).
Eligibility:
Applicants must show a minimum income of $40,000 per year and a minimum credit score of 680. Most undergraduate students will need a co-signer to qualify.
Forbearance options:
Forbearance available for up to 24 months.
Co-signer release policy:
Available after 24 months of payments. Periods during which borrowers use income-based repayment do not qualify.

Editor’s Take
SoFi allows borrowers with an associate’s degree to refinance, which opens up eligibility to a wider range of applicants. (We believe the ability to refinance without a bachelor’s degree is an important feature of a refinance loan; seven of the 10 lenders on our list offer it.) Also, it’s one of four lenders on our list that does not place a limit on the amount you can refinance. It’s possible to refinance up to the total balance of your loans, which is helpful for those with a lot of debt from professional degrees.
SoFi’s rates aren’t as low as some other lenders’, and it doesn’t offer co-signer release, which is unusual among our top picks. But as a SoFi customer, you’ll get access to benefits like a 0.125% interest rate discount on certain additional SoFi products, such as personal loans.
Pros & Cons
Provides multiple opportunities to lower your rate
Charges no late fees
At least an associate’s degree is required to refinance loans
Co-signer release isn’t available
Details
Loan terms: 5, 7, 10, 15 and 20 years.
Loan amounts: $5,000 up to total balance of eligible loans.
Eligibility: Must have at least an associate degree and have graduated or been enrolled in a degree-granting eligible school with an income or a job offer that starts within 90 days.
Co-signer release policy: SoFi® doesn’t offer co-signer release for student loan refinancing, but borrowers who qualify to refinance loans without a co-signer can do so.
*Disclosure
*Fixed rates range from 4.99% APR to 9.99% APR with 0.25% autopay discount and 0.125% SoFi Plus discount. Variable rates range from 5.99% APR to 9.99% APR with 0.25% autopay discount and 0.125% SoFi Plus discount. Unless required to be lower to comply with applicable law, Variable Interest rates will never exceed 13.95% (the maximum rate for these loans). SoFi rate ranges are current as of 08/01/25 and are subject to change at any time. Your actual rate will be within the range of rates listed above and will depend on the term you select, evaluation of your creditworthiness, income, presence of a co-signer and a variety of other factors. Lowest rates reserved for the most creditworthy borrowers. For the SoFi variable-rate product, the variable interest rate for a given month is derived by adding a margin to the 30-day average SOFR index, published two business days preceding such calendar month, rounded up to the nearest one hundredth of one percent (0.01% or 0.0001). APRs for variable-rate loans may increase after origination if the SOFR index increases. You may pay more interest over the life of the loan if you refinance with an extended term.
Autopay Discount: The SoFi 0.25% autopay interest rate reduction requires you to agree to make monthly payments as outlined in your loan agreement by an automatic monthly deduction from a savings or checking account. This benefit will discontinue and be lost for periods in which you do not pay by automatic deduction from a savings or checking account. When the autopay interest rate deduction is added or removed, the next time the loan is re-amortized (quarterly for fixed rate loans; monthly for variable rate loans),the principal balance of your loan will be spread over the remaining loan term, and your monthly payment amount will change. This benefit is suspended during periods of deferment, grace period, or forbearance. Autopay is not required to receive a loan from SoFi.
SoFi Plus Discount: To be eligible to receive an additional (0.125%) interest rate reduction on your Student Loan Refinancing (your “Loan”) for enrolling in SoFi Plus, you must enroll in SoFi Plus within 30 days of Loan funding, either by receiving an Eligible Direct Deposit to your SoFi Checking and Savings account, or by paying the SoFi Plus Subscription Fee. Once eligible, you will receive this discount during periods in which you have received Eligible Direct Deposit to your SoFi Checking and Savings Account, or during periods in which SoFi successfully receives payment of the SoFi Plus Subscription Fee. This discount lowers your interest rate but does not change the amount of your regular monthly payment. This discount will be removed during periods in which SoFi determines you have turned off Eligible Direct Deposit to your Checking and Savings account or in which you have not paid the SoFi Plus Subscription Fee. SoFi reserves the right to change or terminate this interest rate reduction offer for unenrolled participants at any time without notice. You are not required to enroll in Eligible Direct Deposit or to pay the SoFi Plus Subscription Fee to be eligible for Loan approval. See what qualifies as an Eligible Direct Deposit here: www.sofi.com/terms-of-use/#slr-discount.
Terms and conditions apply. SoFi Refinance Student Loans are private loans. When you refinance federal loans with a SoFi loan, YOU FORFEIT YOUR ELIGIBILITY FOR ALL FEDERAL LOAN BENEFITS, including all flexible federal repayment and forgiveness options that are or may become available to federal student loan borrowers including, but not limited to: Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF), Income-Based Repayment, Income-Contingent Repayment, extended repayment plans, PAYE or SAVE. Lowest rates reserved for the most creditworthy borrowers. Learn more at SoFi.com/eligiblity. SoFi Refinance Student Loans are originated by SoFi Bank, N.A. Member FDIC. NMLS #696891 (www.nmlsconsumeraccess.org).

Editor’s Take
The Massachusetts Educational Financing Authority, known as MEFA, is a nonprofit, state-based agency that offers student loan refinancing to customers across the country. It does not require borrowers to have a degree, so those who did not graduate can refinance. It also doesn’t charge fees, including late fees.
While MEFA does not advertise a specific forbearance limit, the agency says it will work with borrowers to modify their payment plans if necessary due to financial hardship. Since the fixed and variable rates offered are currently the same, your best bet is to pick a fixed-rate loan so you know it won’t increase in the future.
Pros & Cons
Interest rate estimate available without undergoing a hard credit check
No late fees
Borrowers can refinance without a degree
Shortest loan term is 7 years
No co-signer release available
Details
Loan terms: Seven, 10 and 15 years
Loan amounts available: $1,500 up to school’s certified cost of attendance less aid.
Eligibility:
No degree required. Minimum FICO score of 670 and minimum income of $24,000 for each loan applicant.
Forbearance options:
No specific policy except in the case of natural disasters or other extenuating circumstances. Loan modification program available on a case-by-case basis to borrowers who need long-term help.
Co-signer release policy:
None

Editor’s Take
Citizens Bank is one of a few lenders that doesn’t require borrowers to have graduated in order to refinance. It also offers co-signer release after 36 loan payments.
The high end of Citizens Bank student loan refinancing rates is quite high compared with other lenders on our list. But borrowers can qualify for an interest rate discount of up to 0.50% if they have an existing account with the bank. (Refinancing is available nationwide, but checking and savings accounts are only available in Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Vermont.)
Pros & Cons
Up to 0.50% in autopay and loyalty discounts
Loan limit of $750,000 for professional degrees
Undisclosed conditions for forbearance
Co-signer release is not available until 36 months
Does not share minimum credit requirement
Details
Loan terms: Five, seven, 10, 15 and 20 years.
Loan amounts: Citizens Bank has a $10,000 to $300,000 (for those with a bachelor’s degrees) or $500,000 (for those with a graduate degree) or $750,000 (for those with a professional degree).
Eligibility: Borrowers must have a bachelor’s degree or above and be a U.S. citizen, permanent resident or nonpermanent resident with a Social Security number.
Forbearance options: Citizens Bank doesn’t share forbearance options publicly. Borrowers must call to determine if payment relief is available.
Co-signer release policy: Borrowers may be eligible for co-signer release after making 36 consecutive on-time payments.

Editor’s Take
Laurel Road, an online-only lender acquired by KeyBank in 2019, offers some perks specific to borrowers who work in health care.
Graduate students and those pursuing bachelor’s degrees in health professions (and, if pursuing an associate’s degree, those in certain health care specialties) can refinance as early as their final semester of school if they have an employment offer. Undergraduates in other fields can refinance after 12 months of employment.
Borrowers also can release their co-signers after 36 monthly payments, and graduates can refinance federal PLUS loans in their own names that their parents took out.
Pros & Cons
Loan terms up to 20 years
0.25% rate discount for using autopay
Up to 0.55% discount for using direct deposit into a Laurel Road checking account
Co-signer release is only available after 36 consecutive payments
Strong credit is necessary to qualify
Details
Loan terms: 5, 7, 10, 15 and 20 years.
Loan amounts: Up to $50,000 in loans for eligible associate degrees in the medical field; 100% of private or federal loan amount for a bachelor’s degree or higher.
Eligibility: Eligible borrowers include professionals with undergraduate or graduate degrees (and certain associate degrees) from accredited schools. Parents can also refinance student loans taken out for a student, regardless of whether the student has graduated.
Forbearance options: Laurel Road may offer up to 12 months of forbearance over the life of the loan in three-month increments.
Co-signer release policy: Borrowers may apply for co-signer release after making 36 consecutive on-time loan payments.

Editor’s Take
Earnest offers several unique features, including the option to make automatic payments twice a month to accelerate repayment and the choice of any repayment term between five and 20 years⁴. It also offers a solid range of hardship repayment options beyond the standard 12 months of forbearance, such as the ability to skip⁵ one monthly bill every year.
Borrowers are able to apply with a co-signer if they don’t qualify for a refinance loan on their own. Earnest reports delinquency to the credit bureaus after the third missed payment cycle.
Pros & Cons
Charges no origination fees, late fees or insufficient fund fees
Offers payment grace periods of up to nine months
Can refinance loans before graduation, if you graduate by the end of the current semester
Co-signer release is not available
Details
Loan terms:
Choose any term from five to 20³. Your options may depend on your financial profile.

¹Terms and conditions apply. To qualify for this Earnest Bonus offer: 1) you must not currently be an Earnest client, or have received the bonus in the past, 2) you must submit a completed student loan refinancing application through the designated Forbes Advisor link; 3) you must provide a valid email address and a valid checking account number during the application process; and 4) your loan must be fully disbursed.
²Student Loan Refinance Interest Rate Disclosure:
Actual rate will vary based on your financial profile. Fixed annual percentage rates (APR) range from 5.00% APR to 10.24% APR (4.75% – 9.99% with .25% auto pay discount). Variable annual percentage rates (APR) range from 6.13% APR to 10.24% APR (5.88% – 9.99% with .25% auto pay discount). Earnest variable interest rate student loan refinance loans are based on a publicly available index, the 30-day Average Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The variable rate is based on the rate published on the 25th day, or the next business day, of the preceding calendar month, rounded to the nearest hundredth of a percent. The rate will not increase more than once a month, but there is no limit on the amount that the rate could increase at one time. Please note, we are not able to offer variable rate loans in AK, IL, MN, NH, OH, TN, and TX. Our lowest rates are only available for our most credit qualified borrowers and require selection of our shortest term offered (5 years) and enrollment in our .25% auto pay discount from a checking or savings account. Enrolling in autopay is not required as a condition for approval.
³Auto Pay Disclosure: You can take advantage of the Auto Pay interest rate reduction by setting up and maintaining active and automatic ACH withdrawal of your loan payment from a checking or savings account. The interest rate reduction for Auto Pay will be available only while your loan is enrolled in Auto Pay. Interest rate incentives for utilizing Auto Pay may not be combined with certain private student loan repayment programs that also offer an interest rate reduction. For multi-party loans, only one party may enroll in Auto Pay.
⁴Student Loan Refinance Loan Cost Examples: These examples provide estimates based on payments beginning immediately upon loan disbursement. Variable APR: A $10,000 loan with a 20-year term (240 monthly payments of $72) and a 5.89% APR would result in a total estimated payment amount of $17,042.39. For a variable loan, after your starting rate is set, your rate will then vary with the market. Fixed APR: A $10,000 loan with a 20-year term (240 monthly payments of $72) and a 6.04% APR would result in a total estimated payment amount of $17,249.77. Your actual repayment terms may vary.
⁵Skip A Payment Disclosure: Earnest clients may skip one payment every 12 months. Your first request to skip a payment can be made once you’ve made at least 6 months of consecutive on-time payments, and your loan is in good standing. The interest accrued during the skipped month will result in an increase in your remaining minimum payment. The final payoff date on your loan will be extended by the length of the skipped payment periods. Please be aware that a skipped payment does count toward the forbearance limits. Please note that skipping a payment is not guaranteed and is at Earnest’s discretion. Your monthly payment and total loan cost may increase as a result of postponing your payment and extending your term.
Loan Eligibility Criteria: Your debt is from paying for education at a Title IV accredited school. The debt is from your education or your child’s. The debt you’re refinancing is for a completed degree or one that will be completed at the end of this semester. You are currently the primary borrower on the student loans you would like to refinance, and you will remain the primary borrower after refinancing. You must reside in the District of Columbia or one of the 47 states Earnest Operations LLC is authorized to lend in (all but Delaware, Kentucky, and Nevada). This is strictly a student loan refinance product. There is no opportunity to borrow more than your outstanding qualifying student loan amount. You must be the age of majority in your state or older at the time you apply, as well as be a United States citizen or Permanent Resident Alien without conditions. Refinancing is subject to credit qualifications. Please note, we are not able to offer variable rate loans in AK, IL, MN, NH, OH, TN, and TX.
You may lose benefits associated with your underlying federal and/or private loans if you refinance such as federal Income-driven Repayment Plans, Economic Hardship Deferment, Public Service Loan Forgiveness, or other deferment and forbearance options. If you file for bankruptcy, you may still be required to pay back this loan.

How To Compare Student Loan Refinance Lenders
Before applying for a refinance loan for your student debt, compare each lender’s main features and how they’d work for your unique situation. If you’re interested in refinancing to pay down your loans faster, loan terms may hold more weight for you than forbearance options do.
Check rate offerings. Refinancing student loans can be a great way to save money on interest, so you’ll want to consider lenders offering the lowest rates. Interest rates on variable-rate loans usually run lower than their fixed-rate counterparts, but they could increase over time. You should only opt for a variable rate if you plan to pay off your loan quickly.
Weigh loan terms. Each refinance lender on our list offers various loan terms. Take some time to think about how long you want to be in repayment and what’s realistic for you and your financial goals.
Look at forbearance and payment options. Similar to private student loans, private refinance loans don’t feature the same consumer protections and benefits as federal loans. However, if you have difficulty making payments, some refinance lenders offer more than the standard 12 months of forbearance. Before deciding on a lender, consider each one’s forbearance policy and payment options.
Consider co-signer options. If you have a co-signer on your refinance journey, you can choose a lender that offers a co-signer release policy. That way, you can take over the full repayment responsibility when possible and protect your co-signer’s credit if you’re past due on your payments.
Pro Tip
Before applying with a lender to refinance your student loans, check your credit report for errors. If you find any, dispute them with the three credit reporting agencies. It’s important to check for errors before applying for any loans. Errors can hurt your credit score, and you may not receive the lowest possible interest rate.
How Does Refinancing Student Loans Work?
When you refinance student loans, you take out a new loan to pay off your existing student debt. Your new loan will have a new interest rate and repayment term. This means you could potentially pay less in interest or lower your monthly payments. Borrowers can refinance to combine multiple student loans into one loan and payment, which can make repayment easier.
Refinancing is only done through private lenders. If you refinance federal student loans, they become private loans and you will lose access to federal benefits like income-driven repayment plans, loan forgiveness programs and more flexible deferment and forbearance options.
If you want to keep your federal student loan benefits instead of refinancing, consider a direct consolidation loan. This averages all your student loan interest rates and rounds up to the nearest one-eighth percent. Your new repayment period, with one monthly payment for your loans, can be as long as 30 years and you retain all federal benefits.
If you don’t mind losing federal student loan benefits or only have private student loans, refinancing may be a better option for you. You can use a student loan refinance calculator to determine how refinancing can help you save money or lower payments.
Student Loan Refinance Requirements
Eligibility requirements for student loan refinancing vary by lender, but borrowers generally must meet the following criteria:
Good to excellent credit. Lenders typically require borrowers to have good to excellent credit, meaning a credit score of 670 or higher.
Steady income. You’ll need to meet the lender’s income and employment requirements. For example, the lender may require you to be employed full-time and have a salary of at least $35,000 per year.
Minimum loan balance. Most lenders require a minimum outstanding loan balance to qualify for refinancing. The minimum varies by lender, but it’s usually between $5,000 and $10,000.
If you don’t meet those requirements, you could still qualify for a private student loan if you add a creditworthy co-signer to your loan application.
Pros and Cons of Refinancing Student Loans
Student loan refinancing can be an excellent way to manage your debt, but it’s important to weigh your options and research the pros and cons carefully.
Pros of Refinancing Student Loans
You could save money. If you refinance your loans and qualify for a lower interest rate, you could save hundreds or even thousands over your loan term.
Simplify payments. Most borrowers take out several loans to pay for their college education, and keeping track of the different loans and payments can be stressful. When you refinance your loans, you can combine them into one loan and have just one account to manage and an easy-to-remember payment due date.
Pay off your loans faster. With a lower interest rate, more of your payments will go toward the loan’s principal rather than interest. If you make additional payments, you could pay off your loans much faster.
Cons of Refinancing Student Loans
Lose federal loan benefits. If you refinance federal student loans, you will transfer them to a private lender. They’ll no longer qualify for federal benefits like income-driven repayment, Public Service Loan Forgiveness or federal forbearance programs.
Not everyone qualifies for a lower rate. Refinancing companies have strict eligibility requirements and depending on your existing loans, you may be not eligible for a lower rate than you have now.
You may need a co-signer. Because the eligibility requirements are stringent, you may need a co-signer to qualify for a loan. Co-signing a refinancing loan is a major commitment since student loans can be in repayment for 10 to 20 years.
Should I Refinance My Student Loans?
Before you decide to refinance your student loans, consider your financial history, interest rates and repayment needs.
First, identify whether you qualify. Most student refinance lenders require a minimum credit score of 650. You’ll also generally need to show consistent income, a low debt-to-income (DTI) ratio and on-time payments in your credit history.
If you’re eligible to refinance, look at your current loans’ interest rates. Refinancing might make sense for you if your interest rates are significantly higher than the rate you’ll likely get if you refinance.
Keep in mind that if you refinance federal student loans, you’ll lose access to federal programs such as flexible forbearance, income-based repayment and Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF).
You should consider student loan refinancing if you have a good or excellent credit score and stable income (or a co-signer who does) and your current loans have high enough interest rates that you’ll benefit from a lower rate.
How To Get the Best Student Loan Refinancing Rate
Getting a competitive rate on loan refinancing can save you thousands on interest and shave off years from your repayment timeline. Below are tips for getting the best rate:
Clean up your credit. Reducing your credit utilization, disputing incorrect records on your credit report and making all existing debt payments on time before refinancing could improve your credit score so you can land better loan rates.
Increase your income. Besides your credit, your income is another factor lenders consider when setting rates. Having a job with a high and reliable income could improve your interest rate options.
Find a creditworthy co-signer. Adding a co-signer with strong credit (700 or above) to your loan application can reduce your rate. Some lenders also offer co-signer release after you make a certain number of payments, so the co-signer doesn’t have to stay on your loan for the entire term.
Don’t accept the first offer. Shopping with multiple lenders before choosing a loan is the best way to find the best deal. Often, lenders let you prequalify without a hard credit inquiry so you can compare many options without taking a credit hit.
Sign up for autopay. Some lenders offer a 0.25% to 1.00% rate discount for using autopay, reducing your rate even further.
How to Refinance Student Loans
If refinancing makes sense for your situation, you can start the process immediately. Here’s how to refinance your loans:
1. Shop around before you apply. Most refinancing lenders allow you to prequalify for a loan. To do so, you’ll enter a few personal details and the lender will complete a soft credit check—which has no impact on your credit score—before showing your estimated fixed and variable interest rates for your desired loan. Do this with several lenders to see who might offer the best deals.
2. Submit an application. Once you’ve decided which lender you want to work with, submit a formal application. This is a more in-depth form, and you may need to include extra documentation about your income and other details. The lender will then do a hard credit check to confirm your information. If you’re approved, you’ll receive an overview of the final loan terms. Review the documents, and if all looks good, you can sign the paperwork to receive your loan.
3. Confirm your old loan is closed, then start making payments. Your new lender will likely pay off your old loan directly. However, keep making payments on your old debt until you receive confirmation that it’s been paid off and your account has been closed. Once that happens, you’ll start making regular payments to your new lender on your refinanced loan.
How To Refinance Student Loans With Bad Credit
Applying with a co-signer is likely the best way to qualify for student loan refinancing when you have bad credit. A co-signer guarantees repayment of your loan if you default, which reduces risk for the lender and can help you qualify for a loan with a better interest rate.
The ideal co-signer is someone you trust with a good payment history and a FICO Score of 670 or higher. When using a co-signer, paying on time is crucial since late payments can affect both of your credit scores. If you default on the loan, the lender can sue you and your co-signer for the unpaid debt.
Talking with potential co-signers about your employment prospects and repayment plans after school could help them feel more confident about doing you a favor.

Methodology
We requested data from 16 lenders that dominate the student loan refinance market and scored them across 15 data points in the categories of interest rates, fees, loan terms, hardship options, application process and eligibility. We chose the 10 best to display based on those earning three stars or higher.
The following is the weighting assigned to each category:
Hardship options: 30%
Eligibility: 18%
Loan terms: 18%
Application process: 16%
Interest rates: 13%
Fees: 5%
Specific characteristics taken into consideration within each category included number of months of forbearance available, hardship repayment options beyond traditional forbearance, availability of in-school deferment, accessibility to borrowers without a bachelor’s degree, time to default, disclosure of credit score and income requirements and other factors.
Lenders who offered interest rates below 7% scored the highest, as did those who offered more than the standard 12 months of forbearance, who offered interest rate discounts beyond the standard 0.25% for automatic payments, who charged no late fees and who offered multiple loan terms maxing out at 15 years. We believe that to take full advantage of refinancing, borrowers should choose the shortest loan term available, and a 20-year term has the potential to limit interest savings.
In some cases, lenders were awarded partial points, and a maximum of 3% of the final score was left to editorial discretion based on the quality of consumer-friendly features offered.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
Which student loans should I refinance?
Your safest bet is to refinance high-interest private loans. That’s because you won’t lose potentially useful federal repayment options, including up to three years of deferment or forbearance.
You do not have to refinance all of your loans, so consider keeping federal loans out of your refinance package.
If you do not plan to make use of any federal loan benefits—or you want to refinance so that you can pay off loans very quickly—it’s possible to refinance federal loans. Consider doing so, though, after the Covid-19 monthly payment freeze has ended.
When is the best time to refinance student loans?
Many lenders require a degree in order to refinance, so it’s best to wait until you’ve graduated. Some lenders have more relaxed degree requirements, but they may want to see a history of on-time student loan payments for a period of time first (say, 12 months). You also typically must be out of school before refinancing, with some exceptions.
If you don’t yet meet the credit and income requirements but you want to refinance anyway, it’s possible to use a co-signer. Due to the risk to their credit score the co-signer takes on, though, it’s ideal to wait to refinance until you have the financial profile to be eligible as the sole borrower. You can take the time to improve your credit score and refinance later on.
What is ‘co-signer release?’
Some refinance lenders offer to release the co-signer from a loan after the borrower makes a certain number of payments. That can protect the co-signer from a credit hit as a result of the primary borrower’s negative payment history. If you plan to use co-signer release, check your loan documents to see when it will be possible (in 36 months, for instance) and what additional requirements you might need to meet.
Can you refinance a student loan more than once?
You can refinance a student loan more than once if you meet a lender’s requirements for refinancing. There’s typically no cost to refinance student loans, so refinancing multiple times could be worthwhile if it would save you money or achieve another goal, such as switching from a variable rate to a fixed one in a rising-rate environment.
How long does it take to refinance student loans?
The processing time for student loan refinancing can vary by person and lender. Generally, refinancing could take a few weeks or several months, depending on how quickly you turn in loan documentation and receive approval. You should continue making payments on your old student loans to keep old loans in good standing until your new loan pays them off.
How much will I save by refinancing my student loans?
The amount you can save on your student loans depends on a few factors, including your loan balances, interest rates and repayment terms.
For example, let’s say you owe $28,950 in student loans with an 8% interest rate. If you could refinance to a 6% rate, you’d save $3,059 in interest charges over a 10-year repayment term.
Our student loan refinance calculator can help you compare your current loans with a student loan refinance offer to determine your potential savings.
Can I refinance student loans to a lower rate?
Whether you can refinance your student loans to a lower rate depends on several factors, including:
– The current rate on your loans
– Your credit score and credit history
– Your income and other debt
– Whether you have a co-signer on your loan application
Luckily, many refinancing companies allow you to get a rate quote with a soft credit check, which doesn’t hurt your credit.
Is refinancing student loans better than consolidation?
Student loan refinancing and consolidation are two similar, but distinctly different, processes. With refinancing, you combine all your old loans into a new debt. The interest rate on the refinanced loan is determined by your creditworthiness, and if you have excellent credit, you could reap significant savings by getting a lower rate. Only private lenders offer refinancing, so your refinanced debt will be a private student loan.
Student loan consolidation, however, typically refers to a direct consolidation loan. This is a federal program that allows borrowers to combine multiple federal student loans into one consolidation loan. It remains federal debt, so you keep all the same protections. However, the new interest rate on your consolidated loan is simply a weighted average of your old rates. That means you won’t save money with consolidation.
Refinancing and consolidation both have their pros and cons, and the right option for you depends on your financial situation and goals.
