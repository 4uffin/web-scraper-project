Our Expert Take
We’re impressed by Travelers’ low rates, wide variety of coverage options and decent digital experience. These elements combined to push Travelers to the top of our rankings. Travelers’ rates are well below the nationwide average for every driver profile we analyzed, making it a terrific company to shop rates with. Upgrade coverage packages allow you to customize your policy, such as Travelers’ Responsible Driver Plan that includes accident forgiveness and minor violation forgiveness.

Travelers’ car insurance customers generally appreciate its competitive costs and reliable claims handling. However, there’s notable criticism about its customer service responsiveness and frequent rate increases without clear reasons. While many customers report positive experiences with Travelers, some note challenges with its claims process and communication.
Pros & Cons
Its new car replacement coverage lasts five years instead of the standard two to three years that others offer.
Discount for hybrid or electric vehicles.
Rideshare insurance endorsement available for Lyft and Uber drivers.
Very low level of car insurance complaints logged against Travelers with state insurance departments.
Doesn’t offer SR-22 insurance.
Received only a C grade from repair specialists for its claim repair processes.
Available in only 42 states.

Erie stands out for excelling in handling claims. It received the highest grade (A-) among the insurers we evaluated, based on grades from auto body specialists for its collision repair claims process. And 90% of Erie customers we surveyed who have filed a claim were satisfied with the claims process, that’s the highest satisfaction rate in our survey. Erie also offers great rates for many driver types and provides a wide range of coverage options, with some automatically included at no extra cost.

Erie’s car insurance customers praise its coverage options and competitive costs (particularly for drivers with a clean record). There’s frequently positive experience with customer service, though some report inconsistencies in communication and claims handling. Overall, Erie customers appreciate its cost competitiveness, although some note occasional issues with rate increases and policy cancellations.
Pros & Cons
Superb rates for good drivers and drivers with issues, like a speeding ticket or accident on their record.
Low rates for teens, young adults and seniors.
Erie’s Rate Lock freezes your premium so it stays the same year after year.
Great average discount of 10% for paying in full.
Low level of auto insurance complaints made against Erie to state insurance departments.
Only available in 12 states.
Its digital experience is just OK. Its app received low marks from users and its website lacks a live chat feature.
You can obtain a quote online, but you must connect with an agent to buy a policy.
Its usage-based insurance program, YourTurn, doesn’t offer a discount for safe driving but rewards through gift cards to various retailers.

We like Nationwide because it offers the lowest rates available to the general public for good drivers, those with poor credit or a speeding ticket and those who have caused an accident with injury. (USAA is slightly cheaper for a few of the driver profiles, but it sells exclusively to the military community.) Nationwide also has a terrific lineup of coverage options to tailor a policy to your specific needs, such as accident and minor violation forgiveness, new car replacement and a vanishing deductible if you don’t make claims.

Low level of car insurance complaints made against Nationwide to state insurance regulators.
Has a Spanish version of its website.
Doesn’t offer rideshare insurance.
Poor digital experience, in part because we were unable to obtain online quotes.

USAA stands out for its wide range of coverage options and discounts designed specifically for military members. For example, there’s a 15% discount if you garage your car on a military base. And if you store your vehicle during deployment, you can save as much as 60%. USAA rates are fantastic for military members, having the lowest prices in our analysis for drivers who have caused an accident with injury or property damage, as well as those with speeding tickets. It offers a robust lineup of coverage options, allowing you to customize your policy.

Our Expert Take
Geico’s competitive rates make it a strong contender for many types of drivers, especially those with poor credit. Geico makes it easy to get quotes online and is available nationwide. But its coverage options are somewhat limited: It doesn’t offer new car replacement, gap insurance, rideshare insurance or a vanishing deductible.

We like that Progressive offers three types of accident forgiveness to help keep your rates from increasing if you’ve caused an accident. Many companies offer one type of accident forgiveness, if that. Also, Progressive offers competitive rates for a variety of drivers, including having the cheapest rates for drivers with a DUI conviction among the companies we analyzed. Its attractive rates span across age groups, too, with lower-than-average rates for teens, young adults and seniors. Low-cost rates, combined with a good variety of coverage options, make it worth checking out.

Progressive car insurance customers praise it for providing competitive rates at first. It’s a popular choice for drivers switching from other insurers like Geico and USAA. However, many customers complain about issues with Progressive’s claims handling and significant rate hikes upon renewal, undermining the initial savings.
Pros & Cons
Offers vanishing deductible.
Provides rideshare insurance, nonowner car insurance and SR-22 filings.
Low level of complaints made to state insurance departments.
Available nationwide and you can get a quote and buy a policy online.
No new car replacement coverage.
Received only a C grade for the last four years from auto repair experts for its collision claim process.
Progressive’s usage-based program (Snapshot) may get you a decent discount, but your rates could increase instead if your driving score is low. Progressive says rates go up for 20% of drivers who use Snapshot.

Best for Accident Forgiveness: Progressive
Progressive offers three types of accident forgiveness to help prevent rate hikes after an accident. That’s beneficial because our analysis found that rates go up 50% on average after an accident with injury and 48% after a property damage accident.
Some competitors don’t offer accident forgiveness while others have just one option. Progressive offers three that don’t cost you extra. Here’s what Progressive offers for accident forgiveness:
Small accident forgiveness. Makes it so your rates won’t go up for claims of $500 or less. Automatically included at the start of your policy (in most states).
Large accident forgiveness. Keeps your rates from rising for accident claims of over $500. Earned after being with Progressive for five years and having no accidents or violations on your record during that time. Part of their Loyalty rewards program.
Purchased accident forgiveness. Can be used on a large accident before you qualify for the earned accident forgiveness coverage or can be used if you have another eligible claim after already using your loyalty accident forgiveness coverage during your current policy period.
Best for Family Discounts: Westfield
Compared to other top-rated companies, Westfield has an excellent assortment of discounts so family members can save on auto insurance. It offers a family discount, next generation discount and companion car insurance discount.
Family Discount
A discount for teen drivers 18 or younger who are added to a parent's auto policy that has been in effect for at least the last three years.
Next Generation Discount
For young drivers ages 22 to 29 and are coming off a parent’s Westfield car insurance policy to buy their own policy.
Companion Discount
For drivers who buy car insurance and who have someone in their households who already has an auto policy with Westfield.
Best Digital Experience: Geico
We analyzed mobile app ratings and website functionality to see if auto insurers are keeping up with increasing demands for a delightful digital experience. We found that Geico has the overall best digital experience among the top-rated companies in our analysis.

Shop Around Frequently
When it comes to auto insurance shopping advice, early, often and regularly are the three watchwords to remember. I recommend making insurance shopping a regular exercise and not once a decade, when you trade in a vehicle or only when rates go up. Take advantage of all your resources—call your company to ask for discounts, use the internet to get multiple quotes, ask a local agent to describe options and don’t forget to ask your family and neighbors.
Marty Ellingsworth
Advisory Board Member
Don’t Overlook Small Insurers
I recommend looking at companies of all sizes when searching for the best insurance company. If you count out small insurers, you may miss out on a company that offers good coverage perks and superb rates.
Penny Gusner
Insurance Senior Writer
Confirm There’s a Mobile App
If digital experience is important to you, make sure the insurer you’re considering has a mobile app. Believe it or not, not all insurers do! I like to have the ability to show my insurance ID card from my phone, for example.
Michelle Megna
Insurance Lead Editor
Don’t Skimp on Liability Insurance
With an increasingly litigious society, I think it’s very important to make sure you have generous liability insurance. If you haven’t paid much attention to this line item on your declarations page, I recommend taking a look. You want enough liability insurance to equal your net worth, which is essentially what you can be sued for. Buy umbrella insurance for extra liability insurance at a good price.
Les Masterson
Insurance Editor
Be Careful With Usage-Based Insurance
Auto insurance companies may recommend that you join their usage-based auto insurance program to get discounts. I’d say this isn’t a good choice if you like your privacy. Your data could be shared with others and may affect future car insurance quotes and rates. Also, most people in these telematic programs don’t drive well enough in the eyes of insurers to get a significant discount.
Ashlee Valentine
Insurance Editor
Consider Rental Reimbursement Insurance
I think rental reimbursement insurance is an underappreciated coverage. Car repair times have been going up. Your vehicle could easily be in the shop for a collision repair for three weeks or more, waiting to get worked on and waiting for parts. This coverage can help pay for a rental, so you’re not footing the whole bill yourself.
Jason Metz

How To Buy Car Insurance
Here are six steps to help you navigate the car insurance buying process.
Determine Your Car Insurance Needs
You must decide how much car insurance you need. This includes determining your liability limits and whether you need full coverage, which covers your car.
Gather Driver and Vehicle Information
You’ll need to share personal information with insurers to get quotes and buy car insurance. That includes the names, birth dates, driver’s license numbers and driving histories for every household driver. You’ll also share the make, model and VIN for every vehicle you want to insure.
Comparison Shop for Car Insurance
Auto insurance costs vary greatly from one company to the next for the same coverage, so shopping around lets you find the best car insurance company for your specific needs. You can shop online or call agents to get a quote. Getting quotes can be fairly easy if you’re ready with driver and car information and know what coverage you want.
Buy Your Auto Insurance Policy
You can buy online with many auto insurers, but some require contacting an agent. If you’ve already received a quote, finishing up the process and buying typically doesn’t take much longer. Having your information handy speeds up the process, so that it can take less than half an hour to get a quote and buy with some insurers.
Know Your Policy’s Start Date
Ensure you know the date and time your car insurance policy will become active. Your policy will be effective immediately upon payment with some auto insurers. With others, it can take a few days to start.
Cancel Your Previous Policy
If you’re switching car insurance companies, you can cancel your previous policy after your new policy is active. Don’t cancel your old policy until the new policy is in place, or you face penalties for a gap in coverage.
How Much Does Car Insurance Cost?
Car insurance costs an average of $179 a month, based on our analysis of full coverage rates. That comes to $2,149 a year on average for an auto policy that pays if you harm others in an auto accident and covers your car if damaged in an accident or by severe weather, fire or theft.
Pro Tip
State minimum car insurance costs an average of $53 a month. A minimum car insurance policy costs much less—only $631 a year on average—because it doesn’t provide coverage for your car.
Methodology
To identify the best car insurance companies we evaluated each company based on its average rates for a variety of drivers, the coverage options offered, complaints against the company, digital experience, collision repair grades from auto body professionals and our surveys of customer service, pricing and claims satisfaction.
Auto insurance rates (40% of score): We analyzed average rates from each company for good drivers, drivers who have caused an accident, drivers with a speeding ticket, drivers with a DUI, drivers with poor credit and drivers caught without insurance.
Unless otherwise noted, rates are based on a 40-year-old female driver with a Toyota RAV4 and coverage of:
$100,000 for injuries to one person, $300,000 for injuries per accident and $100,000 of property damage (known as 100/300/100).
Uninsured motorist coverage of 100/300.
Collision and comprehensive insurance with a $500 deductible.
Source: Quadrant Information Services.
Car insurance coverage options (20% of score): Any auto insurance company can provide the basics of liability insurance, collision and comprehensive coverage and other standard offerings. But it’s also important to have access to additional coverage types that can provide greater protection or cost savings. In this category, we gave points to companies that offer:
Accident forgiveness
Gap insurance
New car replacement
Nonowners policies
Usage-based insurance
Pay-per-mile insurance
Rideshare insurance
SR-22s
Vanishing deductibles
Source: Forbes Advisor research.
Complaints (15% of score): We used complaint data from state departments of insurance across the country. Most auto insurance complaints center on claims, including unsatisfactory settlements, delays, and denials.
Source: National Association of Insurance Commissioners.
The industry complaint average is 1.00, so companies with a ratio below 1.00 have lower levels of complaints.
Collision repair (5% of score): We incorporated insurance company grades from collision repair professionals. We used data provided by CRASH Network, a weekly newsletter covering the collision repair and auto insurance market segments.
Source: CRASH Network’s Insurer Report Card provides grades from more than 1,100 collision repair professionals to gauge auto insurers on the quality of their collision claims service.

Mobile app ratings for Android and Apple.
If there’s a useful website search function.
If there’s a live chat that provides helpful information.
If there’s a Spanish version of the website.
If you can get a quote online.
Source: Forbes Advisor research.
Likelihood to recommend car insurers to others (5% of score) and satisfaction with customer service and price (5% of score): We surveyed 3,000 American drivers with car insurance who purchased a new policy or renewed their policy within the last 12 months, 200 per company.
Source: This online survey was commissioned by Forbes Advisor and conducted by market research company Talker Research, in accordance with the Market Research Society’s code of conduct. Data was collected from October 11-29, 2024. The margin of error is ± 1.5 point with 95% confidence.

Best Car Insurance Companies Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
How can I find the best price on car insurance?
The key to finding a good deal is to get car insurance quotes from multiple companies. That’s the only way you’ll know what companies are going to charge and which companies are coming in with the lowest rates.
Another good savings strategy is to bundle auto insurance with another policy, such as homeowners or renters insurance. Buying more than one policy from the same company typically results in a decent discount.
Do I need car insurance to drive?
Yes, in almost all states, you need car insurance to drive. Liability insurance—which includes bodily injury liability coverage and property damage liability coverage—is mandatory in nearly every state. That’s so you can pay for the harm you cause others in an auto accident.
New Hampshire does not require car insurance. However, if you’re in a car crash there you need to show proof of financial responsibility. Having an auto insurance policy is the easiest way to show such evidence.
What factors impact the cost of car insurance?
Common car insurance rating factors that impact the cost of car insurance include your age, driving record, location, auto insurance claims history and credit-based insurance score (in states that allow it). Other factors that determine your rates are the make and model of your car and the coverages, limits and deductibles you choose for your policy.
