Our Expert Take
High-net-worth homeowners will likely appreciate Nationwide’s Private Client insurance, which includes a cash-out option if your residence is destroyed and you decide not to rebuild. That best-rated coverage also reimburses you for accidental breakage of items such as crystal and china, as well as equipment breakdown coverage for appliances and home systems.

No banned dog list

Customers appreciated USAA’s military focus, bundling discounts and home insurance coverage. On the other hand, consumer complaints included frequent rate increases and problematic claims processes. USAA ranked last for customer service in this analysis.
Pros & Cons
Offers extended replacement cost for dwellings
Excellent digital experience and allows you to file claims and get quotes online
Provides many discounts through the USAA perks program, including hotels, rental cars, sports, concerts, theme parks, cruises, car care, home security and prescription medications
Available only to active military personnel and veterans and their families
Doesn’t offer guaranteed replacement coverage, which covers costs to rebuild your home, regardless of amount, if it’s destroyed

USAA has much better complaint levels than the average. This result can signify strong customer satisfaction.

Our Expert Take
We like that Westfield has one of the lowest average prices among the top-rated home insurance providers in our analysis. Only Progressive has cheaper rates, but Westfield offers coverage perks like extended replacement cost or guaranteed replacement coverage that Progressive doesn’t.
More: Westfield Home Insurance Review
Pros & Cons
Low complaint level indicates overall customer satisfaction, making it a highly reputable company
Some Westfield home insurance policies include equipment breakdown coverage
Wespak package bundles home and auto insurance into one policy, including one bill and a shared deductible, which can help if you have a single incident that damages both your car and home
Estatepak home insurance, which is designed for high-value homes, combines luxury home coverage with auto insurance
Offers homeowners insurance in only 10 states
Customers may encounter a banned dog list
3-Year Complaint Trend
Westfield has a better-than-average complaint ratio to state departments of insurance compared to the industry average over the past three years, though the ratio increased in 2024.
Great for Extended Coverage for Dwellings
American Family

Our Expert Take
We think you should check out American Family if you’re looking for coverage that goes beyond a policy’s dwelling limit and you live in one of the 19 states that have American Family policies. Extended replacement and guaranteed replacement cost coverage are policy add-ons with American Family that allow you to go beyond your dwelling coverage limit. This may be important if you need to rebuild your home, but local building costs and inflation have pushed the cost to rebuild your home beyond your dwelling limit.

American Family homeowners insurance ranked highest provider for customer service in this analysis and received praise for its competitive rates, especially when bundling home and auto insurance policies. While some customers commend American Family for its smooth claims handling, others criticize it for poor communication, issues with policy cancellations or downgrades without sufficient notice, and substantial rate increases.
Pros & Cons
Low complaint levels for home insurance
Doesn’t have a banned dog list
Offers many discounts, such as lower rates for homes with a smart home device that detects risks like fires and water leaks, newly purchased or renovated home, and bundling policies
Higher than average home insurance rates
Not available in many states
3-Year Complaint Trend
American Family home insurance has had low complaint levels over the past three years.

Our Expert Take
Country Financial has one of the lowest complaint ratios to state insurance departments of the companies we researched. A low ratio can be a gauge of customer satisfaction. Another reason why we like Country Financial is that it offers both extended and guaranteed replacement cost coverage. That expanded coverage can help you, especially during times of high building costs and inflation.
More: Country Financial Home Insurance Review
Pros & Cons
Large list of discounts, which includes bundling, new roof, claims-free and loyalty discounts to help reduce your rates
No banned dog list, but some breeds have liability limits
Allows you to file claims online and the company’s website search functionality is excellent
Higher than average home insurance rates

State Farm customers praised the insurance company for its bundling discounts and customer service, but others criticized its claim handling and home insurance rates. There were also complaints for delayed claims and denied claims.
Pros & Cons
Offers an option for extended replacement cost coverage that extends your insurance limit when rebuilding costs are more than your stated dwelling coverage amount
No banned dog list
Provides home policies in all 50 states, so it should be easy to find a policy
Lets you get quotes online and its app lets you file claims
High complaint levels to state departments of insurance
State Farm agents will be knowledgeable about the company’s products but won’t help you compare other insurers
3-Year Complaint Trend
State Farm has generally been around the industry average for home insurance complaints, though higher than top competitors.
Best for High Liability Limits
Chubb

Our Expert Take
Owners of high-value homes will appreciate Chubb’s high liability coverage limits, which can reach $100 million. That may be worthwhile if you have millions of assets you want to protect in case you’re sued. The company also offers the option to receive a cash settlement if your house is destroyed and you don’t wish to rebuild.

How Homeowners Can Find the Best Home Insurance
The best home insurance isn’t the same for everyone. Work with an insurance agent who can explain what home insurance covers and guide you in selecting the right coverage based on your property, family and situation. Knowing how home insurance works can help you identify the best home insurance providers for your specific circumstances.
Let’s look at a few common situations.
First-Time Homebuyers
Before shopping, first-time home insurance buyers should understand the types of home insurance found in standard policies. You’ll also want to choose the right home insurance deductible and understand how much liability coverage you need.
You Own Valuable Items
If you have expensive items like jewelry, antiques or artwork, you can find top-rated house insurance providers that will let you schedule personal property. That covers those items separately from your personal property insurance and insures their full value outside the policy limit.
You Have an Aggressive Dog
Homeowners with dog breeds that are “aggressive” may run into a banned dog list. Some residential home insurance providers exclude certain dog breeds from liability insurance. You may even get denied if you have a dog breed on a banned list, but not all insurers have banned dog lists.
Your Property Is at Risk for Flooding
Standard home insurance for residences doesn’t cover flood damage, so you’ll need to buy separate flood insurance if you want flood coverage. Flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance Program caps dwelling coverage at $250,000, but you may buy more coverage through a private insurer.
You’ve Made Numerous Claims
Insurers typically view people with multiple claims as high-risk and charge more for coverage, so you may have trouble finding affordable home insurance. Ways to cut your home insurance cost include choosing a higher home insurance deductible, bundling your home and auto policies, improving your credit if possible and maximizing discounts.
How to Compare the Best Home Insurance Companies
We suggest taking these steps to find the best home insurance.
Determine how much coverage you need: Review each basic coverage type and adjust the limits to fit your specific needs. Make sure you have enough dwelling coverage to properly cover your home if it’s destroyed.
Buy more coverage if you need it: You may find that you need additional coverage, such as higher liability limits and extended replacement or guaranteed replacement coverage. You can also buy umbrella insurance from top rated home insurance carriers, if your assets are beyond the policy’s liability limits.
Fill in gaps: Your house insurance doesn’t cover all types of damage, but you can buy supplemental coverage like insurance for floods, earthquakes, water and sump overflow.
Compare home insurance quotes: It’s smart to compare home insurance quotes from multiple insurance companies.
Insurers’ rates can vary considerably for the same coverage, so it’s good to compare quotes from at least three reputable home insurance providers.
Maximize home insurance discounts: Most reliable home insurance providers offer home insurance discounts that can reduce your policy costs. Bundling auto and home insurance often gets the best discounts, but you can also save by installing a security, fire safety or water leak-detection devices, going paperless, being a new customer, staying with a company for many years, renovating your home or multiple other ways. Talk to the insurance company about its discounts when getting quotes.

Get the Right Dwelling Coverage Amount
Any reputable home insurance carrier or agent should be able to provide an estimate of how much it would cost to rebuild your house. This should be your dwelling coverage amount. One common mistake I’ve seen is that people confuse this amount with the real estate market value, but it’s not the same. And don’t include land value.

Ask About a Bundling Discount
One of the best insurance discounts is for bundling home and auto policies. We found that State Farm beats competitors with an average 23% multi-policy discount.

Get Multiple Quotes So You Know What’s a Good Deal
When shopping for home insurance, I recommend making sure you get quotes for the same coverage from at least three insurers. That will allow you to accurately determine who offers the best budget-friendly residential home insurance rates.

Methodology
To identify the best home insurance companies, we analyzed costs around the country, policy information and complaints against insurers. We scored companies based on these factors:
Home insurance rates (40% of score): We analyzed average rates for each insurance company for homes with dwelling coverage of $200,000, $350,000, $500,000 and $750,000 with 50% personal property coverage, 10% loss of use coverage, a $500 deductible, $1,000 guest medical coverage and $100,000 liability coverage for a 40-year-old woman with good credit.

Complaints (20% of score): We used complaint data from state insurance departments across the country. Most home insurance complaints center on claims, including delays, unsatisfactory settlements and denials.
Source: National Association of Insurance Commissioners.
Availability of extended and/or guaranteed replacement cost coverage (20% of score): Extra dwelling coverage is valuable in the event of large disasters, when construction materials and labor costs tend to spike. We gave points to companies that offer either extended or guaranteed replacement cost coverage.
Source: Forbes Advisor research.
Digital experience (10% of score): We analyzed the quality of each company’s mobile app and website. We evaluated home insurers on:
If there’s a mobile app.
If you can submit claims online.
If you can pay online.
If there’s a useful website search function.
If there’s a live chat that provides helpful information.
If the company has a Facebook account that is updated regularly.
If you can get a quote online.

Banned dog lists (10% of score): Banned dog breed lists can make homeowners ineligible for coverage. (A company’s banned dog list might not be applicable in all states.) While any homeowners insurance company could potentially ban any dog with a biting history, not all put a ban on specific breeds.

Best Homeowners Insurance Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
What Is homeowners insurance?
Homeowners insurance is a contract between you and an insurance company that specifies how you’re compensated if your home and belongings are damaged due to unexpected events. It also outlines how you’re paid if you or your household members are liable for others’ injuries and property damage. This coverage is for people who own homes and townhomes.
Who has the cheapest home insurance?
The cheapest home insurance companies are Progressive, Westfield, State Farm and USAA, based on our analysis.
Those are good starting points, but the most cost-effective home insurance carrier for you will vary depending on your location and the type of house you’re insuring. Shop around for a few home insurance quotes. And if you’re also getting car insurance quotes, ask about a discount for bundling auto and home insurance with the same company.
How do I file a homeowners insurance claim?
Contact the home insurance company or your insurance agent to file a home insurance claim over the phone, through the company’s website, chat, email or app, depending on the company. You want to document the loss by providing information about the cause, when it happened and a list of what was lost.
If your home was damaged, you should try to prevent more damage, such as boarding up a broken window. We wouldn’t suggest fixing the problem before contacting your insurance company. The insurer may want to send an adjuster to observe the damage. You should also keep damaged items so the insurer can document. Once the insurance company is done with its investigation, the insurer will offer a claims payout.
Is flood insurance included with my homeowners policy?
No, flood insurance isn’t typically covered as part of a home insurance policy. You instead need to buy a separate flood insurance policy.
You can purchase a National Flood Insurance Program policy from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or from a private insurance company.
How are homeowners insurance claims paid?
A claims adjuster will estimate the amount it will cost to fix your house and repair or replace damaged items. You’ll get an insurance check for that amount, minus your deductible and only up to your policy’s limits.
One of the best ways you can speed up your claims process and maximize your payment is by creating a home inventory. A good home inventory includes all of your personal belongings, including estimated values. You can create a simple list on paper, take pictures and video, or use a home inventory app.
