Editor’s Take
Upstart uses a proprietary underwriting system that looks at factors beyond just your credit score to approve you for personal loans. This feature could make debt consolidation loans accessible to borrowers with below-average credit.
Why We Like It
Upstart can provide loan funding within 24 hours and can even send money directly to credit card issuers, saving you time and effort.
What We Don’t Like
Upstart doesn’t accept co-signers or co-borrowers, and origination fees can be up to 12%. Additionally, only two loan terms are available—three- or five-years.
Who It’s Best For
Upstart is an excellent option for young adults and other borrowers with limited credit history, since it reviews additional financial variables and patterns to make lending decisions.
Pros & Cons
No prepayment penalty
Flexible qualifying criteria
High origination fees
Only two repayment terms
Co-signers and co-borrowers not accepted

Editor’s Take
Avant was founded in 2012 to serve middle-income consumers who need to borrow money for emergencies, home improvement, debt consolidation and more.
Why We Like It
We like that Avant may provide loan funding as soon as the next business day. Avant also has accessible customer service, with support available as late as 10 p.m. CT on weekdays and 8 p.m. CT on weekends.
What We Don’t Like
Avant charges origination fees of up to 9.99%. Unlike other lenders, Avant doesn’t offer the option to pay your creditors directly.
Who It’s Best For
Avant may be a great choice for borrowers who want the option to reach their online lender by phone with questions during the week or on weekends.
Pros & Cons
Next-day funding possible
Low minimum credit score requirement
Mobile app and online portal
Administrative fee up to 9.99%

Editor’s Take
OppLoans positions itself as an alternative to high-cost payday loans; however, its interest rates are also high. For this lender to make financial sense for debt consolidation, the rate you obtain must be lower than what you’re currently paying on your existing debt.
Why We Like It
We love that applying for OppLoans doesn’t impact your credit score. Loans are also structured with installment payments and terms ranging from 9 to 18 months.
What We Don’t Like
Interest rates are high for this loan. In comparison, interest rates for the most competitive personal loans cap at 36% APR. Be sure to have a clear understanding of costs before borrowing.
Who It’s Best For
OppLoans is best for borrowers who want to consolidate a small debt balance that has a very high interest rate, since loan amounts cap up to $4,000.
Pros & Cons
No prepayment penalty fees
No credit score minimum
No origination fee
High interest rates
Co-signers and co-borrowers not permitted

Editor’s Take
Personify is a lender that serves borrowers who have trouble qualifying for loans through other lenders. Personify offers loans with fixed payments, but the rates are high.
Why We Like It
We like that loan terms range from one to four years, which can provide you with an extended period to repay your debt. Active borrowers also get access to a free FICO Score, which can be a helpful tool when working to build or rebuild credit.
What We Don’t Like
Personify charges a 5% origination fee to process your loan.
Who It’s Best For
Personify loans are best for borrowers working on building or rebuilding credit because FICO Score monitoring can help you keep track of credit score growth.
Pros & Cons
Next-day funding possible
Free FICO Scores
High interest rates
Co-signers not accepted
No direct pay to creditors

Credit Score You Need To Get a Debt Consolidation Loan
The minimum credit score you need to get a debt consolidation loan may be as low as 300, but there’s a catch. Costs almost always increase the lower your credit score is.
Interest Rates for Bad Credit Debt Consolidation Loans
Often, debt consolidation loans are personal loans, and interest rates on personal loans for bad credit can range from 100% to a whopping 200% APR.
That’s why it’s important to review offers from multiple lenders and consider waiting to improve your credit before applying for a loan, even if you’re facing financial hardship.
Consolidating debt with a high-interest loan can make payments unmanageable, potentially exacerbating an already challenging debt problem.
Typical Debt Consolidation Loan Fees
Aside from interest rates, lenders may charge upfront and miscellaneous fees throughout the loan term, including the following:
Origination fees: An origination fee is a loan processing fee that might cost up to 12% of the loan amount.
Prepayment penalty fees: Most lenders don’t charge penalties if you pay a personal loan off early, but it’s still worth checking the fine print to see if you’ll incur a fee for eliminating your balance ahead of schedule.
Late payment and returned payment fees: If you pay late, lenders may charge a fee. If you make a payment that’s returned as unpaid because your bank account has insufficient funds, the lender may also charge a fee, and your bank may charge your bank account a fee as well.
Types of Lenders That Offer Bad Credit Loans
Borrowers may be able to find loans for bad credit at the following lenders:
Credit unions: Credit unions may offer affordable rates to members who don’t have strong credit.
Online lenders: Online lenders may have less stringent eligibility requirements than traditional banks. Plus, online alternative lenders may look at factors beyond just your credit—like your banking history and employment—to approve you for a loan.
How To Compare Debt Consolidation Loans
Below are factors to compare when shopping for a debt consolidation loan with bad credit:
Review interest rates: Lenders typically use annual percentage rates (APRs) to represent the interest rate on loans. Rates for the best personal loans usually cap at 36%, but rates can exceed 100% APR for borrowers with low credit scores.
Watch out for fees: Compare extra costs, including origination fees, late fees and returned check fees to see where you’ll get the best deal.
Compare loan term lengths: Consider the different costs associated with loan terms. Long repayment terms usually will lower your monthly payment, but can increase your long-term costs because you’ll be paying more interest over time.
Look for rate discounts: Some lenders offer APR discounts if you sign up for autopay, or if you use your loan to pay off debt directly. Interest rate discounts could potentially reduce your monthly payments and long-term costs.
Check for direct-pay features: Certain lenders can send loan funds directly to your creditors to pay off existing balances, which can save you a step.
How To Get a Debt Consolidation Loan With Bad Credit
Below are ways to qualify for a loan with bad credit.
Increase your income. Income is one of many factors besides credit that lenders consider during loan approval. If you can take on side hustles or explore alternative income streams, it may help you get approved and secure a higher loan amount.
Shop around. Shopping with two or three lenders is the best way to compare interest rates and terms to find the most affordable loan you can qualify for.
Apply with a co-signer or co-applicant. Some lenders allow you to apply with a co-signer or co-applicant, and applying with someone who has good credit could improve your approval odds. A co-signer is someone who promises to repay your loan if you don’t, but isn’t entitled to the funds. A co-applicant applies with you and is entitled to loan proceeds.
Prequalify. Some lenders may allow you to prequalify with a soft credit check, which won’t affect your credit score. This way, you can get personalized loan offers and see if you qualify before agreeing to a hard credit check.
Ways Debt Consolidation Impacts Your Credit
Debt consolidations may improve your credit or hurt your credit, depending on the circumstances. Here are ways consolidation can impact your credit history.
WAYS IT CAN HELP CREDIT
WAYS IT CAN HURT CREDIT
1. Paying off credit cards with a consolidation loan could lower your credit utilization ratio and increase your score
1. Loan applications may involve a hard credit inquiry, which may dock your score a few points
2. A lower interest rate could help you pay off debt faster, and debt elimination can be good for your score
2. Not making loan payments on a new loan can result in delinquent credit report records
3. Making on-time loan payments can be positive for your payment history, which may boost your score
3. If you continue using credit cards after using a consolidation loan, your credit usage can increase your overall debt load again

Alternatives to Consolidating Debt With Bad Credit
A debt consolidation is just one way to manage debt with bad credit. Below are other options that could help you restructure your debt to make payments manageable.
Debt management plans (DMPs): Nonprofit agencies may offer DMPs that provide debt coaching and a debt repayment strategy. Your counselor may also help you negotiate lower debt costs while managing your repayment process.
Creditor payment plans or relief: You may be able to negotiate payment arrangements, interest rate reductions or payment pauses directly with your creditors. Consider contacting your credit card company or lenders to explore the options they may offer to help you manage your payments instead of consolidating your debt.
Debt settlements: A debt settlement is the process of negotiating a lump-sum payment to eliminate a debt balance. Sometimes, creditors may accept a lesser amount to get your debt off their books if you are severely delinquent. However, note that nonpayment and settlements can be harmful to your credit score.
Bankruptcy: If debt has become unmanageable because of your income, filing for bankruptcy may be an option. Speaking with a bankruptcy attorney is the best way to find out whether bankruptcy makes sense for you.
Methodology
We reviewed 35 popular lenders based on 20 data points in the categories of loan details, loan costs, eligibility and accessibility, customer experience and the application process. We chose the best lenders based on the weighting assigned to each category:
Loan cost. 32%
Eligibility and accessibility. 21%
Loan details. 20%
Customer experience. 16%
Direct payment to creditors. 15%
Application process. 11%
Within each category, we also considered several characteristics, including available loan amounts, repayment terms, APR ranges and applicable fees. We also looked at minimum credit score requirements, whether each lender accepts co-signers or joint applications and the geographic availability of the lender. Finally, we evaluated the availability of each provider’s customer support team.
Where appropriate, we awarded partial points depending on how well a lender met each criterion.

The Forbes Advisor editorial team is independent and objective. To help support our reporting work, and to continue our ability to provide this content for free to our readers, we receive compensation from the companies that advertise on the Forbes Advisor site. This compensation comes from two main sources. First, we provide paid placements to advertisers to present their offers. The compensation we receive for those placements affects how and where advertisers' offers appear on the site.
This site does not include all companies or products available within the market.
Second, we also include links to advertisers' offers in some of our articles; these “affiliate links” may generate income for our site when you click on them. The compensation we receive from advertisers does not influence the recommendations or advice our editorial team provides in our articles or otherwise impact any of the editorial content on Forbes Advisor. While we work hard to provide accurate and up to date information that we think you will find relevant, Forbes Advisor does not and cannot guarantee that any information provided is complete and makes no representations or warranties in connection thereto, nor to the accuracy or applicability thereof. Here is a list of our partners who offer products that we have affiliate links for.
