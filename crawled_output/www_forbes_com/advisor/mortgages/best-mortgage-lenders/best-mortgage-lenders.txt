Editor's Take
New American Funding (NAF) is one of the country’s largest direct mortgage lenders and is committed to working with underserved borrowers and borrowers with unique income and credit situations. It offers a variety of home loan options, a comprehensive online learning center, fast closing times and customizable terms through its proprietary I CAN Mortgage.
Why We Like It
In addition to working with self-employed borrowers and those with lower credit scores, NAF is openly committed to improving access to homeownership for underserved borrowers.
Why We Don’t Like It

Editor's Take
Bank of America Mortgage stands out for its hybrid online and in-person presence. Customers can visit one of the bank’s 4,300 financial centers to apply for a mortgage or visit its website. Bank of America’s Digital Mortgage Experience provides borrowers with online applications, electronic signatures for documents and online rate locks. If they need assistance, borrowers can also chat with a lending specialist online.
Why We Like It
Bank of America is the second-largest bank in the U.S. and offers mortgages nationwide. It’s a convenient choice for many borrowers, with branches in 38 states and Washington, D.C.
What We Don’t Like
Despite its national presence, Bank of America doesn’t offer USDA loans. It can also take up to 10 business days to receive preapproval letters.

Editor's Take
Rocket Mortgage is an online mortgage lender with a large offering of purchase and refinance home loans.
Why We Like It
We picked Rocket Mortgage for its flexible borrowing options. For example, the lender’s YOURgage home loan allows borrowers to choose between a loan term of eight to 29 years. The company also offers One+ By Rocket Mortgage, a low-down-payment loan. With this option, borrowers only need to put down 1% and Rocket Mortgage will cover an additional 2%.
What We Don’t Like
According to our research, Rocket Mortgage interest rates tend to run higher than the national average. In addition, it can take 30 to 45 days to close a purchase loan.
Who It’s Best For
Rocket Mortgage  is best for borrowers who want flexible loan terms and a fully digital mortgage experience.
Pros & Cons
In addition to standard 30- and 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, flexible terms from eight to 29 years are available
Offers a completely digital mortgage experience
Widely available customer service hours

Doesn’t offer home equity lines of credit (HELOCs)
Doesn’t offer land loans or loans to purchase foreclosures

Editor's Take
Rate offers mortgages with terms ideal for first-time home buyers. Its credit requirements are reasonable, and some of its mortgages may require only 1% down. These features can benefit younger or new home buyers with limited cash reserves and shorter credit history.
Why We Like It
Rate operates in all 50 states and Washington, D.C., and typically offers lower-than-average interest rates. The lender also offers a same-day mortgage approval option with closing in as little as 10 days for borrowers in certain states. Plus, it charges no lender fees for VA loans.
What We Don’t Like
Rate’s same-day mortgage approval option is only available in certain states, and self-employed workers may not be eligible.
Who It’s Best ForRate  is best for first-time home buyers because it has low minimum credit score and down payment requirements. If you have limited or damaged credit, Rate may even use alternative data, such as your rent and utility payments, to determine loan eligibility.
Pros & Cons
Operates in all 50 states
Displays current rates online
No lender fees for VA loan borrowers
Slower preapproval times for some borrowers in certain states
Lender Details

Editor's Take
Northpointe Bank offers a streamlined customer experience with its application process and its one-stop home lending tool, providing ongoing support to its borrowers through its online servicing platform.
Why We Like It
Northpointe Bank offers a wide range of loan products, including conventional loans, government-backed loans, non-QM loans, home equity loans and special loan options.
Why We Don’t Like It
Though it operates in all 50 states and Washington, D.C., Northpointe Bank only has brick-and-mortar branches in 22 states, which is a drawback for borrowers seeking an in-person experience.
Who It’s Best For
Northpointe Bank’s  mortgages are best for borrowers who want a simplified and streamlined digital loan application process with many loan options.
Pros & Cons
Low- and no-down-payment loan options
Online preapproval

Editor's Take
Chase Mortgage is one of the nation’s largest mortgage lenders and features branches all over the country. The bank offers its existing customers access to reduced processing fees and lower rates. It also offers home-buying grants and an on-time closing guarantee.
Why We Like It
Existing Chase customers can receive lower interest rates, up to 0.25%, if they have at least $500,000 in deposits and/or investments. Chase also offers rate discounts to its mortgage customers for new deposits and investments brought to Chase.
What We Don’t Like
Chase’s mortgage discounts only apply to existing customers. Also, some of its mortgage options aren’t available in every state, and its closing guarantee is only available for select loans.
Who It’s Best For
Chase home loans  are best for existing customers who can qualify for relationship discounts.
Pros & Cons
Offers low-down-payment mortgages
Flexible credit and income requirements for some loans
Discounts for Chase customers and mortgage borrowers
Chase’s Closing Guarantee promises $5,000 to borrowers if the closing date is missed

Current Conventional Mortgage Rates
The rates shown here are sourced from the Mortgage Research Center (MRC), which uses standardized parameters—$315,000 for conforming loans and $850,000 for nonconforming loans—when determining rates. These daily rates are calculated assuming a minimum credit score of 740, an 80% loan-to-value (LTV) ratio and a rate lock period ranging from 30 to 60 days.
Mortgage Rate Trends Over Time
Understanding mortgage rate trends over time is essential for prospective buyers and current homeowners. Mortgage rates are affected by a variety of factors, including Federal Reserve policies and economic conditions like inflation. By analyzing historical trends, you can gain valuable insight into rate fluctuations and make more informed financial decisions when buying or refinancing a home.

Types of Mortgages
There are six common types of mortgages you can use to buy a home. These include conventional, jumbo and nonqualified mortgages (non-QM), as well as government-backed loans from the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).
1. Conventional Mortgage
Conventional mortgages are the most common mortgage type. These loans aren’t insured by any government agencies but are instead funded by traditional banks, mortgage finance companies and credit unions. Conventional mortgages are often more difficult to qualify for than government-backed mortgages (like an FHA or USDA loan), but they typically cost less.
2. FHA Loan
FHA loans are backed by the FHA and issued by approved lenders. They’re intended for home buyers with low income or those unable to qualify for a conventional loan. FHA loans have less strict qualifications than conventional loans. Borrowers with a credit score of at least 580 can qualify with a down payment as low as 3.5%. If you put down at least 10%, you can qualify with a credit score as low as 500. However, depending on the size of your down payment amount, you’ll be required to pay mortgage insurance premiums for 11 years or the entire life of the loan.
3. VA Loan
If you’re an active-duty service member or a veteran of the U.S. Armed Forces (or spouse of one), you might qualify for a VA-backed mortgage. And if you still have your full entitlement, there won’t be a VA home loan limit, so you won’t have to make a down payment. Those with remaining entitlement must abide by VA home loan limits. Keep in mind that the VA home loan limit refers to the amount the VA will pay back to the lender if you default on the mortgage. The VA doesn’t have a borrowing limit on home purchases. Like FHA loans, the VA doesn’t issue mortgages directly. Instead, you’ll need to work with an approved VA mortgage lender.
4. Jumbo Mortgage
A jumbo mortgage is a loan that exceeds the lending limits set by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) for single-family homes. They’re used to buy more expensive homes and are often reserved for borrowers with strong finances and high credit scores. You’ll typically need to pay a larger down payment with a jumbo loan, too. The FHFA limit for 2025 is $806,500, meaning you can use a jumbo loan to purchase a home worth more than that in many parts of the country. In high-cost areas, the FHFA limit is $1,209,750.
5. Non-QM Loan
A nonqualified mortgage, or non-QM loan, is intended for self-employed buyers or those with unique financial profiles. Non-QM mortgages have more flexible credit and income requirements than typical qualified mortgages.
6. USDA Loan
USDA loans are intended for low- to moderate-income buyers in rural areas designated as eligible by the USDA. These loans don’t require a down payment or private mortgage insurance, but you have to pay a one-time upfront guarantee fee and a recurring annual fee to cover the loan costs.
How To Get a Mortgage
Buying a home is one of the biggest financial decisions you’ll make in your lifetime. Before you apply, take action and follow these five steps:
Look at your credit. Before applying, comb through your credit report and look for errors you can fix. Keep in mind that conventional mortgages usually require a minimum 620 credit score, while government-backed loans have lower score requirements.
Pay down debts. Lenders consider how much debt you already have relative to your income. This is your debt-to-income (DTI) ratio. Paying down existing debt can reduce your DTI ratio, which can increase your approval odds and potentially get you a better rate.
Prepare paperwork. When you apply for a mortgage, the lender requires copies of some financial documents. Make sure to have your W-2s, tax returns, recent pay stubs and bank statements ready.
Shop around. Don’t settle for the first mortgage lender you find. Shopping around and comparing lenders could save you money in the form of a better rate or lower fees.
Get preapproved. Having a mortgage preapproval can show buyers that you’re motivated to buy and how much you can afford. Consider getting mortgage preapprovals from several lenders before home shopping and submitting offers.
How To Choose the Best Mortgage Lender for You
You don’t have to go with the first lender you find. Before applying for a mortgage, compare several lenders to find the best offer for your money. Shopping around can help you find a lender offering the best rates and terms for your financial needs. First, consider our recommendations and make a short list of lenders offering the features you’re looking for. For many borrowers, the most important features of a lender to consider are:
Mortgage rates
Loan types
Closing costs and other fees
Credit score requirements
Customer service

Is 2025 a Good Time for a Mortgage?
Many experts say that the housing market is impossible to time and that the best time to buy a house is when you need one. But because this is the largest purchase that most people make in their lifetime, it’s crucial to be on a solid financial footing before buying. If you’re being cautious about timing, monitoring the housing market may help you determine what financial position you should be in before buying. Check out Forbes Advisor’s Housing Market Predictions and Mortgage Rates Forecast for expert analysis of the market and rates.
Methodology
Forbes Advisor graded the best mortgage lenders based on features that have a meaningful impact on the cost of a mortgage and a borrower’s experience, including interest rates, loan options, accessibility, closing time and customer service. We award bonus points if a lender offers a specialty mortgage product, rate discount or considers alternative credit data when determining loan eligibility. Our scoring method is broken down as follows:
Interest rate. 20%
Accessibility. 20%
Customer service experience. 20%
Loan options. 15%
Time to close. 15%
Loan minimums. 10%
Bonus points. Up to 5% of the total score
We chose to focus on these core elements to bring forward lenders that offer the most competitive rates while also providing a satisfactory customer experience accessible to borrowers of all financial backgrounds. We believe this scoring system best reflects consumers’ top priorities when comparison shopping for mortgage lenders.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
How do I get the best mortgage rate?
Getting your credit as strong as possible is the best way to get a lower mortgage rate. Start by checking your credit score and addressing any problems. It also helps to pay down large debts and maintain on-time payments. Continue to save as much as possible for a down payment because the more you save, the less you have to borrow. Also, check mortgage rates regularly and shop around for lenders.
How much house can I afford?
To find out how much house you can afford, you’ll need to determine your budget. Consider your monthly earnings and spending to see where your money goes. Generally, spend no more than 30% of your gross monthly income on your mortgage. That should also include taxes, insurance and applicable HOA fees. Forbes Advisor’s affordability calculator can help you take the guesswork out of how much you should spend on a house.
What happens after you've paid off your mortgage?
After you’ve paid off your mortgage, the lender will record a document to release the lien on your property. The mortgage lender will also send you a notice confirming that the mortgage is paid off, as well as a check for remaining escrow funds. Once your mortgage is paid off, you won’t be able to deduct mortgage interest payments on your taxes, and you’ll need to pay your property taxes directly.
How much money do you need for a down payment?
Typically, you need between 3% and 20% of the purchase price as a down payment on a house. This amount depends on the loan program, as some government-backed loans come with 0% down payments. According to the Mortgage Research Center, the average down payment for first-time home buyers was 9% in 2024. Lenders typically require private mortgage insurance for down payments less than 20% on conventional mortgages.
Which is better for a mortgage: a bank, credit union or lender?
Choosing a traditional bank, credit union or mortgage lender depends on your financial situation and personal preferences. Credit unions often offer lower rates and fees than banks, but membership is required. However, a credit union could be a good fit if a community-oriented experience is a top priority. Meanwhile, banks often offer customer loyalty perks like rate discounts and closing cost credit but usually have stricter lending criteria and fewer loan options. Mortgage lenders (nonbank lenders) specialize in mortgages and home loans, often providing more flexible credit standards, a wider variety of loan types and a faster lending process. However, they don’t offer other financial services so if you want a one-stop financial institution, a bank or credit union could be the better choice.
What is the easiest mortgage loan to get?
The easiest mortgage to get ultimately depends on your individual circumstances. That said, FHA loans are a popular choice because of their low credit score and down payment requirements. Depending on your eligibility, VA loans for veterans and USDA loans for rural areas also come with more lenient requirements than many mortgage options.
