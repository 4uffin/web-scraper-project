Refinancing gives you the opportunity to lower your rate or shorten the lifespan of your mortgage, allowing you to save on interest and repay the loan faster. Regardless of why you want to refinance, it’s important to shop around for lenders that offer the best terms and customer support.

Editor's Take
Flagstar Bank Mortgage saves time on closing day with its free hybrid eClose solution, which lets borrowers complete most of the final paperwork on their mobile device or computer in advance. Borrowers can also opt for a traditional closing at a settlement agent’s office or a Flagstar branch.
Why We Like It
You can start the mortgage refinancing process online nationwide with weekend phone support. Homeowners can also remotely connect with a local loan advisor from a nearby Flagstar branch without scheduling an in-person appointment.
What We Don’t Like
Flagstar has branch locations in only nine states, restricting accessibility to local loan officers who can help navigate complex situations and minimize underwriting delays.
Who It’s Best For
Flagstar refinance mortgages are best for homeowners who want a streamlined closing experience for accelerated processing.
Pros & Cons
Offers a wide variety of mortgage types, including low down payment loans and construction loans
Offers free hybrid eClose solution, allowing borrowers to do most of the closing in advance on their mobile device or computer
No minimum loan amount for its conventional and government loan products
Doesn’t allow borrowers to submit a complete application or lock rates online
Borrowers can’t close entirely online
Only offers down payment assistance in some areas of the country

Editor's Take
SoFi Mortgage offers online prequalification within minutes to quickly compare personalized rates for mortgage refinances, home equity loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs). Additionally, many applications close within 30 days, and the lender backs up its underwriting speeds with an on-time closing guarantee worth up to $10,000.
Why We Like It
It’s possible to get rate locks of up to 45 days on SoFi mortgage refinance applications, and SoFi home loan specialists are available by phone or live chat on weekdays. Existing SoFi members also can be eligible for up to $500 in home loan processing fee discounts.
What We Don’t Like
SoFi mortgage refinances are currently unavailable in Hawaii and New York. Additionally, SoFi doesn’t offer fully remote closings, but borrowers can opt for hybrid closings to sign most documents electronically ahead of the closing date.
Who It’s Best For
SoFi refinance mortgages are best for an online application experience with generous support options and a robust on-time closing guarantee.
Pros & Cons
Fast preapproval time
Fully digital application process
Doesn’t offer USDA loans or reverse mortgages

Further, you can apply online nationwide or work with a local loan officer in 28 states and Washington, D.C. It also requires no private mortgage insurance for loan amounts of up to $1 million.
What We Don’t LikeMost PNC Bank branches are primarily in the eastern U.S. These limitations deter medical professionals who seek in-person help yet don’t live near a local branch.
Who It’s Best ForPNC Bank refinance mortgages are best for medical professional homeowners needing specialized financing.

Editor's Take
Rocket Mortgage offers personalizable loan terms as short as eight years through its Yourgage program to minimize your lifetime borrowing costs. Additionally, borrowers can still opt for traditional repayment terms of up to 30 years to secure a smaller monthly payment through a conventional, jumbo, FHA or VA refinance.
Why We Like ItRocket Mortgage’s digital application experience includes an immediate follow-up call from lending specialists who are available seven days a week. This conversation helps you quickly compare the best loan options for your refinancing goals, which may include home equity loans instead of a cash-out refinance.
What We Don’t LikeRocket Mortgage doesn’t offer HELOCs, which provide the flexibility of making on-demand withdrawals. As a result, cash-out refinance and home equity loans require a lump-sum disbursement at closing and a potentially higher minimum payment.
Who It’s Best ForRocket Mortgage is best for homeowners wanting access to an array of short-term and long-term mortgage refinance options to balance an affordable monthly payment with lifetime interest costs.
Pros & Cons
Flexible-term mortgages are available, from eight to 29 years; this is in addition to the standard 30-year and 15-year fixed-rate mortgage options
Offers a completely digital mortgage experience
Customer service hours are extensive
Doesn’t offer USDA loans
Doesn’t offer HELOCs
Doesn’t offer land loans or loans to purchase foreclosures
Lender Details
How to apply
Borrowers can apply online. Phone support is available Monday through Friday, 5 a.m. to 5 p.m. PT. Chat support is available from 5 a.m. to 5 p.m. PT, seven days a week. The lender can preapprove loans within eight minutes.
Speed
As of February 2024, the closing process for a mortgage refinance at Rocket Mortgage averages 21 days.
Eligibility
Minimum credit score of 580 for FHA and VA loans, 620 for conventional mortgages and 680 for jumbo loans
Minimum down payment of 0% for VA loans, 3% for some conventional loans and 3.5% for FHA loans
Alternative credit data, such as rent and utility payments, is accepted
Loan types
Rocket Mortgage’s product line includes fixed and adjustable-rate mortgages, conventional, jumbo, FHA and VA loans. It also offers its own conventional loan, YOURgage, a custom-term, fixed-rate mortgage. Finally, its FHA streamline refinance loan allows existing FHA borrowers to refinance at a lower rate with less paperwork and no appraisal required. The lender offers home equity loans, but it doesn’t offer USDA loans or HELOCs.

Editor's Take
Navy Federal Credit Union Mortgage offers a $1,000 rate-match guarantee when competing lenders provide a better rate on purchase and refinance first mortgages.

Tips for Comparing Best Mortgage Lenders for Refinancing
When comparing the best mortgage refinance lenders, consider and compare the following factors:
Interest rates and annual percentage rates (APRs)
Interest rates influence your monthly payment, whereas APRs include all of the costs associated with the loan, such as mortgage insurance and origination fees. APRs are generally higher and can help you more easily compare the total cost of the loan between different lenders.
Lender fees and discounts
Closing costs can vary by lender, as some may offer ways to waive or reduce the fees. Before shopping for a refinance loan, ask your current lender if it waives any refinancing fees for existing customers.
Loan options
Lenders offering multiple mortgage refinance options make it easier to find the financing terms you need. For example, a specialty program might be a better fit than a traditional refinance or cash-out refinance, depending on your situation.
Customer service quality
The responsiveness of a lender’s loan agent or customer service team can be a deciding factor. A lender that offers quality support—be it over the phone or in person—might be your best choice as this can indicate a well-run company and stress-free underwriting process.
Time to close
It may take longer for certain lenders to close on your refinance application. Factors such as current application volume and the loan type play a part. Some lenders offer on-time closing guarantees with financial incentives if there’s a lender-related delay.
Current Mortgage Refinance Rates
Published rates aren’t guaranteed. The specific rate you’re offered can depend on factors such as your credit score, the mortgage term and whether you’re cashing out equity at closing.
How Does Refinancing a Mortgage Work?
Refinancing your mortgage means you’re taking out a new home loan, usually at a lower interest rate or shorter term—or both—to pay off your existing loan. You can also do a cash-out refinance, which allows you to access the equity you’ve built up in your home. The cash-out refinancing process is similar to traditional refinancing; the only difference is that you’ll replace your current loan with a new one and receive the difference—your equity—as a lump sum cash payment. You usually need at least 20% equity in your home to be eligible.
When Should You Refinance Your Mortgage?
You should consider refinancing your mortgage if at least one of the following criteria is true:
It allows you to lower your monthly mortgage payment by increasing the length of your loan term.
You’ll receive a lower interest than you currently have and reduce your costs over the long term.
You can refinance into a shorter term to pay off your house faster, though monthly costs will be higher.
You can get rid of mortgage insurance with the help of a refinance.
You can tap into necessary equity you've built.

A few things to keep in mind, aside from interest rates, is that the impact of credit scores in relation to obtaining lower rates can often be overlooked until the time of application. In addition, adding any new debts before the application can also hurt credit scores or increase debt-to-income ratios.
A best practice would be requesting a soft credit pull first to ensure credit rating is at the highest point, and if minor maintenance could be done to achieve a higher credit rating, resulting in a lower interest rate and reduced costs.

When a homeowner is looking to refinance their home loan, they need to assess their needs. If they have a seasoned loan officer helping them, the loan officer can help them do this.
As rates come down, there are many options for the customer to consider. They can look at consolidating debt with a cash-out refinance as consumer debt is at an all-time high. They could also use a cash-out refinance to make home improvements as HELOC and fixed-rate second mortgage rates are starting to increase and might not be the best option.
There are a lot of consumers who also bought homes over the last few years who may have an opportunity to lower their interest rate with a rate and term refinance as rates start to trend down.
The best advice for a consumer is to assess what is the best option for them and find a good lender that can help them with all their different options.

How To Refinance Your Mortgage
The mortgage refinancing process shares many similarities with what you experienced when obtaining your purchase mortgage. However, it’s often easier than securing an initial mortgage as you already own the home and presumably have equity. Here are the key steps you can expect when refinancing a mortgage:
Evaluate your circumstances. As with your original mortgage, your lender will require specific criteria to assess your eligibility to refinance, including your level of home equity and property’s current value, a record of your mortgage payments and financial situation such as your employment status, income and liabilities other than your current mortgage. It's crucial to note that for a refinance done within the first year of the purchase date, the value is based on the purchase price, even if the appraisal is higher.
Review your credit score. If your credit history has taken a hit since acquiring your original mortgage, you may not qualify for the most attractive refinance rates, so you may want to take steps to lift your credit score before refinancing. It's also a good idea to look for a lender that only requires a soft credit check for preapproval. This lets you see what offers you may be eligible for without impacting your credit score.
Gather key documents. As with your original mortgage, lenders require you to include financial information with your application, such as W-2 or 1099 forms, tax returns, bank and investment account statements, legal photo identification, proof of residency documentation, and other personal information and supporting documents.
Shop lenders. Once you’re clear on your situation, consult with at least several lenders to compare rates and fees for the best deal. Besides helping you determine the best deal, comparing these options with your current mortgage can help you decide if refinancing makes financial sense. Also, if you see a great rate, ask your lender whether locking in the rate is a good idea and if there’s an associated fee.
Determine potential savings. Once you settle on a lender and the most attractive refinancing terms for your situation, use a mortgage refinance calculator to determine the savings you’ll receive in the long run versus the upfront costs to refinance to confirm refinancing is a wise financial move.
Complete an application. Submit documents for the underwriting process, and expect your lender to order a professional refinance appraisal to verify your home’s current market value.
Close the refinance loan. Your lender will provide a form listing the final details of your loan for review at least three business days before closing. On closing day, expect to read over and sign a few final legal documents and pay any closing costs not folded into the loan. Borrowers typically have a three-day grace period following closing, also known as the right to rescission, to cancel the refinance. Those who get a cash-out refinance can expect to receive funds a few days after the rescission period expires.
Different Types of Mortgage Refinancing
Lenders offer several mortgage refinance options to lower your interest rate, reduce your monthly payment or tap your home equity.
Rate-and-Term Refinance
A traditional mortgage refinance, also known as a rate-and-term refinance, replaces your existing interest rate and repayment term to calculate your new monthly payment without borrowing home equity. Extending the repayment period creates smaller monthly payments but may result in more lifetime borrowing costs.
Cash-Out Refinance
A cash-out refinance lets you borrow a portion of your home equity as a one-time cash distribution. While you’ll get a new interest rate, repayment term and monthly payment, cash-out refinance rates tend to be slightly higher than rate-and-term refinancing.
FHA Streamline Refinance
An FHA streamline refinance  is a rate-and-term refinance for existing FHA-insured home loans. Its primary advantages include flexible credit and underwriting requirements, including no home appraisal. However, mortgage insurance premiums still apply.
VA Streamline Refinance
Existing VA-insured home loans can get a VA interest rate reduction refinance loan (IRRRL)—also known as a VA streamline refinance—to swap to a new interest rate and repayment term. You may also consider this option to convert an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) to a fixed interest rate and payment.
VA Cash-Out Refinance
A VA cash-out refinance  allows homeowners to borrow from their home equity. This program is available to existing VA-backed loans and non-VA home loans. A one-time funding fee applies, but its interest rates tend to be lower than a conventional cash-out refinance.
USDA Streamlined Assist
USDA streamlined assist refinance loans allow current USDA direct and guaranteed borrowers to reduce their monthly payment by at least $50. With 12 consecutive monthly payments, no credit review is necessary, and most borrowers won’t need another home appraisal.
No-Closing-Cost Refinance
A no-closing-cost refinance can mean paying no upfront closing costs. Instead, the lender rolls these fees into the loan APR or principal balance, increasing your monthly payment for the life of the loan. This option helps you save money if you plan on moving soon.
Mortgage Refinancing Requirements
The mortgage refinance application process is similar to the purchase process. You’ll need many of the same documents to verify your credit and finances, and most refinance programs require a new appraisal as well. Here’s a closer look at some of the core requirements.
Credit Score
The credit score to refinance a mortgage differs by loan type and lender. Here’s the score you’ll need for most refinance loans:
Conventional refinance. 620
Jumbo refinance. 700
FHA rate-and-term refinance. Refinancing an FHA loan requires a credit score of at least 500, but lenders may ask for a score of 580 or higher.
FHA cash-out refinance. 580 to 620, depending on what you intend to use the loan for.
FHA streamline refinance. Borrowers can submit a non-credit qualifying application that doesn’t require a hard credit check or minimum credit score. However, a credit-qualifying FHA streamline refinance can result in a lower interest rate. To qualify, you’ll need a minimum credit score of 500 or 580, depending on the LTV ratio.
VA loans. The VA doesn’t set a minimum credit score for VA cash-out refinance or VA streamline refinance loans, but lenders may require a score ranging from 580 to 620.
USDA loans. USDA mortgage lenders can require a credit score as high as 640, although streamlined assist refinance loans waive the credit requirements after 12 consecutive on-time payments.
Debt-to-Income Ratio
Lenders generally accept a DTI ratio as high as 50% for conforming loan refinances, although a higher DTI will likely require additional underwriting and reserve requirements. Non-conforming loans, like jumbo loans, may require you to have a DTI of 43% or lower. Lenders often reserve their most competitive rates for borrowers with a DTI below 43%.
Home Equity
Most lenders require having at least 20% home equity before refinancing, which is the equivalent of an 80% LTV ratio. This is a common benchmark as you can waive private mortgage insurance (PMI) with an LTV ratio below 80% and qualify for more competitive rates. Streamline refinance programs don’t have minimum equity requirements, but you’ll continue paying mortgage insurance premiums with FHA and USDA loans.
Minimum Waiting Period
Most lenders require waiting at least six months from the closing date before accepting a mortgage refinance application. This seasoning period applies to conventional, FHA, VA and USDA loans. It allows you time to establish a positive payment history and accrue more equity, potentially helping you qualify for a better interest rate and monthly payment. Certain loans, such as an FHA cash-out refinance, have more stringent waiting periods that can be as long as 12 months and require consecutive on-time payments. Aside from the initial post-closing waiting period, there’s no limit to how many times you can refinance a mortgage.
Alternatives to Mortgage Refinancing
Refinancing an existing mortgage isn’t always the best option and, depending on your situation, may not even be feasible. Luckily, there are several mortgage refinance alternatives that still allow you to tap your home equity or get the money you need for other financial priorities.
Home equity loan. A home equity loan distributes a lump sum of your available equity with a fixed interest rate over a repayment period of 10 to 30 years. Closing costs are lower than a cash-out refinance as your loan amount is smaller.
Home equity line of credit (HELOC). An interest-only HELOC lets you make multiple withdrawals over a period of time, which keeps your upfront borrowing costs low. The best HELOC lenders may even waive the closing costs.
Mortgage recast. Lenders offer mortgage recasting for conventional and jumbo loans. This process involves making a substantial lump sum payment, which results in a lower monthly payment by reamortizing your loan. Your remaining repayment term and interest rate remain intact. Recasting fees are lower than refinance fees, too.
Home equity conversion mortgage (HECM). A home equity conversion mortgage is a reverse mortgage option for seniors that allows them to cash out their equity upfront without selling their house. The FHA administers this program, which has more regulations to protect borrowers than competing programs.
Home equity agreement (HEA). A home equity agreement lets you access a lump sum of your current equity in exchange for a share of future equity appreciation. The borrower requirements and repayment schedule can be more flexible than a home equity loan or HELOC.
Personal loan. An unsecured personal loan doesn’t require collateral to borrow money for debt consolidation, home improvements or major purchases. Your interest rate can be higher than a cash-out refinance, home equity loan or HELOC, but it may be a better option if you have a small equity position or don’t want to replace your current mortgage rate.
0% APR credit card. If you want to use your equity to refinance high-interest credit card debt, a 0% APR credit card lets you make interest-fee payments during the introductory period. Expect to pay a one-time balance transfer fee, but keep in mind that this expense is still less than closing costs on a refinance loan.
Downsize. Selling your home and downsizing or relocating to a cheaper community can require more effort upfront but may improve your quality of life along with your finances. You can use the sale proceeds to pay off debt or save.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
Can I refinance my mortgage with bad credit?
There are several ways for you to refinance your mortgage with bad credit:
Work with your existing lender. If you want to refinance and have bad credit, your first step should be trying to work out a deal with your current lender, even as you get quotes from others. Your lender won’t want to lose your business.
Work with a credit specialist. It’s crucial to find someone who’s realistic about what can and cannot be accomplished and what that timeline will look like.
Check VA refinance program. If you are active-duty military, a veteran or a qualifying spouse, you may be able to refinance with a VA loan. The VA doesn’t have a minimum credit score requirement, although the individual lender might require a score of at least 620.
FHA refinance programs. Another option is to refinance into an FHA loan. Loans insured by the FHA allow borrowers to qualify with scores as low as 500, depending on the program.
Is it better to refinance with your current lender?
If you have a poor credit score, it might be a good idea to refinance with your current lender. As an existing customer, it might allow you more leeway in terms of credit qualifications, especially if you’ve been making all your payments on time.
How long does a mortgage refinance take?
The length of the mortgage refinance process varies by loan and lender. Approval usually takes about 30 to 45 days, but it’s not uncommon for the timeline to extend beyond that range. This timeline may vary depending on where you live.   The time to close depends on several factors, such as your diligence with getting the required documents to your lender and the type of loan you plan to take out. For example, government-backed mortgages can take longer to close than a conventional loan.
Does refinancing hurt your credit?
When you apply for refinancing, your lender will run a hard credit check, resulting in a hard inquiry and temporarily reducing your credit score.   If you plan to submit applications with several lenders, minimize the negative impact on your score by concentrating your loan applications within 45 days so that these can be considered a single inquiry.   Refinancing may also cause a credit score dip—especially with cash-out refinances that reduce your home equity and increase your loan balance—because you are replacing an established loan with a new one.   The good news is that your score will improve over time as you rebuild your credit by paying off your refinance loan.
How Often Can You Refinance?
In theory, you can refinance as often as you like, within the rules established by your mortgage lender. Most have an initial waiting period of six months, and for some, that “seasoning” period may last as long as 12 months.   In practice, however, refinancing is costly—expect to pay anywhere from 2% to 5% of the loan amount in closing costs—and time-consuming. You’ll need to fill out as much paperwork and provide as much documentation as you did when you originally applied for your mortgage. What’s more, your credit score takes a hit every time you apply for credit.   Though you can refinance more than once, frequent refinancing doesn’t usually make good financial sense.
How Much Does It Cost To Refinance a Mortgage?
Refinancing closing costs can run anywhere from 2% to 5% of the loan amount. There are no-closing-cost refinance options, but they generally involve rolling closing costs into the principal balance, which will likely cost more in the long run. The bottom line is that refinancing can be very financially advantageous—but it’s rarely free.
