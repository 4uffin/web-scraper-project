Editor’s Take
Rapid Finance may be the golden ticket to business financing if you have limited or damaged personal credit.
Why We like it
Rapid Finance has no credit score requirement, as long as applicants pass other eligibility criteria, including repayment ability, time in business and annual revenue, among others. In addition to this, we like that Rapid Finance charges no late or prepayment penalty fees.
Why We Don’t Like It
Businesses must make at least $200,000 in annual revenue to qualify for a Rapid Finance loan. Interest rates may also be high compared to other lenders.
Who It’s Best For
Rapid Finance business loans are best for business owners running an established business with reliable revenue streams but who don’t have the credit history to qualify for other loans.
Pros & Cons
Nationwide availability
Funding within hours of approval
Lower revenue requirements than some competitors
Limited loan details available online
Payments automatically deducted
Must be in business at least two years to qualify

Eligibility

Editor’s Take
If you’re looking for competitive interest rates and sufficient loan amounts, TD Bank may be the right choice for your business.
Why We Like It
TD Bank loans have flexible eligibility criteria for a brick-and-mortar institution, making it a good bank loan option for growing businesses with low annual revenue. TD Bank’s lack of origination fees is another advantage for business owners on a tight budget.
Why We Don’t Like It
TD Bank business loans may have prepayment penalty fees if you pay the loan off early, which isn’t ideal if you want to expedite your repayment. What’s more, if you need more than $250,000, you’ll have to apply in person.
Who It’s Best For
TD Bank business loans are best for new business owners with fair credit who are shopping for a competitive interest rate.
Pros & Cons
No origination fee
Low APRs for borrowers who qualify
In-person and online applications
Prepayment penalty fees
Must apply in person for loans over $250,000
Lender details
Eligibility
Minimum credit score: 615

Editor’s Take
Regardless of where you’re business is located, QuickBridge has you covered, offering financing in all 50 states.
Why We like it
QuickBridge accepts low credit scores and provides multiple payment options, including daily, weekly, bi-weekly and monthly terms. It also funds loans within 24 hours of approval.
Why We Don’t Like It
Factor rates starting at 1.11 at QuickBridge may be equivalent to annual percentage rates (APRs) starting at 20%. Since factor rate loan costs are typically bundled into the loan, paying it off early doesn’t usually lower your financing costs. However, QuickBridge may offer an early payoff discount.
Who It’s Best For
QuickBridge is best for borrowers with limited credit. However, borrowers must pay careful attention to fees to ensure payments and long-term costs are manageable.
Pros & Cons
Flexible repayment options
Quick application and fast funding deposited to a bank account
Early payoff discounts
Loan interest may be high
$250,000 minimum annual revenue requirement for small business loans
Only short-term repayment terms are available
Details
Eligibility

Editor’s Take
Many online business loans charge an origination fee, but Bluevine doesn’t, making it an excellent opportunity for cost-conscious borrowers.
Why We Like It
Bluevine is a QuickBooks lending partner, so QuickBook users can apply for Bluevine loans within their QuickBooks profile using accounting data. This could expedite the funding process. What’s more, borrowers can avoid costly fees through Bluevine.
Why We Don’t Like It
APRs on Bluevine term loans may be high for borrowers who don’t have strong credit.
Who It’s Best For
Bluevine term loans are best for QuickBook users and other borrowers with high credit scores looking to avoid loan processing fees.
Pros & Cons
Receive a decision within five minutes and instant funding with a Bluevine business checking account, or receive funds within 24 hours
Lines of credit up to $250,000
Low credit score requirement

Editor’s Take
National Funding is a suitable pick for borrowers who want to avoid carrying debt for a long period since loan terms can be as short as six months.
Why We Like It
National Funding stands out for providing high loan amounts with flexible credit requirements. Loans may also come with customizable daily, weekly or monthly repayment terms. If you repay loans in advance, you could qualify for early payoff discounts.
Why We Don’t Like It
National Funding isn’t as transparent with its interest rates and fees as other lenders. Prospective borrowers must apply first to receive their APR quote.
Who It’s Best For
National Funding short-term business loans are best for borrowers who need money to fill temporary gaps and want the opportunity to choose flexible payment options.
Pros & Cons
Financing up to $500,000
Early payoff discounts
Most loans are funded within 24 hours of approval
Requires daily or weekly payments
Potentially high borrowing costs
Requires minimum gross annual sales of $250,000
Details
Eligibility
Minimum credit score: 600 (575 for equipment financing)
Time in business: Six months

Editor’s Take
OnDeck, funding over 150,000 businesses since 2006, is sound choice for anyone who wants to work with a company that has a longstanding history in the business lending space.
Why We Like It
OnDeck does not require a hard credit check, so you can avoid taking a credit hit when borrowing. It’s also requires only $100,000 in annual revenue.
Why We Don’t Like It
While starting APRs for OnDeck loans are low, the lowest rates are only for the most creditworthy borrowers. The average ARPs for its term loans is 57.9% APR.
Who It’s Best For
OnDeck business term loans are best for established business owners who can qualify for the competitive interest rates.
Pros & Cons
Term loans from $5,000 to $250,000
Lines of credit from $6,000 to $100,000

Editor’s Take
Chase small business loans are a solid option for business owners looking to double down on the bank’s full suite of products and services.
Why We like it
Chase offers interest rate discounts of 0.4% to 1.2% on loans of at least $500,000 if you keep a certain amount on deposit in business banking. It also has no annual revenue requirement as long as you meet credit factors and have enough net income to make payments.
Why We Don’t Like It
Chase small business loans have early repayment penalties when you borrow at least $250,000. There’s also no online application, so you have to apply in person.
Who It’s Best For
Chase small business loans are best for business owners who want to take advantage of Chases full suite of products. Pair Chase loan products with business banking and business credit cards and you could unlock extra perks like rewards points and rate discounts.
Pros & Cons
Terms extend up to five years
No origination fees
Branches in all lower 48 states
Doesn’t disclose credit score requirements
Business must be at least 2 years old

Editor’s Take
Online business owners with low revenue can turn to PayPal business loans to tap into necessary financing.
Why We like it
We like that PayPal business loans charge no late, processing or prepayment penalty fees. Plus, the annual revenue requirement of $33,300 is lower than many other lenders.
Why We Don’t Like It
PayPal’s offers only weekly payments, which may not work for all businesses. Say you receive most client invoice payments at the end of each month. In this case, you could have cashflow trouble keeping up with mid-month payments.
Who It’s Best For
PayPal business loans are best for online businesses less than a year old, especially those that already use PayPal. Existing PayPal business users may be able to speed through the application process.
Pros & Cons
No late fees
Next-day funding possible
Flexible eligibility criteria
Early repayment won’t result in savings
Unclear details on financing charges

Kapitus is a solid choice for businesses owners looking to borrow $1 million or more with low rates and flexible repayment terms.
Why We Like It
We like that Kapitus charges no prepayment penalties and offers low starting interest rates. Plus, applicants may receive as many as six offers through one application to compare before finalizing the deal.
Why We Don’t Like It
Kapitus loan terms are limited to two years, so if you borrow a large sum, you’ll likely have high payments.
Who It’s Best For
Kapitus is best for business owners with good credit and multiple years of business history who need large loan amounts to grow or expand their operations.
Pros & Cons
Large lines of credit up to $750,000

Tips for Comparing Small Business Loans
When in need of financing, follow the tips below to find the right small business loan options to fit your needs:
Check Credit Requirements
While some lenders allow for personal credit scores as low as 600, you typically need a score of at least 670 to get the most competitive rates on business loans. However, some alternative loan options, like invoice factoring, may offer no credit check.
Understand Revenue Criteria
Revenue requirements for loans vary. Lenders generally look for businesses to have at least $100,000 in annual revenue but higher is better.
Review Time in Business Conditions
Some lenders offer startup loans. However, you often must be in operation for at least one year to get a business loan. Some lenders may approve businesses in operation for at least six months.
Check Interest Rates
Bank and credit union annual percentage rates (APRs) can range from 7% to 14%, while online lenders may have rates of 10% to over 100%.
Watch Out for Fees
Term loans may charge upfront origination fees and credit lines may have ongoing draw fees to take into consideration.
Compare Loan Terms and Payment Frequency
Loan term lengths may be a few months or several years long, depending on the loan type and lender. Review multiple term lengths and payment options to determine which best meets your needs.
Review Funding Speeds
While bank loans may offer low rates, online small business loans may have fast loan processing speeds. Review the pros and cons of each option.
Look Into Loan Perks
Consider the extra services each lender provides. For example, some lenders offer loan integration to your accounting platform, making it easier to account for debt and repayments.
Calculate Your Small Business Loan Payments
As you search for the best small business loans for you, use a business loan calculator to understand your monthly costs and the financial responsibility of each loan offer.
Small Business Financing Options
Business funding comes in many sizes, from microloans of a few thousand dollars to large loans of $100,000 or more. Common types of loans for small businesses include:
Term loans: Term loans offer a lump sum that can be ideal for major purchases. Loan terms range from a few months to as long as 10 or 25 years, depending on the loan purpose and where you get the loan from.
Lines of credit: Business lines of credit offer a revolving credit line to borrow against on an ongoing basis during the draw period, which is then repaid during the repayment period. Unlike a term loan, you only owe interest on the amount you draw, not the full credit line.
Equipment financing: Equipment financing is for big-ticket items like vehicles, office equipment or computers. The equipment may serve as collateral to back the loan, which means the lender could repossess the equipment if you default.
Invoice factoring: Invoice factoring is the process of selling unpaid invoices to a factoring company to get a portion of the unpaid amount up front. It typically requires a no credit check, so it could be a viable option for business owners with limited credit.

How To Get a Small Business Loan
Applying for a business loan can feel daunting, especially if it’s your first time. Taking the following steps can help you qualify for the best business loan options:
Review your personal credit. Lenders typically look at your personal credit to qualify you for a loan. Before shopping for a loan, review your credit score and credit report to see where you stand. If needed, improve your score before applying by repaying existing debt.
Build business credit. Although lenders typically prioritize a business owner’s personal credit, businesses that establish good business credit may qualify for better loan terms. When starting from scratch, you can build business credit by opening business trade or credit card accounts and making on-time payments.
Gather financial documents. Lenders use business plans and financial documents like profit and loss statements to measure your business’s financial strength. Collecting these before the application process can speed things up.
Prequalify for loans. Many lenders allow you to prequalify for business financing online. Prequalifying can help you estimate rates and costs to find the best small business loans for you without impacting your credit score.
Choose an offer. Once you have multiple loan offers, review terms and fees to determine the best loan for your goals before completing the full application.
Business Loan Requirements
Minimum qualification requirements vary by lender, but, in general, you’ll typically need to meet the following criteria to get a small business loan:
Credit score of at least 600; 670 for the most competitive rates
Minimum one year in business, with some exceptions
Minimum $100,000 in annual revenue, with some exceptions
Proof of business ownership and licenses
Business plans and financial statements
Loans also typically require a personal guarantee from owners, which means you will be held liable for the loan if your business can’t repay it. The best place to get a business loan may be a bank if you have very strong credit and high annual sales, because traditional banks may offer the most competitive rates. Alternative lenders, like online lenders, can also be an option for startups and business owners who don’t have strong credit, since eligibility criteria may be more flexible.
Documents You Need To Get a Business Loan
While application processes vary, some documents a lender may ask you for include:
Business certificates, licenses and registrations
Business credit reports
Business plans
Deeds to property
Financial statements (e.g., bank statements, income statements, balance sheets)
Partnership agreements
Income tax returns
Other legal documents (e.g., licensing agreements and commercial leases)

Small Business Lending Trends
Here are a few points to note about the current small business loan market.
Uncertainty remains regarding tariffs. A federal appeals court ruling in late August decided the president didn’t have the power to impose tariffs through executive order under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). However, tariffs will remain in effect until October 14 to give the administration time to challenge the decision. In terms of borrowing, tariff hikes on imports could put pressure on business cash flow, impacting capacity to meet debt obligations and qualify for future financing.
Business lending credit standards remain in a chokehold. The quarterly Federal Reserve’s Small Business Lending survey found that business lending credit standards tightened for the fourteenth consecutive quarter in Q1, 2025. Credit quality also declined, and 47% of responding firms who reported a credit quality increase or decrease said that debt-to-income level played a major role.
The prime rate decreased in September. In September, the Fed rate was decreased by 25 basis points to a target range of 4.00%-4.25%. Following the Fed meeting, the prime rate also decreased to 7.25% from 7.5%. Commercial banks may set short-term business rates using the prime rate, which serves as a base rate closely linked to the federal funds rate.
Alternatives to a Small Business Loan
Aside from small business loans, consider the following options to get financial resources for your business.
Merchant cash advances: An advance that you repay with a percentage of future debit or credit card sales. However, factor fees and administrative fees can be expensive.
Credit cards: Business credit cards may offer quick online applications and near-immediate access to funds. However, interest rates can be high and debt on a high-interest card can be hard to pay off if you use it to pay for many expenses.
Crowdfunding: Instead of borrowing money, you could try launching a crowdfunding campaign to raise funding from others. Fundraising can reduce borrowing costs while helping you build a community of loyal supporters.
Personal loans: With a personal loan, only your finances are considered so you don’t have to worry about being in business for a certain amount of time. Before applying, be sure your lender offers personal loans for business use.
Grants and accelerator programs: Depending on your type of business, you may qualify for a grant to cover startup or growth costs. Some organizations also manage accelerator programs where business owners get funding and mentorship.
Methodology
We reviewed 25 popular lenders based on 20 data points in the categories of loan details, loan costs, eligibility and accessibility, customer experience and the application process. We chose the nine best lenders based on the weighting assigned to each category:
Loan cost. 30%
Loan details. 25%
Customer experience. 19%
Eligibility and accessibility. 15%
Application process. 11%
Within each major category, we also considered several characteristics, including available loan amounts, repayment terms and applicable fees. We also looked at minimum credit score and time in business requirements and the geographic availability of the lender. Finally, we evaluated each provider’s customer support tools, borrower perks and features that simplify the borrowing process—like online applications, prequalification options and mobile apps.
Where appropriate, we awarded partial points depending on how well a lender met each criterion.To learn more about how Forbes Advisor rates lenders, and our editorial process, check out our Business Loans Rating Methodology.
