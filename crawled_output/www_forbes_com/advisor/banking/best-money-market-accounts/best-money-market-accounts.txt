Editor's Take
We picked the money market account from Quontic Bank because it has a competitive tiered interest rate structure and comes with a debit card offering access to over 90,000 ATMs nationwide.
Why We Like It
This account requires a relatively low $100 minimum deposit to open the account and charges no monthly maintenance fee.
What We Don’t Like
No physical locations or paper statements means that you must be comfortable with online-only banking.
Best For Large Balances
Those with a pre-existing savings haul will benefit from Quontic’s savings yield, which is among the highest on the market.
Pros & Cons
High yields
Low minimum deposit requirement
Debit card privileges
Extensive ATM network
Customer service available via live chat, email or phone
Customer service isn’t available 24/7
No physical locations
Details
Savers earn a healthy interest rate of 4.25% annual percentage yield, which applies to all balance tiers, identified as $0.01–$4,999.99, $5,000.00–$149,999.99 and balances over $149,999.99 no matter how much money is in your accounts, and interest compounds daily.
You can access your account from more than 90,000 ATMs nationwide, and there’s no limit to the number of transactions you make in a month.
A customer service representative is available Monday through Friday via live chat, email or phone, and you can also use the bank’s highly rated mobile app.
There is no maintenance fee and few other costs involved with the account. You will owe $10 for a returned deposited item and $25 for an outgoing domestic wire transfer.

Editor's Take
We liked NASA Federal Credit Union Premier Money Market because it marries a decent yield, although not among the highest on the market, with good customer service, including a highly rated app and the ability to connect with a customer service representative through live chat. All deposits are NCUA insured up to $250,000 per depositor for each account ownership category.
Why We Like It
NASA Federal Credit Union Premier Money Market account offers good customer service—from its mobile apps to the ability to live chat with its representatives—and doesn’t charge much in the way of fees. Its yield of 1.75%, while not among the highest available, is still relatively competitive.
What We Don’t Like
You’ll need to become a member of the credit union to open an account, and you’ll need at least $10,000 to open an account.
Best For Easy Transfers
NASA Federal Credit Union is a part of Shared Branches, a network of affiliated credit unions that allow customers to visit locations around the country in order to do their banking business.
Pros & Cons
Highly-rated mobile apps
Live chat available
Few fees
Some branch locations
Yield is not top of market
$10,000 minimum deposit requirement
Must become a member to join
Details
You can become a member by joining the National Space Society when you apply for your account.
The Premier Money Market account earns a yield of , though you’ll need to maintain a daily minimum balance of , which is also the amount needed to open the account. Dividends compound and are credited monthly.
You’ll be limited to six transactions a month for automatic transfers taken to cover overages on other accounts, transfers by telephone and ACH transfers made at a predetermined time.
There is no limit on transactions if you use your account to pay for loans, or for transactions made in person or via an ATM.
NASA is a shared branch, meaning it’s part of a co-op of credit unions, which allows you to use an ATM and make deposits or withdrawals. You can use its map tool to find a branch near you.

Editor's Take
We chose First Internet Bank because its money market account offers a competitive yield on all balances. Its monthly fee is waived on balances of $4,000 or more, and emergency funds tend to be large enough to surpass this minimum.
Why We Like It
This full-service online bank also offers competitive checking, savings and CD accounts, so you can do all your banking in one place.
What We Don’t Like
Other money market accounts don’t charge monthly fees, so if your balance might fall below $4,000, it’s best to go with those. Also, this account doesn’t come with an ATM card, which could be a pro or a con depending on your needs.
Best For Online Banking
While there are no branches, you’ll earn a high yield on your savings.
Pros & Cons
Competitive APY
Low initial deposit requirement
All balances earn APY
Full-service banking options
Monthly fee for balances under $4,000
Interest compounded monthly
No check-writing or debit card privileges
No ATM network
Details
First Internet Bank’s Money Market Savings offers a competitive 3.61% APY with a daily balance of $1 million or less or a 4.42% APY with a daily balance above $1 million. There is a $5 monthly maintenance fee, but you can avoid this by keeping an average daily balance of at least $4,000. Customers can open an account for $100, lower than required by some other banks and credit unions.
To get a debit card or checks, you’ll need to open a separate checking account with First Internet Bank. Although there’s no ATM network, the bank does provide up to $10 per month in ATM surcharge rebates.
Interest is compounded and credited monthly. There’s an excess transaction fee of $5 for certain types of transactions beyond six per statement cycle.

Editor's Take
We ranked the Synchrony Money Market Account highly thanks to its combination of low fees and relatively competitive APY. There’s no minimum to open an account, no maintenance fee and you can withdraw your funds fee-free from one of its in-network ATMs. You’ll also receive up to $5 in ATM reimbursements if you were charged by a third-party ATM operator. While it’s 2.25% APY isn’t the highest figure on the market, it is more than most.
Why We Like It
The account is easy to use, charges few fees and reimburses some ATM charges (if you use an ATM outside its network). You can also request checks. The fact that these benefits come with a competitive APY is a nice bonus.
What We Don’t Like
The account’s APY, though, is not among the best available.
Best For First-Time Savers
Young savers benefit from Synchrony’s lack of fees, high yields and no minimum balance.
Pros & Cons
Highly-rated mobile app
No monthly fee
ATM fee reimbursements
Check writing privileges
Can find better yields elsewhere
No physical locations
Details
Synchrony’s money market account offers a competitive 2.00% APY on all balance tiers. While that’s not the highest yield on the market, it is still much higher than the typical money market account.
Even better, there is no $0 and no monthly maintenance fee, making it attractive to new savers looking for an account.
You can access your cash at any ATM with the Plus or Accel logos without paying any fees, and you’ll receive $5 in reimbursements if you’re charged to use an ATM out of network. You can request checks, and you can use your account as often as you’d like without incurring a fee.

Editor's Take
Our experts liked the Northern Bank Direct Money Market Premier Account because it pays a competitive APY on balances up to $250,000 and charges few fees. You can make an unlimited number of withdrawals via ATMs, which you can find with the bank’s map tool.
Why We Like It
Earn a high yield on your savings while having the freedom to make unlimited ATM withdrawals.
What We Don’t Like
You must deposit at least $5,000 to open an account, limiting its usefulness for young savers.
Best For Quick Access
With unlimited ATM withdrawals from fee-fee locations that are in-network, you’ll be able to access your cash when you need it.
Pros & Cons
Competitive APY
No monthly fees
Unlimited ATM withdrawals
Interest compounds monthly, not daily
$5,000 minimum opening deposit required
Details
Northern Bank Direct pays a competitive 3.75% APY on its money market account on balances up to $250,000. For anything more than that, you’ll only receive a yield of 0.25%. Interest compounds and is credited monthly.
You’ll need to deposit at least $5,000 to open an account.
There are no account fees, and you can withdraw cash fee-free from ATMs that are part of the SUM network.
Customer service is available but limited compared to other online banks. You can call Northern Bank Direct during normal business hours Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. ET, and Saturdays from 8:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. ET. You can also send emails, but there is no live chat.

Editor's Take
We ranked Sallie Mae Bank’s money market account highly because savers can pair this competitive MMA with the bank’s SmartyPig savings account. The SmartyPig Account comes with tools to create and track progress toward specific money goals—like an online piggy bank. The bank’s MMA gives consumers a place to earn a high rate on savings they’ve already built, and the SmartyPig Account helps them set and achieve new savings milestones.
Why We Like It
The combination of a high APY with no monthly maintenance fee or minimum deposit requirement makes this account a clear winner.
What We Don’t Like
The bank’s mobile app could be more user-friendly.
Best For Short-Term Savings Goals
Consider Sallie Mae’s MMA if you’re working on building your savings. The savings tools and competitive APY should provide extra motivation.
Pros & Cons
Competitive APY
No monthly fee
No minimum opening deposit requirement
All balances earn APY
Check-writing privileges
No debit card
Poorly rated Sallie Mae Banking mobile app
Details
Sallie Mae Bank’s money market account features a competitive 3.85% APY with no minimum deposit requirement and no monthly maintenance fee. The account doesn’t come with a debit card, but account holders can write checks.
Money market account transfers out of the account to repay loans at Sallie Mae are unlimited.
Interest on Sallie Mae money market accounts is compounded daily and paid monthly.

Editor's Take
Redneck Bank’s Mega Money Market account offers users a high yield on balances up to $100,000, doesn’t charge a monthly maintenance fee and allows users to withdraw cash from ATMs.
Why We Like It
We love that this account offers one of the highest yields on the market without imposing a minimum deposit requirement.
What We Don’t Like
Your APY drops to 0.50% on balances over $100,000, which limits the account’s upside.
Best For No Minimum Deposit
You start earning 4.40% on the first dollars you save. That high rate, though, is limited only to balances up to $100,000.
Pros & Cons
Competitive APY
No deposit requirement
ATM access
No monthly fees
APY drops to 3.85% on high balances
Only six transactions allowed per month
$3 fee for paper statements
Details
Mega Money Market account holders earn 0.50% APY on the first $100,000 they deposit and then 3.85% on each additional dollar. You’ll need to put down at least $500 to open an account, but there’s no minimum balance requirement going forward.
Savers have access to fee-free ATMs, which you can find on Redneck Bank’s website, but you are only allowed to make six free transactions a month. You’ll owe $5 for each additional transaction throughout the billing cycle. You can make 10 online monthly bill pay transactions, before owing $0.50 for each additional one.
There is a $3 fee for paper statements, though no fee for electronic ones, and you’ll owe $25 if your account has been overdrawn for 10 consecutive days.

Editor's Take
CIT Bank’s Money Market Account offers a decent yield of 1.55%, but keeps fees low and allows unlimited transactions for savers.
Why We Like It
We love that the account doesn’t have a monthly maintenance fee and requires just $100 to open an account, while offering an APY of 1.55%.
What We Don’t Like
We wish that the account came with check-writing privileges and an ATM card. You can find higher yields elsewhere.
Best For Financial Security
You’ll receive the standard $250,000 in FDIC insurance per depositor, however, your funds will be held by First Citizens Bank, one of the nation’s largest financial institutions.
Pros & Cons
Decent APY
Low deposit requirement
Unlimited transactions
No monthly fees
Higher yields elsewhere
No check writing privileges or ATM access
$25 overdraft fee
Details
CIT Bank’s money market account offers an APY of 1.55%, which is lower than the top rates available but still much higher than a typical competitor.
The minimum deposit requirement is just $100, and there’s no monthly maintenance fee, making the account very user-friendly for new account holders.
There are no check-writing privileges or ATM access, so avoid this account if you want a money market account that acts more like a checking account. Still, you can make an unlimited number of electronic transactions without incurring a fee.
You won’t be charged for incoming wire transfers, but you will be charged $10 for outgoing wires if your account’s daily average balance is below $25,000 (if your account’s daily balance is over this amount, there is no fee) ) and $25 for an overdraft.

Why We Like It
VirtualBank eMoney Market accounts offer a yield that is close to the top of the market without requiring a big minimum deposit to open an account.
What We Don’t Like
There is a $5 monthly fee, though it can be waived, and you are limited in the number of transactions you can make a month.
Best For Flexible Terms
You’ll earn a high yield across balance tiers, helping you to meet your financial goals.
Pros & Cons

Daily compounding interest
$5 monthly maintenance fee
No check writing privileges
Limited to 6 transactions a month
Details
You’ll earn a yield of

You can open an account with $100, though you will be charged a $5 monthly maintenance fee if your balance falls below that level at least once in a billing cycle.

Current Money Market Rates
Average money market rates are generally much lower than the best money market rates available. The table below compares the average APYs for money market accounts.
Recent News on Money Market Rates
At the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting held on September 17, 2025, Fed Chair Jerome Powell announced that the board voted to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter point, lowering the target range to 4.00%-4.25%. It was the first reduction of the year and came in response to a slower labor market, weaker consumer spending and inflation that remains above the Fed’s 2% target.
Banks are expected to adjust money market rates in the coming weeks and months as rates on MMAs generally mirror policy cuts. Some banks will adjust quickly, while others may hold off depending on how much they want to attract deposits. Online banks, with lower operating costs, may keep offering higher MMA rates longer than large traditional banks.
Pros and Cons of Money Market Accounts
PROS
CONS
Flexibility. Many money market accounts come with checks and debit cards, allowing you to spend your savings, make withdrawals and transfer funds.
Transaction restrictions. Many banks and credit unions impose transaction limits and charge a fee for excess withdrawals.
Interest earnings. Money market accounts earn interest on funds you keep on deposit. These rates often compete with the best high-yield savings accounts.
Interest rates. The rate of interest on a money market account isn’t fixed, meaning it can fluctuate. You won’t know exactly how much you will earn over time.
Safety. MMA funds are insured when held with banks backed by the FDIC or credit unions backed by the NCUA.
Balance requirements. Many money market accounts require high deposits to open and high balances to earn the best rates and avoid monthly fees.

When To Use a Money Market Account
A money market account (MMA) is a financial tool, but its benefits depend on your goals. You can use an MMA to fund an emergency account, for instance. You’ll have access to high yields, while also being able to access your cash (depending on the particular terms and conditions of your account) at an ATM. You can also use an MMA as your main transaction account. It also pays a solid interest rate that is much higher than one offered by even a high-yield checking account. Another option is to reserve an MMA as a savings vehicle for a particular purchase, such as a family vacation or a down payment on a car. With your cash in a separate account from your typical checking and savings, you might be less likely to squander it. In any case, consider the specific terms. MMAs differ in terms of minimum deposit requirements, the number of monthly withdrawals you can earn and the ability to write checks.

In short, yes! In many cases, you can get all of the benefits of a traditional savings account and a higher rate of interest in a money market account. Just make sure the account is FDIC-insured and not an investment money market fund, as that may not be insured. These are great accounts for funds you want liquid, such as an emergency fund.
Lawrence Sprung
Certified Financial Planner (CFP®) and founder of Mitlin Financial, Inc.
I think money market accounts are a great hack for earning interest on what essentially can function as a pseudo-checking account. You have the flexibility of paying directly from it while also earning interest. Although they are not the highest interest-earning accounts out there, they are a nice option for maximizing earnings on dollars needed in the short-term.

MMAs often offer higher interest rates compared to regular savings accounts, [which] can be advantageous if you’re looking to earn more on your savings while still transacting a moderate amount from the account. MMAs typically offer better liquidity than CDs, allowing you to withdraw funds without penalty. This can be beneficial if you need occasional access to your money or need to have some transactions into and out of your account.

How To Choose a Money Market Account
Here’s what to consider when shopping for a money market account:
APY. One of the most important aspects of a money market account is the rate at which it earns interest or dividends. Look for an account that offers a competitive APY while meeting your other needs, such as low fees.
Fees. Watch out for monthly fees, excessive transaction fees and other fees that can eat into your returns.
Minimums. Minimum deposit and balance requirements vary by institution. Generally, lower minimum requirements make it easier to maintain the account. Find an account with minimums that you can afford.
Customer experience. Especially if you’re banking at an institution with limited branch access, make sure the bank or credit union offers customer care representatives that are accessible and responsive to your requests.
Digital banking. Consider the online and mobile banking features you use most often, including the score of a particular bank’s mobile app.
Accessibility. Banks and credit unions vary on how they allow you to withdraw funds from a money market account. Some offer check-writing and debit card privileges. Although the Federal Reserve Board has suspended Regulation D, which restricts the number of transactions a saver can make per cycle from their savings account, each institution has its own policies. Ask about withdrawal options and the excess transaction fee of each institution before you open an account.
Safety. Look for an account insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which provides up to $250,000 in insurance per depositor, per bank, for each account ownership category, in the event of a bank failure. At credit unions, make sure the account is similarly insured by the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA).
Pro Tip
Some money market accounts use a tiered interest rate system, which pays higher interest rates to customers who hold higher balances. Consider the balance you expect to hold, and keep this in mind when searching for an MMA.
How To Open a Money Market Account
You can open a money market account in person or online by following these steps:
Gather the required documentation, such as your Social Security number and proof of identity.
Compare money market accounts from different financial institutions to find the best rates and fees.
Complete the online application process with your chosen financial institution—or visit a branch if online applications aren’t available.
Fund your account via direct deposit, a check or a transfer from an existing account.
Confirm your account is open and in good standing by checking your money market account balance regularly.
Alternatives to Money Market Accounts
Money market accounts are just one savings tool; you may find that others better suit your needs. Here are some trade offs to consider:
Money Market Account vs. Savings Account
Both Money market accounts and savings accounts offer customers a comparable interest rate on balances held by the bank. The main difference rests in how they’re used. Money market accounts can take on more of a checking account function, for instance. Depending on the account, you’re able to write checks and make debit transactions. Savings accounts, on the other hand, are typically reserved for cash that you don’t need to make ends meet on a day-to-day basis.

Money Market Account vs. Certificates of Deposit (CDs)
Unlike a money market account, CDs are time-deposit accounts that generally lack liquidity. With these products, you agree to lock up your money for a certain period of time and you earn a fixed rate of interest on your principal balance in return. Money market accounts, on the other hand, earn variable rates that can change at any time. Though many factors influence the interest rates available on both accounts, money market rates can be competitive with CD rates.

Money Market Account vs. Money Market Mutual Fund
Money market accounts are interest-bearing savings accounts through financial institutions, while money market mutual funds are low-risk investment funds available through brokers. A money market account is FDIC-insured, but a money market mutual fund is not.

Methodology
To create this list, Forbes Advisor analyzed more than 140 money market accounts at 85 financial institutions, including a mix of traditional brick-and-mortar banks, online banks and credit unions. We ranked each account on 14 data points within the categories of APY, minimum requirements, customer experience, digital experience, fees and accessibility of funds. All of the accounts on our list are online-based accounts. Here’s the weighting assigned to each category:
APY: 43%
Minimums: 15%
Accessibility of funds: 12%
Customer experience: 10%
Digital experience: 10%
Fees: 10%
Banks and credit unions offering the highest APYs rose to the top of this list, as did those with low fees and easy-to-meet minimum deposit and balance requirements. Accounts with high customer experience ratings and highly rated online and mobile banking tools were also ranked higher. And we prioritized money market accounts offering check-writing and debit card privileges. We also considered whether there were complex tier structures or requirements to earn the APY or other stipulations to earn the APY. High minimum deposit and balance requirements affected scores negatively. The money market account must be nationally available to appear on this list.

Money Market Account FAQs
Is a money market account a savings account?
A money market account is a type of savings account. You earn interest on the funds you deposit, and the interest you earn is compounded and deposited into your account.
How does a money market account work?
Money market accounts work similarly to savings accounts in that you earn interest on the funds you deposit. These accounts aren’t meant for everyday spending, like a checking product. But they tend to offer limited liquidity and access to funds—you may be able to write checks or make debit transactions.
Are money market accounts FDIC insured?
Yes, so long as they are at a financial institution insured either by the FDIC or the NCUA. All of the banks on our list are FDIC insured up to $250,000 per depositor, for each account ownership category, in the event of a bank failure. The NCUA provides similar coverage for all federal and most state-chartered credit unions. Connexus Credit Union is insured by the NCUA.
Are money market accounts taxable?
Yes, money market accounts are taxable. Any interest earned in a money market account is considered income by the IRS. Your bank or credit union should provide a 1099-INT form each year reporting taxable interest payments made to your account. If you don’t receive this form, you still must report taxable interest alongside your income when doing your taxes. And because MMAs are not tax-advantaged, everything you contribute is post-tax earnings.
Can you write checks from a money market account?
This practice varies. Some money market accounts allow you to write checks from the account or make debit card transactions. Generally, you’re limited to making six transactions per statement cycle, but each institution makes its own policies. Before opening an account, make sure to ask about withdrawal and excess transaction fees.
Can you lose money in a money market account?
No. Your money market account is safe as long as the institution is federally insured by the FDIC or NCUA. The FDIC insures MMAs at banks for up to $250,000 per depositor for each account ownership category, in the event of a bank failure. The NCUA provides similar coverage for all federal and most state-chartered credit unions. Money market accounts are also safe because they aren’t investment accounts. Your deposits are held securely until you need them, not invested in unpredictable assets such as stocks. Except for fees and penalties, there is no way to lose insured deposits in an MMA.
