Editor's Take
We chose Bank5 Connect High-Interest Checking for its high-interest checking account, which offers 2.00% APY on balances of $100 or more and comes with no monthly fees and the ability to earn cash-back rewards with your debit card. You’ll also get up to $15 per month in ATM fee reimbursements.
Why We Like It
We like Bank5’s high-yield, free checking account and its cash-back rewards debit card. The Bank5 Jumbo Savings account also offers a competitive 4.05% APY, but you’ll need to have a balance of at least $25,000 to qualify.
What We Don’t Like
Unless you can qualify for Bank5’s jumbo savings account, its savings rates aren’t the best around. Bank5’s ATM network is also fairly limited, but it does help that the bank doesn’t charge any ATM fees—and even offers reimbursements for ATM fees charged by other banks.
Who It’s Best For
You should look into Bank5 if you’re primarily looking for a rewarding, low-fee checking account. It might also be worth considering if you’ve got $25,000 or more to stash in savings.
Pros & Cons
High APY on checking account
Cash-back rewards debit card
No monthly maintenance fees
No ATM fees
ATM fee reimbursements
Competitive rate on jumbo savings account
100% deposit insurance through Depositors Insurance Fund (DIF) protection
Low APY on regular savings account
Small ATM network
Not available to residents of Massachusetts or Rhode Island
Details
Residents of Massachusetts and Rhode Island are not eligible to bank with Bank5 Connect. Accounts are insured by the FDIC, and all deposits above the FDIC limit of $250,000 are 100% insured by Depositors Insurance Fund (DIF) protection.

Editor's Take
We chose Quontic Bank as one of the best online banks because it offers top APYs on all its accounts: 1.10% APY on its Quontic Bank High Interest Checking account, 3.75% APY on its Quontic Bank High Yield Savings account, 4.25% APY on its Quontic Bank Money Market Account and 3.00% to 3.85% APY on its Quontic Bank Certificate of Deposit.
Why We Like It
We like Quontic’s high APYs and low fees and minimum deposit requirements. The bank also has a Quontic Bank Cash Rewards Checking account that pays up to 1.00% cash back on all qualifying debit card transactions.
What We Don’t Like
Quontic makes it easy to earn the stated APY on most of its accounts but to earn the 1.10% APY with its High Interest Checking account, you’ll need to make at least 10 qualifying debit card transactions of at least $10 each per statement cycle.
Who It’s Best For
You should go for this online bank if you’re after high APYs and want to be able to take care of all your banking in one place.
Quontic Bank High Interest Checking rates and details are accurate as of 07/22/2025. Quontic Bank High Yield Savings rates and details are accurate as of 05/01/2025. Quontic Bank Money Market Account rates and details are accurate as of 05/01/2025. Quontic Bank Certificate of Deposit rates and details are accurate as of 02/24/2025.
Pros & Cons
Offers cash-back checking, interest checking and bitcoin checking
Mobile and online banking
Access to more than 90,000 surcharge-free ATMs
Designated as a CDFI
Full-service bank
May find higher rates are available from some banks and credit unions

Details
Quontic Bank offers one savings account, two checking accounts, a money market account and six CDs with terms ranging from three months to 60 months.

Editor's Take
In addition to its competitive rates, low minimum deposit requirements and lack of fees, we chose Ally Bank for its unique online savings tools. With Ally’s savings account, you can create “buckets” that allow you to set 10 different savings goals within a single account. The bank also has a “round ups” feature that transfers the spare change from your transactions into your savings account. And the bank’s “surprise savings” feature analyzes your Ally checking account for money that’s safe to save and transfers it to your savings account automatically.
Why We Like It
As a full-service online bank, Ally offers an array of high-APY, low-fee checking and savings products. It has an extensive ATM network and reimburses up to $10 per statement cycle for fees charged at out-of-network ATMs.
What We Don’t Like
Ally’s money market account and CD rates aren’t the highest available.
Who It’s Best For
Consider Ally Bank if you’re looking to boost your savings account balance—its combination of unique savings tools and a generous savings APY will help you get there.
Pros & Cons
Offers helpful savings tools
High customer service satisfaction
24/7 customer service availability
Low to no fees and minimums
Out-of-network ATM fee reimbursement up to $10 per month
Higher rates are available from other banks and credit unions
No way to directly deposit cash
Details
Ally Bank offers a savings account, interest-checking account, money market account and CD terms from three months to five years. It also offers a raise your rate CD with terms of two and four years and a no-penalty CD with a term of 11 months.

Editor's Take
We chose Synchrony Bank because its Synchrony Bank High Yield Savings account pays 3.80% APY, charges no monthly fees and has no minimum deposit requirement. Unlike most savings accounts, Synchrony High Yield Savings comes with an ATM card for easy access to your funds.
Why We Like It
We like that all of Synchrony’s savings products—its high-yield savings account, money market account and CDs—charge no monthly fees and have no minimum deposit requirements. Its savings account APY is impressive, as are its rates on most CD terms.
What We Don’t Like
This online bank’s money market account pays less than what you could find elsewhere, and it doesn’t offer a checking account.
Who It’s Best For
Open an account at Synchrony Bank if you’re looking to open a high-yield savings account or CD, especially if you want to avoid monthly fees and minimum deposit requirements.
Synchrony Bank High Yield Savings rates and details are accurate as of 06/24/2025.
Pros & Cons
Competitive APY
No monthly fees
No minimum deposit requirement
Optional ATM card
$5 ATM fee reimbursement
No physical locations
Must be 18 or older to open
Details
Synchrony Bank is another top bank that charges very few fees. You won’t find a monthly maintenance fee or other common fees with its High Yield Savings account. You will, however, get charged for outgoing wire transfers, stop payment orders and overnight checks, each of which comes with a $25 fee. Synchrony doesn’t charge fees at any ATM displaying the Plus or Accel logos, but the ATM owner may charge a fee. To achieve Diamond status within the Perks Rewards program, you must either have a collective balance of $250,000 across your Synchrony accounts or have a relationship of at least five years with the bank.
All balances earn the same competitive 3.80% APY. There are no minimum balance requirements. Interest is compounded daily and credited monthly.

Editor's Take
Discover® Bank makes our list of best online banks for avoiding fees thanks to its zero-fees policy: no monthly maintenance fees, no insufficient funds fees and no out-of-network ATM fees. There’s also no fee for stop-payment orders, returned items or excessive withdrawals.
Why We Like It
Discover offers a full suite of banking products and services, including the Discover® Bank Online Savings Account earning 3.50% APY and the Discover® Cashback Debit Checking account that earns 1% cash back on up to $3,000 in debit card purchases each month. See website for details. And customers have access to an extensive ATM network.
What We Don’t Like
This online bank’s CD rates could be improved, although it does offer one of the best rates on 10-year CDs.
Who It’s Best For
Anyone looking to minimize fees while still earning competitive rates and rewards should look into Discover.
Discover® Bank Online Savings Account rates and details are accurate as of 09/12/2025. Discover® Cashback Debit Checking rates and details are accurate as of 07/22/2025.
Pros & Cons
Charges very few fees
Competitive APYs and cash back earnings
Highly rated mobile app
Extensive ATM network
24/7 customer service
Higher rates are available from other banks and credit unions
Doesn’t pay interest on checking account
Details
Discover Bank offers a cash back checking account, a high-yield savings account,  and CDs with terms from three months to 10 years. The mobile app is highly rated on the App Store and Google Play.

Editor's Take
We included NBKC Bank because it’s a full-service bank that offers interest-bearing accounts and keeps fees to an absolute minimum. There are no monthly maintenance fees, overdraft fees, minimum balance fees or foreign transaction fees. Plus, NBKC offers home loans, personal loans and more, so you can take care of all your financial needs in one place.
Why We Like It
NBKC Bank Everything Account is an interest-bearing checking and savings account combined into one. You can spend, save and pay bills from a single account. It comes with an extensive ATM network and reimburses up to $12 per month for out-of-network ATM fees. Its CD rates are also fairly competitive.
What We Don’t Like
While the Everything Account’s APY is impressive for a checking account, you could earn a lot more on your savings with one of the best high-yield savings accounts. NBKC’s money market account doesn’t offer the highest rate either.
Who It’s Best For
Go for NBKC Bank if you want to take care of all of your online banking, and potentially your loans, in one place. It’s also worth checking out if you like the idea of a combined checking and savings account.
Pros & Cons
Offers a combined checking and savings account
Low to no fees
Out-of-network ATM fee reimbursement up to $12 per month
High customer service satisfaction and live chat tool
Full-service bank
Higher rates are available from other banks and credit unions
Not designed for those who want separate checking and savings accounts
Details
NBKC Bank offers a combined checking and savings account, a money market account and CD terms from three months to five years. It also has an add-on CD that has a term of one year.

Editor's Take
We ranked SoFi® highly because its combined checking and savings account comes with a mobile check deposit feature that allows you to snap a photo of your check and access your funds as early as one day later. This interest-bearing account also comes with early direct deposit.
Why We Like It
You’ll earn 0.50% APY on checking and up to 3.80%¹ APY on savings if you set up eligible direct deposit, by depositing $5,000 or more every 30 days or by signing up for SoFi+. Customers who don’t meet this criteria earn 1.00% APY on savings balances with the SoFi Checking and Savings Account. You can even earn cash back when you use your SoFi debit card at qualifying businesses.
What We Don’t Like
This bank doesn’t offer standalone checking or savings accounts, nor does it offer money market or CD accounts.
Who It’s Best For
Opt for SoFi if you’re looking for a checking and savings account that earns competitive yields and comes with extra online banking features like mobile check deposit and savings roundups.
SoFi Checking and Savings Account rates and details are accurate as of 08/05/2025.
Pros & Cons
No minimum balance to open
No account fees for overdrafts or account maintenance
Receive direct deposits up to two days early
Impressive APY
Extensive ATM network and cash back at select retailers
No branch locations
Only banking product is a combined checking and savings account
Details
SoFi doesn’t offer separate checking or savings accounts at this time—only the combined SoFi Checking and Savings Account account. Up to 3.80%¹ APY on checking and savings account balances can be yours when you set up eligible direct deposit or by depositing $5,000 or more every 30 days, +0.70% Boost on Savings APY to up to 4.50% for up to 6 months on new accounts with eligible Direct Deposit.

Disclosures:

We awarded EverBank (formerly TIAA Bank) a top spot for its EverBank Performance CDs, which pay competitive rates ranging from 3.50% to 4.05% APY and have a modest opening deposit requirement of $1,000. EverBank CDs come in terms ranging from three months to five years.
Why We Like It
In addition to its competitive CD rates, EverBank charges no monthly fees on its bank accounts, no overdraft fee from a linked EverBank account and no ATM fees. EverBank’s checking account also automatically reimburses up to $15 each month for third-party ATM charges. Keep a minimum balance of $5,000 or more in your checking account and you’ll get unlimited ATM reimbursements.
What We Don’t Like
The online bank’s money market account doesn’t pay the highest rate, and EverBank doesn’t offer any CD accounts with terms longer than five years.
Who It’s Best For
EverBank is best for strategic savers who want to leverage a CD ladder to their advantage. The bank offers eight term lengths under three years and lets you build that sees a CD mature every three months. However, EverBank doesn’t currently offer any CD terms longer than five years.
Pros & Cons
Offers Yield Pledge promise
No monthly, overdraft or ATM fees
Unlimited out-of-network ATM fee reimbursement with a $5,000 minimum balance
Highly rated mobile app
Customer service is available seven days a week
You can find higher rates at other banks and credit unions, despite Yield Pledge
Details
EverBank offers a checking account (Yield Pledge Checking), a savings account, a money market account (Yield Pledge Money Market), basic CDs, a bump-up CD and what it calls an IntraFi CD, a CD that offers expanded FDIC insurance on deposits.

Editor's Take
We chose Capital One 360 as a top pick for customer service because it offers 24/7 customer service and has been ranked highest in overall customer satisfaction by J.D. Power for four years in a row. This bank is also a unique hybrid of a no-monthly-fee online bank and a brick-and-mortar bank. Its Capital One Cafés offer a place to get personal, face-to-face support from bank representatives and money coaches in a coffee-shop atmosphere. And Eno, the bank’s virtual assistant, is available in the mobile app or by text.
Why We Like It
None of the bank’s products require a minimum deposit or minimum balance, and Capital One 360 offers high yields on savings and CD accounts.
What We Don’t Like
This online bank’s Capital One Cafés are a unique perk, but it only has locations in select cities.
Who It’s Best For
Consider Capital One 360 if you want the low fees and high yields offered by online banks but don’t want to sacrifice good customer service to get them.
Pros & Cons
Capital One Cafés, with in-person banking support
No overdraft fees
Customer service available seven days a week
Large ATM network
No minimum deposit or balance requirements
No money market account
Capital One Cafés and branches only in select states
Details
Capital One 360 offers a savings account (360 Performance Savings), checking account (360 Checking) and CDs (360 CDs). It also offers a Kids Savings Account and MONEY Teen Checking.

What We Don’t Like
First Internet Bank’s savings rates on both its business and personal accounts are fairly low.
Who It’s Best For
Look into First Internet Bank if you want to open a business checking account, or a business or personal CD account.
First Internet Bank Certificate of Deposit (Personal) rates and details are accurate as of 01/13/2025.
Pros & Cons

Details

Money Market Savings has a $5 monthly fee, waived with a $4,000 minimum daily balance. It earns 3.46% APY with a daily balance of $5 million or below and 4.42% APY with a daily balance above $5 million. Regular Savings has a $2
2 monthly fee, waived with a $1,000 minimum daily balance. It earns 0.91% on all balances. You’ll need to call the bank for information about Commercial Checking.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
What Is Online Banking?
Online banking is banking conducted virtually, either through a website or mobile app. Rather than going to a branch or ATM to manage your money, you can do so via your laptop or smartphone.
Most traditional banks and credit unions offer online banking services to their customers. The range of services available usually doesn’t differ that much from what you’d find at the best online banks. The difference is that with traditional banking, you also have the option of visiting a branch. With online-only banking, you don’t.
How Does Online Banking Work?
Customers of online banks can initiate transactions online, through a mobile app, by phone or by mail. They also can link online bank accounts with accounts they have at traditional banks, credit unions or other online banks.
Online banking products and services vary by institution. Generally, online banks offer the ability to open accounts, pay bills, transfer funds, deposit checks, view statements and carry out other typical banking tasks. Many also offer access to surcharge-free ATM networks.
Pros and Cons of Online Banks
Pros
Lower Fees
Online banks have lower overhead costs and tend to charge fewer fees than brick-and-mortar banks. Many of the best banks online charge no:
Monthly maintenance fees
Minimum balance fees
Person-to-person transfer fees
Incoming wire transfer fees
Foreign transaction fees
Overdraft fees
ATM fees
Some online banks even offer ATM fee reimbursements for any fees charged by out-of-network ATM operators.
Higher Interest Rates
Not only do low costs mean fewer fees, but they also mean more competitive interest rates on checking accounts, savings accounts, CDs and money market accounts. Online banks tend to offer APYs well above the national average.
Extra Features
Some of the best online bank accounts come with digital extras that offer convenience and can help you budget and save. These include:
Mobile check deposit
Goal trackers
Automated savings
Financial calculators
Budgeting tools
Person-to-person payments
Integration with mobile wallet apps
Easy Applications
Online banks allow you to apply for accounts fully online, and their application processes often only take minutes to completely. The best online banks also have sleek, easy-to-use web and mobile interfaces.
Cons
No Branch Access
The most obvious disadvantage of online banks is that they don’t offer brick-and-mortar locations. This means you can’t do your banking in person.
ATM Networks May Be Limited
Many online banks have large ATM networks comparable to what traditional banks offer, but some online banks have a smaller or no ATM network. These banks typically offer some form of ATM fee reimbursements so you can use ATMs at other banks and not have to worry about fees, but these reimbursements may be limited to a certain amount per month.
May Not Accept Cash Deposits
Many online banks don’t accept cash deposits. If you regularly get paid in cash, make sure to find one that does—or opt for a brick-and-mortar bank.
Limited Range of Services
While plenty of online banks offer a full range of bank accounts, they may not offer all the financial products and services you’d find at a traditional bank. You may only have one option when it comes to choosing a checking or savings account, and some online banks don’t provide lending or investment services.
How To Choose an Online Bank
Pro Tip
If you’re new to online banking, consider starting with a savings account. This can be the home of your emergency fund, or even something that you’re saving up for, like a vacation. You’ll receive a higher yield than you would otherwise get from a traditional bank, and you’ll get used to the rhythms of online banking with an account that you don’t use day-to-day.
Here are some other things to consider when choosing an online bank:
Fees. Pesky fees can quickly eat into your overall bank balance. Look for an online bank that keeps fees of all types to a minimum. That includes monthly fees, overdraft fees and ATM fees. It’s even better if the bank reimburses for third-party ATM charges. Analyze your banking behavior to figure out which fees you need to worry about most. You can often avoid fees with the right bank.
APYs. If you’re looking to get the most for your money, find a bank that pays a competitive APY on its financial products. Online banks tend to pay higher rates, so do some comparison shopping to get the best rates you can.
Minimums. Lower minimum deposit and balance requirements generally make it easier to maintain an account. Find an online bank with minimum requirements that meet your financial comfort level.
Products. The online bank you choose depends heavily on the products you need. Some online banks are full-service financial institutions, offering checking, savings, money market accounts, CDs and other products. Others limit their offerings.
ATM network. If having access to cash is important, look for an online bank that offers an extensive surcharge-free ATM network. Check the bank’s site to make sure there are ATMs close to your location or in the areas where you travel most.
Customer experience. Online banks typically don’t offer branch access, and if they do, it’s often limited. That’s why it’s essential to keep customer support in mind when shopping for an online bank. Look for a bank that offers easily accessible customer service representatives or online chat alternatives.
Digital banking experience. Convenience is crucial in the world of digital banking. With an online bank, your primary interactions occur via the bank’s website and mobile app. The best online banks provide a simple online interface and highly rated mobile apps for banking on the go. Check out reviews of the mobile app on the App Store and Google Play.
Safety. Look for a bank insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which provides up to $250,000 in insurance per depositor, per bank, for each account ownership category, in the event of a bank failure. At credit unions, make sure the account is insured by the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA).
Is Online Banking Safe?
Generally, online banks are safe. Look for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to insure your accounts. Online banks with FDIC insurance have the same protections as banks with branches.
In many ways, online accounts are safer than traditional bank accounts because of online statements and the focus on digital transactions instead of paper checks. Avoiding paper statements and checks eliminates an opportunity for fraud that many thieves take advantage of.
How To Open an Online Bank Account
You can open a bank account online via your chosen bank or credit union’s website or mobile app. From there, you’ll generally follow the same steps that you would to open a bank account at a branch. Here’s a typical step-by-step process for opening a bank account online:
Visit the bank or credit union’s website, or launch its mobile app.
Find the type of bank account you want to open, and fill out an application for a new account.
Verify your identity and provide other required information, which may include your address, phone number and email.
Make a minimum deposit, if required.
Wait for your deposit to clear, which may take a few days. Then, start using your new account.

Who Are Online Banks Best For?
Online banks are best suited for people who are comfortable doing all their banking online or through a mobile app. These banks offer big advantages to anyone who wants to earn higher interest rates and avoid paying banking fees.
–Elizabeth Aldrich, deputy editor at Forbes Advisor
However, if you prefer face-to-face interactions and still like to take care of some of your banking needs in person, an online bank might not be the best choice for you.
Recap: Best Online Banks of 2025
Bank5 Connect: Best for Checking Accounts
We rated Bank5 Connect as one of our best because it offers high-interest checking that comes with a cash-back debit card and no monthly fees.
Quontic Bank: Best for High APYs
We rated Quontic as one of our best because it offers high-interest checking and savings accounts as well as a rewards checking account, all with no monthly fees.
Ally Bank: Best for Savings Tools
Ally Bank offers unique savings tools on its savings account, such as savings buckets to categorize your funds and the ability to round purchases up to the nearest dollar and transfer the spare change to savings.
Discover® Bank: Best for No Fees
Discover has a zero-fee policy, which means no monthly fees, no overdraft fees and no ATM fees.
Synchrony Bank: Best for High-Yield Savings
Synchony Bank’s savings account helped it top our list because it pays a generous APY, charges no monthly fees and comes with an ATM card.
NBKC Bank: Best for Full-Service Banking
The Everything Account at NBKC Bank is an all-in-one account that earns interest and offers ATM access with almost no fees. It also offers attractive MMAs, CDs and loans.
SoFi®: Best for Mobile Check Deposit
SoFi made our list for its combined checking and savings account, which comes with extra features like mobile check deposit, early direct deposit and savings tools on top of earning a competitive APY.
EverBank: Best for CDs
EverBank ranked highly because it promises to offer rates comparable to those offered by the top 5% of competitive accounts, and its CD rates are some of the best available.
Capital One 360: Best for Customer Service
Capital One 360 made our list because it ranks highly for customer satisfaction year after year, and it offers an array of low-fee, high-yield online accounts as well as branch access.
First Internet Bank: Best for Small Business
We chose First Internet Bank because it offers a long list of business banking products with low fees and competitive APYs.
Methodology
To create this list, Forbes Advisor analyzed the products and services of 60 online banks, including a mix of large and small online banks and neobanks. We ranked each bank on 12 data points within the categories of product offerings, APY, fees, ATM network, customer experience, digital experience and minimum requirements.
Here’s the weighting assigned to each category:
Product offerings: 20%
APY: 20%
Fees: 20%
ATM network: 10%
Customer experience: 10%
Digital experience: 10%
Minimums: 10%
Online banks offering the highest APYs and lowest fees across their products rose to the top of the list, as did those with a low minimum deposit and balance requirements and a broad ATM network. Banks with high customer satisfaction and an intuitive digital banking experience also earned higher scores. To appear on this list, the bank must be an online bank with national availability.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
What are the best online banks?
The best online banks are those that meet your needs. If you’re happy with your current banking relationship but want to earn more interest on your savings, consider finding an online bank with a competitive high-yield savings account.
If you’re looking to replace your current bank, focus on the overall package. Look for an online bank that keeps fees and minimum requirements low, offers high APYs and provides easy access to your money via ATMs and mobile apps. Seek out a bank with excellent customer service as well.
Are online banks FDIC-insured?
The FDIC insures many online banks. Other online banks are affiliated with brick-and-mortar banks that are FDIC insured. And some offer additional insurance protections through organizations like the Massachusetts Depositors Insurance Fund (DIF).
FDIC-insured accounts are covered up to $250,000 per depositor, for each ownership category, in the event of a bank failure. Before opening a bank account, confirm that the financial institution is FDIC insured. Look for the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) to insure nationally chartered, and many state-chartered, credit unions for similar amounts.
Do online banks have ATMs?
Online banks usually don’t operate their own branded ATMs, but in many cases, they offer fee-free ATM access through partner banks. ATM networks vary in size depending on which bank you use, with some of the best online banks offering free access to more than 37,000 ATMs nationwide. If you withdraw cash often, check whether your account comes with ATM fee reimbursements, as out-of-network ATM surcharges can quickly add up.
What bank accounts can I open for free?
There’s no such thing as a completely free bank account. All bank accounts come with fees attached in some form. But it is possible to find checking accounts and savings accounts with no monthly maintenance fees.
How do you get a bank statement online?
You can retrieve your bank statements by logging into your account and navigating to the statements page of your bank’s website.
Why is my online bank account locked?
Online bank accounts can become locked for a few reasons. Banks can freeze them if incorrect credentials, such as a username or password, are entered too many times. Accounts could also become locked if the online bank detects suspicious activity, such as fraud or money laundering. In some cases, your account could be locked if you have too many unpaid debts with creditors or the government.
Why can't I open a bank account online?
You might not be able to open a bank account online if you don’t have certain required documents, such as a government-issued photo ID, U.S. residential address, Social Security number or taxpayer identification number. Additionally, your application might be denied if you’ve had too many negative marks, such as overdrafts or bounced checks, reported to ChexSystems.
How do you deposit cash into an online bank?
If your online bank has an ATM network that allows cash deposits, you can typically deposit cash at an in-network ATM the same way you would with a traditional bank. Some online banks without ATM networks offer cash deposits at certain retailers, though this may result in a fee of up to $5 or more. Many online banks don’t support cash deposits at all but may offer a mobile check deposit feature.
