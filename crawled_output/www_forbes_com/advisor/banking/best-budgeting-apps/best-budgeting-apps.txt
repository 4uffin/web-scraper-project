Editor's Take
Personal finance expert Dave Ramsey’s budgeting app, EveryDollar, earned a top rating of five stars. The app employs a zero-based budgeting approach and offers both a free version and a paid version with additional features, including unlimited budget categories, insights into spending trends and paycheck planning.
Why We Like It
Unlike some other budgeting apps, EveryDollar’s user-friendly interface makes it easy to navigate. It offers unlimited, customizable budget categories and insights into spending trends. We also like that the app offers a free version as well as a 14-day free trial for premium accounts.
What We Don’t Like
We don’t like that syncing transactions automatically with EveryDollar requires a Premium account, which costs $17.99 per month or $79.99 a year.

EveryDollar is best for individuals who prefer using a zero-based budgeting approach to pay off debt and meet savings goals.

App features include customizable budgets, the ability to split transactions, savings funds, downloadable CSV files of budgets, insights on spending trends and due date reminders for bills.

4.6/5
based on 5,000+ ratings
Editor's Take
Wallet by BudgetBakers automatically categorizes your spending and provides a clear overview of your cash flow for the month in an easy-to-navigate interface.
Why We Like It
We like that Wallet makes it easy for users to analyze their cash flow and spot areas that need improvement. Wallet automatically categorizes your spending, identifies recurring payments and shows you your expected net cash balances to help you plan ahead.
What We Don’t Like
To automatically sync transactions, you’ll need a paid version. Additionally, prices aren’t clearly defined on Budgetbakers’ website. Instead, you may see a different price depending on the method you use to sign up for a premium account.
Who It’s Best For
Wallet is ideal for individuals who prefer data reports and easy-to-read graphics and charts to track their cash flow.
Pros & Cons
Automatically syncs with 15,000+ institutions
User-friendly interface
Can be shared with others
Useful data reports
Cannot autosync transactions with the free version
Pricing not clearly stated on website
Details
Wallet by BudgetBakers offers a free version, but its functions are limited. There is a 14-day free trial for a premium plan, which you can purchase for a one-time payment of $49.99 or by paying $5.99 a month. Note that prices may vary.
The Wallet app is available on both Android (4.5 stars) and iOS (4.6 stars). App features include syncing with over 15,000 banking institutions, recurring or one-time budgets, spending overviews, recurring payment identification, cash flow insights, investment management and automatically categorized charges.
Lunch Money
Best for Desktop Budgeting
Lunch Money
5.0
Our ratings take into account a product’s features, costs, consumer ratings, security and other category-specific attributes. All ratings are determined solely by our editorial team.
Cost

$50-$150/year or $10/month

4.6/5
based on about 20 ratings
4.9/5
based on a handful of ratings
Editor's Take
Lunch Money offers a simple way to track your spending habits and manage your finances, and has a unique “set your own price” payment structure. Notable features offered by Lunch Money include automatic transaction imports, recurring expense tracking, spending analytics and more.
Why We Like It
We like that Lunch Money offers a wide range of features, including more advanced options such as multicurrency support, crypto portfolio syncing and a “rules engine” to control how transactions are categorized.
What We Don’t Like
We don’t like that there is no free version of Lunch Money. We also don’t like that the Lunch Money mobile app offers limited functionality.
Who It’s Best For
Since Lunch Money is optimized for desktop, it’s ideal for individuals who prefer to manage their budget through a web browser, rather than on their phone.
Pros & Cons
Designed for easy use
Collaboration option to budget with others
Mobile app designed to complement, not replace the web app
Few mobile app reviews
No specific “goal-setting” feature
No free version
Details
Lunch Money offers a $10 monthly payment option, as well as an annual “set your own price” option that ranges from $50 to $150. Lunch Money is a web-first app, meaning it’s optimized for a laptop or desktop computer. The Lunch Money app is available on both Android (4.6 stars) and iOS (4.9 stars), although there are very few ratings.
Rocket Money
Best for Managing Subscriptions
Rocket Money
4.9

Cost

4.5/5

Editor's Take
Rocket Money is a solid option if you’re looking to identify areas of your spending where you can cut back and save. Rocket Money analyzes your transactions to identify recurring expenses and even offers a bill negotiation option to help you lower your monthly bills. It also allows users to set specific savings goals and automate savings.
Why We Like It
We like that Rocket Money makes it easy to identify unwanted subscriptions and will even cancel them on your behalf. Rocket Money also offers free credit score tracking and access to credit reports.
What We Don’t Like
We don’t like that Rocket Money charges a fee for successful bill negotiations. Additionally, customer reviews are mixed regarding the bill negotiation feature as a whole.
Who It’s Best For
Rocket Money is best for individuals looking to save money by identifying and canceling unwanted subscriptions.
Pros & Cons
Subscription tracking and cancellation
Credit score monitoring
Autosave feature
Bill negotiation
Limited investment features
Free version is limited
Bill negotiation fee
Details
Rocket Money offers a free version with limited functionality, as well as a paid version that costs between $6 and $12 per month. If bill negotiation is successful, RocketMoney charges a fee of 35% to 60% of your first year’s savings.
The Rocket Money app is available on both Android (4.7 stars) and iOS (4.5 stars). Rocket Money features include subscription management, net worth tracking, budgeting tools, bill negotiation, spending insights and credit score monitoring.

4.9/5
based on 51,000+ ratings
Editor's Take
Monarch is a feature-rich budgeting app that provides a comprehensive overview of your accounts. Users can even customize widgets on their dashboard to focus on specific areas of their finances. It’s a suitable option for budgeteers looking to replace the discontinued Mint app, offering features like custom savings and debt paydown goals, spending forecasts, bill payment reminders, net worth tracking and investment insights.
Why We Like It
Monarch offers two budgeting options: flex budgeting and category budgeting, allowing users to find a strategy that works best for them. Its transaction-tracking and reporting tools are also exhaustive, and there’s an option to collaborate with your partner on one dashboard.
What We Don’t Like
Monarch does not offer a free version. It costs $99.99 per year or $14.99 per month.
Who it’s best for
Monarch is best suited for individuals seeking a replacement for Mint, offering a range of budgeting tools from basic to advanced. It’s also a solid choice for couples, as budgets can be shared with a partner.
Pros & Cons
Share with a partner
Collaborate with your financial advisor
Unlimited, customizable goals
Automated tracking features
No free version
No bill-lowering tool
Details
Monarch costs $99.99 a year or $14.99 a month after a seven-day free trial. The Monarch app is available on both Android (4.7 stars) and iOS (4.9 stars). Features offered by Monarch include net worth tracking, custom reports, custom budget categories, savings goals and debt payoff options.
Albert
Best for Automatic Savings
Albert
4.8
Our ratings take into account a product’s features, costs, consumer ratings, security and other category-specific attributes. All ratings are determined solely by our editorial team.
Cost

$14.99/month, $19.99/month or $39.99/month, based on plan
(after 30-day free trial)
4.5/5
based on 120,000+ ratings
4.6/5
based on 240,000+ ratings
Editor's Take
Albert automatically syncs your accounts to track your financial transactions and cash flow, and then creates a budget for you based on your spending. The app also detects recurring bills and subscriptions, then helps you lower or cancel them. Other features include the ability to create specific savings goals, notifications for upcoming bill payments, investment management and the option to share your budget with a partner.
Why We Like It
We like that Albert makes saving money easier through auto savings. After analyzing your spending and income, Albert finds places to put aside a little bit of money throughout the week to boost your savings balance over time.
What We Don’t Like
We don’t like that Albert does not offer a free version, and that its higher-tier plans are relatively expensive. To access all features, you’ll have to opt for the Genius+ plan, which costs $21.99 a month.
Who It’s Best For
Albert is ideal for individuals seeking a budgeting app that automates budget creation—a “set it and forget it” approach. Albert’s automated budgeting tools may not appeal to those who prefer a more hands-on approach.
Pros & Cons
Automated savings
Access to a financial expert via chat
Can be shared with a partner
Credit score monitoring
Investment management
Premium plans are pricey
Basic plan offers limited features
No free version
Less customization than other budgeting apps
Details
Albert offers three plans for users to choose from. The Basic plan—which includes budget and spending tracking, spending trends/insights and savings tools—costs $14.99 per month. The Genius plan costs $39.99 per month, but offers additional features such as investing tools, identity protection and credit score monitoring.
The Genius+ plan offers all benefits included with the Basic and Genius plans, as well as access to financial advice. It costs $39.99 a month. There is a 30-day free trial. The Albert app is available on both Android (4.5 stars) and iOS (4.6 stars).
Try for 30 days before you’re charged. Individual plans start at $14.99/mo. Albert Family Plan costs $39.99/mo. Fees auto-renew until canceled. Cancel in the app. Terms apply.

Editor's Take
Spendee’s simple design and intuitive interface make it a worthwhile option for those new to budgeting or budgeting apps.
Why We Like It
We like that Spendee offers a free version, and its paid versions are more affordable compared to other apps on this list. Spendee’s simple, clean graphics can help users better understand their financial habits and set smart budgets catered to their needs. Spendee also offers automatic transaction imports, multiple currency support and bill pay reminders.
What We Don’t Like
Spendee’s added features are quite limited when compared to other apps on this list.
Who It’s Best For
Spendee is ideal for budgeteers seeking a straightforward way to manage their finances, without some of the bells and whistles offered by other apps.
Pros & Cons
Can be shared with others
User-friendly interface

Editor's Take
YNAB employs a zero-based budgeting approach, where every dollar is “given a job” and assigned to a specific category. This approach, along with additional goal-tracking features, makes setting and meeting financial goals easier.
Why We Like It
We like that YNAB offers a goal-tracking feature designed to help individuals become more intentional about where their money goes each month. Users can set custom savings goals, and YNAB will calculate how much they need to save—each week, month, year or by a specific date—to reach their goal. YNAB even sends reminders of how much money you should be adding to a category to stay on track with your set goal.
What We Don’t Like
With YNAB, you can only budget using the funds currently available in your account, which means you cannot allocate based on expected income for the month. YNAB also requires new users to categorize transactions manually.
Who It’s Best For
YNAB is best for individuals who want to be more intentional with their savings and spending habits by deciding where each dollar goes every month, whether it’s toward bills or allocated into specific savings categories.
Pros & Cons
Accessible from several devices
Shareable with six other people
Live help from YNAB staff, along with interactive webinars
Lack of investment tracking
No free version
Manual categorization of transactions
Details
YNAB costs $109 a year or $14.99 a month (after a 34-day free trial). The YNAB app is available on both Android (4.7 stars) and iOS (4.8 stars).
App features include spending and net worth reports, a loan calculator, goal-tracking tools, category templates, customizable spending and savings categories and automatic transaction imports.

Methodology
To create this list, Forbes Advisor analyzed 38 budgeting apps. We ranked each budgeting app on 18 data points within the categories of platform usability and availability of features, customer ratings, costs associated with the app, security and encryption of consumers’ data and desktop availability.
The following is the weighting assigned to each category:
Features and usability: 50%
Mobile app rating (Apple App Store and Google Play): 20%
Cost: 15%
Encryption/security: 10%
Website version available: 5%
Budgeting apps with a higher overall rating relative to their number of reviews ranked higher on our list, as did those that are completely free. We also prioritized mobile apps with advanced security features, such as biometric authentication, multifactor authentication and encryption. Apps that allow the ability to connect an unlimited number of accounts moved toward the top of our list, as did apps that also have a website version and allow for sharing with family or friends.
How To Choose a Budgeting App
When choosing a budgeting app, you’ll want to consider several factors.
Fees: Prices vary between budgeting apps, and some offer free versions. Typically, paid apps offer advanced features and functionality that could pay off in the long run.
Features: When choosing a budgeting app, look for one with features that cater to your specific financial needs and goals. Many apps offer a trial period, so test run a few to see which have the features that work best for you. Standard features among budget apps include bank account integration, expense tracking, bill reminders, goal setting and the ability to categorize expenses.
Security: When dealing with personal financial information, security should be a top priority. Check to see what security measures a budgeting app utilizes, such as multifactor identification and encryption.
Customer Service: You might run into a problem when using a budgeting app, in which case, quality customer service can be helpful. For this reason, it’s important to compare customer service options between apps before choosing one.

Are Budgeting Apps Worth It?
Budgeting apps can be valuable tools for managing your finances. Many budgeting apps automatically sync with your bank accounts to import your data, making it easy to view your monthly cash flow and identify areas of spending that can be cut back on (such as forgotten or unwanted subscriptions) as well as how much you can save each month.
Pros and Cons of Budgeting Apps
Pros:
Syncing: Many budgeting apps will sync with your bank account to import your data, providing an overview of all your financial accounts in one place.
Goal Setting: Goal-setting features offered by budgeting apps can help you organize your various savings goals and decide how much to allocate to each every month.
Convenience: One of the main appeals of a budgeting app is convenience. Most apps take the legwork out of building a budget manually and automatically identify and categorize expenses for you.
Cons:
Fees: While many budgeting apps offer a free version, you typically won’t be able to access the app’s full range of functions. It’s essential to weigh the cost of a budgeting app before purchase to see if the investment will pay off in the long run.
Device Limitations: Some budgeting apps are accessible via both desktop and mobile devices, while others are only fully functional on one.

Alternatives to Budgeting Apps
Budgeting apps aren’t the only way to manage your finances. Here are some alternative options to budgeting apps you may want to consider.
Budgeting Software
If you’re looking for additional features not offered by standard budgeting apps, consider opting for a budgeting software like QuickBooks or Quicken, which offer expanded capabilities such as tax software integration and payment management.
Spreadsheet Budgeting
If you prefer a hands-on approach to budgeting, you may want to consider spreadsheet budgeting. With spreadsheet budgeting, you’ll record all your sources of income for the month, as well as all transactions across your various accounts. From here, you can categorize your expenses and identify areas where you could save and how to allocate that extra money going forward.
If you’re looking for a starting point, consider following the 50/30/20 budget to divide your expenses.
Cash Envelope Budgeting
Cash envelope budgeting is another strategy for managing your finances. As the name suggests, this strategy involves dividing the cash you earn each month into envelopes based on category, such as money for rent, groceries, paying off debt or building an emergency fund.

“How to finance not only your day-to-day needs but also your aspirations—that’s the objective of people everywhere, in every income group, in every circumstance,” wrote famed personal finance author Sylvia Porter in her “Money Book.”
What is the best budgeting app not linked to a bank account?
