Editor's Take
Synchrony High-Yield Savings is a great option if you’re looking for a stand-alone savings account. It offers a competitive interest rate, few fees or minimums and access to ATMs (which not all savings accounts do).
Why We Like It
With a high yield, robust customer service features and few fees, the account offers a solid package for savers.
What We Don’t Like
Synchrony is an online-only bank, making it less useful for folks who prioritize in-person communication or who want to deposit cash.
Who It’s Best For
Consider this account if you’re looking for a new emergency fund that’s not attached to a checking account. (Synchrony doesn’t offer one.)
Pros & Cons
High savings yield, with daily compounding interest
No monthly fees or minimums
No overdraft fees
24/7 automated customer service
Access to ATMs
No physical branches
$25 fee for outgoing domestic wire transfers
Limited to six withdrawals per month
Details
Earn an APY of 3.80% that compounds daily.
No monthly maintenance fee, required minimum deposits or overdraft fees.
No incoming wire transfer fees, though you’ll owe $25 for domestic wires. (No international wires available.)
Access to ATM card, and no-fee options through the Plus or Accel networks. Receive up to $5 per statement in reimbursements on ATMs used in the U.S.
Limited to 6 withdrawals per month, though that doesn’t count ATM withdrawals. After that, your withdrawals will be denied, but there is no fee.
24/7 customer service available via the phone and there’s a chatbot that can connect you to a human representative.

Editor's Take
Capital One 360 Performance Savings is an excellent choice if you’re looking for a high-yield savings account with the ability to bank in person and avoid most fees and minimum requirements. While the account’s APY is much higher than the national average, you’ll find better options on this list.
Why We Like It
While consumers are becoming more comfortable banking online, it can be useful to have the option to bank in person, which Capital One allows. The account itself imposes few fees and offers a reasonably high yield.
What We Don’t Like
While the yield is high compared to the national average, there are superior options elsewhere in our ranking.
Who It’s Best For
This is the only bank on our list that has hundreds of banking branches, including its cafes, while also offering a competitive yield on its savings products. If you want to have the option of talking to a human in the flesh, this savings account may be right for you.
Pros & Cons
No monthly fees
No minimum deposit or balance requirements
24/7 customer service available by phone
Bank branches available
Higher APYs available elsewhere
Other national banks have more branches
Interest compounds monthly rather than daily
Details
You’ll earn 3.50% on all balances and interest compounds monthly.
There’s no monthly maintenance or overdraft fee, though you’re not allowed to overdraft on your account.
No minimum balance requirement to open an account or earn interest.
Outgoing domestic wire transfers cost $30; international outgoing wires cost $40 and need to be completed at a branch.
The savings account doesn’t come with an ATM card; you’ll need a checking account, as well.
You are limited to 6 withdrawals per month. However, that limit is currently not being enforced, according to the account disclosure.
Customer service available by phone 24/7.

Editor's Take
If you’re looking for a high-yielding savings account from one of the nation’s largest financial institutions, this Amex product might be right for you. Still, you’ll find higher yields from other winners.
Why We Like It
American Express offers the advantages of a large financial institution, including easy-to-use digital banking features and good customer service. There are few fees, and the yield is much higher than that of many national banks.
What We Don’t Like
While high by comparison, you can still find better yields from some of our other winners. Moreover, the account doesn’t come with check-writing privileges or ATM access, making it less flexible for savers.
Who It’s Best For
American Express offers a solid digital banking experience and scores well on independent customer service metrics, making it an ideal fit for someone chiefly concerned with the ease of using an account.
Pros & Cons
No minimum balance requirement
No monthly maintenance fees
Good customer service
Daily compounding interest
Higher yields available elsewhere
No check-writing privileges
No ATM access
Details
You’ll earn 3.50% APY ($0 Minimum to earn APY, rates as of 7/23/2025) on all balances, with interest compounding daily.
There are no monthly maintenance fees, no minimum deposit requirement and you can open an account with any amount.
Overdrafts are not allowed, and there’s no fee.
There’s no access to ATMs or checks, but wire transfers are permitted..
There’s no transaction limit.
You can reach customer service 24/7, including via the mobile app.

Editor's Take
The Marcus by Goldman Sachs High-Yield Online Savings account is a solid account for folks who want to avoid fees, earn an attractive yield (although not the highest) and take advantage of 24/7 customer service.
Why We Like It
You’ll earn a tidy yield on your savings, and you won’t have to deal with maintenance fees or minimum deposits. Plus, Marcus customers have access to 24/7 customer service and have reported high levels of satisfaction in independent analysis, such as the 2024 J.D. Power U.S. Direct Banking Satisfaction Study.
What We Don’t Like
While its yield is competitive, it’s not the highest on the market. Moreover, Marcus doesn’t offer a checking account, so full-service banking isn’t an option, and you can’t access your funds via an ATM, making the account less convenient.
Who It’s Best For
You’ll earn a solid yield on all balances without having to meet any requirements or pay many fees. That makes this account a good choice for someone looking to park cash for a future need (such as Christmas presents or a car down payment) and benefit from highly rated customer service.
Pros & Cons
Low fees
No minimums
Decent yield
Good customer service
Higher yields elsewhere
No physical branches
No ATM access
Details
You’ll earn a yield of 3.65% APY on all balances, up to maximum balance limits on all balances and interest compounds daily.
There’s no minimum balance requirement and no monthly maintenance fee. Marcus doesn’t impose a fee for outgoing or incoming wire transfers, although you can only send a transfer to an account you own at another bank.
No access to ATMs, so you shouldn’t use this account if you think you’ll need to dip into your savings in a pinch.
Still, you can make as many transfers out of your savings account as you wish.
Customer service via the phone is available 24/7, and existing customers can use the chatbot for instant communication.

Editor's Take
The Barclays Tiered Savings account charges few, if any, fees and offers an elevated yield with no minimum deposit requirement.
Why We Like It
With no monthly fee, minimum deposit requirement or nonsufficient funds fee, you can start saving with any balance without worrying about fees offsetting the interest you earn. Interest compounds daily and there is no limit to the amount of withdrawals or transfers you can make.
What We Don’t Like
You won’t have access to any branches or ATMs. Additionally, you won’t have the option to do all your banking at Barclays, since there are no checking accounts offered.
Who It’s Best For
This account is a good option for savers looking for a no-cost account that earns a solid APY on all balances.
Pros & Cons
No fees
No minimums

Editor's Take
SoFi Checking and Savings Account is a no-fee account with perks. As its name suggests, this is a joint checking and savings account that earns interest on both savings and checking balances.
Why We Like It
SoFi pays respectable APYs on both the savings and checking portions of your balance (with savings balances earning the highest interest) and offers additional FDIC insurance up to $3 million. You can also qualify for no-fee overdraft coverage and early paycheck receipt.
What We Don’t Like
This account likely won’t be a good fit for anyone who doesn’t want to deposit their pay. Signing up for direct deposit is required to unlock all account features and the highest interest rate.
Who It’s Best For
This account is an attractive option for those who enjoy digital banking and like the idea of having their checking and savings in one place. Consider this combination account if you’re looking for a rewarding place to send your paycheck.
Pros & Cons
Earns APY
Early direct deposit

The Discover Online Savings account offers a solid 3.50% with almost no fees and no minimum balance requirements.
Why We Like It
Discover stands out for its commitment to minimizing fees. You won’t pay fees for account maintenance, nonsufficient funds, excessive withdrawals, official bank checks and a host of other banking services.
What We Don’t Like
Though this account’s APY is many times higher than the national average, it’s not one of the highest yields on our list. Also, Discover has only one branch, and unless it’s near you, you won’t be able to access any in-person services.
Who It’s Best For
This account is best for those who want a no-fee savings account with no minimum balance requirements, and those who would benefit from 24/7 U.S.-based customer support.
Pros & Cons
No fees
Solid APY
Customer service available 24/7

Editor's Take
The Quontic Bank High-Yield Savings account offers an attractive yield on all deposits with few fees, making it a good option for your emergency fund—as long as you don’t mind a completely online banking experience.
Why We Like It
Overall, the account is a satisfactory deal for most consumers. You’ll earn a solid yield on your savings, avoid many fees (such as no-charge overdrafts) and have access to customer service, including live chat.
What We Don’t Like
While the yield is higher than most banks, you can find slightly better options on this list. Moreover, we would prefer if Quontic didn’t have a minimum deposit requirement and reimbursed you for at least some out-of-network ATM costs.
Who It’s Best For
Quontic doesn’t charge for overdrafts or excess transactions, which will be helpful if you want to avoid costly fees.
Pros & Cons
No monthly maintenance fee
Good customer service
Interest compounds daily
Live chat support
No in-person branches
Limited account funding options
Details
You’ll earn 3.75% on all balances, and interest compounds daily and is credited monthly.
There are no fees for overdrafts or excess transactions, meaning you can withdraw from your account as often as you’d like without facing a charge.
You’ll have to pony up at least $100 to open and maintain your account. There are some fees, including $25 for outgoing domestic wire transfers and $35 for international ones. Dormant accounts will be charged $5 monthly, so make sure you keep your account active or close it if you no longer need it.
You’ll have access to more than 90,000 fee-free ATMs across the country, which you can locate from Quontic’s map, but you won’t be reimbursed for fees imposed by out-of-network ATM operators.
Quontic Bank is a member of the FDIC, and all deposits are insured up to the maximum limit of $250,000 per depositor.
Recent News on Savings Interest Rates
At the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting held on September 17, 2025, Fed Chair Jerome Powell announced that the board voted to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter point, lowering the target range to 4.00%-4.25%.
It was the first reduction of the year and came in response to a slower labor market, weaker consumer spending and inflation that remains above the Fed’s 2% target.
Because the cut was just announced, savings rates have not yet changed. But banks are expected to adjust in the coming weeks and months. Rates on savings accounts generally move down in lockstep with policy cuts.
How High Will Savings Interest Rates Go in 2025?
How high savings interest rates will go is probably the wrong question; you’re better off asking, “How low might they fall?” That’s because the Federal Reserve is done raising interest rates.
Over the next six to 12 months, savings yields are likely to drift lower as the Fed continues to reduce the federal funds rates. Some banks will adjust quickly, while others may hold off depending on how much they want to attract deposits. Online banks, with lower operating costs, may keep offering higher rates longer than large traditional banks. Find out more about today’s savings rates and the APYs banks are paying now.
Pro Tip
If you’re concerned about declining savings rates and have money you feel comfortable setting aside, consider opening a certificate of deposit. CDs offer fixed rates, allowing you to lock in a high APY for an extended period of time. Opening one before a Fed rate cut can help you secure a higher rate for longer.
Is a High-Yield Savings Account the Best Option?
A high-yield savings account is the best option for you if you:
Want to earn the highest possible interest rate
Don’t want to deal with monthly fees
Want to ensure your funds are protected by the FDIC or NCUA
A high-yield savings account may not be the best option if you:
Require access to branches or in-person customer service
Need to deposit cash into your account
Plan to withdraw or transfer from your account regularly (note that some high-yield savings accounts, including many on our list, do not currently have transaction limits in place)
Need to write checks
Want to lock in an interest rate
How To Choose a High-Yield Savings Account
Your search for a new high-yield savings account should mirror our methodology: Yields should factor in most prominently, while fees and the digital experience should follow.
Look for the best interest rates. The interest rate on a savings account determines how much your money grows, so it’s important to earn a competitive yield. Before doing anything else, compare the highest rates.
Look into fees. While many high-yield savings accounts have no monthly maintenance fees, most charge fees for other activities and services. Check out an account’s fee schedule on its website.
Pay attention to digital features. Strong mobile apps, user-friendly online banking platforms and built-in budgeting and savings tools such as savings buckets and auto-save options can make your life easier.
Learn about customer satisfaction. Read customer reviews on rating platforms and app stores to learn about a bank or account’s strengths and weaknesses from real users. It’s also a good idea to look for formal complaints about an institution.
Check minimums. You can open and maintain many savings accounts with $0, but some have minimum deposit and balance requirements you must meet to open or earn interest. If an account has minimum requirements, make sure they work for your savings plans.
Pro Tip
If you’re looking for the highest rates available on high-yield savings accounts, I recommend opting for an online-only bank. These institutions typically offer significantly higher rates compared to rates offered by large, national banks, because they lack the overhead costs associated with maintaining physical branches. When choosing an account, also be aware of monthly fees. The best high-yield savings accounts have no monthly fees, allowing you to keep all interest earned.
How Much Money Should I Put Into a High-Yield Savings Account?
There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question. You should put as much into a high-yield savings account as you comfortably can, while keeping enough funds in your checking account to cover day-to-day expenses. A general rule of thumb is to keep three to six months’ worth of living expenses (think rent/mortgage, food, car and insurance payments, bills and any other essential expenses) in a savings account.
If you’re just starting to save, however, try to set aside a little bit from every paycheck. Set up a direct deposit into a high-yield savings account so that a percentage of your income is automatically saved. The amount you set aside will depend on your income, expenses, debt and personal comfort level.
Before you open a savings account, make sure to check the policies related to withdrawals and transfers. If you need to draw from your savings for unexpected expenses or emergencies, you’ll want to make sure you can easily and quickly access the money you need, without having to pay fees.
How To Open a High-Yield Savings Account
You can typically complete a digital application to open a high-yield savings account online by following these five steps.
Create an account. Enter your email address and create a password, or log in if you’re a customer.
Provide personal and contact information. This typically includes your full name, mailing address and phone number.
Verify your identity. Give your Social Security number and date of birth, then provide a government-issued photo ID.
Submit your application. Both parties will provide the above details to open a joint account.
Make your opening deposit. Once approved, you can link another bank account as a funding source, send a check or cash or schedule a wire transfer or direct deposit to make a deposit. Funding options vary by account and institution.
How Can I Maximize My Savings With a High-Yield Savings Account?
High-yield savings accounts allow you to earn among the highest possible yields and access your cash at any time. To maximize your return, though, you’ll need to employ a few strategies.
1. Follow the Market
To earn the best possible yield, stay nimble. The rates you earn are influenced by the short-term rate, known as the federal funds rate, which is set by the Federal Reserve. Moreover, banks tend to offer lucrative options in order to attract more deposits.
“Rates fluctuate regularly, so it’s crucial to set regular calendar reminders, watch the Fed rate and monitor these investments to ensure your money is always working for you in the best possible way,” says Tim Nargassans, financial services executive and data/AI expert.
2. Save for a Purpose
It’s much easier to save with a goal in mind—such as a kitchen remodel—than saving for the sake of saving. To that end, you can open a series of high-yield savings accounts, each with its own purpose. The closer you get to meeting your savings goal in each account, the more likely you’ll be to keep going.
“Putting away money in multiple high-yield savings accounts associated with specific goals helps you hit your targets faster,” says Michelle Winterfield, co-founder and CEO of Tandem, a financial app for couples. “Not only are you isolating your savings into buckets, but you’re earning sizable interest while the money sits there.”
3. Embrace Restrictions
Many savings accounts, though not all, limit the number of withdrawals you can make in a month without paying a fee. This can feel like a burden to some, but it can be a necessary limitation for those who struggle to stay within a budget.
“Since high-yield savings accounts frequently impose limitations on withdrawals, [they] introduce a gentle hurdle, prompting you to pause and consider the purpose behind accessing your savings,” says Megan McCoy, an accredited financial counselor (AFC®) and assistant professor at Kansas State University’s Department of Personal Financial Planning. “This safeguard encourages thoughtful deliberation before tapping into funds you should be setting aside for future goals.”
Alternatives to High-Yield Savings Accounts
If a high-yield savings account (HYSA) doesn’t seem like a good fit for your money, consider the following alternatives:

Methodology
What do people want in a high-yield savings account? We commissioned a poll of 2,000 American adults to find out.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, the top concern is high interest rates. However, the survey revealed other insights. We applied the survey’s results to create the methodology we use to rate hundreds of savings accounts.
Here are the factors we considered, and the weight we gave to each:
APY: 40%
Trust: 25%
Insurance: 10%
Total deposits: 5%
iOS app rating: 3%
Google Play app rating: 3%
Years in operation: 2%
Trustpilot rating: 1%
BBB rating: 1%
Access: 15%
Live chat: 5%
Mobile check deposit: 5%
Number of in-network ATMs: 3%
Available branches: 2%
Fees: 15%
Monthly maintenance: 10%
Overdraft: 2.5%
Wire transfer: 2.5%
Minimum balance requirement: 2.5%
Amount required to waive monthly fee: 2.5%
Our aim is to highlight banks anyone across the country can use, but we don’t showcase accounts that impose high balance minimums to either open or maintain an account. Minimum deposit requirements of $10,000 or higher affected scores negatively, as did high minimum balance requirements to avoid fees.
We crafted this list of best high-yield savings accounts by analyzing 370 savings accounts from 157 financial institutions, including a mix of traditional brick-and-mortar banks, online banks, credit unions and fintechs.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
Are high-yield savings accounts safe?
Yes, high-yield savings accounts are safe because they typically include insurance and security features. The FDIC and NCUA protect deposits at insured institutions so customers don’t lose their money in the event of failure, with a standard coverage limit of $250,000 per depositor.
Financial institutions commonly take several other measures to protect users’ personal and financial information. Multifactor authentication, fraud monitoring, data encryption and confidential storage methods are widely used safeguards that keep data secure against cyberattacks and threats. You should also take your own steps to protect your banking information, such as using strong passwords and monitoring your accounts for suspicious activity.
When is it time for a new savings account?
No one wants to spend more time than absolutely necessary figuring out their banking needs. Still, every so often it pays to consider switching banks, at least when it comes to your savings.
Here are three times when it makes sense to open a new account:
Your rate is really low. Some folks haven’t looked at the rate offered by their savings account since the Fed began raising interest rates. Take a look at yours, and see if it’s close to our best picks. If not, opt for one of them.
You want to focus your savings. As mentioned above, opening a savings account for a specific purpose (a kitchen redo, for example) can help you discipline your spending so that you meet your savings goals.
You’re paying too much in fees. Many savings accounts, including our winners, offer high yields and low fees. If you’re getting nickel-and-dimed (check your monthly statement to see), close your account and move your business elsewhere.
How do you calculate interest on a high-yield savings account?
To calculate interest on a high-yield savings account, you’ll need to calculate compound interest, or interest earned on interest. The easiest way to do this is with a compound interest calculator. This uses a formula that factors in an account’s balance, amount of time interest is compounded, earning rate, compounding frequency and ongoing deposits. Savings accounts often make monthly interest payments.
How many high-yield savings accounts can I open?
You can have as many savings accounts as you want, but you might not be allowed to open multiple accounts of the same type with one bank. Keeping savings accounts with different institutions can be a smart strategy for taking advantage of the best rates and features anyway, but always be mindful of insurance coverage limits, fees and minimum balance requirements.
Which high-yield savings account has a 7% interest rate?
These days, you won’t find any high-yield savings accounts that offer 7% APY. The highest yields you’ll come across are close to 5%. With rates slowly trending downward, it might be a while until financial institutions start offering interest rates anywhere close to 7%.
