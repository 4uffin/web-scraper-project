Editor's Take
We picked the Axos Bank Business Interest Checking account as the best overall business checking account because it offers several free business services and earns competitive interest. It also comes with access to dedicated Axos Bank relationship managers.
Another Axos account, Basic Business Checking, also ranked at the top of our list. Basic Business Checking supports unlimited fee-free transactions, reimburses customers for all out-of-network ATM fees and charges no monthly fee. Though it doesn’t pay interest on balances, this account also offers a robust suite of business banking services.
Why We Like It
We like the Business Interest Checking account because it includes unlimited domestic ATM reimbursements for third-party ATMs and discounted business services through partners Celero and ADP. And, of course, it earns up to 1.01% APY on balances below $50,000.
What We Don’t Like
We don’t like that this account carries a $10 monthly fee and has a low remote deposit limit of 60 items per month. It also only earns the best interest rate on balances below $50,000.
Who It’s Best For
Axos Business Interest Checking is best for business owners open to using Axos’ service partners who plan to keep between $5,000 and $50,000 in the bank.
Pros & Cons
Potential to earn relatively high APY
Low minimum deposit requirement
Unlimited domestic ATM reimbursements
Compatible with QuickBooks
Monthly service fee and balance requirement to waive
No physical bank branches
Fees for paper statements, checks and outgoing wire transfers
Monthly remote deposit limit
Details
Axos Business Interest Checking earns up to 1.01% APY on balances below $50,000, 0.20% APY on balances between $50,000 and $249,999.99 and 0.10% APY on all other balances. The account limits free remote deposits to 60 items per month and a monthly processing limit of 100, including remote deposits. This account offers a complimentary starter set of paper checks.
Dedicated banking relationship managers are available Monday through Friday. This account charges fees for paper statements, checks and outgoing wire transfers. Axos also offers business savings accounts, a business money market account, a nonprofit money market account, business CDs and loans. Merchant services are provided through a partnership with Celero Merchant Solutions. Payroll services are provided through a partnership with Roll by ADP.
Bonus
Axos offers a cash bonus of up to $400 when opening an account and meeting certain requirements by September 30, 2025, using offer code NEW400. To qualify, you must make a deposit within 30 days of opening your new account, and your balance will be used to determine the amount of your bonus. To earn up to $400—which is paid as $100 for up to four statement cycles—you will need to have an average balance above $50,000 in your new account, a minimum of 10 POS transactions of at least $3 each posted to your account each month and bill pay set up for your account. You need to submit an application by September 30, 2025 to qualify.

Editor's Take
We picked the First Internet Bank Do More Business™ Checking account because it earns interest and includes perks like unlimited transactions and $10 in monthly ATM reimbursements. It’s also one of the only competitive business checking accounts without a monthly fee.
Another account at First Internet Bank, the Commercial Premium Checking account, also ranked near the top of our list. This account is an excellent option for businesses that have a higher amount of transactions and more complex banking needs.
Why We Like It
We like the Do More Business checking account because instead of paying the best interest rate on smaller balances, as many business checking accounts do, it pays 0.50% APY for accounts with an average daily balance of $10,000.
What We Don’t Like
We don’t like that balances below $10,000 don’t earn interest with this account. First Internet Bank also doesn’t have its own ATM network or partner with an existing network, so business owners may have trouble staying under the out-of-network reimbursement limit.
Who It’s Best For
The First Internet Bank Do More Business Checking account is best for mature businesses that keep larger balances in the bank and transact often, but it could also meet the needs of smaller businesses with less to deposit.
Pros & Cons
Interest on checking balances of at least $10,000
Monthly ATM fee reimbursement of up to $10
No monthly maintenance fee
Several deposit accounts are available
No physical bank branches
$10,000 minimum balance to earn interest
No ATM network or partner network
Details
Interest for this account is compounded and credited monthly on the last day of each month. The Do More Business Checking account has no minimum deposit, balance or monthly maintenance fee. Regardless of your balance, you will be reimbursed up to $10 per month in ATM fees. First Internet Bank also offers several business deposit accounts, including a savings account, money market account and CDs.
Bonus
The First Internet Bank Do More Business Checking account does not have active sign-up or referral bonuses at this time.
Best for Startups + Full-Service Online Banking

Editor's Take
We chose the NBKC Bank Business Checking Account because it doesn’t have fees or minimums, making it friendly to small businesses and startups without a lot of capital. NBKC also stands out as a full-service digital bank.
Why We Like It
We like that this free account helps business owners save time and money. It doesn’t charge fees found with many business bank accounts or require owners to maintain a certain balance or activity level to get the most benefit. We also like that NBKC offers many business accounts, lending options and payment solutions so small businesses can grow without switching banks.
What We Don’t Like
Although the NBKC online platform and mobile app are user-friendly, they’re more basic than offerings from other banks and don’t have many business-specific tools for budgeting and accounting.
Who It’s Best For
The NBKC Bank Business Checking Account is best for smaller businesses that want to save on banking and have the flexibility to let their balances fluctuate. It’s ideal for those without complicated money management or app integration needs.
Pros & Cons
Some branch locations
Very few fees, including no monthly maintenance fee
No minimum deposit is required to open an account
Up to $12 per month in out-of-network ATM fee refunds
No physical bank branches outside of Kansas and Missouri
Fees for international (incoming and outgoing) and outgoing domestic wire transfers
Only one type of checking account
Details
NBKC Bank offers a single mobile app for both business and personal banking. The account offers surcharge-free ATM access at over 37,000 MoneyPass ATMs. If you need to use an out-of-network ATM that charges a fee, NBKC refunds up to $12 per statement period. In addition to a free business checking account, NBKC Bank offers business savings deposit accounts—both money market accounts and certificates of deposit (CDs)—business loans and lines of credit, and business solutions including cash management, fraud management, collections and disbursement services.
Bonus
The NBKC Bank Business Checking Account does not have active sign-up or referral bonuses at this time.

Editor's Take
We chose the PNC Bank Treasury Enterprise Plan because it includes a high monthly transaction limit of 2,500 and allows businesses to deposit $50,000 in cash monthly with no additional charge. This account also has investment options for excess cash with the ability to set up an automatic sweep into a money market account for balances over a minimum you set.
PNC offers two other accounts that scored well in our ranking: The Business Checking and Business Checking Plus accounts are both worth considering if your business doesn’t need the transaction volume or cash deposits our top pick offers.
All three of these accounts include no ATM fees at PNC Bank ATMs, no setup fee for overdraft protection, free online banking, free bill pay and cash-back rewards through PNC Purchase Payback. Cash-back promotions change often and vary by location but may help you save on business spending.
Why We Like It
We like this account not just for the rewards but also because it permits businesses to deposit up to $50,000 in cash fee-free each month and has one of the highest monthly transaction limits of any bank we reviewed. If you operate a business that handles a large volume of transactions and cash every month, you’ll be hard-pressed to find a better account for your needs than PNC Bank’s Treasury Enterprise Plan.
What We Don’t Like
On the list of things we don’t like, this account’s $50 monthly fee is at the top. And while it is waivable, the requirements to avoid it may be too high for small businesses. PNC Bank also requires some business owners to visit a branch to finish opening their accounts.
Who It’s Best For
PNC Treasury Enterprise Plan is best for established businesses with high deposit and transaction volumes. While PNC Bank offers mobile and digital banking, this account may be best suited for business owners who prefer banking at a branch.
Pros & Cons
Allows 2,500 transactions per month
Make $50,000 in cash deposits monthly with no fee
Option to autosweep to a money market account for higher interest earnings.
Cash back at select retailers
Branches in 28 states and Washington, D.C.
High balance requirement ($30,000) to waive monthly maintenance fee
Fees to sync with accounting software like QuickBooks
High fees for over-the-limit transactions
High overdraft, out-of-network ATM and other service fees
Details
PNC Treasury Enterprise Plan is a non-interest-bearing account. The first 2,500 transactions (including deposits, paid items and ACH transfers) and $50,000 in cash deposits are free each month.
The $50 monthly account maintenance fee can be waived by maintaining a $30,000 average monthly collected balance between the primary and all beneficiary business checking accounts. This account carries a number of incidental fees you may be charged. PNC Bank has branches in 28 states.
Bonus
The Treasury Enterprise plan currently offers a $1,000 bonus if you maintain an average balance of $30,000 or more for each of the first three statement cycles. To earn this bonus, you must open the account by September 30, 2025.

Editor's Take
The BMO Digital Business Checking account has a monthly fee, but it can be waived by maintaining a low minimum average balance. The account allows unlimited incoming ACH transactions and incoming wire transfers.
The BMO Premium Business Checking account also ranked high on our list and allows up to 200 free transactions per statement period and up to $5,000 in fee-free cash deposits per statement period.
Why We Like It
We like that the BMO Digital Business Checking account’s relatively low monthly maintenance fee can be waived by maintaining an average balance of $500 per statement period. The account also allows unlimited free incoming ACH transactions and incoming wire payments. Customers also have access to 40,000+ fee-free ATMs.
What We Don’t Like
We don’t like that this account has a low fee-free deposit limit of $1,000 and charges 25 cents for every additional $100 deposited per statement period. Additionally, it does not pay interest on balances.
Who It’s Best For
This account is best for businesses that prefer to do most of their banking online and want to avoid high fees and high minimum deposit requirements.
Pros & Cons
Low monthly fee that can be waived
Low minimum deposit requirement
Unlimited ACH Transactions
40,000+ BMO and Allpoint ATMs nationwide
Only $1,000 in fee-free cash deposits per statement period
$15 overdraft fee
Details
This is a non-interest-bearing account. The monthly cash deposit limit is low at just $1,000, but customers can receive unlimited ACH or wire transfers. There is a $30 fee for domestic outgoing wire transfers and a $50 fee for international outgoing wire transfers. If you use an ATM outside of the 40,000+ BMO ATM network, a $3 fee will be charged.
Bonus
If you open a business checking account by January 28, 2026, you can receive a $350, $750 of $1,000 cash bonus.
To receive the $350 bonus: On Day 30, your account balance must be $4,000 or more; from Day 31 to Day 90, your account balance must be $4,000 or more. It cannot drop below $4,000 during this period.

Editor's Take
The KeyBank Basic Business Checking account, as well as the KeyBank Business Interest Checking account, ranked high on our list. Both accounts have a high fee-free deposit limit and allow unlimited ACH and bill pay transactions.
Why We Like It
We like that the KeyBank Basic Business Checking account allows up to 200 combined transactions each statement period and lets business owners deposit $25,000 in cash monthly with no added fees.

Editor's Take
The Regions Bank LifeGreen Business Checking account is a good option for smaller businesses with a low transaction volume that want to sidestep monthly fees and high minimum deposit requirements. The account also comes with budgeting and savings tools.
Why We Like It
We like that the Regions Bank LifeGreen Business Checking account offers several attainable ways to waive its $12 fee: Maintain an average monthly balance of $500, make at least $1,000 in any combination of Regions Visa Business Debit Card or Business Credit Card purchases or have at least one Regions Merchant Services transaction credited to your account.
It also offers the choice of either the Regions iTreasury Small Business cash management package or Regions Online Banking for Business, both of which provide a secure way to manage your business’s cash flow.
What We Don’t Like
This account allows only 150 transaction items per statement period, which could be an issue for businesses with higher transaction activity. The fee-free monthly limit for cash deposits is somewhat low, too, at $5,000.
Who it’s best for
It’s suitable for small businesses that don’t want to be restricted by high minimum balance requirements and don’t have high transaction activity.
Pros & Cons
Low minimum deposit requirement
Easy to waive monthly fee
Budgeting tools through My GreenInsights
Earn cash back with Regions Offers
Low transaction limit
Branches only located in 15 states
Does not pay interest
Does not offer free incoming wire transfers
Details
LifeGreen Business Checking is one of four business checking accounts offered by Regions Bank. Of the three accounts that charge a monthly fee, this account has the easiest-to-meet requirements to waive the fee. Regions’ ATM network is small compared to many of the others on our list, and includes about 2,000 fee-free ATMs. If you use an out-of-network ATM, you’ll face a $3 fee. For cash deposits over $5,000 per month, you’ll pay 25 cents per $100 and you’ll also pay 50 cents for each additional item in excess of 150 transactions.
Bonus
Regions has a Refer-a-Friend program, through which you could earn $150 by referring another small business.
To earn the $150, the referred business must register for the program using the referral email or in a branch and then open a new Regions business checking account and deposit at least $500 the day the account is opened. Within 60 days of opening the new account, the referred business must make at least one Visa Business Debit Card purchase and enroll in online statements. You can earn up to $500 a year through referrals.

Editor's Take
Novo has many of the common features you’d expect from a top business bank account, like no monthly maintenance fee and no minimum deposit requirement. What got Novo onto our list are the features that make it well-suited for e-commerce, including integration to Stripe, Square, Gusto and Etsy.
Why We Like It
We like Novo for its ability to connect and automate business processes with the apps you’re already using to run your business. You can take a payment in Stripe, update inventory in Sheets and pay your employee in Gusto, all while Novo integrates the data into your account.
What We Don’t Like
Similar to other online business accounts, Novo does not have physical locations and does have transaction limits. Unfortunately, these limits are opaque and specific to each business.
Novo currently has limits on ACH transfers, check deposits, ATM withdrawals and Point of Sale purchases, but to find out what these limits are you’ll have to open an account and find your limits in the “account info” section of the Novo App.
Novo also only offers customer service through their app or by email.
Who It’s Best For
Novo is best suited for e-commerce businesses or small businesses that are looking for an account that offers integration with the apps they already use.
Pros & Cons
No minimum deposit required
No monthly maintenance fees
Early payment options
Discounts on partner products
Unclear transaction limits
Unclear cash deposit ability or limits
Limited Customer Service options
Details
Novo is a banking platform, not a bank. Novo offers an Express ACH option for customers to get paid on the same day. However, this service comes with a charge of 1.5% of the transaction amount. Novo also offers discounts to customers on several partner products including $5,000 in waived Stripe processing fees, and three months free on Gusto.
Bonus
Novo does not currently offer a welcome bonus.

Editor's Take
The Relay Starter account ranked high on our list because it has very few fees and no minimum deposit requirement, and it comes equipped with bookkeeping functions to help you better manage your business.
The Relay Grow account also scored well, offering everything the Relay Starter account does, plus discounted fees for wires and same-day ACH transfers. This account charges a $30 monthly fee.
Why We Like It
Relay is a small-business banking and money management platform that allows businesses to create up to 20 checking accounts to categorize spending, issue up to 50 debit cards, integrate with QuickBooks Online and Xero and get a comprehensive overview of income and expenses, among other things.
We like the fact that this account charges no monthly or overdraft fees and has no minimum deposit requirement.
What We Don’t Like
Transaction limits are set individually for each customer. You must open an account to determine your limit.
Who It’s Best For
The Relay Starter account is best for businesses looking for an online expense management platform with minimal fees, especially larger businesses that want to organize cash and expenses across separate accounts or debit cards.
Pros & Cons
No monthly fee for Starter plan
No minimum deposit requirement
Ability to have multiple accounts and debit cards
Full money management platform with detailed banking data
Balances up to $3 million insured
Unclear transaction limits
Accounts payable features limited without paid plan
Details
Relay is a financial technology company and banking services and FDIC insurance are provided by Thread Bank. Relay’s Starter plan is free, but it also offers two paid plans: Grow for $30 per month and Scale for $120 per month. All three plans include the option to open two savings accounts. Starter savings accounts earn 1.03% APY; Grow savings accounts earn 1.75% APY and Scale savings accounts earn 3.03% APY.
Bonus
There are currently no bonus offers available for the Relay Business Checking account.

Editor's Take
Truist Community Checking is the only account on our list designed specifically for nonprofit organizations. The account is mostly fee-free for organizations with a low to moderate number of monthly transactions and has a low opening deposit requirement of $100.
Why We Like It
This account has no monthly fee, a low opening deposit requirement and supports unlimited cash processing at no charge.
What We Don’t Like
Only 225 free monthly transactions are allowed, and this includes ATM transactions, point-of-sale purchases, deposits, checks and incoming ACH transfers. If you exceed that amount, you’ll be charged a high fee of 35 cents per transaction. If you use an ATM outside of Truist’s network of about 3,000 ATMs, you’ll pay a fee of $3 per transaction.
Who It’s Best For
Truist Community Checking is best for small nonprofit organizations that want a low-cost checking account and don’t require a large amount of transactions per month.
Pros & Cons
No monthly fee
Unlimited free cash deposits
Low monthly transaction limit
Small network of fee-free ATMs
High charge for excess transactions
Details
This is a solid option for nonprofits with straightforward banking needs. Customers can easily manage their account online and receive multiple debit cards. Incoming domestic wire transfers cost $15 each, while outgoing transfers cost $20. For international wires, you’ll pay $20 or $35 per transaction, respectively. For ACH payments, you’ll pay $1 per transaction if you exceed the 15-per-month limit.
Bonus
Truist is not currently offering a welcome bonus for this account.

Methodology
Forbes Advisor analyzed 226 business checking accounts at 79 financial institutions, including traditional brick-and-mortar banks, online banks and credit unions, to find the best business checking accounts for you. We then weighted these offerings based on a series of factors to determine the top business checking account available:
Fees: 25%
Limits: 15%
Customer Experience: 15%
Features and Integrations: 10%
Minimums: 10%
Digital Experience: 10%
Access: 10%
APY: 5%
Fees (25%)
A checking account should first do no harm, and that means charging little in fees. We took a broad view of potential penalties for your small business, taking into account monthly fees (as well as your ability to avoid them), excess transaction fees, overdraft fees, ATM fees and deposit fees.
Limits (15%)
We prefer accounts that make it easy for you to operate your business checking account, and that means imposing few restrictions on the number of transactions you can make or the amount of cash you can deposit.
Customer Experience (15%)
You’ll inevitably need assistance with some banking issue at some point, which is why we rated customer experience so highly. The ranking consists of how well a particular bank scores at the Better Business Bureau and Trustpilot, as well as if customers can chat with a customer representative online.
Features and Integrations (10%)
We want checking accounts with bells and whistles that make it easier to run your business. That’s why we determined whether accounts integrate with accounting, payroll, invoicing and tax prep software, among other services. We also gave high marks to accounts that offered merchant services, meaning they could process point-of-sale payments.
Minimums (10%)
We want banks that make it simple to open an account and keep it going without imposing huge cash conditions. Therefore, we gauged the minimum deposit requirement and the minimum amount required to open an account.
Digital Experience (10%)
Mobile banking is the norm, and so we wanted to see how well financial institutions ran the bank in your pocket. To that end, we looked at their scores on Google Play and the App Store.
Access (10%)
While online banking is a key component of business banking, we also wanted to reward banks that provide physical locations through access to ATMs and traditional branches. To appear on this list, the business checking account must be nationally available.
APY (5%)
While the point of a checking account isn’t to earn interest, we wanted to give extra points for those accounts that provide a solid yield.
We constantly update rates for our winners so that they are up to date. To learn more about our rating and review methodology and editorial process, check out our guide on How Forbes Advisor Reviews Banks.
What Is a Business Checking Account?
A business checking account is a place to deposit and keep your business funds, as well as pay the bills your business incurs. It works similarly to a personal checking account in that both products are a convenient way to administer sizable amounts of cash and transfer it to other entities.
You can make deposits and withdrawals, process ACH payments, write checks and use a debit card to access cash from ATMs and make purchases.
The big difference, of course, is that a business checking account holds money for your business, whereas a personal checking account holds money for your personal expenses.
But there are other important distinctions, too.
For instance, business checking accounts can impose limits and fees on the number of transactions you can make in a month and how much cash you can deposit.
Many also integrate with business-related software, such as payroll and tax services, to make it easier for small businesses to keep their books.
Therefore, it’s important that you determine the relative positives and negatives of a given account before making a decision.
How Does a Business Checking Account Work?
Business checking accounts are designed for all types of businesses, including limited liability companies (LLCs), sole proprietors, corporations and partnerships
You can open a business checking account if you’re a self-employed contractor or if you’ve got a 10,000-employee software company.
All can benefit from helpful features that make your life a little easier and separate your personal finances from those of your business.
Is a Business Checking Account Right for You?
Regardless of how big your business is or how long it’s been in operation, you almost certainly need a business checking account. This is especially true for all small businesses, including sole proprietors, partnerships and corporations. If you’re seeking any of the following solutions, a business checking account is likely right for you.
You want to separate your business and personal affairs. It is harder to track the performance of your business if you keep all of your money in one place. Simplify your life by using different accounts.
You want to streamline accounting and tax-filing. By using different accounts for personal and professional purposes, you’ll have a far easier time reconciling your finances—and making sure Uncle Sam gets his cut.
You want some liability protection. A business bank account provides LLCs with personal protection if they face legal actions, though sole proprietors don’t qualify for this benefit. If you’re concerned about liability, consider becoming an LLC.
You want additional insurance. As with personal checking accounts, you’ll receive $250,000 in deposit insurance (per account type) from federally insured banks or credit unions. That’s in addition to the $250,000 you receive in your personal capacity unless you are a sole proprietor, in which case it is combined.
Since many of the best business checking accounts featured above are free, there’s no reason not to open one for your business, especially as having a strong relationship with a bank could result in access to a business credit card or business line of credit if needed in the future.
Pro Tip
If you have a side gig or are a small business without employees, it might feel like a burden to open and maintain a checking account for your business. But there’s a reason why both the FDIC and IRS recommend you do so. If nothing else, it’ll make tax time much easier. Wouldn’t you like to ease that headache?
How To Choose a Business Checking Account
Begin by prioritizing the terms and conditions that are important to your business, and then see which of our best business checking accounts are most suitable for you.
Fees. Consider monthly maintenance fees (including how easy it is to avoid them), out-of-network ATM fees or transaction fees that are volume-based.
Pro Tip
Compare overdraft protection options and fees to safeguard your business from potential overdrafts. Consider linked savings accounts, lines of credit or overdraft protection programs that fit your risk tolerance and financial needs.
Minimums. Pay attention to the minimum deposit requirements to open and maintain your account or earn a higher yield on your cash.
Limits. Determine the number of transactions you can make without paying a fee, as well as the amount of cash you’re allowed to deposit or withdraw.
APY. Businesses that keep a fair amount of cash in their checking account should take into account the APY that’s offered by a prospective bank.
Customer Service. Prioritize those banks and credit unions that offer dedicated specialists to address your concerns, as well as those with good scores from independent sources, such as the Better Business Bureau.
Account Features. You’ll want accounts that allow you to sync with a payroll or tax preparation service.
How you land on which bank account is best for you depends on your particular business needs.
Is a High-Yield Business Checking Account Worth It?
A high-yield business checking account is worth your consideration if the account’s other attributes line up with your needs.
As you can see by our methodology, we don’t think yield should be one of your top priorities when determining which account to use. You should instead prioritize features like fees and customer service.
A high APY is a nice-to-have, but not a requirement for a great business checking account. If you’re primarily interested in earning the best yield, you should probably be looking for a business savings account instead.
– Taylor Tepper, senior banking writer
That being said, a high-yield checking account could make for a good tie-breaker, especially if you keep a considerable amount of cash in your checking account.
Should you opt for a checking account based, at least in part, on its yield, make sure you review the account terms carefully. Often banks will make you jump through hoops, such as keeping a certain balance or making a given number of transactions, to earn that rate.

How To Open a Business Checking Account
Once you’ve settled on the best business checking account for you, the process of opening it is pretty straightforward.
Either visit the financial institution’s website, call customer support or go to a branch to set up the account.
When you sign up for your account, you’ll likely need the following (though requirements vary by bank):
The IRS-issued employer identification number (EIN) or your Social Security number if you’re a sole proprietor
Business address and phone number
Names of people to be listed as account holders
Business formation documents, such as articles of incorporation
Government-issued photo ID, such as a driver’s license or passport
Business licenses
Partnership agreements
Initial deposit
Alternatives to Business Checking Accounts
Below are alternatives to a business checking account that might make more sense for your particular needs.
Business Checking vs. Business Savings Accounts
If you value a business checking account yield more than we did in our analysis, you might actually be in the market for a business savings account. These accounts are best used for specific savings goals, such as taxes, emergencies and employee benefits.
Business savings accounts typically pay higher yields than checking accounts, though you typically won’t have access to debit cards. Some may offer an ATM card you can use to withdraw funds but not make purchases.
If you don’t need access to the funds on a daily basis, consider putting them in a business savings account. Otherwise, you’re better off with a business checking account.
Business Checking vs. Personal Checking Accounts
This distinction is relatively straightforward: You should use your business checking account for your business transactions, and you should use a personal checking account for your normal day-to-day financial management.
You want to separate your business transactions from your personal ones for a variety of reasons, including for bookkeeping and tax purposes. It’s just much easier to keep track of what you owe Uncle Sam if you know how much you earned and what your expenses were.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
Can you open a business checking account online?
Yes, most business checking accounts allow you to submit an online application and provide the required personal and business information without seeing anyone in person. You’ll then make your initial deposit, which will mean linking an external account if opening with a new bank.
How can I get a business checking account with bad credit?
Banks typically don’t require a credit check to open a business checking account, but they may pull your ChexSystems report to see how you’ve managed bank accounts in the past.
A ChexSystems consumer disclosure report is a record of your banking history and helps financial institutions assess your risk as a potential bank account holder. For instance, do you have any unpaid bank balances, or were your accounts closed due to mismanagement?
If you’re worried, request a copy of your ChexSystems report and ensure all the information is correct. You’re entitled to a free one every 12 months. If you spot a mistake, you can file a dispute to ChexSystems to get it fixed before opening a business checking account.
How many business checking accounts should I have?
The right number of business checking accounts for you depends on how you prefer to manage your business income and expenses. It may be a good idea to have at least one business checking account to deposit payments and pay expenses and a separate account to hold cash reserves.
Who needs a business checking account?
Whether you are a sole proprietor or a business owner with employees, your business needs a business checking account. For tax purposes, it’s important to separate your personal finances from your business finances right from the start. Even if you’re simply working a side hustle, having a business checking account speaks to your credibility and professionalism.
What banks offer free business checking accounts?
Some financial institutions offer free business checking accounts, meaning there are no monthly maintenance fees. Many of the financial institutions that offer free business checking are online-only banks that aren’t household names in banking. Some online-only banks that offer free business checking accounts include Axos, Bluevine and Novo.
How to close a business checking account ?
While you may be able to close a business checking account online, you might need to visit a branch or call the financial institution to close your account. Before shutting down an account and transferring your money elsewhere, make sure all pending transactions have cleared and that you’ve made other arrangements for scheduled payments and deposits. Also, remember to ask for written confirmation that the account has been closed.
How are business and personal checking accounts different?
Since you will be managing both your personal and your business checking accounts, it’s important to know their similarities and differences. While the accounts are similar, they may operate under different rules, fees and assumptions. With a business checking account, you likely will be handling a wider variety of transactions and the quality of your record-keeping matters more.
Can I open a business checking account without an EIN?
Yes. If your business is a sole proprietorship or single-person LLC, you can use your Social Security number—instead of an employer identification number—to open a business checking account. But if your business has employees or operates as a corporation or partnership, you will need an EIN.
What are the most important features of business checking accounts?
As is the case with any financial decision, the most important features of a business checking account will be specific to your business, your needs and your personal banking habits. Business-specific features you may want to consider include fees; integration with other accounting tools, e-commerce and payment capabilities; debit card security features; and ATM fee rebates.
