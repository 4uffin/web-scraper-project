Understanding Checking Accounts
Checking accounts are bank accounts used for everyday transactions and deposits. They usually come with a debit card, which can be used to make purchases or withdraw cash from an ATM. With a checking account, you can pay bills, receive direct deposits and transfer funds to other accounts.
Before opening a checking account, it’s essential to choose a product that best fits your financial needs.
Consider These Factors Before Opening a Checking Account
To ensure you’re opening the best checking account for your needs, consider several key factors.
Minimums: Some checking accounts require a minimum deposit to open an account. Others also have a minimum balance requirement that, if you fall under, will result in a fee.
Customer service: Customer service hours and options vary between institutions. Take a look and see if and when live agents are available for support, either by telephone or through live chat.
Digital experience: Before opting for a checking account, consider its mobile app ratings. Some apps can be confusing to navigate, making it hard to manage your accounts, while others feature an easy-to-use interface and provide additional features. Reading reviews can help you get a better understanding of the pros and cons of a bank’s online and mobile banking technology.
APY: APY varies widely between checking accounts, and many accounts offer no yield at all. Opting for an account with a high APY, in addition to low fees, can help you boost your earnings.
Safety: Only bank with institutions that provide FDIC or NCUA insurance, which covers up to $250,000 per depositor, per institution, for each account ownership category.
ATM Access: Consider the size of an institution’s ATM network and whether it waives fees or offers any reimbursements for both in-network and out-of-network ATMs.
Overdrafts: In many cases, if you overdraw your bank account, you’ll be charged a fee. However, many of the best checking accounts offer overdraft protection to help you prevent this from happening.
Fees: The best checking accounts don’t charge monthly maintenance fees. However, other fees you may encounter include wire transfer fees, stop payment fees, out-of-network ATM fees and overdraft fees.
Pro Tip
While an interest-bearing checking account is ideal, if it charges monthly fees, those can cancel out any interest you earn. If you’re not certain you’ll qualify for a fee waiver each month, opt for a free checking account and use an online savings account to earn interest. High-yield savings accounts are more likely to earn competitive interest rates without any balance requirements.
When a Checking Account Might Not Be Ideal
A checking account may not always be the best fit for your specific financial needs, so it’s important to weigh the pros and cons and consider account alternatives.
Pros:
Checking accounts offer easy access to your money
With a checking account, you can easily accept electronic deposits and make electronic payments or withdrawals, including at ATMs
Cons:

How Many Checking Accounts Should You Have?
There’s no limit to the number of checking accounts you have, and whether or not you need multiple checking accounts depends on your financial situation. Typically, however, you’ll need just one checking account, or if you have a partner, you’ll likely need three accounts—a joint checking account for you and your spouse, as well as separate checking accounts for each of you.
If you plan on carrying balances over $250,000, it’s wise to open multiple accounts and distribute your cash among them. This is because FDIC insurance only covers up to $250,000 per account. Therefore, splitting your cash across accounts can help ensure all your money is covered in the event of a bank failure.
Multiple checking accounts can also keep business and personal finances separate, help you organize transactions and earn checking account bonuses. However, having multiple accounts can be challenging to keep up with.
Alternatives to Checking Accounts
A checking account might not be the best fit for all of your financial needs. There are several alternatives to checking accounts that are worth considering.
Money market accounts: Money market accounts combine the earning potential of a savings account with the convenience of a checking account. The best money market accounts offer high yields and also come with a debit or ATM card, as well as check-writing capabilities, allowing for easy access to funds through spending or withdrawals.
High-yield savings accounts: Instead of saving all your cash in a checking account, opening a high-yield savings account can help you maximize your savings. The best high-yield savings accounts offer competitive APYs and have no monthly fees to eat into any interest earned.
Methodology
To create this list, Forbes Advisor analyzed 362 checking accounts at 138 financial institutions, including a mix of traditional brick-and-mortar banks, online banks and credit unions. We ranked each account on 18 data points within the categories of fees, access, customer experience, digital experience, minimums and APY. The following is the weighting assigned to each category:
Fees: 48%
APY: 5%
Branch and ATM access: 15%
Customer experience: 16.66%
Digital experience: 5.33%
Minimums: 10%
Fees: We graded an account’s monthly maintenance fee and overdraft fees. We assigned a higher rating to banks that offer the option to waive an additional fee.
APY: We evaluated any interest rate being offered by the bank on a given checking account.
Branch and ATM access: We looked at a bank’s ATM network and branches.
Customer Experience: We graded an account’s Trustpilot and BBB ratings.
Digital experience: We considered the Apple App Store rating and Google Play rating for each of the accounts reviewed.
Minimums: We factored minimum deposit requirements and minimum balance requirements to avoid a monthly fee in this category.
The point is to give you a true sense of what it’s like to use this product. To appear on this list, the checking account must be nationally available. To learn more about our rating and review methodology and editorial process, check out our guide on how Forbes Advisor reviews banks.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
How do I get a checking account bonus?
Some checking accounts offer bonuses for new customers, which can help you earn quite a bit of extra cash. To earn an account bonus, you’ll have to meet specific requirements. Typically, you’ll be required to receive a direct deposit of a certain amount within a specific time frame to be eligible. The best bank bonuses range from hundreds to thousands of dollars.
What is overdraft protection?
If you overdraw your bank account, you’ll typically be charged a fee. However, many of the best checking accounts offer overdraft protection. Overdraft protection allows transactions to clear if you don’t have enough money in your account to cover them. This service often comes with a fee.
Can you be denied a checking account?
Yes. You can be denied a checking account. When applying for an account, many institutions check your banking history through consumer reporting agencies, such as ChexSystems. If you have a negative banking history, you can be turned down for an account. Some banks offer second-chance checking accounts designed for individuals with a poor banking history as an alternative to standard checking accounts.
Does opening and closing checking accounts affect your credit score?
Typically, opening and closing a checking account does not affect your credit score. However, if you sign up for overdraft protection, your bank may make a hard credit inquiry, which could negatively impact your credit score. Overdrawing your account can also harm your credit score.
