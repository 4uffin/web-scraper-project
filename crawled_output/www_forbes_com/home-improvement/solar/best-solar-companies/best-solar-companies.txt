Momentum Solar has been around for 15 years and focuses on being a one-stop shop for solar where customers will have one point of contact during their entire journey. The company serves coverage areas in 12 states. Customers can choose from solar leases, loans and cash options, and the company outlines each financing option well on its website.Learn more: Momentum Solar review	Why We Picked ItMomentum Solar seems to take a white-glove approach to solar, aiming for a concierge experience with its solar installation. This involves customers having a primary contact within the company but also extends post-installation thanks to its Momentum Solar App, which allows customers to track their energy production.Why We Like ItLike many companies on our list, Momentum Solar’s panels have a 25-year equipment guarantee, but we also like that the company goes above and beyond by offering a 25-year workmanship warranty and a roof penetration warranty for five years that protects the area of the roof where the solar panels are. We also like that it offers Enphase battery storage.What We Don’t LikeMomentum Solar’s website has some good content on it, but a lot of it is a bit vague—it’s unclear on details about what panels it sells, and trying to find warranty info requires a bit of digging. The company also doesn’t have a power purchase agreement (PPA) option.Who It’s Best ForMomentum Solar can be a good choice for those in its service area who want streamlined communication with their solar company.	Pros & ConsFairly long warrantiesRoof coverageConcierge approachNo specific panel information on company websiteNo PPA option	Customer SurveyWe surveyed 1,000 solar customers who have installed systems in the last five years and found that customers had some mixed reviews of Momentum Solar. For instance, 74% of respondents who worked with the company said they’d recommend the company to a friend and 72% said they were happy with the company’s pre-installation customer service.

Blue Raven Solar has been in business for over a decade and is now owned by Complete Solar after previously being under the SunPower umbrella. The company offers services in 19 states, and one of its biggest draws is its policies of no money down installations that delay payments for solar customers.Learn more: Blue Raven Solar review	Why We Picked ItBlue Raven customers can enjoy no permitting, installation or design costs for 18 months, which can help you get ahead on any future payments while still saving money with solar. The company also has a production guarantee for the first 18 months of service. Blue Raven has a robust website with information on its offerings, as well as live customer chat.Why We Like ItBlue Raven has fairly decent customer reviews and a reputation of working with highly rated solar companies. We also appreciate that it has a referral program, currently offering a $1,500 referral bonus for every future customer you refer who installs a system with the company.What We Don’t LikeBlue Raven Solar doesn’t offer any leases or PPAs, and its website doesn’t give any information on which brands of panels it offers. The company doesn’t offer roofing services alongside solar, which is something we like to see.Who It’s Best ForBlue Raven can be a good choice for those who are concerned about the upfront prices of solar and could use some breathing room to get started.	Pros & ConsDelays solar payments for customers for 18 monthsRobust referral bonusLive chatNo leases or PPAsNo roofing services	Customer SurveyIn our survey of 1,000 solar customers who have installed systems in the last five years, there were some interesting insights about Blue Raven, including the fact that the company had the biggest share of customers who already had their systems paid off, at 36%. Overall, customers seemed fairly mixed to positive with their feedback on the company. When asked, 78% of customers said they were satisfied with the company’s post-installation customer service, but 42% rated the likelihood of recommending the company to a friend or family member as a 10 out of 10, which was tied for the highest percentage of any company.

Qcells is the first solar manufacturer on our list and provides high-quality solar panels to many installers that we ranked as well. The company offers a large variety of solar panel sizes, types and colors for residential and commercial solar system projects. You can install Qcells solar panels in any state, and its products are available around the world.Learn more: Qcells Solar review	Why We Picked ItQcells is one of the biggest names in solar and has been in business for 26 years. The company produces solar panels that top 22% efficiency, which is one of the best rates on the residential market. The company also sells solar batteries and home energy software so you can make sure everything is running smoothly.Why We Like ItThe company provides various warranties on its panels and their performance, including those that reach up to 30 years.What We Don’t LikeIf you want to install Qcells solar panels specifically, you’ll need to find a solar installer near you that carries its panels, as the company doesn’t install them directly. However, if you fill out a form on the Qcells website, the company will match you with a verified third-party installer if there is one near you. Because of this, it’s vital to vet your panel installer as well, because service, workmanship warranties and other factors will vary.Who It’s Best ForQcells solar panels are best for those who want highly efficient panels. Installer experience can vary, but if the panels themselves are your main focus, this option can be a good one—just be sure to do your research on any installers you choose.	Pros & ConsHighly efficient panelsWarranties can be lengthyProvides solar batteries and energy software as wellThird-party installations only	Customer SurveyOur solar survey of 1,000 customers who have installed systems in the last five years, showed that customers seemed pretty happy with their Qcells solar systems. When asked, 88% of Qcells customers said they were happy with the panels’ durability and reliability. And this stands up, as 68%, one of the highest percentages on our list, said they haven’t had to make any repairs on their Qcells solar panels.

Elevation Solar started as strictly a solar company created by two real estate investors who were shocked by high energy prices. However, in the 11 years it’s been in business, the company has expanded from solely rooftop solar to additional home energy solutions, which it calls The Elevated Home. The company serves areas in five states: Arizona, California, Florida, Nevada and Texas.Learn more: Elevation Solar review	Why We Picked ItElevation takes a whole-home approach to energy efficiency and solar power, with services including energy monitoring and insulation in addition to solar energy and battery storage. The company also acquired Curb Energy in 2020 to add smart energy monitoring technology so you can ensure you’re using your panels and other energy-efficient upgrades to their fullest potential.Why We Like ItWe appreciate that the company offers a 10-year roof penetration warranty for the area where panels are installed and a 25-year labor warranty. We also like that Elevation has some good information on its website, from purchase terms to general solar info. Though the company doesn’t list specific panel information on its website, a rep informed our team that it offers many different types of solar brands.What We Don’t LikeWe found some seemingly outdated info on the company’s site, so we recommend asking specific questions on updated warranty policies and checking to see if you’re in its updated service area. The company also doesn’t offer in-house financing or PPAs, and the service area is fairly small.Who It’s Best ForElevation Solar is a good choice for those who want to take a holistic look at their home energy solutions, with the ability to make energy-efficient choices in addition to solar.	Pros & ConsEnergy-efficient upgrades available in addition to solarInstalls panels from various companiesGood monitoring technologyNo in-house financingSome outdated or confusing info on company website	Customer SurveyIn our survey of 1,000 solar customers who have installed systems in the last five years, Elevation Solar customers generally reported mixed feedback about the company. When prompted, 86% said they were pleased with their panels’ reliability and durability and 80% said they would recommend the company to friends and family.

Sunrun offers solar panel installation services in 17 states. If you live outside of this coverage area, you may still be able to install Sunrun panels via a partnership with a local installer. The company has been in business for nearly 20 years and since then has installed solar panels on more than 1 million homes.Learn more: Sunrun Solar review	Why We Picked ItThough there are many benefits to owning your solar system, if you opt for a lease or PPA through Sunrun you’ll have plenty of perks and options to make the plan work for you. For instance, you’ll have access to 24/7 proactive monitoring and free maintenance with leases and PPAs. If the company senses that panels aren’t up to snuff, it will send someone out and make any necessary repairs.Why We Like ItSunrun will help you design a system of solar panels, batteries and other items to ensure you’re harnessing the most power you can and backing up your home in the case of a power outage. We also like that it offers a mobile app where you can monitor your system, pay your bills and more, all in one place.What We Don’t LikeSunrun doesn’t make clear on its website which brands of panels it installs. Because of this, warranties, efficiency and other factors can vary by panel type. Although we like that the company offers perks for lease and PPA customers, those who buy their systems will have to opt into an optional Protection Plus Program to take advantage of perks like 24/7 system monitoring and free maintenance and repairs.Who It’s Best ForSunrun really shines when it comes to solar leases and PPA plans, with plenty of perks in addition to monitoring and payment all in one convenient app.	Pros & ConsExtra perks for leases and PPAsWide availability through partner installersSolar batteries and other accessories availableMay not be available everywhereUnclear which panels it installs	Customer SurveyWe conducted a survey of 1,000 solar customers who have installed systems in the last five years and found that Sunrun’s customers had fairly positive feedback. When asked, 24% of customers said they saved $120 per month or more on their electric bill, which was the second-highest share of a company in that category. Additionally, 80% of customers said they haven’t had to make any repairs on their systems, the highest percentage of any company on our list.

Trinity Solar has more than 30 years of experience in the solar world, installing more than 100,000 systems and 3 million solar panels over the decades. The company, which serves the East Coast primarily, offers free consultations and custom solar designs to help solar customers get the best system for their homes.	Why We Picked ItWe like that Trinity Solar handles a lot of the legwork for customers, including getting the necessary permits and utility approvals and ensuring installation complies with local regulations. You can also choose to buy your system outright or opt for loans, leases and power purchase agreements (PPAs), but these are all from third parties.Why We Like ItTrinity also offers extensive roofing services, and because so many solar installs require roofing repairs and replacements, it’s nice to have a company that can handle both tasks with ease. On the topics of both solar and roofing, the company offers many detailed resources to make sure customers understand the process, lingo and any issues that may arise. Though it works in various states, it’s also appealing that the company offers a community partner program to help support local nonprofits via referrals.What We Don’t LikeTrinity isn’t super forthcoming about what solar brands it installs, which can be tough for customers looking for specific brands. It’s also only available to install panels in 10 states and primarily serves the Eastern U.S. so many customers will be out of its service area.Who It’s Best ForTrinity Solar is best for those who want many different options for how they’ll pay for their solar panels.

Tesla may be more well-known for cars, but the company also has a sizable solar business. The company acquired SolarCity in 2016, creating Tesla Solar, which is most well-known for its solar roofs and Powerwall batteries, the latter of which uses similar technology to the power storage on its vehicles.Learn more: Tesla Solar review	Why We Picked ItTesla’s solar roofs are a draw for many who want to take advantage of solar energy, but may not like the look of solar panels. Even its solar panels are designed to be sleek, low-profile and blend in with your roof. Additionally, its Powerwall battery storage systems are popular in the industry and sold by many other companies. You can also monitor each with the Tesla app.Why We Like ItTesla offers solar price-matching for qualifying panels, which can be a plus for budget-savvy shoppers who are set on Tesla. The company’s panels have a reported efficiency range between 19.3% and 20.6%, though this isn’t plain to see on the company website. However, the Tesla Solar website is full of other helpful information on its solar products and solar energy generally.What We Don’t LikeThe company often uses third-party installers, meaning reviews will vary by location. However, these installers must be Tesla-certified. The company also no longer offers a PPA option to new customers. Though its manufacturer’s warranty is in line with industry standards, its comprehensive warranty is lower than many others on our list. Similarly, while its reported efficiency is fairly competitive, there are more efficient panels on the market.Who It’s Best ForTesla Solar can be a good option for those concerned with the aesthetics of their solar panels and for those who are interested in a solar roofing option.	Pros & ConsSolar roof option availableSleek panelsPrice-matchingNo PPA option for new customersShorter workmanship warranty than some competitorsYou can find more efficient panels on the market	Customer SurveyIn our survey of 1,000 solar customers who have installed systems in the last five years, Tesla got generally mixed to positive feedback. When asked, 76% said they found their solar panels to be reliable and durable. Additionally, 82% of respondents were happy with the company’s pre-installation customer service, and a similar percentage (84%) were satisfied with the customer service since installation.
How Much Do Solar Panels Cost?
On average, solar panels cost around $23,000 for an average, 8 kW solar system, without any incentives. However, the price you’ll pay will depend on many factors, most largely the size of your system. Solar systems cost $2.62 to $3.23 per watt, so it’s wise to estimate how large of a system you’d need to get the closest solar panel cost estimate. To get an even more customized picture, you should reach out to several solar companies for quotes.

When we asked solar customers how much they paid for their systems, the answers were largely split. The most common cost ranges were between $10,000 and $30,000, which made up around 60% of respondents.
Solar Panel Cost Factors
As with most home projects, your unique price will vary based on unique factors such as:
Type of solar panel: Premium solar panels may cost more than more standard panels, but with higher efficiency, they may save you money in the long run. Similarly, lower-profile solar panels may cost more, but have a higher return on investment (ROI) when selling your home compared to bulkier models. All of these cost factors are worth considering and discussing with a solar expert.
Number of solar panels: The size of your home, your energy needs and goals and other factors will determine how many solar panels you should install on your home, another area where a solar expert can help. That said, the more solar panels you add, the higher the upfront cost and the higher maintenance will likely be.
Labor and permitting: Labor costs can vary by installer, which is one of the reasons why it’s so important to get multiple quotes. Permit costs will vary depending on where you live, but you won’t have much control over them. Permits for solar panel installations are typically a few hundred dollars. We’ve seen labor and permit cost estimates anywhere from 7% to 25% of your total solar cost, so expect this to vary. However, according to our research, the average solar installation labor cost is around 55 cents per watt.
Batteries and other equipment: Battery storage, electric vehicle chargers and other solar add-ons can help increase the usefulness of your solar power, but they can also increase your costs. For instance, the average cost of a solar battery is around $13,000 with installation costs and before tax credits.
Payment method: Paying for your solar panels outright will likely cost the least in the long run but comes with the highest upfront costs. Loans can help keep upfront costs manageable but increase your total costs. As for leases and PPA programs, these will typically cost the least, but you won’t be able to take advantage of some of the biggest pros of solar, like tax credits, incentives and ROI on your home.
Other Home Projects That May Be Needed for Solar
Sometimes solar projects aren’t just about the panels. You may face additional tasks to make the most of your panels. A few examples include:
Tree trimming or removal: If trees are blocking the sun and obstructing your solar panels, experts may recommend trimming them or removing them entirely. Tree trimming can range from around $100 for a small job to hundreds of dollars for major trimming jobs spanning multiple trees. As for removal, you’ll typically pay hundreds of dollars, or even upwards of $1,000 to remove a large tree. Be sure to factor in these costs when considering your larger solar project.
Roof replacement or repair: You won’t be able to install solar panels on a badly damaged roof, so you might need to make some repairs or even perform a full replacement before adding solar panels. Small roofing repairs can cost a few hundred dollars, while full roof replacement can cost $11,500 for an average-size roof.

How To Pay for Solar Panels
Solar panels can be a big investment, so you’ll want to give some serious consideration to how you’ll pay for them. Paying for solar outright, applying for loans or opting for some kind of lease all have their pros and cons.
Cash
If you have the upfront money, you can pay for solar panels out of pocket. This method will cost the most initially, but you won’t need to worry about paying interest and other fees. By owning your solar system, you’ll also be able to take advantage of the federal solar Investment Tax Credit and any other incentives that require ownership.
Solar Loans
Solar loans are a common path to solar system ownership for many. Many installers can offer you in-house financing, or you may be able to or have to opt for a third-party lender. We recommend shopping around for the best rate and payment terms. For instance, some solar companies will offer 0% interest for a time so you can start earning money with your solar panels before needing to pay it back.
Solar loan APRs will vary depending on a lot of factors, including your downpayment (if you make one), your loan term, your solar system size and more. The range for interest rates can be vast—for instance, in our research we saw rates from 4% to nearly 40%, making it wise to shop around.
You may also opt for a different type of loan if you want to ensure you can claim the entirety of the solar tax credit. We always recommend speaking with a solar expert and a tax expert before agreeing to any loan to ensure you’re getting the best loan type, payment terms and APR for you.
Solar Leases
With solar leases, you’ll typically pay a monthly fee for use of solar panels a company will install on your home for a set period. You won’t own these panels, so you won’t be able to benefit from federal solar incentives or most local ones, but you also won’t have to maintain the panels. They also won’t typically stay on your home if you move, so you won’t benefit from any potential ROI. However, leased solar panels may still help you pay lower utility bills.
Solar PPAs are a type of solar lease you’ll sometimes see, but instead of paying a monthly fee for panels, you’ll pay by kWh of energy the panels produce.
Are Solar Panels Worth It?
Going solar can be worthwhile for many households, but it depends on a few factors. You’ll need to ensure you can afford a solar system that is big enough to account for your required energy needs. If you can replace your monthly energy costs, or greatly reduce them, then your system will begin to pay for itself, making your system worth it.
How Much Money You Can Save Going Solar
How much money you can save annually by going solar will vary a lot depending on the size of your system, how efficient it is, the weather in your area and your energy costs, just to name a few factors. Generally, it’s estimated that you can save between $100 and $125 per month on your energy bills by going solar, but that’s not a guarantee and will vary month to month and by household.
The Department of Energy shares helpful resources for all the considerations you’ll need to take into account when planning your solar cost savings. As the agency notes, it’s wise to ask any solar company you’re considering to help you calculate how much you can save, but we’d also recommend getting several opinions and looking into local energy costs and other factors to check their work before diving in.
How to Determine If You Should Go Solar
Going solar can be a great choice for many, but a better choice for some. Here are some factors that can make solar a bit more of a solid investment:
You live in a particularly sunny area: Solar panels will still produce some electricity on cloudy days, but they’ll work much better on a sunny day. If you live in an area that gets plentiful sunshine, solar may be all the more appealing for you.
Your area has good solar incentives: Some states, counties and cities can make solar more appealing thanks to incentives like waiving sales tax or property tax increases thanks to solar. If net metering is common in your area, this can also be a plus in favor of adding solar to your home.
Your roof is in good shape: If your roof has extensive damage, you’ll need to perform some repairs before or during solar installation. If you can skip these repairs, it can make solar cheaper and be more likely that your roof will stay in good shape under your solar panels.
Your home has unobstructed views of the sky: Solar panels should have unshaded, unobstructed views of the sun, so if you have obstacles in your home’s way, it can pose a challenge, Some, like trees, can be helped, but if you live in a very dense area with lots of shade from other homes or buildings, solar can be less enticing. However, solar experts can help you find the best angle and placement for your panels, so it’s always worth asking.
You can afford the upfront costs: Solar ownership can be the most beneficial for many homeowners, but it can often come with upfront costs. If you can swing a downpayment or installation fees, then solar can be a good choice. However, even if you can’t, you still have options, as many companies offer zero-down loans with delays in interest accruing.

Solar Panel Tax Credits and Incentives
One of the biggest perks of solar panels is that you can take advantage of the federal solar tax credit, along with any local incentives. Here’s a quick breakdown of how they work:
Federal Investment Tax Credit for Solar
The federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC) allows you to get 30% of your total solar system cost back as a one-time tax credit. That means if your total solar cost is $30,000, you’d get $9,000 back in tax credits.
There are a few things to note here: This tax credit can only be applied the year that you install the system and start operating it. You can also only claim the full credit if it’s less than what you owe in taxes–you can also roll over any remaining credit until it runs out as long as the policy remains active. You also need to own your system, not lease it, to qualify.
It’s also worth knowing this timeline—the credit is currently worth 30% of the installed system costs through 2032. It is set to reduce to 26% in 2033, and then lower to 22% in 2034 and then expire. Note that as of this writing, current legislation is being considered that would potentially end this credit early, so keep that in mind.
Net Metering
Net metering involves selling any excess energy your solar panels produce that your home doesn’t need back to the grid for credits. Typically, this will look like a credit back on your future energy bills, but every utility company and/or local jurisdiction handles it a bit differently. The solar company you work with should be well-versed on this subject, but we always recommend doing your own research.
Other Common Incentives
Solar experts in your area will be in the know about any solar incentives you may qualify for in your state, county or city. Some of the most common incentives include the elimination of sales taxes on the purchase of solar equipment and the elimination of property tax increases solely due to solar additions. These are subject to change and may require certain paperwork to ensure you qualify, so be sure to stay in the loop and ask plenty of questions to ensure you get the most for your money.
How to Pick the Best Solar Company for You
With so many solar companies out there, choosing the right one can be tricky. We recommend keeping the following factors in mind to help make the best decision for your home’s energy needs.
Check Reviews and Seek Out Referrals
Online reviews are only part of the picture, but they can help you find solar companies with the best reputation. Look not only at star ratings but also the volume of reviews and how the company responds to reviews both negative and positive.
Similarly, ask friends and neighbors for any referrals they can give you for companies they may have worked with or know about. Word of mouth from those you trust can be one of the best ways to find reputable solar installers. Bonus: Some solar companies have referral programs, which may help you both save.
Check their Credentials
Qualified solar companies often have licenses and certifications that can help ease your mind, such as being certified by the North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners. We recommend asking about any certifications your company holds and only considering vetted installers.
Look into Services
Do you need roofing repairs along with your solar installation? Need a company with in-house financing? These are great things to look for on company websites and to ask about. Cementing your must-have services early and filtering out any companies that don’t offer them right away can help save you time and frustration down the line. Similarly, it may sound obvious, but be sure the companies you’re considering install in your specific area and on your home type.
Get Multiple Quotes and Opinions
As with most services, we recommend comparison shopping when it comes to solar panels. Get quotes from multiple companies to assess things like panel type, costs, loan terms and more. Remember that comparing all of these won’t necessarily be apples to apples (for instance, one company may suggest higher-efficiency panels, but fewer panels than another company that suggests a larger system with lower efficiency), so be sure to take a holistic view.
Similarly, you should ask about the estimated payback period for the panels, i.e., how long it will take for the panels to save you enough money that they pay for themselves. Compare these between companies, but take it with a grain of salt. After all, panels may run into issues, the weather may take a turn for the cloudy or it may just generally take longer than the companies hope it will, so it’s good to get a wide estimate from a few companies.
Ask Plenty of Questions
While you’re meeting with different companies to comparison-shop, you should also be asking plenty of questions, both to vet the companies and to get a better understanding of the process. Below are examples of questions to get you started:
What brands and types of panels do you offer?
Do you sell solar battery storage as well?
Do you handle roof repairs in-house or through a third party?
How does financing work?
How long does the installation process take?
Can you walk me through the next steps and what installation days may look like?
Will you file for permits or will I? How about any local incentives?
The company rep’s answer to these questions and more will help you get a sense for their knowledge of solar as well as their communication style, both of which are important for any company you work with.

Understanding How Solar Works
At a high level, solar panels take power from the sun’s rays and convert them into energy to power your home. At a little deeper level, solar installers will add photovoltaic (PV) panels on and around your home to capture the sun’s rays as best they can. The PV cells on the panel will absorb the sun’s energy and create electrical charges that move in response to an internal electrical field in the cell.
From there, components will convert the direct-current (DC) electricity produced by modules and convert it to the alternating current (AC) electricity that your home can use to power your devices and electricity.
Solar Panel Installation Process
When you meet with a solar installer, a representative should walk you through the company’s specific design and installation process, but below, we’ll give you a high-level overview of how solar installation typically works.
Research solar installation companies and get multiple quotes: This process can help you get a sense for each company’s options and reputation and general expectations for how much power a solar installation can produce on your home. We suggest vetting at least three solar companies, depending on the availability in your area. Be sure to ask plenty of questions about their process and solar generally.
Pick a solar installer and finalize your design: A good solar company should help you create a custom design within your budget. They’ll help set your expectations on how much electricity your home needs, what your panels can produce and what you can save as well as how long installation might cost.
File for permits and ensure you qualify for incentives: Ask your chosen company if you should be filing the paperwork for permits and incentives and be sure you have everything you need to file for the ITC come tax season. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s SolarTRACE tool can help you set expectations for permitting timelines near you.
The solar company will make final assessments: By now, the solar company should have made sure your roof is in good condition for solar panels and made or arranged for any necessary repairs. If you need to clear or trim trees, they also should have noted that by this stage.
It’s time for installation: The company should schedule a date for installation to start and let you know how long it will take. Typically solar installation takes just a few days from start to finish, although larger systems may take longer, and smaller systems can be even quicker.
Solar Survey Insights
We conducted a survey of 1,000 solar customers who have installed systems in the last five years to get a better understanding of how homeowners feel about their systems, how the installation process went and more. Below are some of the biggest insights we learned from the survey:
A majority of respondents (64%) said they installed panels primarily to save on energy bills. As for how that’s paid off, 67% of our respondents said they save more than $50 per month, with 15% saying that they saved $120 or more monthly on their bills.
People seem generally happy with how their panels hold up and how they operate, with 31% of respondents rating the reliability and durability of their panels as a 10 out of 10 and 87% saying they were satisfied.
Many have already paid off their solar panels (24%), and a similar number seemed to have a fairly short expected payback period of two to three years.
A majority of respondents, 57%, said they’ve never had to repair their panels.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
What is a Tier-1 solar company?
The tier-1 rating for solar manufacturers is given by independent analysts and has to do with financial status, manufacturing practices and more. Generally speaking, solar panels that come from tier-1 manufacturers tend to be more durable and better quality, but we still recommend vetting these and all panels.
Will home insurance go up with solar panels?
You may see a small increase to your home insurance premium thanks to solar panels, as you’ll often need to raise your coverage limits. That said, where your solar panels are installed (whether on your roof or on a structure separate to your home) may make a difference. Some home insurance companies also won’t cover solar panels at all, so we always recommend asking about this aspect before installing.
How long do solar panels last?
Solar panels tend to have a lifespan of 25 years or more, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, which is why you’ll typically see warranties last for that amount of time. Your solar panels may last longer than that, but they will probably only work optimally for around 25 to 30 years.
Are solar panels susceptible to hail damage?
Small hail may not damage your solar panels, but large hail can, according to the Department of Energy. If you live in an area that often has large hail, the department has some tips for preventing damage, such as choosing stronger frames and smaller cell modules. We also recommend asking your solar installation company about this concern.
