Whether you’re buying, selling or building on, 2-10 Home Buyers Warranty has fantastic options for both homeowners and sellers. With a Simply Kitchen plan covering kitchen appliances for as low as $27 monthly, a $50 monthly Complete Home plan that expands protection to electrical systems and plumbing, and the Pinnacle Home plan, which covers all of the previous items and things like alarm systems, filters and pipes for $65 per month, 2-10 can cover most homeowners’ needs with one of the three plans.Learn more: 2-10 Home Buyers Warranty review	Why We Picked It2-10 Home Buyers Warranty offers three comprehensive plans that are also some of the most price-competitive in the home warranty space. What caught our eye in particular was that 2-10 helps home sellers boost the appeal of their homes by offering protections during the listing period. Some basic plans are as low as $32 per month, and service fees can range from $65 to $100, offering more price flexibility.Why We Like ItWe like that this home warranty company works for every type of homeowner—those who’ve just moved in, those enjoying their home or those ready to sell. Not only do home sellers have their own specific options under 2-10, but builders can also easily secure structural warranties for new builds on a soon-to-be forever home.What We Don’t LikeIt’s important to look closely at 2-10 Home Buyers Warranty’s cancellation policy, which may be too rigid for some. The policy cancellation cost starts at $25 for the first 30 days of being in the plan, but it increases to 10% of the plan cost after Day 30. We can appreciate that 2-10 allows customers to use their own contractors and technicians, but there is a pre-approval process and discrepancies in covering extra costs, which can make the repair process feel more complicated than it needs to be.Who It’s Best ForThose on a strict budget will love what 2-10 offers for a competitive rate compared to the industry average; 2-10 Home Buyers Warranty’s Simply Kitchen plan is offered for as low as $32 monthly.

2-10 Home Buyers Warranty has received largely negative feedback from customers. Dissatisfied customers express a range of issues, particularly with customer service and the company’s response times. Many are unhappy with denied claims, often citing pre-existing conditions as the reason, and lack of transparency in coverage limits. Some reports claim that contractors are unprofessional and unreliable with high fees for subpar repairs. A smaller number of customers indicate positive experiences, but the overall sentiment toward the company is negative.2-10 Home Buyer’s Warranty Customer SurveyAfter surveying 1,800 consumers about their experience with their home warranty service, our team found overall positive sentiments among those who have 2-10 Home Warranty. Generally, 86% of respondents said they would recommend 2-10 to a friend, and 88% said they rate the value of the service highly.
Pros & ConsAffordable in comparison with many other plansSpecial features for homeowners, buyers and sellersComprehensive list of additional coverage plansCancellation fee structure can be a dealbreaker for someExtra steps with approving your chosen contractor	Plans and CoverageIt’s important to note that while other home warranty companies offer a set monthly premium and set service fee per plan, 2-10’s pricing depends on the service fee level you choose to pay for. Service fees with 2-10 range from $65 to $100, and the monthly cost hinges on the service fee level. For example, for the Simply Kitchen plan, you may pay $32 monthly if you opt for the $100 service call fee, or if you want to pay a $65 service call fee for the same plan, you would pay closer to $41 monthly.Below, we’ve broken out the monthly fee tiers based on the service fees:

With nearly 30 years of experience in the home warranty industry, Home Warranty of America (HWA) offers two comprehensive plans—Select and Select Plus—which include protections for kitchen appliances like cooktops, ranges and dishwashers, while Select Plus expands coverage for air conditioning units as well as plumbing, heating and electrical systems.Learn more: Home Warranty of America review	Why We Picked ItHWA’s two plans, Select and Select Plus, offer broad coverage for basic household appliances and systems, but these plans go beyond the norm, covering niche home features like saltwater pools, second refrigerators and sprinkler systems, which earned it major points in our analysis.Why We Like ItWe appreciate that HWA offers homeowners two comprehensive plans for fairly competitive prices—about $46 monthly for the Select Plan and about $60 monthly for Select Plus. Homeowners won’t miss out on crucial coverage with the more basic plan. We also love that the company has a 30-day money-back guarantee policy and that its pricing structure is straightforward with no age restrictions on covered items (so both young and old homes can be easily covered by HWA).What We Don’t LikeThough HWA’s two plans include broader coverage of major systems, some homeowners might be looking for an appliances-only plan, which they won’t find with HWA. Also, you cannot choose your own contractor for repairs or replacements through HWA.Who It’s Best ForHWA is a great option for those who are not picky about plan type—they may just want a base plan for the whole home that covers common systems and appliances. If you don’t require a specialized plan, HWA may be for you.	Consumer Sentiment Index and Customer Survey

As a company with one of the longest tenures in the home warranty industry, American Home Shield offers three plans on a monthly and annual contract basis. The company’s ShieldSiver plan starts as low as $29.99 per month and covers major systems, while ShieldGold, which starts at $49.99 monthly, covers the above and major appliances. For $79.99 monthly, customers who opt for the ShieldPlatinum plan can get the coverage of Silver and Gold and see their appliance cap rise to $4,000 per item, and much more.Learn more: American Home Shield review	Why We Picked ItAmerican Home Shield offers three value-packed plans, starting with the ShieldSilver plan, which is lower than many competitors’ base plans. Once customers reach ShieldPlatinum status, the raised appliance cap, an additional $1,000 in roof leak coverage, $250 to address code compliance problems, free HVAC tune-ups and unlimited AC refrigerant coverage could make a $79.99 monthly fee and up to $125 service fee worth it long-term.Why We Like ItThe lowest plan American Home Shield offers is a more affordable option than many competitors. We appreciate that some of the elements its base plan offers, like coverage for pre-existing conditions and code violations, are not often included in competitors’ plans, which helps American Home Shield stand out. We also liked that American Home Shield had plan coverage for those who live in condos, manufactured or mobile homes or who own rental properties.What We Don’t LikeAmerican Home Shield isn’t available everywhere—it doesn’t currently cover Alaska or Washington, D.C. Also, while it’s technically allowed for customers to choose their own technicians, those technicians must go through a company approval process, which can be an irksome detail for some.Who It’s Best ForThose who have condos, rental properties or manufactured/mobile homes and want total coverage may find it from American Home Shield.

With three tiered plans to choose from and all 50 states covered, ARW Home offers a variety of options with different price points for all homeowners to consider. ARW Home’s Kitchen Plus plan starts around $40 monthly and includes coverage specifically for appliances like refrigerators, microwaves, dishwashers and kitchen exhaust fans, as well as water heaters and interior electrical systems.The next-higher-tiered Platinum Plan covers Kitchen Plus and more systems like central ACs and heating and washers and dryers for around $65 per month, while the Platinum Premier Plan adds even more coverage for items like plumbing for around $75 monthly.Learn more: ARW Home review	Why We Picked ItWhile many competitors offer two strong plans, ARW Home offers three, including one focused on kitchen appliances. This offering gives homeowners more pricing flexibility and doesn’t lock you into a more comprehensive plan than you need. We also appreciate that the pool, sewer line and water line are optional add-ons.Why We Like ItOn top of ideal pricing structure and plan options, homeowners can look forward to choosing their own technician. Plus, those who live in older homes won’t be susceptible to age-of-system denial—as long as your system or appliance is in good shape, it can likely be serviced.What We Don’t LikeARW Home’s cancellation policy is more rigid and costs more ($45) than many competitors. If you don’t have the budget flexibility to risk paying a cancellation fee or you’re looking for a more straightforward cancellation process, this may not be the company for you.Who It’s Best ForARW Home is best for those needing a specific kitchen appliances plan or those who want to choose their own technician for repairs.

Serving all 50 states, The Home Service Club offers two main plan options—Standard and Comprehensive—which range from around $51 per month for Standard to $62 for Comprehensive. Both plans offer standard, broad coverage for household appliances and systems, while the Comprehensive Plan offers extended coverage as well as new coverage for pest control, sump pumps and more.

You can also choose your own technician if you go with The Home Service Club, which may appeal to those who have great existing relationships with their contractors.What We Don’t LikeWith service fees up to $125, The Home Service Club isn’t the least expensive option. Also, those who want any less coverage than the standard plan may not find The Home Service Club to be a good choice for them.Who It’s Best ForHomeowners who have fairly new appliances or live in newer properties or condos may find The Home Service Club to be a good fit. Though the service fees are higher than those of many other competitors, living in a newer residence could help reduce the number of issues.	Consumer Sentiment Index and Customer Survey

Cinch Home Services (once known as Cross Country Services) has been in the home warranty business for over 45 years. Cinch created three separate plans—one for appliances, one for systems and one combining both plans—for around $35, $35 and $45 per month, respectively. The Appliances Plan covers all basic home appliances like refrigerators, microwaves and dishwashers, while the Built-in Systems Plan focuses its coverage on HVAC, ductwork, plumbing and electrical systems but covers more. The Complete Home Plan covers all of the above.Learn more: Cinch Home Services review	Why We Picked ItWe love a three-plan tiered approach, which Cinch does well. Homeowners who only need appliances or systems covered have those options, while those who want comprehensive coverage can get it for a relatively low price—$45 per month on average. We also appreciate that Cinch has 24/7 customer support phone service, which should help give homeowners peace of mind, should something happen on a Sunday evening.Why We Like ItCinch offers interesting perks like a 180-day workmanship guarantee and a $500 reimbursement toward homeowners’ insurance deductibles, which sweeten the deal of an already cost-effective plan structure.What We Don’t LikeCinch’s $150 service fee per visit is one of the highest among major competitors, making it a pricier option for budget-conscious homeowners.Who It’s Best ForHomeowners who prefer to have more than two options, those who are looking to cover just appliances or just systems or those who are looking for a good plan on a budget may find that Cinch is a great option for them.

Of all the companies on this list, AFC Home Warranty is the only company to offer four comprehensive home warranty plans. Starting at $41 monthly, AFC’s Silver Plan covers nine systems, including the refrigerator, oven, range and laundry machines, while the Gold Plan (starting at around $55 monthly) combines 15 appliances and systems, like plumbing and electrical systems.AFC Home Warranty’s Platinum Plan (which starts at around $64 monthly) expands coverage to built-in microwaves, plumbing stoppages and more, while the Diamond Plan (costing around $152 monthly) goes as far as covering electronics (like smartphones) and exterior sewer and water lines.Learn more: AFC Home Warranty review	Why We Picked ItThough AFC Home Warranty doesn’t serve all 50 states, it makes up for its lack of coverage in Washington, Hawaii and California by offering the most in the other 47. The company offers four comprehensive plans starting around $41 monthly that address every level of coverage in most homes.Why We Like ItWe appreciate the total coverage of the four home warranty plans offered to homeowners, plus the option to use your own technician versus one the company assigns. We also like that customers can opt for a month-to-month contract instead of an annual plan.What We Don’t LikeIf you are looking for a cost-effective option, AFC Home Warranty may not be for you. Not only are the service fees up to $125 per visit, but cancellation fees are as pricey as they come—$75. If you live in an older home, it’s also important to know that the company doesn’t cover any known or unknown pre-existing conditions.Who It’s Best ForHomeowners who want the ultimate coverage (as well as additional protection plans) will have a lot to choose from with AFC Home Warranty.

How Much Do Home Warranties Cost?
You should expect home warranty costs to be about $325 to $1,200 per year on average or about $57 monthly. Average monthly costs for the lowest-tiered plan with the least amount of coverage hovers around $27 while the highest cost reflects the average plan with the most comprehensive coverage. Service fees can range between $50 and $150. Premiums are the cost you’ll pay each month whether you use your home warranty or not, while service fees are what you’ll pay each time a pro visits your home for a service call. You may be able to pay a lower service call fee if you pay a higher premium or vice versa, so keep that in mind when shopping around.
These numbers were fairly consistent with the responses from our home warranty survey, with a majority of respondents (81%) citing their home warranty costs at around $801 to $900 per month.
While it can be tempting to choose the absolute cheapest home warranty company or plan, we recommend considering other factors beside cost, including coverage, reviews and service guarantees.

How to Choose the Best Home Warranty Company
A home warranty should be tailored to your home. Before you lock down a company, it’s crucial to do the following:
Solidify Your Budget
On average, home warranty plans cost between $300 and $600 annually, and you should expect service fees ranging from $50 to $150, depending on the company and your chosen plan. It’s important to feel confident in your financial commitment on a monthly and yearly basis.
Assess Coverage Needs
What do you need coverage for in your home? Some people may only need coverage for appliances, like washers and dryers, or systems like HVAC and electrical, while others may want both. Get a clear picture of the items covered in each home warranty plan you review.
Read Reviews
Search each home warranty company on sites like the Better Business Bureau, Yelp and Google to get a sense for how current and past customers feel about the business. Search specifically for local reviews and those that mention the specific issues you want to cover.

Obtain Multiple Quotes
Once you narrow down your choices to a few home warranty companies, you’ll want to reach out for quotes from a few different companies. This will help you compare costs as well as what is included in each plan.
Review Contracts and Terms
Obtain a sample contract for each provider and read the fine print to ensure you understand everything. Each home warranty provider outlines its coverage restrictions in the fine print. For example, a home warranty company may offer up to $3,000 for HVAC repairs throughout your contract period.
There may also be other restrictions or policies to note in these sample contracts too, such as coverage for pre-existing conditions, whether you choose your own technician, typical response times, any workmanship guarantees and if you’re subject to any cancellation fees.
Understand the Claims Process
A home warranty company becomes important when an issue arises. Inevitably, you’ll have to make a claim, so it’s pivotal to research a company’s claim process before signing on. Some companies offer mobile apps that simplify making a claim, while others allow online submissions. Separately, you should ask each company you speak with about their average response times from putting in the claim to solving the issue.
What Do Home Warranties Cover?
Coverage varies provider by provider, but most home warranty companies cover major household appliances like dishwashers, refrigerators, ovens, washers and dryers, as well as major systems like HVAC, plumbing and electrical. Many companies offer combination plans that are more comprehensive in nature, blanketing coverage over your whole home. Some companies dig deeper and offer more specialized coverage for things like pools, septic systems and sump pumps.

What Do Home Warranties Not Cover?
Many home warranty companies won’t cover structural issues (like windows, floors or doors), cosmetic damage to appliances or systems, natural disaster and weather-related damage and most areas outside the main house, like outdoor plumbing or sewer lines. Coverage for appliances or systems with pre-existing conditions is often limited. There are also restrictions based on how large your house is, and don’t forget about coverage caps.
Are Home Warranties Worth The Cost?
Home warranties can be worth it for many homeowners, but it’s a unique decision. For instance, a home warranty might be a better investment for someone with an older home where repairs needs might often arise than for those living in a new home with appliances still covered under manufacturers’ warranties.
We recommend considering the cost of your home warranty and service fees and comparing it to your expected average home repair costs. “Always ask for clarification on exclusions to ensure you understand what is and what isn’t covered,” says Marcus Hill, a member of Forbes Home Advisory Board with two decades of experience as a home appraiser and real estate investor. “Watch out for excessive service call fees or unclear fee structures. Some companies charge high fees every time you request service, even if the repair is denied. Ensure the fee structure is reasonable and transparent.”
You should also weigh how much you value peace of mind and check to see if your home qualifies for specific plans due to age and location. Finally, get several quotes from different companies to get the full picture of cost.
Our Home Warranty Survey Findings
Earlier in 2025 we asked 1,800 homeowners how they felt about their home warranty policies, what they paid and how much they used them. Here are some of the most eye-opening findings:
Peace of mind was the most common reason people cited for getting a home warranty policy at 64%, followed by covering their aging systems (44%) and appliances and rounded out by convenience (40%).
It’s probably no surprise that plan options and pricing were the most popular reasons people picked a home warranty plan, coming in at 47% and 44%. Other top reasons included brand reputation and recognition (35%) and recommendations from friends and family (32%).
As for what’s most commonly covered, a whopping 70% of people said their heating systems are a part of their home warranty plans, while 67% of respondents said their electrical systems were part of their plan. Other common coverage items were cooling systems 66% and plumbing at 62%.
Many (87%) said they found it easy to understand the terms and conditions of a home warranty plan. A similar number (86%) were happy with the customer service of these companies if there were any issues.
In perhaps the most reassuring number, 81% of respondents said they plan to renew when their home warranty plan expires.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
What is a home warranty?
Home warranties are an optional policy homeowners can purchase to protect their systems and appliances. For example, when your dishwasher breaks and leaves you with a costly bill, a home warranty can step in and help to cover those costs. Home warranties typically cover repairs or replacements of appliances and last for a set period of time. This type of warranty is not included with the purchase of a home and comes at an added cost to the homeowner, paid either via contract or annual or monthly fees.
What factors should I consider when shopping for a home warranty?
The best home warranty company will provide a timely claims process and have a fee structure that meets your budget. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) suggests asking yourself the following questions before making a commitment:
Does the warranty have the potential to save you money?
What are the warranty’s limitations?
Is the claims process grueling or slow?
Are you working with a reputable company?
What are some of the pitfalls of home warranties?
Some of the complaints we’ve seen about home warranties include caps on claims, the inability to choose your own contractor and delays in connecting with a company to get a contractor to come out to your home. However, some complaints can stem from points in the contract that may not have been explained or addressed in detail. To avoid purchasing a home warranty that won’t provide what you need, ensure you review the contract thoroughly before committing.
Do home warranties differ from homeowners insurance?
Homeowners insurance typically covers disasters and other covered incidents that can affect your home’s structure. These are typically mandatory in order to obtain a mortgage loan. Home warranties are optional and cover routine home repairs and replacements on covered systems and appliances.
How do home warranties work?
With a home warranty, you’ll select a plan and pay a premium, usually monthly. Once you have a repair that should be covered under your plan, you’ll typically request service through the company and pay a service fee for a technician to come to your home. From there, if the repair is covered under your plan, they’ll perform the service or follow-up with any additional info.
