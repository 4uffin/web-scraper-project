According to Forbes Home’s extensive market research, the average internet bill is $65 per month. But budget-minded shoppers have the potential to save more—and to share the best options among the cheapest internet providers, we carefully weighed plans, contract requirements, bundling options and more.
The Forbes Home team reviewed 25 leading national internet providers across nearly 70 metrics. We also put service to the test and surveyed more than 2,000 customers to hear about their experiences. We put more weight on low-cost plans for this list while still considering the overall value that these companies provide. We still highly recommend doing your own research, as internet costs, speeds and availability will vary based on your location and other factors. You may also be able to save even more money through bundling and promotions, so use our list as a jumping-off point.
Why you can trust Forbes Home
The Forbes Home team is committed to bringing you independent, unbiased ratings and information. We use data and expert advice to inform all of our content. For this article, we evaluated 25 national internet providers offering a variety of connection types, including fiber, DSL, cable, fixed wireless, satellite and 5G home internet services. We then scored them against 69 different attributes, including pricing, availability, customer reviews and more. Plus, our advisory board of licensed professionals fact-checks and reviews our content for accuracy and relevancy. You can read more about our editorial guidelines and the internet providers’ methodology for the ratings below.

You can use your own equipment, saving you on rental fees, and take advantage of the company’s bundling options to save even more.Learn more: AT&T Internet review	Why We Picked ItAT&T boasts some of the biggest attributes we look for in a lower-cost internet plan. Most of its plans come with no data caps and no annual contracts. We also like that you can save money thanks to its plentiful promotions and bundling options with mobile and streaming services.Why We Like ItAT&T offers free self-installation options, and we often saw the company waive its $99 professional installation fee in our research. Though its prices aren’t the lowest of the companies we considered, we think the value you get for its plans, which include fiber options, makes it a well-rounded choice.What We Don’t LikeSome of its plans have data caps, and you may have to pay the professional installation fee in some cases. You may also be subject to costs like activation fees, so be sure to check out the fine print.Who It’s Best ForAT&T can be a great choice to consider for many budget-conscious internet customers.

In addition to bundling with mobile, you can also find discounts on some of your favorite streaming services like Hulu.What We Don’t LikeIf speed is a big concern, you might find T-Mobile’s plans too slow. Additionally, 5G home internet may not be the most stable option.Who It’s Best ForT-Mobile Home Internet can be a great option to consider, especially if you’re already a T-Mobile customer.

Comcast Xfinity offers many different ways to save, making it an obvious contender for our list. The cable giant offers a wide variety of bundling deals for TV and streaming services, allowing you to save some serious dough. Additionally, Xfinity, which is available in 35 states, has some of the lowest-cost plans on our list, even before bundling.Learn more: Xfinity Internet review	Why We Picked ItXfinity offers discounts on bundling your home internet with a mobile line and cable, and you can also save 40% on Apple TV+, Netflix, and Peacock thanks to its StreamSaver deal. Additionally, it boasts many plan options with its lowest-cost plan starting at $19.99.Why We Like ItWe enjoy that you can choose from many different strategies to save money with Xfinity, including opting for a contract plan to save money and choosing to lock in pricing for a certain amount of time. With its wide range of plans and speeds as well as plentiful promotions, you can choose your own adventure to get the perfect combo of savings and speed.What We Don’t LikeXfinity’s low plan prices can be enticing, but it’s important to note that they can greatly increase after the promotional period. Renting equipment or opting for professional installation will cost you. Its plans also come with data caps, though it’s a high limit of 1.2 TB per month.Who It’s Best ForXfinity is a great option to consider, especially for those who want to bundle with cable. However, we recommend doing your research to ensure you’ll still be getting a competitive price after the promotional period.	Pros & ConsBundling discountsLow promotional plan pricingFlexible plan optionsPricing can go up sharplyLocation-dependent pricingEquipment and pro installation cost a fee	Customer SurveyIn our survey of 2,200 consumers who have purchased home internet in the last two years, we found fairly mixed sentiments about Xfinity. Of Xfinity customers surveyed, 55% said they felt like its pricing was transparent. However, it got one of the highest scores for responding to problems quickly, with 81% saying the company addressed any outages or issues right away.	Plans and PricingBelow is a sampling of Xfinity internet pricing from our research. Note that availability and pricing will vary based on your location and prices will change depending on your contract option and any promotions. You should always get your own quote.

Cox Internet offers a wide array of plans that can reach up to high speeds, all while staying fairly competitive when it comes to pricing. Though it’s only available in 19 states, the brand has a large service area in these states. It even offers free panoramic Wi-Fi equipment for at least a time with all of its plans.Learn more: Cox Internet review	Why We Picked ItOne of the biggest struggles in comparison shopping for internet services is transparency, and we really appreciate that it lists prices and speeds for all to see on its website. Like many plans on our list, it offers bundling options with a Cox Mobile plan, allowing you to save even more. We also appreciate that customers can provide their own equipment and that there are self-installation options available.Why We Like ItCox offers many plan options, allowing its services to suit a variety of budgets and speed requirements. You’ll also benefit from a lack of cancellation fees or annual contracts. If you travel a lot, you may also find value in its 4 million hot spots, which you can access with your Cox plan.What We Don’t LikePrices can go up sharply after Cox’s promotional period. It also technically has data caps on its plans below the premium offering, though it’s quite a high one at 1.25 TB.Who It’s Best ForCox can be a great choice for those in its service area who want to use their own equipment and want fairly high speeds for the price. We recommend looking into both the promotional costs and what you might pay after that period.	Pros & ConsMany plans availableNo contracts or cancellation feesAffordable internet plans available to those who qualifyPrices can increase after promotional periodData caps on most plans	Customer Survey In our survey of 2,200 consumers who purchased home internet in the last two years, Cox Internet got fairly mixed scores. Of those surveyed, 68% of Cox customers said they’d recommend the provider to a friend or family member, which is somewhere in the middle of company scores. When asked about reliability, Cox customers also scored it in the middle of our rankings, with 60% of customers calling it reliable.	Plans and PricingBelow is a sampling of the plans Cox offers, though availability can vary by your location. It’s also worth noting that Cox has other plan options for homes that qualify, and they’ll cost you even less. We recommend looking into these, especially if you’re a part of a government assistance program such as SNAP, Medicaid or Veterans Pension, as you may qualify.

Pairing your home internet service with another service (or more than one!) is a common and smart strategy to save money, which is part of why Verizon Fios made our list. Verizon is a favorite of many for its mobile and internet plans, making it a great provider for bundling deals. Though it’s only available in limited areas for now, Fios home internet offers several plan options with fiber connectivity and few strings attached.Read more: Verizon Fios Internet review	Why We Picked ItThe most obvious money-saving strategy with Fios is through its bundling deals, as you can save around $15 per month by bundling your home internet and mobile phone services. You can also bundle deals with streamers like Max and Disney+. We also appreciate that Verizon Fios offers guaranteed pricing for up to five years and a free router with all plans.Why We Like ItWhile the best deals are to be had when you bundle, Verizon Fios also has a variety of other perks like no annual contracts, no data caps for residential internet users and free equipment options. The company offers self-installation options and all of its plans offer fiber connectivity for stable and fast internet.What We Don’t LikeAs with all providers, Fios’s prices get less appealing without bundling. You may also have to have a $99 installation fee.

Honorable Mentions
Spectrum: Spectrum is another great choice to consider for cheap internet plans. The company offers plans with speeds ranging from 100 Mbps to 1 Gbps, and plans start at $30 per month. However, it’s worth noting that costs are only locked in for one year and can go up after that period, so be sure to read the fine print.
Optimum: Optimum’s plans range in speed from 300 Mbps to 8 Gbps and plans start at $40 per month. The company also frequently runs promotions, allowing you to save even more. However, note that Optimum requires contracts, and its rates are subject to change at any time, but you will be notified in advance.
Frontier: With its fiber internet service ranging from 500 Mbps to 7 Gbps, Frontier can be a great choice for those who value speed and their wallets. Plans start at $29.99 per month for 12 months when you opt into autopay, but note that costs can go up by a lot after that time, so be sure to read all plan terms.

How To Pick the Best Cheap Internet Plan for You
It can be tempting to choose the cheapest internet plan off the bat, but you should consider a few factors to find a balance of quality internet and a fair price.
Budget
Determine a budget you’re comfortable with when it comes to your internet bill and try to find a plan that gets as close as possible while still allowing you to get the speed and other benefits you need. If you’re unsure what a reasonable price is, comparison shopping can come in handy.
Speed
Extremely low-cost internet plans can be great for your wallet, but not so great when it comes time to do a video call or stream a movie. We recommend researching what speeds you’ll need and factoring that into your internet plan for shopping. The FCC has some helpful broadband speed guides to aid you in figuring out the minimum speeds you should be aiming for, and many internet providers will tell you how many devices and what kinds of activities you can perform on each plan.
Company Info
The particular plan you choose is important, but so is the provider you choose. Check out reviews for every company you vet and look into things like customer support options and cancellation fees to get a fuller picture of what your experience might be.
Reliability
Another important company factor is the provider’s reliability. Check reviews for words like latency and downtime, and look into internet plan scorecards for typical speeds. Once you get a plan, you can perform an internet speed test to ensure you’re getting close to the speeds you expected. Any red flags here can make even the cheapest internet not worth it.
Bundling and Other Discounts
On its face, one internet plan may seem out of your budget, but be sure to look into all the discounts you can, including bundling with your cell phone, TV plan or streaming services. These perks can make some plans more in your price range and those within your budget an even better value.
Things To Look Out For in Cheap Internet Plans
When price is the biggest factor you’re considering, it can be easy to miss some red flags and fine print when comparison shopping. Be sure to keep these factors in mind when comparing some cheap internet plan options.
Intro pricing: Many internet companies will advertise a lower rate that’s locked in for a particular amount of time. After that, your price can skyrocket in the following months and years. We recommend looking into pricing carefully and considering if your cost will rise and when.
Data caps: Many internet plans, especially those that are lower cost, can come with red tape like data caps, where you’ll need to pay more for extra data or may even deal with reduced speeds after a certain point. Keep an eye out for data caps and other similar limits when reviewing internet plans so you know what to expect.
Extremely low speeds: If you’re not super in-tune with internet terminology, it can be easy to look into super slow plans just because of their enticingly low monthly costs. Get a sense for the speeds you’ll need before committing to any plan.

How Much Does an Internet Plan Typically Cost?
According to our research, internet plans cost anywhere from $20 to $300 per month, with an average cost of $65 per month. Many factors can affect your bill, including plan speed, company, connection type and more.
Factors That Affect Internet Costs
Speed: Generally, the faster your plan, the more you’ll pay. The key here is finding the right blend of affordability and comfortable internet bandwidth.
Company: Every company will offer a different set of plan options, so your choice of company will affect your final bill. Some companies will tend to focus more on affordability, such as the companies we listed above.
Equipment costs and other fees: Some internet providers will charge fees for renting equipment, professional installation, going over your data cap or other services. Review all of the fine print and your bills each month to ensure you know what you’re paying for.
Location: Where you live can affect your internet bill in many ways—for one, companies may charge more in higher-cost-of-living areas. Location can also affect plan availability and connection type, both of which can raise or lower your bill.
Connection type: Your plan’s connection type can also affect your monthly internet bill. Fiber connection, which is known to be fast and stable, will cost more than cable connections, for instance. If your only option is satellite internet, this can also raise your cost.
Ways To Save Money on Internet Costs
Internet service is a necessary expense for most people, but there are a few strategies you can employ to keep your bill as low as possible.
Determine What Speed You Need (and What You Don’t)
If your internet is working great, you may not second-guess if you’ve chosen the right speed. However, do some research to determine if you’re using the recommended plan for your household. Taking into account the number of devices, the number of people in the home and what you use the internet for can help you determine the right plan for you. For example, the FCC recommends a minimum download speed of 12 to 25 Mbps for a household of two people using the internet at once for “moderate use.”
Once you make this determination, consider if downgrading to a slower plan or looking into alternatives from other providers may help you save money. It can feel risky to reduce plan speeds, but paying for more internet than you need can add up quickly.
Buy Equipment Outright
Many companies charge monthly rental fees for equipment, so buying your own modems and routers can help lower your costs. Be sure that the company allows it and that what you purchase works with that provider.
Look Into Bundling
Many companies offer discounts for bundling with your mobile phone, streaming services and TV provider, so be sure to look into these offers to lower your bill.
Reach Out to the Provider
Internet providers want your business, so if there is a way to get you as a customer or keep you as one, they will want to try and make it happen. If you’re interested in a company, but want to see how you can get the best deal possible, it doesn’t hurt to reach out to the company to get the most updated pricing information and see if there is any way to make things more affordable. This strategy may not always work, but at the very least, you’ll know you’re getting the best deal you can.
Shop Around
Even if you’ve already landed on an internet provider, you may be able to switch providers to get a new, lower introductory price. Naturally, this price will likely go up, but it can be a good way to save some money, especially if the price it increases to is lower than what you’re currently paying. We recommend keeping your eye out for lower rates often to ensure you’re getting the best deal in your market—just be sure to keep an eye out for any fine print that can make a deal less of a steal than you think.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
What is the cheapest way to get Wi-Fi in your home?
If you’re looking for a truly budget solution to the internet, it’s typically cheaper to use the mobile hotspot through your mobile phone plan. However, this can add up quickly as well, as many plans that offer hotspots are more expensive and you may reach a data limit quickly. Otherwise, 5G internet and some slower internet cable plans can cost less. We recommend looking into many companies and connection types in your area to determine the best deal for you.
What is a good monthly internet bill?
What is considered a reasonable price for internet service will depend on your chosen company, plan speed, connection type and more. That said, internet connections cost around $65 per month on average. It’s wise to do some market research for similar plans to ensure you’re getting a good deal based on your particular situation.
