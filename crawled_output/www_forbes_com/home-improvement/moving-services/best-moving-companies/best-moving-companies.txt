*NOTE: We planned a long-distance move. Our researchers requested an estimate for a “two-bedroom” full-service packing and moving from Brooklyn, NY to Charlotte, NC – a total distance of 630 miles. It’s worth noting that Atlas Van Lines offered a general estimate because the company requires a pre-move assessment before it can provide a more accurate estimate.

We picked JK moving as the best full service moving company. It’s another relatively young company compared to others on this list, having started in 1982. Since then, it has built a good reputation among customers and ranks among the highest rated movers in our survey. 87% said booking was easy and 89% would recommend the company to family and friends, highlighting its high customer satisfaction. JK Moving also offers packing, unpacking and vehicle shipping services.Learn More: JK Moving Review	Why We Picked ItJK Moving stands out for its dedication to sustainability, eco-friendly practices and various customer service options.Why We Like ItAgain, we like that JK Moving has prioritized sustainability, offering customers eco-friendly moving options, among other things. We were also impressed by its variety of customer support options, which included live chat, phone service and an app.Why We Don’t Like ItPricing weighed heavily on our evaluations, which is why JK Moving lost some points. While not always the most expensive mover, it tends to be more expensive than others on this list. However, it does offer financing through a third-party provider.Who It’s Best ForThose looking for a well-regarded, full-service moving company should consider JK Moving, especially if receiving the lowest price isn’t their highest priority. Customers looking for eco-friendly options should also consider this company.	Consumer Sentiment Index

North American Van Lines is owned and operated by Allied Van Lines, our pick for accurate pricing. Given this and the company’s customizable options, it’s no surprise that the well-established North American also ranked on our list.	Why We Picked ItThe company has an overall solid reputation, with customer sentiment skewing positively on multiple categories. It is also accredited and has an A+ rating with the BBB. Our phone researchers reported friendly and helpful representatives who were prompt with answers and information.Why We Like ItAlong with its reputation, we like that North American Van Lines offers several services and customizations, including full-service packing, furniture assembly and disassembly, antique shipping, piano shipping and more. Like its sister company, Allied Van Lines, North American is also dedicated to accurate pricing.Why We Don’t Like ItSince flexibility is important to many consumers, we don’t like North American’s relatively strict three-day cancellation window, which cost it some points in our ranking. Quotes were also difficult to obtain due to an in-home evaluation requirement.Who It’s Best ForThose who value pricing accuracy and customizable options should consider North American Van Lines. However, if budget is your primary concern and you are planning a long-distance move, you may want to look elsewhere.	Consumer Sentiment Index

If you want a good value on local moves, consider Atlas Van Lines. While this nearly 80-year-old company offers long-distance and international moves, local moves stood out in our review, with options for storage, specialty item moving and more.Learn more: Atlas Van Lines review	Why We Picked ItAccording to our consumer sentiment index data, Atlas Van Lines received some of the highest customer reviews on this list. We also like that the company offers price matching, AAA discounts and other perks.Why We Like ItYou’ll find that Atlas Van Lines is an everyday favorite on customer review sites, which is always a good sign. We also like that it has nationwide availability with over 1,500 moving partners. Its value-based local moving also helps it stand out from the competition. We appreciate that Atlas provides thoughtful extras like car rentals as well as airline and hotel discounts.Why We Don’t Like ItAtlas Van Lines does not have the most flexible cancellation policy on this list. It only allows penalty-free cancellation within three days of signing the work order. Additionally, Atlas relies on its partnerships with third-party moving companies. While this isn’t necessarily bad, it’s best to make sure you’re comfortable with this and the third party Atlas chooses for your move.Who It’s Best ForAtlas Van Lines can be a good fit for a wide demographic; however, it’s especially beneficial to customers looking to move locally. Since the cancellation policy is more rigid than others on this list, it’s important to be confident of your moving date before signing any contracts.	Consumer Sentiment Index

If you are planning a long-distance move, United Van Lines should be on your list of best national moving companies to consider. It’s one of our top picks for providing excellent value for long-distance moves in all 50 states and offering helpful features like GPS tracking. This nearly 100-year-old company is popular among consumers for its one-stop-shop approach to moving.Learn more: United Van Lines review	Why We Picked ItWhile pricing information for this business is more difficult to obtain than other companies on our list, we still consider United Van Lines the best. Our phone researchers contacted the company and found the representatives reasonably friendly and willing to offer a ballpark figure, proving that general quotes are relatively easy to get without providing too many details upfront.Why We Like ItWe found many aspects of United Van Lines’ services beneficial. However, one of the most standout features was its commitment to delivering accurate quotes. This helps you avoid unwanted cost surprises down the road. We also like that the company offers free cancellations until your move begins.Why We Don’t Like ItThe trade-off for accurate pricing is that those prices take time to be provided. Getting a quote can take multiple days and requires a virtual or in-home review. While we commend the company for its accuracy, this process can make price shopping and comparison difficult. Besides that, some customer reviews mention communication errors and skipped appointments.Who It’s Best ForUnited Van Lines is an excellent option for long-distance customers looking for great value,  accurate pricing and extra services like GPS tracking. It’s ideal, especially if you don’t mind waiting a few days for those prices. People uncertain about their moving date could also benefit from United Van Lines due to its generous cancellation policy and $0 deposit.	Consumer Sentiment Index

Many reviews praise United Van Lines as a reputable moving company with a strong presence in the industry that provides various services. However, more negative reviews cite dissatisfaction with customer service, overall cost and transparency throughout the moving process. Others note issues with pricing discrepancies, damaged or missing items and delays. The mixed reviews suggest that while some customers are satisfied, others have had poor experiences with the company’s service and accountability.

Founded in 2003, Colonial Van Lines is a relative newcomer in the industry but stands out for its decent customer reviews, fair pricing and varied services, including long- and short-term storage solutions.	Why We Picked ItColonial Van Lines ranked on our list for several reasons, including its service catalog, pricing, customer sentiment ratings and more.Why We Like ItSpecializing in long-distance moves, Colonial prioritizes an often overlooked service—storage—which we love. It offers long-term and short-term solutions ranging from two weeks to two months or longer. Another notable offering is the company’s Colonial Cubes, which are delivered to your house for packing and then shipped away.Why We Don’t Like ItEven though Colonial Van Lines has agents across the country, it is not the best option for local moving services. The cancellation policy isn’t the most flexible, with fees applicable after 72 hours of signing the contract. The company also requires a deposit to book a move.Who It’s Best ForCustomers planning a long-distance move and anticipating storage needs should consider Colonial Van Lines for its varied options and fair pricing. However, those moving locally or internationally should look elsewhere.	Consumer Sentiment Index

Overall, Colonial Van Lines receives mixed customer reviews, with some praising the company’s professional and careful service, while others refer to poor communication, unexpected costs and damaged or missing items. Several customers report feeling scammed due to price increases and delayed deliveries, although a few note positive interactions with specific representatives who addressed issues. The company’s reliance on subcontractors appears to contribute to inconsistent service quality.

For those who value pricing transparency, 95-year-old Allied Van Lines is a good choice. It is our top pick for quote accuracy. Whether you are moving across town or the world, you can depend on Allied to give you an accurate quote.	Why We Picked ItWhile obtaining a quote can take longer than with other companies on this list, customers can count on the fact that the quote they receive is accurate, assuming no major changes are made to the move.Why We Like ItBesides pricing accuracy, we like that Allied Van Lines has nationwide availability and doesn’t require a deposit to book. According to the data from our consumer sentiment index, Allied ranked relatively well, with its strongest category amongst consumers being (not surprisingly) pricing and transparency.Why We Don’t Like ItWhile pricing is accurate, it also takes time. Some customers might be turned off by this fact, as it makes price shopping more cumbersome. While the prices were reasonable, they weren’t the lowest on this list.Who It’s Best ForAllied Van Lines is best for customers looking for a mover with a long-standing, positive reputation that prioritizes price transparency and accuracy. However, precise quotes do come at the cost of time, so it’s best for customers who are not in a hurry.	Consumer Sentiment Index

International Van Lines scored well based on our rigorous methodology partly due to the company’s extensive list of services and widespread availability across the U.S. and the world. With over two decades in the business, IVL remains a rapidly growing, highly-awarded moving company worth considering.NOTE: While International Van Lines offers services almost anywhere, it only directly handles moves in a limited number of locations. It acts as a broker in the other areas, depending entirely on contracting third parties. Our review focuses on the company’s performance as a carrier. Brokering is a common practice within the industry, so it’s essential to research the broker and the carrier they choose to work with. Learn more: International Van Lines review	Why We Picked ItInternational Van Lines offers various services across all 50 states and more than 180 countries worldwide, including Canada and Mexico, proving it can handle just about any move.Why We Like ItIVL offers an extended list of tailored moving options at competitive prices. The company can accommodate customers who want a completely hands-off experience and those who want to be more involved. We also like that IVL offers four insurance options and widespread international availability.Why We Don’t Like ItSome customer sentiments and reviews reflect poor customer service and communication issues. IVL also lost points for requiring a 25% deposit to reserve a moving date.Who It’s Best ForEven though the company requires a deposit to secure a date, it offers free cancellation until 48 hours before the scheduled move. This makes the company a good option for those who value flexibility or anticipate date changes. The company is also an excellent choice for value-focused customers, offering a long list of services at competitive rates.	Consumer Sentiment Index

The company provides local and long-distance moves, along with discounts and other benefits.Why We Like ItWe like American Van Lines’ flexible cancellation policy. It allows free cancellations within a week of the move date and the option to put your move on hold for up to 12 months. We also appreciate its specialty shipping options, which ensure that even the bulkiest or most expensive items can be shipped safely.Why We Don’t Like ItUnfortunately, American Van Lines requires a deposit to book a move. It also lacks some of the customer service features of other companies, like 24/7 phone service, live chat and GPS tracking.Who It’s Best ForThose with larger or more valuable items should consider American Van Lines, which offers a variety of specialty services. People who value flexibility will like the company’s generous cancellation policy and 12-month holds.	Consumer Sentiment Index

What Are the Best Moving Companies?
After extensive research and analysis, we selected Mayflower Transit, JK Moving and North American Van Lines as the top residential moving companies for reliability, service and customer satisfaction. Our rankings are based on a comprehensive methodology scoring system that considers pricing, licensing and services offered. We also analyzed dozens of real moving companies quotes and used our consumer sentiment index tool to examine over 39,000 customer reviews, and incorporated customer survey data to determine our results.
How Much Does a Moving Company Cost?
The cost to hire a mover depends on several factors, including the distance of the move and the amount of stuff you have. Our research involving dozens of quotes from reputable moving companies found that, on average, you can expect to pay between $40 and $80 per hour with the standard two movers. Local moves are less expensive, and can cost anywhere from $300 and $6,900 total. Long-distance moves are pricier and can cost between $1,050 and $12,700.
What are 3 tips for negotiating a better moving price?
1. Move mid-week if possible. Moving companies often offer lower rates when their schedules are lighter.
2. Bring competitors’ quotes and see if [the moving company] can offer a better price.
3. Sign up for the company’s email and socials. You’ll be first to know if they run money-saving promotions.
—Dawn Smith, Moving Expert and Forbes Home Advisory Board Member
Factors That Affect the Cost of Moving
Every moving cost is unique, which is why we suggest getting multiple quotes based on your individual situation. Some factors that can affect your moving cost include:
Distance: Typically, the longer your move distance, the higher in price your move will be. Movers often charge by the mile and cross-country or even international moves will come with extra fees.
Move size: Move size is probably an even bigger factor in the cost of your move. The weight, volume and number of items you’re moving will make a difference. So while a three-bedroom home will typically always be more expensive than moving a one-bedroom home, if your one-bedroom home has several large wardrobes and a baby grand piano, expect prices to be high as well.
Type of move: Full-service moves that involve packing and unpacking and assembly and disassembly will add to your cost. Labor-only moves where movers only load boxes onto a truck and unload them into your new home will be lower cost.
Services:Special services like fragile item moving, moving instruments or even car shipping can add to your costs. If you need any other services other than moving boxes and transporting them from point A to point B, expect it to cost you.
Seasonal pricing: Typically the busiest season for moving is from May to September, so moving during that time can drive up pricing for some companies.

Key Factors to Consider When Hiring Movers
Keep these things in mind when researching and selecting the best moving company for you.
Services Offered
It’s not worth looking too far into a company if it can’t move you to where you need to go or if it can’t move specific items that you need transported. We recommend searching for household moving companies that can handle your specific situation when you search. For example, if you don’t want to handle packing and unpacking yourself, look for professional packers and movers or high-end moving companies that offer more complete options. In this case, we recommend specifically searching for full-service moving companies right off the bat. Also, if you need major car shipping services or plan to move across the country and need top long distance moving services, many of the top ranked national moving companies offer these services.
Coverage in Your Area
Of course you’ll want to ensure a mover can come to your current home, but since not all movers can handle interstate moves, if that’s the move you’re making, be sure to seek out companies specifically that bill themselves as interstate movers. Bonus points if the company explicitly states that it operates both in your origin and destination location. If you’re making a very long-distance or even international move, alter your search to include those parameters for the best success.
Tracking Options
Many modern moving companies will offer GPS tracking, especially for long-distance moving. Be sure to ask if your mover offers this and how you’ll be able to track your items.
Established Reputation
Checking online reviews of moving companies, asking friends and family members about their past experiences and generally looking into the online footprint for a company can help you choose a quality moving company. Understanding these factors is also key to learning how to compare moving companies effectively. You can further research by looking up the company’s USDOT number, if it’s an interstate mover, to check out its safety record.
Address Change
With all the different things you have to coordinate and worry about during a move, it’s easy to forget to submit a change-of-address form to the USPS. However, this is an important step, since you don’t want any important mail to be delivered to the new residents. Luckily changing your address is easy with a simple online form. Additionally, don’t forget to change your address for any mail-in subscriptions or upcoming package deliveries.
It’s best to change your address with USPS at least two weeks before your departure date, so there’s plenty of time for staff to input the information and alert your mail carrier of the change. You can choose the exact date for the address switch. It’s an easy process online.
— Dawn Smith, Moving Expert and Forbes Home Advisory Board Member
Insurance and Licenses
According to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, movers are required by law to provide at least two different liability options, also known as valuation coverage. They are known as Full Value and Released Value Protection. Released Value Protection is free to consumers however, it is extremely limited. With this option, the mover is liable for no more than 60 cents per pound per item. For example, if a $500, 20-pound TV was damaged during transport, the company is only obligated to pay you $12.
If you’d like to pay a premium, you can opt for Full Value Protection. This option reimburses customers based on the value of their item, not just the weight. In this case the mover has to either replace or repair the TV or reimburse the full $500 value.
To avoid scams and protect your belongings, always look for licensed moving companies registered with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. Many of the most accredited moving companies go beyond basic licensing to demonstrate compliance with industry standards, giving customers additional peace of mind. All interstate moving companies are required to have a USDOT number which you can look up on the FMCSA website. Each state will also have its own requirements for licensing and registration, so be sure to look at your state’s official government website for more details.
Weather
Depending on where you are moving, reliable moving services can make all the difference in planning around the weather. While winter is often a cheaper time of year to move, snow and cold temperatures can be a hindrance and cause delays. Summer can be a convenient time to move, but extreme heat and severe weather can also be a problem. While you can’t control the weather, think about your unique location and try to choose a time of year, where weather issues are less of concern.

What to Look Out for When Choosing a Moving Company
Red Flags
These are some of the most common red flags to look out for when selecting a moving company. For a more comprehensive list, check out this article from the FMCSA.
Extremely low prices: As the old saying goes, “If it’s too good to be true, then it probably is.”
Poor reviews: Besides negative reviews, check the reviews of moving companies carefully. If most are outdated, it may be a sign that the company is no longer competitive in the industry.
Large deposits: While deposits are relatively common and often okay, be wary if your company requires you to pay cash or an extremely large deposit.
Missing documentation: According to federal regulations, your mover is required to give you copies of the Your Rights and Responsibilities When You Move booklet and FMCSA’s Ready to Move brochure.
No inspection: To get you an estimate, reputable movers will require an in-home or virtual inspection to see the layout of your home and how many items need to be moved. If a company skips this step, it may not be among the most trusted moving companies.
Green Flags
While there are plenty of red flags to look out for, here are a few green flags you want to see in your potential moving company.
Written estimate: While not always binding, all reputable movers will provide you with a signed written estimate.
Transparency: A good moving company will be transparent in its pricing, informing you of any additional fees. It’ll also be upfront about licensing and insurance information.
Professional communication: Any correspondence with the company should be timely, courteous and straightforward.
Experience: Look for top-rated moving companies with several years of experience in the industry. Many recognizable moving and relocation companies have been around for decades, if not longer. Any company you choose should have a background in and understand the nuances of your specific location.
Broker vs. Carrier
When deciding between moving companies that are not brokers and those that are, it’s important to understand the difference between a broker and a carrier when choosing a reputable moving company. A good moving company will be forthright about which category it falls under.
A carrier is a company that works directly on your move. It has the crew that is on the ground packing your boxes, loading them into the truck and hauling your things to your new destination. A broker, on the other hand, coordinates a network consisting of multiple carriers. If you want to work with one company for your whole move, opt for a carrier. However, if you’d like to work with a larger international company, which may provide more service options, you’ll likely need to go with a broker.
All of the companies on our list are carriers except International Van Lines, which is a broker, and United Van Lines which acts as a broker for local moves but a carrier for everything else.

Methodology - How We Selected the Best Moving Companies
We developed our list of the best moving companies by first identifying competitors that met basic criteria such as licensing, insurance and legal registration. We reviewed the 69 most widely available companies from that list and scored them all based on 89 different attributes. Each company’s rating is determined by evaluating a variety of metrics, such as an in-house Consumer Sentiment Analysis, pricing, moving services and options, nationwide availability and more.
You can find out more about how Forbes Home rates moving companies on our detailed methodology page.
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
What is a reasonable tip?
How much you tip movers should reflect the amount of help they provide and the number of hours they work. A good rule of thumb is to tip $20 to $30 per person for a local move and $50 per person for long-distance moves. It’s also acceptable to tip between 10% and 20% of the total cost of the move.
What items should you move yourself?
Each moving company usually has a list of items they can’t move. This list typically includes ​​hazardous chemicals, paints, combustibles and large batteries. However, it’s a good idea to check with your moving company if you’re unsure. Also, valuable items like jewelry or art should either be moved by yourself or by using a specialty moving company.
How do I know if a moving company is trustworthy?
When looking for trusted moving companies, it’s important to take steps to avoid common moving scams. Get referrals from friends and family, look at online reviews and check government organizations like the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) for licensing and registration information.
