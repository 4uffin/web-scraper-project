Moving long-distance is a task and a half, which is why it’s so essential to choose the right one. Thankfully, we’re here to help you with some of the preliminary research.
To help prospective movers find the best long-distance moving company for their needs, we’ve carefully researched 65 moving companies who offer long distance moves, compared them against dozens of attributes, gathered and analyzed quotes and studied the reputations and consumer feedback of every provider. We also ran a Consumer Sentiment Index analysis of nearly 40,000 customer reviews to help customers find long-distance moving companies who can reliably get the job done.
Why you can trust Forbes Home
The Forbes Home team is committed to bringing you independent, unbiased ratings and information. We use data and expert advice to inform all of our content. We’ve evaluated 65 competitors, narrowing it down to the top 10 based on 89 attributes and our own in-depth research, including services, availability, first-hand quotes, deposits, insurance, licensing and customer ratings and scored each company against strict criteria. Plus, our advisory board of licensed professionals fact-checks and reviews our content for accuracy and relevancy.

Mayflower Transit made the list of the best long-distance moving companies for a few reasons, the biggest being its effort to minimize uncertainty for its customers. The company does this by providing GPS tracking so that customers will always know the status of their stuff. Additionally, Mayflower has binding quotes and price matching, further giving clients peace of mind.Learn more:
Mayflower Transit review	Why We Picked ItMayflower Transit sets itself apart with its helpful customer experience tools, like the aforementioned GPS tracking. Additionally, the company offers live chat, phone services and an app to its customers. Why We Like ItBesides GPS tracking, customer service tools and binding quotes, we like that Mayflower also offers a variety of specialty moving services. The company can move just about anything, from pianos to pool tables. What We Don’t LikeMayflower’s prices tend to be on the higher side, which may deter budget-conscious clients. While the company has gotten lots of positive feedback in the past, some negative reviews were present during our search, mostly pertaining to a lengthy quote process and inconsistent service throughout certain locations.Who It’s Best ForMayflower Transit is a good option if you are looking for a company with transparent pricing and features, like GPS tracking, that prioritizes peace of mind.

Colonial Van Lines earned its spot as one of the best movers due in part to its fair prices, customer-focused features and dedication to an aspect of long-distance moving that often becomes vital-–storage.Learn more:
Colonial Van Lines review	Why We Picked ItWe picked Colonial Van Lines for its expertise in long-distance moves and its wide variety of long- and short-term storage solutions. One notable offering is its Colonial Cubes, which are storage containers that are delivered and picked up at your house.Why We Like ItColonial has a variety of convenient customer-focused features, like GPS tracking, a mobile app and live chat functions. Its prices are competitive, and the company offers a service guarantee, price matching and special discounts.What We Don’t LikeOne area that Colonial could improve is its deposit policy—currently, customers are required to put down a 25% deposit in order to book a moving date. Additionally, cancellations must be made within three days of signing the contract in order to avoid penalties.Who It’s Best ForColonial Van Lines is best for people moving long distances who also need flexible storage options. The mover is ideal for those who are certain of their move date and are willing and able to put money down. Those who require more date flexibility should look elsewhere.	Consumer Sentiment Index

United Van Lines is a great choice for many, in part because of its commitment to accurate pricing. A virtual or in-home tour is required before you can get a final quote. However, this thoroughness can be good or bad, depending on your timeline.Learn more:
United Van Lines review	Why We Picked ItWe picked United Van Lines for its dedication to accurate pricing, along with its customer-centric policies and services like $0 deposits, a delivery window guarantee and GPS tracking. Serving all 50 states, United Van Lines can make long-distance moves anywhere in the U.S. happen.Why We Like ItWhile UVL has several advantageous features, it’s most notable for its commitment to accuracy. Although it does take time to get these accurate quotes, many will find it worth it for the peace of mind and to avoid being surprised down the road. Our phone research team found the representatives to be friendly and helpful. Though not an exact quote, they were also willing to give a ballpark estimate, revealing that general estimates are fairly easy to get without supplying too many details upfront.What We Don’t LikeAgain, accurate pricing comes at the cost of time, and we don’t love that it can take multiple days and a home survey to get a quote. This can be troublesome for those who are price-shopping on a tight deadline.Who It’s Best ForUnited Van Lines is best suited for customers who value accurate pricing and transparency more than speed and convenience (at least during the initial phases). If you have the time to wait for a quote, then United Van Lines may be a good option.	Consumer Sentiment Index

Atlas Van Lines has been around for more than 75 years. In that time, it expanded to cover all 50 states and several moving services, making it a great long-distance moving option.Learn more:
Atlas Van Lines review	Why We Picked ItWe chose Atlas Van Lines for several reasons, including its ability to accommodate a variety of moves, no matter the distance or specialty services needed. This full-service mover gives its clients peace of mind with its several decades of experience and service and delivery guarantees.Why We Like ItIn addition to what we stated above, we also like that Atlas does not require a deposit but does offer extra perks like price matching and AAA discounts. We also like that it provides GPS tracking and access to an app for added convenience and security.What We Don’t LikeCompared to other companies on this list, Atlas Van Lines doesn’t have the best cancellation policy: Customers are required to cancel within three days of signing their contract in order to avoid penalties. This policy doesn’t allow for a lot of flexibility, which is important to many planning long-distance moves.Who It’s Best ForAtlas Van Lines is a great option for a wide assortment of moves thanks to its variety of specialty moving services and many years of experience in the industry. However, if you aren’t certain of your moving dates, you might want to consider a different mover with a more flexible cancellation policy.	Consumer Sentiment Index

Additionally, we appreciate its binding quotes, delivery window and service guarantees.What We Don’t LikeAs flexibility is vital to many customers, we don’t like North American’s rather strict three-day cancellation window.

International Van Lines often ranks well among both customers and experts. Its competitive rates and high-quality service help it stand out from the pack.Learn more:
International Van Lines reviewNOTE:
While International Van Lines offers services almost anywhere, it only directly handles moves in a limited number of locations. It acts as a broker in the other areas, depending entirely on contracting third parties. Our review focuses on the company’s performance as a carrier. Brokering is a common practice within the industry, so it’s important to research the broker and the carrier they choose to work with. 	Why We Picked ItWe picked International Van Lines for its high-value services and customer-centric approach in several areas, like its generous free cancellation policy, binding quotes and GPS tracking.Why We Like ItAlong with its cancellation policy, which allows customers to cancel up to 48 hours before their move date penalty-free, we appreciate the company’s four insurance options and widespread domestic and international availability. What We Don’t LikeOne of our biggest grievances with IVL is its 25% deposit requirement, as many other companies on this list don’t even require a deposit to book a move. Customer experience could also be improved as the company skews negatively in nearly every category in our Consumer Sentiment Index survey. Who It’s Best ForInternational Van Lines is a great option for those requiring flexibility with their moving date due to its relaxed cancellation policy. However, customers who’d rather not deal with a deposit should check out some of the other options on this list.	Consumer Sentiment Index

Allied Van Lines excels in providing accurate quotes, which is very important to consumers who need to stick to a budget. Additionally, its long list of full-service moving options can give customers a completely hands-off experience.Learn more:
Allied Van Lines review	Why We Picked ItWe picked Allied Van Lines for multiple reasons, one being its thorough price-quoting process. The company has also received relatively positive customer feedback due in part to its customer-centric policies like no deposits and free cancellation until the move date. Why We Like ItBesides its dedication to accurate pricing, generous cancellation policy and $0 deposit, we like that Allied has a guaranteed delivery window, something not all companies offer. Additionally, the company provides a wide range of specialty services like piano and pool table shipping, storage and oversized hauling. What We Don’t LikeAlthough Allied Van Lines usually receives good reviews, there are some instances of customer dissatisfaction, especially in customer service and communication of moving days. We’d also like to see a live chat function added to the website, as it provides a great alternative for those who multitask on their phones or computers. Who It’s Best ForAllied Van Lines is a good fit for those who value accurate pricing, flexibility and a wide range of services. Those who want peace of mind with guaranteed prices and delivery dates will likely enjoy Allied’s services. However, those on a tight budget may need to look elsewhere.	Consumer Sentiment Index

Solomon & Sons Relocation Services is rather new to the moving industry, with only about a decade of experience. However, it makes up for that with the variety of services it provides at reasonable prices. 	Why We Picked ItNot only does the company have a large catalog of services at fair prices, but Solomon & Sons also includes features like GPS tracking, binding quotes, price matching and a guaranteed delivery window. Why We Like ItSolomon & Sons Relocation Services already has competitive pricing, but on top of that, it offers discounts such as its $150 discount for military moves. These two factors can give the customer great value and make long-distance moves more achievable.What We Don’t LikeThe 20% deposit required to secure a moving date could be difficult for some as it’s a relatively high upfront cost. We’d also like to see some additional convenience features, such as live chat and a mobile app.Who It’s Best ForSolomon & Sons is a budget-friendly option for families seeking a long-distance mover. It’s an especially good choice if you are certain of your moving dates and don’t mind putting down a deposit. 	Consumer Sentiment Index

When Might You Need a Long-Distance Moving Company?
Every moving company will define a long-distance move a little differently. Generally, though, here’s how to know when you might need a long-distance moving company versus a local mover.
Your move crosses state lines: Some moving companies define a long-distance move as any move that crosses into another state. Even if you live right on the border to your new home state, any moving company that handles that move will need to be licensed as an interstate mover, so hiring a long-distance company can help ensure that.
Your move is over 100 miles: This metric is one that some movers use to define a “long-distance” move. Keep in mind though, that we also came across definitions like over 50 miles or over 400 miles, so there is still some wiggle room here. Still, if you’re moving over 100 miles, chances are you’ll need a long-distance moving company able to take on that task.
Your move is to another country: It’s probably no surprise that an international move will require a long-distance moving company (again, even if you’re, say, moving to Canada from a bordering state like New York). Hiring a long-distance mover usually helps ensure that the company has the proper licensing for an international move and is able to handle all the paperwork involved. Still, it never hurts to seek out companies that specifically bill themselves as international movers.

What to Look for in a Long-Distance Moving Company
Taking care to choose the best long-distance moving company for you can help make the experience run more smoothly. Keep the following things in mind:
1. Years In Business
The number of years in business can be a good indicator of a company’s reliability and experience. If you are choosing a larger national company for your long-distance move, make sure it has experience in your particular location.
2. Broker vs. Carrier
When researching the best long-distance moving companies, it’s a good idea to find out if each potential moving company is a broker or a carrier. A reputable company will be upfront with this information, so don’t be afraid to ask.
A carrier directly works on your move. It uses its own staff and trucks to physically transport your belongings. A broker, on the other hand, acts as an intermediary by coordinating the move and matching you up with a carrier. If the company is a broker, it is especially important to research and make sure that it has a reliable process for vetting carriers.
All of the companies listed above are carriers except International Van Lines, which is a broker, and United Van Lines which works as a broker for local moves but a carrier for everything else.
3. Service Options
Depending on your particular move, you may be looking for specific services. Many moving companies offer packing and unpacking, furniture assembly and disassembly and local and long-distance moving services. However, less common services include junk removal, vehicle shipping and international moving. If you require a specific service, make sure your chosen company offers it. Companies with a reputation for doing excellent work in a specific service niche might be a good differentiator when it comes time to narrow down your options.
4. Customer Experience
One of the most important things you can do while researching a company is looking at reviews. Be sure to look at reviews from a variety of platforms, like the BBB, Trustpilot and Google Maps. Some larger companies may have hundreds of reviews. Focus on the most recent reviews first and those with two to four stars, as they’ll likely give you the most relevant and holistic view of the company.
Besides reviews, consider the tools and resources each company provides to its customers. Some companies may offer 24/7 live chat, phone services or GPS shipment tracking, for instance.
5. Transparency
Transparency is perhaps the most important thing to consider while searching for a moving company. You want to work with companies that are clear, straightforward and willing to answer your questions. Be wary of any company that dodges questions about pricing, licensing, contracts, cancellation or insurance. A quick way to check a company’s legitimacy and test its transparency is to ask for its USDOT number. Any moving company that travels over state lines must have one per federal regulations. From there, you can look it up on the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration’s (FMCSA) website and view a company’s record.
What are three red flags to look out for in your moving contract?
1. Are there any obvious errors, such as date, customer name and price?
2. Does the contract include any fees or additional charges that you weren’t informed about?
3. Does the contract name a different moving company than the one you hired?

How Much Do Long-Distance Moving Companies Cost?
The cost of a long-distance move depends on several factors, including the total volume of things that need to be transported and the distance of the journey. However, you can expect to pay an average of
$3,000 to $4,000 for a 1,000-mile move. However, depending on the specifics of your move, it can be as high as
$17,000. Another way to look at it is to expect to pay around
$20 to
$40 per hour per mover.
3 Tips for Getting the Best Moving Price
Compare multiple quotes. Once you’ve gathered quotes from a few different companies, you can use them to negotiate with your preferred company.
Choose an off-time. For the best price, book your move during the off-season, which runs from late fall through early spring. Additionally, moving on weekdays tends to be cheaper than moving on weekends.
Look for deals and promotions. Sign up for your chosen company’s newsletter or social media accounts for the best chance of finding limited-time discounts.

Factors That Influence the Cost of Long-Distance Moving
A variety of factors can drastically influence how much you’ll pay for your long-distance move. Below, we’ll highlight the major aspects of calculating a long-distance move quote:
Type of moving service chosen: If you’re opting for a full-service move, you can expect to pay more than if you opted for a moving container or a partially DIY move. Also, add-on services like packing and unpacking or storage can add to the total cost of your long distance move.
Distance: Naturally, how much distance you’re covering from your origin to your destination will impact your final cost. A 600-mile move, for example, will likely cost you less than a coast-to-coast, multi-day move.
When you’re moving: Seasonality affects the moving industry’s pricing throughout the year. If you can wait till the off-season (November to April) to move, you may pay less than during peak season (May to October). On another note, if you’re moving to or from an area prone to winter storms during the winter, you may also see a hike in costs to cover any incidents or delays as a result of the inclement weather.
How much you’re moving: Do you have a one-bedroom apartment’s worth of items to move, or do you need enough room in the moving truck for four bedrooms’ worth? The volume and weight of your items will make a major difference in your final invoice.
How To Pack for a Long-Distance Move
Strategic and thoughtful packing is essential for any move but is especially vital for a long-distance move. Luckily, we have a few tips and tricks to help you optimize your packing.
1. Declutter Before Packing
The more items you have, the more expensive your move will be. If you have things you no longer want or need, now’s a good time to get rid of them. Focus especially on bulky or heavy items like furniture or fragile items that require extra packaging like glassware. If you plan far enough in advance, you can host a garage or moving sale to make a little extra cash. There are also platforms like Facebook Marketplace or Craigslist that are great for selling unwanted items. Whatever you don’t sell can be donated or recycled.
2. Utilize Free Packing Supplies
While you wouldn’t expect to pay a lot for cardboard and bubble wrap, when buying enough to move a whole house, packing supplies can add up. Before going out to buy boxes, see if you have any family, friends or neighbors who have recently moved or local businesses that might be willing to give you some for free. You can also try to use things like suitcases or laundry baskets for transporting your less breakable objects. Instead of bubble wrap, use towels, linens and old clothes to wrap your fragile items. Alternatively, old newspapers, magazine pages, and paper and plastic grocery bags make great bubble wrap alternatives.
3. Label Everything
The last thing you want to do after a long day of moving is dig through 12 different boxes to find a towel, a bottle of soap or your favorite cozy blanket. That’s why it’s important to label all of your boxes (on multiple sides). At the very least, label which room the box belongs in, but if you want to save some extra time from digging later, list the main items in each box too.
4. Pack an Essentials Bag
Packing an essentials bag can be a good idea for any move, but it’s especially important for long-distance moves, which may see you separated from your things for multiple days. At a minimum, the essentials bag should include items like a change of clothes, toiletries, charging cables and any medications. Additionally, consider adding snacks, a towel, a roll of toilet paper and some hand soap.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
How do you know if a moving company is legit?
One of the best ways to determine a long-distance moving company’s legitimacy is to look at its USDOT number. All moving companies that cross state lines are required to have one. You can check a company’s USDOT number on the FMCSA website.
How can I save money on a long-distance move?
One of the best ways to save money on a long-distance move is to do all the packing yourself. In fact, the more you can do yourself, the better. For instance, if you are comfortable driving, consider renting a truck instead of hiring people to drive it. In the end, this can save you a lot of money. If a DIY approach isn’t for you. Try to move during the off-season to save a little extra cash. Winter is typically the cheapest time to move, while summer and early fall are the most expensive.
How far in advance should I hire long-distance movers?
Typically, it’s recommended that you book your moving company at least two months before your moving date. However, if you are planning a move during the summer or early fall, you may want to schedule your moving service even earlier.
How do I know if a moving company is legit?
Verify that any mover you’re working with has the proper licensing for long-distance moving by looking up its USDOT number. All companies that perform interstate moves need one and looking it up will also show you the company’s safety rating and other info. You can also look at online reviews to get a fuller picture, but the licensing will be most important.
Do moving companies offer GPS tracking?
Many long-distance movers will offer GPS tracking, but if this is a non-negotiable for you, we suggest asking companies upfront if this is something they offer. Keep in mind that this may also look different company by company.
