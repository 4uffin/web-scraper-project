Nearly 40% of advisors today are expected to retire in the next decade, according to research from Cerulli Associates, underscoring the critical need for new talent in the business. There are promising signs of improvement, however: Some 57% of new CFP certificants last year were under age 35, and the class hit a new record level of gender and ethnic diversity. This year’s Forbes | SHOOK list of America’s Top Next-Gen Advisors features 100 rising stars in the field of financial advice. All these young advisors were born in 1986 or later and cumulatively manage nearly $256 billion in assets.CLICK HERE FOR THE METHODOLOGY.Kayvon SarmadiFirm: UBS Wealth ManagementLocation: Washington, D.C.Team Assets (Custodied): $974 million“You never know who you’re going to run into, so dressing well still matters.”VIEW PROFILEKatie HancockFirm: Morgan Stanley Wealth ManagementLocation: Tuscaloosa, ALTeam Assets (Custodied): $4.2 billion“Volatility is not the enemy. The real risk is not understanding asset allocation and not being able to meet long-term goals.”VIEW PROFILEData provided by SHOOK® Research, LLC. Data as of 3/31/25. Forbes America’s Top Next-Gen Wealth Advisors ranking was developed by SHOOK Research and is based on in-person, virtual, and telephone due diligence meetings to evaluate each advisor qualitatively, a major component of the ranking algorithm that includes: client impact, industry experience, credentials, review of compliance records, firm nominations; and quantitative criteria, such as: assets under management and revenue generated for their firms. SHOOK considered advisors born in 1986 or later with a minimum 4 years as an advisor. Advisors have: built their own practices and lead their teams; joined teams and are viewed as future leadership; or a combination of both. Investment performance is not a criterion because client objectives and risk tolerances vary, and advisors rarely have audited performance reports. SHOOK’s research and rankings provide opinions intended to help investors choose the right financial advisor and are not indicative of future performance or representative of any one client’s experience. Past performance is not an indication of future results. Neither Forbes nor SHOOK Research receive compensation in exchange for placement on the ranking.
