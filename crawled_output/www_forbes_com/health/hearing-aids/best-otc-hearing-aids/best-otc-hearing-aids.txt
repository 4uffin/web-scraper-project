In fact, all three testers rated the hearing aid a 4 out of 5 stars for overall sound quality of speech. Participants also appreciated the control center within the Elehear app, which provided a user-friendly experience. Included in the purchase of this OTC product is a pair of hearing aids, charging case, nine sets of ear domes, one set of wax guards, one cleaning tool, one USB-C cable, a quick start guide and a user manual.“Consumers appreciate the ease of setup with this device, rechargeability and volume controls that can be adjusted independently on [the] right and left ears. Additionally, the tinnitus maskers with this device are an added bonus. Overall, Elehear Beyond has an impressive number of controls for its price point.” Amy Sarow, Au.D., audiologist and Forbes Health Advisory Board member	Pros & ConsOffers real-time artificial intelligence (AI) speech translation, as well as advanced AI noise reductionPurchase includes a one-year warrantyHearing aid is highly customizable via the Elehear app, according to focus group feedbackManufacturer offers a 45-day risk-free trialOnly available in two colorsAdditional charge incurred if user requires a longer receiver length than standard offeringOne participant experienced odd “chorus” effect when listening to pure tones or music in focus group testingShorter battery life compared to similar products	Proprietary Testing Insights for Elehear BeyondSound Quality: Elehear Beyond scored a 73 out of 100 in sound clarity based on laboratory data.Noise Reduction Performance: Scored 4.3 out of 5 based on focus group participant responses.Customization: Offers a personalized experience via the Elehear app, which focus group participants enjoyed (particularly the “speech focus” feature).Speech Clarity in Loud Environments: Scored 74 out of 100 based on laboratory testing results.Comfort Score: Rated 4.3 out of 5 based on participant feedback specific to this model.From Our Focus Group Participants Three individuals tested the Elehear Beyond. Steven, a first-time hearing aid user, found the device easy to set up and comfortable to wear, as well as enhancing sound volume and clarity. Two other participants, Jim (a first-time hearing aid user) and Timothy (who currently uses hearing aids), agreed the device immediately improved sound. All three reviewers said they were able to insert the hearing aids into their ears without difficulty. They also appreciated the features within the app and the level of control allotted when adjusting the hearing aid’s settings.“Better isolation features than the other OTCs I’ve tried.” – Timothy, 65, Bellingham, Washington, Product Tester“[I] really like the all-around or front-facing mode.” – Steven, 59, Bellingham, Washington, Product Tester

Users can adjust volume control, sound balance and directionality of this self-fitting, OTC hearing aid all from its accompanying app. Its features include wind noise reduction, which improves outdoor sounds, advanced acoustic processing, which provides for ease of listening, impact sound smoothing technology for sudden loud noises and more. It also boasts an impressive battery life of up to 26 hours and comes with four sizes of ear tips.

While he experienced a strange “flanging” or “chorus” effect while listening to music and pure tones, he found the hearing aid to be comfortable and stayed in place well.In comparison to other hearing aids he’s used, the Sony CRE-E10 was more noticeable than his behind-the-ear (BTE) hearing aids, but the experience was overall similar. Timothy added that while sounds were quite loud, and frequencies may have been amplified that shouldn’t have been, there was adequate “headroom” for additional amplification, if necessary. Though he experienced some minor connection difficulties initially, he found the tone setting to be useful and said all voices seemed to be amplified in a crowded room.“Quite easy to insert. I like the shape of the dome/eartip. They seem to stay in place fairly well.” – Timothy, 65, Bellingham, Washington, Product Tester

All ratings are determined solely by our editorial team.Price: $999.95Type: Receiver-in-canal (RIC)Hearing loss: Mild or moderateBluetooth connectivity: Compatible with iOS and AndroidBattery life: Up to 16 hours	Shop Now	On Sennheiser's Website Why We Chose Sennheiser All-Day ClearThis device stands out for its self-fitting capability, meaning an audiologist may not need to adjust the aid for comfort and performance. Instead, users can set up and fit the device on their own time with the help of the Sennheiser Smart Control app. In addition to the hearing aids, a purchase of Sennheiser All-Day Clear comes with a USB charging cable, wall plug, wax guards, cleaning brush, instruction manual, pair of hearing aids and small, medium and large eartips.“An affordable OTC hearing aid with excellent sound quality from a well-known brand. It is rechargeable and has Bluetooth streaming capabilities for both Androids and iPhones.” – Lindsey Banks, Au.D., audiologist and Forbes Health Advisory Board member	Pros & ConsUsers can create their own sound profileIn-clinic care package add-on includes an additional year of manufacturer’s warrantyAutomatically detects and optimizes sound based on your environmentCompany offers an optional premium service, which includes additional support from a licensed hearing care professionalUnable to connect to app or Bluetooth during focus group testingShort battery life compared to other products on this listDoesn’t feature tinnitus management controlsUser reviews on the product page note charging port may be outdated	Proprietary Testing Insights for Sennheiser All-Day ClearSound Quality: The Sennheiser All-Day Clear scored an 80 out of 100 in sound clarity, according to laboratory testing.Noise Reduction Performance: Not scored due to Bluetooth connectivity malfunction during focus group.Customization: Unable to confirm customization features or capacity during focus group testing.Speech Clarity in Loud Environments: Scored 78 out of 100 based on laboratory data.Comfort Score: Rated 3 out of 5, based on focus group participant feedback specific to this model.From Our Focus Group Participant While our focus group participant, Steven, was unable to achieve a Bluetooth connection between the Sennheiser All-Day Clear and its accompanying app, he rated the hearing aid a 3 out of 5 for comfort, a 4 out of 5 for ease of set up, a 4 out of 5 for appearance and a 3 out of 5 for speech quality.
Zepp Clarity Pixie Hearing Aid
4.7
All ratings are determined solely by our editorial team.Price: $1,999.00Type: In-the-ear (ITE)Hearing loss: Mild or moderateBluetooth connectivity: Compatible with iOS and AndroidBattery life: Up to 17 hours Why We Chose Zepp Clarity Pixie During our focus group testing, our participant particularly appreciated the shape and feel of this hearing aid. Additionally, she rated the Zepp Clarity Pixie a 5 out of 5 for both comfort and appearance. However, the device produced high sound distortion, squealing and feedback in our focus group testing, so it may be best for you if comfort reigns supreme.“A good invisible-ish OTC hearing aid.” – Abram Bailey, Au.D., audiologist and Forbes Health Advisory Board member	Pros & Cons60-day risk- free return and 24-month limited warrantyLess visible compared to some modelsEasy to insert, per our focus group participantComfortable shape, per our focus group participantHigher price point compared to other models on this listDoesn’t offer tinnitus management featuresShorter battery life compared to others on this listOnly recommended by one Forbes Health Advisory Board member	Proprietary Testing Insights for Zepp Clarity PixieSound Quality: Zepp Clarity Pixie scored a 70 out of 100 in sound clarity, according to laboratory testing.Noise Reduction: Scored 1 out of 5 based on focus group data.Customization: Our focus group participant found the app to be unintuitive and was unable to make adjustments.Speech Clarity in Loud Environments: Scored 76 out of 100 based on laboratory data.Comfort Score: Rated 5 out of 5, based on user feedback specific to this model.From Our Focus Group Participant Our single Zepp Clarity Pixie tester, Meredith, had some difficulty customizing this hearing aid. However, she appreciated its shape and ease of insertion. While she awarded the device 5 out of 5 for comfort, she experienced high sound distortion, squealing and feedback while testing the device, even when using it in a sound booth. These concerns made her unable to leave the hearing aids in her ears for any extended amount of time. She did not find the crowd setting to successfully isolate voices in a noisy room and felt it did not help with tinnitus.“I like only the shape. The setup and audible feedback/distortion prohibited me from being able to leave them in.” – Meredith, 53, Bellingham, Washington, Product Tester
Lucid Engage Hearing Aid
4.7
All ratings are determined solely by our editorial team.Price: $649.99 Type: Receiver-in-canal (RIC) Hearing loss: Mild or moderate Bluetooth connectivity: Compatible with iOS and Android devices Battery life: Up to 16 hours
Why We Chose Lucid EngageIn our focus group testing, our participant appreciated the music quality and app pairing abilities of the Lucid Engage. We chose this hearing aid due to its unique speaker-in-the-ear format, which gives the wearer high definition natural sound with greater clarity, and it comes at a price point that won’t break the bank. With the purchase of these hearing aids, users can expect a cleaning tool, Size 13 batteries, 10 wax stops, nine pairs of assorted ear tips and a user manual. This product also comes with a one-year warranty.“RIC style (most preferred style) hearing aid with good sound performance test results.” – Abram Bailey, Au.D., audiologist and Forbes Health Advisory Board member	Pros & ConsAvailable in three colorsEasy to set up in focus group testingIncludes a free pair of hearing protection earplugs at checkoutMoisture-resistantOne of the shortest battery life options on this listTips and overall feel may be uncomfortable, per our product testerMay not be ideal for those with longer hair, per our product testerAdjustment and customization settings in app may be limited or difficult to navigate, per our product tester	Proprietary Testing Insights for Lucid EngageSound Quality: Lucid Engage scored a 73 out of 100 in sound clarity, according to laboratory testing.Noise Reduction Performance: Scored a 1 out of 5 based on focus group data.Customization: Our focus group participant appreciated being able to customize the amplification profile and was able to accurately toggle between streaming and ambiance.Speech Clarity in Loud Environments: Scored 76 out of 100 based on laboratory data.Comfort Score: Rated 2 out of 5, based on user feedback specific to this model.From Our Focus Group Participant Our tester for the Lucid Engage hearing aid, Margaret, was satisfied with how easy it was to insert the device. However, she found issues with the technicalities of the device. She found the feeling of the tips in the ears to be uncomfortable, saying her ear felt “full.” While she was comfortable using the accompanying app, she felt there weren’t enough ways to make adjustments and found customizing her amplification profile and toggling between streaming and ambience settings difficult. She also found the hearing aid did not isolate voices well in a crowded or noisy room.“I don’t love them and probably wouldn’t spend much money on them. The gain I get in speech in multitalker babble is not worth the background noise. Music quality and app pairing was good. Lack of individualization to [the] hearing profile. [I] like that they are rechargeable, but I would want a battery option as well.” – Maggie, 38, Bellingham, Washington, Product Tester

Methodology: How We Picked the Best OTC Hearing Aids of 2025
To determine the best OTC hearing aids, the Forbes Health editorial team consulted several audiologists on the Forbes Health Advisory Board for specific product recommendations based on their years of experience fitting various hearing aid models for a wide array of patients. Each expert was careful to consider the newest technology available in the hearing aid space when providing their recommendations, as well as newer brands and the roles they’re playing in this constantly evolving industry.
We also partnered with Western Washington University (WWU)’s audiology hearing department to conduct extensive laboratory testing, including sound quality, speech clarity and intelligibility (including smoothness, internal noise and bandwidth) and feedback resistance. Plus, two Forbes Health editors conducted an in-person focus group with five participants at WWU to explore OTC device comfort and functionality.
Star ratings were solely determined by the editorial team, based on detailed methodology points, including:
Ziphearing starting price for a pair/brand, starting price for a pair (OTC) and Hearing Tracker price for prescription: 20%
Speech intelligibility, sound quality, output and safety and responsiveness scores: 20%
Number of board members who recommend this hearing aid: 10%
If it has tinnitus management specific features: 10%
Whether it performs well for background noise reduction: 10%
If it performs well for music: 10%
If it has a disposable and rechargeable battery option and maximum battery life on a single charge (rechargeable only; in hours): 7.5%
Whether it is Bluetooth compatible and if it connects well with iOS and Android devices: 7.5%
Whether it has an app for customization, remote management, etc.: 5%
Starting price information is reflected from the device manufacturers themselves. All OTC hearing aids can be self-fitted.

How Do OTC Hearing Aids Work?
OTC hearing aids improve access to and affordability of these medical devices for adults with perceived mild to moderate hearing loss. These hearing aids are available at stores and online retailers without the need for a medical exam, prescription or fitting adjustment by an audiologist or hearing health professional.
Similar to prescription hearing aids, OTC hearing aids contain a microphone, amplifier and speaker. The microphone picks up sound and converts it into a digital signal, which is then amplified to increase the strength of that signal. The speaker then sends the amplified signal into the ear, providing a louder and clearer sound for the wearer.
Who May Benefit From OTC Hearing Aids?
“We know for sure that OTC hearing aids are for [adults with] perceived mild to moderate hearing loss, not severe (or worse) hearing loss,” says Dr. Cherukuri. “If you have some trouble hearing in crowds or you turn the television [volume] up a little bit, there’s a hearing aid for you in the OTC space.” However, he adds that OTC hearing aids won’t help people in need of stronger hearing assistance, such as those who need people to repeat themselves even in quiet settings or those who can only hear a TV at full volume.
Adults at least 18 years old with perceived mild to moderate hearing loss are eligible to purchase OTC hearing aids, but Dr. Cherukuri notes that older adults specifically are likely to benefit from this new product category, given their need for these devices.
If you’re wondering whether your hearing loss might benefit from an OTC hearing aid, here are signs you may have mild to moderate hearing loss:
You miss syllables and high-frequency consonants. For example, if someone says, “Let’s go to the pool,” you hear, “Let’s go to school,” or “Let’s go to tool.”
You frequently ask people to repeat themselves.
You have trouble understanding when someone whispers to you, such as in a movie theater or auditorium.
You often confuse similar words. For instance, when someone tells you “15 minutes,” you hear “50 minutes.”
You’ve started making behavioral modifications, such as sitting closer to a speaker during a weekly lecture or asking your spouse to stop talking to you from another room because you can’t hear them.

What Level of Hearing Loss Requires a Hearing Aid?
OTC hearing aids are intended for adults at least 18 years old with perceived mild to moderate hearing loss, states the FDA. Children and adults with severe to profound hearing loss still need to see a hearing health professional for an assessment and an appropriately fitted hearing aid.
There are four general degrees of hearing loss, according to the CDC.
Mild hearing loss, meaning individuals have difficulty hearing soft sounds but still able to hear some speech at a normal level.
Moderate hearing loss, meaning individuals can hear minimal speech when another person is talking at a normal level.
Severe hearing loss, meaning individuals are unable to hear another person speaking at a normal level, but they can hear some loud sounds.
Profound hearing loss, meaning individuals are unable to hear any speech and can only hear very loud sounds.
Other auditory problems may require medical treatment or a more personalized solution from a hearing specialist, according to the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, including:
Tinnitus, or ringing in one or both ears
Ear pain or discomfort
Sudden change or loss of hearing
History of earwax buildup
How Much Do OTC Hearing Aids Cost?
OTC hearing aids are typically more affordable than prescription hearing aids, which are often sold bundled with audiology services.
“We expect the consumer marketplace to help determine the cost of OTC hearing aids,” says Dr. Cherukuri. “Where the average price of a prescription hearing aid is $2,300, we expect OTC hearing aids to cost $300 to $1,000 for a pair. So they’re much more affordable. However, they’re not going to be custom programmed for a specific person’s hearing loss, and they won’t necessarily have all the advanced bells and whistles that a prescription product can have.”

What Types of Hearing Aids Are Available Over the Counter?
The FDA’s final rule regarding OTC hearing aids applies to certain devices that use air-conduction technology, which work by amplifying sound and sending it down the ear canal. This technology is used in most common hearing aids.
Traditional hearing aids are available in five main types, or styles.
Behind-the-ear (BTE): A small plastic case hooks behind the ear and delivers sound through a piece of clear tubing to an earmold placed in the ear.
Receiver-in-canal (RIC): Similar to a BTE, but the casing is smaller and more discreet. A very thin wire connects the hearing aid to the ear canal, allowing the ear canal to remain more open. Or, it can be coupled with an ear mold, depending on the severity of hearing loss.
In-the-ear (ITE): Casing holds all parts of the hearing aid and fills most of the outer ear. There are no external tubes.
In-the-canal (ITC): ITC aids are similar to ITE aids, but they’re smaller and fit directly in the ear canal.
Completely-in-canal (CIC): CIC aids fit directly in the ear canal like ITC aids, but are even smaller and less noticeable.
Pro Tip Did you know that over-the-counter (OTC) hearing aids are now widely available? Typically suitable for perceived mild to moderate hearing loss, OTC hearing aids can be found directly on brand websites as well as in retail stores and pharmacies like Best Buy and Walgreens.
The Benefits of OTC Hearing Aids
Only one in five people who would benefit from a hearing aid uses one, according to the Hearing Loss Association of America.[1]Summary Health Statistics for U.S. Adults: National Health Interview Survey, 2012. National Center for Health Statistics. Accessed 5/5/2023.
Cost, confusion about and access to hearing care, and gradual hearing loss going unrecognized are all reasons for this underutilization. Vanity also plays a role, though hearing aids continue to become smaller and sleeker.
“Having hearing loss is like you’re backing out 10 feet from a conversation,” says John Coverstone, an audiologist in New Brighton, Minnesota, and host of the AudiologyTalk podcast. “People feel more isolated,” he says.
Untreated hearing loss increases your risk of anxiety, depression, social isolation, falls and cognitive decline, research shows.
OTC hearing aids can help address the early stages of hearing loss as a person begins to experience hearing difficulty. By removing multiple barriers to entry—an audiology exam, a prescription and high costs—people can access this type of hearing aid faster and easier than prescription hearing aids, encouraging early intervention and, hopefully, improved health outcomes.
Why Do Hearing Aids Matter, and What Happens When Hearing Health is Neglected?
The primary function of hearing aids is to make speech audible for those suffering from hearing loss, says Dr. Bailey.
Aside from not hearing your best, untreated hearing loss can lead to social isolation, which increases the risk of developing chronic health conditions like heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure and dementia. Untreated hearing loss is also linked to anxiety, depression, dependence on others, lowered confidence and decreased earning potential.
Pros and Cons of Buying Hearing Aids Over the Counter

Potential Side Effects of OTC Hearing Aids
Wearing hearing aids—either prescription hearing aids or OTC hearing aids—can result in some side effects when not sized or used correctly, including:
Soreness around the ear where the hearing aid sits
Skin irritation
Itchiness in the ear canal
Trouble hearing properly
Headaches
Tinnitus
Excessive feedback from the hearing aid
With OTC hearing aids, incorrect wear could become more common since users aren’t required to see a hearing health professional to first diagnose their specific degree of hearing loss. Users who opt for OTC hearing aids also aren’t required to work with an audiologist to program the devices for their needs, so the potential for user error may be higher than that of prescription hearing aid users.

What to Consider Before Purchasing OTC Hearing Aids
As you learn about the types of hearing aids and their features and technologies, take these steps before making a purchase.
Shop around. Consider your options at in-person retailers offering OTC hearing aids and at your local hearing aid clinic or audiology office. “You’ll be surprised by the very little difference in price at some clinics where you can get a fully customized instrument with an audiologist or doctor helping you along the way,” says Dr. Cherukuri.
Get a hearing health examination. Hearing tests are especially easy to get, says Dr. Cherukuri, noting they’re available at a variety of places, almost always covered by insurance under a doctor’s order and sometimes even offered for free. Even though an exam isn’t required to purchase OTC hearing aids, confirm with a hearing health professional (such as an audiologist) that you do, in fact, have hearing loss that can be addressed with a hearing aid and the specific degree to which you’re experiencing hearing loss so you can explore hearing aid products designed for your situation. Online hearing tests are also available if you have the right equipment and environment at home, though they may not be as accurate as a test performed by a professional, he says.
Ask about a hearing aid trial period. When speaking with a retailer about OTC hearing aid options, ask if you can test them out for a given period of time to make sure they are the best fit for you. “In the traditional setting, it’s very common to get a patient to try two or three different models of hearing aids before they decide which one is the best fit—very similar to test driving a car. So it’s very important to read the fine print—including the return policy of the product,” notes Dr. Cherukuri.
Ask about the full capabilities of the hearing aid. Even if you only have moderate hearing loss now, that may change in the future, and hearing aids are expensive. Rather than planning for an additional purchase down the line, ask about hearing aids with adjustable settings to treat more significant levels of hearing loss in the future.
Gather warranty information. Most OTC hearing aids come with warranties on parts. Make sure you’re happy with the level of coverage the warranties provide.
Confirm that the manufacturer and specific hearing aid model is registered with the FDA. “The FDA is supposed to do an audit of the manufacturing facilities to make sure they’re following good manufacturing practices (GMPs) because these are medical devices—not simply consumer electronics,” explains Dr. Cherukuri. “Make sure it’s a reputable company following the regulations.”
How to Choose the Best OTC Hearing Aid for You
OTC hearing aids are designed to meet the needs of adults with mild to moderate hearing loss. The self-fitting hearing aids available on the market today, like Elehear Beyond and Sennheiser All Day Clear, are capable of meeting the needs of someone with mild to moderate hearing loss, so it comes down to your preferences on style and comfort, says Dr. Bailey.
The Elehear Beyond hearing aids fit behind the ear, with a small speaker resting in the ear canal. These [devices] will be super comfortable and easy to wear all day long. They will also leave your ear canals open, meaning no boomy voice or strange sounds while you’re chewing.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
Where can OTC hearing aids be purchased?
OTC hearing aids are available for purchase at brick-and-mortar retailers like Walgreens, Best Buy, CVS and Walmart. Hearing aid manufacturer websites including Elehear, Sennheiser, Sony, Lucid and Zepp also sell OTC hearing aids directly.
How do I know if I need OTC hearing aids?
It’s important to consult with a hearing health professional or audiologist to determine your degree of hearing loss and which hearing aids might benefit you the most. Ultimately, your audiologist can advise whether OTC or prescription hearing aids are appropriate for your unique hearing needs, as OTC hearing aids aren’t effective for severe or profound hearing loss.
Do OTC hearing aids need to be cleaned?
Yes, OTC hearing aids require routine cleaning as part of their maintenance. Many OTC hearing aids come with a brush for cleaning. Read the instruction manual of your OTC hearing aids to learn how to clean them properly, or visit a hearing specialist for assistance.
Are there OTC hearing aids that are small and don’t show?
In-the-canal (ITC) or completely-in-canal (CIC) hearing aids fit directly in the ear for a discreet, almost invisible appearance.
What if my hearing gets worse after I buy OTC hearing aids?
If you suspect your degree of hearing loss is worsening, make an appointment with your audiologist, who can recommend the best treatment for your needs. Before you purchase OTC hearing aids, it’s important to note the degrees of hearing loss the hearing aids support, as well as what adjustable settings they feature.
Are OTC hearing aids as good as prescription hearing aids?
OTC hearing aids are designed to support people with perceived mild to moderate hearing loss but aren’t intended to replace prescription hearing aids, which can address more severe degrees of hearing loss. However, depending on the model and the individual in need of hearing health care, an OTC hearing aid and a prescription hearing aid programmed for mild or moderate hearing loss needs can provide comparable benefits.
How long do OTC hearing aids last?
Most hearing aids typically last three to seven years. Some factors that affect the lifespan of hearing aids include how they’re cleaned, how they’re stored, what environmental elements (like moisture) they’re exposed to over time and how frequently they’re serviced.
Are OTC Hearing Aids Worth It?
“I think the OTC hearing aid category is a good thing because it will increase access, especially for those with a more limited budget or who may be hesitant about getting help,” says Dr. Sarow. “There are millions of Americans who could benefit from amplification but are discouraged due to the cost or stigma of hearing aids.”
