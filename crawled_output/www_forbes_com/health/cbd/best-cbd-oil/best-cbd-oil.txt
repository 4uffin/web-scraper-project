Commissions we earn from partner links on this page do not affect our opinions or evaluations. Our editorial content is based on thorough research and guidance from the Forbes Health Advisory Board.
Consuming products formulated with cannabidiol (CBD) may offer numerous health benefits, from reducing anxiety to improving quality of sleep and more. In fact, a Forbes Health survey of 2,000 U.S. adults conducted by OnePoll found 60% of respondents have tried a CBD product and believe it offers some medicinal benefits.
However, with so many CBD oils and tinctures available (and a lack of federal regulation), consumers may not know where or how to begin their search for a safe and effective product. To assist readers in their search, Forbes Health deeply analyzed 23 data points—including ingredients, potency, and more—on over 150 CBD oil products. From there, we sent our top CBD oils to a laboratory for testing of potency, quality and presence of contaminants. Here are the CBD oils that made it to our top ten.
Why You Can Trust Forbes Health
The Forbes Health editorial team prioritizes the accuracy and integrity of the data collected. Our ranking is based on quantitative data and is free from conflicts of interest. We carefully fact check the information featured in our ranking and are committed to producing rankings and supplemental content about CBD that readers can trust. You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our CBD methodology for the rankings below.

Best CBD Oil of 2025
When reviewing CBD oil product details, including the results of the third-party laboratory certificates of analysis (COAs), it’s important to clarify several key terms:
Cannabidiol (CBD): One of the most abundant, non-intoxicating psychoactive compounds in the cannabis sativa plant that research indicates may offer a number of health benefits, such as sleep and anxiety support
Delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC): One of the most abundant active compounds in the cannabis sativa plant that produces the intoxicating, psychoactive “high” often associated with cannabis (not to exceed 0.03% by dry weight in any product according to the 2018 Farm Bill)
Terpenes: Active compounds responsible for a plant’s aroma, as well as potentially health-promoting properties like antibacterial and antimicrobial effects
Mycotoxins: Toxins produced by a variety of molds (fungi) that can contaminate food and negatively affect health if consumed
Pesticides: Chemical substances used for pest control, primarily in farmed or cultivated land and domestic environments; exposure in large quantities may pose a threat to human health
Heavy metals: Naturally occurring essential and non-essential metals that can be dangerous to human health when consumed in high concentrations
Homogeneity: Measurement indicating potency is equal from one product to another
Note: Forbes Health submitted specific batches and potencies of each CBD oil to Nova Analytic Labs for testing, and batch results may vary.

Meanwhile, in addition to containing almost 30 milligrams of CBD per 0.5-milliliter serving, this oil also contains a variety of cannabinoids and terpenes, which may enhance its beneficial health effects. However, this product’s potency varies from the label per results of Forbes Health-facilitated testing, meaning it’s more potent than a consumer may anticipate.Redeem Therapeutics Broad-Spectrum CBD Tincture has a five-star rating on the manufacturer website, with some reviews expressing appreciation of the product’s potential to relieve arthritis pain.

Why We Picked ItWith a low potency, this Redeem CBD oil may be a good choice for someone looking to tend to mild to moderate symptoms of anxiety or pain, according to the company. It may also be a quality option for someone new to CBD looking to experience the effects of a full-spectrum oil. What’s more, consumers can choose between a graduated glass dropper or spray applicator, depending on their desired form of application. Reviews posted on the manufacturer’s website emphasize Redeem Therapeutics Full Spectrum CBD Oil’s potential to be used as a sleep aid. Redeem Therapeutics was also lauded by users for its well-designed packaging and fast shipping of a product that tastes great.

Why We Picked ItWhile this CBD oil is one of the most expensive on our list, it’s available in a range of potencies (1,000 milligrams, 3,000 milligrams and 6,000 milligrams), making it more accessible in terms of price and suitable for customers with a range of CBD experience levels and strength preferences. Of note, the measured CBD potency is over 5 milligrams per serving higher than the label suggests, per Forbes Health facilitated laboratory testing, meaning some customers may find the potency too high for their needs or comfort level.

Why We Picked ItCarmen’s Medicinals full-spectrum CBD oil contains a simple ingredient list, including full-spectrum hemp oil, peppermint oil and medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) oil from coconut. The 1,500-milligram version offers a moderate potency, and two additional potencies are available as well (3,000 milligrams and 6,000 milligrams). While it’s rich in cannabinoids, this oil is lacking measurable amounts of THC, according to third-party laboratory testing facilitated by Forbes Health. Some consumers purchasing a full-spectrum oil may prefer or expect THC to be present for various reasons. User reviews on the manufacturer website say Carmen’s Medicinals CBD Oil is a “high-quality product that delivers real results.” Aspects like its subtle taste and potential for stress relief are what make this product popular, according to posted reviews.

Why We Picked ItThis affordable, mid-range potency oil is rich in cannabinoids and terpenes, which may enhance its therapeutic effects. Because it’s full spectrum, it also contains small amounts of THC, which the company clearly highlights on the product page and warns may appear on a drug test. Unlike many oils on our list, however, this product lacks USDA organic certification, which may be a drawback for some CBD consumers. The ingredient list is also somewhat vague, listing “natural flavors” without further specifics. Reviews published on the manufacturer website suggest the Venna Full Spectrum CBD tincture is excellent for sleep and relaxation, with one customer saying the product has provided “more sleep than I have gotten in years.” 	Pros & ConsContains additional cannabinoids, including cannabichromene (CBC) and cannabigerol (CBG) and cannabinol (CBN), according to third-party testing results, which may promote enhanced benefits through the entourage effectTested CBD potency matches the label within 5 milligrams per servingNon GMOCompany offers a 30-day money-back guaranteeCompany website features a comprehensive dosing guide, including information about microdosingTincture includes clear measurement markings for easy dosageSingle flavor option may not appeal to all customersNot suitable for consumers looking for a THC-free productOnly available in two potencies (1,500 milligrams and 3,000 milligrams)

Why We Picked ItThis straightforward CBD isolate oil may be the perfect choice for a customer who knows they only want to ingest CBD. The low potency option may be ideal for CBD newcomers and experienced users alike, and the company claims this isolate is as effective as other types of CBD. This product is lacking the USDA-certified organic seal, which may deter some consumers. On the other hand, with just two ingredients, organic fractionated coconut oil and CBD isolate from hemp oil, the oil offers a minimal ingredient list for individuals looking for a simple product. Plus, subscribing can save consumers up to 55% off the original cost, lowering the price to $22.48 per bottle.User reviews on the manufacturer website praise this CBD isolate as a calming product offered at a good price. It’s described as an “excellent product” and “really good stuff.”	Pros & ConsTested CBD potency matches the label within 5 milligrams per servingContains no artificial flavors or sweetenersSubscription option saves customers 55% off the original priceSuitable for consumers looking for a THC-free product, according to third-party laboratory testing facilitated by Forbes HealthProduct page features COA highlights for customers to consider without needing to view the full documentsProduct label features clear dosing instructionsSingle potency availableNot all ingredients are organic, according to the product labelDoesn’t include terpenes to enhance therapeutic effects

Methodology: How We Picked the Best CBD Oils and Tinctures in 2025
To choose the best CBD oils and tinctures, the Forbes Health editorial team analyzed data on over approximately 100 CBD oil products that are:
Made from plants grown in the U.S.
Have a COA confirming the absence of pesticides, heavy metals and molds
Are third-party tested by ISO 17025-compliant laboratories
We then ranked CBD oils and tinctures based on price, potency, flavor options and more, including:
Price per serving (lowest potency available) (30%)
CBD per serving (lowest potency available) (30%)
Whether the product is organic (10%)
Whether the product contains all-natural ingredients (10%)
Whether the product is gluten-free (5%)
Whether the product is vegan-friendly (5%)
Whether the product is non-GMO (5%)
Number of flavor options available (5%)
We evaluated 30-milliliter bottles when possible to keep all data comparable and considered a standard serving size to be 1 milliliter of CBD oil unless otherwise specified by a product’s label.

Third-Party Laboratory Testing Methodology: How We Tested CBD Oils
Nova Analytic Labs
Forbes Health facilitated independent, third-party laboratory testing for the top CBD oils in our rankings through Nova Analytic Labs in Portland, Maine. The laboratory was selected to evaluate CBD oil potency and quality due to its strict standards and commitment to consumer safety.
Lab technicians used between 0.5 milliliters to 1 milliliter of oil to evaluate the following elements of each top-ranking CBD oil:
CBD potency
THC potency
Minor cannabinoid types potencies
Presence or absence and types of terpenes
Pesticide, mycotoxin, microbial and heavy metal detection
Nova Analytic Labs generated COAs for each top-ranking CBD oil based on these testing results, detailing specific cannabinoid and terpene potencies, as well as any indication of potentially harmful contaminants. Samples with non-detectable, or lower than measurable, levels of mycotoxins, microbes and heavy metals received a “pass.” The Forbes Health editorial team carefully examined each laboratory-provided COA, comparing them to the COAs originally published by each CBD brand and evaluating factors that would lead to potential disqualification, including:
THC levels surpassing the federally allowed amount of 0.3% by dry weight
Any presence of pesticides, mycotoxins, microbes or heavy metals above the safety threshold adhered to by the third-party laboratory based on state guidelines
What Is CBD Oil?
Cannabidiol (CBD) oil is a supplement derived from the cannabis sativa plant. Once CBD is extracted from the plant, it’s mixed with a carrier oil—often olive, coconut or medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) oil—to create CBD oil, which is then consumed orally.
How Do CBD Oils and Tinctures Work?
CBD works through the endocannabinoid system (ECS), a cell-signaling system. The ECS is made up of cannabinoids produced by the body naturally, receptors that respond to those cannabinoids and enzymes that help break them down and put them to use. When you consume CBD through a CBD oil or CBD tincture, your body responds the same way it does to its natural cannabinoids.
“Endocannabinoids are chemical messengers that play a variety of roles in the body,” explains Daniele Piomelli, Ph.D., the director of the Institute for the Study of Cannabis at the University of California, Irvine and an anatomy and neurobiology professor at the university’s medical school. “They work by binding to receptors present on the surface of neurons and many other cells. When bound to endocannabinoids, these receptors regulate appetite, pain, memory, the response to stress and the ability to store fat (among other things).”
Research suggests the ECS plays a role in several physiological processes, including appetite, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, fertility, immune function, memory, neuroprotection and pain modulation. People who consume CBD oil products often report relief for a variety of ailments, from anxiety to chronic pain.

How to Choose the Best CBD Oil for You
Because CBD oils and tinctures are considered dietary supplements and aren’t regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), consumers need to do their own research to ensure the quality of the product they choose to try. Here are a few criteria to consider when shopping for CBD oil:
U.S. sourcing. “Knowing the source of the hemp used in making a CBD product is important because it gives you insight into [a variety of components],” says Vanessa Niles, M.D., founder of Synergy Health Medical Marijuana Evaluation Clinic. Source information can indicate whether the hemp is sustainably farmed, organic, contains pesticides, heavy metals or other fertilizer chemicals, as well as if it’s been tested by a third-party laboratory. The FDA doesn’t regulate CBD oil products specifically, but it does regulate the cannabis sativa plants grown on U.S. soil, requiring that they contain no more than 0.3% THC by dry weight. (THC, or tetrahydrocannabinol, is the most well-known psychoactive compound found in the cannabis sativa plant, and some states have yet to legalize it due to its mind-altering effects.) Buying CBD oil sourced from hemp grown in the U.S. ensures the product you’re using meets these legal requirements.
Third-party testing. By sending samples of a product to an independent and accredited laboratory for testing, a company can ensure safety and security standards are being met, which is important for supplements like CBD oil.
Certificate of Analysis (COA) availability. This document is supplied by the third-party laboratory to confirm whether the CBD product meets the specifications advertised on its label. It also acknowledges any presence of pesticides, heavy metals or molds, which can be harmful to human health. Look for a CBD brand that transparently provides COAs for its products on its website.
Experts recommend exclusively shopping for CBD products from companies that have their products tested by third-party laboratories and provide recent COAs on their website or in the product packaging to ensure you’re consuming what the label suggests. Even with these two boxes checked, you can’t be too careful. A small 2023 study conducted by supplement company NextEvo Naturals and performed by Coral Reef Labs found large inconsistencies between COAs and product labels for 50% of 16 randomly selected CBD products purchased from large chain retailers in Pennsylvania locations and online. Most CBD gummy products tested didn’t contain as much CBD as their labels suggested while the CBD oil and capsule products exceeded the CBD amounts listed on their labels.[1]Rapin L, Gamaoun R, El Hage C, Fernanda M, Prosk E. Cannabidiol use and effectiveness: real-world evidence from a Canadian medical cannabis clinic. Journal of Cannabis Research. 2012;3(1):19.
What to Look for in CBD Oil Companies
First and foremost, reputable CBD oil companies submit their products to third-party laboratories for testing and make the resulting certificates of analysis (COAs) easily available to consumers. In terms of quality, look for companies that use organic, non-GMO, U.S.-grown hemp to manufacture their oils.
A Google search of a company or product may also bring up helpful reviews from third-party websites like TrustPilot, and you can always take a look at the company’s Better Business Bureau (BBB) profile for more information. If you’re unsure about a CBD oil company’s trustworthiness or reputation, speak with a cannabis provider for company and product recommendations.
What Are the Three Different Types of CBD Oil?
Hemp-derived CBD oil products can contain detectable amounts (no more than 0.3% by dry weight) of THC, the compound in cannabis plants known for causing intoxicatingly psychoactive effects.
However, consuming CBD won’t get you “high.” Instead, CBD interacts with receptors in your body’s endocannabinoid system (ECS), which includes the brain and spinal cord, potentially calming the central nervous system, alleviating anxiety, improving sleep quality and/or reducing inflammation and chronic pain symptoms.
Understanding the differences between the three types of CBD—full-spectrum CBD, broad-spectrum CBD and CBD isolate—can help you choose the best type for your specific needs and preferences.
Full Spectrum CBD
Full-spectrum CBD refers to a hemp extract that contains CBD and other compounds naturally present in the hemp plant, such as terpenes (compounds responsible for the way a plant smells) and minor amounts of THC, says Jeff Chen, M.D. co-founder and CEO of Radicle Science, a wellness clinical research organization in San Diego, and founder and former executive director of the UCLA Cannabis Research Initiative, one of the first multidisciplinary academic programs dedicated to the study of cannabis and cannabinoids.
CBD, terpenes, flavonoids, essential oils and other cannabinoids contained in full-spectrum CBD products can work synergistically to create what’s known as the “entourage effect,” which some research indicates may increase therapeutic benefits of CBD compared to when it’s used alone.
Broad Spectrum CBD
Broad-spectrum CBD is a hemp extract similar to full-spectrum CBD, with the exception that it typically undergoes an additional extraction process to remove all THC while leaving the remaining compounds naturally present in the hemp plant intact. With that said, testing reveals that some broad-spectrum CBD products retain minimal traces of THC, so it’s safest to refer to them as “nearly THC-free.”
CBD Isolate
As the name suggests, CBD isolate, or pure CBD, doesn’t contain any THC or other compounds from the hemp plant, says Dr. Chen. Unlike full-spectrum CBD and broad-spectrum CBD, CBD isolate cannot create the entourage effect because the extraction method isolates CBD from all other terpenes, cannabinoids and plant compounds naturally occurring in hemp.
Health Benefits of CBD Oil
Research suggests taking CBD oil may have promising health benefits, including managing anxiety and depression symptoms, decreasing pain levels, supporting sleep and enhancing overall well-being. One 2021 study examining real-world data from a cannabis clinic in Canada found CBD to be most effective among a patient population with moderate to severe symptoms.[2]CBD Study: Most Brands 50% Off Label Claims. NextEvo Naturals. Accessed 5/14/2025.
A CBD pharmaceutical called Epidiolex is approved by the FDA to treat certain severe seizure disorders as well.
Side Effects of CBD Oil
While consuming CBD oil has potential benefits, a few side effects may cause discomfort for CBD users.
“CBD is generally considered safe, but possible side effects include somnolence (drowsiness), fatigue, and diarrhea,” says Dr. Piomelli. “The most serious concern is the [potential] interaction with life-saving medications, the effectiveness of which could be altered by high doses of CBD.”
Other side effects can include nausea, irritability, agitation, liver injury and a negative impact on male reproductive health.
If you’re taking any prescription drugs, supplements or over-the-counter medications, consult with your health care provider before taking CBD oil to avoid the risk of potential drug interactions. The FDA also cautions against using CBD oil while pregnant or breastfeeding.

How Do You Take CBD Oil?
Experts advise newcomers to start with a low dose of CBD oil, such as 25 milligrams a day, and gradually increase their dose to a level that provides the desired effects. It’s best to navigate this process under the guidance of a qualified health care provider, as reactions to CBD can vary per person.
For CBD oil to take effect, it must first be digested in a process called first-pass digestion. Preliminary research suggests consuming CBD oil with high-fat foods may increase CBD’s bioavailability, but further human trials are needed. CBD tinctures are taken under the tongue and are absorbed by the mucous membranes, which may mean they take effect more quickly, though more scientific evidence is necessary to support this theory.
How to Read CBD Labels
CBD products are not currently regulated by the FDA as dietary supplements, so it’s difficult to determine a product’s safety and efficacy. However, knowing how to read a label can help ensure consumers understand the ingredients and potential benefits or risks of using a certain CBD product.
Statement of identity: This information indicates a product’s intended use. When shopping for CBD products, check the label to ensure you’re buying the specific form you’re looking for, such as cream, edible or tincture.
Composition: The content of a CBD product should indicate amounts of CBD per serving and CBD type (broad spectrum, full spectrum or isolate).
Health-related claims: These claims may also indicate to a consumer the intended use of a CBD product and its possible effects. Consider whether a CBD product claims to offer specific benefits, such as promoting sleep, pain relief or reducing anxiety.
Nutritional content: This information may be useful for individuals with health or dietary concerns, as some CBD labels may display certain nutritional claims. For example, some product labels may indicate that a product is low-calorie or gluten-free. This information should also include additional ingredients such as carrier oils and natural or artificial flavorings.
Third-party testing: All CBD products should be third-party laboratory tested to verify that the product contains no more than 0.3% THC by dry weight. If a product has been third-party tested, it should come with a certificate of analysis (COA) that confirms the amount of CBD the product contains and discloses whether the product contains additional cannabinoids, such as THC, as well as levels of contaminants like heavy metals, pesticides or biological impurities.
Choosing the Best CBD Oil Strength
There’s no standard dose or potency when it comes to taking CBD oil. Effects vary from person to person and depend on the type of CBD used, as well as other factors, such as height, weight and metabolic function. Furthermore, the effective dose of CBD oil may change based on the intended use—for example, whether it’s being used to support sleep, improve pain levels or reduce anxiety. More research is needed to determine standard effective doses and potencies of CBD oil.
“CBD oil is used—without much supportive evidence—for the self-medication of various conditions, including pain and anxiety,” says Dr. Piomelli. “If someone decides to try it, I would recommend to start with a low daily dose (50 milligrams maximum) and make sure to monitor themselves for side effects like somnolence (drowsiness), fatigue and diarrhea. I wouldn’t exceed a daily dose of 250 milligrams, nor would I take it for more than two to three weeks.”
How Much CBD Oil Should I Take?
The amount of CBD oil an individual should take varies based on the potency of the oil, the type of CBD it uses and desired effects. What’s more, CBD oil effects and absorption rates depend on additional factors, such as a person’s body weight, height and individual metabolism.
Experts generally recommend starting with a low dose and potency and building from there to find the ideal CBD oil dose for you.
How Long Does CBD Oil Take to Work?
Some research suggests holding CBD oil underneath the tongue may lead to absorption through the bloodstream, meaning the effects may be felt sooner than other delivery methods, but additional studies are needed to support these claims.
Meanwhile, CBD oil that is swallowed may take as long as 30 minutes to four hours to take effect, according to Dr. Piomelli. Additionally, research indicates that CBD bioavailability increases when consumed with a high-fat or high-calorie meal rather than consuming CBD alone or on an empty stomach.
“A full stomach speeds up absorption, but it could still take hours for CBD to be fully absorbed,” adds Dr. Piomelli.

Purchasing CBD oil online may come with certain benefits, such as the ability to request a digital COA for a specific product and read online reviews. Our Best CBD Oil of 2025 list exclusively includes products that have been third-party tested for quality and potency and may be a great place to start your search for the perfect CBD oil.
Who should use CBD oil?
A growing body of research suggests CBD oil may benefit people with:
Anxiety
Depression
PTSD
Epilepsy syndromes
Opioid addiction
Neurodegenerative disorders and diseases
Unmanageable chronic pain
Diabetic complications
Arthritis
Talk to your health care provider to learn more about whether CBD oil could be beneficial for you.
Is CBD oil safe?
The FDA reports it’s only seen limited data regarding the safety of CBD. Anyone interested in consuming CBD in any form should first consult with their health care provider and be aware of potential risks associated with using CBD products, including liver injury, drug interactions and male reproductive toxicity.
Is CBD oil legal?
As of 2021, CBD that comes from hemp (a type of cannabis sativa plant) that produces no more than 0.3% THC by dry weight is considered legal at the federal level. State laws vary, so it’s best to confirm any rules and regulations that apply to your area with your local and state legislation.
How much THC is in CBD Oil?
The amount of THC in CBD oil varies depending on the type of CBD used: CBD isolate, broad-spectrum CBD or full-spectrum CBD. Of the three, full-spectrum CBD oil is likely to contain the highest amount of THC, but its contents should remain under the federal limit of .3% by dry weight. CBD isolate contains strictly CBD while broad-spectrum CBD contains additional cannabinoids found in the hemp plant but not THC.
Can CBD oil impact the results of a drug test?
Standard drug tests don’t screen for CBD because it’s not an intoxicating substance, nor is it an illegal controlled substance. However, some CBD products contain trace amounts of THC, which can affect the results of a drug test.
Can CBD oil be applied topically to help with pain?
While research is limited regarding the effects of CBD topicals on pain, some small studies indicate that topical CBD creams, lotions and balms may reduce pain for individuals with arthritis and nerve damage. Additionally, CBD topicals may improve skin conditions including acne, rosacea and eczema, though further studies are needed to confirm these effects.
