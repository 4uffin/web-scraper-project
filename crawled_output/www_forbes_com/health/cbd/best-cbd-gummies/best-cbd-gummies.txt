Why We Picked ItWith a wide array of unique flavors and two potencies available (10 milligrams of CBD per serving and 25 milligrams of CBD per serving), these CBD isolate gummies may be a notable option for consumers who want to ensure they’re taking pure CBD without any additional cannabinoids, including THC. However, the manufacturer dosing instructions are vague on the product website, suggesting users should take a single gummy as needed. Inexperienced CBD users may need additional guidance regarding an appropriate dosage for their needs.

Third-Party Laboratory Testing Methodology: How We Tested
Image Credit: Nova Analytic Labs/ Kaylin Keith
Forbes Health facilitated independent, third-party laboratory testing for the top CBD gummies in our rankings through Nova Analytic Labs in Portland, Maine. The laboratory was selected to evaluate CBD oil potency and quality due to its strict standards and commitment to consumer safety.
Lab technicians evaluated the following elements of each top-ranking CBD gummy:
CBD potency
THC potency
Potencies of minor cannabinoid types
Presence or absence and types of terpenes
Detection of pesticides, mycotoxins, microbials and heavy metals
Homogeneity (ensuring CBD potencies match from gummy to gummy within a package)
Nova Analytic Labs generated COAs for each CBD gummy based on these testing results, detailing specific cannabinoid and terpene potencies, as well as any indication of potentially harmful contaminants. Samples with non-detectable (or lower than measurable) levels of mycotoxins, microbes and heavy metals received a “pass.” The Forbes Health editorial team carefully examined each laboratory-provided COA, comparing them to the COAs originally published by each CBD brand and evaluating factors of potential disqualification, including:
THC levels surpassing the federally allowed amount of 0.3% by dry weight
Any presence of pesticides, mycotoxins, microbes or heavy metals above the safety threshold adhered to by the third-party laboratory based on state guidelines
What Are CBD Gummies?
Retail CBD products come in a variety of forms, and CBD gummies are among the most popular. These chewy edibles are infused with specific amounts of CBD and provide similar benefits as CBD oil and tincture products, potentially offering effects like improved sleep, increased relaxation, reduced anxiety and pain relief, among others. CBD gummies may be appealing to consumers who dislike the taste of hemp.
“The main reason for choosing a gummy over a tincture would likely be a matter of taste,” says Gerry McNally, Ph.D., vice president of research and development at NextEvo Naturals, a CBD and supplement company, and Forbes Health Advisory Board member. “Other reasons could be that a gummy contains a premeasured dose [of CBD] versus having to measure out a number of drops of oil tincture.”
CBD gummy products are made with one of three types of CBD:
Full spectrum, which contains all the cannabinoids and terpenes that occur naturally in the hemp plant, including less than 0.3% THC (to comply with federal regulations).
Broad spectrum, which contains all the cannabinoids and terpenes that grow in the hemp plant, minus THC. Most broad-spectrum CBD products are advertised as containing zero THC, though trace amounts of THC can remain.
CBD isolate, which is pure CBD (it contains no other cannabinoids or terpenes, including THC).
In addition to hemp-derived CBD, gummies often contain a longer ingredient list compared to other forms of CBD, such as oils.
“I often remind patients that while CBD gummies are popular for their [potential] wellness benefits, they often mimic candy in their formulation,” says Bridget Cole Williams, M.D., a family medicine practitioner specializing in integrating traditional medicine with holistic methods, as well as a Forbes Health Advisory Board member. “This means they can contain ingredients like artificial sweeteners, synthetic dyes, excessive sugars, synthetic preservatives and fillers—substances that may not align with health-conscious goals,” she adds, noting individuals who are sensitive to these ingredients should pay close attention to a CBD gummy product’s ingredient list. “Choosing products with transparent labeling and minimal, high-quality ingredients is a safer approach,” advises Dr. Williams.
CBD gummies, like other types of retail CBD products, are unregulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), meaning there’s no designated formulation, manufacturing process or recommended dose of CBD per gummy.

CBD Gummies Dosage
There is no recommended CBD dosage for retail CBD products, including gummies. The FDA has only approved one prescription drug containing CBD, Epidiolex, which is used to treat rare forms of epilepsy.
Most CBD gummies contain between 10 milligrams of CBD per serving and 50 milligrams of CBD per serving (or higher), and manufacturer recommendations vary greatly from product to product.
Starting “slow and low” is important when it comes to CBD dosing, says Dr. Williams. “For those new to CBD, it’s wise to start with a low dose to gauge how your body reacts,” she adds. For retail CBD gummies, Dr. Williams considers a low dose of CBD to be 5 to 10 milligrams per serving, a moderate dose to be 10 to 25 milligrams of CBD per serving and a high dose to be 25 milligrams to 50 milligrams of CBD per serving.
As edibles, CBD gummies must go through the body’s digestive system and the liver in a process called first-pass metabolism before any CBD is absorbed into the body, which research suggests can lead to low bioavailability and delayed onset of effects. In fact, a 2023 article in the International Journal of Molecular Sciences suggests that just 9% to 13% of CBD taken orally, such as CBD gummies, is absorbed by the body.[2]Hossain KR, Alghalayini A, Valenzuela SM. Current Challenges and Opportunities for Improved Cannabidiol Solubility. Int J Mol Sci. 2023;24(19):14514.
“Because some CBD is lost during digestion, those [individuals] with moderate to severe symptoms may need to take a higher dose than initially anticipated,” says Dr. Williams. “If you’re using gummies for conditions like anxiety or chronic pain relief, you might require a dose of 30 milligrams to 50 milligrams to compensate for the reduced absorption rate.”
To assist with increased bioavailability, Dr. McNally recommends looking for a product that contains a water-soluble (or emulsion) form of CBD rather than a CBD oil. These details can be found on product packaging.
Always speak to a clinician familiar with CBD before adding CBD gummies to your health regimen, as the appropriate dose is highly individualized and based on specific needs.
How Do CBD Gummies Work?
Research into how CBD gummies and CBD in general work in the body is ongoing. The only CBD product that’s undergone rigorous clinical testing is the FDA-approved drug, Epidiolex.
However, studies suggest that certain CBD benefits are due to the cannabinoid’s interaction with the endocannabinoid system (ECS). The ECS may contribute to certain functions of the body’s central and peripheral nervous systems, including mood, behavior, seizure activity, male and female reproductive activity and digestion, among others.
The ECS features CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptors. Experts believe CBD and other cannabinoids and terpenes interact with these receptors to produce certain effects, such as reducing inflammation in the body, though additional research is necessary.
Many experts and retailers suggest full-spectrum and broad-spectrum CBD, which contain several naturally occurring cannabinoids and terpenes, may have an enhanced effect within the body through the synergistic entourage effect (when multiple cannabinoids interact with the ECS at once). However, a recent review in Pharmaceuticals concludes little conclusive research exists to support proof of the entourage effect, and further studies are necessary.[3]André, R, Gomes, AP, Pereira-Leite, C, Marques-da-Costa, A, et al. The Entourage Effect in Cannabis Medicinal Products: A Comprehensive Review. Pharmaceuticals. 2024;(17)1543.
Health Benefits of CBD Gummies
Research is limited when it comes to confirming the potential health benefits of CBD. However, some preliminary studies suggest CBD may provide relief for a number of health and wellness concerns, including improving sleep, managing pain, alleviating anxiety, treating symptoms of epilepsy and more.
Research into the benefits of CBD gummies is ongoing. Dr. McNally notes that CBD may have “some positive benefits in oral care, such as reducing oral infections and gingivitis.” These details are supported by a 2025 meta-analysis in Applied Sciences. Further clinical trials are necessary to confirm all of the above-listed benefits, however.
Side Effects of CBD Gummies
CBD gummies may pose the same health risks and side effects as other CBD products. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), these include:
Drug-to-drug interactions (may hinder or alter how the liver breaks down certain prescribed medications)
Drowsiness or sedation
Cognitive impairment
Liver injury
Digestive upset
Irritability
Using CBD while pregnant or breastfeeding is not recommended due to a lack of research.
Dr. McNally notes, however, that products containing any level of THC have “more noticeable side effects” than THC-free alternatives due to the psychoactive elements found in THC.
“Many of the reported side effects for CBD product[s] have been thought to arise from levels of THC contained in hemp products either labeled as full-spectrum hemp extract or having unlabeled THC present in the product,” Dr. McNally says. “This underscores the need to be sure the product is accurately labeled and has a COA, which shows the cannabinoid content.”
Furthermore, CBD gummies may pose a higher risk of accidentally being consumed by children as they’re designed to look and taste like candies, so it’s important to store CBD edibles safely and out of reach.
How to Choose the Best CBD Gummies for You
“It’s difficult for consumers to know which [CBD] products are good,” cautions Dr. McNally. “The only advice I can offer is to choose a brand that has a good reputation and positive reviews, ideally by independent sources.” Dr. McNally also notes that a reputable company should make COAs easily accessible, as well as offer clinical data to support its gummy product’s efficacy.
Dr. Williams agrees. “When it comes to choosing CBD gummies, quality and trustworthiness are essential but not always easy to discern,” she says.
According to Dr. Williams, CBD consumers should consider the following factors when judging the quality of a CBD gummy product:
Look for third-party laboratory testing, with easily accessible COAs.
Purchase products made with U.S.-grown hemp, which must comply with strict agricultural regulations.
Look for organic and non-GMO products to minimize potential exposure to harmful chemicals, including pesticides.
Read the ingredient list carefully, and avoid products containing artificial sweeteners, synthetic preservatives or excessive sugar. Instead, choose products with natural flavors, plant-based colorants and healthy sweeteners like organic cane sugar or fruit juice.
Be aware of unrealistic health claims made by a company or brand, such as alleging its CBD gummies can cure a disease or offer guaranteed results. “Legitimate brands stick to scientifically backed [potential] benefits and comply with FDA guidelines in their marketing,” adds Dr. WIlliams.
Consider lifestyle factors, such as veganism, as some gummies contain animal-derived gelatin.
Dr. McNally also advises consumers to consider the look of CBD gummies in their packaging. Aesthetic qualities, such as the appearance of a gummy can be helpful in determining the quality of a product. Other factors to be aware of include making sure gummies don’t stick together in their packaging, have good taste and include an expiration date, he says.
The FDA publishes warning letters they’ve sent to CBD companies for any reason, including making false marketing claims, online. For added security, CBD consumers can conduct their own research when they’re trying to choose a brand or product.

Final Thoughts
“Ultimately, when it comes to CBD gummies, simpler is better,” says Dr. Williams. “By avoiding overly processed ingredients and selecting thoughtfully crafted products, you can ensure your CBD aligns with your wellness goals. Just as you prioritize quality in your health care decisions, it’s essential to do the same for the products you trust for your health.”

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
What do CBD gummies do?
CBD gummies offer similar benefits to CBD tinctures and oils, allowing users to experience the effects of CBD, such as helping ease symptoms like anxiety and pain, and improving sleep and feelings of relaxation. CBD gummies also offer less of a hemp flavor, which may be appealing to people who prefer to avoid the taste of CBD commonly found in tincture and oil form.
Are CBD gummies safe?
While CBD is believed to have a fairly high safety profile for many people, all products containing it, as well as those with THC, should be taken with care. The CDC notes that taking CBD is “not risk-free,” as research into CBD’s potential use cases continues. Consult a health care professional before trying any CBD gummies or associated products.
Do CBD gummies make you feel anything?
Much like other CBD products, CBD gummies help users experience the benefits of CBD, which can include improved sleep and increased relaxation, as well as less anxiety and pain. However, the degree of which a person will feel these effects pertains directly to the dose and potency of CBD gummy they choose to take, as well as their personal CBD tolerance.
Certain CBD gummies, such as full-spectrum gummies, offer users all the cannabinoids and terpenes in the hemp plant, meaning the gummy likely has a higher potency and may include trace amounts of THC. CBD isolate or broad-spectrum gummies likely have lower potencies, as these types of CBD products typically remove all THC from the CBD, though broad-spectrum gummies may carry trace amounts.
Is CBD considered a drug?
CBD is considered a prescription drug but is not federally legal to use in foods or dietary supplements. CBD was made legal in 2018 thanks to the Agriculture Improvement Act, commonly referred to as the Farm Bill, which made it legal to sell CBD made from hemp and not exceeding 0.03% THC by dry weight in the U.S. Though the law removed CBD from the federal Controlled Substances Act, laws pertaining to CBD differ across states, as some states have not removed hemp from their controlled-substances lists.
Do CBD gummies contain THC?
While many CBD gummies contain THC, there are also some that do not. This ranking includes THC and THC-free options for consumption. Consult our lab testing results on this page to see the THC dosage for each featured product.
Can CBD gummies impact the results of a drug test?
CBD on its own will not alter the results of a drug test. However, if a CBD product also contains THC, the THC could alter the results. This subject becomes especially complex given that it’s possible a CBD product may contain THC even though a manufacturer claims it does not. Always use products with ingredients verified by third-party laboratories, like the ones in this ranking, to ensure your CBD gummy doesn’t contain THC.
What happens when you take CBD for the first time?
A person’s reaction to CBD upon their first use differs based on their overall tolerance and body chemistry. While some people may feel more relaxed, sleepy, or a reduction in pain and anxiety, others may need more CBD before these effects are realized. It’s also important to note that CBD builds in the body over each use, meaning it may take several uses before the desired effects reach their full potential, or a level at which a person notices the benefits they’re seeking. Speak to a holistic health care practitioner to determine the proper CBD dosage for your needs and how long you should take CBD before expecting to feel its full effects in your body.
