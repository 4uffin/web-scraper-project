If you’re an athlete, or have found yourself focused on building muscle, it’s very possible you’ve heard about creatine, which is a natural compound synthesized from the amino acids glycine, arginine and methionine, and which is also available in supplement form.
Claims about creatine’s ability to increase athletic performance abound, but do these claims really hold up when it comes to scientific research? Read on to learn more about the benefits of this supplement, if it’s essential for athletes, and a few brands that may be worth it—as recommended by Forbes Health Advisory Board nutrition experts.

What is Creatine?
Amino acids are molecules in the body that combine to form proteins. As an amino acid derivative, creatine plays a big part in creating energy for our cells, especially in times of increased energy demand, such as sleep deprivation, certain mental health conditions or neurological diseases.
Specifically, creatine helps create the compound adenosine triphosphate (ATP). “ATP is the body’s source of energy, and when [it is] depleted in the muscles, fatigue starts to occur,” says Destini Moody, a registered sports dietitian at Garage Gym Reviews and head of performance nutrition for the NBA G League Ignite team. When creatine is added to the muscles [in the form of food or creatine supplements] it can help regenerate ATP faster, which can boost exercise performance, notes Moody.
The human body produces creatine on its own, and additional amounts can be ingested via meat, seafood, milk and eggs, as well as from supplements. The majority of creatine, about 95%, is found in skeletal muscles, which is why creatine is largely associated with muscle gain and exercise. The remaining 5% of creatine in the body can be found in the brain and testes (in those with male reproductive organs)[1]Kreider RB, Kalman DS, Antonio J, et al. International Society of Sports Nutrition position stand: safety and efficacy of creatine supplementation in exercise, sport, and medicine. J Int Soc Sports Nutr. 2017;14:18. .
The Best Creatine Supplements, Recommended By Nutrition Experts
When it comes to finding the right creatine supplement for you, there are many options out there. We spoke to a few nutrition experts and Forbes Health Advisory Board members to get their top recommendations to help make your decision making a little easier.
Thorne Creatine MonohydratePrice: $40 for 90 servingsCreatine per serving: 5 grams	Shop Now	On Amazon Why We Picked It“Thorne’s Creatine Monohydrate is a micronized form of creatine, which makes it more soluble in water and allows it to mix easily and dissolve completely (which can reduce stomach upset for many),” notes Melina Jampolis, M.D., an internist, board-certified physician nutrition specialist and Forbes Health Advisory Board member. According to Dr. Jampolis, this brand of creatine is also used by the U.S. Olympic teams, pro athletes and the Mayo Clinic.In addition to noting that Thorne’s Creatine Monohydrate is NSF Certified for Sport (which is why it’s so widely used by professional athletes), Toby Amidor, registered dietitian, author and Forbes Health Advisory Board member notes that this particular creatine is also gluten free.
Klean Athlete Klean CreatinePrice: $31.60 for 60 servingsCreatine per serving: 5 grams	Shop Now	On Amazon Why We Picked It“Douglas Labs’ Klean Athlete line is one of the leading clinical providers of dietary supplements known for their safety, efficacy and use of third-party testing,” notes Dr. Jampolis, who also recommends Klean Creatine due to its pure creatine monohydrate formulation and the fact that it’s free from gluten and GMOs.This particular creatine is also free of wheat, artificial coloring, flavoring and sweeteners, notes Amidor, and is vegan friendly and NSF Certified for Sport.
What Are The Health Benefits of Creatine?
Creatine may have several benefits, but it’s important to note that most studies regarding creatine’s efficacy and safety pertain to a specific type called creatine monohydrate. Supplements that contain other forms of creatine and/or other ingredients may not offer the same exact benefits.
Improved muscle recovery. Creatine supplementation can decrease recovery time between workouts by lessening some muscle damage and promoting muscle fiber recovery[2]Wax B, Kerksick CM, Jagim AR, Mayo JJ, Lyons BC, Kreider RB. Creatine for Exercise and Sports Performance, with Recovery Considerations for Healthy Populations. Nutrients. 2021;13(6):1915. .
Creatine use can also help reduce muscle soreness, which can enable more frequent exercising without the barrier of soreness, says Moody.
Increased power and endurance. Studies have largely analyzed creatine’s performance-improving benefits in fitness and weight training, running and swimming; in these studies, participants generally saw a 10% to 20% improvement in their athletic performance. While most studies have been performed in men, creatine has also shown benefits in women and children[1]Kreider RB, Kalman DS, Antonio J, et al. International Society of Sports Nutrition position stand: safety and efficacy of creatine supplementation in exercise, sport, and medicine. J Int Soc Sports Nutr. 2017;14:18. .
Increased muscle size and strength. Several studies show creatine supplementation increases the availability of creatine for muscles, contributing to greater strength and muscle mass, as well as performance. However, some studies indicate that women may not see as much gain from supplementation as men[2]Wax B, Kerksick CM, Jagim AR, Mayo JJ, Lyons BC, Kreider RB. Creatine for Exercise and Sports Performance, with Recovery Considerations for Healthy Populations. Nutrients. 2021;13(6):1915. .
Postmenopausal muscle strength. At least one study maintains that high doses of creatine, about 0.3 grams per kilogram of body weight per day, may increase muscle size and function in postmenopausal individuals[4]Forbes SC, Cordingley DM, Cornish SM, et al. Effects of Creatine Supplementation on Brain Function and Health. Nutrients. 2022;14(5):921. .
Neuroprotective properties. Study results are mixed, but there is some evidence to suggest that creatine supplementation may be beneficial for cognitive functioning, especially in memory[5]Antonio J, Candow DG, Forbes SC, et al. Common questions and misconceptions about creatine supplementation: what does the scientific evidence really show?. J Int Soc Sports Nutr. 2021;18(1):13. .
Further, studies show some evidence of improved exercise capacity in people with neuromuscular disease, such as muscular dystrophy, Huntington’s disease, Parkinson disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)[2]Wax B, Kerksick CM, Jagim AR, Mayo JJ, Lyons BC, Kreider RB. Creatine for Exercise and Sports Performance, with Recovery Considerations for Healthy Populations. Nutrients. 2021;13(6):1915. .

Potential Side Effects of Creatine
“Side effects of creatine [supplementation] are generally mild and go away over time,” says Jesse Feder, a registered dietitian, personal trainer and contributor to My Crohn’s and Colitis Team, a social network for individuals living with those conditions.
Side effects of creatine supplementation, per Feder and Alex Larson, a Minnesota-based registered dietitian and athlete nutrition coach at Alex Larson Nutrition, can include:
Bloating
Gas
Stomach cramps
Water retention during first days of supplementation
Nausea and diarrhea (when consuming too much creatine at one time)
Are Creatine Supplements Safe?
Research by the International Society of Sports Nutrition indicates that creatine supplementation is generally safe and well-tolerated in adults for both short and long-term use[1]Kreider RB, Kalman DS, Antonio J, et al. International Society of Sports Nutrition position stand: safety and efficacy of creatine supplementation in exercise, sport, and medicine. J Int Soc Sports Nutr. 2017;14:18. . However, more research is needed to determine whether creatine use is safe for children and teenagers.
When taken in very high doses, creatine supplements may cause kidney damage or cause the body to stop producing creatine naturally. Consult with your doctor to determine if you would benefit from taking a creatine supplement.
Types of Creatine Supplements
Creatine supplements may contain different forms of creatine, each with different purported benefits. While creatine monohydrate is the most widely used and most researched form, various supplements may use creatine in other forms, like ethyl ester, hydrochloride and more.
Creatine Monohydrate
Creatine monohydrate is the most commonly used form of creatine in dietary supplements. Research indicates that taking creatine monohydrate supplements during athletic training or exercise may promote muscle gain as well as increased strength and exercise capacity[5]Antonio J, Candow DG, Forbes SC, et al. Common questions and misconceptions about creatine supplementation: what does the scientific evidence really show?. J Int Soc Sports Nutr. 2021;18(1):13. .
Creatine Ethyl Ester
Creatine ethyl ester is a synthetic form of creatine thought to improve the supplement’s absorption in the stomach. While some research supports that creatine ethyl ester may be better absorbed in the body compared to other creatine forms, other studies indicate that ethyl ester creatine is not as effective in increasing muscle creatine levels as creatine monohydrate[6]Gufford BT, Ezell EL, Robinson DH, et al. pH-dependent stability of creatine ethyl ester: relevance to oral absorption. J Diet Suppl. 2013;10(3):241-251. [7]Spillane M, Schoch R, Cooke M, et al. The effects of creatine ethyl ester supplementation combined with heavy resistance training on body composition, muscle performance, and serum and muscle creatine levels. J Int Soc Sports Nutr. 2009;6:6. .
Creatine Hydrochloride
Some manufacturers claim that creatine hydrochloride has a higher body absorption rate and requires a lower dose to experience positive effects of the supplement compared to other forms of creatine. In fact, one study found that creatine in hydrochloride form was significantly more water-soluble than creatine monohydrate[8]Gufford BT, Sriraghavan K, Miller NJ, et al. Physicochemical characterization of creatine N-methylguanidinium salts. J Diet Suppl. 2010;7(3):240-252. .
However, another small study examining the effects of creatine hydrochloride and creatine monohydrate on 36 participants found that creatine hydrochloride consumption did not produce greater athletic performance or hormonal changes than in those who took creatine in monohydrate form[9]M Tayebi, H Arazi. Is creatine hydrochloride better than creatine monohydrate for the improvement of physical performance and hormonal changes in young trained men?. Science & Sports. 2020;35(5):135-141. .
Creatine Magnesium Chelate
Some research indicates that creatine magnesium chelate supplements may increase water stores in the body, which may improve muscular creatine and strength. However, one specific, older study from 2004 examining bench press endurance and strength of individuals taking creatine magnesium chelate or creatine monohydrate supplements found that both supplements improved body strength, but that neither supplement outperformed the other[10]Selsby JT, DiSilvestro RA, Devor ST. Mg2+-creatine chelate and a low-dose creatine supplementation regimen improve exercise performance. J Strength Cond Res. 2004;18(2):311-315. .

How Much Does Creatine Cost?
Creatine supplements may cost anywhere from $10 to $99 depending on factors like the manufacturer, servings per container and the form of creatine contained in the supplement.
Who Should Take Creatine Supplements?
Creatine supplements are usually best for athletes and individuals who regularly exercise to increase muscle mass and want to optimize their exercise recovery.
“Research has also found small, notable benefits to athletes’ sprinting performance,” Larson adds.
Moody and some researchers note that women may specifically benefit from creatine supplementation, as they tend to report consuming significantly smaller amounts of creatine from their diet than men, and have 70–80% lower endogenous creatine stores[3]Smith-Ryan AE, Cabre HE, Eckerson JM, Candow DG. Creatine Supplementation in Women's Health: A Lifespan Perspective. Nutrients. 2021;13(3):877. .
“It is important to drink your recommended daily intake of water when supplementing with creatine,” notes Jenna Stangland, a sports dietitian with supplement brand Momentous, director of nutrition with the Minnesota Timberwolves NBA organization and team dietitian for the Minnesota Wild NHL organization. Water is integral in getting creatine to your muscles—where the creatine is then stored—and in the process of creating energy from creatine. “Making sure you are drinking water helps the intracellular process of how creatine is used to make energy,” says Stangland.
Who Should Avoid Taking Creatine Supplements?
Individuals with kidney, liver or heart disease and/or high blood pressure should avoid creatine supplementation, say Larson and Moody, as this can worsen such existing conditions.
For otherwise healthy individuals, when taken as advised (such as via the directions on your supplement or a recommendation from a registered dietitian), there should be no adverse effects from creatine. However, excessive amounts may cause bodily harm, as evidenced by one case involving an athlete who took more than 10 grams of creatine daily for 6 weeks and experienced rhabdomyolysis (breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue) and sudden kidney failure.
How to Take Creatine Supplements
Creatine supplements typically come in powdered form that dissolve in water. Other supplement forms like liquids, capsules or tablets and drink mixes are also widely available. Always take creatine supplements as directed by the product label.
How Much Creatine Should You Take?
How much creatine you should take per day depends on factors like your personal health history and fitness goals. For those who opt for creatine loading, a typical dose may be 5 grams of creatine monohydrate four times per day for two to five days. For those who use creatine supplements for maintenance in exercise performance, you’ll typically only need to take 2 grams of creatine per day.
Consult with your doctor to determine how much creatine you should take per day.
When Is the Best Time to Take Creatine?
There is no best time of day to take creatine. You just need to take it either right before or right after your workout, whether that’s in the morning, afternoon or night, according to Feder and Larson. If creatine causes stomach issues, Larson recommends taking it with a meal.
Do I Need to Load Creatine?
Creatine loading refers to the practice of taking small doses of creatine (usually 5 grams) four to five times per day for five to seven days. While creatine loading may increase muscular stores of creatine, research suggests that taking smaller doses of creatine (3 to 5 grams per day) may also lead to increased muscular creatine stores and improve muscle mass, athletic performance and recovery[6]Gufford BT, Ezell EL, Robinson DH, et al. pH-dependent stability of creatine ethyl ester: relevance to oral absorption. J Diet Suppl. 2013;10(3):241-251. .
Is Creatine Worth Using?
Creatine is mostly worth using if you are looking to increase your strength and power in your exercises and train regularly, according to Feder, Larson and Moody.
What Happens If You Stop Taking Creatine?
Generally, when you stop taking creatine supplements, the creatine levels in your body will restore to pre-supplementation levels.
