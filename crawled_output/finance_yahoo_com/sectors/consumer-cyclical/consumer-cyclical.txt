Also, key inflation data is due on Friday. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note is 4.14%. Crude oil is at $62 per barrel. Argus• 6 hours ago

Daily Spotlight: Will Builders Sizzle or Fizzle?
Shares of homebuilders have raised the roof, rising 14% over the last six months despite strained housing affordability and a sluggish economy. Will the shares continue to sizzle, or fizzle as they did last autumn? We focus on interest rates, inventories, incentives, and inflation. Builder sentiment has been flat for the last five months, according to the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB), and building permits are down 11% over the last year. But there was a catalyst in the September NAHB housing market index. Though buyer traffic and present conditions are stuck, sales expectations for the next six months rose to their highest level since March as mortgage rates declined by about a quarter point in the weeks before the survey and builders expected the Fed's interest-rate cut. With 30-year mortgage rates of 6.25%, down from 6.9% in June, there are anecdotal reports of increasing buyer interest. We look for broad confirmation from NAHB traffic next month. With the inventory of new homes elevated (at 9.2 months at the current pace of sales), we expect permits and housing starts to remain low until builders can trim the overhang of unsold homes and reduce the need for incentives (which are weighing on profit margins). Any progress builders make may be sustainable only if mortgage rates continue to decline in a still-healthy economy. Reductions in the fed funds rate should lower the cost of builder and developer loans, but long-term rates may fall further only if inflation does. With soft job growth and slightly restrictive monetary policy, we expect inflation expectations to ease as long as cost pressures from tariffs remain muted and peak in early 2026. This Wednesday, we expect the Census Bureau to report that August new home sales declined about 7.7% from a year earlier to 640,000 SAAR. On September 30, we expect the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index will post an annual increase of 1.5% for July, a continuing deceleration from the 1.9% increase in June. The Zillow Home Value Index rose by an annual 0.3% in July. Argus• 13 hours ago
