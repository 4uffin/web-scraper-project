Analyst Report: Darden Restaurants, Inc.
Darden Restaurants is the largest restaurant operator in the US full-service space, with consolidated revenue of $12.1 billion in fiscal 2025. The company maintains a portfolio of 11 restaurant brands: Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse, Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen, Ruth's Chris, Yard House, The Capital Grille, Seasons 52, Eddie V’s, Bahama Breeze, The Capital Burger, and most recently, Chuy's. Darden generates revenue almost exclusively from company-owned restaurants, though a small network of franchised restaurants and consumer-packaged goods sales contribute modestly through the traditional grocery channel. As of the end of its fiscal 2025, the company operated 2,159 restaurants in the US.

Analyst Report: THOR Industries, Inc.
Based in Elkhart, Indiana, Thor Industries manufactures Class A, Class B, and Class C motor homes along with travel trailers and fifth-wheel towables across about 35 brands. Through the acquisition of Erwin Hymer in 2019, the company expanded its geographic footprint and now produces various motorized and towable recreational vehicles for Europe, including motor caravans, camper vans, urban vehicles, caravans, and other RV-related products and services. The company has also begun generating revenue through aftermarket component parts via the acquisition of Airxcel in 2021; however, this is still a nascent part of the business as it accounts for less than 10% of total sales. In fiscal 2024, the company wholesaled 186,908 units and generated over $10 billion in revenue.

Daily Spotlight: Benefits of Small- and Mid-Caps
Despite bursts of outperformance, small- and mid-cap stocks (SMID) have underperformed large-caps year to date -- as they have over the past five years. But they may be in a better position to generate market-beating returns going forward. For one thing, SMID companies tend to focus on domestic markets, so their businesses could be less disrupted by the trade and tariff debate or other geopolitical developments. For another, lower interest rates (as the Federal Reserve eases policy) could also reduce the cost of funding for capital-hungry smaller companies. As well, the prices of SMID stocks generally are lower than the prices of large-caps, with the P/E ratio on the Russell 2000 SmallCap Index at 20, compared to a trailing P/E above 26 for the S&P 500. Finally, there are long stretches in the record books when SMID stocks have outperformed large-caps. For example, from 2003-2021, the Russell 2000 climbed 450%, compared to an advance of 330% for the S&P 500. That said, SMID stocks can be risky. The standard deviation for monthly returns was 5.7% for SMID stocks over our 2003-2021 test period, versus 4.3% for large-caps. SMID stocks fell further in negative years during our test period, with an average 15% drop versus a 12% pullback for large-caps. Still, despite the risks, diversified investors look to have exposure to small- and mid-caps based on the long-term performance record. We estimate that 15% of the U.S. stock market's capitalization is comprised of SMID stocks. Argus• 13 hours ago
