Technical Assessment: Bullish in the Intermediate-Term
If you didn't get enough of Chairman Powell and all the closet economists last week, you will get your fill and then some this week. Fed presidents, governors, vice chairs, and even the Fed chairman are due to hit the airwaves. Maybe that's a good thing, because economic news is otherwise sparse (August PCE on Friday) and there only a few big earnings reports (AZO, MU, ACN, JBL, and COST).
Last week was another good period for the major indices, as stocks continue to move deeper into unchartered territory. The S&P 500 (SPX) rose 1.2%, the S&P 100 was up 1.6%, the Invesco S&P 500 Top 50 ETF (XLG) popped 1.7%, and the Nasdaq and Nasdaq 100 both tacked on 2.2%. Small-caps participated once again, rising 2.2% on the week. The SPX has gained ground in 16 of the past 24 weeks (since the April bottom). The advance has been very tight and, historically, that is bullish. Since jumping over the 21-day exponential average on April 24, price has closed below that line only one time.
Last week again featured risk, as the three highest-ranked sectors from a technical basis led, with Technology ripping higher by 3%, Communication Services gaining 1.8%, and Discretionary adding 1.2%. Industrials rose 1%, while Financial was up 0.8%. The six weakest sectors technically all fell, with Real Estate and Staples losing 1.2%, Materials off 0.8%, and Utilities and Healthcare dropping 0.6%.
The Commitment of Traders (CO)T data remains bullish for the S&P 500 and the Russell 2000 and slightly bearish for the Nasdaq 100 (which has improved over the past month). The data also remains bullish for the dollar and West Texas Intermediate, and bearish for Bitcoin. (Mark Arbeter, CMT) Argus• 12 hours ago
