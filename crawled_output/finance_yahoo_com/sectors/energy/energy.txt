Daily Spotlight: Oil Prices Likely to Trend Lower
The price of a barrel of the crude oil benchmark grade West Texas Intermediate has fluctuated between $56-$80 over the past year and is currently toward the bottom of that range. Oil prices are down almost 50% from the $115-$120 level touched in 1H22, when Russia invaded Ukraine. For 2025, we are anticipating an average price of $66, up slightly from current levels but lower compared to $77 in 2024, $80 in 2023 and $95 in 2022. Our forecast trading range for the balance of the year is $55-$70. The core long-term drivers behind oil prices come from Econ 101: supply and demand. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, there will be an excess supply of oil in 2025: global consumption is estimated at 103.7 million barrels per day, while global production is estimated at 105.4 million barrels. Forecasts for 2026 also call for supply to exceed demand. Our preliminary estimate for 2026 is $60. Of course, there are always wild cards, such as geopolitical developments that range from tariffs to regional turmoil and wars to sanctions and to the whims of OPEC. The growth path of the Chinese economy also plays an outsized role in the direction of oil prices, and growth in India may some day have a greater impact than it does today.
These wild cards can cause prices to fluctuate dramatically.
That said, absent wild cards, the global supply/demand outlook suggests the days of triple-digit oil prices are in the rear-view mirror as the world economy pivots toward cleaner energy solutions. Argus• 3 hours ago
