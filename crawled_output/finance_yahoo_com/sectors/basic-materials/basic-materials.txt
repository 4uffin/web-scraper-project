Market Digest: LVS, MDU, PFE, VMC, WEN, WYNN
As stocks continue to move higher (newly buoyed by interest rates that are officially on a downward trek), insiders continue to let off steam in what is arguably an increasingly toppy stock market. Still, with favorable seasonality in play through the end of 2025, it remains to be seem how much 'toppier' stocks can/will get.
The caution from insiders is in the higher end of the neutral range and, therefore, near the low end of the bearish range. On a scale where neutral sentiment runs from 2.00 to 6.00 and then bearish sentiment kicks in, the Total Eight-Week Sell/Buy Ratio from Vickers Stock Research (Vickers' broadest sell/buy measurement) is now 5.02. But it also has fallen into a very tight channel, as the ratio was 5.04 three weeks ago, 4.97 two weeks ago, and 4.90 last week. On a near-term basis and broken down by exchange, the highest degree of caution is coming from executives at companies that trade on the NYSE, as that exchange is currently posting a one-week ratio of 9.93. Relatively better is the one-week ratio for the Nasdaq, currently at 6.24. With the one-week readings running hotter than the eight-week results, a move into broad bearish sentiment is increasingly likely. End of day, insider sentiment is cautious and getting more cautious -- but not worthy of a 'run for the exits' response. This week, analysts at Vickers highlighted insider transactions of interest at Streamex Corp. (NCM: STEX) and Energy Vault Holdings Inc. (NYSE: NRGV). Argus• 3 hours ago

Analyst Report: Barrick Mining Corporation
Based in Toronto, Barrick Gold is one of the world's largest gold miners. In 2024, the firm produced nearly 3.9 million attributable ounces of gold and about 430 million pounds of copper. At year-end 2024, Barrick had about two decades of gold reserves along with significant copper reserves. After buying Randgold in 2019 and combining its Nevada mines in a joint venture with competitor Newmont later that year, it operates mines in 19 countries in the Americas, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. The company also has growing copper exposure. Its potential Reko Diq project in Pakistan, if developed, could double copper production by the end of the decade.
