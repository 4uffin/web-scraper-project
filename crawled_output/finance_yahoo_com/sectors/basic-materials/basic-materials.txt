Market Digest: BHP
Back to Inflation The Federal Reserve has started down an expansionary track, but will be keeping a watchful eye on inflation. On that score, fresh data is out this week (albeit backward looking) that should help those forecasting the overall trend. Meanwhile, Fed officials are out in force this week, with multiple public-speaking engagements (including Chairman Powell). Last week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about 1%, the S&P 500 gained 1.2%, and the Nasdaq was up 2.2%. So far this year, the Dow is up 8.8%, the S&P 500 13.3%, and the Nasdaq 17.2%.
On the economic calendar, new Fed Governor Stephen Miran speaks today at the Economic Club of New York, while Chairman Powell speaks on Tuesday at the Greater Providence Chamber of Commerce. In addition, data on New Home Sales is due out on Wednesday; the final read on GDP for the second quarter is out on Thursday; and the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index is out on Friday. Turning to other data, the Atlanta Fed GDPNow measure calls for GDP of 3.3% in the third quarter. That is higher than last week's forecast. The Cleveland Fed Inflation Nowcast forecasts a 3.0% rate for CPI in September, the same as last week. Mortgage rates fell nine basis points last week, with the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage now at 6.26%, according to FreddieMac. Gas prices fell two cents to an average of $3.17 per gallon for regular gas.
Looking ahead, the next Federal Reserve interest-rate decision comes on October 29. Odds are at 92% for another 25-basis-point rate cut, according to the CME FedWatch rate tool. After that, the last meeting of the year is on December 10, and odds are at 81% for a third 25-basis-point cut.
Taking a deeper dive into performance, U.S. stocks are lagging global stocks. A leading industrialized global stock market index, the ETF EFA, has surged 23% year to date, while the leading emerging market ETF EEM has gained 26%. U.S. growth stocks, with a year-to-date gain of 15% (ETF IWF) have taken the edge over value stocks (ETF IWD), which have booked an advance of 10%. In other asset classes for the year to date, AGG bonds are up 3%, gold is up 43%, crude oil is down 12%, and Bitcoin is up 24%. The U.S. dollar is down 10%, tracking DXY. The VIX Volatility Index is around 15, below its historical average of 20. Looking at leading and lagging sectors so far in 2025, Communication Services is the top performer with a 24% gain, followed by Industrials (+15%) and then Information Technology (+17%), all outperforming the S&P 500. Financials (+11%) and Materials (+10%) are just below the index. Defensive sectors like Energy, (+3%), Consumer Staples (+4%), Real Estate (+4%), Consumer Discretionary (+4%), and Healthcare (flat) make up the bottom of the list. Argus• 13 hours ago

Analyst Report: Newmont Corporation
Newmont is the world's largest gold miner. It bought Goldcorp in 2019, combined its Nevada mines in a joint venture with competitor Barrick later that year, and also purchased competitor Newcrest in November 2023. Its portfolio includes 17 wholly or majority owned mines and interests in two joint ventures in the Americas, Africa, Australia and Papua New Guinea. The company is expected to sell roughly 5.6 million ounces of gold in 2025 from its core mines after selling six higher-cost, smaller mines. Newmont also produces material amounts of copper, silver, zinc, and lead as byproducts. It had about two decades of gold reserves along with significant byproduct reserves at the end of December 2024.
