Daily Spotlight: Fed's Favorite Inflation Indicator
The Fed's favorite inflation indicator, the PCE Price Index, will be released on Friday. The index differs from the better-known Consumer Price Index (CPI) because its composition is changed more frequently and it is thus quicker to reflect real-time pricing fluctuations.
In the most-recent report, PCE inflation reportedly increased at a 2.6% rate year over year through July. By comparison, the latest CPI report, through July, had overall inflation rising 2.9%. Core PCE, which removes volatile food and energy prices, had risen at an annual rate of 2.9% in the latest month. Our PCE forecasts call for mostly stable readings for August: 2.8% for the headline number and 3.0% for the core reading. We think lingering inflation in certain sticky-priced services (transportation and shelter) will combine with tariff impacts to present a challenge for the Fed as it strives for its 2% goal. Overall, inflation in this cycle peaked in summer 2022 and has been on a fairly consistent downward trek since then. We track 20 inflation measures on a monthly basis. On average, they are indicating that prices are rising at a 2.7% rate year over year, up slightly compared to the month-ago level.
The numbers are volatile and can be distorted by swings within the Producer Price Inflation report. Focusing on core inflation -- which we obtain by averaging Core CPI, market-based PCE Ex-Food & Energy (from the GDP report), the five-year forward inflation expectation rate,
the 10-year TIPs Break-even Interest Rate and the PCE Price Index
-- our reading is 2.64%, up 1 basis point month over month. Given these inflation trends, as well as a recent slowdown in employment, we expect the Fed to implement two more rate cuts in 2H25 and one in 1H26, with the ultimate goal of aligning the fed funds rate to approximately 100-150 basis points above the long-term inflation rate within the next 3-4 quarters.

Market Digest: EAT, LEN, MU, WWW, ULTA, LIN
Stocks gave up some more ground on Wednesday and (probably not surprising) two-day losing streaks have not been very common since the secondary low traced out on April 21. The S&P 500 has given back only 0.9% over the past two days, so we can't make much out of it. The index fell 1.3% over the two days ending September 2, and 2% going into August. Prior to that, we have seen two-day losses of more than 1% only twice (in May). This illustrates what we all know: the mega-cap index has been in an extremely tight uptrend for multiple months, with very bullish price action. Despite the many reasons for a pullback (including overbought and divergent momentum, weakening breadth, high bullish sentiment, and lousy seasonals), the market has ignored the concerns and crawled higher.
We are in the weakest part of the year, as the back half of September historically has not been a good time to own stocks. But so far this year, there has not been much in the way of downside action. Going back to 1950, we can find average losses for every day of September starting with September 20 and extending until September 30. The larger losses tend to occur over the last six trading days of the month (which started on Tuesday this year).
By some measures, sentiment recently kicked into high gear, especially in the options market. The CBOE equity-only put/call (PC) ratio has been fairly low for the past two days, at 0.45 and 0.47. The average daily put/call in 2025 is around 0.60. The five-day has fallen to 0.5, the lowest in four months and just before a minor pullback. However, as long as the 21-day P/C is falling (and it is), it is bullish for stocks. Argus• 16 hours ago
