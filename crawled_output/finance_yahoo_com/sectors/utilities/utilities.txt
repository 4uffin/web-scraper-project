Market Update: CPB, LNT, MCK
Stocks are lower at midday. Federal Reserve Chairman Powell spoke yesterday and reaffirmed the well-documented problem that the Fed is facing over a labor market that is weakening and inflation that may creep higher. That and his suggestion that stocks prices are 'fairly highly valued' are seemingly weighing on investor sentiment. Argus• 6 hours ago
Analyst Report: Alliant Energy Corp.
Alliant Energy Corp is an electric and natural gas utility. The company has retail and wholesale electric distribution and retail gas operations. Electric-generating capacity is about 8 GW. The company has two primary regulated utility subsidiaries - Interstate Power and Light (IPL), and Wisconsin Power (WPL). These subsidiaries provide utility services to about one million electricity customers and approximately 425,000 natural gas customers. Alliant Energy Finance is the parent company for non-regulated operations.
The company still has coal operations, and its latest reported generation mix is 43% renewables (largely wind power), 37% natural gas, and 19% coal. LNT wants to phase out all coal generation as part of a plan to reach net-zero emissions by 2040. Regulators in Wisconsin and Iowa have been supportive of Alliant's efforts to invest in upgrades that will reduce carbon emissions. The company had planned to close its coal plant in Columbia County - its last remaining plant in Wisconsin - by the end of 2024. The closing date has been pushed out potentially to 2029 as Alliant evaluates converting at least one of the power plant's units to natural gas.
Annual revenues in 2024 were just under $4 billion, with 85% from electric utility operations. The company's two utilities: IPL and WPL each account for about 50% of revenues with retail operations contributing about 90% of 2024 revenues. The company's current market cap is about $16.6 billion. Rating
