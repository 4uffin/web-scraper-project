Analyst Report: MDU Resources Group Inc
MDU Resources Group Inc. is a natural gas utility with smaller electric utility operations. Through WBI, the company transports gas and controls 3,800 miles of pipeline in the Northern Plains and maintains one of the largest underground storage fields in North America. Through its four regulated utilities it provides generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity to 145,000 customers and gas to about 1 million customers. Utility service regions spread across eight states-WY, SD, MN, ND, ID, MT, WA, and OR. Compared with peers, the company has relatively modest generating capacity of about 700 MW. Its 2024 generation fuel mix is about 40% gas, 31% coal, and 29% renewable. Once its 2025 joint venture wind farm becomes fully operational, the fuel mix is projected to be 35% natural gas, 26% coal, and 39% renewables.
The company was founded in in 1924 as a small utility until it branched out into the construction industry. It spun off two construction service companies in 2023 and 2024. Restated 2024 operating revenues were $1.8 billion of which about half of 2024 electricity sales and about 40% gas sales were to commercial and industrial customers. At the end of 2024, the company's electric rate base is about $1.5 billion and its natural gas distribution rate base is about $1.9 billion.
After 1H25, about 37% of earnings are from pipeline operations, 36% from electricity, and 27% from gas distribution. The company is a member of the S&P Small Cap 600 Index. The company's market cap is about $3.4 billion. Rating

Market Digest: LVS, MDU, PFE, VMC, WEN, WYNN
As stocks continue to move higher (newly buoyed by interest rates that are officially on a downward trek), insiders continue to let off steam in what is arguably an increasingly toppy stock market. Still, with favorable seasonality in play through the end of 2025, it remains to be seem how much 'toppier' stocks can/will get.
The caution from insiders is in the higher end of the neutral range and, therefore, near the low end of the bearish range. On a scale where neutral sentiment runs from 2.00 to 6.00 and then bearish sentiment kicks in, the Total Eight-Week Sell/Buy Ratio from Vickers Stock Research (Vickers' broadest sell/buy measurement) is now 5.02. But it also has fallen into a very tight channel, as the ratio was 5.04 three weeks ago, 4.97 two weeks ago, and 4.90 last week. On a near-term basis and broken down by exchange, the highest degree of caution is coming from executives at companies that trade on the NYSE, as that exchange is currently posting a one-week ratio of 9.93. Relatively better is the one-week ratio for the Nasdaq, currently at 6.24. With the one-week readings running hotter than the eight-week results, a move into broad bearish sentiment is increasingly likely. End of day, insider sentiment is cautious and getting more cautious -- but not worthy of a 'run for the exits' response. This week, analysts at Vickers highlighted insider transactions of interest at Streamex Corp. (NCM: STEX) and Energy Vault Holdings Inc. (NYSE: NRGV). Argus• 3 hours ago
