Analyst Report: Entergy Corp.
Entergy Corp. is a vertically integrated utility, primarily with electric operations and relatively smaller natural gas operations, in the Gulf Coast region. The company has wholesale and retail electric operations through its five regulated subsidiaries. Its generation, transmission, and distribution operations serve about three million electric customers in AR, LA, MS, and TX. Entergy also serves about 200,000 natural gas customers and has almost 30 natural gas facilities. The company has about 16,000 transmission lines, 24 GW generating capacity, and operates five nuclear reactors. It purchases about 16% of its generating power. As of 2024, its generation mix was about 27% nuclear, 52% natural gas, 3% coal, and 2% renewable sources. Management projects it will retire its coal facilities by the end of 2030.
In 2024, revenues reached $11.9 billion, of which almost 98% were from electric operations. Of 2024 utility weather-adjusted electric retail sales, about 70% were to industrial and commercial customers and about half were from Entergy Louisiana. ETR had a 2-for-1 stock split with a trading date of December 13, 2024. The current market cap is about $39.4 billion. Rating

Market Update: ETR, BBWI
Stock indices are flat at midday on Friday, having been slightly higher early in the session but inching into the red as midday nears. Investors are monitoring conversations that are underway between President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping of China, with the trade relationship between the two companies the top issue.
Also likely on the agenda is the framework of a deal to keep TikTok operating in the U.S. Stocks are on track to move higher for the week, with traders processing the recent interest-rate cut, the conclusion of a generally pleasing earnings season, and inflation news that is mostly benign.
