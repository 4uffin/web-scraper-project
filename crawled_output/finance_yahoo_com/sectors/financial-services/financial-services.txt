Technical Assessment: Bullish in the Intermediate-Term
Stocks gave up some more ground on Wednesday and (probably not surprising) two-day losing streaks have not been very common since the secondary low traced out on April 21. The S&P 500 has given back only 0.9% over the past two days, so we can't make much out of it. The index fell 1.3% over the two days ending September 2, and 2% going into August. Prior to that, we have seen two-day losses of more than 1% only twice (in May). This illustrates what we all know: the mega-cap index has been in an extremely tight uptrend for multiple months, with very bullish price action. Despite the many reasons for a pullback (including overbought and divergent momentum, weakening breadth, high bullish sentiment, and lousy seasonals), the market has ignored the concerns and crawled higher.
We are in the weakest part of the year, as the back half of September historically has not been a good time to own stocks. But so far this year, there has not been much in the way of downside action. Going back to 1950, we can find average losses for every day of September starting with September 20 and extending until September 30. The larger losses tend to occur over the last six trading days of the month (which started on Tuesday this year).
By some measures, sentiment recently kicked into high gear, especially in the options market. The CBOE equity-only put/call (PC) ratio has been fairly low for the past two days, at 0.45 and 0.47. The average daily put/call in 2025 is around 0.60. The five-day has fallen to 0.5, the lowest in four months and just before a minor pullback. However, as long as the 21-day P/C is falling (and it is), it is bullish for stocks. (Mark Arbeter, CMT) Argus• 15 hours ago

Technical Assessment: Bullish in the Intermediate-Term
On Tuesday, Fed Chairman Powell put a stop to the equity rally, at least for one day, saying that equity prices are "fairly highly valued." He also commented that the Fed's job is challenging, as they must balance combating high inflation with signs of weakening labor markets. In other words, the Fed's dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability is stressed. Generally, the economy and prices move together -- but not at the moment. This has backed the Fed into a corner that, for now, most likely results in slower-than-normal moves in interest-rate policy. This too shall pass.
While the major indices remain close to all-time highs, the crypto currency market has been range bound. Indeed, recent price action is not reflecting a lot of confidence. Bitcoin (BTC) last peaked on August 13 at a closing all-time high of $123,375, which was followed by an intraday high of $124,530 the next day. We bring that up because August 14 represented a very ugly reversal that featured well-above-average volume. Sometimes short- to intermediate-term peaks can be rep-resented by a single day's price and volume. Since that peak, BTC fell to $108,300 on 8/31 and then rebounded to $117,100 on 9/18, which was a 61.8% retracement of the decline since the top. Now, BTC is fading again, sitting near $112,000. The level is important as it has acted as support and resistance a number of times. If it gives way, the recent lows will come into play, and we could see a decline to the $100,000 area, where a few key supports exist. The Commitment of Traders (COT) data for BTC is bearish and has been accurate the past few years. (Mark Arbeter, CMT) Argus• yesterday
