Technical Assessment: Bullish in the Intermediate-Term
Stock indices saw nice gains again on Monday, as the technology road grader (AI) keeps grinding along. Monday it was tech and only tech, as the sector ETF (XLK) popped 1.5%. Other than the very low-weighted Utilities sector, which rose 1%, there were minor gains in Real Estate and Industrials and losses or no movement in the seven other S&P 500 sectors. NYSE breadth was flat and NYSE advancing volume versus declining volume also was even. Yet the S&P 500 gained 0.4%, the S&P 100 added 0.5%, the Nasdaq rose 0.7%, and the Nasdaq 100 was up 0.6%. We did see some continued participation by the small-cap indices and even the Russell 2000 crept into all-time high territory last week.
The mega-cap dominance continues and the daily moves in these behemoths remains jaw dropping. Computer hardware popped 4%, led by AAPL's 4.3% surge. Semiconductors climbed about 2% (depending on which index you use), aided by NVDA's 4% spike as well as a 3% gain by TSM. Semi equipment names remain on fire, with LRCX, AMAT, and KLAC all adding between 2.5% and 5.5%. Components of the computer services and electrical components industries also had a big day.
It certainly feels like we are in the melt-up stage of the rally that started back in April, as the major indices have once again reached overbought conditions on the daily charts and have cycled into overbought territory on a weekly basis. The price action has been steep since early September, and the angle of ascent is starting to accelerate on the Nasdaq and the QQQ. While this can go on for some time, it is a warning.
