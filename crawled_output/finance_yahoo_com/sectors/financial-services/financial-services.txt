Technical Assessment: Bullish in the Intermediate-Term
On Tuesday, Fed Chairman Powell put a stop to the equity rally, at least for one day, saying that equity prices are "fairly highly valued." He also commented that the Fed's job is challenging, as they must balance combating high inflation with signs of weakening labor markets. In other words, the Fed's dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability is stressed. Generally, the economy and prices move together -- but not at the moment. This has backed the Fed into a corner that, for now, most likely results in slower-than-normal moves in interest-rate policy. This too shall pass.
While the major indices remain close to all-time highs, the crypto currency market has been range bound. Indeed, recent price action is not reflecting a lot of confidence. Bitcoin (BTC) last peaked on August 13 at a closing all-time high of $123,375, which was followed by an intraday high of $124,530 the next day. We bring that up because August 14 represented a very ugly reversal that featured well-above-average volume. Sometimes short- to intermediate-term peaks can be rep-resented by a single day's price and volume. Since that peak, BTC fell to $108,300 on 8/31 and then rebounded to $117,100 on 9/18, which was a 61.8% retracement of the decline since the top. Now, BTC is fading again, sitting near $112,000. The level is important as it has acted as support and resistance a number of times. If it gives way, the recent lows will come into play, and we could see a decline to the $100,000 area, where a few key supports exist. The Commitment of Traders (COT) data for BTC is bearish and has been accurate the past few years. (Mark Arbeter, CMT) Argus• 13 hours ago
