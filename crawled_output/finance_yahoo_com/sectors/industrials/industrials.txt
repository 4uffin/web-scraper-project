Analyst Report: FedEx Corporation
FedEx pioneered overnight delivery in 1973 and remains the world's largest express package provider. In fiscal 2025, the firm's Federal Express segment—which houses the core package delivery operations—made up 86% of total revenue, with 10% coming from FedEx Freight, its asset-based less-than-truckload shipping segment. The remainder came from other services, including FedEx Office, which provides document production/shipping, and FedEx Logistics, which provides global forwarding. FedEx acquired Dutch parcel delivery firm TNT Express in 2016, boosting its presence across Europe. TNT was previously the fourth-largest global parcel delivery provider.

Weekly Stock List
Aerospace & defense design and manufacturing is one of the core competencies of the U.S. economy, along with innovative technology, allocating capital, and pharmaceutical R&D. In our view, the sector is positioned for solid growth over the next few years. During 2025, global revenues for the total aerospace & defense industry are expected to grow by 6% from 2025 and reach $950 billion, as tracked by The Business Research Company. Looking ahead, industry forecasts call for the sector to grow at a CAGR of 5.8% and top $1.1 trillion by 2028. Drilling down, the recovering global airline industry bodes well for commercial aerospace demand over the next several years. Airline passenger levels and airline revenues are once again growing at a healthy pace, and with international markets reopened, we believe that the industry will be able to recover a substantial amount of its pre-COVID-19 revenues and profitability into 2026. We also expect solid military spending over the next few years. According to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, annualized federal spending on national defense was running at an $871 billion rate in 2Q25. That's up 6% year over year. On top of the country's typical strong commitment to defense spending, the budget has been influenced by the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine, the bombing in Iran, rising inflation, and other factors. We expect the current geopolitical environment to keep this type of spending high for some time to come. Here is a list of some of the aerospace & defense stocks that we like. Argus• 12 hours ago
Technical Assessment: Bullish in the Intermediate-Term
If you didn't get enough of Chairman Powell and all the closet economists last week, you will get your fill and then some this week. Fed presidents, governors, vice chairs, and even the Fed chairman are due to hit the airwaves. Maybe that's a good thing, because economic news is otherwise sparse (August PCE on Friday) and there only a few big earnings reports (AZO, MU, ACN, JBL, and COST).
Last week was another good period for the major indices, as stocks continue to move deeper into unchartered territory. The S&P 500 (SPX) rose 1.2%, the S&P 100 was up 1.6%, the Invesco S&P 500 Top 50 ETF (XLG) popped 1.7%, and the Nasdaq and Nasdaq 100 both tacked on 2.2%. Small-caps participated once again, rising 2.2% on the week. The SPX has gained ground in 16 of the past 24 weeks (since the April bottom). The advance has been very tight and, historically, that is bullish. Since jumping over the 21-day exponential average on April 24, price has closed below that line only one time.
Last week again featured risk, as the three highest-ranked sectors from a technical basis led, with Technology ripping higher by 3%, Communication Services gaining 1.8%, and Discretionary adding 1.2%. Industrials rose 1%, while Financial was up 0.8%. The six weakest sectors technically all fell, with Real Estate and Staples losing 1.2%, Materials off 0.8%, and Utilities and Healthcare dropping 0.6%.
The Commitment of Traders (CO)T data remains bullish for the S&P 500 and the Russell 2000 and slightly bearish for the Nasdaq 100 (which has improved over the past month). The data also remains bullish for the dollar and West Texas Intermediate, and bearish for Bitcoin. (Mark Arbeter, CMT) Argus• 13 hours ago
