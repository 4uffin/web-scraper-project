You can find original article here Nrn. Subscribe to our free daily Nrn newsletters. McDonald’s has added two new executives to its global impact team, including Kathy Baird, who will take over as chief impact officer for McDonald’s USA effective Sept. 30, and Anne Hammer, who was named vice president and global chief communications officer, effective Oct. 14.
“The global impact team at McDonald’s brings together the collective strength of teams dedicated to elevating and protecting the Golden Arches — driving growth, transforming our business, and making a positive difference in the world around us. I’m incredibly proud to welcome Kathy and Anne to our ranks as they help carry forward this team’s powerful legacy of global community impact,” executive vice president and global chief impact officer Jon Banner said in a statement. In her new role, Baird will oversee teams responsible for enhancing and protecting the McDonald’s brand across state and local government relations, brand and business communications, and sustainability. The sustainability team will continue to report into the supply chain division.
Baird will serve on both the U.S. senior leadership team and the global impact leadership team, reporting to McDonald’s USA president Joe Erlinger and Banner. She brings more than 25 years of experience across Fortune 500 companies, government, nonprofits, media, and leading agencies. Baird most recently served as chief communications officer at The Washington Post, where she oversaw brand marketing, live journalism, and talent development. Prior, Baird led global purpose communications at Nike, spearheading civic engagement campaigns, elevating diverse voices, and launching innovative employee storytelling platforms. “I’m thrilled to join McDonald’s and help build on a legacy that’s shaped communities and earned trust across generations. This brand means so much to so many, including me, and I am grateful for the opportunity to shape the next chapter and champion this brand’s role at the center of culture,” Baird said in a statement.
As global chief communications officer, Hammer is tasked with elevating and protecting the brand and driving growth for the business through storytelling. Her leadership will be instrumental in advancing the company’s Communications Center of Excellence. She will serve on the global impact leadership team, reporting to Banner. Hammer most recently served as the global chief communications officer at Manulife. She also previously served as John Hancock’s chief communications officer and the global head of public relations at State Street.
Story Continues
“Few companies have the global reach and cultural resonance of McDonald’s, nearly everyone in the world has an impression of this brand. The ways we consume news and information has never been more dynamic and I’m eager to join one of the best communications teams in the business to drive stories of progress and impact together,” Hammer said in a statement.&nbsp; Contact Alicia Kelso at Alicia.Kelso@informa.com &nbsp; &nbsp;
