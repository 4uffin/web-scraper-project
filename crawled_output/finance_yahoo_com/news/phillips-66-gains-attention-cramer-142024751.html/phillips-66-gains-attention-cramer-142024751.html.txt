Phillips 66 Gains Attention as Cramer Calls It a Timely Buy

PSX
Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) is one of the 12 Jim Cramer Stock Picks this Week. ‘Mad Money’ host Jim Cramer has mentioned that now is the right time to buy this stock.
Phillips 66 Gains Attention as Cramer Calls It a Timely Buy
The earnings call transcript of Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) released on July 25, 2025, indicated a record-high refining utilization rate of 98% since 2018. The Midstream segment’s adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1 billion further indicated that the company is progressing towards achieving its $4.5 billion annual EBITDA target by 2027.
On September 11, 2025, a Bloomberg article wrote that the company is looking to buy liquefied natural gas from the U.S. through long-term contracts. According to people familiar with the matter, interviewed by Bloomberg, the company is also hiring staff in Houston to do this. Though no official statement has been released by Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX), the news has piqued the interest of investors and analysts alike, as Piper Sandler elevated the stock’s price target from $144 to $154. With 47 hedge funds holding ownership stakes, the company benefits from strong institutional interest. Jim Cramer’s statement that now would be the right time to buy this stock in the lightning round, where he gave answers to callers’ stock questions at rapid speed, further suggests an anticipated stock growth.
Founded in 2012 and headquartered in Texas, Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) was formed as a spin-off from ConocoPhillips. It is a diversified energy manufacturing and logistics company engaged in businesses that include refining, midstream, chemicals, marketing, and specialties. While we acknowledge the potential of PSX as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk. If you're looking for an extremely undervalued AI stock that also stands to benefit significantly from Trump-era tariffs and the onshoring trend, see our free report on the best short-term AI stock.
