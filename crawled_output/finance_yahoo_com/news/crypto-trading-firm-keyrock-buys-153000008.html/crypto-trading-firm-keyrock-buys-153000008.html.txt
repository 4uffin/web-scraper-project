Crypto trading firm Keyrock said it's expanding into asset and wealth management by acquiring Turing Capital, a Luxembourg-registered alternative investment fund manager. The deal, announced on Tuesday, marks the launch of Keyrock’s Asset and Wealth Management division, a new business unit dedicated to institutional clients and private investors.

Keyrock, founded in Brussels, Belgium and best known for its work in market making, options and OTC trading, said it will fold Turing Capital’s investment strategies and Luxembourg fund management structure into its wider platform. The division will be led by Turing Capital co-founder Jorge Schnura, who joins Keyrock’s executive committee as president of the unit. The company said the expansion will allow it to provide services across the full lifecycle of digital assets, from liquidity provision to long-term investment strategies. "In the near future, all assets will live onchain," Schnura said, noting that the merger positions the group to capture opportunities as traditional financial products migrate to blockchain rails. Keyrock has also applied for regulatory approval under the EU’s crypto framework MiCA through a filing with Liechtenstein’s financial regulator. If approved, the firm plans to offer portfolio management and advisory services, aiming to compete directly with traditional asset managers as well as crypto-native players. "Today’s launch sets the stage for our longer-term ambition: bringing asset management on-chain in a way that truly meets institutional standards," Keyrock CSO Juan David Mendieta said in a statement.
