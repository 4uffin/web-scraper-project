Tylenol-maker Kenvue shares bounce back, Trump claims face pushback

KVUE
By Sriparna Roy (Reuters) -Kenvue's (KVUE) shares climbed 6% on Tuesday, rebounding from a record low hit in the previous session, as analysts pointed to the lack of new scientific evidence from the White House to support President Donald Trump linking the drugmaker's popular pain reliever Tylenol to autism.
Trump on Monday linked autism to childhood vaccine use and the taking of Tylenol, known generically as paracetamol, by women when pregnant, elevating claims not backed by scientific evidence to the forefront of U.S. health policy. "Investors were holding their breath worried that yesterday's announcement would be a bombshell. It turned out it wasn't, as no new scientific evidence was presented linking Tylenol to autism," said James Harlow, vice president at Novare Capital Management.
European Union and British health agencies also confirmed the safety of paracetamol during pregnancy, while the World Health Organization said evidence of a link remained inconsistent and urged caution in drawing conclusions. Tylenol generates roughly $1 billion in annual sales for Kenvue, according to an estimate from brokerage Morningstar.
Shares slumped to an all-time low on Monday, ahead of the conference where Trump repeatedly warned against the use of the painkiller and suggesting that common vaccines not be taken together or so early in a child's life. Many doctors reject the claim, and Kenvue, spun off from Johnson & Johnson in 2023, reiterated there is no scientific link between acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, and autism, warning that such suggestions could endanger maternal health. "Overall, we see limited judicial risk following [Monday's] announcement, but there could be some impact on Tylenol consumption due to negative headlines," Citi analysts wrote in a note. The Food and Drug Administration said it will update labels on Tylenol and generic versions to reflect evidence of a possible link between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and neurological conditions such as autism and ADHD, but stressed that no causal relationship has been established. "This issue only involves pregnant mothers which is a smaller subset of consumers – therefore the actual impact on Kenvue's financials was likely always going to be modest," said Harlow.
