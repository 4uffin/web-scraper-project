LLY
Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is included among the 13 Best Consistent Dividend Stocks to Buy Now.
Eli Lilly (LLY)'s Pharmaceutical Leadership as a Driver of Consistent Dividends
Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is an Indiana-based multinational pharmaceutical company. Analysts expect the company to remain a leader in the rapidly expanding weight-loss market at least through the end of the decade. Its drug tirzepatide, marketed as Mounjaro and Zepbound for diabetes and obesity, is projected to generate nearly $62 billion in sales by 2030, a remarkable milestone for any pharmaceutical product.
Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) also boasts one of the strongest pipelines in this space. Orforglipron has already delivered outstanding results by helping diabetes patients lower their A1C levels and lose weight, supporting future revenue growth. In addition, the company has several other promising candidates in development within this field. Apart from its drug pipeline, Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) also gains traction among investors because of its dividend history. The company’s dividend growth spans 11 years, which makes it one of the best dividend stocks on our list. Currently, it offers a quarterly dividend of $1.50 per share and has a dividend yield of 0.79%, as of September 12. While we acknowledge the potential of LLY as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk. If you’re looking for an extremely undervalued AI stock that also stands to benefit significantly from Trump-era tariffs and the onshoring trend, see our free report on the best short-term AI stock.
