Lyft to Tell Drivers If Riders Tip, Are on Time Before Matching

LYFT
UBER
(Bloomberg) — Lyft Inc. is testing a feature that will tell drivers how often a rider tips and how punctual they are, providing additional information drivers can use when deciding which trips are worth their time. Lyft drivers typically decide whether to accept a passenger based on information such as what the trip pays, the time and distance to the pick-up and drop-off points, and the rider’s rating.

The company is now also showing “rider tipped on X% of rides” and “rider is usually ready at pickup,” according to a screenshot shared by a Boston-based driver on X. Lyft is testing the feature with a “limited number” of drivers, a spokesperson said in response to a Bloomberg News inquiry, and said the company will gather data and community feedback before deciding on a broader roll-out.
For Lyft, which owns about 30% of the US rideshare market, releasing new features that benefit drivers can help it win over drivers from its larger rival Uber Technologies Inc. Having more drivers on the road can in turn help reduce wait times and trip prices for passengers. Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek
