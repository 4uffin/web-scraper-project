Oil Advances as Geopolitical Tensions Between NATO, Russia Rise

(Bloomberg) -- Oil advanced after the North Atlantic Treaty Organization promised a “robust” response to Russian incursions into its airspace, adding to concerns over flows of Russian supply. Global benchmark Brent rose above $67 a barrel after slipping 2.8% over the previous four sessions, while West Texas Intermediate climbed near $63. NATO said it would use all options, including military, to defend itself. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio reaffirmed the American commitment to NATO, as the Russian government evaluates a potential diesel-export ban for some companies amid a spate of attacks by Ukrainian drones on the nation’s oil refineries.

“We have seen quite a bit of a turnaround following the four-day slide, once again confirming oil traders are playing the well-established range,” according to Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank. “The Russia supply story remains an underlying supportive factor helping offset rising supply from other OPEC+ members.”
Meanwhile, Iraq may shortly resume exports via Kurdistan after a two-year halt over a payment dispute. That could see about 230,000 barrels a day return to international markets, according to people familiar with the matter. A rapid return of shuttered barrels by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, as well as increased production from outside the group, have seen market watchers including the International Energy Agency warn that supplies are set to top demand by a record margin. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said he wanted to see Western allies ramp up pressure on President Vladimir Putin with secondary sanctions on countries working with Russia. That follows recent remarks from President Donald Trump, who has urged European countries to stop buying Russian energy, although the US has so far spared China — the biggest buyer of Moscow’s barrels — from additional tariffs.   --With assistance from Sarah Chen and Charlie Zhu.
