Robotics startup Figure valued at $39 billion in latest funding round

(This story has been refiled to remove the picture) By Pritam Biswas (Reuters) - AI robotics company Figure said on Tuesday it had received over $1 billion in committed capital in its latest funding round that valued the firm at $39 billion post money. The Series C round was led by Parkway Venture Capital, and also saw participation from industry majors such as Nvidia, Intel Capital, LG Technology Ventures, Salesforce, T-Mobile Ventures, and Qualcomm Ventures.
Venture capital firms have been pouring massive amounts into companies that leverage artificial intelligence, helping them stay private for longer. U.S. startup funding is set to hit its second-highest total on record, up 75.6% in the first half of 2025, driven by the ongoing AI surge, according to a report by Pitchbook. Figure's new funding round also valued the autonomous robot developer sharply higher than the $2.6 billion last year, when it secured $675 million from investors such as Microsoft and Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos. "Investors increasingly view humanoids in the same league as foundational AI models or EVs," said Ali Javaheri, emerging technology analyst at PitchBook. "The surge in VC interest in humanoids is being driven by structural demand-side factors like aging workforces and geopolitical competition, paired with supply-side advances in AI software and hardware breakthroughs."
Startups and major tech companies such as Nvidia, Meta Platforms and Tesla are racing to develop humanoid robots to tackle labor shortages and handle repetitive, hazardous tasks in logistics, manufacturing and household chores. San Jose, California-based Figure will use the capital to scale humanoid robots into homes and commercial operations, build on its infrastructure to accelerate training and simulation, and double down on its data collection efforts. "This milestone is critical to unlocking the next stage of growth for humanoid robots, scaling out our AI platform Helix and BotQ manufacturing," Figure founder and CEO Brett Adcock said. Figure's funding round also saw investment from other big investors such as Brookfield Asset Management, Macquarie Capital, Align Ventures and Tamarack Global.
