Alibaba’s AI push comes as Chinese tech giants race to develop large language models. - go nakamura/Reuters
Alibaba shares jumped after the company said it would invest more than $53 billion in artificial intelligence—above its original target—and released a new model. The Chinese tech titan’s stock rallied on Wednesday, helping it more than double gains so far this year. Its Hong Kong-listed shares ended the day 9.2% higher, outperforming the Hang Seng Tech Index’s 2.5% advance.

Alibaba’s U.S.-listed shares jumped more than 8%. The Hangzhou-based company’s latest upswing came after Chief Executive Eddie Wu said it would increase spending on AI and cloud infrastructure beyond the 380 billion yuan pledged in February, equivalent to $53 billion, to be deployed over three years. He didn’t provide a new target. “The AI industry has developed much faster than we expected, and demand for AI infrastructure has also far exceeded our expectations,” Wu said. Further fueling optimism was Qwen3-Max, the latest addition to Alibaba’s AI model series, which it describes as its largest and most capable large language model yet. Alibaba’s push comes as Chinese tech giants race to develop LLMs to rival offerings from foreign companies. Baidu, Tencent Holdings and TikTok parent ByteDance have all rolled out their own products, while homegrown startups such as DeepSeek are also rapidly gaining ground.
The preview version of Qwen3-Max ranks among the top AI models globally, according to third-party benchmark LMArena, right behind models from Google’s Gemini, Anthropic’s Claude and OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Alibaba is also doubling down on efforts to build homegrown chips, a crucial foundation for training and deploying the Qwen3-Max model. By advancing such models, alongside its homegrown chip ecosystem, the tech giant is signaling its ambition to control the full AI stack—from hardware to cloud services to application. Another tailwind for Alibaba’s stock came in the form of news that two of Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest funds reopened positions in the tech company, signaling a rekindling of interest from abroad in Chinese tech. The two funds’ investments in Alibaba’s American depositary shares total around $16.3 million, according to holdings reports. Securities and Exchange Commission filings show that this is Ark’s first investment or proxy voting record in Alibaba since September 2021, when the Chinese internet giant was grappling with a regulatory crackdown on the country’s tech sector.
Story Continues
Alibaba’s investment plan and model release add to a broader upswing in Chinese tech stocks, which have been powering equities markets onshore and offshore as advancements bolster investors’ conviction in China’s AI sector. In Hong Kong, SMIC—the largest contract chip maker in China—rose as much as 7.8%, while China’s No. 2 foundry, Hua Hong, advanced as much as 9.0%. Naura Technology, the country’s biggest chip-equipment maker, climbed by the 10% daily limit in Shanghai.
“China is building up a self-contained virtuous cycle” in the AI supply chain, Morningstar analyst Phelix Lee said. A flurry of AI progress by Chinese tech giants “signals stronger confidence in the performance of China-made models, which supports demand for semiconductors, benefiting both foundries like SMIC & Hua Hong and upstream equipment plays,” he said. “The AI industry has developed much faster than we expected, and demand for AI infrastructure has also far exceeded our expectations,” Wu said.
