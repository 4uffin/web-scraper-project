By Tatiana Bautzer NEW YORK (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley is combining two investment banking teams, Global Energy and Global Power and Utilities, into a new Global Power and Energy Group, according to an internal memo sent to the investment banking division on Wednesday, a copy of which was seen by Reuters.
The group co-heads will be Jon Fouts and Michael O’Dwyer and the merger of the teams aims to adapt to the changes in the global energy landscape, with accelerating demand for power from both traditional and renewable sources, the memo said. Fouts has been global head of power and utilities since 2022 while O'Dwyer was global head of energy. Morgan Stanley declined to comment. Eddie Mannheimer will lead North America power and utilities investment banking and Ryan Synnott will head Houston energy investment banking, according to the memo. For Europe, Middle East and Africa, the leaders will be Francesco Puletti, for power and utilities, and Mutlu Guner, for energy. (Reporting by Tatiana Bautzer; Editing by Emelia Sithole-Matarise)
