Instant view: Nvidia's $5 billion bet on Intel
Reuters
Thu, Sep 18, 2025, 6:51 AM 6 min read
In this article:
INTC
NVDA
(Reuters) - Nvidia said on Thursday it will invest $5 billion in Intel, throwing its heft behind the struggling U.S. chip foundry weeks after the White House engineered a deal for the U.S. government to take a massive stake in the company. Nvidia's support represents a new opening for Intel after years of turnaround efforts at the famed U.S. manufacturer failed to pay off. Intel shares climbed more than 25% in early trading.
Here are some comments from analysts on this deal. COMMENTS: NANCY TENGLER, CEO AND CIO AT LAFFER TENGLER INVESTMENTS "The private sector can and will solve the INTC technology problem—one way or another—the government has an abysmal record in trying to do so. My guess? This may be the first step of an acquisition or break-up of the company among U.S. chip makers though it is entirely possible the company will remain a shadow of its former self but will survive." STEVE SOSNICK, CHIEF MARKET ANALYST, INTERACTIVE BROKERS, CONNECTICUT "The $5 billion investment is a relatively minor one from NVDA's point of view, but highly significant for INTC. It gives them a direction and a role in AI chip development that it didn't have yesterday. That's why INTC stock is reacting so strongly to the news while causing only a modest rise in NVDA."
"The open question, which I hope we'll learn the answer to later, is how much of a role the Administration played in this deal. It was reported that the President would be speaking with (Nvidia CEO) Jensen Huang, so it is probably not a coincidence. It certainly raises the value of the government's investment, but it could call into question the idea of the government picking winners and losers since the deal is not good news for AMD because the INTC/NVDA linkup makes them a more formidable competitor." PIPER SANDLER ANALYSTS "We think this initiative protects NVDA against a core competency that AMD currently holds, as AMD has been steadily gaining share and highlighting the role of its server CPUs in AI infrastructure."
"In addition, the partnership extends to personal computing, with NVDA contributing RTX GPU chiplets to INTC's x86 CPUs. We view this development as a positive for NVIDIA and a negative for AMD over the longer-term." GADJO SEVILLA, SENIOR AI AND TECH ANALYST, EMARKETER "This is a massive game changer for Intel and effectively resets its position of AI-laggard into a cog in future AI infrastructure. Nvidia's investment and 4% to 5% ownership of Intel ensures Intel's short-term survival, opens the door for a larger takeover (not likely due to antitrust), and gives Nvidia a direct line to Intel's foundry business for future GPU production."
Story Continues
"For Nvidia: The first thing that comes to mind is it reduces regulatory pressure. Nvidia can't be considered a monopolist if it is spreading the wealth to a key competitor. The $5 billion investment is small in terms of Nvidia's scale but it generates goodwill while giving it access to Intel's chip and GPU pipeline resulting in a new generation of Nvidia-Intel chips and AI servers that will likely be in high demand."
DAVID WAGNER, HEAD OF EQUITY AND PORTFOLIO MANAGER AT APTUS CAPITAL ADVISORS "This is truly like the Yankees and the Red Sox coming together to end their rivalry - the companies did not like each other whatsoever. It's a massive step in the right direction (utilizing INTC's fab to make chips) for US chip designers, and breathes new life into a poorly run company for decades. " RUSS MOULD, INVESTMENT DIRECTOR AT AJ BELL: "Nvidia's decision to invest in Intel makes sense on several levels. It keeps the Trump presidency sweet as it can demonstrate it is backing American firms on American soil. It also enables the company to diversify supply chain risk." "From Intel's point of view, the cash injection will help. Even if the balance sheet is not heavily geared, with net debt of $29.6 billion against stockholders' equity of $106 billion, adding financial gearing to operational gearing is not ideal, and anything to reduce that will be welcome."
"The technological vote of approval from Nvidia will also be welcome, even if the investment does not lead to an immediate manufacturing or foundry deal, thanks to the plan to jointly develop PC and data centre chips." MATT BRITZMAN, SENIOR EQUITY ANALYST, HARGREAVES LANSDOWN: "Nvidia's $5 billion investment in Intel is less about money and more about influence." "For Intel, this is another welcome boost, both financially and strategically, as it leans on Nvidia to stay competitive. But even with the U.S. government and Nvidia on side, it's one step short of a home run for the foundry business, which is struggling to attract the major customers it needs to succeed against the might of TSMC." "For Nvidia, the financial impact is small, but the political upside is big: this move aligns with U.S. policy and could help ease restrictions on selling advanced chips to China. It also signals a shift in industry dynamics, with Arm losing some exclusivity and AMD facing more pressure. In short, this is a strategic alliance with geopolitical undertones, not just a balance-sheet transaction."
ROBERT PAVLIK, SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER AT DAKOTA WEALTH "The association with NVIDIA helps a lot, just having access to their intellectual property. For a company that's sort of struggling to develop AI-needed products, it goes a long way and helps sort of stabilize and give some credence to a company that has been under question for some time." "It's a good move. NVIDIA certainly has the cash to do it. So, why not? Why not try to make an investment and see what happens with it?" CHRIS BEAUCHAMP, CHIEF MARKET ANALYST AT IG GROUP, LONDON "It's impressive to see the (share) move and once again from the U.S. government taking a stake in Intel and then Nvidia sprinkling its magic is going to move the share price."
"It's a reflection of Nvidia looking to diversify to an extent its investment within the U.S. and as well to gain some brownie points with the U.S. government." "It doesn't change the bigger problem which Nvidia is facing with China, but it keeps it in favor with the U.S. government." "It's a sign that Nvidia has to broaden out its own operation and it's a sign of Intel looking to become far more of a player within the market." IPEK OZKARDESKAYA, SENIOR ANALYST AT SWISSQUOTE BANK "What Intel needs right now is a viable model and to make sure that clients are interested in this product. So this agreement from Nvidia to invest as much as $5 billion to somehow co-develop chips for PCs and data centers is fresh news for Intel.
"Intel needed a partner and Nvidia is the best partner for a company where investors are mostly in doubt about the future and the company's ability to get back on the seat having lost the AI turn." "For Nvidia, it is possible that this decision is politically backed because what the U.S. government wants is these companies producing chips in the United States and they have also taken a stake in Intel in order to force them to build that Ohio plant, which would be one of the world's biggest chip making plants in the U.S. " (Reporting by Johann M Cherian, Shaswat Chauhan, Deborah Sophia, Akriti Shah, Sukriti Gupta, Purvi Agarwal and Harshita Mary Varghese in Bengaluru and Tristan Veyet in Gdansk; compiled by Arpan Varghese; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila)
