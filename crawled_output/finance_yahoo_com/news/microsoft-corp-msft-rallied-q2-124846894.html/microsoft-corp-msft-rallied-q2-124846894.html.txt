Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) Rallied in Q2, Driven by Azure growth

MSFT
Macquarie Asset Management, an investment management company, released its “Macquarie Large Cap Growth Fund” investor letter for the second quarter of 2025. A copy of the letter can be downloaded here. The second quarter of 2025 endured significant government policy changes and geopolitical events, which resulted in volatility yet ended with robust performance for equity markets. The Fund’s Institutional Class shares posted an absolute positive return of 11.24% in the quarter, but underperformed the benchmark, the Russell 1000 Growth Index, which returned 17.84%. For more information on the fund’s best picks in 2025, please check its top five holdings.
In its second-quarter 2025 investor letter, the Macquarie Large Cap Growth Fund highlighted stocks such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a multinational software company that develops and supports software, services, devices, and solutions. The one-month return of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) was 2.71%, and its shares gained 19.47% of their value over the last 52 weeks. On September 19, 2025, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock closed at $517.93 per share, with a market capitalization of $3.85 trillion. Macquarie Large Cap Growth Fund stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter: "The largest contributors were our underweight to Apple Inc., underweight to Eli Lilly and Co., and position in Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). Microsoft, a significant position in the portfolio, rallied following better-than-expected results. The business demonstrated strength across every segment, but what particularly encouraged the market was accelerated growth of its cloud computing platform Azure. While AI services continue to contribute meaningfully to Azure growth, the segment also saw strength in Azure cloud (non-AI) services as companies continue to recognize the importance of moving from on-premises to cloud."
Microsoft (MSFT) Stock: Truist Raises Price Target to $675, Reiterates Buy
