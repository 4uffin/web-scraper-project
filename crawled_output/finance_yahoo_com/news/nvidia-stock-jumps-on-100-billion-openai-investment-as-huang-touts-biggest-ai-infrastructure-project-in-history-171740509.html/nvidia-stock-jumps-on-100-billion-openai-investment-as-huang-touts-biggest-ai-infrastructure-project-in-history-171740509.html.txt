Nvidia stock jumps on $100 billion OpenAI investment as Huang touts 'biggest AI infrastructure project in history'

Nvidia (NVDA) stock jumped roughly 4% on Monday as the chipmaker announced it will invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI as part of a new partnership. Nvidia said in its announcement that the partnership will allow OpenAI to deploy "at least 10 gigawatts" of compute capacity from the chipmaker's AI systems to train and run the ChatGPT maker's next generation of artificial intelligence models. The first phase of that compute capacity utilizing Nvidia's upcoming Vera Rubin platform is set to come online in the second half of 2026, according to the company.
Read more about Nvidia's stock moves and market action. AI apps are widely powered by Nvidia's AI systems built on its GPUs (graphics processing units), or AI chips, that fill remote data centers across the country. "This is the biggest AI infrastructure project in history," CEO Jensen Huang said in an interview with CNBC Monday. According to Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya, the deal could generate as much as $500 billion in revenue for the AI chipmaker.
"NVIDIA and OpenAI have pushed each other for a decade, from the first DGX supercomputer to the breakthrough of ChatGPT," Huang said in a separate statement. Nvidia's stock closed at $183.61 on Monday, topping its previous record high from August. Shares tipped slightly lower in early trading on Tuesday. The AI chipmaker is the world's most valuable company, with a market capitalization above $4 trillion. The OpenAI-Nvidia deal is an ambitious undertaking for the companies. For reference, Meta's mammoth 4 million square foot AI data center under construction in Louisiana is set to deliver about two gigawatts of compute capacity — around one fifth of the power OpenAI and Nvidia are promising to deliver. The plan to deploy 10 gigawatts of capacity would equate to 4 million to 5 million of Nvidia's GPUs, according to CFRA analyst Angelo Zino.
Nvidia's OpenAI deal comes as the company rapidly expands its AI investments. Last week, Nvidia took a $5 billion stake in fellow chipmaker Intel (INTC), part of a partnership to use Intel's CPUs (central processing units) in Nvidia's AI systems. The AI giant also announced plans to deploy tens of thousands of AI chips across the UK. It also signed a $6.3 billion deal with CoreWeave (CRWV) that guarantees Nvidia will purchase unsold compute capacity from the AI data center operator. "While some still raise concerns about AI being a potential bubble, Nvidia’s investment signals that the need for AI infrastructure is real and still expanding," Carnegie Investment Counsel director of research Greg Halter said.
Story Continues
OpenAI, meanwhile, has been moving to secure more AI data center capacity despite concerns over the company's ability to grow profitably. The tech firm recently signed a $300 billion deal to purchase computing power from Oracle (ORCL) over the next five years, according to the Wall Street Journal.
"While the announcement is positive for OpenAI's ability to ramp, we are concerned NVDA has become the 'investor of last resort,' bailing out OpenAI's overextended commitments," DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria wrote in a note following the announcement, adding that "OpenAI has been making commitments well beyond its means." He pointed to OpenAI's Oracle deal, the company's $100 billion plan to rent backup cloud servers over the next five years, and its $25 billion commitment to CoreWeave. "[W]e would like to see more traditional investors step up to fund the great data center buildout," Luria added. "It is not healthy that the only investor willing to fund OpenAI's ambitions at this scale is their chip provider who will get most of that investment back as chip sales," he added in a separate email to Yahoo Finance. Nvidia's jump on Monday put the stock on track to close near its previous record high above $183 in August. The AI chipmaker is the world's most valuable company, with a market capitalization above $4 trillion.
