NBA Star Kevin Durant Forgot His Coinbase Password—And Bitcoin Soared 11,000%

Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below. Kevin Durant forgot his Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) password, which turned into an unexpected blessing. The NBA star, who first started buying Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) during his Golden State Warriors days in 2016, still hasn't regained access to his account, according to CBNC.
Durant's Bitcoin Journey According to his longtime business partner and agent, Rich Kleiman, Durant became curious about cryptocurrency after a dinner with teammates who wouldn't stop talking about it. The very next day, they began purchasing bitcoin. Back then, prices hovered between $360 and $1,000. Today, bitcoin trades near $116,000—an increase of more than 11,000%.
Trending: Would you have invested in eBay or Uber early? The same backers are betting on this vacation home platform at just $2.90 per share. Locked Out, Cashing In Strangely enough, being locked out of Durant's Coinbase account turned into an advantage. "We've yet to be able to track down his Coinbase account info, so we've never sold anything, and this bitcoin is just through the roof," Kleiman noted during CNBC's Game Plan conference in Los Angeles.
While most investors might panic at not having access, Durant's camp sees it as a form of "forced holding." Efforts To Regain Access Kleiman explained that they've been in contact with Coinbase trying to resolve a "user error" that blocked access. But at the same time, they have maintained a positive relationship with the platform. Durant and Kleiman are not only investors in Coinbase Global but also partnered with the company in 2021 through their firm, Thirty Five Ventures.
See Also: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it? Coinbase's Role Coinbase, in response, reminded CNBC that customers can generally reset their passwords using its built-in tools and can reach around-the-clock support for more complicated recovery issues. Still, Durant's experience highlights both the risks of misplaced login information and the accidental upside of long-term investing without the temptation to sell.

Building Wealth Across More Than Just the Market Building a resilient portfolio means thinking beyond a single asset or market trend. Economic cycles shift, sectors rise and fall, and no one investment performs well in every environment. That's why many investors look to diversify with platforms that provide access to real estate, fixed-income opportunities, professional financial guidance, precious metals, and even self-directed retirement accounts. By spreading exposure across multiple asset classes, it becomes easier to manage risk, capture steady returns, and create long-term wealth that isn't tied to the fortunes of just one company or industry.
Arrived Homes Backed by Jeff Bezos, Arrived Homes makes real estate investing accessible with a low barrier to entry. Investors can buy fractional shares of single-family rentals and vacation homes starting with as little as $100. This allows everyday investors to diversify into real estate, collect rental income, and build long-term wealth without needing to manage properties directly.
Worthy Bonds For those seeking fixed-income style returns without Wall Street complexity, Worthy Bonds offers SEC-qualified, interest-bearing bonds starting at just $10. Investors earn a fixed 7% annual return, with funds deployed to small U.S. businesses. The bonds are fully liquid, meaning you can cash out anytime, making them attractive for conservative investors looking for steady, passive income.
IRA Financial Self-directed investors looking to take greater control of their retirement savings may consider IRA Financial. The platform enables you to use a self-directed IRA or Solo 401(k) to invest in alternative assets such as real estate, private equity, or even crypto. This flexibility empowers retirement savers to go beyond traditional stocks and bonds, building diversified portfolios that align with their long-term wealth strategies.
Range Wealth Management Range Wealth Management takes a modern, subscription-based approach to financial planning. Instead of charging asset-based fees, the platform offers flat-fee tiers that provide unlimited access to fiduciary advisors along with AI-powered planning tools. Investors can link their accounts without moving assets, while higher-level plans unlock advanced support for taxes, real estate, and multi-generational wealth strategies. This model makes Range especially appealing to high-earning professionals who want holistic advice and predictable pricing.
American Hartford Gold For investors concerned about inflation or seeking portfolio protection, American Hartford Gold provides a simple way to buy and hold physical gold and silver within an IRA or direct delivery. With a minimum investment of $10,000, the platform caters to those looking to preserve wealth through precious metals while maintaining the option to diversify retirement accounts. It's a favored choice for conservative investors who want tangible assets that historically hold value during uncertain markets.
