Young people worst hit by Reeves’s jobs squeeze
Chris Price
Tue, Sep 16, 2025, 1:28 PM 28 min read
Wages grew at their slowest pace in three years, according to the ONS - Jason Alden/Bloomberg
Young people have been the worst hit by jobs cuts following Rachel Reeves’s record-breaking tax raid last autumn. According to the latest official figures, there were 51,000 fewer under-25s in payrolled work in August compared to April. The sharp fall in under-25s in payrolled work comes after the rise in employers’ National Insurance Contributions (NICS) came into force in April, pushing up labour costs.
The figures also reveal that the number of under-30s on out-of-work benefits had risen by 66,000 since the General Election. The decline in the number of workers comes as businesses across the UK cut employees and reduce recruitment following the rise in worker costs. Ben Gregg, a senior researcher at the Centre for Social Justice, said: “Young people are facing a toxic cocktail of rising employment costs and an influx of lower skilled migration into entry-level jobs. Many are turning to a life on mental health benefits as a result. “The Government’s vow to get young people off benefits and into work is welcome, but these figures show how urgently they need to turn words into action.” Economists sounded the alarm on the jobs market on Tuesday after wage growth, staff numbers and vacancies all declined in the latest official figures.
In August, the number of people on payrolls declined for the ninth month out of 10 since Rachel Reeves raised taxes by £40bn in her Budget last year, official figures showed. The Office for National Statistic (ONS) said the number of payrolled staff declined by another 8,000 people in August to 30.3m. Payroll employment is now thought to have fallen by 153,000 since October last year. ICAEW economics director Suren Thiru said: “These figures suggest that the UK’s jobs market is wilting under the weight of a stagnating economy and skyrocketing staffing costs as more businesses look to shrink their workforce in response to these twin headwinds.” The number of job vacancies in the economy has fallen from a peak of 1.3 million in the hiring boom of 2022 to 728,000 in the three months to August, according to the ONS. It marks the 38th month in a row that vacancies have declined.
Average regular earnings excluding bonuses rose by 4.8pc in July, which was the weakest pace since June 2022. Economists expect the Chancellor will have to raise taxes in her Budget on November 26 as she seeks to fill another black hole in the public finances. It is also expected that the figures will force the Bank of England to keep interest rates on hold again this year. Thomas Pugh, chief economist at RSM UK, said: “With pay growth only slowing gradually, another rate cut on Thursday seems out of the question and further rate cuts this year look doubtful.”
Story Continues
Ms Reeves announced increases to employer NICS alongside an increase in the minimum wage as part of £40bn of tax rises during last year’s Budget, which employers said had hit them hard.

Economists sound alarm on jobs market Economists have sounded the alarm on the jobs market after wage growth, staff numbers and vacancies all declined in the latest official figures. Average regular earnings excluding bonuses rose by 4.8pc in July, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), which was the weakest pace since June 2022.
ICAEW economics director Suren Thiru said: “These figures suggest that the UK’s jobs market is wilting under the weight of a stagnating economy and skyrocketing staffing costs as more businesses look to shrink their workforce in response to these twin headwinds.” Ashley Webb of Capital Economics said the data “suggests the labour market continues to loosen”. Economists expect the Chancellor will have to raise taxes in her Budget on November 26 as she seeks to fill another black hole in the public finances. It is also expected that the figures will mean the Bank of England will not cut interest rates again this year. Thomas Pugh, chief economist at RSM UK, said: “With pay growth only slowing gradually, another rate cut on Thursday seems out of the question and further rate cuts this year look doubtful.”
Jim Ratcliffe’s chemicals empire suffers debt downgrade

Billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe is facing higher borrowing costs at his Ineos empire after the group’s credit score was cut for the second time in two years. Fitch, the ratings agency, on Tuesday downgraded the creditworthiness of Sir Jim’s company amid concerns about its soaring debt levels and weakness in the global chemicals market. The downgrade to Fitch’s BB- rating marks the second time Ineos has seen its credit rating cut after it was lowered to BB in January 2024.
Trump open to ‘helping’ UK on trade deal Sir Keir Starmer may gain some comfort from Donald Trump following the blow dealt from figures showing Britain’s weakening jobs market. Donald Trump said he is “into helping” the UK on fine-tuning the UK-US trade deal, as the Government seeks to eliminate the tariffs on British steel imports to the US.
Speaking to reporters before his unprecedented second state visit, the US president said: “Basically, I’m there also on trade. They want to see if they can refine the trade deal a little bit. “We’ve made a deal, and it’s a great deal, and I’m into helping them. “Our country is doing very well. We’ve never done this well. We’re having trillions of dollars come in because of the tariffs. “They’d like to see if they could get a little bit better deal. So, we’ll talk to them.”

Young people hit with ‘toxic cocktail’ in jobs market Young people have been hit with a “toxic cocktail” of rising employment costs and low-skilled immigration as they struggle to land a job, a think tank has warned. Staff payrolls plunged by 58,000 since April as companies have been stung by Rachel Reeves’s tax hikes, data from HMRC showed. Young people have been the worst affected, with 51,000 fewer under 25s in payrolled work in August compared to April, when the Chancellor’s increases to employer National Insurance contributions and the national minimum wage came into effect.
Overall, company payrolls have shrunk by 150,000 since Labour took office in July last year as employers absorbed higher taxes. Ben Gregg of the Centre for Social Justice said: “Young people are facing a toxic cocktail of rising employment costs and an influx of lower skilled migration into entry-level jobs. “Many are turning to a life on mental health benefits as a result. “The Government’s vow to get young people off benefits and into work is welcome, but these figures show how urgently they need to turn words into action.”
US stocks open higher amid rate cut hopes Wall Street’s main indexes opened higher as investors priced in interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve on Wednesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 36.1 points, or 0.1pc, at the open to 45,919.54. The S&P 500 rose 8.9 points, or 0.1pc, to 6,624.13&ZeroWidthSpace;, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 48.7 points, or 0.2pc, to 22,397.58.
Pound pushes higher ahead of interest rate decisions The pound has continued its push higher as the latest employment figures raised expectations that the Bank of England will not cut interest rates again this year. Sterling was up 0.3pc to a two-month higher of $1.364 as the dollar was also weakened by expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates for the first time this year on Wednesday.
Donald Trump called on Fed chairman Jerome Powell to enact a “bigger” cut than the quarter point reduction predicted by money markets. Mohit Kumar, economist at Jefferies, said: “Focus remains on the Fed meeting on Wednesday. Key would be Powell’s tone. “If Powell puts more emphasis on inflation risks or the uncertainty surrounding the growth and inflation outlook, we could see the market paring back some of the rate cut expectations.” The pound was down against the euro by 0.1pc to €1.155 after official data showed eurozone industrial production inched higher in July.
Labour’s thrashing of the jobs market makes welfare cuts more difficult b'
' Sir Keir Starmer, Kemi Badenoch and Nigel Farage all have one thing in common: a desire to enact sweeping welfare cuts. They also appear to agree out of self-preservation that Britain’s growing group of pensioners and their costly triple lock state pensions are off limits, though Farage is yet to make his position clear.
It is unfortunate, of course, that there is no ring-fenced pot of state pension cash to draw upon, but merely younger taxpayers’ increasingly burdened shoulders. With the biggest group of welfare recipients thus off-limits, and the tax burden already racing towards a peacetime high, cuts must fall on the young and middle-aged.
US stocks poised to rise amid hopes of rate cut While declining hopes of rate cuts are holding back UK stocks, things are different over on Wall Street. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq nudged higher in premarket trading after both indexes closed at record highs on Monday. Investors expect the US Federal Reserve to announce the first interest rate cut this year on Wednesday.
Traders have largely priced in a quarter point cut from the US central bank at the conclusion of its two-day meeting, in an attempt to offset the deterioration in the jobs market in the world’s largest economy. Rate cut expectations remained unchanged after the US Senate confirmed economic adviser Stephen Miran to the Fed Board and an appeals court rejected Donald Trump’s bid to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook. In premarket trading, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 were up around 0.2pc while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat.
Sky to cut 600 jobs as it focusses on streaming Sky is planning to cut around 600 jobs in the UK as it slims down its technology team following the launch of new streaming platforms. The media giant has launched a consultation on changes affecting some 900 employees. Around two thirds of those are expected to lose their jobs as a result, with staff working at sites in Leeds, Livingston and Osterley set to be affected.
Sky’s plans to simplify its technology and wider teams come after a significant period of investment in its TV platforms, broadband services and mobile infrastructure. The company now wants to focus on running its existing services. A spokeswoman for Sky said: “Over the past few years, Sky has launched a set of market-leading products including Sky Glass, Sky Stream and our full fibre broadband service. “These products are now firmly established and used by millions of customers, strengthening Sky’s reputation for innovation and great service. “As we look ahead, we are shifting our approach to bring customers the next generation of experience by investing in digital-first service, unbeatable content, and even better performance from our products, powered by the best of global innovation.”

Jobs hoarding ‘likely complete’, says Deutsche Bank Britons face an easier path to find work in the future as “jobs hoarding in the labour market is likely complete”, according to Deutsche Bank. The bank’s chief UK economist Sanjay Raja said the labour market data “will assuage fears of a further ratcheting up in the unemployment rate and should confirm that the worst is likely behind us”.
He said a slowdown in private sector regular pay to 4.7pc was “good news for the Bank of England”, adding that wage growth is “trending slowly but surely towards more target-consistent levels”. He said: “To be sure, there is still slack in the labour market, as evidenced by the rise in claimant account, slight increase in the level of unemployed, the increase in marginal workers looking for work, increase in redundancies, and the (small) fall in payrolls. “Survey data too paint a gloomier picture with hiring intentions still very subdued. Higher labour costs plus budget uncertainty, we think, will keep firms’ hiring plans relatively muted over the next few months.” He added: “The silver lining? The pace of slack is slowing. We are seeing more signs of stabilisation in the harder data as opposed to the soft data.
“The big unwind of jobs hoarding in the labour market is likely complete. Equally, with recruitment difficulties remaining tepid, pay settlements will likely continue edging lower over the course of the year. This should give some comfort that the path ahead may be less bumpy than perhaps some of the survey data suggests.”
Workers’ rights law shows business ‘being ignored’ Demand for new staff is weakening in the jobs market, the Institute of Directors has warned as it took aim at the Government’s flagship employment reforms. Principal policy advisor for employment Alex Hall-Chen said the Employment Rights Bill, which has received praise from trade unions but is opposed by business groups, was a “signal to businesses that their concerns are being ignored”.
She said: “Today’s data reflects a further weakening in employer demand for labour, with vacancies falling by 1.4pc over the quarter and a small decrease in payrolled employees on the month. “A perfect storm of government policies via the Employment Rights Bill, above-inflation increases to the National living Wage, and the increase in Employer National Insurance Contributions have significantly weakened the business case for hiring staff. “An IoD survey of over 600 business leaders last month found employment regulation is the biggest regulatory blocker to business growth in the UK, with 45pc citing it as a barrier to their company growing. At the same time, six in 10 cited employment taxes as negatively affecting their organisation. “The Government’s refusal to engage with sensible amendments made to the Employment Rights Bill in the House of Lords is sending a clear signal to businesses that their concerns are being ignored. “With the return of the Employment Rights Bill to the Commons, we urge government to engage meaningfully with business to address its key concerns and restore business confidence in hiring.”
UK stocks slip as jobs pain worsens The FTSE 100 declined after official figures showed a weakening in the UK jobs market. The UK’s flagship stock index was down 0.3pc, while the mid-cap FTSE 250 was flat. The biggest faller on the FTSE 100 was Haleon, which dropped 3.1pc after its stock was downgraded by Barclays. Trustpilot boosted the FTSE 250 as it climbed 8.5pc following the announcement of a share buyback.
Britain ‘risks 1980s-style unemployment crisis’ under Labour b'
' Britain risks a 1980s-style employment meltdown under Labour as rising taxes crush jobs, one of the nation’s leading recruiters has warned. James Reed, founder of recruitment group Reed, said that never in his entire career had he seen such a sustained fall in hiring. “Official figures show we have now had declining vacancies in the economy for three years – something I have never seen in my 49-year career,” said the chairman and chief executive.
“I am concerned that what we are seeing is partly structural, and that we may be facing a hollowing out of jobs in the same way that we did in the 1980s, except for white-collar rather than blue-collar workers.” The number of job vacancies in the economy has fallen from a peak of 1.3 million in the hiring boom of 2022 to to 728,000 in the three months to August, according to the Office for National Statistics. Excluding the depths of the Covid lockdown, that represents the lowest number of available jobs in more than a decade. Mr Reed said he had witnessed a sharp decline in hiring in the accounting and legal industries, as well as for IT jobs. Vacancies for graduate roles are down by two-thirds since 2022, he said, while hiring is stronger in the health and care sectors, as well as hospitality – roles which are harder to automate with artificial intelligence (AI).
“It will have a big impact on what you might call the graduate class, people who would typically go to university and expect to get a job in some of those areas that are being affected,” said the recruitment boss, warning of a “severe jobs drought”. “That raises a lot of questions around what work people will do in future and what opportunities will be available to young people especially.”
Next rate cut ‘probably in February’ The Bank of England will likely next cut interest rates in February, an economist has said, as wages growth slows down gradually. Thomas Pugh, chief economist at RSM UK said the jobs market “appears to be stabilising after the tax shock in April” after regular pay grew by 4.8pc in July. He said: “With pay growth only slowing gradually, another rate cut on Thursday seems out of the question and further rate cuts this year look doubtful. “The next rate cut will probably come in February once inflation is back on a downward trajectory.” The Bank of England announces its next decision on interest rates on Thursday.
State pension poised to jump by £560 b'
' The state pension is poised to increase by £560 next year, piling more pressure on Rachel Reeves as she seeks to balance the books. The proposed uplift means that payments to retirees are on track to rise by 4.7pc to around £12,536 from April, according to the latest data from the Office for National Statistics. That represents an increase to £241 per week for the full new state pension, up from £230.25.
Workers cling to their jobs as ‘great resignation’ goes into reverse Fresh rounds of lay-offs, concerns about artificial intelligence replacing roles and climbing unemployment are all painting a gloomy picture for any would-be jobseekers. As the outlook for the UK economy and the labour market grows increasingly dreary, many employees are now keeping a close hold of their current roles in what has been described as “the great stay”. Even disgruntled staff members who were previously considering a job move are now holding back from searching for new roles amid fears they could be axed in the next round of redundancies.
Pound rises as rate cuts ruled out The value of the pound has climbed to a two-month high after an interest rate cut this week was effectively ruled out by traders. Sterling was up 0.2pc against the dollar to $1.363 as money markets indicated there is less than 1pc chance of the Bank of England lowering borrowing costs on Thursday. It came after wage growth slowed to a three-year low of 4.8pc in July, according to the ONS, which means it remains well above the rate of inflation, which stood at 3.8pc during the same month.
Meanwhile, traders are also predicting the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in the US on Wednesday for the first time this year. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: “The signs of cooling in the labour market continue to proliferate, putting more pressure on the Bank of England and the Government to step up and take action. “The news hasn’t stopped the pound from hitting a new two-month high against the dollar, but this more due to the weakness of the latter ahead of tomorrow’s near-certain rate cut from the Fed.”
Retail jobs plunge to record low after Reeves tax raid The number of jobs in the retail sector plunged to a record low in the wake of Rachel Reeves’s tax raid. There were 2.78m jobs in retail in June after smoothing out seasonal variations, according to the ONS, down by 97,000 on the same point last year, and 393,000 fewer than in 2015. It comes after the sector was hit hard by the Chancellor’s Budget last year, when she announced increases to employer National Insurance contributions alongside an increase in the minimum wage.
Helen Dickinson, chief executive at the British Retail Consortium, said the measures had cost the industry £5bn this year and were “hitting retail employment hard”. She said: “And worse could be yet to come, with the Employment Rights Bill having a ‘materially negative impact on employment’ according to the OBR, and the threat of further cost rises at the Autumn Budget looming large. “As costs mount on the industry, retail jobs are falling by the wayside. Whether it is the additional complexity wrought by the Employment Rights Bill, or a new surtax on large retail premises, the impact of these policies will be to drive up prices and hold back retail employment. “It vital that the Chancellor’s Autumn Budget does not increase costs to the high street further, or else it will be working people who will pay the price as local, flexible jobs are lost, and the cost of living continues to rise.”
Borrowing costs rise as public sector wages outstrip private The cost of government borrowing edged higher after official figures showed a weakening of Britain’s jobs market. The yield on 10-year UK gilts – a benchmark for the cost of servicing the national debt – rose by one basis point to 4.64pc in early trading. The rise came despite declines in sovereign debt yields among the rest of the G7 in anticipation of a cut to interest rates by the US Federal Reserve, expected on Wednesday.
Commentators pointed to the expansion of public sector employment as further reason for bond investors to be wary about the UK. Annual average total earnings growth in the public sector edged lower to 5.1pc in the three months to July, but still far outstripped the private sector growth of 4.6pc. In June, ONS figures showed public sector employment was at its highest level since September 2011.

Bank of England expected to hold interest rates steady The Bank of England is expected to keep interest rates on hold later this week despite the latest weakening in Britain’s jobs market. Traders are betting there is less than a 1pc chance that policymakers will lower borrowing costs at the next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) on Thursday.
Matt Swannell, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said the Bank of England was likely to continue prioritising the need to get “on top of inflation and less on protecting the jobs market”. The consumer prices index rose to 3.8pc in July, with the figures for August due to be released tomorrow. Mr Swannell said: “There are few signs that inflationary pressures have eased, as businesses continue to pass on the rise in National Insurance contributions (Nics), and while the Monetary Policy Committee’s focus will now turn to the prices data, there are few signs that the jobs market is in need of immediate support.” Rob Wood, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, added that the “stabilising labour market will keep the MPC on hold for the rest of the year”.
Opportunity is shrinking under Labour, say Tories Helen Whately, shadow work and pensions secretary, said: “Today’s figures confirm what the country already knows – under this Labour Government, opportunity is shrinking, and the economy is paying the price.” She added: “In just over a year, Labour has overseen decline in our economy, deterioration in our public services, and a collapse in trust.
“And now, with families already struggling, the country is braced for Rachel Reeves’ impending tax rises, making it even harder for people to get by and for businesses to employ.” Shadow business secretary Andrew Griffith warned the unemployment figure, which remained at a four year high of 4.7pc, had become a “the canary in the mine”:
Signs of progress in jobs data, insists minister Work and Pensions Secretary Pat McFadden said there were bright spots in the latest jobs market data. He said: “Today’s figures show signs of progress with economic inactivity and redundancies continuing to fall. “But we must futureproof our workforce by giving people the opportunities and skills they need to secure the jobs of tomorrow.
“It is vital that our £240m Get Britain Working plan is felt by people across the country, whether it’s through targeted support for young people entering the workforce, or joining up work, health and skills support. “The true strength of the UK’s economy lies in the British people, which is why we are unlocking opportunity in every part of the country to drive forward economic growth under our plan for change.”
UK stocks mixed as jobs market slows The FTSE 100 opened lower after the latest official figures showed a decline in wage growth, payroll numbers and job vacancies in Britain. The UK’s flagship stock index slipped 0.1pc to 9,271.66 at the open. However, the mid-cap FTSE 250 rose by 0.2pc to 21,687.22.
Job vacancies decline for 38th straight month The number of job vacancies in Britain dropped for the 38th month in a row, the ONS said, just as payroll numbers and wage growth also declined. The estimated number of vacancies in the UK fell by 10,000 on the quarter to 728,000 in the three months to August. ICAEW economics director Suren Thiru said: “These figures suggest that the UK’s jobs market is wilting under the weight of a stagnating economy and skyrocketing staffing costs as more businesses look to shrink their workforce in response to these twin headwinds.
“While the pace at which pay growth is slowing remains painfully pedestrian, its current downward trajectory should gather momentum over the autumn as the eyewatering financial squeeze on businesses takes its toll on pay awards. “The UK’s labour market is likely to encounter more adverse turbulence in the coming months as surging costs for businesses and weaker customer demand amid a slowing economy could mean the unemployment rate soon tops 5pc. “An interest rate cut on Thursday remains a non-starter as the speed at which the labour market is loosening at present won’t be enough to trigger another policy loosening, given growing anxiety over increasing inflation.”
Payroll numbers drop heavily since Budget The number of people on payrolls has declined for the ninth month out of 10 since Rachel Reeves raised taxes by £40bn in her Budget last year. The ONS said the number of payrolled staff declined by another 8,000 people in August to 30.3m. Payroll employment is now thought to have fallen by 153,000 since October last year.
Ashley Webb of Capital Economics said the data “suggests the labour market continues to loosen”. However, he warned that the Bank of England would likely keep interest rates at 4pc for the rest of the year as wage growth remained above the rate of inflation. He said: “Overall, with households’ inflation expectations at a six-year high in August, the stubbornness of wage growth will do little to ease the Bank’s concerns about the upside risks to inflation.”
Real wages grow at slower pace Wages are still outstripping inflation but at a slower pace, the latest data from the ONS show. Real earnings growth – which takes into account the impact of inflation – eased back to 1.2pc, which is the lowest point since September 2023.
Falling staff numbers show ‘weakness’ in jobs market Britain’s jobs market is showing signs of weakness, according to the ONS. Director of economic statistics Liz McKeown said: “The labour market continues to cool, with the number of people on payroll falling again, while firms also told us there were fewer jobs in the latest period. “This weakness is reflected in a slight increase on the quarter in the unemployment rate. The number of vacancies also fell on the quarter, though the rate of decline appears to be slowing. “Wage growth excluding bonuses edged down further in cash terms, though it remains strong by historic standards.”
Good morning Thanks for joining me. Wages grew at their slowest pace in three years, official figures show, as Rachel Reeves prepares to hit the economy with more tax rises.
