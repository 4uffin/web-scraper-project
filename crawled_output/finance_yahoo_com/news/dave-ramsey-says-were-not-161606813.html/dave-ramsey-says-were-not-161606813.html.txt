Dave Ramsey Says 'We're Not All Equal. It Doesn't Work That Way' — The Rich Aren't Evil, It's Just Math and Jealousy Fueling the Stigma

If you've ever scrolled social media lately, you've probably seen the sentiment: "landlords are evil." Rising rents, housing shortages, and inflation have created a storm of frustration. But are landlords truly villains—or is it more complicated?

That was the question put to personal finance guru Dave Ramsey when he joined the "Iced Coffee Hour" podcast, hosted by Graham Stephan and Jack Selby. Last month, a clip from the full interview was posted on YouTube under the title "How to Get Rich in Real Estate, the Right Way with Dave Ramsey." Ramsey, who is well-known for his debt-free philosophy and his massive real estate portfolio (all paid for in cash), didn't hold back when addressing the growing stigma around being a landlord. "We're not all equal. It doesn't work that way." When Stephan asked about the narrative that owning property and charging rent is immoral, Ramsey got straight to the point: "When people are hurting and they're scared, socialism gets invogue," Ramsey said. "Australians call it tall poppy syndrome... anybody that makes money must be destroyed. Anybody that's successful must be destroyed so that we're all equal. And as we have figured out, we are not all equal. It doesn't work that way."
Don’t Miss:
If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?
Warren Buffett once said, "If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die." Here’s how you can earn passive income with just $100.
He illustrated the point with humor: "It turns out Brad Paisley is better at playing a guitar than I am. And my friend Brad Thor sells 15 million books on spies, which pisses me off, but he's better at that than I am. We're not all equal. But I don't think Brad should be destroyed because he sold more books than I did." Ramsey argued that resentment against landlords really boils down to what he called the two deadly sins fueling the conversation: envy and jealousy.
"Jealousy is I want what you have. Envy is I don't think you should have it," he explained. "And this is envy. You should be—it should be taken away from you because you bought a house and charged rent." Charging Rent: A Transaction, Not Evil One of the most striking moments came when Ramsey pushed back on the idea that charging market rent is un-Christian or predatory. "Of course, we raise rents. You know, we charge market rent. That's not evil. You're not evil. You're providing a house and you don't have to live there," he said. "Well, where are your people going to live that can't afford it? Somewhere else. If you make $45,000 a year, you cannot live in Manhattan. Hello. Welcome to life."
Story Continues
For Ramsey, it comes down to numbers, not morality: "It's not evil. It's just math. Math is not evil. Nobody's out to hurt you. You don't get a pass on math because you got your little butt hurt feelings." Graham Stephan's Landlord Regret Even Stephan, who has built his career investing in real estate, admitted he once made a big mistake as a landlord. He shared that he kept one tenant's rent flat for 10 years because she was reliable and treated the property well. But in hindsight, he regretted it: "I should have raised the rent. It was a huge mistake that I made looking back," Stephan admitted.
Ramsey agreed, noting that failing to adjust rents can even create confusion over who really owns the property. That's why his own team has a system: "We go up every year. Twenty-five dollars, I don't know, but we go up every year," Ramsey said. "This is a transaction. You're not entitled to cheaper rent because you've been here a long time." At the same time, Ramsey stressed that generosity can and should be part of the equation when circumstances call for it. He recalled waiving rent for a tenant going through cancer treatments and giving a nonprofit daycare six months free rent after buying a building in foreclosure. But, he clarified, those were acts of kindness—not proof that charging rent is inherently bad. Passive Real Estate Income Without the Landlord Headaches The takeaway? Being a landlord isn't evil—it's a business. But as Stephan's regret shows, managing tenants, raising rent, and facing criticism can get messy. Arrived lets everyday investors buy fractional shares of rental properties, giving them the ability to earn passive rental income without the stress of managing tenants, fixing toilets, or agonizing over whether to raise rent $25 a year.
With Arrived, you still get the upside of real estate investing—the cash flow, the appreciation, the diversification—but none of the stigma or late-night phone calls. Dave Ramsey's blunt take on the landlord debate cuts through the noise: charging rent isn't evil, it's math. The resentment around real estate ownership is often more about envy than economics. ee Next:
This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, with minimum investments as low as $100.

Building Wealth Across More Than Just the Market Building a resilient portfolio means thinking beyond a single asset or market trend. Economic cycles shift, sectors rise and fall, and no one investment performs well in every environment. That's why many investors look to diversify with platforms that provide access to real estate, fixed-income opportunities, professional financial guidance, precious metals, and even self-directed retirement accounts. By spreading exposure across multiple asset classes, it becomes easier to manage risk, capture steady returns, and create long-term wealth that isn't tied to the fortunes of just one company or industry.
Arrived Homes Backed by Jeff Bezos, Arrived Homes makes real estate investing accessible with a low barrier to entry. Investors can buy fractional shares of single-family rentals and vacation homes starting with as little as $100. This allows everyday investors to diversify into real estate, collect rental income, and build long-term wealth without needing to manage properties directly.
Worthy Bonds For those seeking fixed-income style returns without Wall Street complexity, Worthy Bonds offers SEC-qualified, interest-bearing bonds starting at just $10. Investors earn a fixed 7% annual return, with funds deployed to small U.S. businesses. The bonds are fully liquid, meaning you can cash out anytime, making them attractive for conservative investors looking for steady, passive income.
IRA Financial Self-directed investors looking to take greater control of their retirement savings may consider IRA Financial. The platform enables you to use a self-directed IRA or Solo 401(k) to invest in alternative assets such as real estate, private equity, or even crypto. This flexibility empowers retirement savers to go beyond traditional stocks and bonds, building diversified portfolios that align with their long-term wealth strategies.
Range Wealth Management Range Wealth Management takes a modern, subscription-based approach to financial planning. Instead of charging asset-based fees, the platform offers flat-fee tiers that provide unlimited access to fiduciary advisors along with AI-powered planning tools. Investors can link their accounts without moving assets, while higher-level plans unlock advanced support for taxes, real estate, and multi-generational wealth strategies. This model makes Range especially appealing to high-earning professionals who want holistic advice and predictable pricing.
American Hartford Gold For investors concerned about inflation or seeking portfolio protection, American Hartford Gold provides a simple way to buy and hold physical gold and silver within an IRA or direct delivery. With a minimum investment of $10,000, the platform caters to those looking to preserve wealth through precious metals while maintaining the option to diversify retirement accounts. It's a favored choice for conservative investors who want tangible assets that historically hold value during uncertain markets. This article Dave Ramsey Says 'We're Not All Equal.
