Tax firm Andersen reveals over 12% revenue jump in US IPO filing

By Ateev Bhandari and Arasu Kannagi Basil (Reuters) -Andersen Group reported a 12.4% rise in revenue for the first half of 2025, the professional services firm disclosed on Friday in its U.S. initial public offering filing, setting the stage for a rare listing by a consulting firm. New listings have gained traction as buoyant equity markets and robust corporate earnings help investors navigate a persistently uncertain macroeconomic environment.
Crypto custody startup BitGo and corporate travel and expense management firm Navan also filed IPO paperwork on Friday, seeking to go public in New York. Andersen, which confidentially filed for a New York IPO in April, traces its origins to Wealth & Tax Advisory Services, founded in 2002 by 23 former Arthur Andersen partners. Arthur Andersen, once a member of the Big Five accounting firms, collapsed in the aftermath of the Enron scandal, leaving Deloitte, PwC, EY and KPMG as the surviving Big Four. A potential listing by the company would mark a notable emergence from the legacy of Arthur Andersen, positioning it as one of the few publicly traded tax and consulting firms in the United States. "The profile of U.S. IPOs has broadened significantly over the past weeks with strong investor demand for respective deals across sectors," said Kat Liu, vice president at IPO research firm IPOX.
The San Francisco-based company, which rebranded as Andersen in 2014 after acquiring the rights to the name, offers tax, valuation, financial advisory, and related consulting services to individual and commercial clients. The company swung to a loss of $45.4 million on revenue of $384.1 million for the six months ended June 30, compared to a profit of $46.9 million on revenue of $341.6 million in the same period a year earlier. Morgan Stanley and UBS are serving as lead underwriters for the offering. Andersen plans to list on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "ANDG".
