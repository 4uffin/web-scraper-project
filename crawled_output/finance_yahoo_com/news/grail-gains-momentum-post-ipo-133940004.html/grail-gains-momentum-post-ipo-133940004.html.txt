Photo by National Cancer Institute on Unsplash On August 12, 2025, GRAIL, Inc. (NASDAQ:GRAL) reported revenue of $35.5 million for the second quarter, surpassing the previous by 11%. Strong demand for the company’s products was exemplified by solid sales of more than 45,000 Galleri tests during the quarter. Additionally, the partnerships with major health systems such as Rush University System for Health and the positive updates from the PATHFINDER 2 study in cancer detection further enhance the company’s positive outlook.
Subsequently, on August 20, 2025, GRAIL, Inc. (NASDAQ:GRAL)’s President Joshua J. Ofman made a significant sale of 4,202 shares amounting to a total of $134,548. The company’s CFO, Aaron Freidin, also engaged in sales, selling 877 shares in a transaction valued at $28,081. With the top executives’ sales signaling an increase in share value, the company’s growth to date stands tall at 169.02% since its IPO on June 25, 2024. Founded in 2015, GRAIL, Inc. (NASDAQ:GRAL) is a healthcare company with the mission of detecting cancer early. The California-based company uses a blood test, known as Galleri, that uses next-generation sequencing and data science to identify multiple cancer types before symptoms appear. While we acknowledge the potential of GRAL as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk. If you're looking for an extremely undervalued AI stock that also stands to benefit significantly from Trump-era tariffs and the onshoring trend, see our free report on the best short-term AI stock.
