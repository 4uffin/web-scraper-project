A copy of the letter can be downloaded here.  U.S. large-cap growth equities recovered from a sharp sell-off in early April by delivering strong returns in the second quarter.

The portfolio returned 27.7% in the quarter, outperforming the benchmark Russell 1000 Growth Index's 17.8% gain. You can check the fund’s top 5 holdings to know more about its best picks for 2025.
In its second-quarter 2025 investor letter, Sands Capital Select Growth Strategy highlighted stocks such as Carvana Co. (NYSE:CVNA). Headquartered in Tempe, Arizona, Carvana Co.
