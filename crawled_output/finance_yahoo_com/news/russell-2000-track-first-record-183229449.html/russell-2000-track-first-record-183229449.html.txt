Russell 2000 Falls Short of Record After Fed Interest-Rate Cut
Joel Leon
September 17, 2025 4 min read
Pedestrians walk along Wall Street near the New York Stock Exchange.
(Bloomberg) -- After sitting on the sidelines for most of the record-breaking run in US equities, small-capitalization stocks briefly joined in with the festivities and came close to ending a drought that dates back to the pandemic. Most Read from Bloomberg

The Russell 2000 Index rose as much as 2.1% to 2,453.36 on Wednesday, surpassing the all-time closing high for the first time since November 2021, before paring some of the gains and pulling back from that level. The gauge closed up 0.2%. A long-expected interest-rate cut from the Federal Reserve helped propel the Russell 2000 higher, even as the broader market finished the day lower. Fed officials cut their benchmark rate by a quarter percentage point and penciled in two more reductions this year following months of intense pressure from . “A few months ago, small-cap stocks looked dead in the water,” said Irene Tunkel, chief US equity strategist at BCA Research. “Small caps were cheap, unloved, and primed for a rebound. Add expectations of Fed easing, fresh tax breaks from OBBBA, and brighter earnings forecasts, and the rally suddenly had legs.”
A fresh record - albeit brief - caps off a stunning comeback for the Russell 2000, which has gained more than 36% from its trough in April, when expectations of Trump’s America First agenda ushering in a revival in small caps fell flat. The rally coincides with “the risk-on sentiment along with expectations that the Fed will cut interest rates potentially three times this year,” said Doug Beath, global equity strategist at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute.
Jefferies Financial Group Inc. strategist Steven DeSanctis notes that the macroeconomic backdrop is “conducive” for small-cap stocks. Furthermore, second-quarter earnings for the sector outperformed expectations. “Earnings for small-cap companies were quite good in the second quarter, much better than expected, and there is an anticipation by later this year or into next year, small-cap earnings growth is going to exceed that of both large cap and the Magnificent Seven,” said DeSanctis. Earlier: Wall Street Expects Rally in Riskiest Stocks to Last 12 Months Revenues for small caps getting nearer to those of their large-cap peers and aggregate sales being on track to finally surpass their 2022 peaks implies that there is more room to climb, according to Bloomberg Intelligence strategist Michael Casper.
Story Continues
“If Fed rate cuts successfully stimulate the economy, today’s top-line views might prove too low, giving the Russell 2000 a chance to finally outperform,” Casper wrote in a note published on Sept. 11. Rising Expectations The Russell 2000 had come close to ending its record-high drought in late 2024, but pulled back as concerns over tariffs sent the index into a tailspin. Since the last record in November 2021, other indexes have posted dozens of all-time highs, with the S&P 500 Index setting more than 20 this year alone.
Over the past few weeks, strategists have been warming up to small-cap stocks. Goldman Sachs strategists led by David Kostin saw rate cuts and a pickup in corporate earnings broadening out the record-breaking rally to areas such as small caps. Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley’s Michael Wilson noted there was room for a catch up for rate-sensitives sectors like small caps. Bank of America Corp. and UBS Group AG joined the push for small-cap outperformance after dovish comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell at Jackson Hole in August. “I really do think animal spirits have started to pick up,” said DeSanctis, noting the increase in mergers and acquisition activity as the market has moved past some of the tariff issues and deregulation is starting to have an effect. “There’s just been more secondary IPO activity. Overall, capital market activity picking up is a good thing for small caps.”
Growing expectations for an interest-rate cut have helped push the Russell 2000 to the once-elusive record high. With about half the stocks on the index not profitable, a rate cut could give a boost to the highly-leveraged group. “Interest expense takes a significant share of small-cap earnings, and lower short-term rates would help reduce that burden,” said Wells Fargo Investment Institute’s Beath. Despite the potential for reduced interest costs, Beath flags that “lower quality” small caps are the most exposed to frictions from Trump’s tariff agenda as they have thinner margins and less flexible supply chains. Because of that, Beath continues to favor large- and mid-cap stocks in the US and remains unfavorable on small caps. For now, small caps are having their day in the sun, but there are questions over how long the outperformance can last. Goldman’s Kostin said there is still scope for small caps to fare better in the near term, though he doesn’t expect that to continue over the next 12 months. For Tunkel, the valuations still look attractive, though headwinds are “impossible to ignore.”
“The bottom line: the rebound has been impressive, but many smaller companies face rising costs and shrinking margins, making this rally fragile,” said Tunkel. (Updates prices throughout.) Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek
