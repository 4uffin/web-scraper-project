Cracker Barrel (CBRL) stock continued to fall on Thursday after investors were disappointed by the restaurant chain's full-year outlook, which projected a drop in traffic and lower sales in the coming year. The downbeat forecast comes after the company rolled back its logo revamp and plans to remake stores after a public outcry that eventually drew the attention of President Trump last month. Its stock is now down nearly 2%, having slid as much as 10% late Wednesday after Cracker Barrel's results report.
Cracker Barrel said on Wednesday that total revenue for its fiscal year 2026, which began on Aug. 2, will fall between $3.35 billion and $3.45 billion, with traffic expected to fall 4%-7% from the previous year. Wall Street expected revenue to come in closer to $3.52 billion for the year. CFO Craig Pommells told investors on Cracker Barrel's earnings call that while traffic had been down 1% in the first half of August, traffic declined approximately 8% since the logo change landed on Aug. 19. "Assuming similar trends continue for the remainder of the quarter, we anticipate a Q1 traffic decline of approximately 7% to 8%," he cautioned.
The company also pulled its outlook for its fiscal year 2027, for which it previously targeted revenue of $3.8 billion-$3.9 billion. In its fourth quarter, Cracker Barrel reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.74, a bit shy of the $0.76 that was expected, on revenue of $868 million, which came in above forecasts. Same-store restaurant sales rose 5.4%, ahead of the 3.5% expected by analysts. For its just-completed fiscal year, the company reported revenue of $3.48 billion, up less than 1% from a year ago. "We thank our guests for sharing their voices and love for the brand and telling us when we've misstepped," CEO Julie Masino said on the call. "Our team pivoted quickly to switch back to our old-timer logo and has already begun executing new marketing, advertising, and social media initiatives, leaning into Uncle Herschel and the nostalgia around the brand with more to come," she added.

In its upcoming fiscal year, Cracker Barrel expects capital expenditures will drop to a range of $135 million-$150 million, as the company is now forecasting no spending on remodeling stores. It plans to open two new Cracker Barrel stores in the year ahead. Masino also said the company is "reverting the four locations with the modern design to our old-timer signage and more traditional interiors." "We're moving ahead with a strong plan to regain traffic and the momentum we had a month ago. There is a lot to be optimistic about," she concluded.

Ahead of the results, the stock was down roughly 6% year to date compared to the S&P 500's (^GSPC) 12% gain. The company is also expecting adjusted EBITDA to take a hit in 2026, forecasting a range of $150 million-$190 million after reporting adjusted EBITDA of $224.3 million for its fiscal 2025. Commodity inflation is expected to come in between 2.5% and 3.5% in the year ahead, considering hourly wage inflation of 3%-4%, elevated beef and pork prices, and cheaper poultry and produce.
