From stealth mode to center stage, Mach Industries is bringing AI into one of the world’s most complex and controversial sectors: defense. At TechCrunch Disrupt 2025, Ethan Thornton, CEO and founder of Mach Industries, steps onto the AI Stage to share what it takes to build in high-stakes environments where speed and autonomy matter most — and why next-gen infrastructure starts with rethinking the fundamentals.
TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 Ethan Thornton
Inside the AI arms race — and the founder aiming to rewrite it Thornton launched Mach Industries out of MIT in 2023 with a bold mission: to build decentralized, next-generation defense technologies that safeguard freedom on a global scale. Now leading one of the most ambitious startups in the space, he’s bringing startup speed and AI-native innovation to an industry long dominated by legacy players.
From startup lab to battlefield impact Mach Industries is part of a new wave proving that AI startups can play a critical role in national defense. This session will unpack what that means — from autonomous systems and edge computing to dual-use technologies that blur the lines between commercial and military capability. Thornton will dig into funding, regulation, and responsibility at the intersection of tech and geopolitics.
