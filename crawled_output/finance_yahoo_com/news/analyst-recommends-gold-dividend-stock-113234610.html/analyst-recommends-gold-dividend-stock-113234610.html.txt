Analyst Recommends This Gold Dividend Stock That’s Up 90% in 2025

AEM
We recently published These 10 Stocks are Buzzing After Important Analyst Calls. Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (NYSE:AEM) is one of the stocks analysts were recently talking about. Kevin Simpson, Capital Wealth Planning founder and CIO, said in a latest program on CNBC that Agnico Eagle Mines is one of the top gold stocks to buy. The analyst believes the stock has more room to run and highlighted its dividend. AEM is up 96% so far this year. “We look back and we say this is the best year we’ve had since 1979. Gold is up 40% on the year. And I was trying to remember back to 1979. Inflation was running at like 13% back then. Now, it’s less than three. So, where that similarity stops and starts, I’m not exactly sure. Like, Agnico Eagle Mines is an amazing stock. It’s up over a 100% year to date. I think it can continue. Pays only about a 1% dividend, but Frank, for the past 5 years, they’ve been increasing that dividend on an average of 25% per year. Profitable business. Really neat space, and I like the name a lot.”
Analyst Recommends This Gold Dividend Stock That’s Up 90% in 2025
Rewey Asset Management stated the following regarding Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (NYSE:AEM) in its Q1 2025 investor letter: “Eagle Mines Limited (NYSE:AEM) was our strongest percentage gainer in the quarter, although we sold the position to zero, half in late January and the balance in mid-March. AEM is a good example of our philosophy of not selling a stock just because its market cap grows out of our Smid range, as it ended 1Q25 at a $53 bil. market cap. Initially, we acquired Kirkland Lake, which was subsequently acquired by AEM for stock. We held the position, and the combined entity posted strong returns for RAM. We sold our position as it rose to our price target on strong gold pricing, and on our view that the medium-term production plateau forecast by the company would likely leave the company as a just a pure play on gold prices. We continue to own Wesdome Gold Mines (WDOFF) which is forecast to post strong production growth and cost reductions and is located in the same Abitibi gold belt sweet spot as AEM’s core operations.”
While we acknowledge the potential of AEM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk. If you are looking for an extremely cheap AI stock that is also a major beneficiary of Trump tariffs and onshoring, see our free report on the best short-term AI stock.
