ACRS
Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:ACRS) is among the best fundamentally strong penny stocks to buy right now. According to the recent Form 13F filing with the SEC, Acadian Asset Management LLC expanded its holdings in Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:ACRS) by 25.9% in the first quarter. With the purchase of 451,044 shares, the investment manager now owns 2,195,191 shares of the company’s stock, representing an ownership stake of 2.03%.
Despite the company’s history of failures, Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:ACRS) appears to be on the right track for future success. Just recently, the company announced that new data from its Phase 2a trial of ATI-2138 for atopic dermatitis will be highlighted as a late-breaking abstract at the 2025 EADV Congress in Paris.
ATI-2138, a leading selective oral covalent inhibitor of ITK and JAK3, serves as a solution for moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. The session, delivered by Dr. Jessica Beaziz-Tordjman, covered the drug’s effectiveness in treating the condition. Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:ACRS) is a Pennsylvania-based clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company that develops novel drug candidates targeting immune-inflammatory diseases. Incorporated in 2012, the company operates through two segments: Therapeutics and Contract Research. While we acknowledge the potential of ACRS as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk. If you're looking for an extremely undervalued AI stock that also stands to benefit significantly from Trump-era tariffs and the onshoring trend, see our free report on the best short-term AI stock.
