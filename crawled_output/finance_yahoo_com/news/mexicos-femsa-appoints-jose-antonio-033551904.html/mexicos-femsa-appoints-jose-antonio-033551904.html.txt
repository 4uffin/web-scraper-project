KO
(Reuters) - Mexican bottler and retailer Femsa on Wednesday appointed Jose Antonio Fernandez Garza-Laguera as the new chief executive officer, starting on November 1. Garza-Laguera, who will replace the interim CEO Antonio Fernandez Carbajal, is currently the CEO of Femsa Proximity & Health and has held several management roles across Femsa's business units. Carbajal has served as the interim CEO since July 2023 and will continue in his role as an executive chairman, the company said. The retailer, which controls one of the largest Coca-Cola bottlers and a network of convenience stores, reported dented second-quarter net profits in July due to adverse weather in its main market, Mexico.
