UK’s Miliband Defends Green-Energy Push After Trump Attack

(Bloomberg) -- UK Energy Secretary Ed Miliband defended Britain’s green-energy push after Donald Trump scolded the country for turning away from North Sea oil and gas in a speech at the United Nations during which he criticized many of America’s closest allies. Trump, who visited the UK for a state visit just last week, denounced Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s attempt to diversify from fossil fuels to renewable energy.

“Both the immigration and their suicidal energy ideas will be the death of Western Europe,” Trump told the UN General Assembly in New York on Tuesday morning, referring to the UK. Miliband later told Bloomberg TV the president’s “opposition to wind power and his enthusiasm for fossil fuels is well known,” saying Trump has a mandate for his policies in the US. “Likewise, we are the duly elected government of the UK and we have a mandate for our mission,” Miliband said, referring to investments in renewables and nuclear power. The government’s policy on the North Sea is to not issue new exploration licenses, while allowing continued exploitation of existing fields.

“It’s all about tackling the climate crisis, yes, but it’s about having secure homegrown energy, renewables, nuclear so we aren’t reliant on petrostates and dictators for our energy,” Miliband said. Though Trump said he respected and liked Starmer “a lot,” he said the government’s stance on climate and immigration was wrong more than once during his roughly hour-long speech. “There’s tremendous oil that hasn’t been found in the North Sea,” Trump said. “They essentially closed it by making it so highly taxed that no developer, no oil company, can go there.”

London’s mayor — he didn’t mention Sadiq Khan by name — was “terrible, terrible,” Trump added, falsely claiming he’s introducing Sharia law to the capital. Khan’s office said the mayor wouldn’t “dignify his appalling and bigoted comments with a response.” On Wednesday, UK cabinet minister Pat McFadden dismissed Trump’s remarks as part of a long running feud between the president and the mayor, telling Times Radio: “the two of them have had a beef for some years.” Trump also slammed Germany over its green-energy policies, as well as Greece and Switzerland for allowing in immigrants. Brazil was cited for, in Trump’s opinion, its censorship and repression.
