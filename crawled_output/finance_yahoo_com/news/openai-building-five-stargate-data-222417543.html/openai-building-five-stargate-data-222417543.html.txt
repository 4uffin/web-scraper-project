OpenAI announced on Tuesday that it plans to build five new AI data centers across the United States with partners Oracle and SoftBank through its Stargate project. The new data centers will bring Stargate’s planned capacity to 7 gigawatts — enough energy to power more than 5 million homes. Three of the new sites are being developed with Oracle. They’re located in Shackelford County, Texas; Doña Ana County, New Mexico; and an undisclosed location in the Midwest. The other two sites are being developed with SoftBank, with one in Lordstown, Ohio, and the other in Milam County, Texas. The new Stargate AI data centers are part of OpenAI’s massive infrastructure buildout, as the company works to train and serve more powerful AI models. On Monday, OpenAI said it would receive a $100 billion investment from Nvidia to buy the chipmaker’s AI processors and build out even more AI data centers.
