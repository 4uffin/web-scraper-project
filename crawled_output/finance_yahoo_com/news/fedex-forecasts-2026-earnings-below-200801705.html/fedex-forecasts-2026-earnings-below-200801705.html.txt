FedEx results top targets on cost-cutting, shares jump

FDX
By Abhinav Parmar and Lisa Baertlein (Reuters) - FedEx (FDX) reported quarterly profit and revenue above Wall Street estimates, as cost-cutting and strength in domestic deliveries helped offset weaker international volumes after the U.S. ended tariff exemptions on low-value, direct-to-consumer shipments.
Shares of Memphis-based FedEx climbed 5% in premarket trading on Friday after surprising Wall Street. Analysts had expected profit per share to fall due to the end of "de minimis" exemptions, which allowed shipments valued under $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free. While total international average daily export volume fell 3%, overall average daily volume including domestic parcels rose 4% for the quarter, and revenue per package increased by 2%. FedEx has been working on slashing billions of dollars in operating costs by parking planes, closing facilities and merging some of its units. It has a $1 billion cost-saving plan for this fiscal year ending in May 2026.
Those efforts helped shelter profits. Closely watched operating margin increased to 6% from 5.2% during the quarter, which saw a 5% jump in domestic average daily delivery volume, fueled by U.S. consumer spending resilience despite worries about inflation and rising joblessness. FedEx reported an adjusted profit of $912 million, or $3.83 per share, for the first quarter ended August 31, up from $892 million, or $3.60 per share a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected a profit of $3.59 per share, according to data compiled by LSEG.
Its quarterly revenue of $22.24 billion also beat analysts' estimate of $21.66 billion. Global tariffs, particularly related to the end of the de minimis exemption for China and Hong Kong, cut first quarter revenue by $150 million. That is expected to repeat every quarter this year, Chief Customer Officer Brie Carere said. Combined with other revenue pressures and expenses, trade policies represent a $1 billion headwind for the year, she said. That "is predominantly an impact of top line revenue reduction, because China to the U.S. is a very profitable lane for us," Carere said. FedEx forecast 2026 earnings per share largely below analysts' estimates. It expects full-year adjusted earnings in the range of $17.20 to $19.00 per share, marginally below analysts' average estimate of $18.21 at the midpoint. The U.S. on May 2 ended the century-old "de minimis" exemptions for packages from China and Hong Kong. Those shipments accounted for about three-quarters of roughly 1.4 billion packages that entered the United States each year under the program.
Story Continues
The U.S. ended exemptions for all other countries on August 29. FedEx said it completed $500 million of share repurchases in the quarter and is on track to spin off its freight segment by June 2026.
