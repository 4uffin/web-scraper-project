iPhone Review: The Superthin Air vs. the iPhone 17 Lineup
Nicole Nguyen
September 17, 2025 6 min read
In this article:
AAPL
I tested four of Apple's latest models, from the iPhone Air (left) to the iPhone 17 Pro Max, which all come with screen durability improvements and increased base storage. - POPPY LYNCH FOR WSJ
Do you prefer style or substance? This iPhone season, it’s all about weighing looks, price and features. The headliner is the iPhone Air, the new uberslim model whose ample screen is sized between the base iPhone and the Pro Max. While it’s a thing of beauty, the Air comes with some real compromises. For those looking for a tool rather than an accessory, the choice is between the iPhone 17 and the 17 Pros.

All of this year’s iPhones, available starting Friday, are more durable and start with a higher base storage of 256 gigabytes, compared with the last generation. I want to focus on two areas where these models differ—areas I care about most: battery life and camera quality. The batteries Each model has more battery life than its predecessor with one exception: the iPhone Air, which replaces the iPhone 16 Plus. The ultrathin phone doesn’t have as much space for a battery. It instantly reminded me of my beloved iPhone 13 Mini—perfect for my small hands, but it couldn’t last through the day without charging. Apple discontinued it a couple of years ago. Apple’s longest battery rating is measured in hours of video playback. While that provides easy-to-compare numbers, it doesn’t reflect real phone use.
The $999-and-up iPhone Air puts a priority on sleekness over battery and camera. - POPPY LYNCH FOR WSJ
Sure, I watch an episode or two of video each day. I also make calls, look up directions, record interviews, read news and scroll through social media. I take lots of photos and videos, too. Everyone interacts with a device differently. My test is intended to show how the models perform relative to each other. Over the past week, I re-created my daily routine from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. on a mix of 5G and Wi-Fi. Here’s what was left in the tank at bedtime:
• iPhone Air: 19% • iPhone 17: 27% • iPhone 17 Pro: 30% • iPhone 17 Pro Max: 54% Although the iPhone Air’s battery depleted the quickest, it wasn’t the letdown I had feared. Meanwhile, the 17 Pro Max could have kept on going for another day. The day I really used up the Air’s juice while camera testing, I tried the new, made-for-Air MagSafe battery pack ($99). The battery went from 8% to 70% in under an hour. But that thin phone got temporarily fat. Keep in mind, I tested with totally fresh batteries. Over time, they’ll degrade in capacity, and could one day need to be replaced.
Story Continues
The cameras
All the new iPhones have an updated 18-megapixel front camera. With a tap, you can switch to a wide shot without rotating the phone. - Poppy Lynch for WSJ
Across the new iPhones, the front camera received a noticeable upgrade. Selfie videos are now stabilized. Even a jog over rocky terrain looked smooth. The 18-megapixel camera takes sharper, higher-resolution selfies. And in a clever new trick, you can switch from portrait to landscape without rotating the phone.
The story is more complicated with the rear cameras. The big question: How many cameras do you need? • iPhone Air On the back, the Air has just one 48-megapixel camera with a 2x “optical-quality” zoom. Basically, if you zoom in, the image is enhanced but it drops in resolution. •• iPhone 17 The basic iPhone 17 has a second 48-megapixel camera with an ultrawide lens. That’s not just for big mountain scenes, it’s also great for squeezing in more of the people right in front of you. While testing the single-camera Air, I really missed this. The ultrawide also enables macro mode for extreme artsy close-ups of flowers, insects and other teeny details.
The iPhone 17 has two 48-megapixel cameras, a standard lens and an ultrawide lens (shown here) for group shots and extreme close-up macros. - Nicole Nguyen/WSJ
••• iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max The Pro models add a third lens, a telephoto (now also 48 megapixels) for true optical zoom up to 4x and “optical-quality” up to 8x. Compared with the non-Pros, I saw the biggest difference with videos—they’re more stable and they sound better. The verdicts Honestly, if your current phone is going strong and compatible with iOS 26, you might not need to upgrade at all. If it needs longer battery life, a battery replacement might be the best move. Analysts are pointing to 2026 as a potentially bigger year of updates, with a foldable iPhone at the high end. We might also finally see promised AI upgrades, such as a smarter Siri—the real change we’re all waiting for. Apple is lagging behind its Android competition on both fronts.
No, you can’t wait? If that’s the case, here’s the current menu, and what to bear in mind: iPhone 16e ($599 and up): This came out in February. It’s the “cheap” iPhone for people who just want the basics. One no-go for me: It doesn’t work with MagSafe magnetic accessories. iPhone 17 ($799 and up): This is the iPhone most people should get. It has the battery and camera boosts noted above. It also has a new Pro-level smooth-refreshing screen that can be both brighter and dimmer than the one on last year’s model. And with the relatively smaller 6.3-inch display, I could still reach the corners of the display with my thumb. iPhone Air ($999 and up): Its polished titanium frame is beautiful. And for a phone with a 6.5-inch screen, it still feels light and manageable in your hand. But it puts a priority on form over function, at a price. The Air is for the die-hard Apple fans who don’t mind a little sacrifice in exchange for something genuinely new.
iPhone 17 Pro ($1,099 and up): The Pros are premium. You get better battery life and that extra zoom. The photos are noticeably nicer, and there are true “pro” features, such as faster media transfers. It’s the same screen size as the iPhone 17, though heftier and heavier. It also comes in Cosmic Orange, which people (including my editor) seem to be excited about.
The Cosmic Orange iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max are…really orange. - Poppy Lynch for WSJ
iPhone 17 Pro Max ($1,199 and up): I never understood the Max until I tested this one. You never have to worry about the battery draining. The 6.9-inch screen—Apple’s biggest—is so nice to look at. I just keep coming up with reasons to pick it up, even though it still doesn’t fit in my hand. So what’ll it be, the sensible basic model, the supercharged workhorse or that sleek fashion statement? That’s your call. Write to Nicole Nguyen at nicole.nguyen@wsj.com Most Read from The Wall Street Journal
