Sphere Entertainment Follows The Yellow Brick Road To $65 Million In Revenue: Will Wizard Of Oz Send Shares Higher?

Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below. The 1939 film "The Wizard of Oz" has new life once again and is helping to boost shares of Sphere Entertainment Co (NYSE:SPHR). Here's a look at the latest figures and why the film could be critical to the Sphere bull thesis.
Follow the Yellow Brick Road To Profits Reports linked Sphere Entertainment with adapting the 1939 Academy Award-winning film for its immersive Las Vegas venue last year. The film opened on Aug. 28, and more than 500,000 tickets have been sold, according to the company.

Sphere said Monday that it has sold $65 million in tickets for the movie through Sept.12. The venue has multiple showings of the film most days, with tickets for the movie tomorrow currently showing a cheapest price of $114 per ticket. This marks the first film adaptation for the entertainment company and, through a partnership with Warner Bros. Discovery (NASDAQ:WBD), which owns the film rights, could be the first of many. Warner Bros. Discovery is collecting a portion of the royalties, according to reports. Sphere launched its original film "Postcard From Earth" from director Darren Aronofsky in 2023. The film has sold over four million tickets as of June, according to the company. Future Growth Ahead This adaptation of a Hollywood film and an iconic movie known to many is likely the start of a multi-year growth plan that could include other adaptations. Sphere has reached out to Warner Bros. about adapting the Harry Potter films and to Disney about adapting several films, including the Star Wars franchise, according to Bloomberg.
The adaptation of "The Wizard of Oz" was a $100 million cost for Sphere, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Future film adaptations would likely cost less due to the technological advancements and immersive elements already established in the current film. See Also: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it? Sphere Entertainment reported $175.6 million in revenue for the second quarter for the Sphere segment, up 16% year-over-year. Operating income improved from a loss of $5.5 million in last year's second quarter to a profit of $24.9 million for the Sphere segment of the company. Adding the movie to the current lineup of events at the venue will likely boost revenue and operating income in the coming quarters.
Story Continues
Since opening, the Sphere venue in Las Vegas has hosted immersive concerts from the likes of Phish, U2, The Eagles, Dead & Company, Kenny Chesney and The Backstreet Boys. The venue has also hosted the NHL Draft, a UFC fight and corporate events. The venue has proven out the economic model of hosting concerts and now has another revenue generator up its sleeve. Fans would likely love to see franchises like Harry Potter and Star Wars adapted.
There is likely a number of bands ready to play the venue and film companies ready to allow their works to hit the giant immersive screens at the venue. Sphere also signed a deal to open another venue in the United Arab Emirates. While Sphere will not operate the venue, it will provide technology and content and likely collect recurring revenue. The deal also includes the option for additional venues in the Middle East. Sphere Stock Soars Higher Sphere shares closed at $59.43 on Tuesday versus a 52-week trading range of $23.89 to $61.28. The stock is up 43.2% year-to-date in 2025. Photo: ByDroneVideos / Shutterstock.com Trending Now:

Building Wealth Across More Than Just the Market Building a resilient portfolio means thinking beyond a single asset or market trend. Economic cycles shift, sectors rise and fall, and no one investment performs well in every environment. That's why many investors look to diversify with platforms that provide access to real estate, fixed-income opportunities, professional financial guidance, precious metals, and even self-directed retirement accounts. By spreading exposure across multiple asset classes, it becomes easier to manage risk, capture steady returns, and create long-term wealth that isn't tied to the fortunes of just one company or industry.
Arrived Homes Backed by Jeff Bezos, Arrived Homes makes real estate investing accessible with a low barrier to entry. Investors can buy fractional shares of single-family rentals and vacation homes starting with as little as $100. This allows everyday investors to diversify into real estate, collect rental income, and build long-term wealth without needing to manage properties directly.
Worthy Bonds For those seeking fixed-income style returns without Wall Street complexity, Worthy Bonds offers SEC-qualified, interest-bearing bonds starting at just $10. Investors earn a fixed 7% annual return, with funds deployed to small U.S. businesses. The bonds are fully liquid, meaning you can cash out anytime, making them attractive for conservative investors looking for steady, passive income.
IRA Financial Self-directed investors looking to take greater control of their retirement savings may consider IRA Financial. The platform enables you to use a self-directed IRA or Solo 401(k) to invest in alternative assets such as real estate, private equity, or even crypto. This flexibility empowers retirement savers to go beyond traditional stocks and bonds, building diversified portfolios that align with their long-term wealth strategies.
Range Wealth Management Range Wealth Management takes a modern, subscription-based approach to financial planning. Instead of charging asset-based fees, the platform offers flat-fee tiers that provide unlimited access to fiduciary advisors along with AI-powered planning tools. Investors can link their accounts without moving assets, while higher-level plans unlock advanced support for taxes, real estate, and multi-generational wealth strategies. This model makes Range especially appealing to high-earning professionals who want holistic advice and predictable pricing.
American Hartford Gold For investors concerned about inflation or seeking portfolio protection, American Hartford Gold provides a simple way to buy and hold physical gold and silver within an IRA or direct delivery. With a minimum investment of $10,000, the platform caters to those looking to preserve wealth through precious metals while maintaining the option to diversify retirement accounts. It's a favored choice for conservative investors who want tangible assets that historically hold value during uncertain markets.
