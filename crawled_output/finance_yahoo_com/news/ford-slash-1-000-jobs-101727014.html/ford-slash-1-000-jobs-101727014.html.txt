Ford to slash 1,000 jobs at Cologne EV plant amid demand slump – report
Ford will adjust its operations to a “single-shift” system from January 2026 · Just Auto
GlobalData
Wed, Sep 17, 2025, 6:17 AM 2 min read
Ford appears set to reduce its workforce at the electric vehicle (EV) production plant in Cologne, Germany, with up to 1,000 jobs facing cuts due to a decline in demand. According to a Reuters report, the US automotive giant will adjust its operations to a “single-shift” system from January 2026, which will lead to job losses.
The company has committed to providing voluntary redundancy packages to the employees impacted at its Cologne EV centre. The development is part of a broader restructuring effort by Ford in Germany, which has already seen significant job impacts, including those at the Cologne location and the planned closure of the Saarlouis facility. Last year, Ford inaugurated the Cologne EV Center to manufacture a new lineup of EVs for Europe. In May 2025, Ford discontinued a project aimed at creating a next-generation electrical architecture, dubbed FNV4, which was expected to enhance software functions across its vehicle range, with the goal of reducing costs and introducing new profitable features. In a similar vein, Bosch is implementing further cost-saving measures.
As reported by Bloomberg, the company’s mobility division is contending with an annual financial gap of about €2.5bn ($2.93bn) due to increased competition and subdued sales. In an emailed statement, Bosch stated: “We will continue and intensify our portfolio and structural adjustments as a result. “This includes cutting costs across the board — from materials and logistics to capital spending and jobs.” Bosch has also said to have begun its own restructuring process within Germany, which involves job reductions and lowering production expenses to maintain profitability amidst a slower uptake of electric and autonomous driving technologies than anticipated. These cost-cutting initiatives underscore the broader challenges faced by Germany's industrial sector, with automotive companies and their suppliers struggling in a static European car market while investing in new technology, the Bloomberg report said.
The report added that major automotive firms, including Porsche and Volkswagen, are also adjusting their workforce and production levels to mitigate the effects of soft sales in key markets such as China and the financial implications of trade tariffs. "Ford to slash 1,000 jobs at Cologne EV plant amid demand slump – report" was originally created and published by Just Auto, a GlobalData owned brand.
