QatarEnergy has signed a contract with Samsung C&T's Engineering & Construction Group to build a solar power plant in Dukhan, Qatar, located roughly 80km west of Doha. The Dukhan plant will be built in two phases, with a total electricity generation capacity of 2,000MW expected by mid-2029. Upon completion, the plant will double Qatar’s solar power generation capacity and support its renewable energy objectives.
During a ceremony at QatarEnergy's headquarters in Doha, the agreement was signed by Saad Sherida Al-Kaabi, the country's energy minister and president and CEO of QatarEnergy, and Sechul Oh, the president and CEO of Samsung C&T. Abdulla bin Ali Al-Theyab, president of KAHRAMAA, also attended the event alongside senior executives from both companies. KAHRAMAA is the sole transmission and distribution system owner and operator in Qatar's electricity and water sector. The first phase of the Dukhan plant is scheduled to supply 1GW of power to the KAHRAMAA grid by the end of 2028. The power facility will feature a solar tracker system and high-temperature inverters to improve efficiency. Al-Kaabi said: “This agreement is an important milestone in our effort to manage the environment in a manner that balances economic and social development with environmental protection, as stipulated by Qatar National Vision 2030. It also supports one of the key goals of QatarEnergy’s Sustainability Strategy, which is to generate more than 4,000MW of renewable energy by 2030.
“When completed, the Dukhan solar power plant, along with Al-Kharsaah, Mesaieed, Ras Laffan solar power plants will help reduce carbon dioxide emissions by about 4.7 million tons annually, while contributing up to 30% of Qatar’s total peak electricity demand. We are pleased to collaborate with Samsung C&T to help achieve this vision.” "QatarEnergy and Samsung sign agreement for Dukhan solar power plant " was originally created and published by Power Technology, a GlobalData owned brand.
