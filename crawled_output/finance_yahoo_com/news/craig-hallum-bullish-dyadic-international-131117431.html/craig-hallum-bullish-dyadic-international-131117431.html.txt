In this article:
DYAI
Dyadic International, Inc. (NASDAQ:DYAI) is among the best fundamentally strong penny stocks to buy right now. Analysts at Craig-Hallum have started coverage on Dyadic International, Inc. (NASDAQ:DYAI) with a ‘Buy’ rating and a price target of $5.00, reflecting an upside potential of nearly 405.7%. The research firm highlights the company’s strategic focus on commercializing its proprietary C1-cell protein production platform and Dapibus platforms following four long years of dedicated research and development.
The company previously focused on utilizing its technology to accelerate vaccine development more quickly and cost-effectively, but it has now transitioned toward commercial applications. The outcome of this step is what the firm calls “already bearing fruit” for Dyadic International, Inc. (NASDAQ:DYAI). What’s even more interesting is that the company could realize $100 million in monetary gains over the next five years.
The management, too, has high hopes for the future. During the latest earnings call, Joseph P. Hazelton, President & COO, highlighted that Dyadic International, Inc. (NASDAQ:DYAI) has reached a commercial inflection point, positioning itself to compete and win in these markets. With its partnerships, we can certainly conclude that while many companies plan big but fail to execute successfully, this one proves otherwise.
Dyadic International, Inc. (NASDAQ:DYAI) is a Florida-based biotechnology platform company that specializes in industrial enzymes and other proteins. Incorporated in 1979, the company is committed to revolutionizing biotechnology. While we acknowledge the potential of DYAI as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk. If you're looking for an extremely undervalued AI stock that also stands to benefit significantly from Trump-era tariffs and the onshoring trend, see our free report on the best short-term AI stock.
