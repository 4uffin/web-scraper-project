The space economy isn’t just about rockets and satellites — it’s about infrastructure, autonomy, and entirely new models for building and defending off-Earth assets. At TechCrunch Disrupt 2025, happening October 27–29 at San Francisco’s Moscone West, the Space Stage is where this shift gets real. If you’re ready to explore how next-gen tech meets the cosmos, grab your ticket before savings of up to $668 end on September 26 at 11:59 p.m. PT.
TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 Evens Rogers Max and Haot
Inside the next era of space tech In this forward-looking panel, Even Rogers, co-founder and CEO of True Anomaly, and Max Haot, serial entrepreneur and founder of Launcher (acquired by Vast) and CEO of Vast, take the stage to explore what’s changing — and what’s needed — to unlock a more sustainable and scalable space economy. Rogers brings deep national security and defense experience from his years as an Air Force officer and space systems strategist, including time as a DARPA Service Chiefs Fellow and contributor to the foundational doctrine of the U.S. Space Force. Now he’s deploying cutting-edge space technologies to protect orbital assets and reimagine how the U.S. ensures freedom of action in space.
Haot, meanwhile, brings the commercial side of the equation. As CEO of Vast, he’s a multi-exit founder with companies spanning aerospace, livestreaming, and connected devices. Most recently, he led Launcher to acquisition by Vast as part of a mission to build artificial gravity space stations — making him a key voice in turning science fiction into capital-backed reality. The future of space isn’t theoretical — it’s operational From new government-commercial partnerships to venture-backed orbital platforms, this session looks at the strategies and tech fueling the next wave of growth. It’s a candid conversation for anyone betting on the intersection of space, innovation, and private enterprise. More space tech leaders will join this panel discussion, so stay tuned for the update. Join the new pioneers on the Space Stage Disrupt 2025 will bring together more than 10,000 founders, investors, and operators. Don’t miss the chance to hear what’s next in space before it makes headlines. Get your pass now to save up to $668 before September 26 and secure your seat at the Space Stage.
