Borderlands Mexico: Uber Freight bets on cross-border growth as trade surges 21%

Borderlands Mexico is a weekly rundown of developments in the world of United States-Mexico cross-border trucking and trade. This week: Uber Freight bets on cross-border growth as trade surges 21%; GE Aerospace to Invest $29M in Mexico Expansion; and Binary Container Logistics expands with major Texas lease.
Uber Freight bets on cross-border growth as trade surges 21% JACKSONVILLE — Uber Freight is deepening its imprint in Mexico, integrating customs, brokerage, and transportation services to help shippers navigate a fast-changing trade environment, according to Jesús Ojeda, the company’s head of Mexico operations. “One of the advantages that we have is we digitalize everything, and we have visibility at the border, which has traditionally been the black hole,” Ojeda said in an interview at Uber Freight’s Deliver 2025 conference on Tuesday. “Customers can see every document, every check, every step in the same system.”
Deliver 2025 was held in Jacksonville, Florida, from Monday through Wednesday. About 200 shippers and industry experts attended keynote addresses, workshops, demos, and networking sessions exploring where the freight industry is headed and how companies can prepare. Join the leaders shaping freight’s future atF3: Future of Freight Festival, Oct 21-22.Network with the industry’s best and discover what’s next. Register now! Ojeda said Uber Freight’s end-to-end approach is resonating with customers across segments — from large enterprises to mid-market and small businesses — as cross-border logistics grows more complex. “Every day there are different requirements in Mexico and the U.S.,” Ojeda said. “As soon as we update our systems, we can react in real time and help customers avoid extra duties or delays.”
Mexico has surged to the top spot as America’s leading trade partner, driving $74.4 billion in cross-border commerce in July alone, according to the Census Bureau. So far this year, U.S.-Mexico trade has jumped 21% to $507 billion, outpacing 2024 levels. Ojeda noted that Mexico’s shifting trade rules — including new tariffs of up to 25% on certain imports — are pushing manufacturers to localize production in Mexico to comply with rules of origin requirements in the United States-Mexico-Canada-Agreement USMCA. “International commerce becomes more complex now because of the USMCA rules of origin,” Ojeda said. “As a broker, but also as trade compliance advisors, we should make sure that the exporters and the importers are in compliance. We review every document in order to confirm that everything is compliant with the regulations. The idea is to treat the shipment as domestic and help the customers to avoid any extra delays at the border because of the situation.”
Story Continues
Despite soft freight rates, Ojeda said logistics investment in Laredo, Texas, remains strong. The port of entry in Laredo was the No. 1-ranked U.S. trade gateway in July, totaling $30.3 billion in two-way commerce, a 7% year-over-year increase, according to WorldCity. Year-to-date, cross-border trade in Laredo has risen 6% to $206 billion.
“Big companies are investing in cross-docks, and multinational logistics firms are expanding in Laredo,” Ojeda said. “Good things are coming there, and from Mexico as well.” With industrial hubs like Monterrey, Mexico, and the country’s Bajío region booming, Ojeda expects Uber Freight’s Mexico operations to continue expanding. He forecasted around 21% growth next year, supported by demand from the automotive sector and rising nearshoring trends “It’s a complex time, but also a good financial year for us,” Ojeda said. “We’re ready.” GE Aerospace to Invest $29M in Mexico Expansion GE Aerospace will invest $29.4 million this year to expand its manufacturing operations in Mexico, strengthening facilities in Hermosillo and Saltillo. The bulk of the funds — $28.8 million — will go to the Hermosillo plant, which produces components for narrow-body aircraft engines. The investment will finance structural upgrades, new tools, and advanced manufacturing processes to boost capacity and efficiency.
Unison, a GE Aerospace subsidiary in Saltillo, will receive $600,000 for new machinery and inspection equipment to enhance production of ignition systems, sensors, and electrical components. The upgrades are part of GE Aerospace’s global strategy to modernize industrial capacity and accelerate next-generation engine development. Binary Container Logistics expands with major Texas lease Binary Container Logistics has inked a 296,240-square-foot lease at Sunridge Industrial Park in Wilmer, Texas, ramping up its footprint in the Dallas-Fort Worth logistics hub. The global supply chain specialist, known for its work in the energy sector, is expanding to bolster regional operations. The new facility features 40-foot clear heights, a cross-dock layout, 319 parking spaces, and 135 trailer stalls—with room to grow. Located off I-45 and I-20, Sunridge Industrial Park is developed by Atlanta-based Stonemont Financial Group, a real estate investment firm focused on industrial assets and net-lease investments.
