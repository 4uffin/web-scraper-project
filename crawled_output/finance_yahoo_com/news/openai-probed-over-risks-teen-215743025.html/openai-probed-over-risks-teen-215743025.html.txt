OpenAI Probed Over Risks to Teen Safety After Senate Testimony

(Bloomberg) -- A key Republican US senator demanded OpenAI Chief Executive Officer Sam Altman hand over documents and information about the risks ChatGPT poses to children and teens, expanding a congressional probe into artificial intelligence chatbots. Most Read from Bloomberg

Senator Josh Hawley’s Thursday letter follows a hearing Tuesday in which parents testified about ChatGPT’s alleged threats to young users. “There is increasing evidence that AI chatbots pose a grave harm to children. And your company’s products are responsible,” Hawley wrote to Altman. An OpenAI spokesperson didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. In his letter, Hawley said the company has until Oct. 17 to respond to his list of questions related to the research and design of OpenAI’s products, as well as incidents of harm to teen users. Hawley last month initially opened an investigation into Meta Platforms Inc. over reports that its chatbots may engage in “sensual” interactions with teens. --With assistance from Rachel Metz.
