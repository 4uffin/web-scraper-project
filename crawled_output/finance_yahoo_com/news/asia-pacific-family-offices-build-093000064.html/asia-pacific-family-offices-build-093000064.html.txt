Asia-Pacific family offices build resilient portfolios to withstand tariff shocks: Citi
South China Morning Post
Tue, Sep 16, 2025, 5:30 AM 3 min read
Most family offices in Asia-Pacific are bullish about their portfolios and expect decent returns this year, with interest rate cuts and advances in artificial intelligence more than offsetting tariff uncertainties, according to a Citi wealth survey released on Tuesday. More than 80 per cent of family offices in the region anticipated returns of more than 5 per cent this year, the Citi Wealth 2025 Family Office Report showed. At least 30 per cent of those surveyed expected returns of between 10 and 15 per cent, and an additional 8 per cent anticipated returns of more than 15 per cent.
Asia-Pacific family offices also responded proactively to the tariff turmoil - triggered by the US in April - more than their global counterparts, allocating 39 per cent of their resources to perceived defensive asset classes, according to the survey. They were among the most international in their outlook, with 76 per cent having a global footprint. Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world?

"We are seeing a proactive and highly confident approach to investment, particularly in public equities, coupled with a commendable dedication to nurturing the next generation of wealth stewards and embracing a global outlook," said Bernard Wai, Asia-Pacific head of Citi Wealth's global family office group in a statement.

Photo: Jonathan Wong> Global markets were thrown into a tizzy when US President Donald Trump announced reciprocal tariffs ranging from 10 per cent to as much as 49 per cent on the country's major trading partners. Global markets reacted negatively to the development, wiping out trillions of dollars from major global markets. On April 7, the Hang Seng Index slumped 13.2 per cent, its worst drop in percentage terms since the 1997 Asian financial crisis.
The Citi survey polled 346 family offices from 45 countries, of which 29 per cent were from Asia-Pacific. The average net worth of the participants was US$2.1 billion. Family offices are entities established by wealthy families to manage their succession plans, investments and charitable endeavours. In his first policy address in October 2022, Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu announced a goal of attracting at least 200 large family offices to the city by the end of 2025, which has been achieved ahead of the deadline.

There were also signs that wealthy Asia-Pacific clans were preparing to hand control to the next generation. Currently 43 per cent of wealth in the region was under second-generational control, according to the survey. The survey also showed that there were huge opportunities for education about family wealth due to the coming "wave of wealth transfers between first and second generations".
"These are exciting times for family offices worldwide," said Hannes Hofmann, head of Citi Wealth's global family office group. "These sophisticated clients are finding new ways to address their families' ever-increasing expectations," Hoffman said. "Our report highlights how they are refining priorities, reimagining their operations and seeking to build resilient portfolios." The two top concerns that emerged from the survey were the trade disputes at 61 per cent and oscillating US-China relations at 53 per cent. Trade wars were this year's top concern for family offices at 60 per cent, compared with interest rates last year. Geopolitical tensions, as well as government initiatives to attract capital, were spurring family offices to re-evaluate jurisdictions and interest in asset location, according to the survey.
The findings also indicated gaps in technology adoption, with 44 per cent of respondents lacking cybersecurity offerings.
