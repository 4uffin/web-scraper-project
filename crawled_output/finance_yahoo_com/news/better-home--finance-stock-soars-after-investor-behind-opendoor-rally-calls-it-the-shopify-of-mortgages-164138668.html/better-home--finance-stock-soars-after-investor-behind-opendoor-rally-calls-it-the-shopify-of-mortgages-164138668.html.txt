Better Home & Finance stock soars again as investor behind Opendoor rally calls it 'Shopify of mortgages'

Better Home & Finance (BETR) stock gained more than 25% in premarket trading on Tuesday, adding to Monday's 46% rally after activist investor Eric Jackson called the company "the Shopify of mortgages." Better Home, which opened for trading at $33.50 on Monday, traded as high as $73 in the wake of Jackson's announcement before giving up some of those gains and settling around $50 at Monday's close. Shares sat around $64 on Tuesday morning. Jackson said in the post that his hedge fund, EMJ Capital, has a long position in the stock.
"Better [Home] ($BETR) is the Shopify of mortgages," Jackson wrote. "It's rebuilding a $15T industry from scratch with AI ... I believe BETR is a potential 350-bagger in 2 years." "They laugh at BETR now at $34 like they laughed at [Carvana] at $3.50 and OPEN at 51¢. But this is no meme," he added.
Shopify (SHOP), the software giant whose technology enables companies to set up online storefronts, has become a dominant force in the past few years in shaping how direct-to-consumer e-commerce business is transacted. Carvana (CVNA), the stock pick that made Jackson a big name in retail trading circles, was trading below $10 when he first engaged with the company's leadership in February 2023. The stock now trades at more than $390. Jackson's call comes after a months-long saga of upheaval and price swings at fellow real estate company Opendoor Technologies (OPEN), which Jackson price-targeted at $82 in July while the company was trading firmly in penny-stock territory below $1. Read more about today's market action.
Opendoor, which now trades north of $8, most recently jumped on the news that Kaz Nejatian, the COO of Shopify, would be taking over as CEO. This comes after Opendoor's previous chief, Carrie Wheeler, resigned amid intense pressure from Jackson, co-founder Keith Rabois, and the company's retail investor base, largely arguing that Wheeler lacked the appetite for ambitious growth needed to take the company into its next stage.
Story Continues
Better Home, like Opendoor, is a digital-native real estate company intent on revolutionizing the housing market through AI and other new technologies. Read more: How to sell a house fast Where iBuyer Opendoor uses algorithms to quickly buy and flip houses for a profit, Better Home & Finance instead provides mortgage loans, homeowners insurance, and other services involved in the homebuying process. Jackson's public bet on Better Home & Finance comes just after the Federal Reserve cut rates by 25 basis points — an easing policy that is likely to provide a small boost to the home financing landscape.
