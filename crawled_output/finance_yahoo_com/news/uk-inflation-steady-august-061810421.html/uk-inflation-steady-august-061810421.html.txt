UK inflation held steady at 3.8% in August

The rate of inflation was stuck at a 19-month high during August, official figures show, keeping pressure on households as the Bank of England is expected to keep interest rates unchanged on Thursday. Figures from the Office for National Statistics on Wednesday showed the annual rate of inflation as measured by the consumer prices index remained at 3.8% last month, the same level as July and in line with expectations.
Air fares rose by less than a year ago while price increases at restaurants and hotels, and for petrol and diesel, were higher. Read more: The UK companies partnering with US big tech The core rate of inflation, which strips out volatile energy and food costs, fell to 3.6% in August, also as forecast by economists. The rate of food and drink inflation rose to 5.1% in August from 4.9% in July as shoppers continued to face higher prices for items at the till. This means that a supermarket shop that cost people £100 this time last year would be £105.10 now.
ONS chief economist Grant Fitzner said: “After last month’s increase, annual inflation was unchanged in August as various price movements offset each other. “The cost of airfares was the main downward driver this month with prices rising less than a year ago following the large increase in July linked to the timing of the summer holidays. This was offset by a rise in prices at the pump and the cost of hotel accommodation falling less than this time last year.
“Food price inflation climbed for the fifth consecutive month, with small increases seen across a range of vegetables, cheese and fish items.” Vegetables, milk, cheese and fish became more expensive, while bread and cereals and oil and fats became cheaper. Read more: Bank of England set to hold interest rates Kris Hamer, director of insight at the British Retail Consortium, said: “Households across the country are noticing the increasing cost of their weekly shop. Retailers are doing everything they can to deliver great value for their customers, but are unable to absorb the £7bn in costs they have been landed with this year thanks to rising costs of national insurance, higher NLW, and a new packaging tax. "The chancellor can help turn the tide at the budget by delivering a meaningful business rates reduction, with no shop paying more as a result. If the government instead chooses to burden the industry with more costs, then it will be households who feel the pinch as they go about their weekly shop.” The inflation figure is still well above the Bank of England’s 2% target and will cement expectations that policymakers will not be able to cut interest rates again this year.
Story Continues
Chancellor Rachel Reeves said: “I know families are finding it tough and that for many the economy feels stuck. That’s why I’m determined to bring costs down and support people who are facing higher bills. “Through our Plan for Change we are taking action — raising the national living wage, extending the £3 bus fare cap, and expanding free school meals to put more money in people’s pockets while we work to build a stronger, more stable economy that rewards hard work.” The UK continues to have the highest inflation rate among G7 countries. The US, Canada, France, Italy and Germany all recorded inflation rates lower than 3.8% in August.
Alice Haine, personal finance analyst at Bestinvest by Evelyn Partners, said: “Inflation held steady in the 12 months to August, remaining at 3.8%, offering little relief for cash-strapped households still grappling with overstretched budgets. Persistent inflation is also unwelcome news for chancellor Rachel Reeves as she prepares for her autumn budget.
"Persistently high inflation mixed in with sluggish economic output and a cooling jobs market only adds to the pressure as she considers which taxes she may target to plug the black hole in the public finances." Read more: UK state pension data reveals who may be hardest hit by age increase Reeves is due to present the autumn budget on 26 November, which is widely expected to include tax increases in an attempt to balance the nation’s books. Nicholas Hyett, investment manager at the Wealth Club, said: "Overall inflation is stuck at nearly twice the Bank of England's target rate. For poorer consumers the effective rate is probably higher still, since food accounts for a larger proportion of their total spending and food prices have risen 5.1% year-on-year. "Stubbornly high inflation means it's unlikely that the Bank of England can bail out the economy with cuts. That is doubly bad news for the government, which desperately needs either growth to pick up or rates to come down in order to free up some financial headroom."
