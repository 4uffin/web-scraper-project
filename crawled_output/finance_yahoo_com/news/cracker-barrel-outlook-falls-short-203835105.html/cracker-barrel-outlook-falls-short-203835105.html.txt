A Cracker Barrel restaurant in Sterling, Virginia.
(Bloomberg) -- Cracker Barrel Old Country Store Inc. slumped after its sales guidance missed expectations, showing the brand is still dealing with the fallout from its controversial and short-lived logo change. Most Read from Bloomberg

Revenue in fiscal 2026, which will run through next July, is projected to be in a range of $3.35 billion to $3.45 billion, the company said in a statement Wednesday. Analysts were expecting sales of $3.52 billion in the period, according to the average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The mid-point of Cracker Barrel’s range suggests sales will remain similar to the past two years, when growth has stagnated. The outlook assumes foot traffic at existing stores declines 4% to 7% in the coming year, the company said.
“The fallout from the re-branding push-back has been severe with no sign of let-up,” Truist analyst Jake Bartlett wrote in a note to clients Wednesday. Cracker Barrel’s shares fell 3.6% in New York on Thursday. The stock had declined 6.2% this year through Wednesday’s close. The company is dealing with the fallout from an online firestorm after it unveiled a new, streamlined logo that removed an overalls-clad character known as Uncle Herschel. Critics accused the company of erasing elements of traditional American culture and even President Donald Trump weighed in, saying Cracker Barrel should restore its old logo.
Shortly afterwards, Cracker Barrel reversed the logo change. It later halted planned remodels of restaurants. Since the Aug. 19 logo change, foot traffic to restaurants declined about 8%, Chief Financial Officer Craig Pommells said during a call with analysts. Assuming current trends continue, traffic is expected to fall 7% to 8% in the fiscal first quarter, he added. Chief Executive Officer Julie Masino acknowledged the impact of customer feedback on the decision to halt the rebranding plan, saying the company will now focus on improvements to its kitchen and “other areas.” Cracker Barrel projects capital expenditures of as much as $150 million, below Wall Street’s expectation for $183 million. The majority of those funds will go to maintenance, with no investment toward new remodels. The company spent around $20 million on the remodels last year, CEO Masino said during the call. It plans to revert those stores back to its traditional style.
Story Continues
Higher Prices Cracker Barrel’s prices rose 5.4% in the latest quarter, meaning sales growth in the period was driven almost entirely by those hikes. The brand has introduced both cheaper options for value-seeking diners as well as higher-cost items. Masino said the company is being “really thoughtful” with how it implements higher prices.
The company expects to raise prices by an additional 4% to 5% in the coming year. That move could “exacerbate current traffic woes” as consumers cut back on dining out, Citi analyst Jon Tower wrote in a note. The restaurant chain said its board authorized share repurchases of up to $100 million. The company hasn’t bought back stock since 2023, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It kept its quarterly dividend stable at 25 cents. Adjusted Ebitda, a measure of profitability that excludes items such as taxes and depreciation, is expected to be in a range of $150 million to $190 million in fiscal 2026. That compares with the average estimate of $233 million. In the first quarter, the company expects earnings to be “significantly below” last year’s due to the lower traffic and $16 million in marketing costs.
The company’s marketing spending plans are “unusually high,” Truist’s Bartlett said, as it seeks to win back customers spooked off by the logo controversy. The heightened scrutiny on Cracker Barrel following online commentary highlights how social media has driven market reactions for companies repeatedly in recent months. Companies that have seen moves include Kohl’s Corp. and American Eagle Outfitters Inc., which surged after President Trump tweeted praise of a controversial ad featuring actress Sydney Sweeney. On Tuesday, the mention of Krispy Kreme Inc. by FBI Director Kash Patel during his testimony before Congress sent the doughnut seller’s stock up as retail investors latched onto the name. --With assistance from Subrat Patnaik.
