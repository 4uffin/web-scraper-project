In this article:
UBER
Sands Capital, an investment management company, released its “Sands Capital Select Growth Strategy” Q2 2025 investor letter. A copy of the letter can be downloaded here.  U.S. large-cap growth equities recovered from a sharp sell-off in early April by delivering strong returns in the second quarter. The quarterly performance was driven by muted inflation, strong corporate earnings, and improving sentiment around artificial intelligence (AI) and global trade. The portfolio returned 27.7% in the quarter, outperforming the benchmark Russell 1000 Growth Index's 17.8% gain. You can check the fund’s top 5 holdings to know more about its best picks for 2025.
In its second-quarter 2025 investor letter, Sands Capital Select Growth Strategy highlighted stocks such as Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER). Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) develops and operates proprietary technology applications that operate through Mobility, Delivery, and Freight segments. The one-month return of Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) was 3.70%, and its shares gained 35.82% of their value over the last 52 weeks. On September 15, 2025, Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) stock closed at $98.85 per share, with a market capitalization of $206.144 billion. Sands Capital Select Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter: "We sold Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) after a holding period of more than five years. After initiating the investment in February 2020, Uber navigated a pandemic-related slowdown and grew bookings by over 150 percent. As the business scaled, our investment thesis played out, with profitability expanding across both the mobility and delivery segments.
