When Brokers Treat Their Carrier Partners Right, Everyone Wins
(Photo R2X. R2X turned its summer internship project into something bigger — a carrier appreciation event in Indianapolis that showed how collaboration can reset broker-carrier relationships.)
Adam Wingfield
September 17, 2025 6 min read
The Broken Broker–Carrier Dynamic Ask most small carriers what they think about brokers and you’ll get some version of the same response: “They’re just middlemen, taking their cut and squeezing us dry.” And to be fair, that feeling hasn’t come out of thin air. Too many brokerages treat carriers like interchangeable parts. They chase the lowest truck, cut communication once the load’s booked, and forget about relationships the moment the paperwork clears. The result? A trucking market that feels transactional, hostile, and short-sighted.
But every once in a while, a brokerage comes along and says: We can do this differently. That’s what happened in Indianapolis this summer. A Brokerage Willing to Flip the Script R2X, a mid-sized brokerage based out of Indianapolis, decided that their annual summer internship capstone wasn’t just going to be an internal celebration. Instead, they turned it into a carrier appreciation event — a night dedicated to the very people that keep their business alive: their carriers.
They invited 100 of their top partners. 60 showed up. And what followed wasn’t the usual “thanks for coming” dinner with empty handshakes. It was a night that gave carriers a seat at the table, both literally and figuratively.
Awards were handed out — not gimmicks, but recognition for real contributions: Most miles run, most loads delivered, and Carrier of the Year.
Data and market insights were shared — not hoarded away like leverage, but presented openly to give carriers a clear picture of where business was headed.
Dedicated reps connected directly with carriers — not through a generic support email, but face-to-face, building the kind of trust that a phone call can’t replicate.
The energy in the room was described as “immaculate.” Carriers walked out not just thanked, but energized, motivated, and, most importantly, respected.
Why This Matters For carriers, appreciation isn’t about free food or fancy awards. It’s about being treated like a partner — someone with a stake in the outcome, not just a number on a dispatch screen. That distinction matters because trucking has been in a rough cycle. Margins are thin. Rates are soft. Insurance costs are climbing. And yet carriers still show up every day to keep freight moving. When a brokerage takes time to recognize that reality — and even invest in strengthening that partnership — it creates something rare in this industry: loyalty.
Carriers Talk. And They Remember. Every carrier has a story of being burned by a broker. Maybe it was a detention payment that never came. Maybe it was a rate that dropped at the last minute. Maybe it was the radio silence once the load went south.
Story Continues
Those stories stick. They shape how carriers approach every phone call, every negotiation, every new relationship. But the opposite is also true. When a brokerage steps up — when they’re fair, transparent, and willing to invest in carriers — those stories stick too. And in a market where good capacity is scarce and reputation spreads fast, that kind of goodwill is worth more than any rate negotiation trick.
The Proof in the Numbers One of the most striking takeaways from the R2X event is that it wasn’t just “feel-good PR.” It translated into business results.
Carriers who had never run with R2X before showed up just to see what the brokerage was about. Some of those conversations turned into new dedicated opportunities.
Existing carriers left with a renewed commitment to grow with the brokerage, strengthening the core network R2X can rely on.
The team walked away with new insights, new energy, and new game plans for shared growth.
This is what happens when appreciation turns into action. A Challenge to Other Brokers Here’s the blunt truth: If you’re a broker reading this and you think you can win long-term by burning carriers, you’re wrong. The spot market may reward short-term squeezing, but the market as a whole doesn’t. Carriers remember. They choose where to put their trucks. And increasingly, they’re looking for partners who see them as more than capacity on a screen.
R2X didn’t do anything earth-shattering. They didn’t invent a new TMS. They didn’t roll out some AI scheduling tool. They simply chose to act on a principle that’s easy to talk about but rare to practice: Treat carriers like partners. The question is — why aren’t more brokerages doing the same? What Partnership Really Looks Like Partnership isn’t just a buzzword. It’s measurable. It looks like:
Transparency: Sharing data, trends, and forecasts so carriers can make informed business decisions.
Consistency: Assigning reps who know their carriers by name, not by MC number.
Recognition: Celebrating milestones, loyalty, and performance instead of treating every transaction like the first.
Investment: Building events, programs, and processes that put time and money back into carrier relationships.
None of this requires billion-dollar budgets. It requires intent. The Long-Term Play Let’s be clear: A single event doesn’t change the entire broker-carrier landscape. But it does send a message. And if more brokerages follow this example, the industry will shift. Imagine if carrier appreciation wasn’t just a once-a-year event but a regular practice. Imagine if brokers started competing not just on rates, but on trust, transparency, and relationships. Imagine if the default story carriers told about brokers wasn’t negative, but positive.
The capacity crunches, the seasonal surges, the tough markets — all of them become easier to navigate when carriers and brokers actually trust each other. A Word to Carriers For small carriers and owner-operators reading this, take note of what R2X did. This is what partnership should feel like. If you’re not getting that from your brokers, ask yourself why you keep giving them your trucks. Yes, freight is tough right now. Yes, sometimes you take what you can get. But don’t forget you have power. Your wheels move the economy. And the brokers who understand that — and show it — are the ones worth building long-term.
Final Word The industry doesn’t need another empty “carrier appreciation” email blast. It needs more brokerages willing to walk the walk. R2X showed that when you treat carriers like real partners, everyone wins. Carriers win with trust, recognition, and opportunity. Brokers win with loyalty, stronger networks, and long-term growth. And the industry as a whole wins by replacing distrust with collaboration. The challenge is simple: Will other brokers follow suit, or keep pretending the old way still works? Because if this event in Indianapolis proved anything, it’s this — the future belongs to the partnerships that are built on respect, not just revenue.
