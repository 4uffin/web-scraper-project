(Bloomberg) — Apple Inc. shares broke into positive territory for the year on Monday, the latest milestone in an advance that has put the iPhone maker within striking distance of a record. The stock rose 4.3% to $256.10, and is now up 2.3% for 2025. The stock has risen nearly 50% off a low hit during the peak of tariff-related uncertainty in April, at which point Apple was down more than 30% on the year.

Recent strength in the stock came amid waning tariff fears and growing optimism that strong demand for its latest iPhones — especially the more expensive models — would support growth. “It seems clear that demand has been more robust than expected for the new products, and that’s helping to create a stronger bid for the stock,” said Bill Stone, chief investment officer at Glenview Trust Company, which has about $15.7 billion in assets under management and owns the stock. “I think expectations had been low, so the demand is a pleasant surprise, and whenever you get a positive surprise, that’s obviously supportive for the stock,” Stone said.
Despite the move, Apple continues to trail other names within big tech, especially companies with more-pronounced exposure to artificial intelligence. The Nasdaq 100 Index is up 18% this year, with Nvidia Corp., Alphabet Inc., and Meta Platforms Inc. all trading more than 30% higher. While Microsoft Corp. has risen more than 20%, Apple remains 1.1% below its own record close. (Updates to market close.) Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek
