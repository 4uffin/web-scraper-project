‘Frothy and Risky’ Rally in Profitless Tech Grows as Fed Eases

(Bloomberg) -- Bets that the Federal Reserve will continue cutting interest rates have fueled a rally in one of the riskiest corners of the technology sector, raising concerns about a potential reversal in the stocks. A basket of unprofitable tech companies tracked by UBS Group AG has jumped 22% since the end of July, compared with a 2.5% advance for its profitable counterpart and the Nasdaq 100 Index’s 5.9% advance. The run-up has sent the group, which includes lesser-known companies like SoundHound AI Inc. and Unity Software Inc., near its highest since late 2021, when rock-bottom interest rates were fueling a bubble in speculative assets that popped the following year.

The basket of loss-making tech firms rose 0.7% Wednesday, while the profitable equivalent rose 0.4%.
The potential of a hard landing for the stocks was highlighted on Tuesday, when the group sank 2.1%, underperforming the market after Fed Chair Jerome Powell reiterated his view that policymakers face a difficult road ahead as they weigh further rate changes. Even if the central bank follows through with two more cuts this year, the benchmark rate will likely remain above 3%, a far cry from the zero-interest-rate policies during the pandemic that fueled equities.
The move in unprofitable tech stocks marks “a phase of speculative over-exuberance because the expected rate-cut cycle is leading to animal spirits being revived,” said Ted Mortonson, a tech strategist at Robert W. Baird & Co. “The rally looks extremely frothy and risky, and all the speculation from the Reddit and Robinhood crowds makes it feel like a casino, which makes me think this will end with disillusionment.” With inflation still a problem and artificial intelligence weighing on the labor market, it’s “extremely tricky” to analyze the value of money-losing companies based on what the Fed may or may not do, Mortonson added. Lower borrowing costs are crucial for money-losing firms that need to finance fast-growing operations at valuations based on profit expectations that might take years to hit. Of course, there are plenty of other areas of the stock market where speculation is running rampant amid prospects for lower rates. Riskier biotech plays are surging and the Russell 2000 Index of small caps recently hit its first record since 2021. However, the move in tech has been pronounced.
Story Continues
A similar unprofitable basket tracked by Goldman Sachs has nearly doubled from an April low, and recently hit its highest since February 2022. Notable winners include OpenDoor Technologies Inc., a so-called meme stock championed by Canadian hedge-fund manager Eric Jackson, which has soared by more than 280% since the end of July. IonQ Inc., a quantum-computing company, is up more than 80% over the same period, while SoundHound AI, Xometry Inc. and Lemonade Inc. have gained more than 50%. Despite the rally, the moves still pale in comparison with the start of the decade. Goldman’s basket soared more than 420% from March 2020 to February 2021 before giving most of the gains over the following 15 months.
Still, some investors see validity in the recent move higher, especially since the scope of the so-called dash for trash is smaller than in the previous rate-cutting cycle. Goldman’s basket for example remains about 50% below its 2021 peak. “I don’t think the exuberance is unfounded, since growth has been decent, there’s more visibility on tech earnings than other industries, AI is a unique secular tailwind, and the rate backdrop looks favorable,” said Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial Services Inc. He said “it isn’t a stretch to see more risk taking in speculative areas, which is where you find the untapped sources for upside.”
Despite that, Saglimbene stressed that the rally in unprofitable tech stocks could turn easily, with shares in the group likely to face more pressure than their high-quality counterparts in the event of a broader economic downturn. “The Fed is likely to remain guarded with its rate path, and if it starts to cut more aggressively, that’s probably because something is breaking in the economy, which won’t be positive for risky or unprofitable tech assets,” he said. “We’re in a risk-on mode right now, but if you live by the sword, you might die by it.” Tech Chart of the Day
Meanwhile, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s shares surged to their highest in nearly four years after the company revealed plans to ramp up its AI spending past an original $50 billion-plus target, joining tech leaders pledging ever-greater sums toward the race for technological breakthroughs. Top Tech Stories
Alibaba is integrating Nvidia Corp.’s suite of artificial intelligence development tools for so-called physical AI into its cloud software platform.
Cathie Wood’s funds reopened positions in Alibaba for the first time in four years, just as the stock rallied to a multi-year high on optimism over the Chinese firm’s push in AI.
Three years after OpenAI and Nvidia Corp. helped kick off the global AI frenzy, the two firms are joining forces to pave the way for a more costly phase of development with a deal that’s quickly revived fears of a bubble.
Micron Technology Inc., the largest US maker of computer memory chips, gave an upbeat forecast for the current quarter, helped by demand for artificial intelligence equipment.
