Opendoor 'Not A Meme Stock'? But It's Been Trading Like A TikTok Trend

OPEN
Opendoor Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:OPEN) are volatile Monday, coming off huge gains last week that saw the stock rise more than 50%. Despite the massive sentiment driven moves, new chairman Keith Rabois insists that Opendoor is not a meme stock.
OPEN stock is moving on heavy volume. See the real-time chart here.
Not A Meme Stock? In a CNBC interview on Friday, Rabois said that Opendoor is not a meme stock and pushed back on notions that its recent surge is purely sentiment-driven.

"Markets are designed to allocate capital. Consumers are voting with their feet to say we want more capital being allocated to Opendoor. That’s a good thing. That’s how society should work," the chairman said. Rabois cheered the involvement of individual investors and their ability to identify the fundamentals and long-term potential of Opendoor as what will drive the company's future success. "I think the whole retail movement is misunderstood. It’s better when consumers say, I want more of this and less of that. We don’t need professionals. We need consumers saying, this is what is better for society, and I want to invest more capital," Rabois said. Read Next: Trump Hints TikTok Deal Is Locked In—Youth ‘Will Be Very Happy’
Other Voices Other prominent voices have also said that Opendoor is not a meme stock. Both Opendoor promoter Eric Jackson and crypto investor Anthony Pompliano have rejected the idea that Opendoor is "just a meme stock" and rather frame the stock's story as misunderstood. They recognize risk—it will take time and execution to meet projections—but they stress that potential is a more accurate driver than sentiment.
It seems Rabois agrees and views Opendoor as a potential juggernaut with significant upside if it executes well. OPEN Price Action: Opendoor Technologies shares were up 3.66% at $9.40 at the time of publication on Monday. The stock is approaching its 52-week high of $10.70, according to Benzinga Pro data.
