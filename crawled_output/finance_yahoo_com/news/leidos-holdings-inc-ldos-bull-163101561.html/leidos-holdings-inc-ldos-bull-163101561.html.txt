Leidos Holdings, Inc. (LDOS): A Bull Case Theory
Ricardo Pillai
September 16, 2025 3 min read
In this article:
LDOS
PLTR
We came across a bullish thesis on Leidos Holdings, Inc. on Value investing subreddit by zomol. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on LDOS. Leidos Holdings, Inc.'s share was trading at $178.58 as of September 4th. LDOS’s trailing and forward P/E were 16.77 and 14.79 respectively according to Yahoo Finance.
Analyst Highlights Growth Catalysts for Leidos (LDOS)
Everett Historical / shutterstock.com Leidos (LDOS) is a mission services and systems integrator serving the Pentagon and U.S. government, with 44% of revenue from National Security & Digital programs and 30% from Health & Civil contracts. The company provides end-to-end solutions, including secure networks, sensors, cloud migrations, cyber defense, health IT systems, and long-term mission operations. Its applied AI capabilities support faster decision-making under strict security standards, making Leidos deeply embedded in critical infrastructure.
While Palantir (PLTR) appears very different as a software vendor, both companies overlap in delivering data integration, decision-support systems, and AI-enabled capabilities to governments and large institutions. The distinction lies in delivery: Leidos is service-heavy, relying on large teams, integration, and operations, while Palantir is product-heavy, monetizing platforms like Gotham, Foundry, and AIP with embedded engineers for configuration. Financially, Leidos generates $17B in annual revenue and $10.7 EPS with thin but stable margins, while Palantir earns $3.4B revenue with ~80% gross margins, reflecting its scalable software model. Valuation, however, highlights the divide: Leidos trades modestly at 15× forward P/E and 11× EV/EBITDA, while Palantir commands lofty multiples of 85× P/E and 70× EV/EBITDA, driven by AI growth expectations. For investors, the choice is between stability and asymmetry: Leidos offers predictable cash flows, a $46B backlog, and potential re-rating toward a fair value of $250–300 per share (25–30% upside), while Palantir remains riskier and priced for perfection, with fair value closer to $30–50. In risk/reward terms, Leidos stands out as the stronger and more underappreciated opportunity.
Previously we covered a bullish thesis on Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) by Deep Value Returns in May 2025, which highlighted its AI-driven software platforms, strong government and commercial contracts, and rapid revenue growth. The company's stock price has appreciated approximately by 43.43% since our coverage due to continued platform adoption. The thesis still stands as long-term AI growth remains intact. Zomol shares a similar but emphasizes Leidos’ service-heavy, mission-critical government operations and stable cash flows.
Story Continues
Leidos Holdings, Inc. is not on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 47 hedge fund portfolios held LDOS at the end of the first quarter which was 51 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of LDOS as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk. If you're looking for an extremely undervalued AI stock that also stands to benefit significantly from Trump-era tariffs and the onshoring trend, see our free report on the best short-term AI stock.
