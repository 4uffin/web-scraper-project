Disney Pulls ‘Kimmel Live’ Over Host’s Charlie Kirk Remarks
Lucas Shaw
September 18, 2025 5 min read
In this article:
DIS
(Bloomberg) -- Walt Disney Co.’s ABC network is taking off the air indefinitely amid a backlash to remarks the late-night host made about the killing of Republican activist Charlie Kirk. The move sparked a wave outrage among Hollywood stars and politicians concerned about the implications for free speech.
The company announced the decision minutes after Nexstar Media Group Inc., which owns dozens of ABC TV affiliates, said it would pull the show from its stations over remarks that were “offensive and insensitive.” The snap decision pulled Wednesday’s show off the air and came as some guests were on their way to the studio for taping.

Comedian Wanda Sykes was scheduled to appear on the show Wednesday night. Instead she posted a video to Instagram “in a full face of makeup.” She said Kimmel’s show had been canceled because of complaints from the Trump administration. “So let’s see. He didn’t end the Ukraine war or solve Gaza within his first week, but he did end freedom of speech within his first year.”
Disney’s decision to suspend one of its biggest stars underscores the treacherous political climate for major media companies and is the latest example of the Trump administration pressuring them to mind their talent’s on-air remarks. Last year, Disney paid $15 million to settle a defamation lawsuit brought by President Donald Trump over comments made by host George Stephanopoulos. The president this week sued the New York Times Co. for $15 billion, claiming it has an agenda against him.

Kimmel, who has been a vocal critic of Trump, accused Republicans of using Kirk’s death to criticize their opponents. “We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang trying to characterize this kid who killed Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them,” Kimmel said in his Sept. 15 monologue.
Conservative commentators and members of the Trump administration rebuked Kimmel for the comments. Brendan Carr, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, told podcast host Benny Johnson that he had a strong case to punish Kimmel, ABC and Disney. The FCC grants licenses to broadcasters such as ABC and its affiliates. “This is a very, very serious issue right now for Disney,” Carr said. “They have a license granted by us at the FCC, and that comes with it an obligation to operate in the public interest.”

How US Broadcast Licenses Work Kimmel had planned to address the backlash on his show Wednesday and rehearsed the program that morning, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Carr’s comments triggered Nexstar, the largest owner of local TV stations in the US, to tell Disney it would pull the show, according to two people. They asked not to be identified speaking about private deliberations. Disney then issued its own statement saying Kimmel would go off the air.
The move prompted an outpouring of comments on social media from actors, comedians and politicians. Ben Stiller, executive producer of the hit show, posted on X: “This isn’t right.” House Democratic leaders are calling for Carr’s resignation for a “corrupt abuse of power.” “Donald Trump and the Republican Party’s war on the First Amendment is blatantly inconsistent with American values,” said House Democratic leaders, including House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries, in a statement on Thursday. “Media companies, such as the one that suspended Mr. Kimmel, have a lot to explain.” Nexstar has business pending before the FCC. The broadcaster is seeking approval for a $6.2 billion agreement to acquire Tegna Inc., another local station owner, and needs Carr’s support to complete the transaction.
Separately, Sinclair Inc., the largest owner of ABC affiliates, said in a statement it will keep Kimmel’s program off the air pending discussions with the network about its “commitment to professionalism and accountability.” The broadcaster asked Kimmel to issue an apology to the Kirk family and make a donation to his political organization. Sinclair plans to air a special remembrance of Kirk during the Kimmel show’s time slot on Friday. Sinclair owns 40 ABC stations. Disney gave no indication of when or if Kimmel’s show might return. ABC aired a rerun of in its place on Wednesday night. Kimmel has been hosting his program since 2003, making him one of the longest-serving late-night talk-show personalities. He started his career as a radio host in Seattle, later moving to Tampa, Tucson, and eventually, Los Angeles. He has reduced his workload in recent years, taking the summers off from the show. His current contract is due to expire in less than a year.
In July, CBS announced it was ending its late night show hosted by Stephen Colbert, who has also been a critic of Trump. The network cited costs associated with the show, although its parent Paramount Global was seeking FCC approval for its takeover by Skydance Media. The approval was later granted. Disney’s decision will fuel concern about the Trump administration’s effort to squelch opposition to its agenda. The president got into an argument this week with ABC reporter Jonathan Karl, who had questioned the president about Attorney General Pam Bondi’s plans to “go after hate speech.” She later walked back those remarks. “Congress can make no law that fires Jimmy Kimmel for a joke, but ABC can,” Robert Thompson, director of the Bleier Center for Television and Popular Culture at Syracuse University, said in an email. “I’m sure the comedians taping shows tonight can’t help but feel skittish given the speed at which this late-night epic is unfolding.”
Media organizations have struggled with how best to cover Kirk, a conservative activist who offended many with his commentary. MSNBC fired analyst Matthew Dowd after he suggested Kirk’s language brought about his assassination. Everyday Americans, from teachers to restaurant workers, have lost their jobs or been disciplined over comments on the incident. In a post on Truth Social, Trump cheered ABC’s decision and called on NBC to fire its late-night hosts Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers. --With assistance from Thomas Buckley.
