(Reuters) -Chipmaker STMicroelectronics on Wednesday announced a $60 million investment for its plant in Tours, France, where it plans to develop a pilot line for advanced semiconductor manufacturing technology. ``
The Franco-Italian firm said it will develop the next generations of an advanced process at the plant. It has been moving older chipmaking lines away from Tours amid a major restructuring announced last October. ``
``
"This program is focused on advanced manufacturing infrastructure and brings redefined missions for some sites in France and Italy to support their long-term success," STMicro said in a statement. ``
STMicro, one of Europe's largest chipmakers, is carrying out a cost-cutting plan after a multi-year-long downturn hit its main markets, planning job cuts in plants such as Tours that have sparked opposition from unions and stakeholders. ``
The Italian and French governments own a combined 27.5% share in the chipmaker through a holding company. ``
The new technology, called Panel-Level Packaging (PLP), allows STMicro to manufacture chips on a large square panel, instead of small circular silicon wafers. ``
The company currently uses the technology for one customer at its plant in Muar, Malaysia, where it manufactures over five million chips a day, it said. ``
PLP cuts a number of manufacturing steps chipmakers typically make in Asia, where fabrication costs are lower, allowing them to be made in Europe due to economies of scale and greater automation. ``
The chipmaker expects the pilot line to be operational in the third quarter of 2026. ``
