In this article:
JAGX
Jaguar Health, Inc. (NASDAQ:JAGX) is among the best fundamentally strong penny stocks to buy right now. On September 9, 2025, Jaguar Health, Inc. (NASDAQ:JAGX) signed securities purchase agreements with some investors for the issuance and sale of nearly 951 shares of Series N Perpetual Preferred Stock. The funds from this $2.38 million private placement transaction will be allocated to working capital, general corporate purposes, and repayment of certain existing notes.
The year 2025 marked a pivotal year of convergence for Jaguar Health, Inc. (NASDAQ:JAGX). During its latest earnings call, management highlighted an intersection of clinical and regulatory catalysts that could prove transformative for the company. With a clear strategy to pursue business development partnerships for licensed rights, the company is committed to achieving the impossible.

What’s even more interesting is that Jaguar Health, Inc. (NASDAQ:JAGX) is now enhancing its product portfolio by supporting investigator-initiated trials in adult patients living with short bowel syndrome and intestinal failure. While patient treatment has already begun, results aren’t expected until 2026.
Jaguar Health, Inc. (NASDAQ:JAGX), headquartered in San Francisco, California, is a commercial-stage pharmaceuticals company specializing in plant-based prescription medicines for people and animals suffering from gastrointestinal distress. The company operates through two segments: Animal Health and Human Health. While we acknowledge the potential of JAGX as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk. If you're looking for an extremely undervalued AI stock that also stands to benefit significantly from Trump-era tariffs and the onshoring trend, see our free report on the best short-term AI stock.
