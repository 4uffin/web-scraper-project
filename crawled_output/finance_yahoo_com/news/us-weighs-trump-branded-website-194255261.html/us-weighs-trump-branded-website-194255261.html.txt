US Weighs Trump-Branded Website to Help Shop for Cheaper Drugs

(Bloomberg) — Administration officials are discussing creating a website — potentially branded with President Donald Trump’s own name — that would make it easier for patients to buy prescription medicines at a discount directly from pharmaceutical companies, people familiar with the talks said. The initiative is part of Trump’s demands that drugmakers reduce their prices to align them with what other developed countries pay, according to the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss plans that are not yet public.

The proposed website would allow patients to search for specific medicines and be connected with platforms that sell them, the people said. Officials have discussed creating a Trump brand for the website, with “TrumpRx” one name that’s been considered, they added. The plan has not yet been finalized, and discussions are ongoing ahead of a Sept. 29 deadline for companies to comply with Trump’s demands to lower prices on some widely used medicines. “Any reporting on internal deliberations is pure speculation until an official announcement is made by us,” Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson Andrew Nixon said in a statement, adding that the administration and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. are “fully dedicated to delivering most-favored-nation pricing and lowering drug costs for the American people.”
A spokesperson for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said the agency does not comment on internal deliberations. “CMS is committed to carrying out President Trump’s directive to lower prescription drug prices by ensuring Americans can access medications at fairer, more transparent prices and holding the pharmaceutical industry accountable,” the spokesperson said. Trump has launched an aggressive campaign that has targeted some of the world’s most prominent pharmaceutical companies in his bid to lower drug costs, a top priority for the president that has carried over from his first term. Trump in July sent letters to 17 of the world’s largest drugmakers insisting that they immediately lower what they charge Medicaid for existing drugs or face unspecified penalties, and he’s asked pharmaceutical companies to guarantee that future medicines be launched at prices on par with what they cost overseas. Another policy demand in the letters was that companies create platforms to sell some of their bestselling drugs that are highly discounted for health insurance directly to patients or businesses.
Story Continues
Several large drugmakers including Eli Lilly & Co., Pfizer Inc., Bristol Myers Squibb Co. and Roche Holding AG have publicly embraced the idea of selling direct to patients, rather than having them go to a pharmacy to pick up medicines. Direct sales programs can allow patients to circumvent pharmacy benefit managers that drugmakers say reduce their revenue and hurt patient access. Lilly has pioneered a model that allows patients to get cheaper weight-loss drugs by speaking to a doctor on a telehealth platform. Pfizer and Bristol launched a new direct-to-consumer platform for their Eliquis blood thinner after discussions this year with the White House.
While the Trump administration advocates for drugs to be sold directly to customers online, officials have also cracked down on pharmaceutical advertising, announcing stricter enforcement of rules around ads on television and social media. The president has also threatened the industry with stark tariffs — of up to 250% — on drug imports in a bid to pressure companies to bring more manufacturing back to the US.
