The best big banks of 2025

Key takeaways
Capital One wins as the best big bank for 2025, offering competitive rates and no monthly fees on checking and savings accounts.
The largest banks by branch count (Chase, Wells Fargo, Bank of America) didn’t make our top list due to lower rates and higher fees.
Big banks provide extensive ATM networks and branch access but typically offer lower interest rates than online banks.
Choosing the right big bank means finding one that combines convenience with competitive features. The best big banks offer extensive branch networks, top-rated mobile apps, and reasonable fees — though you’ll typically sacrifice higher interest rates for these conveniences. Unlike online banks that focus purely on rates, big banks excel at providing holistic services including mortgages, investment products and in-person customer service. Here’s which big banks deliver the best overall value in 2025. Capital One Capital One earns the top spot for the eighth consecutive year by combining competitive rates with the convenience of a traditional bank. Why it wins: Capital One’s 360 Checking Account requires no minimum balance, charges no monthly maintenance fees and offers higher yields than typical big bank accounts. Other standout features include early direct deposit access, no overdraft fees and access to over 250 branches plus 50+ café locations.
Accessible accounts Capital One checking and savings accounts and CDs have no minimum opening deposit requirement, making them accessible to a range of savers. The checking and savings accounts don’t charge a monthly service fee either. Highly-rated mobile app Capital One’s mobile app receives high ratings from users of iOS and Android devices. ATM access Customers have free access to tens of thousands of Allpoint, MoneyPass and Capital One ATMs. Read our full review:
Capital One Citibank Citibank, the banking arm of Citigroup, is the fourth-largest bank in the U.S. based on assets, according to the Federal Reserve., The bank offers a competitive yield on its Citi Accelerate High Yield Savings account and no minimum deposit is required to open it. The account is available in most, but not all, U.S. states. Other standout features include a highly-rated mobile app and ample branch access.
Digital leader Citi’s mobile app receives high ratings from users of both iOS and Android devices. Customers can also use the app to pay friends with Zelle and even lock or unlock a card. Branch access Citibank has 666 locations in the U.S., as of late December 2023, according to data from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., or FDIC.
Story Continues
Competitive savings yields Citibank offers a competitive yield on its savings account online, but it’s not available in all areas. Read our full review:
Citibank Morgan Stanley Private Bank Perhaps known best for its wealth management services, Morgan Stanley Private Bank offers its personal banking services through E*TRADE, and it offers CDs, savings and checking accounts. The bank doesn’t maintain branches, but anyone in the U.S. can open an account online. High-yield accounts E*TRADE from Morgan Stanley offers a couple of accounts with ultra-competitive yields, including a checking account that offers a nearly unmatched APY.
Wide range of CDs Morgan Stanley offers a variety of CD terms. All of them come with high APYs, and there’s no minimum deposit requirement to open an account, to boot. Highly-rated mobile app Both iOS and Android users indicate satisfaction with Morgan Stanley’s E*TRADE mobile app. The app lets you manage your accounts, in addition to investing and trading. Read our full review:
Morgan Stanley Private Bank M&T Bank M&T offers a full range of personal and business banking products. Some of the bank’s accounts offer competitive rates, but others remain lackluster, including the Relationship Savings account. Branch access M&T Bank operates more than 1,000 branches and 1,800 ATMs in 14 Eastern states and the District of Columbia. It’s headquartered in Buffalo, New York, and was founded as Manufacturers and Traders Trust Co. in 1856.
Mixed mobile app The bank’s mobile app garners high ratings on the Apple App Store, making it a good choice for those who prefer managing their finances right from their smartphone. However, the app fairs significantly worse on the Google Play Store, indicating the experience may not be as good for Android users. Some access accounts M&T Bank offers a checking account without monthly maintenance fees or minimum balance requirements. Unfortunately, the same can’t be said for many of its other accounts, including some of its savings accounts, which come with a hefty monthly fee that isn’t easily waived. Read our full review:
M&T Bank Huntington Bank While Huntington Bank has a relatively small physical footprint, extending to just 12 states, the bank offers several accounts that can be opened online. Huntington Bank offers a full suite of deposit products, ranging from certificates of deposits (CDs) all the way to money market accounts. So, if you’re looking to consolidate your finances under one roof, Huntington may be a good choice.
See more:
Top CD rates Branch access Huntington Bank maintains about 1,000 branches across 12 states. Most of them are in the Midwest.  The bank also maintains approximately 1,600 fee-free ATMs. Wide range of products Huntington offers every type of deposit account you might need, both for personal and business purposes. The bank also offers a host of credit and loan options, including mortgage banking services, in addition to wealth management services. Highly-rated mobile app Huntington Bank’s mobile app scores high marks across both the Apple App and Google Play stores. Read our full review:
Huntington Bank What makes a big bank “best”
Branch and ATM access remains crucial for many customers who need in-person banking services or prefer physical locations for complex transactions. The best big banks offer extensive networks that make banking convenient whether you’re at home or traveling. These are the most popular banks in each state, by number of branches.
Mobile banking technology has become a key differentiator. Top-rated apps offer features like mobile check deposits, early direct deposit, budgeting tools and seamless money transfers.
Fee structures vary dramatically between big banks. The best ones either eliminate common fees or make them easy to avoid through reasonable requirements like direct deposit.
Product variety gives big banks an advantage over online-only institutions. Full-service banks offer everything from basic checking to mortgages, investment accounts and business banking.
Big banks vs. online banks
Big bank advantages
Branch access for complex transactions, safe deposit boxes, and face-to-face customer service remains valuable for many customers.
Comprehensive services including mortgages, auto loans, investment accounts and business banking create convenience for customers who want all their financial services in one place.
ATM networks from big banks often rival or exceed those offered by online banks, providing broad geographic coverage.
Relationship benefits may include waived fees, rate bonuses or priority service when you maintain multiple accounts.
Big bank disadvantages
Lower interest rates are the most significant drawback. Big banks typically offer savings rates well below what you’ll find at online institutions.
Higher fees including monthly maintenance charges, overdraft fees, and minimum balance requirements can quickly erode your returns.
Less competitive on pure rate comparisons, making them expensive choices if maximizing interest earnings is your priority.
Big banks compete on different factors than online banks. While online institutions focus on high interest rates, large banks emphasize convenience, services and accessibility. How to choose the right big bank Evaluate your banking habits first. Do you frequently visit branches? Do you need comprehensive services like mortgages and investment accounts? Are you comfortable with online-only relationships? Compare fee structures carefully. Monthly maintenance fees can cost $120+ annually, making them expensive unless easily waived. Look for banks that waive fees with direct deposit or reasonable minimum balances. Test mobile apps since you’ll likely use them frequently. Download apps from banks you’re considering and test basic functions like check deposits and transfers. Consider your location and travel patterns. If you frequently travel domestically, a bank with broad geographic coverage may be worth lower rates. Learn more:
