Morning Bid: Ailing dollar gets toehold as Fed awaited

By Mike Dolan LONDON (Reuters) - What matters in U.S. and global markets today By Mike Dolan, Editor-at-Large, Finance and Markets With a first Federal Reserve interest rate cut of 2025 now considered to be in the bag, world markets are hungry for signals on how much more comes after. This has allowed the dollar to stabilize at four-year lows against the euro ahead of today's decision.
U.S. stocks also stalled on Tuesday and futures were flat ahead of today's bell, with Fed rate cut bets now gravitating to exactly 25 basis points after news of roaring 5% annual retail sales growth in August helped put the kibosh on thoughts of a bigger move this week. Gold backed off too. That didn't stop U.S. long bonds rallying further, however. Helped by brisk demand for 20-year debt at Tuesday's auction, the 30-year yield hit a 4-1/2 month low of 4.62% ahead of the Fed announcement. * Hong Kong shares closed at their highest level in fouryears, as the expected Fed cut, weakening dollar and buoyantlocal technology stocks all helped. Amid signs of returningforeign funds, confidence in China's artificial intelligencecapabilities is rising and U.S. President Donald Trump'sannouncement of a deal to keep TikTok operating in Americalifted appetite for risk assets. The U.S. and Chinese presidentsare due to speak on Friday. By contrast, Nvidia slipped onTuesday and continued to fall another 1% overnight on reports ofweak China demand for a new AI chip and after the FinancialTimes reported that China's main regulator told the country'sbig tech firms to stop buying all of Nvidia's AI chips. * The euro surged to a four‑year high against a weakeningdollar on Tuesday, but the greenback stabilized somewhat todayand the dollar index bounced slightly from two-month lows.However, China's offshore yuan continues to boom to itsstrongest level of the year - and the best since the U.S.election. Japan's yen was at its strongest in a month ahead ofFriday's Bank of Japan decision and the Canadian dollar steadiedahead of Wednesday's expected quarter point rate cut by the Bankof Canada. Soft Canadian August inflation data on Tuesdayunderscored BOC easing bets. The Aussie dollar fell back fromTuesday's one-year high. * With Trump visiting Britain and the Bank of England'spolicy decision tomorrow, sterling hovered close to two-monthhighs against the ailing dollar and UK stocks and gilt priceswere firmer. As part of the state visit, Britain and the UnitedStates agreed a technology pact to boost ties in AI, quantumcomputing and civil nuclear energy - and top U.S. firms led byMicrosoft pledged 31 billion pounds ($42 billion) in UKinvestments. BoE easing bets for the rest of this year are offas UK inflation in August held at 3.8% as expected - the highestinflation among major advanced economies.
Story Continues
In today's column, I take a look at whether the Fed might soon start stimulating an already healthy economy and explore how challenging it is to determine exactly where "neutral" truly is. Today's Market Minute * President Donald Trump on Tuesday announced an agreement between the U.S. and China to keep TikTok operating in the United States, with three sources familiar with the matter saying the deal was similar to one discussed earlier this year.
* Britain and the United States have agreed a technology pact to boost ties in AI, quantum computing and civil nuclear energy. The "Tech Prosperity Deal" is part of U.S. President Donald Trump's second state visit to Britain, which formally begins on Wednesday. * President Donald Trump's renewed push to nix quarterly corporate disclosures, a drive that went nowhere in his first administration, has a better chance this time as the White House takes more control of the Securities and Exchange Commission's agenda. * The Trump administration has made it clear that they think Chair Jay Powell’s team has done a poor job with inflation control. Eurizon SLJ asset management CEO Stephen Jen argues that the president may have a point.
* The rush to hedge U.S. equity exposure this year was initially seen as part of a broad 'de-dollarization' process. But, writes ROI markets columnist Jamie McGeever, as the months go by and U.S. stocks roar to fresh tech-fueled highs, this theory seems to be crumbling. Chart of the day There may be many reasons why the Fed decides to resume policy easing with its first interest rate cut of the year on Wednesday - but the current pace of GDP growth, booming retail sales, the loosest financial conditions in more than three years and inflation still far above target are not among them.
