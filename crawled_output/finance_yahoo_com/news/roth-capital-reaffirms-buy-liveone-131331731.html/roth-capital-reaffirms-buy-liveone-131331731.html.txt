In this article:
LVO
LiveOne, Inc. (NASDAQ:LVO) is among the best fundamentally strong penny stocks to buy right now. Sean McGowan, an analyst at Roth Capital, has reaffirmed his ‘Buy’ rating on LiveOne, Inc. (NASDAQ:LVO), while reducing the price target to $1.30 from $1.50, implying a potential upside of nearly 143% from the current level. Despite a 13.33% decline in the guidance, the analyst remains confident about the company’s performance. Just recently, LiveOne, Inc. (NASDAQ:LVO) revised its previously authorized $12 million stock repurchase program. According to the announcement, senior executives, directed by Robert Ellin, chairman and CEO, are set to purchase as many as 5 million shares. As expressed by Ellin, “We believe our stock remains significantly undervalued, and this commitment reflects our strong confidence in LiveOne’s growth trajectory and long-term value.”
What’s truly interesting about LiveOne, Inc. (NASDAQ:LVO) is its strategic partnerships and financial resilience. During its earnings call, the management highlighted its collaboration with a Fortune 500 giant that has the potential to surpass 30 million paying subscribers, on track to outshine the previous Tesla deal.
LiveOne, Inc. (NASDAQ:LVO) is a California-based digital media company operating through three segments: PodcastOne, Slacker, and Media Group. Founded in 2009, the company is committed to becoming an “all-in-one” destination for media consumers. While we acknowledge the potential of LVO as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk. If you're looking for an extremely undervalued AI stock that also stands to benefit significantly from Trump-era tariffs and the onshoring trend, see our free report on the best short-term AI stock.
