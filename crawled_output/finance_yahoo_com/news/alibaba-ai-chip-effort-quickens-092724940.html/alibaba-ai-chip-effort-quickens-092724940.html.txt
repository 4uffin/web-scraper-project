Alibaba AI Chip Effort Quickens With Big Client China Unicom

(Bloomberg) — Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (BABA) has secured a high-profile customer in China Unicom (0762.HK) for its AI chips, suggesting the Chinese tech leader’s nascent semiconductor efforts are gaining traction in its home market. China’s e-commerce leader has signed a contract with the country’s No. 2 wireless carrier to deploy its Pingtouge or “T-Head” AI accelerators, according to a video posted late Tuesday by state broadcaster CCTV. The chips will go into the mobile operator’s big new data center in northwestern China, alongside accelerators provided by rivals MetaX and Biren Technology Co. Alibaba’s shares gained 5.3% Wednesday to their highest level since 2021, joining a broad Chinese tech stock rally as investors piled into major AI-related names.

It’s unclear to what extent Unicom is deploying Alibaba chips. But the report suggests growing adoption of products emerging from its semiconductor unit T-Head, designed to compete with Huawei Technologies Co.’s Ascend series and Cambricon Technologies Corp. Alibaba, which is setting aside some 380 billion yuan ($53.5 billion) over three years on AI infrastructure, is considered a newer entrant to the field but is investing in the technology in part to wean itself off a reliance on Nvidia Corp. designs. The visuals confirmed previous Chinese media reports that Alibaba’s cloud unit had begun providing tens of thousands of AI chips to Unicom’s data centers, without specifics.
Alibaba is staging a comeback in the post-DeepSeek era, joining a nationwide race to develop AI and the infrastructure that supports it. The growing hype around T-Head and chip innovation coincides with the increasing involvement of co-founder Jack Ma this year in many aspects of the business. Goldman Sachs this week raised its price target and estimates for the company’s cloud business — a bright spot in its most-recent quarterly results. Alibaba just released an open-source Tongyi Deep Research model — part of a panoply of AI platforms that the company has trotted out in past months to compete globally with OpenAI and DeepSeek.
Details about Alibaba’s AI chip effort emerged after CCTV filmed a small billboard containing information about Unicom’s chip usage at its Sanjiangyuan data center in Qinghai province. The shot was contained in a longer report centered on Chinese Premier Li Qiang’s visit to the area earlier this week. Unicom revealed in a separate presentation that Alibaba’s AI chip sported superior hardware specifications to Huawei’s Ascend 910B, including more advanced memory, according to CCTV. Still, Huawei is now moving to market the more powerful 910C. The Wall Street Journal reported last month that Alibaba has created its own AI chip, capable of operating AI services like DeepSeek’s R1 and its own Qwen models.
Story Continues
CCTV’s Tuesday clip also showed racks of servers sporting Alibaba Cloud’s logo, as well as those of Unicom and the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the nation’s premier government-run research organization. Unicom and Alibaba representatives didn’t respond to emailed requests for comment. Alibaba’s chip endeavor mirrors projects underway at major Chinese tech firms, which are exploring their own AI silicon with most advanced Nvidia chips banned from the country. Nvidia’s AI accelerators are considered the gold standard in training cutting-edge models from OpenAI and Anthropic. In August, Baidu Inc. said it won a 1 billion yuan contract to provide China Mobile, Unicom’s larger rival, with servers powered by its Kunlun chips.
