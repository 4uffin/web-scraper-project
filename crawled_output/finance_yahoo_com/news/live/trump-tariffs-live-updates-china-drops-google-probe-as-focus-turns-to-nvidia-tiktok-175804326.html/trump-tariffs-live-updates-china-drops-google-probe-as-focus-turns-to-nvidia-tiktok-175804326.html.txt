Trump tariffs live updates: US to impose tariffs on pharma imports, kitchen cabinets, furniture, heavy trucks
Yahoo Finance
Updated Thu, September 25, 2025 at 6:44 PM MDT 2 min read
In this article:
BA
ORCL
In a trio of posts on Truth Social on Thursday evening, President Trump said the US would impose a slew of tariffs starting Oct. 1. Trump said imported kitchen cabinets, bathroom vanities, pharmaceutical imports, and heavy trucks will be taxed in the latest move to try to force more manufacturing onto US soil.
The tariffs range from 30% to 100% on the products, with exceptions for pharmaceuticals where the producer "IS BUILDING their Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Plant in America." Trump has long previewed the pharma tariffs, but the other goods represent new targets in his expanding tariff agenda. Earlier Thursday, Trump floated using revenue the US has accrued from his tariffs to offer bailouts to farmers struggling with the early effects of the duties. Trump said farmers are, "for a little while, going to be hurt until the tariffs kick into their benefit." It's unclear what mechanism the administration would use to provide relief to farmers, and it could run into issues with a looming Supreme Court review of the tariffs. An unfavorable ruling to the administration, which would follow lower court decisions, could force the administration to refund billions of dollars of that revenue. Meanwhile, the administration has launched an investigation into imports of robotics, industrial machinery, and medical devices.
Elsewhere, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Wednesday touted US "levers" that he said could give the Trump administration an upper hand toward striking a broad trade deal with China, a key focus of the administration this fall. The US and China are in the final stages of negotiations for a "huge" Boeing (BA) aircraft deal that could end up as a "centerpiece" of a broader trade agreement between the nations.
The US and China have made progress toward various contours of a broader deal following a call between Trump and China's President Xi Jinping. Trump said after that call that the countries had reached an agreement to spin off the TikTok app in the US, with the White House later naming Oracle (ORCL) as part of the consortium of investors. Trump said the two leaders plan to conduct a series of meetings in the coming months, as Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul reported.

Trump declares Oct.1 date for new tariffs furniture, kitchen cabinets, and 100% tariffs on pharma imports
In the most recent of a trio of posts on Truth Social, President Trump said the US would impose tariffs "on all Kitchen Cabinets, Bathroom Vanities, and associated products" alongside "a 30% Tariff on Upholstered Furniture." Trump cited a "FLOODING" of the products into the US from foreign countries as the reason behind the tariffs. Trump also posted "we will be imposing a 100% Tariff on any branded or patented Pharmaceutical Product, unless a Company IS BUILDING their Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Plant in America." Trump's first post in the flurry of announcements was the declaration of a 25% on all heavy truck manufacturers. He declared that "Heavy (Big!) Trucks" from overseas would be targeted in the first move in that industry.

Trump floats bailouts for farmers using tariff revenue
President Trump on Thursday floated using some of the tariff revenue the US has taken in so far to provide cash bailouts to farmers struggling with the early effects of the duties. "We're going to take some of that tariff money and give it to our farmers," Trump said. He admitted that farmers are, "for a little while, going to be hurt until the tariffs kick into their benefit." The administration has for weeks said it is looking into the potential relief for farmers, though it's unclear how they would attempt to provide it. The Trump administration provided billions in farmer aid during the trade wars of his first term, mostly due to the effects of retaliatory tariffs from China.

India says it wants to purchase more US energy in bid to lower tariffs
India has said it wants to increase its purchase of oil and gas from the US, according to Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal. The move may help to lower tariffs on New Delhi's exports and also aid in securing a trade deal. This latest news comes after President Trump imposed 50% tariffs on India due to its purchase of Russian oil, which Trump said has aided the Ukraine war. It also follows Washingtons move last week, where they slapped $100,000 fees on new H-1B visa used mainly by Indian tech workers. Bloomberg News reports: Read more here.

Fed's Powell: Tariff inflation has been 'later and less' than expected
Fed Chair Powell said Tuesday that businesses passing higher costs from tariffs on to consumers has been "later and less than we expected." Still, he noted that tariffs are driving up inflation "a bit" and that it's something the central bank is watching closely as it balances inflation risks with risks to employment. Much of the attention in discussions about the effects of tariffs has been focused on the rising cost of goods. However, Powell pointed out that US trade and economic policies may be affecting hiring decisions as well. "Job creation has dropped very sharply. So why is that?" Powell said. "I think part of it just is there's a lot of uncertainty about the direction of public policy, and so companies are holding off. They're not hiring. And when you don't hire through attrition, your labor force shrinks, and you save money that way." "That may be a way of passing on tariff costs," Powell said.
