Trump tariffs live updates: US-China talks on 'huge' Boeing order could be centerpiece of trade agreement
Yahoo Finance

In this article:
BA
ORCL
The US and China are in the final stages of negotiations for a "huge" Boeing (BA) aircraft deal that could end up as a "centerpiece" of a broader trade agreement between the nations. “This is a huge order, and it’s very important to the president. Very important for Boeing. I think it’s very important to China,” US Ambassador to China David Perdue said Tuesday.
Boeing has been working on finalizing a deal with China to sell as many as 500 aircrafts. The order has been years in the making. In other China trade-related developments, Reuters reported Tuesday that Chinese buyers have booked at least 10 cargoes of Argentine soybeans, dealing another blow to US farmers who have been shut out of their main market and hit by low prices. The US and China have made progress toward various contours of a broader deal ollowing a Friday call between Trump and China's President Xi Jinping. Trump said after that call that the countries had reached an agreement to spin off the TikTok app in the US, with the White House later naming Oracle (ORCL) as part of the consortium of investors. Trump said the two leaders plan to conduct a series of meetings in the coming months, Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul reported, with the first meeting at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in South Korea, scheduled for Oct. 30-Nov. 1.
In the background, the Supreme Court is reviewing a high-stakes legal challenge to President Trump's tariffs, setting up a resolution as early as this fall. The tariffs at stake are the sweeping "reciprocal," country-specific duties Trump has outlined in various steps this year (which you can see in the graphic above). Those duties range from 10% to 50%. Trump has used a 1977 law known as "IEEPA" — the International Emergency Economic Powers Act — to justify imposing the tariffs. The appeals court allowed the tariffs to stay in place while the case moves through the legal process.
