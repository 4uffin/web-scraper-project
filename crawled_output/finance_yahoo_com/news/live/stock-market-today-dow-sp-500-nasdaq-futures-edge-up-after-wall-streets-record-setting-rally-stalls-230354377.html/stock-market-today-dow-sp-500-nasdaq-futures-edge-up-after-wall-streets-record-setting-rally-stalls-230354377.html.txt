Stock market today: Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq slip for 2nd day in a row as Fed sends mixed signals, Alibaba plans AI push

US stocks fell on Wednesday as Wall Street digested mixed messaging from Fed officials on interest rates. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) slid 0.3% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) declined by about 0.4%, The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) dropped 0.3%. The declines marked a reversal from the indexes' earlier gains.
Debate over the prospects for US interest rate cuts — the big focus for markets right now — appeared to pressure stocks. Comments from Federal Reserve officials this week have hinted at growing disagreement on what the path of policy should be, given cracks showing in the labor market. Fed Chair Jerome Powell reiterated in a speech on Tuesday that the central bank would proceed cautiously on further rate cuts, even as he left the door open to more easing. He also described stocks as "fairly highly valued."
Wall Street is now counting down to the release of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, on Friday. Markets are watching for reassurance that inflation isn't posing a threat to high expectations for two more rate cuts this year. On Wednesday, fresh data from the Commerce Department's Census Bureau showed new home sales unexpectedly surged in August as mortgage rates began to ease, bringing homebuyers off the sidelines and releasing pent-up demand. Still, affordability concerns persist. Meanwhile, some tech stocks are showing gains despite a broader drop across the Nasdaq, which snapped a winning streak on Tuesday amid losses for the "Magnificent Seven" Big Tech stocks. Alibaba stock (BABA) jumped 8% as investors welcomed the Chinese tech giant's pledge to hike its AI spending beyond its original $50 billion target. The boost is needed for Alibaba to keep pace as global investment in AI surges to $4 trillion, its CEO said.
Tesla (TSLA) shares climbed 4% and were on track to close at their highest level in 2025 as analysts at investing firm Mizuho Securities lifted their price outlook on the stock to $450. The analysts noted the EV maker is seeing only a "muted" impact from tariffs and boosted optimism for the company's robotaxi ambitions. At the same time, Micron's (MU) stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings delivered a positive signal for the AI trade, though shares in the memory chipmaker — which supplies semiconductors for Nvidia's (NVDA) AI systems — fell on Wednesday.

Stocks retreat for second day in a row despite Tesla rally, Alibaba's big AI spend pledge
Stocks fell for a second day in a row on Wednesday. Major AI spending plans from e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA) and a rally in Tesla (TSLA) shares were not enough to keep the market momentum going. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) slipped 0.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) declined by about 0.4%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) dropped 0.3%. The declines came as investors parsed recent Fed member commentary about the central bank's path forward. Alibaba stock jumped as much as 10% as the Chinese tech giant pledged to hike its AI spending beyond its original $50 billion target. Tesla shares climbed as much as 4% after analysts at investing firm Mizuho Securities lifted their price outlook on the stock to $450.

Gold rally 'bodes well for bitcoin', says Fundstrat strategist
Gold (GC=F) has outpaced both stocks and crypto this year, and its run could be a bullish signal for bitcoin’s next move. The precious metal is up more than 40% year-to-date, compared to a more than 12% gain in the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and a 20% increase in bitcoin (BTC-USD). September is typically a volatile month for the world’s largest cryptocurrency, though the final quarter of the year often brings seasonal tailwinds for digital assets. Sean Farrell, head of digital asset strategy at Fundstrat, noted that gold tends to front-run bitcoin. "Gold generally has at least over the past few years, has led bitcoin rallies," Farrell said during a client video on Tuesday evening. "I think that that is just, it bodes well for bitcoin. In Q4, I think really we just need to wait," he said.

Meta stock in focus as Instagram hits 3 billion monthly active users
Meta (META) shares moved up fractionally Wednesday after CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that Instagram has reached 3 billion monthly active users. Meta's stock is up roughly 28% in 2025, ahead of the 17% gain for the entire group of "Magnificent Seven" Big Tech stocks.
Meta has been rapidly expanding its AI investments, twice raising its capital expenditure forecasts for the 2025 fiscal year. The Facebook and Instagram parent on Tuesday said the company upped its investments in an AI-enabled Alabama data center to $1.5 billion. And plans to power its massive Louisiana data center have been approved despite public concerns over higher energy bills and water shortages that could emerge from the project.

New home sales unexpectedly jump in August
Fresh data from the Census Bureau Wednesday showed new home sales unexpectedly surged in August as mortgage rates began to ease, bringing homebuyers off the sidelines and releasing pent-up demand. New home sales jumped over 20% to a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 800,000 units in August — more than the 650,000 units expected by economists, Reuters reported. Still, affordability concerns for homebuyers continue. Homebuilders are often more willing to cut prices and offer incentives to lure buyers than sellers of older homes, so it remains to be see if recent rate relief is enough to bring the housing market out of its funk.

Intel shares jump nearly 5%, set for 52-week high
Intel (INTC) shares jumped nearly 5% on Wednesday, putting the stock on track to close at its highest in a year.
The move comes as Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in an interview on Fox's "Mornings with Maria" that the US's decision to take a stake in Intel was "validated" by Nvidia's (NVDA) move to invest $5 billion in the struggling chipmaker last week. To be sure, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told reporters in a press conference at the time of the announcement that the two companies had been discussing a collaboration for nearly one year and that the US government had no involvement in those discussions. The US made an $8.9 billion investment in Intel in August, taking a roughly 10% stake in the company. Intel is the only large-scale, leading-edge US-based chip manufacturer, and the success of its manufacturing business is seen by many as significant to national security.

Tesla jumps as Mizuho Securities lifts price target to $450
Tesla stock jumped more than 3% Wednesday, leading the "Magnificent Seven" Big Tech stocks as Mizuho Securities analyst Vijay Rakesh lifted his price outlook on shares to $450 from $375. Rakesh said Tesla is expected to see a "minimal impact" from US tariffs. He said the proposed trillion-dollar pay package for Elon Musk and Musk's $1 billion Tesla stock purchase could "could align mgmt [managementincentives to push toward our blue sky scenario of increasing humanoid robots/robotaxi adoption."
Tesla's gain put the stock on track to close at its highest level in 2025 after jumping to a year-to-date high earlier this week.

Marvell stock rises on news of $5 billion share buyback
Shares in Marvell Technology (MRVL) rose over 3% after the US chipmaker said its board has authorized a new $5 billion stock buyback.
CEO Matt Murphy said the move "reflects our conviction in the business and the intrinsic value of our stock," according to a company statement on Wednesday. Marvell makes custom chips for companies including Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Meta (META), per Bloomberg data. The company also struck a partnership with Nvidia (NVDA) this year to allow customers to integrate its chips into the tech giant's AI systems. "Our strong balance sheet provides us the flexibility to continue investing in long-term growth, particularly as we pursue the large and expanding opportunity in accelerated infrastructure for AI," Murphy said. The chipmaker's earnings and revenue have surpassed Wall Street's expectations in four of its past five quarterly reports. Despite Wednesday's gain, its shares are down roughly 30% in 2025 so far.

Micron stock falls after earnings beat
Micron (MU) stock fell over 2% early Wednesday despite its quarterly earnings results surpassing Wall Street's expectations.
The memory chipmaker, which supplies its HBM (high bandwidth memory) chips to Nvidia (NVDA) for the tech giant's AI systems, reported fourth quarter revenue and earnings and first quarter guidance above Wall Street analysts' projections Tuesday after the bell. The beat was seen as a positive signal for the AI trade as Micron's CEO said he expects "trillions of dollars to be invested in AI" in the coming years. Analysts across Wall Street lifted their price targets on the stock following the results. But Hedgeye Risk Management analysts, who hold a short position on Micron, noted that its HBM revenue for the quarter (the three months ending Aug. 28) was below expectations, coming in at "nearly $2 billion" versus the $2 billion projected. Micron has risen to prominence as one of two suppliers of HBM to Nvidia's AI systems amid a wave of investment in AI data centers, alongside Korea-based rival SK Hynix (000660.KS). The world's other major memory chipmaker, Samsung (005930.KS), has fallen behind, but the Korean tech giant recently qualified to supply its HBM3E memory chips to Nvidia, adding competition for Micron. "Our Short thesis is predicated on MU losing material market share to Samsung next year on HBM," Hedgeye Risk Management analysts wrote in a note on Wednesday.

Stocks rise at the open as Alibaba lifts AI hopes
US stocks rose at the open on Wednesday as Alibaba's (BABA) plans to hike its artificial intelligence spending lifted hopes for a continuation of the AI-fueled tech rally. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) moved up nearly 0.3%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) nudged around 0.2% higher.

Alibaba stock pops, lifting Chinese chipmaker stocks
Chinese tech and chipmaker stocks got a lift on Wednesday following an 8% rise in Alibaba (BABA) stock after the company announced its growing AI spending ambitions. Shares of SMIC (0981.HK), China's largest semiconductor foundry, rose 5% while Hua Hong (1347.HK) added nearly 4% in Hong Kong. In Shanghai, shares of Cambricon (688256.SS), a challenged to Nvidia (NVDA), gained 1.7%.
The moves came after Alibaba revealed plans to spend more than $50 billion on artificial intelligence in order to keep up with the pace of investment from other large tech leaders. Also helping the stock were increased bets from Cathie Wood's Ark Invest. The firm reopened two positions in Alibaba stock and also invested in other Chinese stocks, including Baidu (BIDU) and Pony AI (PONY). Baidu stock climbed 3%, while Pony AI stock advanced 2%.

Lithium Americas stock soars as Trump administration explores equity stake
Lithium Americas (LAC) stock jumped about 70% higher ahead of the opening bell on Wednesday after Reuters reported that the Trump administration is seeking an equity stake of as much as 10% in the company.
The Trump administration is intervening in the company as a way of renegotiating a $2.26 billion Department of Energy loan granted under the Biden administration for the Thacker Pass lithium project. Trump has also pushed for the US to take stakes in Intel (INTC), MP Materials (MP), and other companies seen as critical to national security. The Thacker Pass mining project, which Lithium Americas is undertaking with General Motors (GM), is slated to become the Western Hemisphere's largest source of lithium when it opens in 2028, per Reuters, as well as a key project in bolstering the US's lithium supply chain. Lithium Americas confirmed that it's in discussions with the Energy Department and GM regarding the Thacker Pass project and said "the company continues to work with the DOE and GM regarding proposals for a mutually agreeable resolution."

European defense stocks rise after Trump switches position on Russia, Ukraine
European defense stocks rose on Wednesday after President Trump reversed his position on the Russia-Ukraine war, saying that Ukraine could regain all its territory and calling Russia a "paper tiger." Germany's Rheinmetall (RHM.DE) rose 2%, while the country's Hensoldt (HAG.DE) and Sweden's SAAB (SAAB-B.ST) added over 4% on an overall down day for the major European indexes. UK’s BAE Systems (BA.L) gained about 1%.
"I think Ukraine, with the support of the European Union, is in a position to fight and WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form," Trump said on Truth Social on Tuesday afternoon. "With time, patience, and the financial support of Europe and, in particular, NATO, the original Borders from where this War started, is very much an option." Earlier on Tuesday, Trump told reporters that NATO countries should shoot down Russian military aircraft in their airspace, though he said it "depends on the circumstance" if the US would back up its allies.

The Fed's unity is already fraying
Last week, the Fed voted to cut interest rates in a decision that expressed unity despite a sole dissent. But a mere week later, commentary from central bankers is foreshadowing disagreement to come, noted Yahoo Finance's Hamza Shaban. He reports in today's takeaway from Morning Brief: Read more here.

Important point from Micron on its earnings call
Micron Technology (MU) did its part this week to contribute to the AI bullishness. Here's what the memory chipmaker's execs said on an earnings call last night, when asked about the demand outlook: Couple this with the $100 billion Nvidia (NVDA) and OpenAI (OPAI.PVT) deal this week, and Alibaba (BABA) saying today it would spend more than $50 billion over three years on AI models, and it's hard to play the bear hand on AI names right now.

Time to read up on a government shutdown (again)
It has been a hot minute since markets had to worry about a government shutdown. We have been here before, and a shutdown is usually averted last minute. That's why the market tends to take the ordeal in stride until it absolutely can't. Helpful context on the latest brewing debacle from Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid:

It has been a September for investors
A lot has been thrown at the market so far in September — a month that seasonally isn't often great from a historical perspective. But here we are, getting bullish AI comments from Alibaba (BABA) and Nvidia (NVDA) this week, and a rate cut last week. Good point this morning from the host of the Yahoo Finance Trader Talk podcast, Kenny Polcari:
