Stock market today: Dow jumps, Nasdaq slips as stocks regroup in wait for Powell

^GSPC
ES=F
^IXIC
US stocks diverged Tuesday after another record-setting day, as Wall Street waited for the first speech from Chair Jerome Powell since the Federal Reserve started cutting interest rates again. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) jumped around 0.4%. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) hovered around the flatline, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) lost more than 0.3%.
Stocks jumped on Monday to clinch a third straight day of record-high closes, lifted by optimism that the AI trade and further Fed policy easing will continue to fuel the rally. The Nasdaq (^IXIC) led the gains as Nvidia stock surged (NVDA) after the chipmaker said it will invest at least $100 billion in OpenAI (OPAI.PVT).
On the Fed-watching side, Powell is scheduled to deliver a speech on monetary policy later Tuesday, in high focus after policymakers last week lowered rates for the first time in 2025. His comments will set the stage for the release on Friday of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures index. Wall Street will look for signs that already sticky inflation isn't heating up, which could dent high expectations for two more rate reductions this year. Other data released Tuesday showed that US business activity cooled this month, while a measure of prices paid for materials jumped, indicating price pressures are persisting. Meanwhile, gold (GC=F) also climbed to another fresh record high as optimism for Fed rate cuts grows. On the tech side, the spotlight is on Micron Technology's (MU) quarterly earnings due after the bell. The memory chipmaker's results will be watched for updates on AI-driven demand and revenue guidance, with analysts expecting an almost 40% jump in sales. LIVE 12 updates

'Mag 7' stocks sink after mixed performance Monday
The "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks — save for Meta (META) — fell across the board Tuesday. Nvidia and Amazon (AMZN) led the declines, with both stocks dropping around 2%. Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), and Tesla (TSLA) fell fractionally, while Meta climbed 0.3%. The fall in Big Tech stocks comes after the group saw mixed performance during the previous trading session. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) climbed to a fresh record Monday as the Nvidia-OpenAI (NVDA) deal boosted optimism that the AI-fueled tech stock rally has more room to run, with Nvidia itself climbing to a record close and Tesla hitting its highest closing price so far this year. Apple shares also jumped more than 4% Monday as Wedbush analyst Dan Ives set his price target on shares to a new high on Wall Street, $310, as demand appeared strong for its latest iPhone lineup. Meanwhile, Amazon and Meta shares extended declines from the prior day, when the stocks fell nearly 2%. Alphabet and Microsoft had also fallen by less than 1% Monday.

US manufacturing and services sectors grew less than expected in September, preliminary PMI data shows
The US manufacturing and services sectors grew less than expected in September, according to S&P Global's US Flash PMI reading. The S&P Global US Manufacturing PMI hit 52, below the 52.2 expected by economists polled by Bloomberg and the reading of 53 last month. Meanwhile, the US Services PMI was 53.9, below the reading of 54 expected and 54.5 last month. Readings above 50 signal expansion in the sectors. "PMI survey data are consistent with the economy expanding at a 2.2% annualized rate in the third quarter," wrote Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence. "However, the monthly profile is one of growth having slowed from its recent peak back in July, and September saw companies also pull back on their hiring," he wrote, adding to a larger narrative of cracks in the labor market. S&P Global's report on Tuesday noted a slower rate of job creation in the services sector, while the manufacturing sector saw job losses due to cost-cutting. Meanwhile, the report said input price inflation in the manufacturing sector remained elevated at one of the highest rates since the pandemic, and inflation hit its highest level since May in the services sector. "Although tariffs were again cited as a driver of higher input costs across both manufacturing and services, the number of companies able to hike selling prices to pass these costs on to customers has fallen, hinting at squeezed margins but boding well for inflation to moderate," Williamson wrote.

Nvidia stock pulls back from record high
Nvidia (NVDA) shares nudged 2% lower in early trading on Tuesday after climbing roughly 4% to a record close of $183.61 on Monday following the chipmaker's announcement of a $100 billion investment in OpenAI.
The partnership will allow OpenAI to deploy "at least 10 gigawatts" of compute capacity from the Nvidia''s AI systems — starting with its upcoming Vera Rubin platform in the second half of 2026 — to train and run the ChatGPT maker's next generation of artificial intelligence models. Thaequates to as many as 5 million of Nvidia's GPUs, Wall Street analysts estimated. CEO Jensen Huang called it "the biggest AI infrastructure project in history." Bank of America (BAC) analyst Vivek Arya said the deal could generate as much as $500 billion in revenue for the AI chipmaker. Still, Arya noted, "The optics of such large investment in a customer will raise questions until NVDA clarifies the appropriate accounting treatment." DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria also raised questions about OpenAI "making commitments well beyond its means." Read more in my story on the deal here.

Stocks steady at the open
US stocks held steady on Tuesday at the open. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) nudged up nearly 0.3%. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) both hovered near the flat line.
The largely muted start to Tuesday comes after the three major stock indexes hit record highs for a third consecutive trading session Monday as AI optimism was boosted by Nvidia's deal with OpenAI.

Plug Power stock extends remarkable rally
Plug Power (PLUG) stock continued to mount significant gains on Tuesday, climbing 11% in premarket trading. Over the past five days, shares have rallied 68%, including a 21% gain on Monday, as investors see a use case for the company's green hydrogen fuel in powering data centers and artificial intelligence. The company is also benefiting from a broader lift in clean energy stocks after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates last week. On Monday, Plug also submitted a prospectus supplement to the SEC related to the potential resale of some or all of its 185.4 million shares of common stock. The warrants have an exercise price of $2.00 per share and expire on March 20, 2028.

Kenvue stock rebounds after Trump links Tylenol use to autism
Kenvue (KVUE) stock rebounded on Tuesday morning after President Trump linked the use of its pain-relieving drug Tylenol to autism but didn't offer new scientific evidence to support that claim. Shares rose 4.8% in premarket trading after dropping over 7% on Monday.
In a press conference on Monday, Trump connected incidences of autism with women taking Tylenol while pregnant, which drew criticism from doctors and scientists who say that studies have not found a causal relationship between the two. "Overall, we see limited judicial risk following today's announcement, but there could be some impact on Tylenol consumption due to negative headlines," Citi analysts wrote in a note following the press conference. Kenvue stock has been under pressure since reports surfaced that the Trump administration would release a report on Tylenol usage and autism. Tylenol makes up about 15% of Kenvue's US sales.
