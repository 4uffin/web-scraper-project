Stock market today: Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq futures waver after another record-setting day on Wall Street

US stock futures wavered after another record-setting day on Wall Street. Futures attached to the Dow Jones Industrial Average (YM=F), the benchmark S&P 500 (ES=F), and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) slipped about 0.1%.
On Monday, stocks jumped, clinching their third straight day of record closes. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led gains after Nvidia (NVDA) stock soared on news the company would invest roughly $100 billion in OpenAI. Oracle (ORCL) also rose once the White House confirmed the company's role in a TikTok deal, and Tesla (TSLA) secured a new 2025 closing high.
In after-hours trading, shares of Kenvue (KVUE), the maker of Tylenol, rebounded following an intraday drop as President Trump held an event with Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on autism and taking the pain medication during pregnancy. Meanwhile, Disney (DIS) announced the return of "Jimmy Kimmel Live" to its ABC network. The show was suspended six days ago after the chair of the Federal Communications Commission threatened the company over comments the host made about Charlie Kirk's killing. On Tuesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to deliver a speech on monetary policy, and Micron Technology (MU) is set to report earnings. The main event for Wall Street this week lands Friday with the release of the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures index. Wall Street will be looking for signs that inflation isn't rising too quickly, which could threaten expectations of two more rate cuts this year. LIVE 1 update
