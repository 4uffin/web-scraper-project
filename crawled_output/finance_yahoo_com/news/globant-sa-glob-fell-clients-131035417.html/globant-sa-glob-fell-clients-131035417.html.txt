Globant SA (GLOB) Fell as Clients Postponed IT and Digital Transformation Projects

GLOB
Fred Alger Management, an investment management company, released its “Alger Spectra Fund” second-quarter 2025 investor letter. A copy of the letter can be downloaded here. In the second quarter, the equities rebounded significantly following a challenging first quarter. In this environment, the fund’s Class A shares outperformed the Russell 3000 Growth Index. In addition, please check the fund’s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2025.
In its second-quarter 2025 investor letter, Alger Spectra Fund highlighted stocks such as GGlobant S.A. (NYSE:GLOB). Globant S.A. (NYSE:GLOB) is a Luxembourg-based technology services company. The one-month return of Globant S.A. (NYSE:GLOB) was -14.30%, and its shares lost 70.76% of their value over the last 52 weeks. On September 22, 2025, Globant S.A. (NYSE:GLOB) stock closed at $57.49 per share, with a market capitalization of $2.53 billion. Alger Spectra Fund stated the following regarding Globant S.A. (NYSE:GLOB) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter: "Globant S.A. (NYSE:GLOB) is a global technology services company that helps businesses transform digitally by creating software solutions, leveraging AI, and providing cloud-based services. Its customers primarily include large companies across North America, Latin America, and Europe. Shares detracted from performance during the quarter after the company reported weaker-than-expected fiscal first-quarter results, as revenue growth missed analyst estimates. The revenue shortfall was mainly due to clients delaying discretionary IT and digital transformation projects amid macroeconomic uncertainty, particularly within its North American segment. Management highlighted that the slowdown in non essential corporate spending—especially on projects unrelated to core operations or required digital upgrades—was the primary factor impacting new bookings and revenue growth."
Why Is Globant SA (GLOB) Plunging In 2025?
A close-up of an experienced game engineer's hands typing a complex code on a laptop. Globant S.A. (NYSE:GLOB) is not on our list of 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. According to our database, 26 hedge fund portfolios held Globant S.A. (NYSE:GLOB) at the end of the second quarter, down from 31 in the previous quarter.  Globant S.A. (NYSE:GLOB) reported revenues of $614.2 million in Q2 2025, reflecting a 4.5% year-over-year growth. While we acknowledge the potential of Globant S.A. (NYSE:GLOB) as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.
