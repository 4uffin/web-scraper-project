information purposes only and does not
constitute personalized investment advice
or a recommendation that any particular
security, portfolio of securities, transaction
or investment strategy is suitable for any
specific individual. You alone are solely
responsible for determining whether any
investment, security or strategy, or any
other product or service, is appropriate
or suitable for you based on your investment
objectives and personal and financial situation.

professional regarding your specific legal
or tax situation.
