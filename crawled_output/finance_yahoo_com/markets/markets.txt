Forge Price is a derived data point that reflects the up-to-date price performance of venture-backed, late-stage companies. Forge Price is calculated by Forge Data based on a proprietary model incorporating pricing inputs from publicly-available primary funding round information, secondary market transactions and indications of interest on Forge and other private market trading platforms.
Forge Price is not a quotation, and does not indicate available supply or demand, is solely for informational purposes, and may rely on limited data.
