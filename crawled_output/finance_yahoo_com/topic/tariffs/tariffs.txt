Trump slaps fresh US tariffs on heavy trucks, drugs and furniture WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Donald Trump on Thursday unveiled a fresh round of punishing tariffs on a broad range of imported goods, including 100% duties on branded drugs and 25% tariffs on heavy-duty trucks, set to come into force next week.
Tariffs have been a feature of Trump's second term, with sweeping duties on trading partners ranging from 10% to 50% and other targeted levies on a wide variety of products, casting a shadow over the global economic outlook and paralyzing business decision-making.
The announcements, made on Truth Social, did not include details about whether the new levies would apply on top of national tariffs or whether economies with trade deals such as the European Union and Japan would be exempted.
