Trump announces a 25% tariff on trucks and a 30% tariff on furniture President Donald Trump on Thursday announced sweeping tariffs on various household products, including imported kitchen cabinets and certain kinds of furniture – potentially adding even more costs to a category that has surged in price in recent months. Trump also announced heavy truck tariffs and pharmaceutical tariffs Thursday.

Trump announces 100% tariff on imports of branded or patented pharmaceuticals from October 1 WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States will impose a 100% tariff on imports of branded or patented pharmaceutical products from October 1, unless a pharmaceutical company is building a manufacturing plant in the U.S., President Donald Trump said on Thursday. "There will, therefore, be no Tariff on these pharmaceutical products if construction has started," Trump said on Truth Social.

Trump says US will impose new tariffs on heavy trucks, drugs and kitchen cabinets WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Donald Trump on Thursday took aim at a broad range of imported goods in announcing a new round of punishing tariffs, saying the U.S. will impose 100% duties on imported branded drugs, 25% tariffs on heavy-duty trucks and 50% tariffs on kitchen cabinets.
Trump has launched numerous national security probes into potential new tariffs on a wide variety of products during his second term, casting a shadow over the global economic outlook and paralyzing business decision-making.
Trump also said he would start charging a 50% tariff on bathroom vanities and a 30% tariff on upholstered furniture next week, with all the new duties to take effect from October 1.

Trump’s Steel Tariffs Are Triggering Counterstrikes From US Neighbors Against China While the three nations are each seeking to negotiate with the Trump administration to reduce the tariffs of as much as 50% imposed in June on steel imported into the US, they’re also focused on boosting local demand to offset the drop in exports.
Mexico announced a plan this month to raise tariffs on products from China, including steel, to as much as 50%.
Canada has also implemented protectionist measures, and in Brazil, steel producers are calling on the government to impose further trade barriers to foreign supply.

Tariffs could weaken, but not yet reverse, the dollar's reserve status, research shows WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The massive tariffs proposed by President Donald Trump on "Liberation Day" in April put the U.S. dollar's role as the world's anchor currency at risk, while the administration's eventual climbdown to more modest rates has likely left it secure, new economic research has concluded.
The research found that the country's "exorbitant privilege," with the dollar's role as a risk-free asset drawing investment to the U.S. and allowing the country to borrow at lower rates, is tightly bound to open trade that couples the fate of other economies to what happens in the U.S.
Protectionism would weaken that connection and the benefits that go with it, with a tariff rate of 26% estimated as a tipping point that would allow competing currencies like the euro to become more central to the global economy, authors including Boston University economics professor Tarek Hassan, San Francisco Fed vice president Thomas Mertens, and Jingye Wang of the Renmin University of China, concluded from their research.

China signals that purchases of US soybeans hinge on tariff removal BEIJING (Reuters) -The United States should remove what China described as unreasonable tariffs and create conditions to expand bilateral trade, a Chinese commerce ministry spokesperson said on Thursday when asked if China would purchase U.S. soybeans.
China, the world's biggest buyer of soybeans, has yet to book any U.S. soybean cargoes from its autumn harvest, traders have said, opting for South American supply instead.
U.S. farmers stand to miss out on billions of dollars of soybean sales because of unresolved trade tensions that have halted exports to China.
