Trump tariffs live updates: Swiss drugmaker Novartis says it can withstand potential tariffs; TikTok deal reached as US and China seek to break trade deadlock Yahoo Finance is chronicling the latest news and updates on Trump's tariffs.

Novartis has stockpiles to withstand potential Trump tariffs, CEO says ZURICH (Reuters) -Novartis has increased its stockpiles of pharmaceuticals in the United States and is well prepared should its products be hit by President Donald Trump's tariffs, its chief executive said in an interview published on Saturday.
Pharmaceuticals are currently exempt from the 39% tariffs Washington imposed on Switzerland last month, although the industry is awaiting the outcome of a investigation which could lead to sectoral import duties.
The U.S. also reached a bilateral trade deal with the European Union in July, which includes a 15% tariff on pharmaceuticals, except for some generic drugs.

Microsoft hikes Xbox prices in US once again as tariff challenges persist Microsoft said on Friday it is raising the prices of its Xbox gaming consoles in the U.S. for a second time this year, as the cloud giant's video game division grapples with tariff-induced cost pressures, strong competition and uncertain spending.
The price increases, which Microsoft attributes to "changes in the macroeconomic environment," will apply to its current generation of hardware, with the one-terabyte Series S set to cost around $450 and the high-end Series X around $650 when the changes go into effect on October 3.
Xbox previously raised console prices in May in several markets including the United States, Europe, Australia and the UK, as U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs on imports from manufacturing hubs like China threaten to raise the cost of hardware and compress margins.

Oil Falls as Trump, Xi Jinping Meeting Curbs Tariff Expectations West Texas Intermediate fell 1.4% to settle just below $63 a barrel as traders rolled over positions ahead of the October contract’s expiry next week, adding to choppy trading.
Trump said he would meet Jinping on the sidelines of the upcoming Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, but there was little publicly said about China’s continued purchase of Russian crude supplies.
The meeting, which comes just a week after the US urged allies to impose tariffs as high as 100% on China and India, reduced traders’ expectations of incoming US secondary tariffs against China, a move that could inflame trade tensions and tighten global balances.

Miran wanted a bigger Fed rate cut because 'I don't see any material inflation from tariffs' New Fed governor Stephen Miran said Friday he favored a jumbo-sized interest rate cut at the central bank's policy meeting earlier this week because he doesn't see any inflation from tariffs.

Coffee Slides on Report US Lawmakers to Seek Tariff Exemption Futures for the premium arabica coffee variety fell as much as 6.5% in New York as the Washington Post reported that US lawmakers plan to introduce a bill to exempt coffee-product imports from tariffs.
The robusta coffee type, most used in instant drinks, also fell as much as 8.9% in London on estimates of growing supplies from top exporter Vietnam.
An exemption from tariffs could reignite trade between the US and top arabica supplier Brazil, said Hedgepoint analyst Laleska Moda.

There’s no ‘material inflation from tariffs,’ says new central banker Stephen Miran President Donald Trump’s widespread tariffs aren’t boosting inflation, so interest rates should be lowered quickly to prevent America’s labor market from deteriorating, Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran said Friday in his first public comments as a monetary policymaker.

Stocks Are Outrunning Tariff Risks as Earnings Expectations Rise Among the companies in the S&P 500 Index that provided guidance for their third-quarter results, more than 22% were expecting to beat analysts’ expectations — the highest reading in a year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence.
The improving profit outlook flies in the face of what many Wall Street pros had been expecting as the initial wave of tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump started to hit.

Organic food prices could soar as US imposes import restrictions and new tariffs on specialty sugar The price of most organic food could jump this fall because of new policies and tariffs on imported organic sugar, frustrating manufacturers who say the actions won't help sugar growers but could put some food companies out of business.
More than 90% of organic sugar used by U.S. manufacturers is imported.
The price of that product increased in August when the Trump administration imposed steep trade tariffs, and will rise even more when high-tier duties on most organic sugar imports take effect Oct. 1.
