Tariffs Will Hit Slowing U.S. Economy Hard in 2026, OECD Says Global economies will continue to lose momentum as higher tariffs take an increasingly large toll on activity, the research body said.
The Wall Street Journal • 26m ago
OECD Says U.S. GDP Growth to Slow Next Year as Tariffs, Lower Immigration Weigh on Economy The OECD on Tuesday raised its growth forecast for the U.S. economy in 2025 on the back of AI investments, but noted that tariffs and lower net immigration are taking a toll and would lead to slowing growth next year.

Europe to succumb to slowdown driven by tariffs, French turmoil, reports show FRANKFURT (Reuters) -Euro zone economic growth continues to hold up as Germany's budget largesse props up sentiment and offsets turmoil in France, but more weakness may be ahead as U.S. tariffs start to exert their full effect, key data showed on Tuesday.
The euro zone has been expanding quicker than economists had expected this year, sparking debate over whether the bloc is simply more resilient than thought and how much damage French political turmoil will do across the 20 nations.
But the underlying trend was mixed and suggested that the industrial rebound may be fizzling out, leaving services to support growth.

Volvo Cars to produce new US model amid tariff pressure STOCKHOLM (Reuters) -Volvo Cars said on Tuesday it will begin producing a new hybrid model in the United States by the end of this decade as the Swedish auto maker continues to adjust to President Donald Trump's tariff policies.
The new model, details of which have yet to be released, will be designed for the U.S. market and help Volvo boost the capacity utilisation at its South Carolina plant, the company said in a statement.
Auto makers worldwide are scrambling to rethink their production strategies to contend with President Trump's duties on foreign cars, part of his wider policy to boost U.S. manufacturing.

Full impact of U.S. tariff shock yet to come as growth holds up, OECD says PARIS (Reuters) -Global growth is holding up better than expected, but the full brunt of the U.S. import tariff shock is still to be felt as AI investment props up U.S. activity for now and fiscal support cushions China's slowdown, the OECD said on Tuesday.
In its latest Economic Outlook Interim Report, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said the full impact of U.S. tariff hikes was still unfolding, with firms so far absorbing much of the shock through narrower margins and inventory buffers.

China Floods the World With Cheap Exports After Trump’s Tariffs With access to the US curtailed, Chinese manufacturers have shown they aren't backing down: Indian purchases hit an all-time high in August, shipments to Africa are on track for an annual record and sales to Southeast Asia have exceeded their pandemic-era peak.
Indian authorities have received 50 applications in recent weeks for investigations into goods dumping from nations including China and Vietnam, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified as the information isn’t public.
Indonesia’s trade minister pledged to monitor a deluge of goods, after viral videos of Chinese vendors touting plans to export jeans and shirts for as little as 80 US cents to major cities caused an outcry.

South Korean president says US tariffs talks worrying FX market SEOUL (Reuters) -South Korean President Lee Jae Myung said negotiations with the U.S. on tariffs have stirred concerns in the foreign exchange market but he was confident the two sides will reach a solution, a statement from Lee's office said on Tuesday.
Lee made the comments during a meeting with some members of the U.S. Congress in New York on Monday while attending the United Nations General Assembly meeting this week, the statement said.
"President Lee said there is concern that instability can arise in South Korea's foreign exchange market during the course of tariff negotiations with the U.S. but the two sides will be able to find a solution that ensures commercial rationality," it said.

Vanguard bullish on US credit despite tariff risks still on the horizon NEW YORK (Reuters) -Top U.S. asset manager Vanguard is bullish on corporate bonds despite high valuations, and while it expects tariffs will continue to be a risk for the U.S. economic and inflation outlook, those headwinds could be offset by further Federal Reserve interest rate cuts.
Investment-grade credit spreads - or the premium over U.S. Treasuries paid by high-rated companies to issue bonds in the U.S. market - declined to 74 basis points last week, their lowest since 1998, as investors pile into the asset class to grab higher yields than U.S. Treasuries, and as a Fed in rate-cutting mode is expected to encourage economic activity by lowering borrowing costs for U.S. firms.
"Credit spreads are near historical lows, but healthy fundamentals, attractive all-in yields, robust investor demand, a proactive Fed, and low recession risk support current valuations," Sara Devereux, global head of fixed income at Vanguard, said in a note to clients on Monday, seen by Reuters.

Exclusive-Ukrainian Railways plans freight tariff increase to tackle debt KYIV (Reuters) -State-owned Ukrainian Railways has prepared a recovery plan that includes raising freight tariffs to help control its debt amid intensified Russian attacks and falling cargo deliveries, CEO Oleksandr Pertsovskyi said in an interview.
The company, which employs 170,000 people and dominates freight and passenger transport in Ukraine, has seen cargo traffic almost halved since early 2022, while operation costs are rising because of war damage.
If the recovery plan, which is under government review, is not approved, the company will need a 30-billion-hryvnia ($728-million) injection from the state budget to cover low tariffs, repairs and debt payments next year, Pertsovskyi said.
