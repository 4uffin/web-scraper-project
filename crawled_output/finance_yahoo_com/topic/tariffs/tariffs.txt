South Korea's Lee and Bessent discuss conditions for US tariff deal SEOUL (Reuters) -South Korean President Lee Jae Myung told U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent that trade talks with the United States should be "commercially rational" and meet the interests of both countries, the president's office said on Thursday.
Lee spoke to Bessent at the United Nations on the sidelines of the General Assembly on Wednesday, his chief secretary for policy, Kim Yong-beom, told a briefing in New York.
The meeting focused on the $350 billion package of investment from South Korea agreed in principle between Lee and U.S. President Donald Trump at a summit in July as part of a deal to lower tariffs against South Korean goods, Kim said.

US Sets Stage for Tariffs on Robotics, Medical Devices The Department of Commerce is conducting the probes under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, according to Federal Register notices.
Under the law, which allows the president to tariff goods deemed critical to national security, the department has 270 days to deliver its policy recommendations.
The newly announced probes expand the potential sectors that could be exposed to tariffs, as Trump looks to encourage domestic manufacturing in key industries by hiking the cost of imports.

US opens tariff probes into medical equipment, robotics, industrial machinery WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Commerce Department said on Wednesday it has opened new national security investigations into the import of personal protective equipment, medical items, robotics and industrial machinery.
The "Section 232" investigations, which were opened on September 2 but not publicly disclosed previously, could be used as a basis for even higher tariffs on a wide swath of medical and industrial goods including imported face masks, syringes, and infusion pumps as well as for robotics and industrial machinery like programmable computer-controlled mechanical systems and industrial stamping and pressing machines.
The probe asks companies to detail projected demand for robotics and industrial machinery and the extent to which "domestic production of robotics and industrial machinery, and their parts and components can meet domestic demand" as well as the role of foreign supply chains in meeting U.S. demand.

US implements EU trade deal, 15% autos tariffs retroactive to Aug 1 WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Donald Trump's administration said on Wednesday it was formally implementing the U.S. trade agreement with the European Union, confirming that a 15% duty rate for EU autos and auto parts began on August 1 and listing tariff exemptions for generic pharmaceuticals, aircraft and aircraft parts.
In a Federal Register notice, the Commerce Department and the U.S. Trade Representative's office said they have amended the tariff schedule to implement the framework agreement reached with the EU in July that lowers the Republican president's tariffs to 15% on most imports from the EU, including autos.

Tariffs and conflict causing major volatility in shipping industry, says UN trade agency GENEVA (Reuters) -The shipping industry is experiencing major volatility amid rising geopolitical tensions and disruptions caused by a wave of new tariffs, according to a report published on Wednesday by the U.N. Trade and Development agency.
Due to an increasingly complex and uncertain global trade environment, subdued industrial activity in major economies and weak Chinese demand for bulk commodities, UNCTAD has revised down its maritime trade growth forecast for 2025.
It now projects overall maritime trade volume to expand 0.5% annually, with containerized trade growing slightly faster at 1.4%.

Company finance chiefs say mood is lifting, but tariffs set to push prices higher, Fed survey shows WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. corporate finance chiefs say the confusion around trade policy that put a damper on the first half of the year has begun to lift, but that price increases are still in the pipeline and may accelerate next year, according to the latest Fed survey of chief financial officers.
The quarterly poll, a national sampling of 525 companies conducted by the Atlanta and Richmond Federal Reserve banks in conjunction with Duke University's Fuqua School of Business, found that optimism among CFOs improved and uncertainty around policy fell in the third quarter of the year, a finding consistent with the Trump administration's reaching final tariff rates for many of the goods and countries it had targeted.
During the first months of the Trump administration this year, confidence plummeted and markets were whipsawed by the launch of tariff and trade plans that included a massive round of proposed levies that were eventually rolled back but set an unpredictable tone.

EU Makes Fresh Push With US to Revive Talks on Metals Tariffs The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm responsible for trade matters, has proposed to eliminate or significantly reduce the duties.
