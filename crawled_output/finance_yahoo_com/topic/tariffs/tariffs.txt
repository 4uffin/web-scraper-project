Trump to expand tariff powers, sets 15% baseline on Japan Trump expands tariff powers, targeting imported metals and auto parts, while setting a 15% baseline on Japanese goods under a new trade deal. The post Trump to expand tariff powers, sets 15% baseline on Japan appeared first on FreightWaves.

Vanguard bullish on US credit despite tariff risks still on the horizon NEW YORK (Reuters) -Top U.S. asset manager Vanguard is bullish on corporate bonds despite high valuations, and while it expects tariffs will continue to be a risk for the U.S. economic and inflation outlook, those headwinds could be offset by further Federal Reserve interest rate cuts.
Investment-grade credit spreads - or the premium over U.S. Treasuries paid by high-rated companies to issue bonds in the U.S. market - declined to 74 basis points last week, their lowest since 1998, as investors pile into the asset class to grab higher yields than U.S. Treasuries, and as a Fed in rate-cutting mode is expected to encourage economic activity by lowering borrowing costs for U.S. firms.
"Credit spreads are near historical lows, but healthy fundamentals, attractive all-in yields, robust investor demand, a proactive Fed, and low recession risk support current valuations," Sara Devereux, global head of fixed income at Vanguard, said in a note to clients on Monday, seen by Reuters.

Exclusive-Ukrainian Railways plans freight tariff increase to tackle debt KYIV (Reuters) -State-owned Ukrainian Railways has prepared a recovery plan that includes raising freight tariffs to help control its debt amid intensified Russian attacks and falling cargo deliveries, CEO Oleksandr Pertsovskyi said in an interview.
The company, which employs 170,000 people and dominates freight and passenger transport in Ukraine, has seen cargo traffic almost halved since early 2022, while operation costs are rising because of war damage.
If the recovery plan, which is under government review, is not approved, the company will need a 30-billion-hryvnia ($728-million) injection from the state budget to cover low tariffs, repairs and debt payments next year, Pertsovskyi said.

Microsoft hikes Xbox prices in US once again as tariff challenges persist Microsoft said on Friday it is raising the prices of its Xbox gaming consoles in the U.S. for a second time this year, as the cloud giant's video game division grapples with tariff-induced cost pressures, strong competition and uncertain spending.
The price increases, which Microsoft attributes to "changes in the macroeconomic environment," will apply to its current generation of hardware, with the one-terabyte Series S set to cost around $450 and the high-end Series X around $650 when the changes go into effect on October 3.
Xbox previously raised console prices in May in several markets including the United States, Europe, Australia and the UK, as U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs on imports from manufacturing hubs like China threaten to raise the cost of hardware and compress margins.

Roche CEO, pharma execs to meet with Swiss government over US tariffs ZURICH (Reuters) -Roche Chief Executive Thomas Schinecker and other senior executives from the Swiss pharmaceuticals industry will meet with the government on Monday to discuss the threat U.S. tariffs pose to the crucial export sector.
Washington has imposed a 39% tariff - among the steepest of any country targeted during President Donald Trump's global trade reset - on goods such as watches and machinery imported from Switzerland.
Swiss pharmaceuticals are currently not subject to that levy.

Euro zone consumers cut spending on tariff fears, shun US goods, ECB says FRANKFURT (Reuters) -Euro zone consumers have altered their consumption habits in anticipation of U.S. tariffs, moving away from American products and reducing discretionary spending, a study published by the European Central Bank on Monday found.
Euro zone consumers, sitting on ample savings built up in the years since the pandemic, have been cautious in making purchases all year as uncertainty over tariffs kept key parts of the bloc's economy in limbo.
"In response to tariff-related concerns, consumers are altering their spending habits in notable ways," the ECB said in an Economic Bulletin article.

One-third of firms paused or delayed stainless steel orders due to tariffs, Outokumpu says (Reuters) -At least a third of surveyed companies have paused or delayed stainless steel orders because of U.S. import tariffs of up to 50%, while more than half are reassessing their sourcing strategy, Finnish steelmaker Outokumpu said on Monday.
Outokumpu President and CEO Kati ter Horst told Reuters the slowing global demand means current European Union import quotas are too high, and that she expects the European Commission to announce in October measures to curb imports of steel from rivals to protect domestic producers.
A third of businesses switched steel suppliers as of May, while the addition in August of hundreds of derivative products to the U.S. list of goods subject to the levies created uncertainty for equipment and machinery buyers, ter Horst said.

Turkey ends some tariffs on US imports ahead of Erdogan-Trump meeting ISTANBUL (Reuters) -Turkey said on Monday it had terminated retaliatory tariffs imposed in 2018 on U.S. imports ranging from passenger cars to fruit, in a sign of warming bilateral ties as President Tayyip Erdogan travels to the United States.
Erdogan is due to attend the United Nations General Assembly in New York this week ahead of a meeting at the White House on Thursday with U.S. President Donald Trump, who said he expected trade and military deals to be sealed during the visit.

Hardest-hit Vietnam risks losing $25 billion from US tariffs, UN estimates HANOI (Reuters) -U.S. tariffs imposed in August risk slashing up to one-fifth of Vietnam's exports to the United States, making it the worst-hit country in Southeast Asia, according to estimates by the United Nations Development Programme.
Vietnam was the world's sixth-largest exporter to America last year with $136.5 billion worth of shipped goods, U.S. trade data show.
Vietnam's finance and industry ministries did not immediately reply to requests for comment.

Novartis has stockpiles to withstand potential Trump tariffs, CEO says ZURICH (Reuters) -Novartis has increased its stockpiles of pharmaceuticals in the United States and is well prepared should its products be hit by President Donald Trump's tariffs, its chief executive said in an interview published on Saturday.
Pharmaceuticals are currently exempt from the 39% tariffs Washington imposed on Switzerland last month, although the industry is awaiting the outcome of a investigation which could lead to sectoral import duties.
The U.S. also reached a bilateral trade deal with the European Union in July, which includes a 15% tariff on pharmaceuticals, except for some generic drugs.
