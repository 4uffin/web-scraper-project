Key US Inflation Metric to Ease as Focus Shifts to Jobs Market A report on Friday is forecast to show the personal consumption expenditures price index excluding food and energy rose 0.2% in August, compared with 0.3% in July.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell pointed to a cooling labor market to explain why officials lowered interest rates on Wednesday for the first time this year, but he made clear that the central bank remains vigilant on inflation as President Donald Trump’s tariffs continue to work through the economy.
“It’s challenging to know what to do,” Powell said.

Stock Market Rally Risks Losing Steam as Economic Bounce Fades The S&P 500 Index has added $15 trillion in market value since early April and notched 27 records in 2025.
Its 34% gain over the last five months — led by a surge in Big Tech shares — is a feat topped in just four other instances since 1950, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The worry among some investors, however, is that the rebound has already priced in a range of positive developments, from easier monetary policy to the economy’s resilience in the face of tariffs.

Stocks Show Little Geopolitical Worry After $16 Trillion Rally Expected volatility in the US stock market is hovering around one-year lows.
All while Russia has sent drones into NATO airspace, Israel presses a ground assault on Gaza and Japan’s government teeters along with the one in France — again.
