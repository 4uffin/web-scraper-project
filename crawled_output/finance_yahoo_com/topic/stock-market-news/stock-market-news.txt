Chinese Savers Have $23 Trillion and Few Options Beyond Stocks The CSI 300 Index has surged more than 25% since its April lows, fueled by enthusiasm over artificial intelligence and easing relations with the US, which culminated in a call between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping last week.
The idea that China’s small investors will shift a chunk of their $23 trillion savings pile to the stock market is a tantalizing one for global firms, who are showing signs of returning after years on the sidelines.
“The pressure to save is fading,” said William Bratton, head of cash equity research in Asia Pacific at BNP Paribas Exane.

Key US Inflation Metric to Ease as Focus Shifts to Jobs Market A report on Friday is forecast to show the personal consumption expenditures price index excluding food and energy rose 0.2% in August, compared with 0.3% in July.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell pointed to a cooling labor market to explain why officials lowered interest rates on Wednesday for the first time this year, but he made clear that the central bank remains vigilant on inflation as President Donald Trump’s tariffs continue to work through the economy.
“It’s challenging to know what to do,” Powell said.

The hottest thing in the stock market is suddenly boring tech For bulls, the wild rally in a bunch of typically quiet companies that were founded before Mark Zuckerberg and Sam Altman were even born, demonstrates how unrelenting demand for AI computing gear is benefiting a broad range of businesses.
