Argentina markets extend stellar rebound ahead of expected Trump-Milei meeting LONDON (Reuters) -Argentina's international bonds jumped and stocks climbed on Tuesday ahead of an expected meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Argentine leader Javier Milei, extending the previous session's sharp gains.
The country's dollar bonds, stock market and peso currency all strengthened on Monday after U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said "all options" of support were on the table for Argentina, including swap lines and direct currency purchases from Washington.
U.S.-listed shares of Argentine companies also rose in premarket trading with Banco BBVA Argentina jumping 6% and Grupo Financiero Galicia up 2% while energy firm YPF gained 2.5%.

Wall Street Strategists Chase S&P 500 Like Few Times in History The record-setting advance has pushed the S&P 500 Index nearly 3% above the average year-end forecast among those tracked by Bloomberg, which currently stands at 6,486.
The gap underscores what a vexing spell it has been for Wall Street soothsayers as equity prices have surged past worries about President Donald Trump’s trade war and signs of a cooling in the US economy.
As a result, strategists at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Deutsche Bank AG and other firms have been struggling to keep up, with many boosting their outlooks repeatedly since the S&P 500 staged a surprisingly strong recovery from the drop unleashed by Trump’s tariff rollout earlier this year.

Micron Needs a Rosy Outlook to Justify Its Soaring Stock Price Wall Street is betting that Micron’s results will feature a strong forecast for its high-bandwidth memory chips, a key component of the artificial intelligence infrastructure buildout.
The rising demand comes as major companies such as Oracle Corp. affirm their commitment to spending on AI and Nvidia Corp. is investing in OpenAI to support more AI infrastructure.
As a result of this spending, typically sleepy segments of the technology industry like memory and storage have become an epicenter of AI optimism, with shares of Seagate Technology Holdings Plc, Western Digital Corp. and Sandisk Corp. all seeing massive September rallies along with Micron, which is on track for its biggest one-month jump since December 2009.

Fed's Bowman: Fed needs to be decisive in fending off job market risks WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Federal Reserve may be late in supporting the labor market and could need to speed the pace of rate cuts if demand conditions weaken and businesses begin to lay off workers, Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman said on Tuesday.
In remarks that laid out the case for putting full weight on potential problems in the job market and largely dismissing inflation risks, Bowman said the slowdown in hiring is such that "it is time for the Committee to act decisively and proactively to address decreasing labor market dynamism and emerging signs of fragility."
