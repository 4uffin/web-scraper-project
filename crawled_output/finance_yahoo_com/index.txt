Market Catalysts Nvidia-OpenAI’s $100B deal, top analyst calls, Disney brings back Kimmel
Kenvue rebounds as doctors deny Trump's Tylenol, autism claim Shares of Tylenol-maker Kenvue (KVUE) are gaining in Tuesday's trading session, recovering some losses after the scientific and medical communities pushed back on the Trump administration's claims that Tylenol is linked to autism. President Trump and US Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claim that using Tylenol during pregnancy is linked to autism. The product makes up 15% of Kenvue's US sales. Robinhood chief investment officer Stephanie Guild, Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Brooke DiPalma, and Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Ines Ferré take a closer look at what the recent claims mean for Kenvue and investors. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Opening Bid.
