US chip independence is a 'vital necessity': Gary Cohn on AI Nvidia (NVDA) announced a $5 billion stake in Intel (INTC) alongside a joint partnership in developing artificial intelligence (AI) chips.

International Business Machines (IBM) Vice Chair Gary Cohn sits down with Opening Bid host Brian Sozzi to weigh in on Big Tech's heavy investments and CapEx spending into AI and data center infrastructure. Catch Yahoo Finance's full interview with Gary Cohn by clicking here. Cohn also served as the director of the National Economic Council (NEC) under the first Trump administration, from 2017 to 2018.
