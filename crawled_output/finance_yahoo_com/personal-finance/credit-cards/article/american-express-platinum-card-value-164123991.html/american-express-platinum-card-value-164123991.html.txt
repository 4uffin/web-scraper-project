How much value do you actually get out of the new Amex Platinum?
Ben Walker (CEPF, CFEI®)

The Platinum Card® from American Express
Rates & fees,
terms apply Learn more
The Platinum Card® from American Express was recently refreshed with new perks and enhanced benefits, including a welcome bonus worth up to 175,000 Membership Rewards® Points (after spending $8,000 in the first six months) and up to $600 annual hotel credit on select prepaid hotel bookings through Amex Travel (up to $300 semi-annually).
However, the refresh also increased the annual fee to $895, so it’s more important than ever to review the card’s benefits, potentially worth over $3,500 each year, to see how much value you can get. Read more: Best travel credit cards New and enhanced benefits overview American Express added various new benefits to the Amex Platinum while upgrading a few existing benefits.
Enhanced hotel credit
Benefit: Get up to $600 hotel credit on select prepaid hotel bookings through Amex Travel (up to $300 semi-annually)
Usability: Medium
Potential annual value: $600
You can get up to $300 back in statement credits each half of the year on prepaid Fine Hotels + Resorts or The Hotel Collection bookings through Amex Travel. Using this credit depends on where you live and your travel schedule. Large cities usually have plenty of options for booking Fine Hotels + Resorts and The Hotel Collection. You can also use this credit to add a night to existing travel plans. Still, the fact that you have such specific requirements for this credit bumps its usability level up to medium. Read more: Best hotel credit cards Enhanced digital entertainment credit
Benefit: Get up to $300 annual digital entertainment credit ($25 back per month); enrollment required
Usability: Easy
Potential annual value: $300
If you use streaming services, this credit should be easy to use. You’ll get up to $25 back each month on Paramount+, YouTube Premium, YouTube TV, Disney+, a Disney+ bundle, ESPN+, Hulu, The New York Times, Peacock, and The Wall Street Journal. New Resy credit
Benefit: Get up to $400 annual Resy credit (up to $100 per quarter); enrollment required
Usability: Medium
Potential annual value: $400
This benefit lets you receive up to $100 back per quarter on purchases at Resy restaurants. From experience, you don’t have to use the Resy platform; you just have to make a purchase at a Resy-associated restaurant. We gave this a medium usability score because not every market has many Resy restaurants. This credit is much easier to use if you live in a big U.S. city or often travel to bigger cities. Read more: Best credit cards for restaurants New lululemon credit
Benefit: Get up to $300 annual lululemon credit (up to $75 per quarter); enrollment required
Usability: Medium
Potential annual value: $300
Up to $75 back per quarter on lululemon purchases should be easy to use because you get free standard shipping on online purchases in North America. However, we gave this a medium usability score because it may be difficult to find something you want each quarter, and you simply may not shop at lululemon very often. Related: Should you use credit card rewards for shopping or travel? New Uber One credit
Benefit: Get up to $120 Uber One membership credit each calendar year for an auto-renewing Uber One membership in the U.S.
Usability: Easy
Potential annual value: $120
This credit is easy to use: You just have to use your card to pay for an eligible Uber One membership. That doesn’t mean an Uber One membership is worth $120 to everyone; it depends on where you live and how often you use Uber. New Oura credit
Benefit: Get up to $200 annual Oura credit; enrollment required
Usability: Hard
Potential annual value: $200
You can get up to $200 back in statement credits each calendar year when using your card to purchase an Oura Ring through Ouraring.com. This credit is difficult to use because Oura Rings are generally more expensive than $200, and you must pay for a subscription to get meaningful data from your ring. Since this credit is specifically for buying a ring and not an Oura membership, we don’t see many people getting too much value from it, unless they can resell older-generation models. New hotel elite status
Benefit: Receive Leaders Club Sterling Status from The Leading Hotels of the World; enrollment required
Usability: Hard
Potential annual value: Varies
The Leading Hotels of the World is a luxury hotel collection with over 400 properties worldwide. This benefit is useless if you don’t plan on staying at any of its hotels. However, the Sterling elite status can get visitors a few nice perks over the Club status, including five pre-arrival upgrades per year and SIXT Platinum status. Additional credits These are existing credits that have largely remained the same. Airline fee statement credit
Benefit: Get up to $200 annual airline fee statement credit
Usability: Medium
Potential annual value: $200
To use this credit, you must select one qualifying airline, and then you can receive up to $200 in statement credits per calendar year for airline incidental fees, such as checked bags or in-flight purchases. It’s not the most challenging credit to use if you fly often, but it would be much better if you could use it on direct flight bookings with an applicable airline. Read more: Best airline credit cards CLEAR Plus statement credit
Benefit: Get up to $209 annual CLEAR Plus statement credit
Usability: Easy
Potential annual value: $209
This credit covers the cost of an annual CLEAR Plus membership, which can help expedite your time waiting in line at the airport. It’s very easy to use this credit, but it’s only useful if your airport has CLEAR Plus kiosks. Walmart+ statement credit
Benefit: Get up to $155 annual Walmart+ statement credit ($12.95 plus applicable taxes per month)
Usability: Easy
Potential annual value: $155 (plus applicable taxes)
This is an excellent benefit because Walmart+ comes with a free Paramount+ Essential or Peacock Premium subscription. So, whether you shop at Walmart or not, you can still get value. If you also shop at Walmart occasionally, the Walmart+ free shipping with no order minimum is nice. Read more: Best credit cards for shopping at Walmart Uber Cash
Benefit: Get up to $200 annual Uber Cash ($15 in Uber Cash per month for Uber rides or Uber Eats orders, plus a $20 bonus in December)
Usability: Easy
Potential annual value: $200
From personal experience, we’ve found this benefit very easy to use on Uber Eats pickup orders. There are plenty of restaurant options near where we live, so we treat ourselves to takeout at least once a month. Saks Fifth Avenue credit
Benefit: Get up to $100 annual Saks Fifth Avenue credit ($50 back semi-annually); enrollment required
Usability: Medium
Potential annual value: $100
This isn’t our favorite benefit because Saks Fifth Avenue is so expensive, and $50 in semi-annual credit won’t get you much, especially when factoring in the cost of shipping if shopping online. Fee Credit for Global Entry or TSA PreCheck
Benefit: Receive a $120 statement credit every 4 years for a Global Entry application fee or a statement credit up to $85 every 4.5 years for a TSA PreCheck (through a TSA official enrollment provider) application fee
Usability: Easy
Potential annual value: Around $20 to $30
This credit is easy enough to use and valuable. We’ve had countless experiences zooming through the TSA PreCheck or Global Entry lines while the standard lines move much more slowly. The nice thing about this benefit is that you don’t have to use it for the cardholder; it works when you pay for a friend or family member’s eligible application fee too. Related: Global Entry vs. TSA PreCheck: How do they work and which one do you need? Equinox credit
Benefit: Receive up to $300 in statement credits each calendar year on membership fees for eligible U.S. Equinox memberships or a standalone subscription to Equinox+
Usability: Hard
Potential annual value: $300
This benefit is so specific that it’s essentially worthless. There are so few Equinox locations that most people wouldn’t be able to visit regularly. As for the Equinox+ digital membership, Amex Platinum cardholders can get an annual membership for $300, but its value depends on whether its features align with your fitness goals. Other benefits We aren’t going to assign values or usability scores to these, but don’t forget about other benefits, like the welcome offer for eligible new cardmembers, the rewards rate, airport lounge access, and elite status with Marriott Bonvoy and Hilton Honors. A generous welcome bonus can provide more than enough value to offset the annual fee, at least for the first year. Read more: Best credit card sign-up bonuses and welcome offers
Is the new Amex Platinum worth it?
Learn more
The Platinum Card® from American Express
Rates & fees,
terms apply
Annual fee $895 Welcome offer You may be eligible for as high as 175,000 Membership Rewards® Points after spending $8,000 within the first 6 months (welcome offers vary and you may not be eligible for an offer); apply to know if you’re approved and find out your exact welcome offer amount – all with no credit score impact (if you’re approved and choose to accept the Card, your score may be impacted)
Rewards rate 5x points for flights booked directly with airlines or with American Express Travel® (up to $500,000 per calendar year)5x points on prepaid hotels booked with American Express Travel1x points on all other purchases
The Amex Platinum is well worth it if you can use many or all the benefits hassle-free. After all, it potentially offers over $3,500 worth of annual value for a $895 annual fee. However, our biggest gripe with the Amex Platinum, other than its huge annual fee, is that many of the benefits are specific and inconvenient. For example, the airline fee credit of up to $200 back in statement credits each year would be much better if it worked for directly booking flights on any available airline. But, it doesn’t. It’s purposely designed for incidental costs, such as checked baggage fees. The same goes for the enhanced hotel credit. It's great to earn up to $600 yearly ($300 semi-annually) in statement credits for hotel stays, but this only works on Fine Hotels + Resorts and The Hotel Collection prepaid bookings made through Amex Travel. So, it’s not like you can just pull up any hotel you want, book your stay, and expect to get your credit. That said, there’s still a place for the Amex Platinum in the wallets of people who can make it work for them, especially new cardholders who can take advantage of a generous welcome bonus.
