How do 0% intro APR credit cards work? A 0% intro APR credit card lets you avoid paying interest on purchases for a set period of time. This allows you to carry a balance without worrying about racking up any interest until the end of the introductory period, though a high balance could affect your credit score and you’re still responsible for making minimum payments. The intro period starts upon account opening and typically lasts 12 to 15 months, with some longer offers lasting 18 to 21 months. Unlike most balance transfers, you don’t have to pay a fee to take advantage of a 0% purchase APR. However, you still want to pay off your balance before the promotional period ends. Otherwise, interest will start to accrue.
What to look for in a 0% intro APR credit card
0% APR offer length: In general, the longer the intro period, the better. However, the average length of 12 to 15 months should be good enough for most people before the variable APR kicks in.
Balance transfer offer: Many of the cards on this list are also balance transfer credit cards because they have 0% intro APR offers on balance transfers. You can take advantage of these offers to transfer existing debt to one of these cards and not pay interest during the offer period. You still have to cover a balance transfer fee and you can only transfer up to your available credit limit.
Annual fee: We typically only recommend paying an annual fee on a credit card if you get enough value from the card’s benefits to offset the yearly membership cost. Fortunately, the best 0% APR credit cards don’t tend to have annual fees.
Rewards program: What are you supposed to do with a 0% APR card after the offer period ends? If it’s a rewards card, you can continue using it to earn valuable points, miles, or cash back on your purchases.
Credit requirements: Many 0% APR credit cards require a good or excellent credit score to qualify, which is at least a 670 FICO score.
APR: Most credit card annual percentage rates are high, so it’s typically not best to choose between cards based on the APR unless there’s a 0% intro APR offer.
Should I open a 0% intro APR credit card? It can make sense to apply for a 0% intro APR credit card for multiple reasons:
You have existing debt. You can use a 0% APR credit card as a way to help cover new purchases without accruing interest. This can give you some room in your budget to pay off existing debt.
You have upcoming large purchases. You can use a 0% APR credit card to make a large purchase and then take your time (during the introductory offer period) to pay it off without interest building. This lets you hold onto cash for other necessary purchases while still making interest-free payments.
It’s an emergency. This type of situation can vary, like being between jobs, but you can use a 0% APR credit card to make necessary purchases without interest accruing.
The important thing to remember is that 0% APR credit cards are still credit cards. When you use credit, you’re borrowing money from a financial institution that you have to repay, whether there’s interest or not. That means it’s still essential to responsibly use credit cards by making on-time monthly payments by the due date and not borrowing more credit than you can afford. It’s worth noting that carrying a large balance on a credit card, even during a 0% introductory offer period, can negatively impact your credit score because of high credit utilization, or the percentage of the total amount of credit you’re using. FAQs for 0% intro APR credit cards What credit card has the longest 0% interest rate? Credit cards with long 0% introductory APR offers include:
Blue Cash Everyday® Card from American Express
Chase Freedom Unlimited®
Capital One Savor Cash Rewards Credit Card
Wells Fargo Reflect® Card
Discover it® Cash Back
Citi Custom Cash® Card
Bank of America® Customized Cash Rewards Credit Card
U.S. Bank Cash+® Visa Signature® Card
Is it worth getting a 0% APR credit card? Getting approved for a new card with a 0% intro rate can be an excellent way to reduce credit card debt. The promotional period lets you pay your balance without worrying about interest charges, which is often better than alternative repayment strategies, such as using a credit card cash advance. What is a good credit score for 0% APR? You typically need good to excellent credit to qualify for a 0% APR credit card. That’s a FICO score of at least 670 and a VantageScore of at least 661. A higher credit score could improve your chances of getting approved for a 0% interest credit card. Do no interest credit cards hurt your credit? A 0% interest rate credit card can hurt your credit if your credit utilization is too high from carrying a high balance. You could also see a small impact on your credit score from applying for a new card. However, a 0% intro APR credit card could help with building credit over time and increasing your overall creditworthiness if you keep your card account active and make on-time payments.
Our methodology To find the best 0% APR cards today, we started with a list of all cards from major credit card issuers that offer an introductory 0% APR, which was nearly 30 eligible credit cards. This list did not include every available card from every credit card company. We added the cards from this list to a rubric to rate each card based on various criteria, including 0% intro APR periods, rewards, annual fees, and more. Our final list includes highly-rated cards, based on our rubric, experience, and expert opinion, that we think could make sense for people researching 0% APR credit cards.
