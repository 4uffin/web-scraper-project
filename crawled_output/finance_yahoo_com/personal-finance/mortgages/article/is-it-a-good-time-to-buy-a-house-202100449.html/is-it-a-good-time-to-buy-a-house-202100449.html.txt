Changes are slowly filtering through the U.S. housing market. Mortgage rates have been on a downward trend for weeks, sellers are discounting list prices, and active listings are up. Considering all of the factors that exist right now in the 2025 housing market — is it a good time to buy a house?

FAQs
Understanding the 2025 housing market There are positive signs of improvement. According to the Realtor.com August 2025 Housing Market Trends Report, there are indications that the real estate market has become more "balanced. " Active listings More homes are on the market. The supply of houses for sale has grown for 22 straight months — exceeding 1 million active listings for four consecutive months. Price reductions In August, more than 20% of listings featured price reductions, with the biggest price cuts occurring in the South and the West. Time on the market The median number of days homes were on the market rose to 60 days in August. That's above pre-pandemic norms for the second month in a row. The longer listings remain active, the more choice buyers have. The increased time on the market is likely triggering those seller discounts we mentioned above too. Mortgage rates In the past 12 months, 30-year mortgage rates slipped to a low of 6.08% in late September but haven't met that low-water mark again. According to Freddie Mac, the highest rate over the same period has been 7.04%. While that may not seem like spectacular news, at least interest rates are currently staying well below 7%. The Federal Reserve lowered short-term interest rates at its meeting on Sept. 17 — yet mortgage rates had already been on a mostly lower trend since the end of May. To navigate today's mortgage rates, consider:
More than half of home loan borrowers (56%) only get a preapproval from one lender. That reduces your bargaining power and limits the opportunity to find a better interest rate from a more business-hungry lender. Zillow research says that 45% of first-time home buyers who shop multiple mortgage lenders got a better rate.
Putting down a larger down payment can earn you a better mortgage rate.
Some buyers get below-market mortgage rates by negotiating a buydown or special financing from a seller or builder.
Take action: Use a mortgage calculator to determine the monthly payment you can afford. You can then learn the home price, down payment, credit score, type of home loan, and mortgage interest rate to meet your home-buying goal. Read more: How to get the lowest mortgage rates Home inventory New home construction has grown, with 1.63 million homes added to the inventory in 2024. Even so, the U.S. housing shortage is at an all-time high of 4.7 million units, according to Zillow's analysis of Census data. "The unfortunate fact is that we still don't have enough housing in this country for people who need it. Construction has helped prevent the housing deficit from ballooning, but it hasn't yet begun to close the gap," Orphe Divounguy, senior economist at Zillow, said in a release. Take action: If the area you love is too pricey, consider expanding your search to more affordable areas close to your favorite neighborhood. Dig deeper: How much house can I afford? Use the Yahoo Finance affordability calculator. New home sales New home sales fell 8.2% in July, compared to the same period a year ago, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. However, year-over-year inventory of newly-built homes was up 7.3%. Realtor.com expects 1.1 million new homes to be built this year. That's nearly a 14% increase over 2024 — with builders focusing on smaller, more affordable houses. Take action: If you want to buy a house now, consider a new construction home. You may be able to choose some finishes or make an even better deal on a spec home that's been on the market for a while. Is it a good time to buy a house? To answer the question of whether it's a good time to buy a house for you personally, you must look beyond broad market forces. Buying a home is more than considering macroeconomic factors. It's an important life decision based on your personal and financial situation. Where do you want to be in 5 years? When you rent, the decision to move is broken down into six months, or a year or two at a time, as your lease renews. But every dollar-related detail makes a home purchase a medium- to long-term investment. Buying a house includes various costs: the down payment, closing costs, and financing fees, moving expenses, property taxes, and perhaps selling the house you're in now. Homeownership requires a long timeline. How you make a living, your friends, family, and even community amenities all come into play. Your income A primary consideration: your job. Will it require a location change anytime soon, or can you live where you please? Is your income steady and all but assured? Your credit score One of the significant factors that will qualify you for a home loan is your credit score. It's important to know it before applying for a mortgage. For the most common loan, a conventional mortgage not backed by a government agency, you generally need a FICO Score of 620 or better. FHA loans can allow a credit score as low as 580 with 3.5% down. VA loans issued to qualified military service members and veterans don't officially have a minimum credit score, though some lenders will require a FICO Score of 620. Of course, minimum credit scores are the entry-level to qualifying; the higher your score, the better the loan terms you'll be offered. Most importantly, that can mean you'll pay a lower annual percentage rate over the life of the loan. You may also have more room to negotiate on fees. As a benchmark to where you stand, the median credit score on a new mortgage in the second quarter of 2024 was 772, according to the New York Federal Reserve. Learn more: The average mortgage rate by credit score Your current debt load A primary financial metric lenders will use to determine your creditworthiness is your debt-to-income ratio. Fannie Mae, a government-sponsored entity that provides liquidity to the home loan market, looks for a maximum total DTI ratio of 36% of "the borrower’s stable monthly income." Exceptions can allow for total DTIs up to 50%, but it's usually best to avoid working on the edges of qualification if you can. You can calculate your DTI by dividing your total recurring monthly debt by your gross (before taxes and other deductions) monthly income. Include debt such as monthly mortgage payments (or rent), real estate taxes, and homeowner's insurance. Also, add any car payments, student loans, and the monthly minimum due on credit cards. Remember any personal loan payments and child support or alimony. Do not include debt such as monthly utilities — like electricity, water, garbage, or gas bills — or car insurance, television streaming subscriptions, or cell phone bills. You can also exclude health insurance costs and miscellaneous expenses such as groceries or entertainment. Your savings Having a cash cushion in the form of emergency savings shows lenders that you are prepared for the unexpected. Of course, that savings account should also include … Your down payment A large chunk of your savings account should be dedicated to the down payment. A minimum of 3% down is required in order to qualify for a conventional loan targeted to first-time home buyers — or ideally, 20% to avoid private mortgage insurance. Yes, zero-down options exist if you are eligible for a VA- or USDA-backed loan. According to Realtor.com, the median down payment in the fourth quarter of 2024 was 14.4%. Dig deeper: Buying a house before the end of 2025? Here's what you should know. Your next move Buy smart and shop a lot. Relentlessly shop interest rates and mortgage lenders for the best loan offers and justified fees. Get a written preapproval from your lender, then shop for a house you can love and can afford. Your home buying competition is. According to Zillow, when it comes to first-time buyers versus repeat buyers, first-timers are more likely to reach out to at least three lenders and three real estate agents.

Is it a good time to buy a house? FAQs Should I buy a house now or wait for a recession? Mortgage rates tend to fall during economic downturns, so a recession would definitely qualify as a time when rates would likely drop. However, lower rates generally increase demand as more buyers enter the market, so house prices would likely rise. Buying a house at a time when both mortgage rates and home prices are favorable is a challenge. You probably shouldn’t try to time the housing market by waiting for a recession. Buy when it makes sense for you personally. Should I buy a house before rates drop? "Buy now" advocates might say that if you find the right house at the right price — and you're financially set — you should purchase the home now and look to refinance later. But what if mortgage rates don't drop substantially enough to justify a refinance in a few years? Only buy a house when you are comfortable with the terms you can get on closing day. Is it smart to buy a house right now? There are pros and cons to buying in today's housing market. For example, mortgage rates are still relatively high, but inventory is improving. Deciding whether it's a "smart" time to buy a house is less about timing the real estate market and more about evaluating your financial situation. Can you comfortably afford the down payment, closing costs, and monthly mortgage payment? Do you expect to stay in the home long enough to offset the money you pay up front? Then it could be a smart time for you to buy a home. Is now a good time to lock in a mortgage rate? Locking in a mortgage rate is a short-term decision, generally lasting only 30 to 60 days — sometimes up to six months. There's little reason to agonize over it. Be comfortable with the rate on your Loan Estimate and start packing boxes. Will U.S. housing ever be affordable again? Homes become more affordable as your income and savings grow. Ask any homeowner: Buying that first house was a stretch. The monthly payment loomed large. As months and years go by, it becomes less of an issue. Then, as home prices continue to rise, you're on the right side of the equation: The growing home equity builds your net worth. Laura Grace Tarpley edited this article.
