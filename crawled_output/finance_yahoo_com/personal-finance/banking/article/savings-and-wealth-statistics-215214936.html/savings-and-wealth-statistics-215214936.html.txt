When it comes to savings and wealth, digging into national data is one way to put your own finances into perspective. Looking at how Americans are saving, investing, and building financial security can help you see whether you’re on track, spot areas where you might improve, and set realistic goals for the future. Whether you’re curious about how much others keep in savings accounts, what typical retirement balances look like, or how wealth is distributed across the country, these figures tell a story about financial health in 2025 — and where you fit into it.
Average deposit account rates Deposit account rates vary widely across products and banking institutions. Here are some of the national average rates for deposit accounts, according to the FDIC:
National average rate for interest-bearing checking accounts: 0.07%.
National average savings account interest rate: 0.4%.
National average interest rate for money market accounts: 0.59%.
National average CD rates vary by term, ranging from 0.23% (1-month term) to 1.7% (12-month term).
Deposit account ownership and access
According to the FDIC, 95.8% of U.S. households were “banked” as of 2023 (the latest data available), meaning they held bank accounts — such as checking or savings accounts — with traditional financial institutions.
The average transaction account balance (which includes checking accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts, call accounts, and prepaid debit cards) is $62,410, according to the Federal Reserve’s latest Survey of Consumer Finances.
The median transaction account balance is $8,000.
In 2023, 4.2% of U.S. households (or about 5.6 million) were unbanked. The most commonly cited reasons for not having a bank account included not having enough money to meet minimum balance requirements, distrust of banks, and too many fees.
The American Bankers Association found that just 8% of people prefer to handle their bank transactions in person via traditional banking. By contrast, 77% prefer online alternatives.
Over half of banked households (55%) use mobile banking as their primary method of account access.

Saving trends
The personal saving rate (personal saving as a percentage of disposable personal income) is 4.4% as of July 2025, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Average savings vary by generation, with millennials saving the most money in 2024 and baby boomers saving the least.
The median retirement account balance in the U.S. is $87,000.
When comparing the average retirement savings by age, those aged 65-74 have the most savings, and those aged 35 and under have the least.
The median emergency savings for Americans is $600, according to a 2025 survey by Empower. Nearly two in five (37%) Americans say they couldn’t afford an emergency expense over $400, while 21% have no emergency savings at all.
Income and net worth
Real median household income was $80,610 in 2023 (the latest data available), representing a 4% increase from 2022, according to the U.S. Census.
The average American family’s net worth was $1,059,470 in 2022, according to the most recent Survey of Consumer Finances. The median net worth was $192,700 for the same year.
When we break down net worth by age, Americans in their 60s have the highest median net worth ($439,154), and those in their 20s have the lowest ($7,638).
When examining net worth by state, Hawaii's residents have the highest median net worth ($472,600), and Louisiana's residents have the lowest ($71,900).
Savings goals and challenges
According to a recent survey conducted by Yahoo Finance and Marist Poll, 47% percent of Americans cite the cost of living as their biggest obstacle to saving money.
Only 22% of survey respondents report being very or completely satisfied with their savings, while 35% are very or completely dissatisfied.
Forty percent of women are very or completely dissatisfied with their savings, compared to 28% of men.
Thirty-three percent of respondents couldn’t cover bills for even one month if they lost their income.
Nearly half (45%) of adults describe the cost of living in their area as not very affordable or not affordable at all.
Nearly half (45%) of adults report their income just about matches their expenses, while about 3 in 10 say their monthly expenses exceed their monthly income.
About 40% of Americans say they would cut spending when expenses exceed income, while 26% would dip into savings.
Most respondents (78%) say they know their credit scores, though 28% report they know a little to nothing at all about the implications their saving and spending habits have on their credit rating.
Fifty-eight percent of Americans say they know their net worth, while 21% say they do not, and 21% are unsure.
