Fed rate cut: How it affects your bank accounts, loans, credit cards, and investments
Hal Bundrick, CFP®
· Senior Writer, Mortgages
Updated September 17, 2025 4 min read
Finally. The Federal Reserve delivered a long-awaited quarter-point rate cut on Sept. 17. Wall Street expects two more rate cuts at both of the Fed's next meetings before the end of the year. Here's how the long-running interest rate pause has impacted deposits, credit, and debt so far. And what a rate cut could do for — or to — your money.
How a Fed rate cut affects checking and savings accounts 2025 has been a year of modest earnings on deposit accounts. A rate cut won't help. Checking accounts Your checking account is a money-in-motion machine. The convenience of liquidity limits your earning power. The national average of interest paid on checking accounts has barely budged much this year and remains at 0.07%. Imagine that moving even lower. Is it possible? Yes. Savings accounts Interest rates on savings accounts are only marginally better and are up a fraction to 0.40%. But savings accounts are for near-term money. High-yield savings accounts have been more effective interest payers. Rates are still barely clinging to 4%, with some financial providers slightly above or below that. This is one category where rate shopping really pays off. Especially as interest rates move lower. Money market accounts If you have $10,000 or more that you want to keep on the sidelines but are ready to put in play, money market accounts have been convenient — but low-paying. National average payouts remain at 0.59%. A better option might be a high-yield money market account, where interest rates are still near or a little better than 4%. What a rate cut does to CDs CD rates have crept slightly higher in the last month or so. A 12-month CD is averaging 1.70%, but you can find better deals if you're willing to take the time to hunt them down — and move your money online. Your minimum deposit and term will affect your rate.

What a rate cut will mean for mortgages and personal loans Home mortgages And then there are mortgage rates. Let's get this question out of the way: "When will mortgage rates go back down to 3%?" The quick answer: It's not likely anytime soon. However, mortgage rates have dipped mostly lower since the end of May and are at their lowest point in nearly a year. But the Fed cut may not be enough to significantly nudge them down much further. Mortgage rates are more influenced by the bond market, particularly the 10-year Treasury note. Its yield has already fallen nearly half a point since mid-July. That's the bond market pricing in the finally-delivered rate cut.
Housing industry analysts with the Mortgage Bankers Association and Fannie Mae predict mortgage rates to remain just above 6% through 2026. Personal loans Personal loan rates remain relatively high following several rate hikes by the Federal Reserve over the past few years. While the Fed dropped the federal funds rate a few times in 2024, average personal loan rates have only dipped slightly — from a peak of 12.49% in February 2024 to 11.57% in May 2025 for two-year loans. Most personal loans have fixed interest rates, meaning your rate won’t change if you’ve already borrowed the money. However, if you’re planning to apply for a new personal loan soon, expect rates to be higher than they were a few years ago. When the Fed rate cut, borrowing costs are likely to move down a bit further. Learn more: How the Federal Reserve shapes consumer loan rates

What happens to credit cards when the Fed cuts interest rates Credit card interest impacts everyone — except those who pay off their balance each month. Credit card rates have spiraled from around 15% in 2021 to over 21% in 2025. Credit card companies are clinging to the high interest that consumers are apparently still willing to pay. It’s possible two or three rate cuts by the end of the year will move the prime rate down and push the cost of credit cards lower too. Yahoo Finance tip: The best way to earn a lower credit card interest rate right away is to ask. If you make regular payments and have seen your credit score improving, it's a good time to call your credit card provider and ask for a lower interest rate. How the Fed's interest rate policy impacts your investments Stock prices often react to the Fed’s rate actions, but they are only one factor among many affecting the investing climate and stock prices. If you intend to manage your investments to suit the current environment, keep watch on broader economic and corporate profit trends alongside interest rates. If you prefer to stay conservative, fill your portfolio with high-quality stocks that have proven themselves in all economic cycles. Then, wait patiently for long-term growth.
