If you or your child is applying to college, there’s one abbreviation you need to know: FAFSA — Free Application for Federal Student Aid. The FAFSA can unlock financial aid to help cover the cost of college. In this guide, learn what the FAFSA is, the role it plays in receiving financial support, and what you need to know before applying.

FAFSA FAQs
What is FAFSA? The FAFSA assesses your eligibility for federal grants, student loans, and work-study. These funding options can make education costs more manageable and reduce the financial burden on students and families. To qualify for an award package from your school of choice, you must submit the FAFSA application by the federal deadline of June 30. However, there are both college and state deadlines for applicants to be aware of as well. Check the deadlines for your state on the Federal Student Aid site. The fastest way to complete the FAFSA is through an online application. You can also print out the application and submit it via mail, but that can take longer to be processed. For the 2026-27 academic year, expect the Department of Education to launch the FAFSA on Oct. 1, 2025. It's recommended that you submit the FAFSA as soon as possible, as some types of aid are first come, first served.
Understanding the basics of FAFSA Students are required to fill out the FAFSA to access any federal financial aid options, as well as some state- and school-based financial aid. In 2024, the federal government provided $120.8 billion in grants, loans, and work-study funds to more than 9.9 million students, according to the Education Department's Fiscal Year 2024 Annual Report. Students must submit an application every year, and dependent students will need their parents' signature along with key parental information to complete the FAFSA. The Student Aid page provides guidance on determining which parent to include and addresses situations involving divorced or widowed parents, adoption, or stepparents. If special circumstances prevent you from providing legal parent information, you can indicate this directly on the application.
Colleges review your FAFSA to assess your need level and eligibility for federal financial aid. They use this information to create a FAFSA Submission Summary, which outlines qualifying aid types, including federal loans, grants, and work-study programs. Colleges also use the data to determine your eligibility for scholarships or school-based aid. The aid you receive varies by college based on their specific formula (more on that later). Skipping the FAFSA application makes you ineligible for federal aid. While you could rely on family support or choose private loans, the FAFSA may provide free assistance options like grants and fixed-rate loans with strong protections. Dig deeper: Student Loans 101: Are federal or private loans better?
Students who take out federal student loans can choose to repay loans under an income-driven repayment plan (IDR), which reduces monthly payments based on your earnings. Additionally, there are opportunities for student loan forgiveness, deferment, forbearance, and death discharge.

Who can apply for FAFSA? Through the FAFSA, students can secure funding options to pay for higher education costs, provided by the federal government. Undergraduates, parents of undergrads, and graduate or professional students should all complete the FAFSA if they'd like to be considered for financial aid. To qualify, students must meet certain eligibility requirements:
Have US citizenship or eligible noncitizen status
Have a valid Social Security number
Possess a high school diploma or GED, or complete a valid homeschooling or eligible career program
Be accepted or currently attending a qualifying degree or certificate program
Maintain a minimum of half-time enrollment
Meet the school’s standards for academic achievements
Sign a statement confirming you’ll use funds toward education, are not currently in default, or do not owe money on a grant
If you meet and maintain the above requirements, you can apply for FAFSA and obtain federal financial aid. What info do you need for the FAFSA application? As part of filling out the FAFSA application, you’ll be asked to provide some personal and financial information. You’ll need to provide:
Full name
Current address
Date of birth
Social Security number
Contact information
Alien registration number, if applicable
Information about total assets
Untaxed income
Tax data
Whether you’re a dependent or independent student
Household size
Number of household members in college
If you're a dependent student, as most undergraduates are, your parent will also need to provide similar info about themselves.
StudentAid.gov
How to complete the FAFSA You can fill out the FAFSA online at FAFSA.gov or submit a paper version via mail. It’s recommended that you complete the application online, as it offers faster processing and access to the IRS Data Retrieval Tool. Here are the steps required to complete the FAFSA. Step 1: Create an FSA ID If it's your first time submitting the FAFSA, create an FSA ID. This allows applicants to sign the FAFSA electronically, sign your Master Promissory Note (MPN) for loans, and take part in loan counseling. You’ll be required to provide your Social Security number and email address to create an account. Dependent students should also have a parent create a separate FSA ID for themselves. Step 2: Compile information and documents Use the list above to gather all the information and documents you need to fill out the FAFSA. Have your tax returns and current asset balances handy. Depending on your situation, you may need information from your parents or spouse as well. Step 3: Fill out the FAFSA Next, complete the application. You can expect the process to take roughly half an hour. By submitting your application online, you may qualify to use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool. This tool helps you easily access your tax data and import it into the FAFSA. In addition, you’ll be asked to list the colleges where you’d like to send your FAFSA application. Award packages vary by school. You must list a minimum of one school and up to 20 for online applications. If you want to add more, you can do so later. Currently, the FAFSA has a little less than 50 questions, though some have multiple steps. Step 4: Submit the FAFSA After completing the FAFSA, review everything and then get ready to submit. Before doing so, you’ll need to sign the application (in addition to a parent, if applicable). The easiest way is to use your FSA ID, which allows you to do this electronically. By submitting online, you can ensure fast processing, which typically takes between one and three days. If you submit it via mail, it can take seven to 10 days. Step 5: Review status You can keep tabs on your FAFSA status. After a few days, go to FASFA.gov and use your FSA ID to log in. If you see “Processed,” you’re good to go. If it’s “In Progress,” you can check back later. You might also see “Action Required." If you need to take further action, contact the school to see about next steps. Step 6: Check your FAFSA Submission Summary You’ll receive a FAFSA Submission Summary within a few days. The summary outlines the information you provided in the FAFSA. Double-check that everything is correct. If there are any errors, make corrections ASAP. You can do so by logging into your account on FASFA.gov with your FSA ID. From there, go to “My FAFSA” and then “Make Corrections.” Correct the errors and submit again. Your FAFSA Submission Summary will show:
Student Aid Index, which is an index number used by schools to calculate what aid you are eligible for
If further verification is required
It’s important to note that the amounts in your FAFSA Submission Summary are estimates and may differ from your final award package from your school. The schools you included in the FAFSA will be able to access your FAFSA Submission Summary and determine your eligibility for federal financial aid. Most schools will send a formal aid offer only after they accept the student for admission. FAFSA mistakes to avoid Though the FAFSA asks many questions and may take some time, qualifying for federal financial aid is worth the effort. But making a mistake when applying can delay the process. Here are some top FAFSA mistakes to avoid.
Not creating an FSA ID for you and your parents: An FSA ID can help expedite the process and allow you to sign your online application. Dependent students must have a parent create a separate FSA ID as well.
Entering the wrong identification information: When you start the FAFSA, you’ll be asked if you're the student, parent, or preparer. Make sure to select the correct option to have some of your data entered into the application and avoid potential trouble.
Missing important deadlines: The FAFSA can get tricky, as there are three deadlines you need to be aware of — federal, state, and college deadlines.
Not including all the schools you’re interested in: Schools play a major role in the aid you receive, so list all the schools you’re applying to.
Skipping the IRS Data Retrieval Tool: The DRT helps you avoid the hassle of inputting information and can do the heavy lifting for you. If you're eligible, use the DRT to streamline the process and avoid typos.
FAFSA factors and formulas When calculating your eligibility for federal aid, the factors that are considered include:
Cost of attendance (COA) for the particular school, which includes total estimated costs for the year
Student Aid Index (SAI), which considers your family's financial resources and minimum living expenses to determine how much funding could potentially go toward college costs
Need-based aid uses the following formula: Cost of attendance – Expected family contribution = Financial need
If you qualify for need-based aid, you may be eligible for a federal Pell Grant, federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG), Direct Subsidized Loan, or federal Work-Study. If you receive grants, you typically don’t have to pay them back like you do with loans. Direct Subsidized Loans must be repaid, but come with one major perk: The government covers the interest while you’re in school as well as during your grace period after graduation. Work-study provides students with the opportunity to work part-time while in school. These jobs can be on or off campus and provide income to help pay for expenses. Non-need-based aid uses the following formula: Cost of attendance – Financial aid awarded = Eligibility for non-need-based aid
Based on this formula, you can qualify for Direct Unsubsidized Loans, federal PLUS Loans, and Teacher Education Access for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants. Direct Unsubsidized Loans require repayment and accrue interest immediately. PLUS loans are offered to graduate students or parents. TEACH grants are unique in that they require a service obligation, where you must work a minimum number of years at an eligible school. If that requirement isn’t met, the grant becomes a loan the recipient must pay back. What are special circumstances for FAFSA? As part of the FAFSA, you’re asked about your financial situation. The application uses prior-prior year (PPY) for income verification. In other words, for the 2026-2027 application, tax returns from 2024 are used (i.e., two years before). A lot can happen in that time, and your or your family's current financial situation may be vastly different. For example, if you’ve been laid off or experienced a reduction in income, you may be eligible to have your financial aid adjusted. In that case, once your FAFSA is submitted, reach out to the financial aid office at the school you plan to attend to discuss the changes in your financial situation. Other situations may make you eligible for a financial aid adjustment; this isn’t guaranteed, but it’s worth contacting the financial aid office. Such events include:
Parental death or divorce
Homelessness
Refugee status
Parental abuse or abandonment
Some of these situations may also allow for a dependency override. In other words, it allows financial aid administrators to change your dependency status based on "unusual circumstances." You’ll need to submit an appeal letter and include any supporting documents. Discuss this option with a financial aid administrator to see about updating your award package. FAFSA renewal and updates The FAFSA isn’t a one-time thing; it must be renewed each school year by the appropriate deadlines. The good news is that most of your information is transferred over from the previous year. However, it’s your job to make any updates if there have been changes, such as a loss of income. You can renew your FAFSA by logging into your Student Aid account using your FSA ID. Under “My FAFSA,” you can find “Renew my FAFSA form.” From there, you can make the appropriate updates, sign, and submit. If you miss the FAFSA submission or renewal deadlines, it could impact the aid you receive. It may even make you ineligible for any aid. If your school allows for a late filing and some aid, the amount may be lower than expected. When is FAFSA due?
One of the most important questions is, “When is FAFSA due?” The answer isn’t as straightforward, as there are three deadlines to be aware of for FAFSA:
Federal deadline
College deadline
State deadline
The FAFSA application is typically available every year starting Oct. 1, and the federal submission deadline is June 30. FAFSA launched Oct. 1, 2024, for the 2025-2026 school year. For the 2025-2026 school year, you must submit the application by June 30, 2026. For the 2026-2027 school year, you must submit the application no later than June 30, 2027. College deadlines can vary, so check with your school(s) of choice for deadlines. You can review state deadlines — some states have deadlines listed, while others require you to contact the financial aid office. Filling out the application shortly after it’s available to ensure you qualify for financial aid is ideal. If you miss the deadline, you could jeopardize your award options. FAFSA FAQs What if FAFSA doesn’t cover everything? If you’ve filled out the FAFSA and your award package doesn’t cover all your costs, you have a few options. Start by contacting your school's financial aid office to see if there’s additional aid available. Look into other scholarships and grants as well as work opportunities. Additionally, if all other options still aren't enough, you can look into private student loans. How much is too much income for FAFSA? Income is one of many factors used to determine financial aid and must be reported in the FAFSA. If you think you or your family earn too much, it’s important to be aware that there isn’t an income cap for aid. You may not receive need-based aid, but you could still qualify for federal student loans. Who can help me with the FAFSA? If you need extra support to complete the FAFSA, you can reach out to the Federal Student Aid Information Center (FSAIC). You can call 800-433-3243, send an email, or use the Live Chat function. When is the FAFSA deadline for the 2025-26 school year? The FAFSA federal deadline is June 30, 2026. However, you may have different FAFSA deadlines for both your state and college. Be sure to review all three deadlines to make sure you submit your application on time.
