Spot rating: 4.4 out of 5 stars
Best for: Range of coverage Spot earned one of our highest ratings thanks to its wide range of benefits built into the base plan. While some pet insurers charge extra for coverage for treatments such as behavioral or alternative therapy, Spot includes them up-front. Monthly premiums are above average, but if you want a pet insurance policy that doesn’t cut corners on coverage, Spot is worth a serious look.

What does Spot pet insurance cover? Spot has a standard accident and illness plan, an accident-only plan, plus two wellness plans. Its accident and illness policy has one of the most robust coverage options on the market without requiring you to add a bunch of riders. Learn more: Your guide to what pet insurance covers Spot’s accident and illness policy Coverage under Spot’s policy includes:
The vet exam free
Exams and diagnostics such as X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs
Hereditary and congenital conditions
Dental accidents and illnesses, such as periodontal disease and tooth extractions
Behavioral therapy for issues like aggression, separation anxiety, and excessive licking, when prescribed by a vet or animal behaviorist
Alternative therapies like acupuncture, hydrotherapy, and chiropractic care
Prescription medications and pet food or supplements used to treat covered conditions
Stem cell therapy
End-of-life care, including euthanasia and associated expenses
Microchip implantation by a vet
Spot’s accident-only plan If you don’t need illness coverage, Spot offers an accident-only plan that can help with sudden vet bills related to unexpected injuries. Coverage typically includes:
Emergency vet visits and hospitalization after accidents
Treatment for injuries like broken bones, wounds, swallowed objects, or toxic ingestions
Surgery, medical supplies, and prescription medications related to an accident
X-rays, MRIs, CT scans, and other diagnostic tests
Vet exam fees for covered accidents
Microchipping
This plan does not cover any illnesses, preventive care, or chronic conditions. It’s geared toward active pets or pet parents who are mostly worried about traumatic events, like falls, car accidents, or surprise injuries from outdoor adventures. This policy has the same 14-day waiting period as Spot’s accident and illness plan, and is available for both cats and dogs. Spot’s pet wellness plan Spot offers two preventive care add-ons — Gold and Platinum — that you can tack onto either base plan for an additional monthly fee. These help pay for routine care expenses. Depending on the tier you choose, coverage may include:
Wellness exams and dental cleanings (up to $50 per service)
Vaccinations and titers, including rabies, DHLPP, and Bordetella
Flea, tick, and heartworm prevention
Screenings and diagnostic tests like fecal exams, urinalysis, and bloodwork
Spaying and neutering (Platinum plan only)
Microchipping
Coverage is capped per service, so you’ll want to check Spot’s benefit schedule to see the maximum reimbursement for each item. If your vet charges more, you’ll need to pay the difference. Learn more: Why a pet wellness plan is worth considering Does Spot cover preexisting conditions? Like most pet insurers, Spot does not cover preexisting conditions, which Spot defines as any “illness, disease, injury, or change to your pet's health that first occurs or shows symptoms before coverage is effective or during a waiting period.” However, Spot does make an important exception: If a preexisting condition is curable and your pet has been symptom-free and treatment-free for at least 180 days, it can be eligible for coverage again. This does not apply to knee or ligament conditions, which are permanently excluded once they occur, even if your pet recovers. Learn more: Pet insurance that covers preexisting conditions Does Spot pet insurance include access to a 24/7 vet telehealth line? Yes, all Spot policies include access to a 24/7 vet helpline. You can call anytime to get advice from vet telehealth specialists, whether you’re dealing with a late-night emergency or just unsure if your pet’s symptoms warrant a trip to the clinic. What does Spot pet insurance not cover? Spot offers excellent broad coverage, but like all pet insurers, it excludes certain types of care and situations. What’s not covered includes:
Preexisting conditions, including any conditions where symptoms started before your policy effective date or during the waiting period
Routine care, preventive services, and vaccinations (unless you’ve added a wellness plan)
Cosmetic or elective procedures like ear cropping, claw removal, or tail docking
Grooming services such as nail trims and ear cleanings
Herbal treatments, CBD products, and most supplements used for general wellness
Dental cleanings (unless tied to a an illness covered by the policy or added via a wellness plan)
Breeding, pregnancy, and nursing-related care
Injuries caused by neglect, abuse, or organized fighting
Vet expenses related to racing, guarding, or law enforcement use
Endodontic or orthodontic dental procedures like caps, crowns, root canals, or implants
Travel costs, house calls, or non-veterinary services (like paperwork or membership fees)
Can I increase or decrease my coverage during the policy term? You may be able to request a policy change mid-term, but any change is subject to underwriting approval. And depending on the change, it might trigger a new enrollment, which means new waiting periods will apply and preexisting condition rules will reset. Thus, existing medical issues could become excluded from coverage as new preexisting conditions. If you’re considering a change, it’s best to contact Spot to ask how an adjustment would affect your specific coverage. How much does Spot pet insurance cost? Spot’s premiums are higher than average for both $5,000 and unlimited annual coverage. However, keep in mind a Spot policy includes robust benefits. Learn more: How much does pet insurance cost? Average pet insurance costs for a $5,000 annual limit Spot’s average monthly cost for a $5,000 annual limit is 7% higher than the overall average in our evaluation.
Average pet insurance costs for unlimited annual coverage For unlimited annual coverage, Spot comes in at 40% higher than the overall average in our analysis.
Learn more: How to compare pet insurance quotes Does Spot have a multi-pet discount? Yes, Spot offers a 10% multi-pet discount when you insure more than one pet. Some pet insurance companies offer only 5% or no discount at all. The discount helps lower your total cost, but since each pet will be on their own policy they will have their own deductible and annual limit. For a shared deductible and annual limit for up to three pets, check out MetLife’s family plan for pet insurance. Can Spot pet insurance pay the vet directly? No, Spot does not have an official system for paying vets directly. Like most pet insurers, you’ll typically need to pay up-front, then submit your claim for reimbursement. That said, if you’re facing a very large vet bill (like for surgery) it’s worth asking Spot ahead of time if an arrangement can be made for a direct vet payment. Learn more: Pet insurance that pays the vet directly: How does it work? How to file a claim with Spot Submitting a claim with Spot is straightforward:
Gather your documents. You’ll need a completed claim form, an itemized invoice from your vet, and a description of your pet’s condition and treatment.
Submit your claim. You can file a claim online or through the Spot mobile app.
Follow up if needed. Spot may request additional medical records or proof of identity for your pet. If anything’s missing, they’ll ask you to resubmit your claim with the required information.
How long do I have to submit claims for Spot pet insurance? Spot gives you 270 days from the date of treatment to submit your claim. That’s nearly nine months — much longer than the 90 to 180-day limit most pet insurers use. How fast does Spot pay claims? Spot says most standard claims are processed in five to seven business days, while preventive care claims are usually handled in about two business days. To avoid delays, make sure your claim includes all required documents, like itemized invoices and medical records. If something’s missing, Spot may pause processing until they receive it. Spot’s mobile app Spot’s mobile app lets you manage your policy from your phone. You can:
Submit and track claims
Access your policy documents
View claim history and reimbursement status
Contact customer support
Access the 24/7 vet helpline
Spot’s mobile app ratings: Spot’s app generally gets above-average or average ratings from users.
App store: 3.7 out of 5 stars
Google Play store: 3.1 out of 5 stars

Learn more: The best pet insurance companies Spot pet insurance FAQs Where is Spot pet insurance available? Spot pet insurance is available in all 50 states, plus Washington, D.C. Is Spot pet insurance covered by all veterinarians? You can use Spot pet insurance for expenses incurred in the U.S., its territories, and Canada. The veterinarian does not need to take Spot pet insurance because you’ll pay the vet and then submit the bill to Spot for reimbursement. Does Spot require an exam? No. Spot does not require a recent veterinary exam to enroll in coverage. But if you file a claim, you may be asked to provide past medical records, especially for your first claim. How do I contact Spot customer service? You can reach Spot’s customer support team by phone at 1-800-905-1595. Hours are weekdays from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. ET and Saturdays from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET. You can also contact customer support through the Spot mobile app. How do I cancel a Spot policy? You can cancel a Spot policy at any time by contacting the company via phone, email, mail, or fax. Let them know the date you want the cancellation to take effect. If you cancel within the first 30 days and haven’t submitted a claim, you’ll receive a full refund of your premium. If you’ve already submitted a claim, or you cancel after 30 days, Spot will issue a pro-rated refund for any unused premium you’ve paid for beyond your last date of coverage. Amy Danise and Tim Manni edited this article. Methodology We researched the coverage details and prices for 15 pet insurance plans. We then weighted categories, and each pet insurer was scored relative to the others to find the best pet insurance companies. Here are the factors we incorporated. Coverage types: 40% of score. We examined the coverage provided by the base policy without the extra cost of add-ons. This encompassed coverage for alternative therapy, behavioral therapy, dental illness, euthanasia or end-of-life expenses, exotic pets, hereditary and congenital conditions, preexisting conditions, prescription food and supplements, veterinary exam fees, and advertising/reward for lost/stolen pets. Average cost: 30% of score. We evaluated costs in five states for $5,000 and unlimited coverage for a mixed-breed dog (age 1), a French bulldog (age 5), and a Labrador retriever (age 8). Unlimited coverage option: 10% of score. We gave points when pet insurers offered an unlimited annual limit (or a $100,000 limit), which gives pet owners the most robust financial protection possible in the event of a catastrophic pet medical issue. Direct payments to the veterinarian: 5% of score. We gave points to pet insurers that state on their websites that they accommodate direct vet payments. No special waiting periods for special conditions: 5% of score. We gave points when pet insurers have no waiting periods for special conditions, such as cruciate ligament conditions. Routine wellness plan: 5% of score. Companies that offer a routine wellness plan in addition to pet insurance received points. Multi-pet discount: 5% of score. We gave points when pet insurers offered a discount for insuring multiple pets.
