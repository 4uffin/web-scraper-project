How to survive on $20 a day
Yahoo Finance Video
September 17, 2025
Pick a place, go, and figure it out! That’s the advice of globe-trotting entrepreneur and YouTuber, Ken Krell, as he shares his journey to becoming an early digital nomad. After losing everything in the 2008 financial crisis, a trip to Thailand opened his eyes to low-cost living and the freedom of working online. He discusses challenges of cash flow, lessons in resilience, and how mindset shapes the travel experience. Ken stresses building a “freedom fund,” building long-term investments, and approaching travel as a taste of life’s “geographic buffet.” For full episodes of Living Not So Fabulously, listen on your favorite podcast platform or watch on our website. Yahoo Finance's Living Not So Fabulously is produced by Dennis Golin.

Speaker A
It's it's interesting. Um, I left the US in 2009. Um, I had been, I've been a real estate developer. I've been training real estate entrepreneurs and as an entrepreneurs as a professional speaker for 40 plus years. Uh, and had been a victim of the the global financial crisis. Uh, that's what the Australians call it. They call it the GFC. It sounds so much better than my life got. Uh, which was
00:30
Speaker B
Right.
00:30
Speaker A
Uh, but anyway, I I had a giant project in Costa Rica. It it went down. I had to going bankrupt. Uh, got sued by my investors. I mean it was just one giant cluster. And my my best friend was like, you know what? This is madness that you're living in. Why don't you just go to Thailand for a month and just chill. You can still run your online business from there, but get out of Dodge.
00:54
Speaker A
And so I did. and after about a month in in Bangkok and and around, I was like, this is awesome. I'm living on nothing. I had no money anyway because I mean, when you go bankrupt, you you have no money. Um, and it was like the best lifestyle ever with the best food ever. and I thought, there's something to this. Um, and that was really how it all began. I got back to the states, packed up what I had because I mean, I lost the house, car was taken, you know, all the stuff was going on.
01:28
Speaker A
went back to to Thailand and was and was traveling at like $20 a day. It was incredible. And I was hooked.
01:38
Speaker B
Wow. So, so we understand that a little bit. You you must have had some income coming in because you couldn't just go over to Thailand with with no money at all. Clearly you had $20 a day.
01:48
Speaker A
I was I was making money where I sold my body. That was what I did.
01:51
Speaker B
Yeah. No.
01:54
Speaker A
That's a that's that is a big business over there. Now it's called only fans. Um, but uh, no, I mean, I had, I did have an online business as well. I was I was doing some some coaching and some training and so on. It wasn't the biggest business in the world, but it was enough to cover, you know, the daily operations and you know, and mind you, I was still struggling. It was one day in in, uh, in Cambodia. I remember talking to, uh, to this one gentleman who'd been traveling for like 27 years. And, um, you know, I had like $20 left to my name. That was all I had that day. It was kind of freaky. That was all I had in the world. The good news is I was I was living at $7 a day, which included breakfast, Wi-Fi and a private bath. So, you know, it was okay. The next day money came, you know, things work out that way, but it was it was really that tight for me at that point. So, being in Asia where it's so inexpensive was a real blessing. It's something you're not going to do in, you know, Tokyo or New York or London.
