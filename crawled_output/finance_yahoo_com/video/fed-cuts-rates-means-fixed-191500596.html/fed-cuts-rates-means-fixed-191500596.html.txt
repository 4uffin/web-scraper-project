Fed cuts rates: What it means for fixed-income investors

Julie Hyman
and Josh Lipton
Wed, Sep 17, 2025, 2:15 PM
The Federal Reserve opted to cut interest rates by 25 basis points on Wednesday — the first rate cut of 2025. Charles Schwab chief fixed income strategist Kathy Jones joins Market Domination with Josh Lipton and Julie Hyman to discuss how this rate cut and future rate cuts this year could impact the bond market (^FVX, ^TNX, ^TYX). Jones also offers some tips for fixed-income investors. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination.
Video Transcript
00:00
Speaker A
given the outlook for the Fed, we have seen bond yields come pretty dramatically down over over the past month or so. And I wonder given now that dispersion of dots and what happens after today's meeting, um, what you think is priced in to yields across sort of across the curve, and what do you think happens from here?
00:30
Kathy
Yeah, going into this, um, the market had had discounted a lot of rate cuts, uh, over the next, uh, you know, 15 months or so, getting Fed funds down below 3%. I think that's um, you probably going to be reinforced today because of the signal that there are three rate cuts including today this year. Um, I think the problem that we're going to face as you go out the curve though, and you look at intermediate or longer term yields is that inflation is still high and the Fed actually doesn't see it coming down all that much. so they've got like unemployment kind of staying around this level, inflation edging a little bit higher for the next year or so, and GDP growth edging a little bit higher from where we are and it's kind of an inconsistent message to have and that I think can give you a lot of volatility going forward as you move out the curve, you know, 10 years and so, we're going to see probably a lot of movement there as the market adjusts every data point.
01:32
Speaker C
So Kathy, let me ask you for fixed income investors, they're listening right right now, Kathy, post this decision, what what advice would you give them?
01:43
Kathy
So we've liked staying in high quality bonds in the intermediate part of the yield curve since late last year. And that intermediate is probably the five to seven, five to 10 year area as an average duration. So if you're just too short duration, you're going to have reinvestment risk as the Fed lowers rates. If you're too long, you have the risk that either inflation doesn't behave as anticipated or, you know, you get a lot of volatility around all these sort of political events and and economic events that can have an adverse effect on inflation. So sticking in the middle gives you a chance to earn very nice returns with less volatility than we're anticipating in other parts of the yield curve. It's a good environment for bond investors. You're still looking at clipping a nice coupon, uh probably getting some positive total return from price appreciation. So it's still still a good good environment just um, not go too long or too short.
02:51
Speaker A
Well, and on the two short side, I mean, obviously we saw a lot of people get into cash over the past couple of years um with yields on things like CDs where they where they've been. Um, has that rotation out started? Do you think if people need to do it now if they haven't already?
03:13
Kathy
Yeah, I think if you're heavily in cash right now and it's you know, more than you would normally have in your allocation, then it there's still time. You're still looking at decent yields uh and I would do that because the Fed is cutting rates. So as those rates come down, you know, you're going to reinvest at much lower rates. So if you want to maintain the same level of income, you have to move a little bit further uh out in maturity.
