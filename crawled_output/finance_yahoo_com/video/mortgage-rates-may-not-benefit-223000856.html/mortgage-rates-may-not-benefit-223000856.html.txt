Mortgage rates may not 'benefit' from rate cuts, economist says
Yahoo Finance Video
and Josh Lipton
Wed, Sep 17, 2025, 6:30 PM
The 30-year fixed mortgage rate dropped to a three-year low on Monday, according to data from Mortgage News Daily. Realtor.com chief economist Danielle Hale joins Asking for a Trend with Josh Lipton to discuss the state of the housing market and mortgage rates, especially under the backdrop of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Asking for a Trend.
Video Transcript
00:00
Speaker A
Mortgage rates falling to their lowest level in nearly three years on Monday, dip into 6.13%. That's according to mortgage news daily. That's sparking a surge in refinancing, but the monthly cost of owning a home continues to climb. We're breaking down what it all means with the Fed cutting interest rates by 25 basis points on Wednesday.
00:20
Josh
Joining now we have Danielle Hale, chief economist at realtor.com. Danielle, it's all good to see you.
00:27
Josh
let's start with that Fed decision. Curious Danielle, what you made of it, what you think it means for the 30-year fix, just looking at Mortgage News Daily right now, they've got that at 6.22%, Danielle.
00:41
Danielle Hale
Yeah, thanks for having me Josh. It's great to be here.
00:45
Danielle Hale
So, we had a big decision from the Fed today, but as big as it was, it was also pretty widely anticipated. We know that the economy has cooled, especially the labor market and the Fed has had its foot on the proverbial monetary brakes for a while. It's not so much slamming on the gas, but it is easing off that break as the economy gets to a point where it doesn't need to worry perhaps quite as much about inflation and maybe needs to focus a little bit more on the labor market side of things.
01:21
Danielle Hale
Now what that means for mortgage rates is that we've already seen them come down much lower in advance of this decision today because it was so widely anticipated. I don't know that we're going to see a whole lot of additional movement lower because I don't think the Fed was overly uh forward-looking in its decision today and it's clear from the projections that there's a wide range of views on possible outcomes.
01:54
Danielle Hale
And the market has already baked in a lot of potential Fed rate cuts over the next several meetings. So, I don't think we're going to see a lot of additional benefit. The Freddie Mac data that that's out tomorrow was largely gathered before this Fed rate cut. So I do think we'll see those rates move lower, but as far as real-time rates that buyers or refinancers are going to get quoted, they're probably going to be roughly in line with where we've seen them uh for most of this week.
02:22
Josh
So, can we put a number on it, Danielle, as an economist, um, where would you forecast the 30-year fix let's say 12 months from now?
02:33
Danielle Hale
Oh, 12 months from now, I think we'll probably still be in the low 6% range. So, not a whole lot of additional easing. If we see more substantial economic deterioration, I could see us move down into the high 5%, but uh with a an economy that progresses, you know, bumps along, avoids a recession, I think we'll be in the low 6% range.
02:54
Josh
And low six, Danielle, uh would that spark meaningful activity?
03:01
Danielle Hale
I think so. We saw this roughly a year ago when mortgage rates got down to roughly 6.1%, almost exactly at this time last year. We saw existing home sales pick up as we moved into the later fall months and that uptrend continued all the way into the new year. Uh so I do think this is low enough to see uh some pickup in mortgage rates and already we've seen uh an uptick in mortgage purchase applications and also in refinance applications according to the mortgage banker data that was out today. So I do think we'll see a rebound in housing activity.
03:36
Danielle Hale
Perhaps not quite as strongly as if mortgage rates moved lower, but it is enough to to jump start activity.
