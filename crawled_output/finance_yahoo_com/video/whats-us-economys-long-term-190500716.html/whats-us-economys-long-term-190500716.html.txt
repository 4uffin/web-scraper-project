Video Transcript

Speaker A
So, all of that said, you know, our bread and butter here at Yahoo Finance is the markets and the economy.
00:04
Speaker A
Markets are doing great here in the US. Stocks are doing great. The economy seems to be doing just fine, which has defied a lot of the dire pronouncements about what this whole tariff battle was going to result in.
00:15
Speaker A
And so, going forward, I mean, what you're talking about, this remaking of the global order, does it seem like the US can kind of be fine even given all that?
00:27
Speaker B
But that's that's long-term. You don't care about the long-term, you're Yahoo finance. You care about the short-term.
00:34
Speaker B
You care about the markets, deficit spending is great. You're not going to have to pay for that bill, not in today's market. The US is great at the short-term, and we have a president that is great at the short-term. So I I I if I'm an investor in short-term markets, I don't worry about any of this.
00:48
Speaker A
Well, I mean, over the long-term stocks go up too, right? So is there anything longer term in the scenario you're painting that will eventually be an economic disaster.
00:58
Speaker B
Well, again, anyone that looks at America's trade deficit and the lack of benefits that are coming from it, long-term, you're not going to be able to pay for social security or healthcare. Uh that that's a long-term hit.
01:08
Speaker B
Um again, people aren't, I mean there are no Ran Paul cares about this. There are no other members of Congress that care about this because it's not a near-term concern. Um long-term, when you tell Brazil, the largest economy in Latin America, um that um you're going to hit them really hard uh not because they have a trade deficit you're running. You actually have a trade surplus with them, but because they're doing something you don't like, their Supreme Court with the former president in upholding their own rule of law, they are now hedging their trade with Mercasaur uh together with the EU, um with EFTA, with India, uh with China, with everybody else.
01:43
Speaker B
Long-term that means less trade with the United States. Long-term that means cost of goods will go up. That means there'll be less efficiency.
01:48
Speaker B
I mean if you're telling people that they're not as welcome at Harvard, um or they're not as welcome as immigrants in the US. You're telling South Koreans they're not as welcome. Um you're telling brown people they're not as welcome and there are a lot of very talented brown people around the world, then long-term, that's going to affect the American economy and the markets.
02:07
Speaker B
But again, the revealed president preferences of the US government and its leadership, Republicans and Democrats, are that the long-term don't matter. So we should just embrace this, especially on Yahoo finance and say, let's smoke 'em while you got 'em. I mean, that that is that is what capitalism today is all about in the US.
