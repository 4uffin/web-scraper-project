Video Transcript
00:00
Speaker A
Angelo, I want to finish by talking about a couple of other names that have been, um, you know, persistent in the in the flow here, and that's what we saw yesterday from Nvidia and Intel. Nvidia taking a stock in that company, Intel stock responding in kind. Uh, again, two interesting stories, but I'm curious specifically for how you're looking at, um, this kind of strategic role that Intel now seems to be playing in domestic US manufacturing. Uh, you know, Nvidia, its CEO Jensen Huang has certainly become one of the major, feels like corporate geopolitical players,
00:36
Speaker A
if that's a new term we're going to coin here. Um, and what you see in that deal, both for, you know, Intel trying to stabilize its business and Nvidia, I think, really flexing its muscle around how much influence it wants to have for, you know, the future of US manufacturing.
01:08
Angelo
Yeah, no, absolutely. So, you know, overall, it's it's definitely a net positive for both companies. And you know, the question is how much of a positive is it. And what people have to realize is listen, Intel now and this is all product-oriented, right? What people need to realize is there's no foundry uh revenue that's coming here in Nvidia. Um it remains to be seen whether or not they decide to take a piece of that foundry business or, you know, uh become that white knight for Intel. Our view probably over the next 12, 18 months is
01:43
Angelo
they start getting some token business on the foundry side, um start kind of, um, you know, seeing what Intel is capable of doing on that side. So, that's the big reason for the the the magnitude of the increase. Ultimately, listen, um the fact that Intel gets in on the the product side there, um, across Nvidia's ecosystem, um on the the AI server side is a good thing. But nonetheless, um the question is, you know, to what magnitude
02:22
Angelo
are they going to see a jump up in revenue and how much is that going to help the earnings leverage. Obviously, um all the the investments that we've seen, whether it be from the US Administration, Softbank, um and now Nvidia, it is all dilutive um to existing Intel shareholders. And I think um those shareholders need to recognize that. So, this is going to be a long tail, it's going to be a long story before we really um understand that the clear benefits here for Intel, and we do think they could potentially um reap some significant rewards
02:59
Angelo
from this greater partnership. But right now, um, you know, we just have to wait and see. But for Nvidia, this is a huge positive in the sense that um it gets them closer um to the the Trump administration, um gets them on their good side. And of course, you know, we're waiting on potentially a Blackwell uh version uh approval in um, you know, in China, which hopefully we get, but that's all going to be dependent on the uh the China- US uh trade negotiations.
