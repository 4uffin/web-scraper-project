3 Things: Powell speaks after Miran, Trump at the UN, growth upgrade
Ramzan Karmali
Tue, Sep 23, 2025, 7:00 AM
Jerome Powell is due to speak later today for the first time since rates were cut last week. On Monday, new Fed governor Stephen Miran called for steeper rate cuts. President Trump is due to speak at the UN General Assembly amid continued trade tensions and the fallout from the proposed $100,000 H-1B visa fee. Meanwhile, the OECD lifts its global growth forecast.
Video Transcript
00:04
Speaker A
Well, the first thing you need to know about is that the Fed Chair Jerome Powell will be speaking for the first time since interest rates were cut last week.
00:13
Speaker A
Treasury yields slipped slightly in anticipation of his remarks. Investors will be looking for more clues about the Fed's interest rate path.
00:21
Speaker A
On Monday, new Fed Governor Stephen Miron said steep rate cuts are needed, but St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem signaled he would be cautious about supporting further easing.
00:32
Speaker A
One of the key economic updates expected this week is the personal consumption expenditures or PCE index, the Federal Reserves' favored inflation measure, which should give a glimpse of inflationary pressures and the state of the broader US economy.
00:45
Speaker A
Now, the next thing you need to know about is that President Trump will be speaking at the UN General Assembly later today.
00:54
Speaker A
His speech comes amid ongoing trade tensions and the fallout from his announcement of a $100,000 H1B visa fee. Trade talks between the US with both India and China are still ongoing, the two countries most impacted by the new visa fee.
01:03
Speaker A
And the last thing you need to know about is that global growth forecasts have been lifted by the OECD.
01:10
Speaker A
It said the full brunt of the US import tariff shock is still to be felt, as AI investment props up US activity for now, and fiscal support cushions China's slowdown.
01:21
Speaker A
The OECD now expects global growth of 3.2% this year compared to the 2.9% expansion it had forecast in June, with many economies appearing more resilient than expected so far this year.
01:33
Speaker A
Growth expectations for the US were also lifted to 1.8% for 2025 compared to June's 1.6% estimate.
01:40
Speaker A
This still marks a significant fall from 2024's 2.8% growth.
