The Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 25 basis points at its September meeting on Wednesday — the first rate cut in 2025. The US central bank currently forecasts two more rate cuts in 2025. Mizuho Americas senior REIT and homebuilders analyst Haendel St. Juste joins Asking for a Trend with Josh Lipton to discuss how to play the real estate investment trusts (REITs) sector amid the backdrop of rate cuts. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Asking for a Trend.
Video Transcript
00:00
Speaker A
You figure Handel, uh, the Fed cuts, that's good news for REITs. Is it good news across the board or or no, you got to, you got to pick your spots, particularly in the, in the apartments and storage names that you know so very well.
00:23
Handel
Hey there. Well, uh, thanks for having me and yes, it's uh, it's been an interesting year for REIT in the aftermath of liberation day tariff, uh, flowing macro and now the rate cuts. So, uh the rets are up four or 5% of the year, but they're still lagging uh the S&P by about 1,000 basis points. But we've seen a good amount of dispersion within rets with the longer duration more defensive sectors like Triple Net and healthcare leading the way while apartments, storage, uh and retail have lagged. and so, you know, our work has shown that rate cuts uh can be good uh for
00:54
Handel
REs broadly, but there is, you know, some distinction between the different subsectors on how they perform. and so, uh as you alluded to, yes, uh we think that, you know, investors need to be a bit selective. We think long duration, triple net, spread investing, subsectors that are more defensive, uh, will likely continue to be uh relative winners. Uh, we've seen the apartments and storage lag. There's been some concern about, uh, demand and the slowing macro, the consumer pricing power and so, I think you have to be a bit more selective among some of those subsectors.
01:31
Speaker A
So, you got to stay selective, stay smart, do your homework. In apartments and storage, I am curious, Handel. I where where do you see opportunity?
01:43
Handel
Absolutely. So, I think broadly, look, I think in apartments, you know, we're in the shoulder months where the man is weak. It's been a bit of a challenging year for apartment landlords. They haven't achieved the pricing power that they wanted. So on top of, you know, the macro being a bit choppy, there's concerns about pricing power, but, you know, here we are going into slower time of year and all eyes are on 26 and I think there's a couple of names, uh Mid-America, MAA, Camden Property, CPT, which are trading cheaper than peers and which importantly have an inflection in their growth profile
02:14
Handel
into next year. Uh and that's important because historically that inflection, that improving second derivative uh tends to be a very a positive indicator for future performance. So we like the setup. supply is falling, pricing power should be improving in the aftermath of that uh supply falling and more importantly, the core growth prospects are improving into next year and should accelerate into 27.
02:40
Speaker A
When we talk apartments, Handel, are there important regional differences and distinctions you would highlight?
02:51
Handel
Absolutely. So I think it's, you know, certainly the national apartment market, you know, tends to be viewed as one big behemoth, but, you know, we're looking at regions and looking at cities and, you know, we see a recovery opportunity and that recovery is important because, you know, obviously the future uh growth potential uh it suggests and the sunbelt is the region that's been overburdened with supply the last couple of years, that supply is coming down dramatically into next year. And there's a window here in 26 through 28 where they'll be below average supply. So we like the setup there over the
03:26
Handel
next couple years. Uh but you got to be a bit more aware of the coastal markets. They've been really strong the last couple years. The comps are tough. Uh New York City is a strong apartment market, should be fine the next couple years with low supply. Um but DC, you're concerned about uh Fed job cuts and DODGE. uh, Los Angeles uh showing some weakness uh broadly within that region. Boston is is slowing a bit. So a few more of these coastal markets are slowing, but the best market in the country today is San Francisco. And as a result, we like a company named Essex Property Trust, ESS, which has about 40% of their cash flow exposure from San Francisco.
04:02
Speaker A
Handel, let's say mortgage rates keep dropping and homes get more affordable. Uh 30-year fix, I'm just looking here. uh Mortgage news daily 637. Let's say that kept dropping Handel. what would that mean for the apartment subsector?
04:26
Handel
Absolutely. So I think that's uh that's a great question, certainly one that we're getting from investors these days and, you know, one of the tail winds for the apartment space the last couple years for demand has been the unaffordability of housing on average is about 50% more expensive nationally to own versus rent in some of the coastal markets like San Francisco, New York, it may be even two X. So with rates coming in, uh that has helped the 10 the 30 year mortgage rates gone from near seven to close to six four. Uh rate cuts in the near term probably benefit more of the shorter end of the
05:03
Handel
curve inflation sticky. I'm not sure the long end comes in really over the next uh few weeks, few months here. So something we're watching. Uh but I think that rates today at 6-4 still, still a bit higher than where we think the sweet spot for an increase, a real increase in demand uh for home buying could be and that could be closer to that five to five and a half percent range. So I think another 100 paces basis points of decline from here, which doesn't appear likely, but also think about what would need to happen for rates to decline that much. more uh of a weak economy, consumer
05:43
Handel
confidence would be low. So we're not even sure that if rates were to continue falling on the long end that there would truly be a real uh shift in consumer demand for housing because consumer confidence matters and I'm not sure in that type of backdrop that I just described that there would be a strong amount of consumer confidence and demand for the for sale side of the that the housing market.
06:05
Speaker A
Is there, Handel, and I think you sort of hint at this before. Is there, is there a seasonality uh to that apartment subsector?
06:17
Handel
Absolutely, absolutely. So think about uh when the weather's warmer, your kids are out of school, it's just an easier time for people to look in the spring and into the summer. So the time of year that apartments tend to work best tend to be from, you know, call it March through June, July. And here we are in September heading into October. Landlord tend to play more defense. So it's a better time of year uh to be shopping, you have more negotiability on your uh in in terms of uh some of the rates uh that you can get for apartment because there's less people looking. Uh but the landlord are
06:56
Handel
also savvy in that they also gear less of their expirations during these slower shoulder months. So, you know, I think that there's uh a little bit of operational acumen on their part to make sure that there's not too much availability during these times of year, but yes, this time of year rent tend to fall a little bit, there's less demand and landlords tend to play a bit more defense. So, if you're looking for an apartment, you're better off getting a better deal in in the fall and winter months.
07:37
Speaker A
Handel, finally, you know, we're talking apartments here. What about shopping centers? You know, that's another sector I know you know very well. Any, any picks there, Handel, you you would you would emphasize? You know, consumer does seem to be hanging in there just based on the retail sales data we got this week.
07:56
Handel
Absolutely. So I think there's, you know, it's a sector that, you know, people tend to worry in a worry in a slowing macro. Obviously, there's been lots of chatter about, you know, the consumer and their ability to spend and uh, you know, just uh how stretched that consumer is, but there's been resilience as as you mentioned in some of the retail sales and shopping centers remember, are catering to more of a defensive uh nature. Um think um grocers and more essential items. So there's more of a defensiveness to their their uh retailer base. Uh but also what's important is that there's really no supply. And
08:42
Handel
so I think landlords uh have had pricing power. Uh we see an opportunity for the stocks to continue to work near term because there's a a meaningful amount of embedded growth from leases that have been signed that will start cash flowing over the next year. So you don't need a lot of external growth acquisitions uh to really generate that growth. So defensiveness with uh a steady consistent cash flow growth profile of mid- single digits for next year, which is comparable to this year. And so, uh we like a name, uh Regency, REG, Brixmore, BRX, because they have uh the highest amount of gross
09:20
Handel
uh exposure and as I mentioned before, that brings an element of defensiveness on top of the pricing power that landlords are benefiting from today.
09:27
Speaker A
Handel, I appreciate your time and those picks. Thank you.
09:31
Handel
Great to see you. Thank you.
