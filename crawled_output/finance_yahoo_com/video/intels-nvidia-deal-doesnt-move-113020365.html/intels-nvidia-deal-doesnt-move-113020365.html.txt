Intel's Nvidia deal doesn't 'move the needle,' Intel bear says

INTC
NVDA
Intel (INTC) stock surged last week on news of the company's partnership with Nvidia (NVDA), but Citi head of US semiconductor research Christopher Danely is unconvinced that Intel teaming up with the dominant artificial intelligence (AI) chipmaker will translate to meaningful earnings growth. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Catalysts.

Julie
Well, shares of Intel went on a tear after Nvidia announced a $5 billion investment in the company. That partnership will include a collaboration on PC chips and data centers, though it did not include any details about Intel's foundry business. One analyst less enthusiastic than the price uh reaction would have indicated. Christopher Danely, City Head of US Semiconductor Research, downgraded the stock to sell, raised his price target though to 29 from 24. And he's with me now. Chris, it's good to see you. Um,
00:33
Chris
Thanks, Julie.
00:34
Julie
So, obviously, there was a lot of enthusiasm after this happened. Um, but really the question was, is it a buy? Does this make it a buy after this happened? You come in and you emphatically say, no, it does not. What is the main reason why it's not?
00:54
Chris
Sure. So, I really don't think that any of these three uh sort of actions that came out are going to amount to much. The easiest one to quantify is the $5 billion investment. Okay, that's fine. You get some cash. Um, the second part uh is Intel is going to integrate Nvidia graphics into its processors for uh laptops. Okay. Um we all know that Intel is uh sort of behind AMD uh in terms of microprocessors. And if you look at the sort of ability or judge the ability of a processor or microprocessor, the graphics chip or graphics capability really doesn't have much to do with that. So, A, they have to be able to integrate it. It's not their technology. That's going to take at least a year, year and a half. and B, even if they do, we really don't think that changes the competitive dynamics. And then the third part where we actually think it's going to uh work somewhat, but not um move the needle much is Nvidia is going to integrate Intel processors into its AI product offerings. Okay, sounds good. So what's going on there? So this is primarily aimed at the Grace product uh that Nvidia offers. Uh this is sort of a um like a low-end uh AI um product, right? Not very successful. At best, this thing is generating 3 to 5 billion in sales per year, which sounds good, but that's the processor plus all the, you know, the goodies that go around it. So if you look at the processor itself, that's max 1 to 2 billion. Right now, that's only being offered with Arm processors. Now they're going to offer some Intel processors. We think that, okay, fine. This is probably going to work. Intel's probably going to get some business like this. Maybe it's a billion, maybe two, three billion max, several years out. And Intel's a 50 billion plus uh company. So it doesn't really move the needle in our opinion. And the main problem here, uh like you hinted about is, you know, Intel continues to lose billions uh in this foundry offering, and we think that if anything, this sort of keeps Intel uh in this foundry product that continues to lose billions. And you know, we don't like any of our stocks to lose billions of dollars on anything. So, that was the gist of why we pulled the plug is that it's going to probably keep them in the foundry efforts. People, um investors are getting excited that yeah, you know, they got Nvidia now, they're going to sign them to a foundry deal. We think nothing could be further from the truth. Intel's essentially light years behind the competition. Uh the stock's up 50, 50% uh in the last six or seven weeks. Part of that is on speculation this deal, part of that is on the deal. Uh you know, we just don't think that at $30, the stock is going to generate, I don't know, maybe a buck, maybe a buck 50 in earnings max. You're talking, you know, 20 to 30 times. Nah, it's time to, as Marv said in Wall Street, take the money and run on this.
