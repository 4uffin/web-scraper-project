Mortgage rates fell, then went back up. Will Fed rate cuts help?
Yahoo Finance Video
Fri, Sep 19, 2025, 2:15 PM

The Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 25 basis points at its September meeting on Wednesday — the first rate cut in 2025. The US central bank currently forecasts two more rate cuts in 2025. Additionally, although mortgage rates recently hit their lowest level in a year, they have since ticked back up.
Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Claire Boston joins Mind Your Money with Allie Canal to discuss how rate cuts could impact mortgage rates.

Video Transcript

Allie
As expected, the Federal Reserve cut rates by a quarter point at its September meeting, bringing the benchmark policy rate down to 4.25%.
00:09
Allie
Now, mortgage rates aren't directly tied to the Fed's move, but the benchmark rate can influence them. To break down what this means for home buyers, I'm joined by Yahoo Finance housing reporter Claire Boston.
00:20
Allie
So, Claire, mortgage rates are now at their lowest level since October of last year. Should we expect them to shift at all following this latest decision?
00:29
Claire Boston
Yeah, Allie, so we're actually starting to see them shift already, and unfortunately, things are not going the way that we had hoped.
00:36
Allie
No!
00:37
Claire Boston
Uh mortgage rates started to rise a little bit yesterday and then today they are up about 15 basis points more.
00:43
Claire Boston
Um, you know, not what we want to see, but, you know, we talk a lot on this show about how mortgage rates are really tied to that 10-year Treasury and treasury yields have been rising, you know, based on new economic data and also people looking at what uh Fed Chair Powell was saying yesterday and thinking, okay, you know, I'm not seeing that they're going to cut rates a zillion more times this year. It may only be a few times.
01:03
Claire Boston
Powell was talking about economic uncertainty and so it's a little unclear kind of what the path is from here.
01:08
Allie
Yeah, he was really emphasizing a lot of those risks. But the Fed did signal two more rate cuts from here, another one pencilled in for 2026. How much of that though has already been baked in to mortgage rates?
01:19
Claire Boston
Yeah, I think some of it was definitely already in there. Uh it was the base case that we were going to get these additional two potential rate cuts this year. Um, you know, I think from here, we really have to look at what economic data do we get, Is it showing that the job market is weakening or strengthening? And um, you know, in those cases, those little economic data releases can really cause treasury yields and mortgage rates to move a lot given these uncertain times.
01:39
Allie
Now with rates back closer to 6%, National Association of Realtors' Chief economist Lawrence Yun, he told Yahoo Finance, that's a good thing for buyers. So I want to take a listen to what he had to say.
01:51
Lawrence Yun
This is a great news for potential home buyers uh who have been priced out, but now with lower rates, their purchasing power increases and we expect more buyers to begin to knock on the door.
02:03
Allie
So Claire, how much are these lower rates driving some uptick in activity in the housing market right now?
02:10
Claire Boston
Yeah, I think on the purchase side, it's a little bit too early to tell. Um, you know, given that rates are still in this 6% area, it's still pretty hard to afford a home. But what we are seeing is a little bit of a refinancing surge. Last week refinancings were up 58%. So you know, I think that's a really clear sign that people are paying attention. They're seeing that rates have fallen quite a bit in recent weeks. And, you know, for those people that are at the 7% mortgage area or higher, you know, they're definitely what we would call in the money for a refi, meaning that, you know, the savings would pay for itself pretty quickly.
02:41
Allie
And for those would be home buyers still sitting on the sidelines here. Is it too late to take advantage of these lower rates?
02:47
Claire Boston
Yeah, so I mean, I think it depends, you know, what will happen in the coming weeks. Um, you know, that being said, when I talk to people like mortgage brokers, they say over and over again, it's really hard to time the market, don't try to do it. You know, when you are ready to buy a home, uh, you know, buy then regardless of where the rates are. Uh refinancing is an option, should rates fall, um, but otherwise, uh, you know, you might be waiting if you're trying to, you know, hit some magic number there.
03:11
Allie
Yes. And that's advice that I feel like I've been giving to my friends, a lot of those home buyers that uh or would be home buyers that want to enter this complicated market. But Claire, thank you so much. Appreciate it.
03:23
Claire Boston
Thank you.
