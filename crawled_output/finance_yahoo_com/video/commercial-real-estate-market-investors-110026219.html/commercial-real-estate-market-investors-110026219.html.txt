Video Transcript
00:00
Speaker A
the conditions could not have been more challenging for commercial real estate over the last few years, but as the tide on some of these forces starts to turn, so too have opportunities in the market started to appear. Joining us now to discuss all things CRE is Hessam Nadji, the CEO at Marcus and Millichap. Hessam, thanks so much for stopping by. Welcome to New York. Thanks for uh stopping by the studio here. Let's just start with like the the overall setup right now.
00:36
Speaker A
Basic conversation you're having with a client. Someone says, hey, what's the state of play with commercial real estate? Because I think a lot of people are still benchmarked to this idea um that it's just, you know, 70% LTVs on all these building. Everything's a disaster. What does it look like to you guys today?
00:54
Hessam Nadji
Well, first of all, thanks for having me. It's great to be here with you.
00:58
Hessam Nadji
It is a picture that's changing very rapidly in that uh the market was basically in a shock state in 2023. 2024 was a little bit of a recovery from that. But uh it's been very difficult to value real estate when interest rates have been such a moving target. 500 basis points uh of a of an increase can be a sledgehammer to valuations. And so investors pulled to the sideline, now they're coming back in. Why are they coming back in?
01:34
Hessam Nadji
First and foremost, the easing cycle has begun. Um, and it's begun not because the economy's fallen over a cliff. We're hearing a lot about the job market slowing down, the job revisions which were pretty severe. Most of it or I should say a lot of it was in government job revisions, which bodes well for the private sector. And then on top of that, prices have adjusted in the last two and a half years to the point where if you look at opportunities across multifamily, shopping centers,
02:08
Hessam Nadji
office buildings that have been badly affected by valuation corrections, it now looks like there is a path to recovery and a path to uh, you know, a five-year outlook that includes very good occupancies, good income levels for the asset class, but also another cycle of price appreciation.
02:30
Hessam Nadji
This includes, you know, like warehousing, distribution uh facilities or even self-storage or senior's housing facilities. We're seeing it across the full spectrum of commercial real estate.
02:40
Speaker A
Yeah, let's um let's double click on offices because I think it's it's the kind of thing people can't get enough of the talk of like, oh I had to go back, I can't go back, all this kind of stuff. Um what dynamics are you seeing when it comes to either companies wanting to take on new leases, extend leases, maybe a company was stuck in a lease and now they're like, actually it's fine. I'm comfortable with this now. What's that dynamic for uh offices specifically?
03:09
Hessam Nadji
Probably the most important thing that you don't read as much about, besides the return to work mandates by companies, bringing more traffic uh into the buildings, you know, daily than than we've seen since the, you know, 1920, 19 2019 period, you know, pre-pandemic is the fact that as leases roll over and companies are now looking into the next five to seven years,
03:36
Hessam Nadji
they are being a lot more conservative about office space. So the push for efficiency, not just because of the resistance of a lot of workers not wanting to come in every day, but also for uh profitability and productivity.
03:54
Hessam Nadji
There is a push to reduce footprint. That coupled with the fact that uh, you know, a good percentage of the workforce will still be hybrid into the next cycle, it's going to reduce demand.
04:08
Hessam Nadji
However, we're coming off of the extreme lows of the last few years. Daily traffic is now up to 80% of what it was pre-pandemic and uh and improving all the time. Uh I just think the good news for the office market is that there's hardly any new construction. If you look at it as a sector. There are some pockets here and there. And the differences between old obsolete assets versus newer class A, you know, modern office buildings is uh is very significant.
