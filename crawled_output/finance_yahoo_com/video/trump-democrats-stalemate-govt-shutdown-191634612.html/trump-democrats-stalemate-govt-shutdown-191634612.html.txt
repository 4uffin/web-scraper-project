Trump, Democrats in stalemate as govt. shutdown deadline nears
Yahoo Finance Video
Wed, September 24, 2025 at 3:16 PM EDT
US lawmakers edge closer and closer to a possible government shutdown as the September 30 deadline nears. Republicans and Democrats are currently divided on a compromise. Yahoo Finance Washington correspondent Ben Werschkul reports on the political pressures at play on Capitol Hill and what a shutdown would mean for federal workers and Trump administration officials. Also catch HerMoney Podcast host Jean Chatzky explain what a possible government shutdown could mean for American retirees. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination.
Video Transcript
00:00
Speaker A
You know, listen, I I think Ben at this point, some investors Ben, they may hear the phrase government shutdown and you can just sort of feel people's eyes kind of glazing over, but explain to me Ben, why why they shouldn't be glazing over. Why we should be paying attention here Ben and and and whether this is really going to happen.
00:23
Ben
For sure. I even live here in Washington and my eyes can kind of glaze over with this shutdown talk. But there is a growing sense here in Washington that this time could be different. Um and that's because the political dynamics are shifting here. This is especially true after Donald Trump canceled a meeting with with with Democrats that was scheduled to take place today, but is now off the books entirely as both of them go forward. It gets to kind of a larger dynamic that is solidifying here in Washington, I think by the day that both parties
01:05
Ben
at least have factions within their party that are not only okay with a shutdown, but view it as an opportunity, either a political opportunity or a policy opportunity. So there's lots of energy and the political pressure seems to be pushing in the direction of a shutdown on both sides. It's not to say that, you know, the the time to watch will be early next week when all the lawmakers return and a a wave of final negotiations happen. But the man in the middle here as usual is Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader. He reminded folks, he was the guy that kind of blinked
01:36
Ben
in March at the last shutdown standoff and and made concessions that averted that. His message this time around is that the I'll give you the quote, the world is totally changed from March. The question is whether whether folks believe him yet, and whether Democrats will be willing to kind of see through a shutdown, which they have historically have not. We're going to get a big sense of that early next week as I mentioned, when these two kind of negotiations begin in earnest. But right now, folks are talking past each other. Um and we're going to have this kind of 48-hour period Monday, Tuesday when we have this wave of negotiations and either they see it or we start to see a shutdown that could have economic effects starting scattered at the beginning and that grow over time.
02:08
Speaker A
So how might a shutdown, Ben, let's just walk through this. How would it, you know, how would it actually play out? Like if it comes to that, what would be at stake here for for markets, for federal workers, for the economy, if the government really were to, you know, close its doors?
02:27
Ben
Yeah, so there's a few stages of this. The first one is is images we've seen before. Airlines are usually in focus early in a shutdown because air traffic controllers and TSA agents are government employees. The way this generally works is that both of those groups are asked to continue working without pay, which can, which can cause disruptions and things like that. So airlines are usually in focus and there's a lot of images that we'll see. We're expected to see a closed Lincoln Memorial, closed national parks, things like that. What I'm watching are a couple more after that.
03:00
Ben
The first one is how the Trump administration actually gets into mechanically approaching a shutdown. That's because Trump's team has has toyed with the idea of kind of using a shutdown as an opportunity for policy changes. Cabinet members get a lot more power during a shutdown to essentially decide who is essential, who's not essential. There's a lot of leeway they have there that people don't realize. And so they could use that to enact their policy goals. People have liked it to
03:29
Ben
Doge under kind of a different name, sort of using using a shutdown powers to do that. So that's that's one that would be it's to be determined how far the Trump team would go on that, but if they did, it would be very controversial and would could have economic effects and put political pressure. In terms of larger economic effects, the deadline here is a little further out. The rule of thumb with shutdowns is that the only time it's a real drag on the economy is when it's measured in weeks as opposed to days. Basically in a couple day shutdown, government funding stops, but then it catches up when the government opens.
04:00
Ben
If we're going into weeks and times, we're going to see a lot of alarm bells, but that again, that deadline is a little ways off. So that would be kind of a a mid October thing if we're still in a shutdown period after a couple of weeks. Then we might see a real drag on the economy, but it's a lot of these kind of smaller issues to start things off.
04:19
Speaker A
All right, we'll keep watching. Ben, thank you. Appreciate it.
04:22
Ben
All right, thanks.
