Fed looks 'more cohesive' as it balances dual mandate: Gary Cohn
Yahoo Finance Video

IBM
Federal Reserve officials cut interest rates by 25 basis points at their September meeting on Wednesday, the first rate cut in 2025. The US central bank currently forecasts two more rate cuts in 2025, while Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted ongoing risks in the waning labor supply and demand. International Business Machines (IBM) Vice Chair Gary Cohn shares his thoughts on the Fed's current situation as officials try to balance their dual mandate regarding inflation and the labor market. Catch Yahoo Finance's full interview with Gary Cohn by clicking here. Cohn also served as the director of the National Economic Council (NEC) under the first Trump administration, from 2017 to 2018. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Opening Bid.
Video Transcript
00:00
Speaker A
Every time uh the Fed chair mentioned the labor market, I'm like, wow, I mean, the jobs market's going to stink and it's going to get worse. But does that reinforce the point we've heard from President Trump that this is too late J?
00:12
Jay
You know, I don't know if it's too late, Jay. The job market has clearly been softening over the last few months. On the other hand, the inflation numbers have not come down as fast as is is is the chair we want. Now they've they've come down, but they're still stuck, you know, core still stuck around 3%, 2.9%, and his target is to get it to 2%. So, look, you can criticize any part of this whole equation you want. You can criticize that the chair is late because the job market has gotten soft. You could criticize because he's being too aggressive because inflation's too high. Like I said, it's a two-factor model he's trying to balance out.
00:46
Speaker A
Um, what do you I mean, you will not hear Powell say this, but did he bent to pressure from the administration?
00:54
Jay
You know, I don't think so. I at the end of the day, I don't think he bend. In in fact, if you look at the committee, there was one dissenting vote. The entire committee
01:03
Speaker A
Stephen Myron. Yeah. Yeah, new guy.
01:05
Jay
Yeah, the new guy. Um the entire committee voted for this cut. Um and there was one disenter. It's it's funny, in the meeting prior to this, there were more disseners than there were in this meeting. So it actually looks like the chair has brought the committee together is more cohesive. They've got a a a methodical plan that they're on right now of this this slow but steady potential cutting cycle.
01:25
Speaker A
How worried are you that we do see a deeper economic downturn at the same time the Fed is cutting rates?
01:31
Jay
I got I there's always the potential of a deep economic downturn. You know, that's part of the economy. You know, we we have events that we don't see coming and we always get caught off guard because we don't see them coming. So, you know, we we have these quote-unquote black swan events. if if if they were white swans, we'd know they were coming. So look, you we're always worried about events like that and usually there's some cause that that happens, some exogenous event that happens. You know, as as I sit here today, I don't see anything. But I would have given that same answer a month before a couple major financial crisis that the world looks good today, I don't see anything. and after these events happen, they look pretty obvious. To me right now, you know, we're we're in an environment where the market, the equity market's at record high, credit spreads are all-time tight. Look, the dollar's weakening, dollar's weakening pretty considerably, but nothing looks too out of line right now.
