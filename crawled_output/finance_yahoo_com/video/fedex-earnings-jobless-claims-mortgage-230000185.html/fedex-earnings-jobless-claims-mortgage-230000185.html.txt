Speaker A
Time now for what to watch Thursday, September 18th. We're going to start off on the earnings front. We're going to be getting a new batch reports on Thursday from Darden Restaurants, FedEx and Lennar.
00:14
Speaker A
FedEx announced results for the first quarter after the market's close. Analysts expecting FedEx to face pressure from new tariffs and the end of duty-free small packages known as the de minimis exemption.
00:24
Speaker A
China making up about 60% of the 1.36 billion de minimis packages that FedEx shipped into the US last year.
00:33
Speaker A
And taking a look at the labor market, we're going to be getting another key piece of jobs data on Thursday with initial jobless claims.
00:39
Speaker A
Economist forecast that number to fall compared to the week prior to 240,000 signaling that layoff slowed and fewer people filed for unemployment benefits.
00:51
Speaker A
And moving over to housing, weekly mortgage rate data from Freddie Mac coming out on Thursday. 30-year fixed mortgage rate falling to 6.35% in the last reading, the lowest rate since October 2024.
01:03
Speaker A
And another drop on Thursday would make it five straight weeks of declines.
