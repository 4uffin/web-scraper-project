Josh
San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly making keynote remarks on the outlook for the US economy at the University of Utah. This comes amid a slew of Fed speak this week. and now Finance's Jennifer Schonberger joins us now with the very latest. Jen.
00:13
Jennifer Schonberger
Hey Josh, that's right. San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly speaking right now, saying she fully supported the Fed's decision to cut rates by a quarter percentage point last week, and said it's likely further interest rate cuts will be needed.
00:30
Jennifer Schonberger
Speaking in that speech just now in Salt Lake City, Utah, Daly saying, quote, moving forward, it is likely that further policy adjustments will be needed as we work to restore price stability while providing needed support to the labor market. This comes through in our most recent projections released last week, but these are projections, she cautioned, not promises.
00:53
Jennifer Schonberger
Notice, Daly not pinpointing just how many rate cuts she expects to see for the remainder of this year, but there was a plural, there was an S on policy adjustments. And Daly has expressed concern about the strength of the job market, saying today in today's speech that there have been noticeable shifts in the balance of risks.
01:17
Jennifer Schonberger
Along those lines, we heard Tuesday from Fed Governor Michelle Bowman, who has expressed concern about the job market as well, but perhaps a bit more alarmist than Daly, Bowman warning that the job market could deteriorate, quote, significantly in the coming months, and that there is, quote, a serious risk that the Fed is behind the curve here.
01:38
Jennifer Schonberger
She noted that if the job market continues to deteriorate or we see data along the lines of what we've seen over the past couple of months, that she would advocate for rate cuts in more frequently and in larger increments. Contrast that with what Fed chair Jay Powell also said on Tuesday, in which he's not as alarmed about the labor market.
02:00
Jennifer Schonberger
He's looking at both sides of the Fed's dual mandate, non-committal when it comes to the policy outlook, saying that policy is not on a preset course, and acknowledging the challenges of both sides of the Fed's mandate, sticky inflation and weakening job growth, saying that there is no risk-free policy path here.
