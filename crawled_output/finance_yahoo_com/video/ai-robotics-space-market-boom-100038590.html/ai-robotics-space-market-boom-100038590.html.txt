Check out the full episode here.Twice a week, Stocks In Translation cuts through the market mayhem, noisy numbers and hyperbole to give you the information you need to make the right trade for your portfolio.

Video Transcript
00:00
Speaker A
First of all, the risks are not being involved. I mean, most people think everyone's in the market and to some extent you are if you have a pension plan or a retirement plan, but the risk right now is to become a little bit too bullish complacency, you know, that bullish complacency, but
00:15
Speaker A
that used to be bearish when everybody seems to be bullish, which I think we're at. But if you look at statistics, there are still enough bears to keep the wall of worry going.
00:29
Speaker B
We're not in euphoria territory.
00:30
Speaker A
Right. We're not. It some people think we are, but really truly not. And a lot of the stocks that we're we're talking about that that those space rockets, robots, a lot of them did consolidate and just began a new bull market. So, and as far as I'm concerned, you know, it's so hard to be bearish because I really do think we just entered a new industrial revolution and so far so good. And
00:54
Speaker B
Yeah. Well, let's talk about that new industrial revolution and how you're trading it. We keep saying space rockets, robots, quantum AI chips and this new thing that some of them have broken out, but specifically what do you like? Like what what tickers?
01:10
Speaker A
Yeah, well, obviously the RGTI has been paying us really well. And now there's a leverage version of that, which is thank you, stock market gods because
01:21
Speaker B
There's a lot of leverage now.
01:22
Speaker A
Holy cow. Anything that's invented right now seems to be created for me. Thank you. Uh, RGTX is the wildest thing I have seen in a very long time. So, if you understand technical analysis, you understand breakouts, instead of buying the RGTI, you buy the RGTX. So if RGTI is going up 20 cents, the RGTX seem to go up three points. It doesn't seem like just two times leverage. It seems like it's a 10 times leverage. And they keep creating stocks like that, even Oracle. I mean, the list goes on and on about these double and triple leverage stocks.
01:54
Speaker A
And that's where you want to be going. But right now, the the the the same stocks we mentioned a year ago are still really, really doing well. RR, that's the robotic stocks. You got, you know, some of the lesser known names. Um you got Serve, you got ASTS, you've got, you know, the rocket labs.
02:11
Speaker A
And again, to your question about the risks, because they've gone up so much so quickly that, you know, the risks are for a 20% haircut any day now. But then what? That's the question. So if you if even if you top tick these stocks going in and you're getting in late, when they do correct, it's not like I don't I don't think they're going to crash and burn. Some will, and that's why, you know, proper stops is how do you stay in this business. But right now, after the correction, it's it's probably going to be bought again. So it's just a great time to be looking at some of these stocks. And if you get an opportunity to buy them, buy the pullback.
