Speaker A
And if you look at the backdrop, which is what you do, you try to look at the real economic indicators behind the official economic data coming out of China, looking through that prism, how motivated is China at this point?
00:13
Speaker B
Well, look, there is no pressure on them um still uh to come to the table with any kind of big uh deal or any kind of big gives. Um as a matter of fact, if you look at China Beige Book's August data, what we saw was that the economy uh is actually starting to turn a little bit of a corner, it seems like. Uh things are finally getting better compared to year-ago levels. The consumer spending results actually looked fine. Manufacturing looks like uh it's orders pictures pretty strong. So, whereas I think China, you know, may have exaggerated how strong they were earlier in the year and is seemingly putting out somewhat softer data now, we're seeing the reverse. They got hit initially when the tariffs went into place and are actually seem to be climbing out of that uh as as the summer comes to an end.
00:58
Speaker A
Why is that happening? Because you would think, you know, with the tariffs that, you know, some manufacturers are pulling back on orders still, or moving uh capacity when they can to other countries.
01:10
Speaker B
Yeah, you know, we don't I think have the kind of big exodus of Chinese manufacturing out of of or manufacturing out of China, I should say. Instead, what you're getting is China's trade with Southeast Asian countries has been exploding, its trade now we know with Africa is exploding. And so what is probably going on is that we're a directive trying to trade might be uh slowing down. You're getting most likely a pretty serious rerouting of goods happening, you know, trans shipment, which is the other big concern of course that uh the US trade representative's office and the administration have had.
01:40
Speaker A
Yeah, and they've have said that they're going to try to prevent that in various ways, that rerouting if you will. But it sounds like that effort is not really changing much at this point.
01:52
Speaker B
Oh, I don't think much has been done at all. I know that there's some task force that has been announced in the Department of Justice. We'll see what they accomplish. But the reality is this is an incredibly cumbersome project and and that kind of uh I think capacity, quite frankly, doesn't even exist here in the United States, let alone existing in places like Vietnam and Cambodia.
02:11
Speaker A
Right. Um so when you talk about that the economic data is now actually looking a little bit better, would you call it an inflection point? Would you go so far as to say that that we are really going to see more of an expansion there, trade deal or no trade deal, by the way?
02:22
Speaker B
I think so, uh because a lot of the pressures uh seem to be at least for now uh receding. And so it is quite likely that the third quarter, rather than being this boring story that we were getting out of China, at least in our results, which was that the economy continues to swim in place, it may actually look like it's turning a bit of a corner as I said. Uh that's still TBD. We're still running our results uh we're still gathering our results, I should say.
02:44
Speaker A
Well, looking forward to that.
