Dot plot: The Fed's key chart explained (for beginners)
Yahoo Finance Video
September 17, 2025
Wall Street closely watches Federal Reserve meetings, but it's not just the decision on interest rates that makes headlines. The central bank's dot plot is a key quarterly forecast for both investors and economists. But what exactly is it? Yahoo Finance senior reporter Alexandra Canal explains. You can see more on the Fed's next interest rate decision here, and what the September dot plot showed here.
Video Transcript
00:00
Speaker A
Wall Street is buzzing about the Fed's highly anticipated dot plot, but what exactly is it and why does it matter so much to investors and policy makers?
00:06
Speaker A
Simply put, the dot plot is a chart showing where each of the 19 Fed officials think interest rates are headed.
00:12
Speaker A
You'll see clusters of dots for 2025, 2026, 2027 and longer run projections.
00:18
Speaker A
Each dot is anonymous. It could belong to Fed Chair Jerome Powell or Chicago Fed President Austin Goolsby, but we don't know who's who.
00:25
Speaker A
Now, if we zoom in for the dots for 2025 alone, the June projections show that the majority of Fed officials anticipated two rate cuts to end the year.
00:33
Speaker A
But what was interesting compared to the month of March is that seven officials thought that rates would remain where they were.
00:40
Speaker A
So that symbolizes a more hawkish stance for the part of the Fed. This is likely going to be revised.
00:45
Speaker A
Now, the dot plot is released four times a year as part of the Fed's summary of economic projections.
00:51
Speaker A
Alongside the rate forecasts, officials also update their outlooks for growth, inflation and unemployment.
00:57
Speaker A
Those economic projections help contextualize the dots.
01:01
Speaker A
For example, in June officials raised their inflation and jobless rate estimates while trimming their growth outlook.
01:07
Speaker A
That sent a message that policy makers expect a cooler economy even as price pressures linger.
01:13
Speaker A
For investors, the dot pot reflects where officials think rates should go at a given moment, not necessarily where they will go.
01:19
Speaker A
Even Powell himself has warned against reading too much into it. So why release it at all?
01:24
Speaker A
Well, the dot plot was introduced after the 2008 financial crisis. With rates near zero and the Fed buying trillions in bonds, markets wanted clarity on when policy might shift.
01:32
Speaker A
Then Chair Ben Bernaki and his successor Janet Yellen used it as a tool for forward guidance.
01:39
Speaker A
Critics argue it creates false precision and Powell has tried to downplay its weight.
01:44
Speaker A
Still, each quarter it remains one of the most closely watched pieces of Fed communication.
