Fed likely to cut 25 basis points, but later cuts are unclear
Yahoo Finance Video
and Josh Lipton
Wed, Sep 17, 2025, 6:30 AM
The Federal Reserve will decide on interest rate cuts on Wednesday, Sept. 17. Aristotle Pacific managing director and portfolio manager Jeff Klingelhofer and StoneX senior adviser Jon Hilsenrath join Market Domination to discuss what's ahead, noting that that while they think the market is correct in pricing in a 25 basis point cut, investors may be getting ahead of themselves in expecting a "durable rate cutting cycle." To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination.
Video Transcript
00:00
Speaker A
Wall Street awaiting possibly the most important Fed decision of the year on Wednesday with retail sales coming in strong on Tuesday though investors may be wondering if the market even needs a cut to keep moving higher. For more, we're bringing in our John Hilsenrath, senior advisor at Stone X and Jeff Klingelhoffer, managing director and portfolio manager at Aristotle Pacific. Guys, welcome to you both. Uh, Jeff, I'll start with you. You know, the Fed decision on, on deck, Jeff, we are we are very certain we're going to get a cut tomorrow, Jeff. Let let's
00:33
Speaker A
start with that question though. Do is in your opinion, you look at the data, Jeff, are you convinced we need a cut here?
00:39
Jeff Klingelhoffer
You know, the way I would talk about it is the Fed's classic dual mandate is in tension today and there's no question that the jobs market is softening. But on the flip side, what we saw out of last week's CPI print is that inflation is also broadening and so today we're perhaps even more in tension. When I look out at the world, when I look at financial markets, to me, I think 25 basis points in a day is about right, but I think the markets are far too ahead of themselves with a very strong assumption that this isn't just the first of one fed cut or the first of two, it's the start of a durable rate cutting cycle. And that's really where I become apprehensive because the data is just not there to support that today and I think the Fed will talk about being data dependent in the future.
01:20
Speaker A
Let me ask you, when you saw that August retail sales this morning though, beat expectations, the control group which feeds into GDP, that was above consensus. Um, do you think that gives the Hawks Jeff, maybe a little bit more ammo?
01:33
Jeff Klingelhoffer
You know, I think it exactly does. And and I I think going back to one of the earlier, uh comments from President Trump is listening to smart people. We should also be listening to the actual underlying data. And the data today tells us that the consumer, albeit in a weakening spot is still very, very strong. The way I like to think about it today is it's less about actual incomes and therefore jobs. And today, what I'm watching more closely and Aristotle Pacific is watching is a lot more focused on financial conditions because that re-leveraging cycle is playing out and it's supportive and that's coming through in the data today.
02:07
Speaker A
John, I want to bring you in here as well. What do you what are you looking for tomorrow, John? What do you, what do you expect to see and hear and what, what do you think the pace of cuts looks like?
02:16
John Hilsenrath
Well, I mean, I agree with a lot of what Jeff just said about where the economy is and and what's justified. Let's not forget the inflation rate is around 3%, which is above the Fed's 2% objective. I think tomorrow when the Fed revises its forecast for the economy, we're going to see them revising up their inflation forecast for 2026. So, it's not screaming rate cuts. But of course, there's the political backdrop to all of this, which makes it a bit of a challenge for J Powell to navigate and kind of storytell. I think what happens tomorrow is they cut rates by a quarter percentage point.
02:54
John Hilsenrath
They write down in their so-called dot plot, which is their projection of where the Fed funds rate will be at the end of the year, a total of two rate cuts, so one more after tomorrow's. But then in the press conference, Powell leaves the door open to possibly three. I think what he wants to come out with tomorrow is options. He wants optionality. If the job market continues to show signs of weakness, if we get another really bad payroll report, he wants to be able to move again in October if he has to. So, I agree the market has gotten a little ahead of itself, but he doesn't want to completely pull it back. Uh, he just wants to get some cards in his hands.
