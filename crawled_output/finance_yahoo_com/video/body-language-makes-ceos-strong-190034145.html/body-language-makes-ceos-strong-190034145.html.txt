Video Transcript
00:00
Speaker A
You've taught everyone from the CIA, FBI, Wells Fargo executives, um, Coca-Cola execs. What is the body language that you've seen that successful CEOs have in common?
00:08
Miss Linda
Number one, great posture.
00:10
Miss Linda
Great posture when they're presenting. Number two, when they are around people, they are open and available. And those are the great CEOs for great posture because when you look at someone's posture, you're going to be able to question, are they okay? Are they sick, not feeling well? Are there uh disabilities, invisible disabilities. We create narratives, but those that are confident, they walk with power and presence and stand with power and presence when they're in a room.
00:34
Speaker A
So, Ms. Linda, what is the most common mistake you see in body language with entrepreneurs?
00:40
Miss Linda
One of the biggest mistakes that they make is not realizing that the person that they're engaging with the very first time doesn't know their baseline. So, for example, I have a friend, all the time when you talk to them about a problem, they fold their arms. That's their norm. They're folding their arms because they're thinking about it, they're trying to work it out. But if you meet them for the very first time, you're thinking, oh my gosh, the person is closed off. So folded arms when it's your norm and the other person doesn't know it, is the biggest issue that I see with lots of times with entrepreneurs. It's habits that they have that new people or other people don't know about.
