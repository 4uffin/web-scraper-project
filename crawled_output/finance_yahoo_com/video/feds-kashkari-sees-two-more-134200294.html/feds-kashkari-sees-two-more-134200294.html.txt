Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis CEO and president Neel Kashkari wrote in a new essay that he has raised his expectations for interest rate cuts in 2025 to three. This all comes after the Fed cut rates by 25 basis points earlier this week while forecasting two more cuts to come by the end of the year. Yahoo Finance senior Fed reporter Jennifer Schonberger underlines Kashkari's concerns around a cooling labor market. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief.

We of course have to talk about with the inflation data, the um uh what the Fed is going to be doing. There's a new piece out from Neil Kashkari here this morning that's getting a lot of attention, Jen.

Jen
Good morning, Julia. That's right. Minneapolis Fed President Neil Kashgari out with a new essay this morning in which he says he's more concerned about the jobs market that of the Fed's dual mandate rather than sticky inflation. and as a result, he actually upped the number of rate cuts he sees this year for a total of three. That's up from two, which is what he pencilled in back in June. Kashkari writing in that essay, quote, I believe the risk of a sharp increase in unemployment warrants the committee taking some action to support the labor market. Though he added the caveat that the Fed is not on a preset course for a series of rate cuts. And if the labor market were to become resilient, restrengthen, then perhaps the Fed could hit the pause button on any further rate cuts, or if warranted, even hike rates. Now, when it comes to the inflation side of the Fed's dual mandate, he said that there's going to be uncertainty he expects around the impact of tariffs on inflation for the next year or two, but that he doesn't expect inflation to pop much above 3%. He doesn't see it coming to 4 or 5%. And for that reason, he feels okay to be focused more on the job side of the dual mandate. Uh though he did also say that he's monitoring inflation expectations and noted that any threat to Central Bank independence could cause that to wobble.
