Fed officials signal increasing caution about 2025 rate cuts
Yahoo Finance Video
Thu, September 25, 2025 at 3:33 PM EDT
More Federal Reserve officials are beginning to change their tune around additional interest rate cuts in 2025 after the US central bank reduced rates by 25 basis points last week. Yahoo Finance senior Fed reporter Jennifer Schonberger highlights Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid and Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee's latest hesitations on further rate cuts over labor market risks and uneasy inflation Inversely, Fed Governor Michelle Bowman expressed concern earlier this week about the labor market end of the central bank's dual mandate.

Video Transcript
00:00
Josh
Fed officials, they continue to share their remarks this week sending mixed signals on interest rates. Jen, what what is the latest from the Fed?
00:08
Jen
Hey there Josh. Yeah, that great debate within the Federal Reserve over just how much to cut interest rates further continues to rage on. Uh, we heard today from Kansas City Fed President Jeff Schmid along with Chicago Fed President Austin Goolsby, who both struck a note of caution over the notion of a series of rate cuts over concerns of sticky inflation.
00:36
Jen
Kansas City Fed's president Jeff Schmid, a voting member of the FOMC this year, who has been in favor of holding rates steady for much of the year, said he favored cutting rates last week because he viewed it as appropriate risk management, though he seemed to indicate that further rate cuts was not something he particularly might favor.
00:59
Jen
While he was more concerned about sticky inflation heading towards 3% rather than back down towards the Fed's 2% target, it was the weaker recent jobs data that convinced him that perhaps the job market is weakening more substantially or abruptly than thought.
1:19
Jen
Schmid saying in a speech earlier today in Dallas, Texas that quote, my view is that inflation remains too high, while the labor market, though cooling, still remains largely in balance. I view the current stance of policy is only slightly restrictive, which I think is the right place to be.
1:35
Jen
Now Schmid said he's going to take a data dependent approach to setting monetary policy in the future. Meanwhile, Chicago Fed president Austin Goolsby said that he's somewhat uneasy with front loading a series of too many rate cuts based solely on weaker payrolls.
1:53
Jen
Uh Goolsby saying quote, if we are in this environment where inflation's been above the 2% target for almost five years in a row now and it's going the wrong way, just counting on the inflation to be transitory makes me uneasy.
2:10
Jen
Now, elsewhere, we also heard from Fed Governor Michael Barr for the first time since the Fed cut rates last week, and he too expressed that he favored a rate cut last week as a move of risk management, though he cautioned about the inflation side of the Fed's dual mandate, saying that that would actually call for the Fed to hold rates steady or even hike rates, while the employment side of the Fed's dual mandate would cause, would call for lowering rates.
2:42
Jen
And so he said, as the Fed looks for future adjustments, it's important to keep a watchful eye on inflation. He still thinks going forward, the move is lower over time.
2:54
Jen
On the flip side, we also heard again from Fed Governor Michelle Bowman, who again expressed concern about the job market and seems to think that the Fed should focus on that over the inflation side of their dual mandate. We got some color on just how many rate cuts that would spell this year. Take a listen.
3:14
Michelle Bowman
So, in my mind, I think that means that we may come to see, uh, three rate cuts by the end of this year as I had initially projected in December of 2024.
3:28
Michelle Bowman
When we see that one of our mandates is uh is the conditions are uh more fragile than potentially the other uh side of our dual mandate, then we should be refocusing our monetary policy decision-making to focus on to one bringing our our um policy rate closer to neutral so that we're not uh unnecessarily restricting economic conditions based on where the policy rate is.
3:52
Michelle Bowman
So in my mind, I think we have some space to bring down the policy rate closer to neutral so that we can support the labor market.
4:04
Jen
Now, that's still not as much as Fed governor Steven Miron, who again reiterated to Bloomberg Television earlier today that rates in the range of four to four and a quarter are still highly restrictive and make the economy vulnerable to downside shocks. And remember Josh, Miron has pencilled in five more rate cuts for this year by far, the most dovish on the committee.
