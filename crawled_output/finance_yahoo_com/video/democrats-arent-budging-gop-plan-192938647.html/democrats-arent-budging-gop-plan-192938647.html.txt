Speaker A
and then everything else going on and we're going to talk about the Fed later on in this program. There was once again or has been once again over the last few weeks, uh talk of a US government shutdown. What's the latest on that? The developments there. And I guess I would follow with just sort of what your view is right now on like how the how the budget, like the fiscal position of the US government is now being used in this current political environment. Um, you know, by both parties, is it less intense than it was? and just what's the what's the state of play there? because the shutdown very scary, it's been used at various points in time, but just feels like it's an under the radar story now relative to, you know, prior news cycles.
01:00
Ben
For sure. Yeah, I think the the way to think about the shutdown phase at this point is that we're in the kind of staring contest, which we've been in a number of times over the last couple of years that has been resolved at the last minute. What analysts say is this time is different basically because each party is more motivated than most than than previous um standoffs to kind of to see a shutdown through. Uh what we saw today was essentially a concerted GOP effort to make their plan the the the one that that is the only viable option to extend the shutdown for just seven weeks, push the deadline from October 1st to November 21st, do a few smaller things like additional money for lawmaker security and say that's that's the only option. Democrats rejected that out of hand and what we saw that as a series of votes. It passed the house because the Senate the Republicans can do things unilaterally there. It was blocked in the Senate. So there's a lot of political theory here. But to your point about the kind of the fiscal part of this. I do think we're not talking about any kind of fiscal responsibility here. The the Republican plan the plan is to essentially extend it for six weeks or seven weeks as is at current spending levels. So there's there's very little conversation. they're attacking Democrats for wanting to spend more. but there is the bond market, you know, the markets are watching this aspect in sort of yet another round of government dysfunction and I think there's not a lot of wrestling with the overall fiscal problems that are are underlying these issues. Right now it's just essentially keeping the lights on for for seven weeks at a time. um not not addressing these underlying problems.
02:40
Speaker A
Ah, feels like the uh the 2013 era shutdown story. That's just never coming back. You know, this is just, you know, we're not going to do the coin anymore. We're just going to like let it bubble up and then move on. and you know, every so often we'll hear the words. All right. Uh Ben, thanks so much.
