How do Fed rate cuts impact consumers & businesses?
Yahoo Finance Video
and Josh Lipton
Thu, Sep 18, 2025, 7:30 AM
The Federal Reserve opted to cut interest rates by 25 basis points on Wednesday — the first rate cut of 2025. EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco joins Market Domination with Josh Lipton to explain how federal interest rates impact everyday consumers and businesses. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination.
Video Transcript

Speaker A
Greg, you know, let's say you're out and about and you meet somebody, maybe they're not even invested in the market. And they just asked you, Greg, as an economist, all right, you know, I heard the Fed made a move, they made a cut, they cut by 25, and they asked you to explain, Greg, just what impact that has on them and their family. How would you walk them through that?
00:20
Greg
I think Miro is absolutely correct that long-term rates matter a great deal. And Fed Chair Powell acknowledged that. He mentioned that the path, the trajectory, or the expected trajectory of the Fed funds rate matters really a great deal for consumers and for businesses because let's not forget, a lot of people borrow on long-term rates. If you're buying a house, what matters is long-term rates. If you're buying a car, usually it's medium-term rates.
00:46
Greg
Um so, those are the rates that influence private sector activity. Whether it's a consumer or the CEO of a large firm, they're going to be highly dependent on these longer-term rates. And that is a conundrum for the Fed because if markets anticipate that there will be a a lift up in longer-term rates because of the fiscal trajectory, because of a a question around Fed credibility and Fed independence,
01:10
Greg
because of a number of of uncertainties with regards to the policy trajectory, then you could have much less stimulus to the economy. And so that person in the street that's asking me, what does this do? It doesn't do a great deal in terms of supporting the economy. You'd actually need to be moving much closer to neutral to actually see a more significant buffer in terms of the downside risk to the labor market that Fed Chair Powell was highlighting.
