iPhone Air, iPhone 17: Why this is Apple's strongest lineup in years
Yahoo Finance Video
Wed, Sep 17, 2025, 8:00 AM
In this video:
AAPL
Apple (AAPL) debuted its newest iPhones, the iPhone 17 and iPhone Air, last week. Check out Yahoo Finance Tech Editor Dan Howley's review in the video above. Watch more Apple coverageThe newest features showcased for Apple iPhone 17, new devices 'Thin is in': iPhone Air could be glimpse into Apple's future Apple 'way behind' on AI. But maybe that's not a bad thing right now.
Video Transcript
00:00
Speaker A
The next generation of Apple iPhones are here. They include the iPhone Air as well as the standard iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Pros.
00:08
Speaker A
It's been about eight years since Apple launched the iPhone 10 in 2017. and since then, the design of its big-time phones have kind of stagnated.
00:18
Speaker A
Sure they've updated the inside with new chips, made their cameras better, but really the look and feel of the phones has remained mostly the same. until now.
00:26
Speaker A
There's a ton of big deal changes to this, but there are also a few tradeoffs. So let's go through them.
00:31
Speaker A
This is the iPhone Air. It is the latest iPhone, new design, incredibly thin at 5.6 mm and incredibly lightweight.
00:41
Speaker A
Now, I know those numbers might not sound big, but when you hold them next to something like the iPhone Pro Max, it really does feel like a different kind of device.
00:52
Speaker A
Uh inside the phone has Apple's new A19 Pro processor. Basically, it's the latest version of the chip that runs in all iPhones.
01:00
Speaker A
The Air, unlike the Pro or the standard iPhone 17 has just one rear lens.
01:07
Speaker A
So, it's not as though that's bad, but if you're the type of person that really likes to get a macro shot or really zoom in, that could be a a deal breaker for you.
01:15
Speaker A
On the 17, we have a standard zoom as well as an ultrawide, and then on the 17 Pro Max, we have a new 8X telephoto zoom, which is the furthest that Apple's offered so far.
01:26
Speaker A
And then up front, they have what's called a new center stage camera.
01:31
Speaker A
Now the big deal here is that unlike prior versions of the the front-facing selfie camera on the iPhone where you had to kind of turn it sideways to get a vertical view uh or rather a horizontal view, this does it automatically.
01:46
Speaker A
So you can just press a button and it'll immediately turn to landscape.
01:51
Speaker A
It's got a good decent amount of battery life, but the problem is that the 17 and 17 Pro also get big updates for their battery life. They're going to last uh with the 17 Pro Max up to about 39 hours.
02:05
Speaker A
One of the other things that I think is worth pointing out is all of these phones now come with Apple's iOS 26 and their new liquid glass design.
02:12
Speaker A
Finally, pricing, let's talk about that. The standard 17, that starts at 7.99 still, no difference, but you do get 256 GB of memory up from 128.
02:22
Speaker A
The air, that starts at 9.99. So, not exactly going to break the bank for a new design, very cool uh to see that. It's slightly more expensive though than the Plus was, which the air replaces.
02:35
Speaker A
The pros though get a little bit more expensive at the start. Instead of 9.99, it's now 10.99 for the base Pro and 11.99 for the Pro Max.
02:46
Speaker A
So not as much change as far as the pricing goes overall, but it's definitely something to keep in mind.
02:52
Speaker A
For my experience, I really like the air. I think the photo quality is great. I thought the battery life was great, especially compared to last year. Uh basically about the same performance.
03:02
Speaker A
So overall, it's a big moment for Apple. They're finally changing the design of the iPhone and
03:07
Speaker A
if they follow the same pattern that Samsung did, they released a super thin phone and then released a super thin foldable.
03:14
Speaker A
There have been rumors for a long time that Apple's working on a foldable and it just released its first super thin phone. So now we just have to see if there's a foldable in Apple's future.
