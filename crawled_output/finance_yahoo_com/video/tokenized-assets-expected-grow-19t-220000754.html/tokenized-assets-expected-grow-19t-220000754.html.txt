The tokenization of real-world assets (RWA) is on the rise as trading platforms like Robinhood Markets (HOOD) begin offering tokenized stocks to overseas investors. Yahoo Finance senior business reporter Ines Ferré explains tokenization and breaks down the Wall Street forecasts anticipating the market cap for tokenized assets to explode within the next 8 years. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Asking for a Trend.
Video Transcript

Josh
The tokenization of real world assets is accelerating and is expected to grow even further. Yahoo Finance's Ines Ferre joined us now with more. Ines.
00:15
Ines Ferre
Yeah, Josh, and first, let's start with what is the tokenization of a stock, for example. That is basically a stock which is issued on blockchain. That's the same technology on which crypto is based.
00:30
Ines Ferre
Industry insiders I have spoken with have said that eventually you will see the entire financial market run on blockchain. You started to see this with stable coins, and then now we're starting to see it with equities.
00:46
Ines Ferre
We've heard of the announcements of Robin Hood, uh introducing 200 US uh tokenized stocks in the EU, uh Gemini also offering tokenized stocks in the EU. Those are more derivative products that are not available in the US.
01:02
Ines Ferre
But you've had the Nasdaq that's has asked the SEC uh for permission to be able to offer tokenized uh shares, tokenized securities uh on the Nasdaq. And that's because of this wave of the entire financial infrastructure which is expected to upgrade to blockchain and they don't want to lose ground uh to platforms like Coinbase, like Kraken, like Gemini.
01:29
Ines Ferre
Uh this is a big market just to show you what one study shows is that real world assets, the market cap for real world assets is expected to go from 600 uh billion this year to about 19 trillion in 2033.
01:51
Ines Ferre
And we're not just talking about uh equities. We're also of course talking about bonds, gold, real estate, any type of real world asset that you can think of. Now, why would you want tokenized equities? Uh what is the benefit of them?
02:07
Ines Ferre
Well, they can be more easily uh traded. There's faster settlement times. Uh they can be split into smaller pieces, so you have more investors that are able to access these. They can be accessed from anywhere in the world and they can also be used as collateral.
02:27
Ines Ferre
I mean, I had one industry uh insider telling me, you can you'll be able to even swap. Let's say you want to uh dump Alphabet and buy Tesla. You'll be able to do that in one move. You won't have to sell one, wait for the settlement and then buy the other one.
02:50
Ines Ferre
Um the goal is to eventually have stocks like Tesla, like Amazon, like the Mag 7, all issuing those companies issuing their shares on blockchain.
03:04
Ines Ferre
The challenges of course are that you have uh settlement processes that have to be changed, clearing processes that have to be changed. These are a processes that can take uh days as far as settlement time. So all of that needs to be shifted to be changed and that is going to take some time.
03:26
Ines Ferre
Uh but this is definitely revolutionary as far as the financial market's concerned. In the end, everything is going to migrate. That is what Wall Street is betting on.
03:41
Josh
All right, thank you, Ines. Appreciate it.
03:43
Ines Ferre
Thank you.
