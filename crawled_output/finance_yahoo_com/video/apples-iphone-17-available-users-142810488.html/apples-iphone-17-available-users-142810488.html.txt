Video Transcript
00:08
Speaker A
Let's turn now to our stock of the day. Apple's new iPhone 17 and iPhone Air are officially available for consumers starting today. And according to research from start.io, the single most widely owned model across the US is an iPhone 13. So will consumers choose to upgrade?
00:27
Speaker A
Year to date, Apple has lagged some of its magnificent seven peers, falling about 5%. Still with me at Jeff Crumpleman, Brooke De Palma and Inez Ferre. So Jeff, given Apple's underperformance this year, how important is the success of this latest upgrade cycle or do investors not really care at this point? They're more focused on AI.
00:53
Jeff
Well, no, I think, you know, it it is very important. By the way, I I'd have to add, I have the iPhone 13.
01:02
Jeff
So, you know, um, I I get the risk is you feel like a luddite if you're several Why haven't you upgraded?
01:10
Speaker A
What's the problem here, Jeff?
01:13
Jeff
I know, exactly. I'm sure, you know, Tim Cook would wouldn't want me to to to hear me saying that. I don't know if that will reduce our access to, you know, management or not. But it has all the functionality that I want. I think that's part of the issue. You know, you're really seeing here not evolutionary, you know, AI type of, you know, major improvements here.
01:42
Jeff
You know, you got some improvements in form fa form factor and camera and and those types of things. So that's great, but it it doesn't force me to upgrade and and and you'll see, you know, therefore low, mid single digit growth, you know, in units. And, you know, as a result, I think it's very important to maintain the um high single digit earnings growth as a result of what that helps drive.
02:14
Jeff
You know, services is a big part of the the business, but you have to continue to see iPhone, you know, at at at decent levels. Um, I, you know, we we underown Apple relative to its weight in in the indices and um, I don't think you you don't want to own this company um because of its um ability to innovate and its services business.
02:49
Jeff
But it's it's, you know, trading at 30 times earnings with 8% growth rate and it's hard to get super excited, you know, about major outperformance um when it's at this this stage.
03:09
Speaker A
Now, despite Jeff not upgrading his iPhone, I have seen many photos of people lining out the door around the globe including China. And Inez, I'm curious what strategists are saying about China demand, especially since Apple has really struggled against some of those more local competitors like Huawei.
03:31
Inez
Yeah, um well, jd.com had uh put out some information about pre-orders and it had seen that pre-orders had surpassed uh the days before compared to last year for the iPhone 16. So for the 17, especially 17 Pro, seemed to outperform. So that is something positive. You also had uh B of A that talked about ship dates and that those have been extended uh in China.
04:02
Inez
And so that's positive for the region as well. But certainly, it is very, very competitive. And as far as the ship dates overall, B of A had also noted that it had seen extended times across the board. So that speaks to strong demand for the iPhone 17, the 17 Pro uh with some of the features that were just mentioned, like uh yeah, like strong longer battery life, um the uh slimmer phone.
04:36
Inez
So these are the features that not not only are they just attractive for consumers, but also the fact that the price point for the 17 is not that much from the previ previous one, that not much higher. So that would make consumers sort of switch to the 17. Uh but certainly, it is competitive, but but Wall Street seems to at this point be bullish.
