The Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates at its FOMC meeting this week, with Wall Street pricing in a cut of 25 basis points following the latest labor and inflation data. Yahoo Finance Markets and Data Editor Jared Blikre, who also hosts Yahoo Finance's Stocks in Translation podcast, breaks down the central bank's strategic reasons for rate policies, why the Fed may be behind the curve around rate cuts, and key indicators to monitor amid rate cuts.

Video Transcript
00:00
Speaker A
Fed week is here and one rate cut is the base case.
00:04
Speaker A
Maybe even two though. But the big question is not how many, it's the story.
00:09
Speaker A
Is the Fed taking a little insurance out or do they need a fire extinguisher because something's burning?
00:15
Speaker A
And that's what we're breaking down on today's stocks and translation.
00:19
Speaker A
First, a quick definition. A rate cut is when the Fed lowers its short-term policy rate, a single cut is 25 basis points or a quarter of a percentage point, and a double is twice that or 50 basis points.
00:32
Speaker A
And note that we're talking short-term rates only, not the ones that affect your mortgage.
00:38
Speaker A
And when it comes to rate cuts, there are two different flavors. First, there are insurance cuts. That's when the economy is okay, though it might be slowing down. Bank stocks and smaller company stocks are holding steady, and the Fed is cushioning risk early.
00:51
Speaker A
But sometimes the Fed is making a behind the curve cut. Data is worsening, credit gets nervous along with those bank stocks. In this scenario, the Fed is chasing a downturn in the making.
01:03
Speaker A
So let's set up these possibilities in a chart. This chart comes from Brian Levitt over at Invesco and it shows how the S&P 500 typically behaves around the start of a Fed rate cutting cycle going all the way back to 1970.
01:15
Speaker A
Note that horizontally, the chart begins 12 months before the first rate cut and extends to 12 months after that cut. Vertically tells you how much profit or loss is.
01:25
Speaker A
Now, the first scenario in white tracks what happens to stocks when the economy is already in recession when the cuts begin. That happened four times since 1970 and actually produces the best return, 28%, though it's a little bit bumpy after that first cut.
01:39
Speaker A
Secondly, the green line shows what happens when the economy falls into recession within a year after that first cut. This is the worst case scenario for stocks, which happened six times and produced an average loss of 13%.
01:50
Speaker A
Finally, in blue, we show what happened when there was no recession. This happened six times and boosted stocks by nearly 20%. It's also the smoothest sailing for stocks.
01:58
Speaker A
Unfortunately, we almost never know until we're in a recession or after it's already started and ended. So all we're showing with this chart is that stocks prefer fed insurance cuts and they don't like to see a recession sneak up.
02:10
Speaker A
But we can point to some markets that will give real-time indicators if the Fed is starting to lose control and becoming reactive instead of proactive. Now, right now markets are behaving like there's an insurance setup.
02:22
Speaker A
In this chart, we're showing three things that are interest sensitive, small caps, bank stocks and home builders.
02:27
Speaker A
critically, all of these have been heading higher over the last three months. But according to Michael Hartnett's team over at B of A, there are some key levels to watch in two of these. For the Russell 2000, tracking small caps, watch the 2400 level. Right now we're just barely above it.
02:42
Speaker A
Ideally, you're going to see this market rally from here, but if it decisively breaks below 2400, that means there are some problems, says Hartnett. Then watch the KBW Bank Index. It's just over 150 now and we don't want to see it below 140.
02:57
Speaker A
Simple enough. You can monitor both of these on the Yahoo Finance site and mobile app.
03:02
Speaker A
And finally, B of A says it's important to watch corporate credit, specifically something called the IGCDX index, which heads higher when companies are facing borrowing stress. If you don't have access to it, access to it, just watch out for headlines that are about corporate credit breaking down.
03:17
Speaker A
Now, here's a recap of what to watch next. One, pay attention to those critical levels in small caps and bank stocks. Then watch the Fed decision this Wednesday.
03:27
Speaker A
If the Fed goes double, guess what? That might mean they're a bit fearful and behind the curve. Then watch those jobs reports. Last week, the weekly unemployment insurance number, it jumped to a four-year high. If that current, if that trend continues, watch out.
03:42
Speaker A
And finally, pay attention to headlines about corporate credit freezing up because right now, money is flowing like water. Bottom line is rate cuts are not necessarily a free lunch, so context matters when it comes to what the Fed decides this Wednesday.
03:55
Speaker A
And tune into Stocks and Translation the podcast for more jargon busting deep dives. New episodes can be found Tuesdays and Thursdays on Yahoo Finance's website or wherever you find your podcast.
