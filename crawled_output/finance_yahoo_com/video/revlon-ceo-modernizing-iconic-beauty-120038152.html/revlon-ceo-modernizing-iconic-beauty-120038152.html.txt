Video Transcript
00:00
Speaker A
Revlon, uh, prior to you arriving, went through its troubles. Went into bankruptcy, out of bankruptcy, then you came in, and now you're leading the the the the turn of this big ship.
00:10
Speaker B
Yeah, well I
00:11
Speaker A
Well that well how did you like what do you what's your agenda? When you came in that first six months, how do you say, I want to just reboot this iconic company. What's the playbook?
00:19
Speaker B
Yeah, well let's start with why I came, right? I mean, first of all, these these brands, I was at CBS, and everybody wants Revlon to succeed. Everybody wants a really healthy beauty aisle and and Revlon whether it's in hair care or skin care, you know, or or color cosmetics, is is part of that. I remember, as I think pretty much every woman in America remembers, you know, crawling into her mother's makeup case for the first time and seeing those kind of Revlon lipsticks. And so, uh these are brands that have been around and have been so deeply authentic for so long.
00:46
Speaker B
So when I think about the growth agenda for Revlon, it's really category by category. We compete in four main categories. The first one that I I'll talk about is hair care. And what's exciting about hair care and and really all the categories is these are growth markets. Every single category we compete in is growing mid high single digits. And so beauty is resilient. In hair care, what you're seeing from consumers is the ritualization, the skinification of hair care. Gone are the days when you use one shampoo, one conditioner.
01:21
Speaker A
Skinification. I like that.
01:22
Speaker B
Skinification of hair, right? So now you've got your scalp treatment and your your, you know, your end treatment, your root treatment. And so women and men, we have American Crew is one of our brands, are using more and more routines. So we're taking our portfolio often from the salon with our Revlon Professional portfolio, bringing it to more and more consumers around the world. And it's the perfect time to do it because we have really science-backed innovation.
01:43
Speaker B
For color cosmetics, this is the aisle we all know and love when we walk into our Walmart and Target and CVS.
01:51
Speaker A
I I understand. I wear TV makeup. I'm not wearing lipstick, but I'm just, look, I get it.
