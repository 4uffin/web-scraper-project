Powell highlights labor market weakness: What's next for the Fed
Yahoo Finance Video
Tue, September 23, 2025 at 2:30 PM CDT
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell says the central bank faces "no risk-free path" when it comes to monetary policy after the Fed's September rate cut. Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Claire Boston breaks down the latest. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination.
Video Transcript
00:00
Speaker A
What we've done all year this year is we've had policy our policy rate has been tight because inflation has been above our target, but the labor market was very solid. Now, over the last really four months, really over the summer, the labor market has softened, payroll jobs have dropped a lot, so we can't really say that anymore.
00:23
Claire Boston
Yeah, so Powell has a really tricky job right here because he is trying to balance this weaker labor market with the fact that inflation is still pretty high. He also has to wrangle all of these Fed governors who have frankly different views about what to do from here. And it's not really clear if as of course he says, you know, what the right thing to do in this moment is. So, you know, they say they're going to stay data dependent. They're really going to watch what's going on. You know, we'll see from here.
00:54
Speaker C
Yeah, and it's it's interesting watching the Fed, um, not just change I mean, I think what's interesting is how maybe five, six, eight years ago, Fed governors come and go. You think, ah, a new person on the Fed. Oh, here's their background. It's not that interesting. But now, obviously, Stephen Myron joining the Fed board last week, potential other changes in the offing. Uh, it feels like there's less cohesion and maybe perhaps Powell's comments are more like they're more his own. It's sort of how I felt he was speaking today than in the past where the Fed chair is obviously super cognizant of the fact that they are by far the most important voice. Not to say he's unimportant at this point, but um he feels like, uh, it feels like Powell on on speaking on Powell rather than Powell on behalf of everybody else.
01:40
Claire Boston
Definitely. There is not really a clear consensus view right now. You know, we're seeing a lot of Fed speak as you alluded to this week. You know, many Fed governors were saying that they're still pretty worried about where inflation is, and I'm really curious to see, you know, how that factors into this October meeting that we have. Um, you know, the governors, of course, were penciling in a cut, you know, at this meeting. But, uh, you know, we are going to get quite a bit more data between now and then, and we'll have to see sort of where things shake out with some of that inflation data.
02:12
Speaker C
And the other thing that he said, um, quickly before we go, was talking about, uh, the stock market and kind of saying, you know, things are high. I see them. I see them out there. Don't worry. Don't don't think I'm ignoring it. Um, and I'm I always take note when, uh, I mean, look, he's asked the question, he answers the question. Um, but it is interesting how Powell seems to be willing to acknowledge the thing. I mean, prior Fed chairs have said, you know, this is not something that is in my world. Um, but just coming out and kind of acknowledging those risks, let's say.
02:44
Claire Boston
Yeah, for sure. I mean, you know, I think he is very careful when he does it. He says, you know, the Fed is not in charge of the stock market. But, um, you know, that being said, it is hard to ignore in this moment. And it's a bit odd, you know, when you think about it, he's very concerned about labor, and yet, you know, stocks are ripping here. So, um, you know, I think it makes him seem kind of human that he's willing to acknowledge the weirdness in this market right now.
03:07
Speaker C
Claire Boston, appreciate it.
03:08
Claire Boston
Thank you.
