The US's TikTok deal will reportedly include Oracle (ORCL), TikTok's parent company ByteDance, and new investors, according to CNBC. The US government has also extended the deadline for ByteDance to sell the app until Dec. 16. Yahoo Finance Technology Editor Dan Howley joins Market Domination host Josh Lipton with the latest.

Josh
framework for a potential TikTok deal will include Chinese parent company Bite Dance and Oracle, as well as new investors, that's according to reports from CNBC. The US also extending now the deadline on Tuesday for China to sell the social media app until December 16th. For more, we're bringing in Yahoo Finance's very own tech editor, Dan Howley. Dan.
00:22
Dan Howley
Yeah, Josh, this is coming together in in multiple stages. We saw uh President Trump uh truth, I guess is what you would call it as post on Truth Social. Uh that they had some kind of agreement for an app that young people would be interested in. Uh then later uh basically saying, yes, we have a framework for uh some kind of uh reconciliation with regards to the US and Tik Tok and China.
00:54
Dan Howley
Uh and so now we're we're seeing more reports coming out about what that could look like. Uh part of it would be uh uh 80% or so would be owned by US entities, uh less than 20% uh or roughly under 20% would be owned by China. So or or Chinese uh prior Chinese owner. So that's what the law has uh in the original or the original law states that uh Chinese entities can't own more than 20% of Tik Tok or it gets shut down.
01:31
Dan Howley
Um that was supposed to happen in January. And it did for like, you know, a few hours. Um and then it's just been kind of, you know, we've been rolling this, you know, along for for however long it took to get to this point. Uh apparently Trump and uh President Xi Jinping, Xi Jinping are supposed to meet on Friday to discuss this, kind of finalize it and I don't know, maybe they'll get on Tik Tok together and go live or something uh and say, we've saved the app. Uh they could
02:04
Josh
That would be good television. Oh yeah.
02:06
Dan Howley
Oh yeah, it'd be amazing. Yeah. Um but it it does seem as though that's going to be kind of where this goes. Um, you know, uh it's obviously been a big back and forth. Uh there's been concern about uh cyber security or the security of US users, their data, what does that mean then? Uh if we're going to see that become a US uh uh property.
02:30
Dan Howley
I think it's still kind of up in the air. Sure their data isn't going to be an issue. Uh it's going to be held in the US. But, you know, part of part of this concern was, which is by the way, just been so uh poorly described. This this concern about data. No one's ever really given us a straight answer from the government. It's just been this kind of they're going to get you.
03:00
Dan Howley
I don't know who they is, the Chinese government, are they going to know that I look at videos of toys from the 1990s. I mean, big deal, you got me. Um but part of the problem is going to be uh potential Chinese influence campaigns and their ability to influence public opinion, maybe use it as soft power, get people to like China more. Uh the thing is they can do that on other platforms and they do. They do uh you know, it on uh Instagram, they'll do it uh on YouTube. It's not something that's difficult to, you know, buy an ad campaign and, you know, jush it up and say, okay, you know, China's pretty rad. Um and so that's something that I think, you know, still needs to be explained. I don't think we're ever going to get that now at this point about what the old fear of Tik Tok was, but it does appear as though we're now going to potentially, you know, barring any kind of uh wild changes, see Tik Tok uh continue in the US uh going forward.
