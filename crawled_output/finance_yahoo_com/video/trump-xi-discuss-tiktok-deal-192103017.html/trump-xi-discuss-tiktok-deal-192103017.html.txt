Speaker A
For more on that call between Presidents Trump and Xi, Ben Werth will joins us now. Ben, let's just start with the initial readout we got um from the two leaders this morning.
00:09
Ben Werth
Yeah, so um so from this call we got two kind of major headlines from both sides uh of this call. The first is about in in-person meetings. We we've been kind of waiting for Trump and she to actually meet in person and we now know exactly when that's going to occur. It's the end of next month at a summit in South Korea. Trump even talked about potentially having uh visits to China and to the United States from President she uh starting next year. So that's that's the first step of kind of continued talks. And then the second headline is the closely watched Tik Tok conversation. Trump, the way Trump described it, the word he used was an approval, an approval of this idea of spinning off Tik Tok into the US. It's worth noting though that the stories we're hearing from the different sites here tend to differ a bit. Trump talks about an approval, what he talked about earlier this week was all US investors taking ownership of at least Tik Tok's operations in the US. The Chinese offered a very different message in their in the Chinese State media summary of of the call. Talking about being open to kind of commercial solutions to this, but having continued Chinese investment or at least interested in Chinese investment. A third wing of this too importantly, you see on the screen there is from Bite Dance itself. They released their own statement talking about how um as you can see, to ensure Tik Tok remains available to American users through Tik Tok US. That is a kind of another kind of scenario here, essentially describing the status quo. So, there there's ways to square these different circles, but you know, there's talk of kind of licensing Tik Tok's algorithm to a separate US-based company, but it but needless to say, there's a lot of details still to be worked out here and it's going to be kind of complicated implementation even if there's kind of overall approval of this deal.
