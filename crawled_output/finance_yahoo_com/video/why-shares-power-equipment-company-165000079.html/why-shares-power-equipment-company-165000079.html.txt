Video Transcript
00:00
Speaker A
We've been examining the theme of power needs for AI all week. Today we're looking at American superconductors. It works to deliver gigawatts of renewable power around the world while strengthening grid reliability across more than a dozen countries. And rising energy demand has sent AMSC's shares up more than 120% this year. Joining me now, Daniel McGan, president, chairman and CEO of American Superconductor. It's good to have you back with us here in the studio. So, um, it's been a while since we talked. So I always like to remind folks
00:46
Speaker A
what it is American superconductor does. And we talk about semiconductors very frequently. We less frequently talk about superconductors, which are basically more like a traditional conductor you might learn about in physics class, chemistry class. I don't know. I'm taking I'm taking my brain way back. So, um what are the most of the products that you guys are making?
01:21
Daniel McGahn
Yeah. Really think about us more is about power control company, more than just superconductors. Superconductor is one modality that we can use, but we use a lot of different technology within the company. Um so we provide kind of reliable high-quality power to the grid connecting either industrial or power generation to the grid. And then we have a part of our business now that's more direct power supply. So the kind of the power control, kind of the version of this for big industrial equipment.
01:57
Speaker A
Um, and we have obviously talked a lot of here every day about hyperscalers, about data centers, about the power needs that they have. In the last segment we were just talking about where that power is coming from in terms of power source. You're then part of how they get there. So, how has this affected your business?
02:22
Daniel McGahn
Yeah, we think it has the potential to affect it pretty dramatically. So that we're asking the grid to do a lot of things it's just not designed to do. Um, there's a lot of industrial capacity for manufacturing that's starting to scale and ramp in this country. Uh, AI and the and semiconductors and chips even in semi that's been driving our business. We just had a record quarter this past quarter. I mean really across the board it was almost a near perfect quarter because we see a lot of demand starting to accelerate in the business and that's been beneficial to us. We really service that interconnection between the grid and where the power either comes from or where it needs to go.
03:07
Speaker A
Um, as you said, we're asking the grid to do a lot that it isn't, you know, it wasn't built to do. So, how far can it go with products like yours to without sort of wholesale um, reconstruction of things?
03:31
Daniel McGahn
Yeah. Yeah. And that's really kind of part of our strategy is the power control products are to make the grid today work how it needs to work. And then the superconductor technology we think is a long-term future and that really building the grid to to service the needs today in a more uh dramatic, more dynamic uh longer-term way. So that's kind of on our road map, but we think in terms of years to decades now in how we try to evolve our our overall business.
04:06
Speaker A
And so what does that what does that timeline look like? Where are we on that?
04:09
Daniel McGahn
Um, so I think when it comes to the demand for uh chips and the demand for AI, we're probably in the early innings at the very beginning. Uh I think there's a lot of rhetoric around capital that could be deployed in that area. Even if it's a fraction of what's considered, the grid really needs to be adapted to be able to get um the power to where it's needed, when it's needed. And that's really where we come in either providing the power quality quality equipment or the power control equipment.
