What Stephen Miran's Fed confirmation could mean for rate cuts
Yahoo Finance Video
Tue, Sep 16, 2025, 2:24 PM
On Monday, Senate lawmakers confirmed Stephen Miran — who was nominated by President Trump — to the Federal Reserve Board ahead of the central bank's September FOMC meeting this week. Yahoo Finance senior Fed reporter Jennifer Schonberger explains what Miran's addition to the Fed Board could mean for the interest rate cut expected by Wall Street.
Miran currently acts as the chair to the White House Council of Economic Advisers, which has given lawmakers and regulators concerns around maintaining Fed independence from the executive branch. Also catch StoneX's Jon Hilsenrath and S&P Global Ratings' Paul Gruenwald emphasize the goal of avoiding policy mistakes as the Trump administration works to replace top Fed officials.

Video Transcript
00:00
Speaker A
The Senate confirming Stephen Myron to the Federal Reserve Board last night just in time for the Federal Reserve's policy meeting which kicked off earlier today. Now we know that Myron is a dove and we expect the Central Bank to cut its benchmark policy rate by 25 basis points on Wednesday. The question is whether Myron will go along with that cut or whether he will dissent because he would prefer to cut by a larger amount.
00:28
Speaker A
He is just one vote of the 12 voting members of the 19 member FOMC committee who cast a vote. But Myron said that he would not resign from his White House post as the President's Council of Economic Advisors chairman because he says he is only serving a stint of four and a half months at the Fed. Therefore, he will return to the White House after serving at the Central Bank.
00:50
Speaker A
Something that has raised a flag of concern for Democrats over Central Bank independence. In fact, ahead of Myron's confirmation, Democrats sent a letter to Myron asking him to resign if he was confirmed by the Senate and asking him whether he would share any conversations he would have as a Federal Reserve governor with President Trump with congressional members, with lawmakers, both of which he said he would not do.
01:16
Speaker A
Meanwhile, the President is uh I should say Myron's confirmation comes as President Trump is seeking to fill the Central Bank with people who are in favor of lower interest rates. When President Trump was asked whether he favors an independent Central Bank, he told reporters this upon leaving the White House this morning to go to the UK.
01:42
President Donald Trump
It should be, but I think they should listen to smart people like me. I think I have a better instinct than him. If you look all the economists got it wrong. I got it right along with one other people out of 100. So they should listen to people that are smart. There's nothing wrong with that, but they have to make their own choice, but they should listen.
02:02
Speaker A
The President tried to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook from the Fed board ahead of today's policy meeting, but an appeals court has rejected that. The administration expected to appeal that to the Supreme Court.
