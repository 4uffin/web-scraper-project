Video Transcript
00:00
Speaker A
We are kicking off this week with Pop's playbook where I take a look at some of the biggest headlines in sports that you and your portfolio need to know.
00:05
Speaker A
First up, let's talk about the US Open with the 2025 tournament ending earlier this month. The USDA says it drew a record 1.1 million fans over two weeks.
00:13
Speaker A
Now, we'll get the full revenue numbers later this year. But with record attendance, the USDA is likely to surpass its 2024 revenue of $620 million. About 40% of that comes from ticket sales.
00:23
Speaker A
With sponsorships, hospitality, merchandise and broadcast rights making up the rest. However, while the US Open is becoming more popular, it's also about to get more expensive.
00:30
Speaker A
The USTA is currently working on an $800 million renovation plan that will remove 2,800 cheaper upper bowl seats to add two levels of new luxury suites.
00:40
Speaker A
Next up, let's talk about Netflix. The world's largest streaming platform says it drew over 41 million global viewers for last weekend's boxing match between Terence Crawford and Canelo Alvarez.
00:51
Speaker A
Now, we all know that Netflix is taking sports more seriously. The addition of an ad supported subscription plan has prompted the company to do a 180 on its sports strategy.
01:00
Speaker A
But the more interesting angle to me is what this means for the future of pay-per-view.
01:04
Speaker A
The UFC just ditched pay-per-view for a $7.7 billion media rights deal with Paramount. and now Netflix is drawing over 41 million global viewers for a boxing match.
01:12
Speaker A
So, if streaming platforms can pay more money for the same reach, pay-per-view might officially be dead.
01:16
Speaker A
Speaking of Netflix, I also want to talk about some potential changes coming to how companies report quarterly earnings. For those who aren't up to speed,
01:23
Speaker A
The Trump administration is pushing the SEC to ship public companies from reporting earnings quarterly to just twice a year.
01:30
Speaker A
If this change is approved, it would align US rules with those of many other countries, allowing executives to focus more on long-term strategy rather than short-term results.
01:39
Speaker A
However, it could also have a major impact on various companies in the sports industry. Brands like Disney, Netflix, Nike,
01:45
Speaker A
FanDuel, and the UFC all have seasonal trends that already complicate reporting.
01:50
Speaker A
And last up in today's playbook is news that Tom Brady is coming out of retirement. Well, kind of.
01:55
Speaker A
The seven-time Super Bowl champion announced this week that he will be competing in the inaugural Fanatics Flag Football Classic in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia next year.
02:03
Speaker A
Joining Brady in Saudi Arabia will be NFL coaches Pete Carroll, Sean Peyton and Kyle Shanahan, as well as NFL players like Saquon Barkley, Christian Mry, Tyrie Kill,
02:12
Speaker A
Odell Beckham Jr. and Rob Gonkowski. And to add even more star power to the broadcast on Fox, comedian Kevin Hart will serve as host of the event.
