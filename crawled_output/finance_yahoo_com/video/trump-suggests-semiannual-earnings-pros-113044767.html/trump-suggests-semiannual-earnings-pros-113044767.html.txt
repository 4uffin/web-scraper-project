Trump suggests semi-annual earnings: Pros & cons
Yahoo Finance Video
September 17, 2025
President Trump recently suggested that companies should report earnings results semiannually rather than quarterly. Yahoo Finance Markets and Data Editor Jared Blikre, who also hosts Yahoo Finance's Stocks in Translation podcast, breaks down financial reporting and discusses what semiannual reporting would mean for markets.

Video Transcript
00:00
Speaker A
What if earning season only came twice per year instead of every quarter?
00:06
Speaker A
It's a simple question with some big ramifications, and that's what we're exploring on today's Stocks in Translation.
00:12
Speaker A
President Trump sparked the debate on Monday on Truth Social, saying that subject to SEC approval, companies should no longer be forced to report on a quarterly basis, but rather on a six-month basis.
00:23
Speaker A
He said quote, this will save money and allow managers to focus on properly running their companies.
00:30
Speaker A
Now, first, let's break down what financial reporting actually is.
00:34
Speaker A
This is the required scorecard, what a company earns, spent, owns, owes, and what's changed, so that investors can gauge performance and risks.
00:44
Speaker A
Importantly, this does not include expectations for the future or so-called forward guidance. Look ahead targets and commentary are entirely optional, as they always have been.
00:52
Speaker A
Now, let's rewind the tape and start at the beginning in 1934, when the Securities and Exchange Commission got the power to require periodic reports.
01:00
Speaker A
It wasn't until 1955 that they actually gave a timeline, which was every six months.
01:05
Speaker A
Then in 1970, the 10Q was born, which had to be filed every quarter.
01:10
Speaker A
This also happened in Europe. Then in 2013 and 14, European and UK companies, they got some relief and were allowed to step down to every six months.
01:19
Speaker A
But not many took advantage. A few years later, a study found that only 9% of UK companies actually reduced their reporting.
01:27
Speaker A
Finally in our timeline, in 2018, back in the US, President Trump asked the SEC in his first term to gather comments from the public on stepping down to six months in the US.
01:36
Speaker A
At the time, many corporate leaders weighed in, including the Business round table and then Pepsico CEO Indra Noyi. Uh they largely favored cutting down the reporting to be able to focus on the long game.
01:47
Speaker A
But the point is, this issue has been around for years.
01:50
Speaker A
Now let's set the stakes.
01:52
Speaker A
If we cut reporting to twice a year, we're essentially trading less corporate homework for less information.
01:58
Speaker A
That can feel great in the sea suite, but how does it play for investors?
02:02
Speaker A
Well, let's focus on the pros first. Fewer filings can mean lower prep time and costs, meaning less make the quarter scrambles and more time running the business.
02:11
Speaker A
For cons, there are fewer timely updates for shareholders, as well as bigger information gaps which can favor insiders and pros.
02:19
Speaker A
And it can also make raising money harder. Think of it as the price of money going up when investors see less.
02:25
Speaker A
Now, what is the research say? Let's dig into that.
02:29
Speaker A
One study found that more reporting means smaller jumps in price when financials are reported and that it led to cheaper fundraising.
02:37
Speaker A
But another study on smaller companies in Singapore found that making them report each quarter lowered their market value due to the higher cost.
02:46
Speaker A
Another found that stepping down from quarterly to semi-annual led to less analyst coverage, which can disadvantage smaller investors.
02:54
Speaker A
And finally, a study found that less frequent reporting led to bigger information gaps.
03:00
Speaker A
Translation, the average evidence cuts both ways. Smaller companies can struggle with the burden, but markets generally like timely information and context matters.
03:09
Speaker A
So what happens next? Here's your road map.
03:13
Speaker A
First, watch the long-term stock exchange or LTSE, which has been vocal recently and is expected to petition the SEC.
03:20
Speaker A
It's backed by founders Fund, co-founded by Peter Thiel and Andreison Horwitz. Expect a pitch framed around long-termism, as the name would imply.
03:28
Speaker A
Second, watch the SEC's path.
03:31
Speaker A
The agency already gathered comments in 2018 and it could now go straight to a proposal, but it could also run another comment period.
03:39
Speaker A
Third, watch for investor pushback. Groups that prioritize transparency and fairness, they're going to weigh in fast.
03:45
Speaker A
If you manage other people's money, you want frequent comparable data.
03:50
Speaker A
And fourth, keep an eye out for white papers. If rule making moves, expect think tanks and consultancies to drop fresh studies about costs, liquidity and how investors, how often investors really need updates.
04:00
Speaker A
The bottom line is there are big tradeoffs here involved, but we're going to keep tracking this issue as it evolves now that it's got some steam in it again.
04:09
Speaker A
And tune in to the Stocks and Translation podcast for more jargon busting deep dives, new episodes can be found on Tuesdays and Thursdays on Yahoo Finance's website or wherever you find your podcast.
