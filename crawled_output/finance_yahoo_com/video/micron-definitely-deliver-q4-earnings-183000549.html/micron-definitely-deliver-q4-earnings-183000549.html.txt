Julie
I want to switch gears and talk about another big tech story that we're watching and that is Micron, which is set to report after the close on Tuesday. Last week, um it had a 12 session winning streak that just ended on Friday. Um that was a record uh for the stock. So obviously there's some enthusiasm going into these earnings. Do you think they'll be able to deliver?
00:26
Speaker B
So Julie, they will definitely be able to deliver. The question is going to be will it be above expectations? And as you mentioned, the stock has run up quite a bit. They pre-announced in August, which set the stage for a a big beat uh that investors are expecting. So we are not involved right now for that reason. Expec- expectations are a little bit ahead of where we think results will will come in. But if you look at the broad data center landscape, everybody had blowout results this quarter. So I think any pullback would be an opportunity uh to for investors to to get involved.
01:03
Julie
Well, and it's interesting when we talk about the the large kept the large cap tech landscape and how companies are monetizing AI, um you know, even if it's not their main business. And Micron's an interesting case of that with its high bandwidth memory chips because it is actually selling into specifically that AI market.
01:29
Speaker B
Absolutely. And I think what's even more interesting is that memory and networking is really where a lot of the performance improvement comes from. So this is why a lot of the networking plays are doing really well this year and same as memory where it's really a critical component in getting better performance out of the GPUs for the AI trade.
