In this video:
NVDA
China has instructed its biggest tech firms to stop buying Nvidia (NVDA) chips and terminate existing orders, Stubhub prepares for its first day of trading after raising $800 million in an IPO, and President Trump arrives in the UK as American top AI companies including Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOGL), OpenAI and CoreWeave (CRWV) announce investments in Britain as part of a $54 billion tech pact. Ramzan Karmali has the three things you need to know today. For more live coverage of markets watch the full episode of Market Sunrise and head to Yahoo Finance.
Video Transcript
00:06
Speaker A
Well, the first thing you need to know about is breaking news out of China. The internet regulator there has told the country's biggest tech firms to stop buying Nvidia's AI chips and terminate existing orders. That's according to the Financial Times.
00:20
Speaker A
This is seen as part of Beijing's efforts to boost its homegrown chip sector in order to compete with the US.
00:27
Speaker A
ByteDance and Alibaba this week were told to end their testing and orders of the RTX Pro 6000D, Nvidia's tailor-made product for the country introduced just two months ago.
00:41
Speaker A
Well, the ban goes beyond earlier guidance from regulators that had focused on the H20, Nvidia's other China only chip widely used for AI.
00:49
Speaker A
Meanwhile, Tik Tok's US arm looks set to be bought by a consortium that includes Oracle, Andreison Horowitz and private equity firm Silver Lake Management.
00:59
Speaker A
The next thing you need to know about is that another IPO has been priced and will start trading today. Online ticket platform StubHub priced its IPO at $23.50. That was the midpoint of the expected range, giving the firm a value of 8.6 billion dollars.
01:14
Speaker A
Look out for the ticker, S T U B.
01:17
Speaker A
Well, the IPO market has bounced back in recent months after an extended dry spell due to high inflation and rising interest rates.
01:28
Speaker A
And the last thing you need to know about is President Trump's state visit to the UK. Well, to mark the event, the two countries have agreed a tech prosperity deal with an estimated value of 42 billion dollars.
01:42
Speaker A
Among the major investments promised, Microsoft says it will spend around 30 billion dollars expanding cloud and AI infrastructure in the UK.
01:51
Speaker A
Google's promised almost $7 billion in spending on a new data center and AI research, and Nvidia said it would deploy 120,000 advanced chips across the country.
02:02
Speaker A
On the flip side, British pharmaceutical firm GSK said it will invest $30 billion in US research and development and supply chain infrastructure over five years.
02:14
Speaker A
Well, to get into this in more detail, let's speak to Jace Terrel. He's CEO of Opportunity London. His organization promotes sustainable investment into real estate in London.
02:24
Speaker A
Jace, thanks so much for joining us. Well, let's start with how important this visit actually is in attracting new investment into London and the UK. Who are the winners and where's where's this going to actually create jobs?
02:37
Jace Terrel
Well, look, the US is our most important global trading partner for London and the UK, across real estate, across foreign direct investment.
02:46
Jace Terrel
So look, it's a really important trip and probably we'll get a lot more traction on the trade side with this visit than perhaps on the other matters of foreign policy that are going on around the world. So I think certainly there's winners in London and in the UK and as you're just reporting, that investment by the AI companies and the R&D piece is really key for us. And I think in London there's a huge supply chain and global talent that's based that's going to benefit from that as well.
03:09
Jace Terrel
So look, big numbers, big commitments and we'll see the flows of that over the next decade here in London as well.
03:14
Speaker A
But if they're giving with one hand with the likes of, you know, Microsoft and Nvidia and Google, they're going to take in return as well. So the UK is going to have to give up something here too. What I mean, we've heard about GSK, but are there other UK firms that will have to do something for the US as well?
03:29
Jace Terrel
Yeah, look, I think that's all part of the bargaining at the moment. We've seen quite a shift even in the last couple of weeks in some of those big farmer decision and what's happening there as well. But I think for London and the UK, some of the winning bits from our side, yes, it's the American firms scaling their investment here, but actually there's a huge amount of infrastructure that needs to be built out through that, whether it's power, resilience, uh, and I think there's a lot of US companies that want to get more into the market here for the PPPs, energy space as well.
03:52
Jace Terrel
So I think that's going to be an opportunity. I think the US is going to ride on the back of with these big commitments from these data and AI companies.
04:02
Speaker A
seem to have noticed that the UK is trying its best to attract these big, well-known established companies to invest here, rather than build their own firms from scratch like they do possibly in mainland Europe. Is that really the right approach? Should we not be focusing more on building here rather than trying to attract these mega companies from the US?
04:21
Jace Terrel
I think it's a mix. I mean, I'll speak more on London than the rest of the country, but you know, we are the most globally traded city in the world here in London, and I think it's a combination as you say of those inward investment companies growing here and attracting those. But there's also a huge push here to expand. And remember London has, you know, a number of uniform companies, the most in Europe actually from here as well. So I think actually it's a dynamic marketplace of inbound and outbound that can only serve us better.
04:50
Jace Terrel
I think other parts of Europe are having to work hard obviously to home grown their their companies of the future where we're obviously a dynamic company of both import and export on that side.
05:01
Speaker A
IPO in New York. and in fact, it's been a pretty busy couple of weeks for IPOs in New York. Is there a is it is it worrying? Is London losing its allure in attracting these IPOs in comparison to New York and say Singapore?
05:12
Jace Terrel
We've seen a shift for a while, haven't we with the trend here? And I think the point is global capital companies you have a choice, you know, where they want to list, what the benefits are of that. I think we're very live to that in London. I think the LSC understands this. I think a lot's riding I think on the fiscal policy, you know, budgets coming up for us here in the UK and those incentives.
05:28
Jace Terrel
So I think there'll be a lot of eyes on the Treasury uh and the chancellor I'd imagine looking at this and thinking about that. But I wouldn't rule London out. I mean, you know, it's been trading for many, many decades, highly successful for a lot of those companies. And of course from a real estate side where we sit, we are as I said, the most traded global real estate city in the world and we're sort of up nearly 20% on last year and we'll hit about 15 billion this year in trade on real estate. So there's certainly winners from from that bit of the market from our side.
