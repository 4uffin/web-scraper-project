Video Transcript
00:03
Speaker A
Now it's time for some of today's trending tickers. We are watching Elf Beauty, General Mills, and Cracker Barrel. First up, Elf Beauty, the company getting a price target boost over at Bank of America. Joining us to talk about it, Yahoo Finance's Brooke De Palma. And this has to do with the new beauty intro, I think, right?
00:15
Brooke De Palma
Yeah, Rhode, Halle Bieber's company really showing some potential to really kick start Elf Beauty. Right now, the stock is up about 2%. It jumped as much as 5% this morning. And this was based upon a note from Bank of America out this morning that really led to the growth potential that Rhode could provide for Elf Beauty. They said that uh right now, Elf uh Rhode rather, uh saw Sephora's largest brand launch and essentially Elf will then benefit from Rhode's placement in Sephora stores, post inventory, so once it sort of rolls through the inventory that's already in there. But they did say that Bank of America adjusting its fiscal year 2026 growth to 26% versus their prior forecast of what's 25%. But really the strong brand launch around Rhode is what's really driving this price target raise from Bank of America this morning.
00:57
Speaker A
Interesting. And and Elf's done all right this year. The shares had had dipped, but then they've come back.
01:02
Brooke De Palma
Yeah. Well, largely because we we heard them say that they're going to raise prices by a dollar effective August 1st. And that's when you started to saw this momentum. Keep in mind they do get a majority of their goods from China. They said they have plans to offset that, but that was really sort of the turbulence that we saw earlier this year.
01:13
Speaker A
Yeah, still viewed though as sort of like a value-priced brand.
01:18
Brooke De Palma
Yeah, Rhode though, $32 for one of their products.
01:21
Speaker A
Which one How much is 32?
01:22
Brooke De Palma
$32 for their for their glazing milk.
01:25
Speaker A
Which one Which is an interesting thing.
01:25
Brooke De Palma
So, kind of reaching this this higher income audience.
01:28
Speaker A
I'm sorry, their what? Glazing
01:29
Brooke De Palma
Glazing milk for the big 4.2 oz. So, really reaching a higher income audience here perhaps, too.
01:34
Speaker A
Is that a fancy way of saying moisturizer?
01:36
Brooke De Palma
Moisturizer, yep, essential.
01:37
Speaker A
I don't use moisturizer. I use glazing milk. All right, let's stop, let's talk about General Mills. How are we rebranding cereal now? That's my question. Um the maker of cereal like Cheerios, citing a cautious outlook for the consumer in its latest earnings. So I I need to think about that. What would you call cereal if it wasn't
01:55
Brooke De Palma
Breakfast optimization.
01:58
Speaker A
Price pack architecture is all we're hearing about.
02:00
Brooke De Palma
Okay. I mean, they're thinking about because keep in mind, General Mills isn't just cereal. They also have like Tostinos. So they're talking about moving that into a box instead of a bag to really price pack architecture, really show more value.
02:12
Speaker A
I'm learning all the jargon.
02:13
Brooke De Palma
That's that's that's all the jargon we're getting today. But really there is, you know, mixed response right now to this report. It's down about 3/10 of percent, but largely what we're seeing there is this company says that it does expect organic sales growth of down 1% to up 1% with lower price mix as the company really looks to improve volume. And that's the need to happen for Wall Street right now. This is the company that's been seeing volume growth decline over the past few years, really with some hit or misses here and there in volume growth. But they're really leaning in to this idea that they can restore volume growth by fiscal 2026, essentially by year end. And also, too, I mean, they're investing in different ways. So forget the regular cereal. We now have Cinnamon Toast Crunch, which we've had obviously for a while, but also Cinnamon Cheerios as well. So, really just trying to say like, okay, where are consumers going to spend? Where are they seeing the most value? And what can we essentially provide? They also have those protein Cheerios out right now. So, it's all a matter of
03:07
Speaker A
Spinning everything.
03:08
Brooke De Palma
spinning everything, getting the consumers to splurge on items. That will help improve volume growth.
03:12
Speaker A
Let's talk about the last one. This has been a fun one to cover lately. Cracker Barrel. The restaurant chain set to report earnings for the first time since its logo backlash and the shares are very shorted apparently.
03:25
Brooke De Palma
Yeah.
03:26
Speaker A
going into this.
03:27
Brooke De Palma
If you take a look at Cracker Barrel, it's been so interesting to watch this dynamic. So over the past month, we are seeing shares down about 18% after they got that response to the logo backlash and then now they're restoring all the prior logo featuring Uncle Herschel back in the stores. They even posted a video yesterday on their social media account on their Instagram showing them actually physically putting back on the old uh the old logo. And so, there's a few questions going into this report. One, did they see an uptick because of this? Did it cause more consumers to be curious about what exactly the brand still is these days? that maybe it could have caused some foot traffic. Right now, Wall Street is projecting same-store sales growth of 3.49%. That's up from a decline of 10 uh rather 0.10% decline uh last quarter. Also, they've really been trying actually to turn around the brand despite all this backlash that they got with new menu innovations and also back of house optimization. John Tower pointing that out in a note. So, it'll be interesting to see right now, I think the focus is so much on just the response and what exactly they say about that backlash, but there's other things cooking in the back of the house as well.
04:29
Speaker A
Yeah, we'll see. I mean, listen, I hadn't thought about Cracker Barrel in a long time.
04:32
Brooke De Palma
But now you have been, right?
04:33
Speaker A
I've thought about it. Have I actually gone to eat in a Cracker Barrel? No. But maybe others have.
04:39
Brooke De Palma
Maybe others have.
04:40
Speaker A
Maybe, yes. If I'm on a road trip and I see a cracker barrel, will I stop in out of curiosity? Maybe. If I want some grits, if I want some cornbread, I think of it for those things. I don't even know if that's right. I guess I got to look at the menu. Thanks so much, Brooke.
