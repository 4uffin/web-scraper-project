Allie
Now, how active do you have to be as a stock picker? Because I don't know, I think of myself, my days are crazy. I like the fact that I am at least invested somewhere as a passive investor in the S&P.
00:13
Speaker B
And you work in finance, by the way.

Allie
And I work in finance, by the way. So I I can understand how a lot of folks out there might feel overwhelmed by the idea of stock picking and constantly having to manage their own portfolio. So how do you balance sort of passive versus active investing?
00:30
Speaker B
Great question and obviously felt by many, even professionals working in the realm of finance. I completely get that, Ally. I would say, first of all, you should be putting in the time that you want to put in because truly you can just buy index funds through a 401k and probably retire 40 years from now, if you just keep saving and investing all the way through, not trying to head fake your way out of the market or try to time the market in my opinion. So, I think that's okay. And yet, I think everyone in America should own one stock, at least one stock. It doesn't have to be a big part of your of your overall nest egg, but I I really feel it's important to to find companies that you like and become a part owner, which is what the stock market lets us do. And if you're doing what I'm doing, I'm buying a few times a year. I'm almost never selling, and it doesn't take me much time. In fact, I think one of the beauties of rule breaker investing is that we spend less time and do better

than those

I love that.

than the others. And it's an amazing like, my favorite tradeoffs are when there's no tradeoff. Less time, better performance.
