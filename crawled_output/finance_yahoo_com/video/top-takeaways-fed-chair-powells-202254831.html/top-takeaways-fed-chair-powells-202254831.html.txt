Top takeaways from Fed Chair Powell's post–rate cut presser
Yahoo Finance Video
and Josh Lipton
September 17, 2025
The Federal Reserve opted to cut interest rates by 25 basis points on Wednesday — the first rate cut of 2025. EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco and JPMorgan Asset Management global market strategist Meera Pandit join Market Domination with Josh Lipton to discuss Fed Chair Powell's post-decision press conference, highlighting their biggest takeaways from Powell's remarks. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination.
Video Transcript
00:00
Speaker A
We have E.Y.'s Greg Daco and J.P. Morgan Asset Management's Mira Pandit still with us. Thank you both for being here. Greg, I'll start with you. Uh, presser concludes. I know you were listening carefully. You were taking notes, Greg, student that you are. What what were your big takeaways?
00:23
Greg Daco
I think there were three takeaways uh and a slightly hawkish tilt uh to the overall press conference. Number one, uh Powell did confirm that this was a risk management rate cut. Number two, he did highlight that they were going to proceed on a meeting-by-meeting basis. There's no guarantee that there's going to be a rate cut at every single meeting going forward. And number three, he confirmed that essentially, the economy still warrants a moderately restrictive monetary policy stance. Those three elements are more hawkish than the uh rate cut and that the statement might have indicated. So the Fed is still on this gradual approach in terms of monitoring economic data, inflation data, and adjusting monetary policy as it sees fit depending on the economic outlook.
01:23
Speaker A
Were there any questions, Greg, I'm just curious, that weren't asked in that presser by those very good reporters that you wish you wish had been?
01:34
Greg Daco
No, I think one thing that I'll highlight, uh, that was I think very important is that Powell iterated twice that there's no risk-free path. Uh, essentially, we have a large dispersion of views when it comes to the dot plot with some actually expecting a rate hike before the end of the year and some expecting-- Mira and likely-- expecting 150 basis points of rate cuts. So we have a wide dispersion, and Fed Chair Powell highlighted that dispersion and mentioned the importance of looking at this from a probabilistic perspective. There are 10 policy makers that foresee three or more rate cuts, there are nine that foresee two or less. So there's a wide degree of dispersion, and it's a historically challenging economic environment to navigate monetary policy.
02:30
Speaker A
Mira, I want to get your thoughts as well as a strategist. You were listening. What what were your highlights, Mira, and what what do you make of the the market's response and reaction?
02:40
Mira Pandit
One of the things I would add to Greg's comments is when he was talking about the balance of risks, Chair Powell. He talked about how that balance of risks were skewed towards inflation and not that now they're skewed towards the labor market, but they're potentially approaching equilibrium. So his sentiment in that hawkish vein was that the inflation picture is still very much squarely on their minds. The labor market component has started to balance those risks out a little bit more, but we're not squarely balanced and they're certainly not all the way swinging towards being so worried about the labor market at this juncture yet. Now, I'd also say, again, they do have a very challenging situation ahead of them in that you could see growth slow the rest of this year, then start to pick up early next year and slow again. You could see inflation lift, stay high, and then start to peter out next year. And all the while, some of the things that might lift growth may not also make the labor market stronger. You know, if you have things like corporate tax provisions where people can spend more on CapEx, maybe they have a little bit more cash on hand. Perhaps that could prevent them from having to lay off as many people if that was the direction of travel, but it's not necessarily going to reinvigorate the labor market. So it's interesting to hear from them that while inflation may be the transitory bit and usually the labor market is not, that's not really reflected in how they've put out their summary of economic projections with inflation numbers going up, but also the unemployment rate going just a tick lower next year for their 2026 projection. I think that highlights the challenge of looking at these things in aggregate, trying to decide who the dots are, trying to decide how the chips really fall when you look at that summary of economic projections in these two distinct camps.
