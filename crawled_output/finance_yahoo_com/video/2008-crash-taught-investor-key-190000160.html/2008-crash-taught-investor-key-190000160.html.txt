The 2008 crash taught this investor these key lessons
Yahoo Finance Video
Wed, September 24, 2025 at 2:00 PM CDT
The high-profile trade wars launched this year by the US government have shocked observers worldwide, including among our Canadian neighbors to the north. Is our economic relationship with Canada permanently in tatters, or is there room for optimism? On this week's Living Not So Fabulously, John and David Auten-Schneider speak with Maddie Morris, trade commissioner for the Consulate General of Canada, to gain some critical perspective on how the US's new trade policies are being received across the border. As both a US citizen and the first trans trade commissioner in Canada's history, Maddie shares her unique insight into the social and economic dynamics playing out between these two key allies.
To hear an international perspective on tariffs, startups, and investing, check out this week's full episode of Living Not So Fabulously. For full episodes of Living Not So Fabulously, listen on your favorite podcast platform or watch on our website. Yahoo Finance's Living Not So Fabulously is produced by Dennis Golin.
Video Transcript

Speaker A
What was it like investing early on in life uh interacting with money and and maybe share some of your mistakes and wins? Cuz when we interact with money, we all have mistakes and wins.
00:15
Speaker B
I was going to say, uh I certainly have made many a mistake when it comes to money. Um, and uh, you know, I I actually feel uh privileged to have made those mistakes and privileged to have made those mistakes I think earlier on than a lot of folks would have. Um, you know, I had uh summer jobs in in high school and I saved up money and um, you know, my dad uh worked at a a small credit union in rural South Carolina. You know, as mentioned, I I am an American. Um, and uh um I got the first advice I ever got, you know, in high school was uh invest in what you know.
00:54
Speaker B
Um my dad worked at a credit union, so I said, well, I I know banks. Um and so uh, you know, this is uh early 2008, uh and uh I put uh multiple summers worth of uh
01:08
Speaker B
I put multiple summers worth of uh uh my savings uh into uh Wachovia, uh into uh Wells Fargo, into uh uh some other organizations, some companies that uh don't exist anymore. Um, and I think at the lowest point, I'd lost 85% of everything I'd saved up.
01:21
Speaker A
Oh, wow. Ouch.
01:24
Speaker B
I I was going to say uh if anyone's heard of 2008, I uh I I felt that. Um, but I feel like I'm very privileged to have learned that in the relative safety and comfort of being a high school. Um, having learned that lesson early, uh you know, having learned to uh really focus more on just a little quip uh that you read on an article or a friend tells you. Um, you know, I heard the research a researching the fundamentals of the companies that you invest in.
01:57
Speaker B
Uh, kind of important. I learned the importance of diversification, um, in terms of being able to bring my uh I guess my uh dollars back from non-existence. I learned about dollar cost averaging, about not panicking, about scraping together whatever you can find, uh whenever the value of a stock that is in an otherwise valuable company has been undervalued.
02:22
Speaker B
And uh um I definitely now keep cash on the reserve um in case another moment like that happens, which um maybe you have a lot of listeners that um, you know, maybe they started investing after 2009. um and they have been in a situation the last decade or so that um, you know, it is it has been an easy time to make money over the last decade. Um and we'll see what that looks like moving forward.
