Speaker A
You mentioned Intel CEO Lip Bu Tan there, Ben. Uh what does this, this tell us about um him as a CEO as an executive. It wasn't Ben too long ago Trump was was calling for his resignation.
00:13
Ben
Yeah, no, I think so such a turn of events, right? There was the everybody calling for his head. He's aligned with China and now, you know, he kind of came out and has has really done some deals with Trump. You know, in fact, I I was thinking about this too is as as great of a of a deal maker that everybody, you know, likes to promote Trump as, it looks like Lip Bu Tan is equally as good as a deal maker.
00:36
Ben
And and I think again, right, this comes back to his approach that he stated from the beginning, which is they want to be very customercentric. They want to be aligned with their customer interests. They want to be a provider of choice that delights those customers. Those are those are his words. And so I think him being able to go to someone like Jensen or any other partners and really say, whatever it takes, you know, we'll do it. We'll deliver. We'll put the hard work in to make sure we hit milestones and we deliver and and clearly, you know, Jensen believes him on that because he said, right, we've done our due diligence and we believe that Intel has a bright future. So, I think he I mean, and if anything, right, it's just signaling he's the right person for this job and he's able to get important deals done that are that are building a better foundation for Intel's future.
