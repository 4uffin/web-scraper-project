Speaker A
And finally, let's talk about President Trump's visit to the UK. He's been greeted with a lot of fanfare, not just from officials there, you know, royalty, etc., but from companies that are also uh inking partnerships there, Ramzan.

Ramzan
That's right. There's a lot of pageantry, but it's interesting to note that President Trump isn't in London, he's in Windsor. There have been protests as well. But he has been accompanied by uh quite a few of the, you know, leading names in technology, US leading names. Among them, uh Jensen Huang, from Nvidia's Jensen Huang and also Microsoft's Satya Nadela are all are with him as well. And what they've the two countries have agreed is a big, what they called a tech prosperity deal. And it's estimated to be worth around 42 billion dollars. And some of the investments that have been promised include Microsoft saying it'll spend around 30 billion dollars expanding cloud and AI infrastructure in the UK. Google's promised almost 7 billion dollars in spending on a new data center and AI research. Nvidia said it would deploy 120,000 advanced chips across the country. So, a lot of US investment uh in the UK, uh also Salesforce has said they're going to invest, Core Weave as well. So, that's good for the UK, but what about the US? Well, on the flip side, the British pharmaceutical firm GSK said it's going to invest 30 billion dollars in US research and development and supply chain infrastructure over the next five years. Now, remember, Pharma is a bit of a hot topic because of President Trump's threat to potentially somewhere down the line to hit hit uh the these drug companies with 200% tariffs. Well, a lot of companies are already making that move to invest in the UK to avoid that. So, that's quite an interesting take. Also an interesting thing on the tech front, the investment in um the UK could be quite significant because just across the water, across the channel, uh in Europe, there's a bit of a an uneasy relationship with US tech firms and these and uh the European regulators there. And President Trump has often criticized you the EU uh in terms of their how how they hit US tech firms. So maybe going to the UK is is one way of showing, well, actually, we don't need you, we can go to the UK and we can be as prosperous there. Uh also, the UK is desperate as well for this investment. GDP growth in the three months up to July was just 0.2% in the UK. So the economy not really firing on on all cylinders. So this investment will be uh very much welcome here in the UK.
