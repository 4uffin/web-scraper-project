What are H-1B visas? Trump's new $100k fee that could hit Big Tech
Yahoo Finance Video
Mon, Sep 22, 2025, 3:47 PM
President Trump is raising the fee for H-1B visa applications to $100,000. In the video above, Yahoo Finance Head of News Myles Udland explains what H1-B visas are, while Veda Partners managing partner and director of economic policy Henrietta Treyz explains why the new fee could pose a problem for trade relations with India. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination.
Video Transcript
00:00
Speaker A
The Trump administration looks set to revamp the H1B visa program, raising the application fee to $100,000 and potentially upending one of the country's signature immigration policies.
00:09
Speaker A
But what exactly is this program and who does it serve?
00:15
Speaker A
The H1B visa allows US employers to hire foreign professionals in so-called specialty occupations, jobs that require at least a bachelor's degree, often in fields like computer science, engineering, or medicine.
00:30
Speaker A
The idea is to fill labor shortages in areas where US workers may be scarce by bringing in other individuals with skills not otherwise available in the domestic workforce.
00:46
Speaker A
Now, workers cannot get this visa on their own. A US employer needs to petition on their behalf, registering electronically and paying the required fees.
00:58
Speaker A
And until now, the process typically cost employers just a few thousand dollars, but under the Trump administration's changes, the price tag for a new application is set to jump to $100,000.
01:09
Speaker A
Once registered, applications go through a selection process run by US citizenship and immigration services, and not everyone who applies will be granted an H1B visa.
01:21
Speaker A
For the fiscal 2026 cycle, there were over 350,000 total registrations, but only 120,000 were selected.
01:31
Speaker B
H1B visas are designed for what are designated as highly skilled workers from outside of the US to come in and work in the US. They're heavily used by the tech industry.
01:48
Speaker B
Joining me now to talk more about the effect of all this, Henrietta Trayes, Veda Partners' managing partner and director of economic policy.
01:57
Speaker B
So Henrietta, um it seems as though there was initially a lot of confusion when this was announced. Now there's a little bit more clarity. It's a one-time fee, for example, not an annual fee. But we've seen more of an effect stock-wise on Indian companies than on US tech giants.
02:12
Speaker B
What are you hearing about how this is being digested?
02:18
Henrietta Trayes
Yeah, there's a lot of moving parts here. As you suggested, there was a lot of confusion. Uh Secretary Lutnik came out and said that this was going to be an annual fee collected over six years,
02:27
Henrietta Trayes
which would have been a material ongoing sort of persistent negative for the what I think it's 71% of H1B users that come from India.
02:37
Henrietta Trayes
Uh the bulk of the remainder come from China, but the negative hit of six consecutive years of $100,000 a pop would have been materially detrimental to India and migration over here.
02:50
Henrietta Trayes
Um, I I think it's something like 83, 86,000 workers per year that receive this H1B visa.
02:57
Henrietta Trayes
So, it is a material negative for India and what the administration has made clear, which is why some of the tech companies are being a little bit protected today and not responding in the same way is that there were going to be licenses and exclusions and off ramps for what you might assume would be the tech sectors that are closest to the administration and the CEOs there that are closest to the White House.
03:17
Speaker B
And Henrietta, um as you mentioned, this also has implications for US relations with India. This ahead of um, UN week here in New York where global leaders gather. President Trump's scheduled to speak tomorrow. presumably we'll see some maybe handshakes between Trump and Modi, who knows?
03:32
Speaker B
Um but you know, what are you sort of looking for and zeroing in on there?
03:36
Henrietta Trayes
Yeah, the US India trade situation is not good. Um not only do we not have a deal with India, but the tariffs keep ratcheting up.
03:42
Henrietta Trayes
The latest is obviously this H1B visa situation, but prior to that we'd had the Russia secondary tariffs imposed by President Trump at unilateral authority through the International Economic Powers Act and basically saying, you guys are not negotiating with the United States the way that we want.
04:00
Henrietta Trayes
Uh we know that Ambassador Greer, the current USTR has been very focused on India, not just in the second Trump administration, but also in the first, originally stripping them of their GSP status.
04:12
Henrietta Trayes
And they have a lot of issues to work through. There are at least three phases of trade negotiations that they anticipated working on with India
04:22
Henrietta Trayes
and we're not even done with the first one yet and it's October. uh or mid almost October. So there's a long way to go.
