Markets are 'definitely' at risk of a melt-up, strategist says
Yahoo Finance Video
Thu, September 25, 2025 at 6:30 AM EDT
Cetera Financial Group chief investment officer Gene Goldman joins Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Allie Canal on Morning Brief to discuss the impact on Federal Reserve interest rate cuts on the markets and whether the market is at risk of a melt-up or bubble. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief.
Video Transcript
00:00
Speaker A
So if we don't get the number of rate cuts that markets expect, how do you anticipate that to play out across some of the sectors you were even mentioning that have benefited and and even if you look at small caps that's really rallied. Do you expect a reversal of that if the Fed maybe takes a pause on their easing cycle?
00:19
Jim
Yeah, I think I think if you're J. Powell right now, J. Powell, you know, I know he speaks today at noon, East Coast time, and he's got a lot to talk about. He's got to talk about inflation pressures. Yes, the labor market is slowing down, but the economy looks pretty good. There's a lot of inflation pressures. Uh there's also some difficulty, I think in my opinion, for the Fed to build consensus. So this is all taken together. We have this volatility likely to overhang the market.
00:46
Jim
You look at the Fed right now, you've got Hamig and Masam and of course Jay Powell all saying, we should pause a little bit and watch the data. But then you have Morand and Bowman this morning just a few minutes ago coming out and saying, we should cut rates aggressively. There's a lot of difficulty to build consensus. I think the markets are anticipating this and they're waiting on the sideline to say, how does this play out?
01:05
Jim
But regardless of what happens, volatility is going to pick up and that's where we see the pullback coming to play. But most importantly, we just don't see a big nasty bear market because historically, you need a recession for a bear market, and we've only had three bear markets without a recession, um 20, 2022, 87 and 1962. And we don't see a recession anytime soon.
01:23
Speaker A
So no bear market, but do you think we're at risk of a melt up in stocks right now?
01:30
Jim
Definitely, definitely, definitely. You know, that's part of the reason why we do expect some type of pullback because again, the PE ratio on forward earnings is around 23. The tech bubble was around 25. And if you're seeing, you know, the the Fed cutting rates while the economy is doing okay. Yes, I agree the labor market is slowing down.
01:46
Jim
Part of that is probably driven by AI. AI is taking some jobs away, but at the end of the day, GDP according to the Atlanta Fed at 3.4% for the third quarter. That's a great number. And the City Economic Surprise Index is improving every single day. All this in consideration, the economy is going okay.
02:02
Jim
I don't think we need more rate cuts. At that point, with that in consideration, we do risk a melt up where everyone jumps in and buys aggressively. We worry about this.
02:11
Speaker A
And Jim, we only have about 30 seconds, but what's the difference between a melt up versus a bubble? And are we even close to worrying about a bubble at this point?
02:20
Jim
That's a tough question at the end at the end of the session. Um, a melt up and a bubble. A melt up is more of a cautious move higher but still buying. A bubble is when things get really bad and burst.
02:30
Jim
We don't see a bubble bursting because again, there's a lot of cash on the sideline. There's a lot of people waiting on the sideline to jump in with that 26 trillion dollars of money market and savings on the sideline. So we don't see a bubble. We see a potential melt up which could push stocks down a little bit later.
