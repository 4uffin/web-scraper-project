Now, time for some of today's trending tickers. We are watching Lyft, Eli Lily, and Open Door.

First up, Lyft. It's partnering with Waymo for the first time to offer robotaxi services in Nashville starting next year.
00:20
Speaker A
The deal helps it better compete with rival Uber, which struck a multi-year deal in 2023 with Waymo to offer trips in Phoenix, Austin and Atlanta.
00:30
Speaker A
Alphabet owned Waymo has been conducting testing in Nashville since March. It will launch fully autonomous operations in the coming months.
00:38
Speaker A
The rides will open to the public next year, first through the Waymo app and then on Lyft's platform later in 2026.

Speaker A
Those shares right now surging 14%. They earlier jumped as much as 16%, the biggest gain in over 4 months.
00:53
Speaker A
Next up, Eli Lily. Patients on its experimental diabetes pill lost more weight and had better blood sugar control than those on an older approved rival from Novo Nordisk.
01:03
Speaker A
The late stage study comes as Eli Lily's pill inches closer to becoming another needle-free alternative in the blockbuster market for GLP-1s.
01:10

Lily and Nova Nordisk are vying for a greater share of the booming market, which some analysts say could be worth around 100 billion dollars by the 2030s. those shares up just a bit today.
01:21
Speaker A
And finally Open door. Shares are jumping. It's new CEO, who's just three days into the job, says they filed an 8K, so his and Open doors X accounts would be used to talk with investors.
01:29
Speaker A
An 8K filings report filed with the SEC by publicly traded companies to disclose significant unscheduled events that could affect their operations or financial conditions.
01:41
Speaker A
He added that the company has parted ways with this external PR agencies and wants their investors to hear directly from the company.
01:50
Speaker A
Investors clearly rewarding open door for that latest announcement. And this is by the way, a playbook that we have seen other so-called meme stocks or retail investor favorites take.
