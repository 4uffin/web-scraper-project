Now, time for some of today's trending tickers. We are watching Lyft, Eli Lily, and Open Door.

Speaker A
First up, Lyft. It's partnering with Waymo for the first time to offer robotaxi services in Nashville starting next year.
00:20
Speaker A
The deal helps it better compete with rival Uber, which struck a multi-year deal in 2023 with Waymo to offer trips in Phoenix, Austin and Atlanta.
00:30
Speaker A
Alphabet owned Waymo has been conducting testing in Nashville since March. It will launch fully autonomous operations in the coming months.
00:38
Speaker A
The rides will open to the public next year, first through the Waymo app and then on Lyft's platform later in 2026.

Speaker A
Those shares right now surging 14%. They earlier jumped as much as 16%, the biggest gain in over 4 months.
00:53
Speaker A
Next up, Eli Lily. Patients on its experimental diabetes pill lost more weight and had better blood sugar control than those on an older approved rival from Novo Nordisk.
01:03
Speaker A
The late stage study comes as Eli Lily's pill inches closer to becoming another needle-free alternative in the blockbuster market for GLP-1s.
01:10

Lily and Nova Nordisk are vying for a greater share of the booming market, which some analysts say could be worth around 100 billion dollars by the 2030s. those shares up just a bit today.
01:21
Speaker A
And finally Open door. Shares are jumping. It's new CEO, who's just three days into the job, says they filed an 8K, so his and Open doors X accounts would be used to talk with investors.
01:29
Speaker A
An 8K filings report filed with the SEC by publicly traded companies to disclose significant unscheduled events that could affect their operations or financial conditions.
01:41
Speaker A
He added that the company has parted ways with this external PR agencies and wants their investors to hear directly from the company.
01:50
Speaker A
Investors clearly rewarding open door for that latest announcement. And this is by the way, a playbook that we have seen other so-called meme stocks or retail investor favorites take.
