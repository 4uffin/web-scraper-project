AI or the Fed: Which is more important to the markets right now?
Yahoo Finance Video
and Josh Lipton
Thu, Sep 18, 2025, 8:00 AM
The Fed cut rates by 25 basis points at its September meeting on concerns that the labor market is slowing. However, equity markets have, so far, shrugged off worries about a slowing economy and instead focused on AI. So which matters most to the markets right now — AI or the Fed? Find out US Bank Asset Management Group chief investment officer Eric Freedman's answer in the video above. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination Overtime.
Video Transcript

Josh
Some have argued the Fed is important to the stock market, for sure. You got to pay attention.
00:04
Josh
AI is more important. You agree with that?
00:06
Eric
I do. I think that in the very
00:07
Josh
You do agree.
00:07
Eric
the very near term, I think the Fed is I I think, you know, over over time, uh, you know, AI will will likely take a backseat, but in the very, very here and now, I do think some of the studies we've seen, again, that Stanford piece that came out about challenges especially to newer entrance to the labor market, that's really being driven by AI. So, if you look at at the, you know, the the sort of confluence of factors right now, you've got a weakening labor market, but you also have this AI push, which is really impacting entry level positions, especially entry level positions that used to lead towards more white collar type of jobs. So, near term, I do think AI is is of utmost importance, but again, over time, the Fed is always uh always always has a very important hand.
00:42
Josh
Let me ask you, so your clients come to you, they say, listen, where should I be overweight in the US stock market?
00:47
Josh
What are you telling them?
00:48
Eric
Yeah, we still think that technology would be would be the most natural answer. I think that the CAPEX cycle continues again, not just this isn't like a a rerun of the the the the 2000 playbook of overinvestment in technology. These are free cash flow generating companies that are spitting off a lot of opportunities for again, re-entry into in into their capex budgets for uh for for tech spend. So I think that's that's still the place where we want to be.
01:07
Eric
An area Josh that we think it gets less attention that we find very interesting is global infrastructure. This has a combination of both inflation protection, it has some yield attached to it as well. You've got some, you know, transportation of goods and energy, but it's also is a very underloved, under appreciated sector. We also think again, picking up some utility exposure there, which is not a bad place to be. So global infrastructure, generally off people's radar screens, we think should be on people's radar screens.
01:26
Josh
What's your guidance for fixed income investors?
01:28
Eric
Yeah, we've still think that municipal bonds was the, you know, is the underloved uh asset class if you will. I think if you look at taxable equivalent yields, especially for our wealthier clients, you're talking about, you know, 7, 8, 9% taxable equivalents, especially if you look at municipal high yield, that's a spot that we really like. We also think that reinsurance also tends to be off people's radar screens. That's something that we think is very differentiated. Last thing would be structured credit. We still think that things like non-agency mortgage debt do offer some interesting yields. So we'd be a little less interested on government debt. We think that owning some yield that is again, not just tied to the business cycle, those are things that we like in in this environment.

Josh
Eric, always good to see a fellow Colgate alum in person.
01:55
Eric
Go Raiders.
01:56
Josh
Thank you, sir.
