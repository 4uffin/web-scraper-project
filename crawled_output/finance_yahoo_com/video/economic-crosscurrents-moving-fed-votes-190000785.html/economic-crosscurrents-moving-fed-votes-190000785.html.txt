Economic 'crosscurrents' are moving how Fed votes: Loretta Mester

Wed, Sep 17, 2025, 12:00 PM
US central bank officials cut interest rates for the first time in 2025 on Wednesday, voting to lower the range by 25 basis points at September's FOMC policy meeting. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is expected to deliver public remarks later this afternoon. Former Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland CEO and president Loretta Mester speaks to the Market Domination team about the economic "crosscurrents" that are influencing how Fed Board members are approaching rate policy and interpretting data. Mester is currently a senior scholar at Princeton University's Griswold Center for Economic Policy Studies and ad adjunct professor of Finance at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination.
Video Transcript
00:00
Speaker A
Joining us now for a closer look at the delicate balance of risks the Fed is facing. We have Loretta Mester, senior scholar at Princeton University and former president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland. Loretta, it's great to see you.
00:15
Speaker A
Um, we were just talking to Kathy Jones about the dispersion of dots, and we also know just because of sort of the drama in the days uh leading up to this Fed meeting, we know about the dispersion perhaps of personalities and views, uh, in inside the Fed chambers been sort of widening.
00:40
Speaker A
Um, how should investors be thinking about that and how they can reach consensus, you know, not today, they've reached it, but you know, for the the remainder of meetings this year.
00:54
Loretta Mester
Well, the first thing to point out is there's a reason for dispersion that's independent of the personalities in the room, and it really has to do with there's cross currents in the economy.
01:07
Loretta Mester
And some of the things that we're seeing are due to reactions of firms to higher tariffs that are either in place already or coming. Some of it has to do with the labor market and the fact that the supply of labor is moving as well as the demand of labor. So there's a good reason with so many cross currents on the economy that you'd expect to see policy makers doing their job and really perhaps coming with different data, different views of the data,
01:37
Loretta Mester
different reconnaissance from their districts and maybe having a different opinion about what is the best policy to get back to full employment, maximum employment and price stability. And so that's showing up here and that's not a problem because that's the type of dispersion and views that one might expect given the uncertainty about where the outlook is going. They did reach more or less consensus. There was only one dissent. I know some people were thinking that we might see more
02:11
Loretta Mester
this this time. So, you know, it's looks like they had a good discussion around the table about the economics, the outlook, and really this is a risk management um, process here, right? We know the downside risks to the employment part of the mandate have gone up with the data that shows that employment has weakened. We're not necessarily saying the employment
02:44
Loretta Mester
picture is bleak, um, because supply and demand are really still in balance, although, you know, it's like I call it an uneasy balance because demand could begin to to uh pull back more than so far, but the unemployment rate remains low. So, again, the inflation numbers, again, the the committee has said many members that they think they're going to look through that, um in terms of it's a one of, but others are more cautious and you can see that in their projections.
03:19
Loretta Mester
As I think someone on your panel before, you know, the dots really speak to the different narratives that could really explain this economy. Some are saying that we do have an inflation issue independently even of the tariffs, because services, core services, X, housing is not moving down on a path back to 2%. It seems to be quite sticky. And I think you see that in the dots with people reluctant to do more cutting.
03:52
Loretta Mester
And others are probably putting more weight on the the employment picture and looking at that picture and saying downside risks are starting to manifest themselves and so they should take out more insurance and therefore cut more. So, I don't see this as a, um,
04:12
Loretta Mester
a problem or a even anything that's really surprising that given the environment we're in, that you'd see this kind of dispersion. And the chair did a great job, I think in bringing the parties to the table and getting a consensus. And we'll hear more in the press conference about what that meeting, you know, how they determined where they went to and what kind of balance of risk they're looking at.
04:36
Speaker B
You know, Loretta, you mentioned personalities there and there's a lot going on there, Loretta, in terms of the personalities. You got a lot of drama with Lisa Cook and Stephen Myron and I'm just wondering, Loretta, how you're thinking through all that, if you were still at the Fed, how you would be navigating all that, Loretta, these personnel issues.
05:01
Loretta Mester
Look, I you know, I don't know Steve Myron, but I know the other people around that table and I can tell you that all that is left outside the room. When you go into the room, you're there to do your job, which is analyze the economy, bring your best judgment to bear, look at the models, hear what the staff says, hear what your colleagues around the table are seeing in their districts and how they're interpreting
05:32
Loretta Mester
the data and the economic uh developments that we've seen since the last meeting, and then coming up with a path forward into what's going to get us back to price stability and maximum employment. So all of that stuff may be, you know, thought about when you're out of that room. But once you're in that room, you have a job to do. And the people I know at the Fed take it very seriously. They're very dedicated to the mission of the Fed and hitting the congressionally mandated goals and that's what they do in that room.
