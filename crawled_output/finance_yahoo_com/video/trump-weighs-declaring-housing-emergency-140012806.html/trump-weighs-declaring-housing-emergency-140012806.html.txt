00:00
Speaker A
I see reports and I know you saw this too, Jim, that Trump is considered declaring this housing emergency. It doesn't look like we had a whole lot of details on it. I saw maybe standardized building and zoning codes, maybe trim closing costs, but you saw those headlines or reports. What did you make of that?
00:16
Speaker B
Yeah, I I think what I make of it is that housing continues to have its moment. Big part of the the uh the election last year, both candidates, uh President Trump has talked about housing. Uh to see that he's going to take some federal action, especially on those regulatory side of things where the where the uh the federal government really has a better role to play. Um but trying to cut those costs, whether it's regulatory, land use, codes in particular, adding tens of thousands of dollars to the cost of house. If we can trim those back, we can build a much more affordable product.
00:46
Speaker A
I'm sure you're all a talk in the White House. When they they come to you Jim, and they say, hey, what can we do about the housing market? What do you tell them?
00:52
Speaker B
Regulation, regulation, regulation. First, work on the federal regulations that impact land development and building constructions. Do away with some of the things we saw over the last four years, which is really trying to socially engineer housing in this country. and then, we see what they can do to put pressure on local governments to get out of the way. uh whether it's building more infrastructure, uh investing in land use decisions that actually build more housing, uh saying no to the Nimbys and saying yes to the Yimbys, the yes in my backyarders, and realizing that the real solution for housing affordability in the country is to build more supply.
01:15
Speaker A
What about other Trump policies? I know you hinted at that, but tariffs, deportations, what do you see and what are you hearing in terms of the impact of that?
01:22
Speaker B
We've definitely seen the tariff, the uncertainty in the tariff space uh increase costs. Uh you know, maybe the cost between 10 and 11% on the cost of a house if we talk to our members. But again, it's been spotty. This the tariffs come in, then they go away, uh then they come in again. Uh so it but we have seen producers raise their costs on the threat of tariffs, even though those tariffs may never be realized. Uh deportations, again, we've seen the labor supply tighten, but that's been that has been uh mitigated by the slowdown in building, so you don't see those pressures on the labor market as you would. Now, if we get going over the next few months or six months, I could see labor uh becoming an issue for us.
