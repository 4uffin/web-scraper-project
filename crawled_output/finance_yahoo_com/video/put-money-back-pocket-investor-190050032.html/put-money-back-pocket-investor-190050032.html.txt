Speaker A
When you are a W2 employee, the tax code rewards investors. Most of us think about investors as business owners. But when you are a W2 employee, if you were to go out and invest in real estate, invest in stock, invest in certain things, there's tax benefits for investing back in our economy. But even above and beyond that, what you always want to do, you always want to do what I call a tax checkup. Get with somebody that knows, make sure you're maximizing those deductions, right? Whether it's itemized deductions, writing off your home, um mortgage interest, or maybe you're using your home periodically for business or even allowing your employer to host meetings at your location or you're working from home, like there's ways to reduce your tax bill.
01:05
Speaker A
I think what's really important is that the average taxpayer gets out of their own way. I've been doing this for 30 plus years. I have a masters in taxation. I eat and sleep the tax code, and I'm always finding something new. I think we as individual taxpayers think we know, but we don't know. It is levels to this tax stuff out there, and it behooves you to get in the game with somebody that knows what they're talking about.
01:46
Speaker B
I love that. So, to your point, you're always learning something new. Clearly, it is living, breathing, is something changing every year. What are some of the big changes that went into place this year?
02:04
Speaker A
Oh, yes, absolutely. So this year, we had the one big beautiful bill act that came into play. and some of the things that changed as a result of that, they increased the amount that we can deduct for our property taxes with they're calling the SALT deduction. That came up from 10,000 to $40,000. They increased the child tax credit. They increased the bonus depreciation for those that want to buy the vehicles that are over 6,000 pounds. They increase the ability to accelerate the write off for people that are investing in real estate. Um they increased the threholds for our seniors to get a little bit of extra money there. There was something in that one big beautiful bill for everybody to take advantage of.
