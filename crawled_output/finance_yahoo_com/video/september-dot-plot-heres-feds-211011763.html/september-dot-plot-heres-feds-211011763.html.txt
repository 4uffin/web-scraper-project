September dot plot: Here's how the Fed's projections have changed
Yahoo Finance Video
Wed, Sep 17, 2025, 2:10 PM
The Federal Reserve released its latest "dot plot" at its September meeting. Released quarterly, it shows where Fed members expect interest rates to be in the coming months and years. Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Allie Canal breaks down the most recent dot plot and shows how it has changed from June. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination Overtime.
Video Transcript
00:00
Josh
The Fed cutting interest rates on Wednesday by 25 basis points. We also got a new summary of economic projections along with the decision, and Yahoo Finance senior reporter Allie Cannell joined us now to break down the details. Allie.
00:13
Allie
Yeah, Josh, that's right. In addition to the Fed's first rate cut of the year, the central bank is now signaling two more in 2025. That would take the benchmark rate down to a range of 3.5 to 3.75% by year end.
00:27
Allie
This comes from the Fed's so-called dot plot, which charts policymakers' projections. Now, the latest read was a bit more dovish than June. Nearly every official expects some sort of easing this year, with more penciling in three cuts, some have two, and one calling for as many as six. At the same time, the Fed upgraded its growth outlook but flagged a weakening labor market, suggesting policymakers are prioritizing jobs even as inflation remains sticky.
00:53
Allie
So let's break down a bit more. You're seeing on your screen there, some of the longer-term projections. and there was a lot of dispersion in this September dot plot. Like I mentioned, one policymaker anticipating six rate cuts by the end of this year. Just one thinks we will hold steady uh at where rates currently were. This is a change from what we saw in June. So, a more dovish Fed this time around.
01:28
Allie
And a lot of this has to do with the fact that we have inflation remaining sticky. We have weakening labor market dynamics and there was a lot of uh different differing opinions here from FOMC officials. Now, this is something that Jerome Powell was specifically asked about during that post-decision press conference. He said it's natural to see some dispersion, especially as we're operating in an unusual economic environment.
01:54
Allie
So let's talk about some of the other projections here. GDP, that was revised up from what we saw in June to 1.6%. By 2026, we are expected to reach 1.8% and then near closer to 2% in 2027. and then over the longer run, FOMC officials anticipate 1.8% for growth. So the economy is still growing. that's at least the expectation.
02:22
Allie
And then if we take a look at the unemployment rate, same with June, 4.5%. We're currently at 4.3%, so a slight uptick there. We are expected to hit 4.2% by 2028 and remain at that level over the long term. But inflation, that is expected to be a little bit more sticky in 2026 compared to those June projections.
02:44
Allie
So 3.1% expected this year, 2.6% in 2026, and then we will finally reach the Fed's 2% target all the way in 2028. So something to continue to watch especially as tariffs continue to work their way through the system. But all things considered, uh it was a very interesting post-decision press conference.
03:07
Allie
Many economists who we've been speaking with on the program today said that the conference was actually a little bit more hawkish than maybe the cut suggested. So all things to look out for here, Josh, as we continue to parse through a lot of this commentary and really analyze what the Fed ultimately decides to do through the rest of the year.
03:26
Josh
All right, thank you, Allie.
