Daniel Newman warns that agentic AI threatens both office jobs and gig work, from legal analysis to rideshare driving, simultaneously. On this week's episode of Trader Talk, Newman and host Kenny Polcari weigh the $30 trillion upside against the risk of paychecks disappearing before reforms catch up. Watch more episodes of Trader Talk here. Trader Talk with Kenny Polcari on Yahoo Finance delivers expert analysis and actionable insights, empowering you to navigate market volatility and secure your financial future. This post was written by Langston Sessoms.
Video Transcript
00:00
Speaker A
I've written a number of books on digital transformation.
00:01
Speaker B
Right.
00:01
Speaker A
And as we know, with each transformative era, and you've been through it because you watched the the the markets revolutionize, right? And I mean, think of how much trading now is algorithmic, right? There used to be
00:11
Speaker B
Yeah, yeah. You know, it used to be paper. Oh trust me, I was one of those guys.
00:13
Speaker A
Right, you were there.
00:14
Speaker B
Look, I'm a boomer, so I was one of those guys.
00:15
Speaker A
Hey Boomer. Um, but you know that this stuff is changing very, very quickly. Now, in every revolution of the past, it's been about more jobs, not less, right? And so you go through the industrial revolutions, you went through, you know, the printing press, you went through radio, television, social, mobile, all these things, more jobs were created.
00:29
Speaker A
But I'm more cautious this time. And the reason I'm more cautious, you kind of said this in the intro in introduction to this show, is these agents and this technology and how much it is capable of doing, I've never seen technology kind of more directly come after both white collar work and blue collar work at the same time so quickly.
00:41
Speaker B
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
00:45
Speaker B
Right. And I think that's the concern for a lot of people, right? Because they don't necessarily know, you know, it goes after blue collar work. That's kind of what it's always done. But now it's coming after white collar work. And so and across the spectrum. could be legal, could be analysis, could be so many things.
00:54
Speaker A
Yeah, but you think about like over the last five years, 10 years, the gig economy. This is a really interesting thing that I've been thinking a lot about. The gig economy created jobs delivering food, delivering people. Um, you know, Uber, it's been amazing. But now Tesla's building robo taxis.
01:06
Speaker B
Right.
01:07
Speaker A
And I'm in Austin. They're driving around my city right now, Waymo. This is great technology and by the way, more reliable than humans.
01:12
Speaker B
Yeah, but do you get in a Waymo?
01:13
Speaker A
Absolutely.
01:14
Speaker B
Do you?
01:14
Speaker A
Absolutely. Don't don't even think twice about it. Look, the waymo the waymo drives much better than the average Uber driver. It's it's it's a data driven fact. I'm a data driven guy.
01:21
Speaker B
Right.
01:22
Speaker A
But the bottom line is is like, do you care if doordash would be delivered to you by a drone, or by a, by a Optimus robot, or by
01:28
Speaker B
No. No.
01:29
Speaker A
Right, we don't. But the thing is, think how many people created a gig during the gig economy. Now, either they couldn't make enough money in their first job and they now are driving Uber. What happens now when all that gets replaced? That's just one example though of potential replacement, disruption, displacement.
01:41
Speaker B
Disruption.
01:43
Speaker A
So, what we see overall is that it's time is the biggest issue here. Because what I do believe fundamentally, as a as a techno optimist, what I do fundamentally believe is that the revolution of AI will create a boom. We think $30 trillion dollars of economic growth, Kenny.
01:51
Speaker B
Right. Yeah, yeah.
01:52
Speaker A
But historically the transformations have been over years, maybe five years, 10 years. This is happening so quickly.
01:56
Speaker B
Right. Yeah.
