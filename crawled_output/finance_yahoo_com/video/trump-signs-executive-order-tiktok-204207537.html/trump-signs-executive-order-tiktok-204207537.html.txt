News Anchor
We go now live to the White House where President Trump is signing an executive order clearing the way for a deal to sell TikTok's US assets to some US investors.
00:11
Speaker A
decisions based on what's good for their business as opposed to what's good for another government's propaganda arms. So, that's what we've done with this deal. I think it's very good for the American people. and as the president said, young people love this. We actually want everybody to access this, uh whether they're they're maggot or not. We just want it to be fair. We want it to be fair to everybody, and we think that's what's going to happen with this new uh arrangement.
00:35
Speaker C
Will the US government
00:36
Speaker B
And and and just just to follow up on the Vice President. There there were two pieces to the transaction. The Vice President's office has worked since the spring for the commercial transaction between the investor groups. And then uh Treasury and a group including the Vice President's office were in Madrid two weeks ago to negotiate with the Chinese. and it was a result of President Trump's close relationship with party chair Xi that we were able to get this across the line. We created a framework uh for party chair Xi to agree. uh and then on the leader's call, uh the uh Xi and President Trump uh discussed the final arrangement. So it was it was one, two and that was the final piece.
01:17
Speaker C
Will the will the US government get any kind of annual payment as a result of this deal?
01:21
Donald Trump
Taxes. It's going to make money and we're going to get a lot of money in taxes and uh and you know, China wanted to see this go. This is a great legacy for China too and uh I thought President Xi was uh great in terms of his approval. We probably could have done it a different way, but it wouldn't have been the same. Wouldn't have been the same security at all, but I appreciated that he approved it. It was
01:48
Speaker C
So so aside from taxes, there's no there's no part of a deal that is like a a payment to the US government?
01:56
Donald Trump
Well, we're going to be announcing different things, but the US comes out great. And I think China comes out great because they're going to have a a very important legacy. and they have many other deals, you know, they have deals with us and they have deals in here in this country. And, you know, they want to be treated fairly also.
02:16
Speaker C
So Mr. President and Mr. Vice President, the the US company could change the algorithm to to push different content? Is that
02:22
Speaker A
The US company will have control over how the algorithm pushes content to users. And that was a very important part of it. We thought it was necessary for the national security element of the law. We also just think it's important to protect American users. Again, we want users to use this platform the way they want to. We want the the business to make decisions about content based on the interest of the business and based on the interest of the users. and that's what we think will happen with this new arrangement.
02:42
Donald Trump
And they're paying a lot of money and I think uh hopefully it's going to be a great deal. They're very sophisticated people. You'll see a list. Have you seen a list yet of the people? Well, you've been reading about them. It's it's I know Michael Dell's involved and Rupert Murdoch's involved and a lot of and uh let's see. we have probably four or five absolutely world class investors that uh love the country and they made a lot of money with the country and uh many of them are in a somewhat related business. So it works out pretty well. and they're going to be very careful about all of these questions that you've been asking.
