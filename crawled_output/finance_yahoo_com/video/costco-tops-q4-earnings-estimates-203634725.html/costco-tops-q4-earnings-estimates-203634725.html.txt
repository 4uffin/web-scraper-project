and Josh Lipton
Thu, September 25, 2025 at 4:36 PM EDT
In this video:
COST
WMT
Costco Wholesale (COST) exceeded fourth quarter earnings estimates, reporting revenue of $86.16 billion (vs. estimates of $86.03 billion) and adjusted earnings of $5.87 per share (vs. estimates of $5.82). Yahoo Finance senior reporter Brooke DiPalma joins Josh Lipton on Market Domination Overtime in assessing Costco's quarterly results, the retailer's North American sales figures, and how the chain competes with Walmart (WMT). To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination Overtime.
Video Transcript
00:00
Josh
Costco is out with its fourth quarter results and Yahoo Finance is Brooke De Palma joins us now with a breakdown of those numbers, Brooke.
00:07
Brooke DiPalma
Yeah, Costco results largely came in line with what Wall Street had been expecting here. That's mostly why you see this flat reaction from investors this afternoon as this is what they had expected going into this report. They had hoped for same store sales growth of about 6.2%. We got 6.4% and both revenue and uh adjusted earnings both beat ever so slightly.
00:27
Brooke DiPalma
So if you take a closer look at where we ended up there, revenue for the fourth quarter did come in at 86.16 billion. That was largely just ever so slightly than what the street had expected of 86.03 billion. Adjusted earnings came in at $5.87. That's $5 higher than what the street had expected.
00:47
Brooke DiPalma
And if you take a look at beneath the hood of those same store sales growth numbers, like I said, grew 6.4%. Wall Street had to been expecting 6.2%.
00:54
Brooke DiPalma
We did see most of that strength actually come from their Canada segment. In Canada, those same store sales grew 8. 6 or rather 6.3% over in Canada. Other international rose about 8.6% and here in the US, they did see sales increase about 5% and 6% 6% on an adjusted basis.
01:14
Brooke DiPalma
And so largely this goes to show that we're continued to see this momentum for consumers to turn to Costco in this environment where consumers are very value conscious. They want the best bang for their buck and they're clearly willing to pay the membership for it.
01:29
Brooke DiPalma
We do know that they raised their membership price over this past year and right now consumers are really picky and choosy about where exactly they want to spend and Costco clearly benefiting here.
01:39
Josh
Being the retail pro that you are, Brooke De Palma, how would you compare and contrast this report, these results with what Walmart had to tell us?
01:52
Brooke DiPalma
Well, keep in mind, Walmart, of course has the Walmart US and Walmart International, but they also have that Walmart Sam's Club. And what we saw from Sam's Club, we did see growth of 5.9% there. So largely similar to what we saw here at Costco.
02:07
Brooke DiPalma
Every other retailer is not posting 6% same or sales growth. So clearly there's a trend here of these wholesale retailers gaining the momentum.
02:14
Brooke DiPalma
What I will say that on the flip side is that Walmart in addition to their Sam's Club wholesale business, they have a huge back end of convenience, delivery, really winning over consumers right now. And we have seen a huge difference within the year-to-date stock performance for Walmart and Costco.
02:30
Brooke DiPalma
If you take a closer look at that, what we've seen over this past year is Walmart's stock surged about 14%. And as you can see on your screen right now, Costco year to date is up only about 3%. And years ago, this was Yahoo Finance's company of the year. They had major tremendous growth post pandemic as consumers sought out that value when inflation peaked in 2022.
02:53
Brooke DiPalma
Now we're seeing similar momentum, but there is, you know, still large excitement on the street. There is 24 buys, 16 holds and one sell for Costco, but not really seeing that same return that we see Walmart seeing in this environment.
03:07
Josh
What are you listening to on the call?
03:09
Brooke DiPalma
Well, tariffs certainly will be top of mind. We do know that Costco has about one third of its US sales imported. Of course, especially heading into the holiday, we want to hear more about how they're planning out inventory, making sure they have their stock shelved and also Chinese imports make up about 8% of US sales for Costco. So certainly tariffs are still top top of mind, especially moving into the holiday.
03:27
Brooke DiPalma
And also Josh, I'm listening out to hear more about gold bars, maybe. Last year we saw e-commerce really surge because they were selling those gold bars. And I wrote a story this time last year about where exactly gold was and the implications it could have for Costco because gold bars were so hot. And last year at this exact time when I wrote that story, gold futures were at 2700. And now if you take a look at gold futures, they're up at 3780.
03:57
Brooke DiPalma
And so clearly there's this momentum. So did they also contribute to e-commerce sales for Costco this quarter? I'll be listening for that.
04:02
Josh
Thank you, Brooke, appreciate it.
