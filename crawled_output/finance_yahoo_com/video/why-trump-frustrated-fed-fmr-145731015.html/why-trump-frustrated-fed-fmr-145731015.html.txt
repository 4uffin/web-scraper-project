Video Transcript
00:00
Speaker A
Deutsche Bank is staying bullish on gold despite an almost 40% surge this year. Uh strategist Michael Shue released a $4,000 per target uh for the price of gold in 2026 this this morning. says Shu, quote, we believe that the FX and rates environment remain conducive to further upside for gold while positioning indicators are not stretched. Although gold has screened as rich versus fair value, we think much of this is due to the strength of official demand, which we expect to persist.
00:41
Speaker A
Okay, the Fed's decision on interest rates today comes at an interesting time for the US economy. On one hand, labor market data has been underwhelming. JP Morgan CO Jamie Diamond said this month the economy is weakening. On the more upbeat side of the equation, tech companies are piling billions of dollars into the economy to build out AI infrastructure and the Trump administration has losen loosened up regulations, especially in crypto to unleash more economic prosperity. This has the stock market continuing to touch fresh record highs. So my question
01:09
Speaker A
of the day is this. Being as clear eyed as possible, what is the real state of the US economy right now? Thomas Philipson is the former head of the Council of Economic Advisors, initially appointed to the CEA in 2017 by President Trump. Uh Thomas, really nice to see you here this morning. Thanks for hopping on. I'll put that question to you. Given all the variables you study in the economy, how do you see the the strength or lack thereof of the economy at this point?
01:40
Tomas Philipson
Yeah, I want to look sort of differentiate between backward and forward looking indicators. So backward, we're obviously slowing down in the labor market. Forward, uh like you mentioned, Cap X, which is a forward-looking uh uh indicator, obviously, people are investing for the future, has boomed quite a bit. Also, uh, you know, markets are on fire, which is forward-looking as well. So, if you look at GDP, the labor market is slowing, but GDP obviously came in at 3.3 last quarter.
02:13
Tomas Philipson
Atlanta GDP now or where Atlanta Fed is basically predicting a three of plus GDP for the next quarter. So, you it's it's kind of a productivity boom that's going on, slowing in labor markets increased in GDP that could be related potentially already to AI raising productivity. But that's certainly good news for wages because wages are linked obviously to higher productivity.
02:44
Tomas Philipson
And we see that in the retail numbers that just came out this week, I think, where the upper end of the distribution income distribution, 10% are spending half of retail in terms of the growth. So, I think that there's a contrast between labor markets and GDP that's really being a productivity story emerging. That's kind of interesting and I think sooner or later it's going to be some kind of connection with all the AI investments that's taken place.
03:19
Speaker A
Thomas, I'm glad you brought up the stock market because so many economists won't necessarily touch that rail of stocks, but since you did, you know, markets are often said to price things in on the economy what, six months in advance, then how do you think the first half of 2026 looks like for this economy? Do we get a labor market back in reacceleration mode for example?
03:42
Tomas Philipson
Yeah, I think so because there was a lot of churn with uncertain Trump, you know, he tried to reset our trading relationship with with foreign countries. By definition, if you reset that trading relationship, people don't know what the reset is going to look like. People now have a lot more clarity on that, so the uncertainty that hammered the market uh is sort of gone now and you have the uh the big beautiful bill coming in with a lot of growth-enhancing uh stimulus in there. So certainly the future
04:15
Tomas Philipson
of 2025 and early 26 looks a lot more optimistic in my view than the first half of 2025, which basically was a reset or it was a lot of churn due to the uncertainty of this reset.
04:32
Speaker A
This uh, of course is Fed decision day, Thomas. Uh we just had Senator Elizabeth Warren on and she was talking the Fed. I want you to check out this clip and uh love to get your reaction on the other side.
04:49
Senator Elizabeth Warren
I think there's something important to underline here and that is the chairman of the Federal Reserve said last month that the Fed would have lowered interest rates last February if only Donald Trump had not created so much economic chaos.
05:20
Speaker A
My question for you Thomas is, is Jerome Powell and the Fed, in fact, too late to prevent a sharper economic slowdown in the near term, even if they do come out here, uh cut rates by 25 basis points and signal two more rate cuts are are in the are in the cards for this year.
05:43
Tomas Philipson
I don't think we have a slowdown coming up, like I said, for all the reasons I mentioned. And I think the Fed is very, very confused on tariffs, which I which I don't fully understand. Uh tariffs are not inflationary. Uh fiscal and monetary policy is, so the Fed was partly responsible for the 9% inflation we saw in 22, uh because of the easing of the money supply. But tariffs are taxes on companies and they're not inflationary. They might be passed on somewhat to consumers, but
06:21
Tomas Philipson
it people can't spend more on any everything. Inflation has to do with economy-wide price increases, not industry specific price increases, which is what tariffs might generate essentially. And also the magnitude, if the tariff revenue is a two or 300 billion dollars. That's tiny relative to two-thirds of the economy, 20 trillion or whatever, that is consumption.
06:51
Tomas Philipson
So it's 1% of consumption we're talking about. Not all of which gets passed on to consumers. the the the producers eat some of that, whether it's foreign or domestic. So not all of that two or 300 billion gets pushed on to higher prices as consumers. So even if there was some price increases from tariffs, it's tiny relative to overall consumption, which is what CPI is measuring. It's overall consumption prices.
07:18
Tomas Philipson
So the magnitudes are off. So I think the Fed has been very non-transparent on why they think this is an issue and that's part of the reason why I think the White House is very, very frustrated with the Fed. They come up with these decisions and they have no way of communicating why they're coming up with them.
07:38
Speaker A
Why do you think they have been confused?
07:42
Tomas Philipson
I don't know. I mean, I think it's I mean the press, the business press is surely is equally confused. I mean it's like a tariff hysteria in terms of of of uh inflation, even though we have rising tariffs in 2025 so far, but in decreasing inflation since 2025 uh over 2025, a little bit of optic lately, but if you look at 25 alone, inflation is coming down, tariffs is going up. I think it's been uh politically driven.
08:14
Tomas Philipson
Uh if Biden had done this, it wouldn't be so much talk about tariffs.
08:21
Speaker A
Lastly, what's your uh best hope for the next Fed chair, Thomas, what would make an ideal candidate to replace J Powell?
08:32
Tomas Philipson
I think in an ideal my my favorite is Kevin Hasset for sure because I think he would be the best translator between what the Fed research does and the decisions they make. Again, coming back to the transparency essentially. I think he would be ideal in in in making the Fed more transparent. He would understand the economic research better than anyone and he would also be he's also a very good communicator with the press as as you see him on TV pretty much every day essentially.
09:02
Tomas Philipson
So I think he would be the ideal in my view.
09:07
Speaker A
Yeah, we've always enjoyed our chats with Kevin, very, very knowledgeable on all things economy to say the very least. Thomas Philipson, also very knowledgeable in the economy. Thanks for hopping on this morning. We appreciate it.
