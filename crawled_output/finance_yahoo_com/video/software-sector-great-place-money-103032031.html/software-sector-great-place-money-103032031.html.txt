Video Transcript
00:03
Julie
It's time now for our Investor Playbook, looking at software stocks. Joining me now is Steve Koenig, Macquarie US head of software and Services Research. Um Steve, it has been an interesting year in software land to say the least. With AI coming in more strongly, there have been a lot of questions about which companies could benefit, which might be eaten by AI. Um and then in the background all of that is bubble talk as well. And that was the subject of a recent note you put out.
00:36
Steve Koenig
Yes. Yeah, yeah.
00:37
Julie
Are we in a bubble there? What do you think?
00:39
Steve Koenig
Yeah. Well, good good pointed question, Julie. And I think, um, some of the indicators that we look at that uh point to like risk on, risk off, or investor preferences for growth over margin are um at like 24-month high levels in terms of um that preference for growth and risk on. So, um, that said, you know, I think it's it's we want to be, you know, maybe exercise a little bit more prudence at these valuation levels.
01:07
Steve Koenig
Um, but there's a lot of great revenue momentum going on in software now and certainly a lot of um investment dollars are flowing into anything AI related. So, you know, that's kind of the backdrop and I think it's investors want to stay prudent and uh stock selection remains very important. Um, uh but but I think that software is a great place to make money and um averaging in over time is probably a great way to go.
01:28
Julie
Um agentic AI seems to be the buzzword of the moment.
01:31
Julie
Is that where investors should be putting their dollars? And where are we in that? Or is all agentic AI created equal?
01:38
Steve Koenig
Yeah. Yeah. Well, great questions. Um, you know what's interesting is we we did a report on AI disruptors in software and if you look at the the top 60 private companies, um, software companies, they're all AI native. They're all focused on AI. The large majority of that is is large language models, it's platforms, it's tooling,
02:00
Steve Koenig
not not so much agentic AI. However, if you look at what public large SAS companies are doing, the large majority of their product efforts are around agentic. So there there's a little bit of a dichotomy here. And I I think what's happening is the public companies, they are looking to uh protect their application moats if you will. They're looking over their shoulder, they don't want disruptors to come in. and there are certainly there are companies on this uh private list that are that are focused on agentic AI.
02:27
Julie
Is it going to work? You know, the that attempt to protect their moat?
02:30
Steve Koenig
Yeah. Yeah. Well, I think to the extent, I I think the the big question right now is how fast is agentic AI going to get adopted? I think in the near term, most of the adoption is going to be driven by the public SAS companies that are putting this stuff out there for their customer base. Um but this stuff is taking time. And that's what investors are realizing as this year has progressed is like, um you know, there was a lot of hype around agentic AI and and the technology is promising but there's a lot of hurdles. Customers have to get their data in order. Customers need to make sure that these autonomous agents are operating accurately and and not hallucinating.
03:00
Steve Koenig
And so all of this is taking probably more time than investors initially thought. I think to the extent that agentic AI gets adop- adopted and I think that will happen, I do think the large public companies at least for the next several years have the advantage here.
03:14
Julie
Um so let's talk about some of your peak, uh some of your picks. And it's interesting when you talk about moat because Autodesk stands out to me on that point. We actually just spoke to the CEO of the company recently when they had introduced um some new products. Uh design software company for architects and people doing projects and things like that.
03:31
Julie
Is that why they're on your list?
03:34
Steve Koenig
That is one of the one of the tenants of our investment thesis. Uh I think the opportunities for them in applying generative AI to the design process are really um very unique um and and something different than most of the large SAS companies deal with structured data. Whereas with design, you've you've got multimodal inputs and the idea of having a a product designer or an engineer or an architect use text prompts to define the idea and then to use a multi-modal model to flush out that idea in terms of the building or the product. It's it's really a unique opportunity for them uh to apply AI. So we do like that.
04:14
Steve Koenig
But beyond that, I think our investment thesis with Autodesk has to do with the fact that we think there's lots of room for margin expansion for them. Their move into downstream construction into uh software for field operations is going very well. Um and I and I think that, you know, they are they're going to be more focused than ever on um on getting uh relationships established directly with end customers as they're changing their transaction model to sell directly to the end customer rather than through resellers. And that creates cross-selling opportunities and opportunities to run sales and marketing much more efficiently.
04:47
Julie
And I would imagine to capture more of the of the revenue as well. Datadog on your list as well. Tell me about that one.
04:51
Steve Koenig
Yes. Yes.
04:52
Julie
You know all my top picks, don't you? I think you've done your homework.
04:54
Steve Koenig
I do. Well I have been. I've been, yeah, I've read the note.
04:56
Julie
That's great. That's great.
04:57
Steve Koenig
So we like Datadog. Um, you know, really it it has to do with their um market position and share gains in DevOps and in particular, it's it's called observability is their category. And and it's really about um helping uh software developers and tech operations when they're putting into place new applications, assuring that those applications perform properly. And so Datadog kind of created this market for the cloud. You know, there were kind of legacy on premise vendors, but Datadog pioneered a unified platform for cloud observability. And and they've been gaining share in that market. And that market grows very much in tandem with hyperscaler revenue, which has has really had been decelerating, but really has stabilized around 15% growth.
05:46
Steve Koenig
And then you add to that Datadog share gains. They have a great revenue growth opportunity.
05:51
Julie
Um what I think is interesting of your top three picks and Atlassian is the other one, um team is the is the ticker. I believe HubSpot was on your list of top top like a month or two ago.
05:59
Steve Koenig
Yeah. Yeah.
06:00
Julie
Is that not are you still Do you still like that one or is it just that you like Datadog and better?
06:05
Steve Koenig
Yeah. Yeah. Um, you know, uh no big message there that you know, HubSpot was not on the list of top three. It's like we, you know, we try to look at what's timely at the moment. Um, you know, and I I think that HubSpot has some nice drivers. I think they're their paid seat expansions have been under pressure, but I think that that's starting to improve. And then I I think that they're actually handling their agentic AI strategy well, and I think that will be well received by customers over time. So, so we still like HubSpot, but in terms of some of the like near-term drivers, um we we like team and and Datadog and Autodesk as the three that we want to focus on right now.
06:42
Julie
Gotcha. Steve, great to see you in person. Thanks for coming in. Appreciate it.
06:45
Steve Koenig
Thanks, Julie. Likewise.
