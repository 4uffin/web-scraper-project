Nvidia-OpenAI: What Wall Street thinks about the $100B AI deal
Yahoo Finance Video
Tue, September 23, 2025 at 7:54 AM MDT
In this video:
OPAI.PVT

HOOD
Semiconductor giant Nvidia (NVDA) will be investing $100 billion in OpenAI (OPAI.PVT). This news comes just after Nvidia announced a $5 billion stake in Intel (INTC) alongside a new data center partnership. Robinhood Chief Investment Officer Stephanie Guild and Yahoo Finance senior reporter Brooke DiPalma gauge Wall Street's reaction to these Nvidia headlines and what it means for the chipmaker's valuation as it contributes to building out artificial intelligence infrastructure. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Opening Bid.
Video Transcript
00:00
Speaker A
Nvidia is the straw that stirs the drink. As long as they could come out of here positive news and the market took the Open AI news as a positive, you have to think a a bid is going to stay under stocks.
00:13
Brooke
Yeah, I what we're hearing this morning is a bit mixed reaction from the screen on what exactly this means for Nvidia, where exactly you can go from here, but largely the expectation that they will eventually match this valuation that investors have given Nvidia. We are seeing a video under a bit of pressure and that's largely because of that mixed reaction of what this means for the company. But then again, we're hearing from analysts like Dan Ives about the expectations that this company has, the roadmap that they're laying out about how exactly they remain to be the leader in the AI arms race. You know, once again, he he uh analyst calling this open AI deal additive to Nvidia of what Nvidia was expecting before. And so largely this isn't even baked into the next quarterly results. Of course, this deal happening just announced on Monday.
00:52
Brooke
And so really right now, analysts are saying on the street that this the expectations that Wall Street have right now aren't even in line with what it could be and the demand that they could see based upon this deal. And even Jensen Wong calling this the largest AI infrastructure project in history. And and this 100 billion dollar deal from what I'm reading, if if this is 10 gigawatts of AI power, well, it's something like 8 million homes that this could provide infrastructure around AI for.
01:21
Brooke
And so largely, there are there are certain strings and certain threads about what exactly this could mean. and so it's really setting expectations right. A- and ultimately there could be some risk though on other analysts are saying.
01:34
Speaker A
Yeah, but Brooke, the risk here is that my electric bill goes up and so does everybody else's because of this AI movement. Stephanie, let me get over to you and stay on a video. Uh DA Davidson, really important point here saying uh this morning they're concerned that Nvidia uh is underwrite is the investor of last resort. Look what they've done. Uh pouring billions of dollars into Open AI, they're losing money. Uh billions of dollars into Coreweave, they're losing money. Intel, uh they are now a major investor in Intel, they're not doing so great. How concerned are you that Nvidia is too important to the broader market?
02:01
Stephanie
I mean, uh and it certainly is. I mean, there's been a lot of memes out there about pictures of like Nvidia sticks holding up buildings that are about to fall down, but I don't actually think that's truly true. I think AI is is a real thing. Um this particular deal, I can see why there's some skepticism about it because it feels like a last few deals have been, let me give you money to for you to give it back to me and buy my stuff.
02:22
Speaker A
That's such a good point.
02:23
Stephanie
That's such a You're on the mark. You're on the mark.
02:26
Speaker A
Right, right.
02:28
Stephanie
That's kind of what it feels like. And so I think that's why it's like, what does this really mean? I don't know if it means that then like there's a little less supply for the people who want to buy it with their own money. um and then that creates kind of natural demand and inflation and the cost of what they can sell. So that's maybe a a bullish point. Um but, you know, without AI, I still think there's a lot of growth in this country and and you're starting to see it in other sectors. I mean, maybe this is tech related as well, but in aerospace and defense, for example. So I I you know, I I definitely think it's it's something you have to pay attention to. You have to kind of be invested in whether it's Nvidia or in other kind of smaller players that benefit. Um, you know, but but this deal is it's just it it's ripe for skepticism.
03:07
Speaker A
Um you need to you need to send me on X uh those memes because I I think that is just so on the mark.
