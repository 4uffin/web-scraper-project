As recent college graduates are struggling to find work, JLL Americas CEO of leasing advisory, John Gates, highlights five cities that are top talent hubs and five that are rising hiring hubs. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Asking for a Trend.
Video Transcript
00:01
Josh
The job market is especially tough for recent college graduates right now, but a new study is showing the cities where hiring is happening.
00:09
Josh
JLL's latest Talent hubs report finds graduates are getting jobs in big cities like New York and San Francisco while Sunbelt cities like Dallas are climbing in the rankings.
00:22
Josh
Joining us now for more, we have John Gates, JLL Americas CEO, CEO of leasing and advisory. John, it's good to see you. So, uh, the report here, we're looking at cities attracting those, those new graduates.
00:32
Josh
Before we get to the actual cities, and I want to run those by you, John. What what are the big drivers here uh, that you saw for for talent hub growth?
00:43
John Gates
And first of all, thank you very much for having me, Josh. Glad to glad to be here. The, um, big drivers, we've seen a meaningful uptick in venture cap investments and spending.
00:50
John Gates
And you have a couple big hubs, Northern California, obviously, and then New York has become a very large hub for that.
00:57
John Gates
And so you see uh sort of small cap and midcap tech job growth, which has been big. The financials have been hiring.
01:04
John Gates
And so we've just seen a an improved environment overall for college graduates, although very recently it's it's slowed a little bit.
01:10
Josh
Let's get into some of these cities, John. Let's see who makes the list. So it looks like your report shows uh San Francisco jumping back, it looks like John, to the number two talent hub.
01:21
Josh
Uh, what is driving that, John? and is it sustainable?
01:24
John Gates
Well, I I think it probably is sustainable for some period of time, although tech certainly is volatile. that is
01:31
John Gates
AI growth, the venture caps are funding a lot of new startups. Um, you're seeing, you know, B and C rounds and just so there's job growth there and exciting activity.
01:40
John Gates
and I think that's an exciting space for young people as well, getting out of college. and obviously you've got a lot of universities on the West Coast. Um, the the other thing I would throw in is it's uh young people get getting out of school have wanted to go to large cities to start their careers for a long time.
01:54
John Gates
They now have an opportunity to because there are jobs available.
01:57
Josh
Here's another one I want you to take on, John. Dallas, Fort Worth. It looks like it, John, it's been the top corporate relocation destination for five years running.
02:04
Josh
What explains that trend?
02:06
John Gates
You know, Texas is a is a pro business state. It's um, um, it's a reasonable cost of living state, it's a low tax environment state.
02:15
John Gates
And so yes, we've seen many corporate relocations, small, midcap businesses and Fortune 500 companies have moved here.
02:22
John Gates
And then beyond the headquarters relocations, you've I'm certain for sure you've seen the Y'all Street phenomena if you will, where large financials have been moving very large numbers of jobs here as well, although probably not headquarters.
02:33
John Gates
So we have been the beneficiary, I live and work out of Dallas. We've been the beneficiary of tremendous high-quality job growth here, and I think it's for typical, you know, business fundamentals, high-quality labor here as well.
02:43
Josh
What what has it meant for real estate demand in that area, John, specifically?
02:47
John Gates
It's it's been very good in the office market. It at the top end of the market, all these jobs and companies that are coming here, generally want newer office stock that's very well located.
02:56
John Gates
and as as you would know Josh, very highly amenitized. So lots of things to do to make the the building seem intriguing and exciting, uh street level activity and plenty of places you could walk to.
03:07
John Gates
And same things we're seeing in other big big cities as well. Dallas again throws in the uh, you know, quality labor at a reasonable price point, quality housing, quality education, low taxation, low regulation.
03:18
Josh
Any any kind of, let's say relatively affordable markets, John, you'd have your eye on that could maybe break into the top 10?
03:26
John Gates
Well, I I still think you see expansion across the south. They just tend to be more affordable than the urban densities um in the northern half of the United States.
03:36
John Gates
So I think uh Raleigh Durham is one, uh Charlotte continues to grow. Atlanta's not exactly a sneaky market, but I think a lot of growth there, Nashville, uh Phoenix continues to grow, Austin.
03:49
John Gates
So I I don't know that I have a new story there for you, but a continuation of a story that's been happening for a little little while here.
03:52
Josh
Uh, any, well, if you were to look at this report, John, we've talked about what it means for different groups. For investors who are listening, what would be the big takeaways?
04:00
John Gates
Well, if if I was a real estate investor, then I would be looking at at markets that have positive net absorption and leasing growth. And if you it tracks very closely with those New York has been very strong for the last two years.
04:09
John Gates
Northern California had a dramatic increase, especially in the city starting last year, and it's continued this year. Dallas has done well this year.
04:18
John Gates
And so that's a good place probably office is an out of favor asset class for sure because of the flight to quality and maybe there's a real opportunity there.
04:26
Josh
Finally, John, give me your area of expertise. I got to get your take on the Fed decision today. What what'd you make of what you saw and heard?
04:32
John Gates
I think down the middle of the fairway. it's it's what we expected. Um I I would have been a little more surprised by a larger move at this point.
04:40
John Gates
that this Fed has shown us that they will be methodical, I guess and and uh somewhat conservative and not bold in making big decisions. So I I think it was about what we expected.
04:49
Josh
John, always good to see you. Thank you.
04:52
John Gates
Great to see you. Thanks again for having me.
