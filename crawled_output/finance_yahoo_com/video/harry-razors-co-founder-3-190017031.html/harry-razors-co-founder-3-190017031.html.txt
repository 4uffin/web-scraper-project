Video Transcript

Speaker A
I want to break down for the the person who's opening their first store or getting their first product on the market. What would you say are your three tips on creating customer loyalty?
00:15
Speaker B
Yeah. I think number one, create a product that is unique and different and better in some way. And make that thing easy to explain. When we sit in meetings sometimes, I'm like, people are like, we want to make a product. I'm like, tell me in like three words how and why this is better.
00:33
Speaker B
I can give you an example. So at Harry's, we launched body wash. And for the longest time, we heard from our customers, we want new body wash, we want new body wash, we want new body wash. And I was like, why? Like there's a lot of body washes out there. like, what what do you want from us in body wash? And finally I was talking to a customer one day and he I was like, why do you want a new body wash from us? And he's like, cuz I don't want to smell like teen spirit anymore. And I was like, okay, that's actually super clear. I get it.
01:00
Speaker A
Smells like teen spirit. I get it.
01:01
Speaker B
We can actually make a product that smells incredible for you.
01:06
Speaker A
Right.
01:06
Speaker B
And so now that is helpful for me. It's like we need a body wash that sudses up and makes you feel clean in the shower and all the great things and helps you smell amazing with sophisticated scents all day long. Great. That is for me, create things people like more.
01:17
Speaker A
Right.
01:17
Speaker B
So, first, I would think about that. Is this product that you're making actually creating things people like more? Like that's the number one thing I'd think about. Number two, um, is like launch and get to know your customer super well, because whatever you think is the create things people like more, you're not you're not going to be sure. Like you're going to want to continue to improve that experience.
01:31
Speaker A
All I can think of is the razor click.
01:32
Speaker B
Totally. You're going to want to continue to improve that experience over time. Make your razor click. Put a precision trimmer on the back. Help it flex better. Create more grip on the handle. There's all these things that you're going to learn over time and so I would view any point as a starting point. And it should be a good starting point. You have to have people like your product to start, but then figure out how you can continually improve it in ways that are going to be meaningful and impactful to people. And then I think the third thing is in the consumer world in particular, I think brand really matters. Like what do you believe in? What do you stand for? Who are you? and like kind of what do you stand against? When we started Harry's, we wanted Harry's to feel warm and approachable and like you're just having an easy conversation with someone who can get get get can get to know you. And the reason why was because there were lots of guys who didn't understand shaving or grooming, couldn't sort of have that conversation. and like, we want to be that place where you can just go and have a very easy, honest, open conversation. It's why we called the brand Harry's, why we chose more masculine colors, why we wanted to be approachable to people and so all those things kind of have to fit together.
02:24
Speaker A
Right.
02:24
Speaker B
And so I'd think about like what do you want your brand to feel like and be like and mean and um you can pull like pictures out of magazines be like, I want to feel like that and not so much like that. But I think
02:30
Speaker A
That was a true authenticity.
02:32
Speaker B
Yeah, and I think it's just like brands I think spark emotion in people. And what emotions do you want people to feel? I think are also a really important thing.
