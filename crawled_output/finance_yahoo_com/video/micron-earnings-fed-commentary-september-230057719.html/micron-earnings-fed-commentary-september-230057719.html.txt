Speaker A
All right, time now for what to watch on Tuesday, September 23rd. Starting off on the earnings front, a couple of big names reporting on Tuesday. That'll be Micron and Auto Zone. Micron announcing results for its fiscal fourth quarter after the market's closed. Analysts expecting a strong quarter for Micron driven by demand for its memory chips, especially the high bandwidth memory used in AI servers.

Speaker A
And taking a look at the Federal Reserve, we'll be getting another round of commentary on Tuesday including remarks from Fed chair J. Powell. Powell's comments come after last week's rate cut from the Central Bank and forceful commentary from his new colleague on the Fed board, Stephen Myron, who said Monday, a fed funds rate could be as low as 2% given what's going on in the current environment.
00:36
Speaker A
And finally, the economic calendar will be highlighted by the preliminary reading on manufacturing and service sector activity from S&P Global. Earlier this month, S&P's manufacturing PMI for August showed the index registe registering its largest monthly gain since May 2022.
