Video Transcript
00:00
Speaker A
All right, Micron out with its fourth quarter results on Tuesday, topping Wall Street's expectations across the board and providing an upbeat outlook. The company reporting adjusted earnings per share of $3.3. That's ahead of forecasts for $2.84. Revenue coming in at 11.32 billion in its latest quarter. That is ahead of the 11.15 that Wall Street was expecting. Stock here up about 3% in immediate reaction to the numbers and joining us now to discuss
00:32
Speaker A
the quarter is Daniel Morgan. He's a VP and senior portfolio manager at Synovus. So, Daniel, I'm curious, uh, your initial reactions to the quarter that we just got from Micron.
00:46
Daniel Morgan
Well, it looks like a strong quarter across the, across the board here. Um, we know that Micron came out about a month ago and guided for this upcoming fourth quarter and they actually beat that as you announced the numbers, uh, 1131 billion in revenues on the fourth quarter, then 303 in EPS, but
01:21
Daniel Morgan
the big positive is the guidance they gave for this upcoming first quarter of 26. The street was looking for 11.7 billion. Uh, they came in at a midpoint of 12.5 billion, I believe. Uh, and also their EPS guide, 360 to 390 a share, midpoint 375, street was looking for 298.
01:46
Daniel Morgan
So, if we look at this report, uh, it looks very, very good. Beat on all metrics. Uh, of course, we'll get a little more info on the conference call, but it appears that, uh, the AI trade is working really well right now for Micron.
02:00
Speaker A
Yeah, and I'm curious, Daniel, when you look at Micron and and the where the company is in its own life cycle relative to the AI trade, where it fits in right now. I mean, you know, you can kind of pick a day of the week, you figure there's going to be an Nvidia headline. Um, kind of feels like they take a lot of air out of the room when it comes to the chip side of the equation. But where is Micron right now both on its, you know, product development side and sort of how it's being seen within this AI arms race?
02:35
Daniel Morgan
Well, you're right. So, let's take a step back and just make sure everybody understands the difference, right? NVIDIA produces GPU chips that go into the servers that run these big AI, uh, data centers. If we look at a company like Micron, they're producing something called high bandwidth memory or uh DRAM. They're use, they're producing the the RAM or the memory that allows this chip to run. So, uh, their biggest area of growth is called HBM, high bandwidth memory. Right now they're producing level three.
03:13
Daniel Morgan
They have level four coming out next year. Uh, so these chips are being paired up with, let's say Nvidia's Blackwell, also with their Rubin chip. Uh, they're also getting some benefit from uh producing memory chips for the new Chat GBT 5, which is going to be coming out from Open AI. So, we have to look at them not as a direct producer of AI chips that would compete against an NVIDIA, but a company that builds a complimentary chip, a memory chip that runs with the NVIDIA GPU. So they're benefiting from what Nvidia is doing.
