Video Transcript
00:00
Speaker A
I want to start you here with what we're seeing those record highs. Who would have thought we'd be here after those lows we saw in April. Bird's eye view. What do you make of all this?
00:12
Jeff
Well, I you started by saying, who would have thought, right? And um, so it goes back to sharing our view of the market this year and our theme going into the year was clear air turbulence, but with a target of 6,600 to potentially 7,000 for the year and we've been pretty steady while a lot of our peers, um, you know, in that April period that you talk about that was very uncomfortable, um, the maximum kind of tariff anxiety moment.
00:53
Jeff
So many folks took their their price targets down. And there was a freak out moment and, you know, we just in the data didn't see that as as warranted. And what kind of keeps us um, focused and objective is the data. Focusing on the fundamentals and um what's going on in the economy and earnings and rates and all of those things were were pretty favorable. So, um I'm we're not surprised to see it. We're also not surprised to see and expect at these record levels, um moments of air pockets, which is part of the clear air turbulence thesis.
01:34
Jeff
you know, nice, nice, you you resume prior altitudes, you have a uh flight to your final destination that's um, you know, enjoyable once you get there, but you're white knuckled on the flight and the path to get there and you kiss the ground when you when you do get to that final profitable destination. I think that's kind of what we've seen here.
01:54
Speaker A
Yeah, and I love that metaphor, Jeff, and maybe we should be bracing for some turbulence. I guess what do you see when it comes to potential volatility?
02:07
Jeff
Yeah, I I just think there are so many things, you know, in your intro um today. You're talking about um relationships with China, more, you know, kind of trade tensions. We've got a government shutdown uh kind of thing that's that's facing us that's also a short-term noise. That's not, you know, long-term scary. But, you know, as we even work through this Fed process and by the way, we'll probably get into this, we think the Fed's doing the right thing, but, you know, there's speculation and, you know, these popcorn, grab your popcorn moments as we go into these meetings, whoa, what are they going to do?
02:51
Jeff
Um, you know, is it 50? Is it zero? Um, what about Fed independence? That's just going to cause these air pockets and when you're at 23 times earnings, yeah, I think you'll get some pullbacks, but I still would have a, you know, um, expectation of higher highs as we move through 2026 into mid 2026 and further. Um, I I think we're on a good path because the data is still good.
