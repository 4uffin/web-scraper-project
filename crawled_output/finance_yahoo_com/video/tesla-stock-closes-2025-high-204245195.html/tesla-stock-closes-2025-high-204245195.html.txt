Video Transcript
00:00
Speaker A
Tesla shares closing the day higher rising over nine of the last 10 trading sessions. Senior Autos Reporter Pro Subramanian stopping by to break down all the recent action that we have seen in Tesla stock, which Proz went from a broken story to one of the better stories in the market.
00:20
Pras Subramanian
I mean, today got a new uh closing high for 2025. Uh last closing high was January 15th, so now we're up what 434. You know, stock up 6% last few days, 30% in a month. I mean, this a roller coaster and but with the upswing part
00:41
Pras Subramanian
right here, right? So we had stuff like must buying a bunch of shares, Robotaxi expansion among a number of things. But also just today was a Alex Potter Piper Sandler up to his price target. He made a visit to China, talked to a lot of EV makers there. you know, they said like, yeah, Chinese assembly makers there are doing better but they still look to Tesla for guidance on AI, AI products, building AI infrastructure. So that's still a the positive thing that Potter sees for Tesla stock. I mean, he did say that, you know, Q3 sales will be a the watershed sort of the the the
01:14
Pras Subramanian
the big moment for them and then it's going to be a little bit weaker for next year. So a little bit of uh headwinds there, but right now it's about the AI trade that the AI sort of the the products that tell them us can do. So that's what what's driving the stock from a today point of view, but we've seen the last month has been insane considering the fact there was a huge sort of drawdown earlier in the year.
01:36
Speaker A
Well, it feels like with Tesla and we've seen, I mean, we've discussed this at length on the show, off off air, you know, in the news room, like this this is what the stock does, right? It goes up 50% or sorry, it goes up 100%, goes down 50%, you know, back and forth and back and forth. Um and and ultimately this is partly what investors sign up for. Uh but it also feels like in these periods between material updates, between earnings announcements, Must comes out with the buy. There's a lot, like the story is just way
02:11
Speaker A
better right now before you get Q3 delivery numbers. And then maybe you have to say, oh, right, they've they've been having a structural problem selling enough cars and seeing growth in that part of the business. But right now, it's like Elon's more involved, stock has a lot of momentum, shorts are finally tired of this round. Uh so it it's just a way better story as we get towards the end of Q3.
02:41
Pras Subramanian
Yeah, I mean look, next week Q3 numbers, right? going to come out. Maybe it's already baked in. Maybe we'll see a blowout number, but it's not but it's not going to be it's not going to trade on that, right? It's going to be about what we think is the the the the zeitgeist story of Tesla right now.
