4 ways Fed rate cuts can affect your wallet
Yahoo Finance Video
Mon, Sep 22, 2025, 5:00 AM
The Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 25 basis points at its September meeting on Wednesday — the first rate cut in 2025. The US central bank currently forecasts two more rate cuts in 2025. Yahoo Finance Personal Finance and Banking Editor Casey Bond joins Mind Your Money with Allie Canal to explain what Fed rate cuts actually mean for your wallet.

Video Transcript
00:00
Speaker A
The Federal Reserve just delivered a long-awaited quarter-point rate cut this week, but what does that actually mean for your money? It can affect everything from your bank accounts, to loans, to credit cards, and even your investments. I'm joined now by Yahoo Finance Personal Finance editor Casey Bond to break it all down. So Casey, let's start with the basics here. How does a Fed rate cut affect checking and savings accounts?
00:30
Casey Bond
Sure. Well, checking and savings account rates are set by individual financial institutions based on a number of factors. Um that includes market competition, uh whether or not they want to encourage more deposits. But in general, they also do follow the federal funds rate. So when the Fed raises or lower rates, um savings and checking accounts tend to fall in line with those movements. Um with this recent rate cut, it was a modest one. so we shouldn't expect rates to change too dramatically. Um but the best savings account rates in particular have hovered around 4% APY. So we may see fewer accounts offering rates that high.
01:21
Speaker A
And what about certificates of deposits, otherwise known as CDs? How would this cut maybe affect those types of savings?
01:34
Casey Bond
Sure. Well, similar to savings and checking accounts, CD rates also are tied to the federal funds rate. Um so with this most recent cut, we can expect those rates to start coming down. Um the unique benefit of a CD, however, is that it allows you to earn a guaranteed rate through the entire term, whether you choose, you know, six months, one year, two year. Um so if you know that rates are going to be falling and there are additional cuts on the table for 2025, it's a great strategy to put your savings into a CD and lock in that higher rate now. So as rates fall, you're still earning a more competitive rate.
02:26
Speaker A
And how do personal loans change when rates come down?
02:32
Casey Bond
Sure. Well, personal loans are typically one of the more affordable financing options, whether you're looking to consolidate credit card debt or, you know, finance a large purchase. And in recent years, the average rate has hovered around 12%. Um so again, with the recent federal funds rate cut, um we can't expect that rate to drop slightly. Um but it is important to note that personal loan rates are tied to the individual applicant's credit as well. So those who have good to excellent credit are really the ones who are going to achieve the best rates available, um even into the high single digits.
03:22
Speaker A
You mentioned credit card debt and let's stick to the borrowing conversation. What happens to credit card rates in this type of environment?
03:32
Casey Bond
Sure. So when it comes to credit card rates, those are very closely tied to the prime rate, which is basically the interest rate that banks reserve for their most creditworthy customers. Um of course, that prime rate is also tied to the federal funds rate. So there is a correlation between the Fed's target rate and credit card rates. Um, credit cards remain one of the most expensive borrowing options today and lately, the average rate has hovered around 21, 22%. So even if rates do come down a little bit, it's still not great to carry a lot of credit card debt. and it's a great of time as any to look into ways to consolidate and lower that rate, whether it's through a personal loan or even a 0% APR balance transfer card.
04:30
Speaker A
And finally, Casey, how does the Fed's interest rate policy filter through to investments for everyday Americans?
04:42
Casey Bond
Sure. Well, Fed rate cuts are generally good news for the market. Um when it costs less to borrow money, companies can afford to spend more money on, you know, daily operations and expansion and that translates to higher stock values. So, um in the coming days, many investors will probably see their investment values tick upward. Um it is important to note, however, that investing is really a long-term play. Um so you should be basing those decisions around having, you know, a well-diversified portfolio, your time horizon, your risk tolerance, um and not so much what the Fed is doing day-to-day.
05:32
Speaker A
Casey, some great advice there. Thanks so much. Appreciate it.
