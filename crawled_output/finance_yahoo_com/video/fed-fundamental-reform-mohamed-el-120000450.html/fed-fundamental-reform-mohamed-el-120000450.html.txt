The Fed is in need of 'fundamental reform': Mohamed El-Erian
Yahoo Finance Video
and Julie Hyman
Sat, September 20, 2025 at 7:00 AM CDT
After the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 25 basis points, economist Mohamed El-Erian tells Julie Hyman on Market Catalysts that the Fed needs "fundamental reform." El-Erian, who is the president of Queens College Cambridge, former chair of President Obama's Global Development Council, and former deputy director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), emphasizes the importance of "cognitive diversity" within the Fed. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Catalysts.

Speaker A
Now, you a couple of months ago made some waves by suggesting that J. Powell should step down already.
undefined
Speaker B
On your show.
undefined
Speaker A
As head of the central bank. Exactly, we talked about it. Um, you faced a lot of skepticism, uh, on that, um, from various quarters. And now you're saying, even if he doesn't step down, there are certain changes he should be making now to put the Fed on better footing going into the leadership change. What what changes should he be making?
undefined
Speaker B
So let's talk with that discussion of July. At the time I was worried that because of the the tensions between the president and the chair, if Chair Paul didn't step down, the attacks on the Fed would multiply. And that's exactly what happened. And it is continuing to happen. And the reason why is very simple, the administration is looking for cause, a reason to fire chair Powell. When you look at an institution, take a
undefined
Speaker B
microscope to it, you will find something. And they are finding one thing after the other, and in the process, the objective of the administration is changing. Who would have thought in July that they would have their eye on the reappointment of the regional Fed presidents in February. But suddenly that's there. So, what I was afraid of is happening. The other thing that's happening is now there's a massive understanding about something you and I have talked about before, is you need fundamental reforms to the Fed.
undefined
Speaker B
You need greater accountability, you need greater transparency, and you need less group think. And we have really good examples of other central banks that have addressed these issues. The Bank of England, for example, has external members on the equivalent of the FOMC. And those external members guard against group think because if you're within the Fed, the incentive to be in the herd and not question it.
undefined
Speaker A
Well, but at the same time, on the one hand, you have this huge dispersion in the dots, which we called sort of a messy meeting. On the other hand, you don't want group think. I mean, don't the dots illustrate that there isn't group think?
undefined
Speaker B
And that's the problem. People are saying, so let me get this right. We have dispersions in where we're going. We have inflation going up, we have growth going up. We have employment according to the Fed only peaking at 4.5% and coming back down and yet we're cutting. You would have expected two-sided descents. That's what you get at the Bank of England. We didn't, we got one descent. In fact, one of the big surprises is we only got one descent.
undefined
Speaker B
And and I think it's important to understand what happens in a group dynamic is that it you tend to iterate and converge towards a view. And that unfortunately undermines the sort of cognitive diversity you need at turning points. There is a reason why the Fed has been consistently late because they don't have the amount of cognitive diversity that they need to say what if. I thought Stephen
undefined
Speaker B
was really interesting when he said, I'm not the smartest in the room, but I'm willing to ask the questions that other people aren't willing to ask. And I think that the Fed needs more of that.
undefined
Speaker A
But a voice like Myron or whoever ends up being the the Trump appointed uh nominee to replace Powell, how do you separate an earnest intellectual discussion from someone who is effectively a plant of the administration.
undefined
Speaker B
So look at the Bank of England. All the external appointees are people that have come either from economics or finance. They've come from outside the government, outside the Central Bank. It's understood they're going to serve one or two terms and go back to the outside. So they are technocrats. And then they join other people that have different backgrounds. And that's the whole point of cognitive diversity is you bring different viewpoints.
undefined
Speaker B
And it's really important. My career has shown that when you have different viewpoints in the room and you can talk about it in a safe area, you get better outcomes.
