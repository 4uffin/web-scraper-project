Trump goes to Supreme Court as he pursues removal of Fed's Cook
Yahoo Finance Video
Thu, Sep 18, 2025, 2:32 PM
President Trump has brought his fight against the Federal Reserve to the US Supreme Court, asking the high justices whether he can be allowed to fire Fed governor Lisa Cook while she contests her filings. This comes after central bank officials cut interest rates by 25 basis points, where Cook voted alongside recent Trump appointee Stephen Miran at this FOMC meeting.
Yahoo Finance senior Fed correspondent Jennifer Schonberger reports the latest news around Lisa Cook's legal proceedings and challenge to the administration's claims that she committed mortgage fraud. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination.
Video Transcript

Josh
Well, the high stakes showdown over Federal Reserve independence heads to the Supreme Court. President Trump is asking the justices to remove Lisa Cook from that powerful board a day after it cut interest rates for the first time in months.
00:09
Josh
Fed correspondent Jennifer Schonberger joining us now. Jen.

Jennifer Schonberger
Good afternoon, Josh. As expected, the Trump administration has appealed to the Supreme Court to allow the President to remove Fed Governor Lisa Cook from the Fed Board of Governors while the High Court considers a lawsuit challenging the president's efforts to fire her.
00:26
Jennifer Schonberger
This emergency request coming after a federal appeals court here in Washington rejected the administration's attempts to try to remove Cook ahead of the Fed's policy meeting this week, where Cook voted to lower rates.
00:37
Jennifer Schonberger
The Solicitor General John Sauer argues that allegations that Cook committed mortgage fraud are sufficient cause to fire Cook, a cause that two lower courts have rejected.
00:46

Both courts have also granted Cook an injunction to continue serving on the board as these legal proceedings continue.
00:54
Jennifer Schonberger
Sauer has asked the court to allow the administration to immediately remove Cook from the board even before the justices issue a decision on the emergency request.
01:04
Jennifer Schonberger
Cook's lawyers expected to file a counter suit with the High Court later today. Cook has sued the president, alleging that he is concocting an excuse to try to fire her and create a vacancy on the Federal Reserve board that he can fill with a person he sees fit as a way as a threat to Central Bank independence.
01:23
Jennifer Schonberger
Of course, the president has been hammering the Central Bank to lower rates since he took office, and on Wednesday, the Central Bank moved to lower its benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point for the first time this year, signaling two more rate cuts this year as well.
