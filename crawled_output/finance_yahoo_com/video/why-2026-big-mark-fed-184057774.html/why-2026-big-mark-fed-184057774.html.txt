Why 2026 is 'a big question mark' for the Fed
Yahoo Finance Video
Wed, Sep 17, 2025, 1:40 PM
The Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points at its September meeting. In its updated outlook, most FOMC members expect further rate cuts this year, but things get murkier heading into 2026. In the video above, EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco and J.P. Morgan Asset Management global market strategist Meera Pandit discuss the decision and outlook for the Fed and the economy heading into next year. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination.

Speaker A
I think one very interesting dimension here is that we're seeing this growing split in the dot plot of median rate height expectations. You have one rate uh expectation which is below 3% for the end of the year. That's likely uh Stephen Myran's estimate. Um but most of the the view is still that we're going to see two to three rate cuts over the course of 2025, but less easing, interestingly enough, in 2026.
00:36
Speaker B
Um, so how does this comport with what we were expecting in terms of what the market was expecting? And we are seeing a little bit of a lift to stocks, for example, but not a huge move upward. That could change during the press conference, but what do you make of of the dots and the implications?
01:05
Speaker C
25 basis points was largely expected for this meeting. Look, if the Fed had gone 50, I think the market would have been a little bit more prepared for it given what happened last year. But I would say overall, we have three conversations in any of these cycles, whether it's hiking or cutting. It is first the direction of travel. We know cutting is the the the direction we're going in. The second is around the pace, and then the third is around the end point, where do we stop? Where is the terminal rate? And right now we're in that pacing conversation. So it is interesting to see that the Fed does see a little bit more cutting this year. I think that again, that is broadly expected. But next year is such a big question mark and it seems like what the Fed has phased out here is we want to be attentive to the risks in the labor market when you see the massive slowdown in labor market momentum that we have seen over the last couple of months. That's an important consideration. But as we head into next year, remember that consumers will get some pretty big refunds when it comes to taxes. That will likely lift consumption and therefore growth. Corporations will also get some tax corporate sweeteners, so to speak, not necessarily cuts, but those provisions may lift profitability and lift capX. So we could be in a situation next year where growth has sped up, where inflation has either sped up or stayed elevated. We actually don't see it peaking until June of next year. And so that would imply that all of a sudden, the Fed is go, go, go, and then stop a little bit in into next year, and I think that's reflected in the dots for next year.
