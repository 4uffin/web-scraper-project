Fed rate cut decision: Top Story

For more live coverage of markets watch the full episode of Market Sunrise and head to Yahoo Finance.
Video Transcript
00:03
Speaker A
Well, the Fed is on the verge of its first rate cut of 2025. Traders are pricing in a 96% chance of a 25 basis point rate cut and a 4% chance of a jumbo reduction. But will it keep going? Now, remember, we have a weak job market, sticky inflation, and of course, pressure from the White House to contend with.
00:23
Speaker A
One clue will come from the Fed's dot plot. This is a chart that's updated every three months and shows each official's prediction about the direction of rates. June's dot plot showed that there was consensus for two cuts this year, but back then, there was perhaps more uncertainty surrounding tariffs, immigration, and the impact of taxes on the economy.
00:46
Speaker A
We'll also be getting some housing data out later today. Economists are forecasting that housing starts to fall to an annualized rate of 1.37 million last month, while building permits are expected to tick up slightly.
01:00
Speaker A
One person who had been calling for rate cuts for some time has been Senator Elizabeth Warren. But does she still believe that a rate cut is expected today? Well, she's been speaking to my colleague, Jennifer Schonberger.
01:13
Elizabeth Warren
So look, I've argued for two years now that I want the Fed to cut rates. I thought that inflation was well under control, headed in the right direction, and the Fed could bring down uh the the interest rates.
01:30
Elizabeth Warren
The problem now is that Donald Trump's chaos has so weakened the economy that we're watching the first signs of stagflation and that is that inflation is tilting up and unemployment is tilting up simultaneously.
01:52
Elizabeth Warren
The Fed, of course, only has one tool and it uses it differently. If inflation is going up, it raises interest rates. If unemployment's going up, it lowers interest rates. And this is this is the box that Donald Trump has created.
02:11
Elizabeth Warren
You know, I think there's something important to underline here and that is the Chairman of the Federal Reserve said last month that the Fed would have lowered interest rates last February if only Donald Trump had not created so much economic chaos.
02:34
Elizabeth Warren
So the way I see this is one person right now is responsible for the high costs of at the higher uh interest rates and for the increasing problems that we're seeing in the employment market. And that one person is Donald Trump.
02:59
Jennifer Schonberger
But should we anticipate, do you think the rate cut is the right thing to do here given what's going on on the inflation front, given your concerns?
03:07
Elizabeth Warren
I think that the Donald Trump and the chaos in this economy are backing the Fed into a box. I am really worried now about those unemployment numbers. I still want to see the Fed cut interest rates, but it would have been so much better to cut them when we had a strong economy and strong employment.
