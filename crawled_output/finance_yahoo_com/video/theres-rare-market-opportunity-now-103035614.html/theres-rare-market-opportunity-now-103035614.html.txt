Great Hill Capital chairman and managing member Thomas Hayes says there is an opportunity in this subset of US stocks that occurs only four times every 100 years. Watch the video above to hear more.

Video Transcript

Julie
The stocks are pulling back to start the week after notching new record highs on Friday. Still, September is defying its reputation so far as a historically weak month for stocks and many Wall Street strategists say there's still room to run. Joining me now, Thomas Hayes, Great Hill Capital Chairman and managing member who with us in the studio. Tom, it's good to see you.
00:23
Tom Hayes
Great to be here, Julie.
00:24
Julie
So, let's talk macro for a moment, and this a little bit of a pause here this morning, but we have had this big upsurge.
00:32
Tom Hayes
Yeah.
00:33
Julie
Anything, you've been pretty bullish.
00:34
Tom Hayes
I have been bullish, uh and that's worked, but I I do think we could be due for a pause. There's an old Wall Street Maxim, you've been around, sell Rush Hosanna, buy Yam Kapoor.
00:46
Julie
Right.
00:47
Tom Hayes
And, you know, more than 2/3 of the time, this uh last week, week and a half of September tends to be a week time. On average uh down about uh 0.4% in the S&P 500, 0.5% in the Dow Jones Industrial. I think that's the bad news, Julie. So maybe a little short-term volatility. The good news, you got so many tailwinds. Number one, you got consumer sentiment completely washed out at levels not seen since the COVID lows and prior to that, the European debt crisis in 2011 and the great financial crisis in 2008. What happened 12 months later when consumer sentiment was this low and washed out, S&P was up 24.1%. Uh the other thing you have, as we know now, is the tailwinds of the Fed cuts. And if, you know, right now markets expecting four to five cuts over the next 12 months, uh in an expansion, if we don't go into recession, we're showing no signs of immediate recession. GDP is still positive. You have up 16.1% over the next 12 months. And then you got earnings accelerating. So, uh estimates for next year, 13.7% earnings growth, up from $300 a share to $305 a share. Uh so I think the theme is going to be pick your spots because maybe the indices don't do quite as well prospectively as they've done in the rear view mirror the last few months. Uh but under the surface some tremendous opportunity.
02:00
Julie
Okay, where's the spot?
02:01
Tom Hayes
Okay. Well, first thing, we've got a four times in a 100-year opportunity in small caps. Small caps valuation relative to large caps has only been this low, this will be the fourth time in 100 years. Uh last time was the early 2000s, over the next six years, you had dramatic outperformance. uh Fed cuts are a huge catalyst for this because they can refinance their debt. They have faster earnings growth relative to the S&P. They have a lower multiple relative to the S&P. So, I know a lot of value guys and girls have been calling for small caps for a long time.
02:44
Julie
Really? I haven't noticed, Tom. I don't know what you're talking about.
02:46
Tom Hayes
But for all of our technicians out there, they're actually starting to break out. Not that the fundamen- uh fundamentalists really care, but it's a good sign.
