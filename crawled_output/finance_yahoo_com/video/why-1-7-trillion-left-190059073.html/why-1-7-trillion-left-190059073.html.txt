There was one study that said half of Uber drivers are over age 50. Um, I think part of that is for the money and part of that's back to our conversation of how do you get out and talk to people, um, and, and make connections. So, um, I think there's a lot of things that people need to think about.
0:20
spk_1
Living longer isn't just a gift, it's a financial planning challenge that requires answers to some pretty tough questions. In her new book, The 2nd 50, Deborah Whitman, who is AARP's chief public policy officer, tackles the uncertainties that keep many of us up at night. How long will you live? Will you stay healthy enough? Will you lose your memory? How long will you need to keep working? And yes, she even addresses in her new book How You'll die.And in this episode of Decoding Retirement, we're going to continue our mission of being your first and last stop in your journey for trustworthy retirement planning information. Deb, welcome to Decoding Retirement. Thanks for having me, Bob. It's a pleasure. So, let's start here. Um, the book I'm told is born out of your own personal journey of turning 50. Can you share a couple, uh, of the surprising personal discoveries you made when you were writing and researching this book?
1:18
spk_0
Yeah, so I, um, I'd been working on aging issues my whole career for 25 years. I said the Social Security Administration, I ran a Senate ging committee, and then I've been in the AARP for over a decade.And then when I was about to turn 50, it all suddenly became a lot more real. Um, and so I wrote down those questions that you were talking about, um, because those were, I think, questions that I would have or anybody would have as they age. Um, and then I dove into the research. I talked to experts, I interviewed people all over the country. We surveyed them because I'm a researcher. Um, and I'll say I learned a lot on this journey, uh,Things that I thought might be true. Um, I learned from the expert Mart, um, or things that I knew, like, women live longer than men. I didn't know why. And so really understanding all of those things was, um, informative and engaging for me and hopefully for the readers as well.
2:16
spk_1
Yeah. So I often think of retirement planning as complicated, filled with contradictions, filled with complexity. Is there one thing that, um, you changed in your life after you sort of did all this research and all this writing?
2:31
spk_0
Well, I knew the things we all sort of do that we need to do to be healthy and are as we age, so things like eating right and exercising, and, um, and not smoking or drinking too much. Uh, and in fact, if you do all 5 of those, you gain an additional 10 years of life expectancy. Um, even if you do one, you gain 2 years, so, um, you don't have to be perfect. But I didn't know how important relationships were, soI interviewed Bob Waldinger, who wrote The Good Life. Um, lovely, lovely person, uh, Zen Buddhist priest. And he looked, um, he has this incredible panel of people that they surveyed over and over again, of course, across their lives. And he looked at the 80 year olds and he said, Well, what's the difference between the healthy 80-year-olds and the unhealthy ones? And he looked back in their their 50s and itIt wasn't that they had lower cholesterol. It wasn't that they were eating right and exercise. It was really the quality of their relationships. And so I took that as, you know, um, you know, a hardworking mom, that I actually needed to make sure I reached out to my friends, um, build community and things that weren't necessarily just associated with my kids. So, um, I think that's been, um, maybe probably theMost important health wise, and probably the most important life wise um piece that I could take away from it.
4:01
spk_1
Yeah, it's interesting. Uh, I know that there are studies that show loneliness and isolation actually lead to decreased life expectancy.And the other interesting thing is, um, women do a much better job at, uh, having lifelong relationships or even building new relationships as they age. Men, on the other hand, not so much, and, uh, most men I know have a t-shirt that has the word curmudgeon on the front of it. And, uh, and that anyway, but so I, I guess my question is, what advice do you have for men who might have a particularly hard job at sort of maintaining or building relationships as they age, which to me would seem so important given what you just said.
4:38
spk_0
Yeah, so, uh, you're right, isolation can be deadly. Um, they estimate that it's being isolated is like smoking 15 cigarettes a day.Um, but what connection means is different for each of us. Um, I am an introvert. I wouldn't mind sitting at home all weekend reading a book, and my husband wants to go out and see lots of people. Um, and so finding what's, what are the connections that are meaningful to you, I think is really important. The, um, it could be.Friends or family can be a sibling or a cousin that you're connected to and feel that you can pick up the phone and talk to them anytime. Or it could be just saying hello to the person at a checkout. Um, in England, they're setting up these, um, sort of sheds with tools where older guys can come and help, help fix things for the whole neighborhood. And maybe they talk to each other, maybe they don't. Um, it can be parallel play like kids used to do, butUm, it's a chance to sort of feel part of something and to be doing something. So finding those opportunities, I think can be really important in your life as you age.
5:45
spk_1
Yeah. One of the things that scares many Americans about aging is this notion that they may suffer from cognitive decline, dementia, Alzheimer's as they age, and where people are often fond of saying it's not the uh quantity of days, it's the quality of days that you have to live andAs you know, the dementia is often referred to as the long goodbye, um, I, I guess, how do you address this fear? Like, what advice do you have for folks whoAre, are, are keen of mind now but fear what could come in the decades to come.
6:20
spk_0
Well, well, two pieces. One, the fear is greater than the reality. So half of us think that we will get cognitive decline in dementia, but only about 15% of people even in their late 70s, actually have it, so it's, it's less than we think. And then second is kind of empowering people. People think it's inevitable, there's nothing that they can do, when actually 80% of dementias worldwide.Can be prevented or or delayed. And so, as an individual, all those things they said you can do to be, um, healthy as you age. So that's eating right and exercising and having community, um, also help our brain health, um, adding sleep to that, um, as important, um, adding, keeping cognitively stimulated, so using your brain is really important.So, so both, let's, let's talk about the real risks, let's talk about what we can do about it, and then let's have a society where we can actually help care for the people, um, and, and make sure that we're using the capacities that people do have, um, along the journey. And so, I, I think there's a lot more we can do in this area than we mostly sort of write off the time.
7:33
spk_1
Uh, another worry that people have, Deb, is outliving their money in retirement, and, uh, there are some studies that suggest that this worry is a little bit overblown in part because people's satisfaction in retirement irrespective of money, uh, tends to be high as long as a couple of things are in place, like maybe they retired on their own terms, maybe they're in good health, maybe they're still married, etc. but talk a little bit about this fear about living money and and what they can do to deal with that.Yeah,
8:01
spk_0
so it'sit's, it's hard to save for these long periods, and it's also hard to save for really expensive things that happen as we age. She brought up dementia. Dementia is incredibly expensive to the family, um, because while we have Medicare, which provides healthcare, andVisits to your doctor and hospital visits, it does not provide any long-term care. Um, and so most of the time, families are on their own to fund that. And it, dementia care can be, um, in this area, I've talked to several people that are paying $200,000 a year.Um, which, even if you were a really great saver your whole life, um, you're going to run through all of your assets really quickly. Uh, that said, Medicaid, and this is what most people then rely on, um, does help people with long term care, but you have to have spent down, um, all of your savings and have low income, and it varies by state. So, um, the, the problem with retirement is there's a lot of big unknowns.And a lot of holes that we can fall in, and we don't know basic things like how many years I'm gonna need it, what are the costs, um, what, um, what am I, uh, gonna have a return on my own savings, what's going to happen to Social Security? We we place a lot of uncertainty on people as they age, and what we're seeing is a lot more people are working longer.Um, or going back to work to try and add a little income in as they age, um, and some of that, you know, um,And there was one study that said half of Uber drivers are over age 50. Um, I think part of that is for the money, and part of that's back to our conversation of how do you get out and talk to people, um, and, and make connections. So, um, I think there's a lot of things that people need to think about and you just really don't make it easy for people.
9:59
spk_1
You might know the folks over at the retirement manifesto by chance if that, uh, if that blog rings a bell.And I think this notion of sort of um having a general idea of what retirement's going to be like is is really important, maybe even practicing retirement and, and to then know that it's not always going to go as planned, right? There, there'll be lots of changes that occur along the way, uh, healthcare shocks, deaths, um, grandchildren, etc. right? So be, be, be prepared as as much as you can, but also be prepared for the unexpected.
10:34
spk_0
Yeah. And one thing you said about, uh, you know, sort of, um, taking an assessment of what you have, when I was writing the book, I was shocked at how much money is left behind in lost 401ks. So, you know, I've had 4 or 5 jobs. Um, many people over the course of their career have.And, and there's $1.7 trillion of unclaimed assets in 401 cases. And so, um, you know, really checking back through all of your old employers and making sure you know where your money is and ideally consolidating it so it's easier to manage, I think is aUm, a good thing to do in our, our 40s and our 50s and um things when those things are fresh and we know how to reach out to the, the HR department or others to find those dollars that we might might have lost. Yeah,
11:24
spk_1
I can't tell you how many family members I've helped roll their 401k over to an IRA or to their new employer. Uh, I just did it for my daughter.And I have another family member who I won't name, but, uh, is has left some of her 401ks at her former employer and despite my insistence that she rolled them over, she tells me it's too hard.
11:44
spk_0
So itis hard. It is hard, and we're actually trying to get sort of packs between employers and financial advisors to do that automatically, particularly for small accounts, but it's way harder than it needs to be.
11:58
spk_1
Yeah.Deb, we have to take a short break and when we come back, we'll pick up where we left off if that's OK. Of course.Welcome back to Decoding Retirement. I'm speaking with Deb Whitman. She's the author of The 2nd 50. She's also AARP's chief public policy officer. Uh, Deb, one of the topics in your book is where someone will live, and, and I know according to AARP research, somewhere between 80 and 90% of older adults wants to age in place either in their home where they raise their children or maybe age in community.Uh, what do folks need to know about the challenges that they will face when they have this desire?
12:37
spk_0
Yeah, you're right, most of us don't want to move when we get older. We have our friends, we have our doctors, we have our uh butchers, we have all kinds of things in our um areas that we like to go to.Um, unfortunately though, almost all of our housing isn't developed for people as they age. And I will just admit, I never thought about this myself until, uh, my father-in-law's 94-year-old girlfriend came over to visit, and I've got 6 stairs from the door up and 6 stairs down.And she looked at those like they were Mount Kilimanjaro, and I realized, wait a minute, we're going to have a hard time in here if we can't walk up those stairs. And even when my husband had knee surgery, you know, sort of had to slide a slide up the stairs. So, you know, um, yes, people want to stay where they are, but sometimes our houses aren't designed for that.Um, other times we can modify. Um, and, um, knowing what, and thinking about this early is really important. My, my parents, um, you know, the most important thing for them is to stay in their house. And so, um, they're basically figured out how to be on one floor, uh, for most of the things that they do. So, um,Making sure that your house is accessible and, and not just for your future, but also that some people can come and visit you, um, like a, like, like Flo when she came over to visit me.
14:11
spk_1
So the thought is either live with it, uh, refurbish it, retrofit it or move into maybe a a condo or apartment where there are elevators where you can get to where you need to be.
14:23
spk_0
Yeah, we're not even building enough of those, um, unfortunately, I'm so glad you mentioned this program. So, um, so for people that haven't heard about it, um, you're right, it was a model from the World Health Organization. We now have 1000 cities and communities across the country. We have 12 states and another 12 in development. Um, just before I got on this podcast, I saw that, uh, Mississippi, uh, just put out their plan.Um, and the plans, what, what I love about them is they think about housing and transportation and healthcare and civic engagement, um, and a whole range of different domains that we need to be planning for as our society ages. Um, and I am sure your local plan is different than the plan in Mississippi or in, um, Washington.DC that where I am right now, or Montgomery County where I live, um, each, each one is really based on what that community needs. Um, and, and like you said, in, in places where they've got lots of old homes, um, really thinking through, well, OK, well, how can we build better? Um, how can we use our zoning to encourage housing so that Bob can stay in his newNeighborhood, uh, maybe just a little down the street, um, in a place that, um, is better for him. Um, I think, I think this is, this is, this is the problem with aging is, um, both it sneaks up on us as individuals, and we as a society really haven't opened our eyes to the changing demographics and all the things that we need to do to make it easier for everybody.
16:07
spk_1
Yeah, in my community, we're approaching almost a third of residents are aged 65 and older, so it's a very.It's an aging community. Um, and I would just applaug. There are two things I think worth mentioning. One is folks can go on AARP to get, uh, a sense of how livable their community is, if I'm not mistaken, by entering their zip code and you'll get a score based on all those factors like housing and transportation and civic participation, etc. so you have a sense of where you stand relative to the rest of the universe. That's, that's one, right?
16:38
spk_0
Yeah, my experts put together what we call the livability index. So if you type in livability index AARP and you can type in your neighborhood by zip code and you can compare it to other neighborhoods, um, or different parts of the community. And so it's been a great tool. We work with the National Association of Realtors to hand this out when people are buying houses.Um, but also a great thing for community leaders of where to focus resources. Um, so I think it's, it's, uh, it's, it's been a huge way for us to measure things at the local level then that we can try and work onimproving. Yeah,
17:15
spk_1
and I would suggest to anyone listening, if you don't live in a community or a state that has an age-friendly plan, you should become your own best advocate and see if you can get funds to do a needs assessment and then put in place a plan. It's aIt's worth it from my perspective. Well, and
17:30
spk_0
the Mississippi one I just read engaged 10,000 people in the state to to develop the plan. Um, and so all of these are really bottom up based on, you know, people like you using their voice and pushing for things that they think are important.
17:44
spk_1
Yeah. Uh, speaking of things that are really important, um, many people don't like to talk about end of life issues, but it is something that is well worth talking about. Uh, tell us what you found and what you wrote in the book about that.
17:58
spk_0
Yeah, I, this was probably the most interesting chapter for me to write, because I knew so little. Um, and so I, um, interviewed, um, a palliative care nurse to find out what it's like to be with somebody when they're dying. Like, how do you know was my basic question. Um, I, uh, interviewed, um, um, a widow.To see their experience. And, um, one of the best conversations I had was with Dr. Diane Meyer, who's a, a palliative care MacArthur genius. I said, Diane, you know, I'm going to tell everybody to get their write their advanced directives, right? That we need everybody needs one. And she said, no, actually, both the research shows that for the most part they're not followed.And when they are can lead to tragic consequences. So some people, you know, years ago, look at this when they're healthy, do you want to be on a ventilator? Check, no. And then COVID hits and you have a document that said, do not put me on a ventilator, even ifYou could be on it for, you know, a few weeks, uh, and improve and get off. And so, um, she said that it's much, much better to have somebody that you talk to about what's important to you and your wishes that can look at the situation you're in and and help provide advice, um, if you can't do that for yourself. And so, um, that was a huge insight for me. Um, a second one is I said, Well, Diane, everybody shouldShould die at home, right? We should make that, um, possible. And, and again, she said, um, it's not right for everybody. You know, sometimes, uh, the family can't take care of the physical issues themselves. Uh, dying is hard. Um, it can be painful for the person and having, you know, more medical support in a hospital or, or, or in a hospice, uh, um, bed might actually be allow the family to be more present for the person.Um, and help ease suffering. And so, all of these things, I think, um, as I was looking at it, um, just helped me to realize how diverse our experiences are as we age, you know, just like they are for the first half, uh, uh, for the 1st 50, for the books, the 2nd 50, the, um, you know, the, our second 50s, nobody has the same, um, pathway, and, um, butKnowing what some of the, um, options are and knowing what we, what the experts are saying and looking at in this area, to me, I think is, um, is just as helpful as the, you know, what to expect when you're expecting a book that I had when I was pregnant with my kids. That's why, that's why I wrote thisbook.
20:42
spk_1
All right, so speaking of the book, if you had to boil it all down into one piece of overarching advice for our listeners and viewers, what would that be?
20:53
spk_0
Um, I, I, you and I are planners, otherwise we wouldn't be on this podcast and probably your listeners as well. So I think planning is important, um, but a piece of that plan is really figuring out what's, what is the most meaningful, um, thing to you.Uh, so, um, in talking to my parents, the most important thing, as I said earlier, is they want to stay in their house. Uh, they live on a lake, there's nothing they like better than to look on their deck at the lake. And so, you know, I wrote up a 9 point plan of what they need to do if they're going to stay in their homes, they're 89 now. Uh,Um, it's still on the desk gathering dust, but, uh, but that's the kind of thing that we need to do is say, OK, well, if I, if I want to stay here, well, then I have to have enough physical capacity to get out of bed, right? So what is that going to take strength? Um, I'm probably not going to be able to take care of my lawn.Forever. So, who do I need to get in? Now, I heard when I went to visit my mom was wheat eating at 89. Um, so, so they've decided at this point they could take care of their own life. Um, at what point can't I drive? They live in a rural place. What am I gonna need for that? You know, these are the types of things of like, OK, well, what's important to me, and then how do I build.Um, either community or, um, or paid or, um, public resources or reaching out to friends of, uh, how do they do it. I think all of those things need to be part of our plan, but based on, based on what
22:26
spk_1
matters. I'm afraid we've come to the end of our podcast today, so thank you for being here with us.
22:32
spk_0
It's been a great conversation. Thanks for having me, Bob.
22:35
spk_1
So that wraps up this episode of Decoding Retirement. We hope we provided you with some actionable advice to help you better plan for or live in retirement. And don't forget, if you've got questions about retirement, you can email me at YF podcast@yahoo Inc.com and we'll do our best to answer your question.
