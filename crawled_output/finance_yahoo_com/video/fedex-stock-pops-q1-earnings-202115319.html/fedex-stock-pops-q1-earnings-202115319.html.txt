Speaker A
FedEx reporting its first quarter results and taking a look now at the numbers. So Q1 adjusted EPS 383, the street was at 359.
00:15
Speaker A
Uh Q1 revenue 22.2 billion versus estimates of 21.67 billion. So beats there on the bottom and the top.
00:26
Speaker A
Q1 adjust operating margins, 5.8%. That's also better. Uh it looks like the estimate was 5.62%.
00:36
Speaker A
Also, importantly, FedEx does reinstate its full year profit outlook. Investors are going to appreciate that. So they see full year adjust EPS between 1720 to 19.
00:49
Speaker A
Looks like the estimate was at 1825. Uh stock higher here about 6% in the after hours, of course. Um, it's been rough for year to date, heading into this into this print, the stock was down about 20% this year heading into the print.
01:07
Speaker A
Despite that or maybe in part because of it, mo most analysts on the street tell their clients that they think this one is a buy here. The average target by the way in the street per Bloomberg is around 261.
01:21
Speaker A
Investors are going to have plenty of questions on the call, of course, delivery volumes, uh consumer and business trends, tariff impact, also the end of the the de minimis exemption. That would all be front and center, but at least initially here a nice pop in the after hours for FedEx up more than 5% here.
