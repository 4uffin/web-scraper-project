Understand the math behind retirement guidelines
Yahoo Finance Video
Tue, September 23, 2025 at 2:00 PM CDT
As prices and inflation continue to rise, preparing ahead for retirement has become even more important. But how can people assess their eventual costs and ensure they don't exceed their sources of income when the future is so difficult to predict? On this week's episode of Decoding Retirement, host Robert "Bob" Powell speaks with Jean Chatzky, host of the HerMoney Podcast, about her proven strategies to build up the savings you will rely on through your golden years. Jean discusses the importance of calculating your day-to-day costs, valuable financial tools that could provide extra income, and whether retirees can still count on Social Security to support them. Yahoo Finance's Decoding Retirement is hosted by Robert Powell. Find more episodes of Decoding Retirement at https://finance.yahoo.com/videos/series/decoding-retirement.
Video Transcript

Speaker A
Fidelity, T-Ro price, other companies have put up retirement savings guidelines of how much money people need to have saved at age 40, 50, 65. And some of these milestones are, if if you're age 40, you might need 1.5 to three times your salary set aside at age 50, 3.5 to six, at age 60, six times to 11 times your current salary set aside for retirement in order to fund your desired lifestyle.
00:30
Speaker A
Any thoughts about these guidelines and whether people should be using them?
00:33
Speaker B
You know, I think, um, I think they're helpful guidelines. I think you you need to understand the math behind the guidelines. So Fidelity's guidelines, for example, and I'm not as familiar with T-Ro's, but Fidelity's, um, which tap out at, um, you want 10 times your current income at the time that you retire. Those guidelines were developed for people who make between $50,000 a year and $300,000 a year.
01:13
Speaker B
And essentially, if you can get to that point, it will replace 80% of your final pre-retirement income in retirement. And so if that is something that you're aiming toward, knowing that you hit that 10 times mark is a very easy benchmark to grab onto and something to aim for.
01:46
Speaker B
Now, I at at various points in my career have tweeted out those um, those benchmarks and and the internet has not been incredibly uh happy with me for doing so because people who are very far away from those benchmarks who look at them, um and get daunted.
02:13
Speaker B
They think there there is absolutely no way that I am ever going to hit that. But if you can get yourself to the point where you are putting away a consistent 15% of your income year in and year out for retirement, and that can include any matching dollars that you receive from from an employer, you actually should hit those numbers.
02:44
Speaker B
So, take a step back, think about your savings rate, think about if your savings rate is high enough and if it's not high enough, what you can do to bump it up in real time and know that you're you're heading in the right direction.
