Video Transcript
00:00
Speaker A
Lift shares soaring in today's trade, rising 13% on the day. The company announcing a partnership with Waymo, launching a robo taxi service in Nashville starting next year. Joining me now we've got David Risher, Lyft CEO. David, it is always great to see you on this show. So you announced this partnership, David with Waymo, autonomous rides in Nashville.
00:27
Speaker A
Great town, David, one of my favorites, but but why Nashville? And is that just the beginning, David?
00:33
David Risher
It is a great town. Hey Josh. Uh, it's super fun. Uh, you know, if you go to Nashville, you got to go to the O as well as to sort of live the uh, the whole uh uh, you know, bridal party life. But anyway, so no, look, super fun city but also a tech forward city. Uh and a city that we've had a presence in for a long time. This deal does two things uh for our partnership with Waymo. First, it provides demand, right?
00:57
David Risher
We've got millions of people every day who open up the Lyft app and increasingly they're looking for an autonomous solution, which is great. And then second, it provides something called fleet management, which is what keeps the cars charged and ready to go. And this is something we've been doing for a decade including in Nashville. So a lot of good reasons for it's also just as you say, a great city.
01:17
Speaker A
And let me ask you, David, what is going to sort of differentiate, what makes your partnership different than what Waymo has with your rival Uber?
01:24
David Risher
Yeah. So, I think it's two things and again, I'll go to the same framework. On the demand side, we have something called integrated uh marketplace, it's kind of an integrated marketplace demand function, which sounds technical, but here's what it means. It means that we're taking these two fleets, all of Lyft's human- driven fleets and all of Waymo's uh, you know, robot driven fleet and sort of putting them together in a very dynamic way. And without wanting to get too kind of technical on it, it means that rather than sort of thinking of these as two completely segregated things where if you're on one app, you can only get to one, if you're on the other app, you can only get to the other, um they're sort of dynamically integrated, you know, 24/7.
01:53
David Risher
So it should mean, you know, super fast pickup times for riders as well as high utilization. Which gets to the second point, fleet management. Fleet management sounds technical. Think of like what happens when you take an airplane. Okay, you get on the airplane, it's got to be ready to fly. It's got to be clean, it's got to be service, it's got to be fueled. Same with cars, right? They got to be ready to go. And we've had this fleet management um subdivision uh for years now called Flex Drive.
02:17
David Risher
And that's what they do. No other rideshare service has it. Ours is integrated deeply into lift. We already have about 15,000 cars on the Flex Drive program. A guy named John Parks runs it by the way, he's a green beret, he's freaking amazing at what he does. And what the goal is is to keep the cars always, always, always ready to drive. And we think we'll be able to do that better than anybody else.
02:35
Speaker A
Now you, David, you you have other AV partnerships too, right? You got another one with uh May Mobility in Atlanta. I know that's early days. Any line of sight you can you can offer there, David, of how that partnership is trending?
02:49
David Risher
I mean it's super early as you said, we're just sort of in an early pilot there right down in Atlanta. Um but great so far, absolutely great so far. People really like AVs. And this is not at all to say that drivers won't have a huge, huge future in front of them as well. But it's great to have a new product that people find safe, find reliable. You know, it knows the traffic laws, it follows the laws. Of course it's quiet and kind of private in the car. So these things are are things that people, I think are going to like for a long time and it's why we think that AVs are going to expand the market, you know, wherever we go.
03:13
David Risher
We're actually seeing that in all the markets where we operate and AV's operate is our markets are actually growing faster than they are elsewhere.
03:19
Speaker A
And so so with those AV partnerships, David, how are you defining success? You know, walk me through, what what are the criteria, what are the metrics you'd be watching?
03:27
David Risher
Yeah. So the first thing, frankly I'm going to be looking for over the long term is growth, right? We want this to be a new product that we can offer to as many writers as we possibly can. When you sort of click, you know, one down, we're trying to create something that hasn't been created yet and it's called a hybrid marketplace, right? There are going to be human drivers and there are going to be robot drivers. And I want you as a writer to feel like I've got all the choice I want and that no matter how I, you know, get a ride, the service level is always going to be super, super, super high. That's what we always aim for at lift.
03:52
David Risher
And then from sort of a financial side, of course it has to work economically, not just for us, but for our partners, for the waymo of the world. They've got to feel like it's a success for them. And again, a lot of that is going to come down to are the cars ready to drive and then is the utilization high. In other words, are people paying and are the cars, you know, moving around with with paying riders in it. So combination of great business metrics, but also great customer experience. Uh I think it's going to grow the market hugely.
04:13
Speaker A
Finally, David, you know, we're we're always looking for a line of sight into the consumer, you have that. I I'm just curious, the consumer, you know, how healthy, how resilient does the consumer look, David, based on your business?
04:25
David Risher
Yeah, we see strength. We see strength. And, you know, I know I read the same headlines we all do and everyone's looking for maybe areas of weakness, but if I look across, I look at commute is still as incredibly strong. In fact, it continues to grow. I think return to office frankly continues to be a bit of a tailwin for us uh in a lot of parts of the country. Um, but even leisure travel, you know, people going out for drinks or people taking um, you know, airline trips whether that's for business or for pleasure.
04:41
David Risher
Honestly, we see strength across the board. Doesn't mean things can't change, but at least from what we can tell, consumers are pretty happy.
04:47
Speaker A
you know, David, we did, I'll squeeze one last in one in here. We did hear from the Fed today. There is some concern about a cooling labor market. When that happens, David, does that impact supply of Lyft drivers? Do you see more folks look looking to come to you, looking to earn extra income?
05:01
David Risher
It's a great question. And the answer is historically we have. Yeah, driver supply now is as high as it's ever been. And if I can brag for just a second, we have a 29 point advantage in driver preference over driving for the other guys. In other words, people who drive on both when they talk to us, they say we like you 29 points better than the other guy. So, you know, anyone looking for, you know, a good way to to bridge a gap or to or to come in and make extra money. I highly recommend driving on the lift platform, as you know, I do it too.
05:22
David Risher
But yeah, over time, what tends to happen is when the market maybe gets a little softer, it's a really easy way, 24 hours from now if you've got a car and a good driving record or a safe driver and so forth, you can be driving on the platform. and it's a really important bridge for a lot of people as well as a supplement, uh, if things get tough.
05:37
Speaker A
David, always great to see you. Thank you, sir.
05:40
David Risher
Thank you, Josh. Been a pleasure.
