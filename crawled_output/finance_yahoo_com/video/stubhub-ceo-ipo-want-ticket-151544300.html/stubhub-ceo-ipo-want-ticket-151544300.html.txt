Video Transcript
00:06
Speaker A
Online ticket platform StubHub is going public on the New York Stock Exchange today, set to trade under the ticker STUB after raising about $800 million. Joining me now is Eric Baker, StubHub CEO. Eric, thanks so much for joining us. You have had such an interesting journey here from StubHub at the beginning to it being acquired by eBay, then you went to Viagogo, then we saw them come together. Now, finally, the journey here coming to the IPO stage.
00:39
Speaker A
Um, so sort of I guess, what have you learned along that whole way? And why did you finally think today that now was the was the opportunity, you know, for the company to come public?
00:57
Speaker B
Sure. Well, Julie, thank you for having me. Um it has been quite a journey. We've been doing this for a long time. Started step hub originally back in 2000 to try and revolutionize the ticket resale market and give people an easy convenient way to buy and access tickets. And in sort of going through that process as you mentioned, uh bought StubHub back from eBay just a few years ago. And when we did that, we took on debt and so today's transaction is really about delevering. Uh let's just pay back that debt, um clean up our balance sheet.
01:36
Speaker B
And it's also just a great way for our businesses and move into the next phase uh to further raise our profile with partners, with consumers and to attract a great talent.
01:45
Speaker A
So what does that um path look like? That raising the profile. What are the goals here? You guys most of your business right now is in the US, is that about international expansion? Is it about types of events? How are you thinking through that?
02:00
Speaker B
Sure. So we have, we have a global business on one platform. Um as you say, the US is maybe, you know, 85% of that business. What we're really excited about Julie is, um, we have this vision that we call direct issuance, which is that we believe consumers don't care about primary or secondary tickets. They just want to get access to the tickets they want in an easy, convenient way. And so our opportunity is now to have all tickets flow over the platform. So it's easier for them to buy and we're already doing things like that with great partners like the New York Yankees in Major League Baseball.
02:30
Speaker A
Um they want easy tickets, but they also want a good value, right? And and I think that is where the real congestion and conflict has been in the ticketing industry as you well know, whether it's primary ticket uh ticket agents like Ticketmaster, whether it's secondary markets like StubHub, we've seen some legislators step in in Maine, for example, a recent piece of legislation said you couldn't sell tickets for more than 10% over face. How do you deal with those kinds of of obstacles?
03:13
Speaker B
Yeah, I think you're referring to something that um may have been one of the states, but the real the real focus Julie is people want to make it easier uh more transparent in pricing for people to get access to tickets to the first place. And a lot of that's broken with what's traditionally called the primary ticketing market. As you may know, uh oftentimes you have to get up at, you know, 2:00 in the morning, uh go to queue in a random place and hope that that someone has something accessible uh for you to buy.
03:42
Speaker B
And so, a lot of what we're trying to do through direct issuance is to open up that market and make different distribution outlets compete so that you make sure that the service that's providing the best experience for the customer is going to be the service that prevails. Um, and that's the world that we want, and we understand why fans and consumers want that as well.
04:03
Speaker A
But but do you have any concerns about potential, you know, policy changes, legislation changes that would cap the profit that you can take, the up the up charges on some of these secondary market tickets, leaving the direct selling aside for a moment.
04:19
Speaker B
Sure. Sure. No, we don't. Um, I think when you look at the legislation that's come through, the big thing has been all-in pricing, which is something the FTC passed in early May of this year, which we stuff hub lobbied for, um, which was to create greater pricing transparency and we want the best consumer experience. and we were very gratified because it was important to us by having a national policy from the FTC. It means, um, other competitors can't game that system. So that's been very positive. Um, you know, everything else really know, we're we're focused.
04:51
Speaker B
We we believe in uh free markets and providing the best uh services to consumers and see no reason why that won't continue.
05:01
Speaker A
Um Eric, talk to me about the path to profitability for the company. In the first six months of the year, you had a net loss of $76 million, revenue of almost $830 million. So, I know you have in addition to the fees that you charge, you've got ad uh revenue as well. So, how do you push towards getting profitable?
05:27
Speaker B
Sure. So I think the first thing to do is to understand um that we are a profitable company that generates cash. It's for the metric that we look at and Wall Street looks at is Ebitda, which is the earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. And so we generated a ton of cash flow which we've had to do because we we service debt. But I think to your question of all these different ways to expand and provide a better service and generate more cash flow. There's a ton of different um avenues that we have that we're excited about.
05:58
Speaker B
One is obviously as you mentioned an advertising business where we're going to have uh sponsored listings where many sellers just like they do on Amazon can sponsor their listings through our platform. And we've got partnerships in the works with a lot of value added partners through travel and gaming who in a positive way are trying to reach some of our consumers. So, you know, that in addition to as I said, uh touching on the direct issuance market, continue to expand internationally, so many more ways for us to continue expanding our cash flow and provide a better service.
06:23
Speaker A
All right, Eric, we're I've been looking at some of the concert uh stats for the year, what the biggest grossing concerts have been for example. Um, was looking at poll star data, Beyonce over the past few months, obviously, uh big grossing concert, you know, and we have seen um since the pandemic definitely a rebound in concerts overall. We got the weekend, we got Stray kids, which admittedly, I hadn't heard of but is a K-pop band, Coldplay, Post Malone, on that list. What what what have you been excited, what events have you been excited to go to this year?
07:05
Speaker B
Look, we we love all live events. as you said Julie, there's there's everything across the board from sports, to theater, to comedy, to music. A lot of great concert tours. hard to hard to pick one. I will say, you know, everyone's very excited about Ariana Grande. Uh her recently went on sale, she's such a talented performer. So, you know, but she's one among many. so no matter what your taste is, uh, you know, we've got you covered and we know people are still going to love going to concerts.
07:27
Speaker A
Well I'm curious about you just you what are you excited to go to?
07:33
Speaker B
Well, I am, you know, I love music. I'm also a massive sports fan. So I'll tell you, um I'm a big time, I'm from Los Angeles. So I love the Lakers, I love the Rams, um and I love the Dodgers. So while while again on the platform to your point, Julie, we everyone loves everything. I do have to admit I am rooting for hopefully a Dodger's back-to-back world series win and it would be great to see the Rams uh find a way to add another Super Bowl. So I I have to admit you got me. I am hoping for that.
08:05
Speaker A
All right, we'll see if that happens. We'll check back in. Thanks a lot, Eric, and again, congrats on the IPO.
