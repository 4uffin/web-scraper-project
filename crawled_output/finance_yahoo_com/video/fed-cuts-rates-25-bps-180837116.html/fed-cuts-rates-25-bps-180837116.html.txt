Fed cuts rates by 25 BPS, Miran pushed for 50 in dissent
Yahoo Finance Video
September 17, 2025
The Federal Reserve officials have opted to cut interest rates by 25 basis points — which falls in line with what Wall Street has been pricing in — at the central bank's September FOMC meeting on Wednesday. Fed Chair Jerome Powell will deliver remarks on the decision this afternoon. Yahoo Finance senior Fed correspondent Jennifer Schonberger reports more on this, the central bank's economic projections and plans for future rate cuts in 2025, and newly-appointed Fed Governor Stephen Miran's dissent in pushing for a 50 basis point cut. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination.
Video Transcript
00:00
Speaker A
25 basis point rate cut, the Federal Reserve lowering their benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point to a new range of 4 to 4 and a quarter percent and signaling two more rate cuts this year. The decision was not unanimous. Newly minted Fed Governor Stephen Myron dissented, preferring to cut by 50 basis points instead of 25.
00:26
Speaker A
As for the breakdown for rate projections this year, nine officials seeing three rate cuts in total this year, six officials seeing one cut, one saw no cut and one saw six cuts, presumably Stephen Myron there.
00:43
Speaker A
For next year, the median is for just one more rate cut. Now, these rate projections come as Fed officials upgraded their outlook for economic growth, but held their outlooks for both inflation and the unemployment rate. GDP now seen increasing to 1.6% versus the 1.4% projection back in June.
01:08
Speaker A
And they see the economy growing at 1.8% next year. Inflation expected to remain at 3.1% this year before coming back down to 2.6% next year. The unemployment rate seen at 4 and a half percent, which is the same estimate from back in June and falling a 10th of a percent next year to 4.4%.
01:31
Speaker A
Now, officials acknowledged the weakness that we've seen in the labor market in their policy statement saying that quote, job gains have slowed and that the unemployment rate has edged up but remains low. That was a downgrade from back in July when they had characterized the job market as quote, solid.
01:50
Speaker A
One other change, they said in considering additional adjustments to the target rate for the Fed funds rate, as opposed to the extent and timing of additional adjustments. The committee is carefully going to assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.
02:08
Speaker A
So guys, clearly the Fed here are concerned about weakness in the job market.
