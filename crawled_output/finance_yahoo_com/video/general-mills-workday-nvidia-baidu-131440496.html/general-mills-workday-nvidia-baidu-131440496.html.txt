OK, first up, we've got General Mills. Now you might be tucking into one of their cereals like Cheerios or Lucky Charms, but they've just reported earnings. And actually, the earnings beat consensus, and adjusted earnings per share came in at 86 cents. The markets were looking for 82 cents, and net sales actually came in at $4.52 billion which was in line with expectations, but that's had very little impact on the share price in pre-market.Down there a little bit there. Now for context, General Mills has been under pressure amid inflation pushing consumers to cheaper products and changing consumption patterns as people seek more healthy products. Pet food has been one bright spot for General Mills, and now we'll see how investors will react to these results which follow aggressive cost cuts and new product launches. One thing that that General Mills did say is that more people are choosing to eat at home.OK, now you need to know that Workday, the enterprise software is up more than 9% in pre-market. The company held an event for analysts yesterday and it announced some new plans, including snapping up the AI startup Sanna. The growth plans got a thumbs up uh from activist investor Elliott Management. OK, next up, a stock you want to watch closely, blockchain lender figure.The stock is up again, more than 3% in pre-market after it jumped 30% yesterday and gave up some gains to close about 8.4% higher, actually it's now up 4% in pre-market. Now, investors are loading their portfolios ahead of the Fed's decision today and figure is attracting optimism after what is widely seen as a successful IPO last week.In which it raised about $790 million. And while we're talking about this company will also bring you a headline about another tech company called Fi. This one is Fi AI which makes humanoid robots and is based in San Francisco. The startup is private, so harder to trade, but the news is that it has reached a $39 billion valuation after it raised over $1 billion in a Series C funding round that involved giant names including Intel Capital, Salesforce, Qualcomm and Nvidia.Well, speaking of Nvidia, we've been watching news today that the stock is coming under even more pressure from China. So let's take a look at some key AI stocks this morning that are moving on US China negotiations. But Nvidia, we're not seeing great giant swings, we can see that the stock is sliding again.Uh, maybe there might be some profit taking there as the FT reports that a Chinese government entity has instructed leading tech companies to stop purchasing and even to cancel existing orders of Nvidia's GPUs. This comes on top of more bad news for Nvidia this week in China, where it faces an antitrust probe.And as Beijing steps up its pressure on on Nvidia amid trade negotiations with the US, China's homegrown chip companies are gaining momentum. Look at Baidu, the Chinese tech giant is up about 16% in Hong Kong and its NASAQ listed shares are up more than 8% in pre-market. That's after its in-house chip making unit.Got an analyst upgrade. Meanwhile, Alibaba continues to gain ground, often dubbed China's Amazon. Alibaba is attracting new momentum with investors as it makes progress on its AI cloud expansion. It's up again more than 5% in Hong Kong today, and remember, this is one of the companies that have been asked to stop using Nvidia chips.
