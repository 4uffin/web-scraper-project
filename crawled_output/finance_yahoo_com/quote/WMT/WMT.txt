Raising 2026 GDP Forecast
We are raising our 2026 GDP estimate to 1.8% from 1.7%. The main change is that we expect lower interest rates to help housing and consumer durables in the second half of next year. Our full-year 2025 estimate is still 1.4%, but we made minor changes to our model. For the second half of 2025, we are reducing our estimates for both non-residential construction and housing. We are raising our estimates for intellectual property and information processing equipment based on investments in artificial intelligence. We are reducing our 3Q25 estimate to 1.8% from 2.2% and raising our 4Q estimate to 1.2% from 0.8%. We are trying to minimize some of the "uncertainty" in the economy by doing our forecast line by line as we would with a company earnings model. We would be remiss if we did not acknowledge slower hiring, six consecutive months of contraction in the important ISM manufacturing index, and six months of declining construction spending. But we believe that still-low unemployment, solid consumer spending, and strong corporate profits supporting stock prices will sustain the economy until lower interest rates and potentially bigger tax returns give the economy a boost. Based on the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia's Survey of Professional Forecasters, which was released on August 15, GDP is expected to grow 1.7% in 2025, 1.6% in 2026, and 2.1% in 2027. Indicators driven by a broad array of timely data point to 3Q growth. On September 4, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta's GDP Nowcast was estimating a 3Q GDP increase of 3.0, with PCE projected to grow 2.1%. The trade balance and inventories, which are notoriously difficult to forecast, are likely to normalize and be much smaller factors than they have been in recent months. On September 5, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's Staff Nowcast for 3Q called for 2.1% growth, with a 70% probability range of 0.46% to 3.81%. The 4Q Nowcast is projecting 2.28% growth. The Weekly Economic Index tracked by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas is also projecting growth over the next 12 months. Argus• 11 days ago
Argus Quick Note: Weekly Stock List for 09/08/2025: Companies Raising Guidance
During the recent earnings season, many companies across many sectors raised guidance. That is admirable, especially during uncertain economic times. We track the companies raising guidance and look for trends. Indeed, Management Signals is one of our Investment Themes for 2025. The sectors with the most companies raising guidance in the past quarter were Communication Services, Healthcare, Industrial, and Information Technology. Sectors underrepresented were Financial, Energy, and Consumer Staples. Raising guidance in the face of tariff and macroeconomic uncertainty could signal strong management, flexibility, and resilience. As well, increased guidance is often a catalyst for market-beating returns in the quarters ahead. The following is a partial list of companies in Argus' Fundamental Universe of Coverage at which management increased its outlook during the recent reporting season, with our rating and the sector designation noted. We like this theme, as it crosses numerous industries and generates a robust list of potential portfolio candidates. Argus• 13 days ago
