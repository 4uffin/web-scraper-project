On Wednesday, it was trillion-dollar titans Alphabet and Apple that led the indices.
On Wednesday, it was trillion-dollar titans Alphabet and Apple that led the indices. On Thursday, it was Amazon.com that jumped (by 4%) -- but this time, all the major and minor indices participated. The S&P 500 (SPX) and the S&P 100 (OEX) rose 0.8%, the Nasdaq and Nasdaq 100 popped almost 1%, and the S&P MidCap 400 and S&P SmallCap 600 tacked on 1.5%. Semiconductors, which look a bit iffy on the short-term charts, held near their recent lows and bounced 1.1%, closing right at the underside of the 50-day average. That is just another example of a key portion of the market bending but not breaking. And that is impressive considering how far the semis have rallied since their April bottom.
What has caught our attention in recent months in Information Technology is the power in many mid-cap and smaller large-cap names that do not get the same attention as the mega-cap names. Over the past three months, WDC has surged 67%, ANET 45%, TER 46%, STX 44%, GLW 38%, HPE 31%, TEL 29%, and SNPS 27%. Five of the eight stocks above have catapulted impressively to all-time highs. Some, if not all, of these issues may be considered secondary or tertiary AI trades. Sometimes it pays to dig deeper to uncover stocks that are not often discussed. These companies have market caps between $30 billion and $173 billion.
It's possible that the SPX and OEX are about to emerge from a somewhat rare formation known as a rising consolidation. These bullish patterns typically are seen after strong multi-month rallies and when many (like us) are looking for a technical pullback. The recent pause was tight, with a minor slope to the upside.

Argus Quick Note: Weekly Stock List for 08/18/2025: 13Fs Show Big Guns Buying Big Tech
Large institutional investors are buying tech companies. The stock market volatility during 2Q gave institutional investors a chance to buy dips and pick up some tech names at better prices. Taking a look at 13F filings of well-known institutional portfolios, we see that the big guns were busy picking up some new companies and/or adding to existing positions. Buying was across a variety of sectors, but tech names stand out. Vickers Stock Research, a subsidiary of Argus Research Group, analyzes insider trading and institutional stock ownership. Form 13-Fs, which institutions must file to report their holdings, are due 45 days after the end of calendar quarters and have come in for 2Q25. We review 13Fs of major institutional investors, including activists, to see what they are buying and to look for trends. Based on data from Vickers, here are select purchases made in 2Q by some high-profile money managers. The ratings listed are from Argus Research. Argus• last month
Amazon Earnings: Good Results, With AWS Still a Winner; Fear on Profitability Guidance Is Overblown

International segments constitute 25% to 30% of Amazon's non-AWS sales, led by Germany, the United Kingdom, and Japan.

For multiple weeks, we have been detailing very cautious insider-sentiment
For multiple weeks, we have been detailing very cautious insider-sentiment signals from Vickers Stock Research. It seems clear that insiders felt that stock prices (at all-time highs) were vulnerable to renewed volatility based on newsflow that includes earnings reports, tariff confusion, interest-rate drama, and (now) concerns about the employment situation. With the VIX popping 22% last Friday and then falling 13% on Monday, we'll say they got the volatility part right. Meanwhile, the S&P 500% hasn't done much over the past month and is off about 1% in the past week -- not a great performance report. Vickers broadest measure of insider sentiment, the Total Eight-Week Sell/Buy Ratio, has fallen for eight consecutive weeks and is near an outright bearish reading. On an exchange basis, the NYSE eight-week ratio has fallen for 11 weeks and is already bearish, while the Nasdaq ratio has plateaued after eight weeks of deterioration and has managed (just barely) to stay neutral. Insider buying drove activity in the Energy sector over the past week, with shares valued at $1.2 million bought versus none sold. It was the only sector in which buying outpaced selling. Still, buying activity just barely lagged selling in Consumer Discretionary. Meanwhile, the greatest level of selling occurred in the Financial sector, with shares valued at $105 million sold versus $5 million bought. Selling activity was also of note in Industrials ($85 million sold versus $1.5 million bought), and in Information Technology ($34 million sold versus nothing bought).
This week, analysts at Vickers highlighted insider transactions of interest at Medpace Holdings Inc. (NGS: MEDP) and Charles Schwab Corp. (NYSE: SCHW). Argus• last month
