Home Depot Capitalizes on Pro Growth Efforts, Expanding Its Leadership Position in Home
Home Depot is the world's largest home improvement specialty retailer, operating 2,353 warehouse-format stores offering more than 30,000 products in store and 1 million products online in the US, Canada, and Mexico. Its stores offer building materials, home improvement products, lawn and garden products, and decor products and provide various services, including home improvement installation services and tool and equipment rentals. The acquisition of Interline Brands in 2015 allowed Home Depot to enter the MRO business, which has been expanded through the tie-up with HD Supply (2020). The 2024 tie-up with SRS will help grow professional demand in roofing, pool, and landscaping projects, while the pending acquisition of GMS will lift building product sales.

At midday Wednesday, the major benchmarks were mostly lower, with the Nasdaq
At midday Wednesday, the major benchmarks were mostly lower, with the Nasdaq Composite, the market's recent winner, down by far the most. Investors will parse potentially market-moving news in the form of minutes from the Fed's July open market committee meeting at 2pm that will show member thinking on future interest rates. That will be followed by highly anticipated comments from Fed Chairman Powell on Thursday. Retailers have moved into the thick of their earnings season, offering insight into the state of the U.S. consumer, with today's crop of reporting companies showing mixed consumer behavior.
