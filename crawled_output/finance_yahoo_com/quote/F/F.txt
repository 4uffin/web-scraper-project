Stocks are higher at Monday midday. The dot plot thickens (pun intended). The odds of a Fed rate cut in September are now 85%, a big reversal from Friday morning before the release of the Jobs report. That data has economists rethinking the strength of the labor market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note is 4.22%, a big drop from last week. Crude oil is at $66 per barrel. Argus• last month
