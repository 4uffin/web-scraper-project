On Wednesday, the stock market continued its rally off the minor lows from August 21, with leadership again coming from the small- and mid-caps.
On Wednesday, the stock market continued its rally off the minor lows from August 21, with leadership again coming from the small- and mid-caps. The S&P 500 rose 0.2% and closed at a minor all-time high (ATH). The S&P 100, Nasdaq, and Nasdaq 100 all saw similar gains. The S&P MidCap 400 (MDY) was up 0.6% to its second-highest level in 2025. The MDY has completed a very large inverse head-and-shoulders formation and is only 4% from its November 2024 ATH. The S&P Small Cap 600 popped 0.8% and has rallied 4% in the past four days, spurred by Fed Chairman Powell's dovish comments in Jackson Hole last Friday.
Nvidia (NVDA) posted quarterly results after the close on Wednesday. The stock saw a muted response, with a setback of about 1.5% in the premarket. Since NVDA's April closing low, the stock has skyrocketed 93% and has rallied 35% in 2025. Technically, price reached peak momentum in mid-July on the daily chart, with the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) reaching extreme overbought territory of 80%. Since the peak, there have been multiple bearish divergences with respect to the 14-day RSI and the daily moving-average convergence/divergence (MACD).
With a $4.4 trillion market capitalization, Nvidia makes up 10% of the Nasdaq 100, 8% of the S&P 500, and 22% of the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH). Strangely, it makes up only 8.8% of the iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) and is second to AMD (with a 9.8% weighting). As we have suggested in the past, always check ETF weightings before hitting the buy button, as making assumptions in that area can lead to costly mistakes. (Mark Arbeter, CMT)

Stocks rebounded yet again on Wednesday as the bulls and bears continue to take shots at each other.
Stocks rebounded yet again on Wednesday as the bulls and bears continue to take shots at each other. The S&P 500 rose 0.7%, the S&P 100 added 1%, the Nasdaq tacked on 1.2%, and the Nasdaq 100 was up 1.3%. The market benefited (greatly) from the mega caps in the trillion-dollar club, with AAPL popping 5%, AMZN ripping 4%, TSLA adding 3.6%, and AVGO tacking on 3%. When the "big guns" pop like that, it doesn't matter what the rest of the stock universe does.
On a sector level, Wednesday was a mixed day. Consumer Discretionary led with a 2.1% gain thanks to TSLA. Consumer Staples and Information Technology also had a good day. Poor old Healthcare was in the dumps again, falling 1.5%, with 0.8% to 1.1% losses in Materials, Energy, Utilities, and Real Estate. Many utility stocks have been on fire lately, as the sector continues to transfer from your father's stodgy old dividend stocks to something like growth stocks.
The S&P 500 and the S&P 100 have both stopped right at the key 61.8% retracement of the recent decline. When zeroing in on a one-hour chart, both indices appear to be working on three-wave, ABC advances since the August 1 intraday lows. The Nasdaq and QQQ have retraced a bit more than 61.8%. A three-wave rally would be considered a counter-trend move and would suggest another leg lower is in the cards. A reasonable S&P 500 target, if that plays out, would be 6,100.
Breadth has petered out since July 1, with the percentage of S&P 500 stocks above their 50-day average falling to 51% from 81% and the percentage above their 20-day falling to 43% from 82%. The percentage above their 200-day peaked at 68% on July 23, and has dropped to 57%. (Mark Arbeter, CMT)

Not a Beach Week
Hustle back from the beach, it's an action-packed week.
Not a Beach Week Hustle back from the beach, it's an action-packed week. The Fed meets, the jobs report is out, as is a key inflation report, and four more Mag7 companies report earnings. Last week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500, and the Nasdaq all gained about 1%. So far this year, the Dow is up 5%, the S&P 500 has climbed 8%, and the Nasdaq leads with a gain of 9%.
Earnings season is at peak volume, with more than 900 public companies reporting this week. The list includes Visa, Procter & Gamble, Merck, Booking Holdings, Boeing, Spotify, Starbucks, and UPS on Tuesday; Microsoft and Meta Platforms on Wednesday; Apple, Amazon, MasterCard, and Anheuser-Busch on Thursday; and Exxon Mobil, Chevron, and Colgate-Palmolive on Friday. At this point, 30% of S&P 500 companies have reported, with 8% growth in corporate earnings compared to the year-ago quarter. This is a solid but slower pace than in the past few quarters. The first quarter logged earnings growth of 14%, following 17% growth in 4Q24, and 9% growth in 3Q24, according to LSEG. For the current quarter, Communication Services is leading, up 37%, while Energy, down 23%, is at the bottom. This week's economic calendar is also jammed. The FOMC will announce its next interest-rate decision on Wednesday afternoon. No change is expected. Wall Street, as usual, will focus on the comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Other releases include consumer confidence and job openings on Tuesday; GDP on Wednesday; the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Index on Thursday; and the important July jobs report on Friday.
Meanwhile, the Atlanta Fed GDPNow measure currently forecasts 2.4% for 2Q, following a decline of 0.5% for 1Q. The Cleveland Fed Inflation Nowcast forecasts a 2.7% rate for CPI in July, even with the June pace. Mortgage rates stayed flat last week, with the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at 6.74%, according to FreddieMac. Gas prices dropped a penny to an average of $3.12 per gallon for regular gas.
After this week's Federal Reserve rate decision, the next meeting is on September 17, with odds at 64% for a cut, according to the CME FedWatch rate tool. After that, the central bank meets on October 29 and odds jump to 80% for a cut. Most economists still expect two rate cuts in 2025. Taking a deeper dive into performance, U.S. stocks are lagging global stocks. A leading industrialized global stock market index, the EFA ETF, has surged 19% year to date, while the leading emerging market ETF EEM has gained 18%. U.S. growth stocks, with a year-to-date gain of 9% (ETF ticker IWF), have taken the lead over value stocks, which show an advance of 7% based on the value ETF (IWD). In other asset classes for the year to date, AGG bonds are up 1.3%, gold is up 28%, crude oil is down 7%, and Bitcoin is up 24%. The U.S. dollar is down 10%, tracking DXY. The VIX Volatility Index is at 15, below its historical average of 20 and consistent with a bull market. Sector performance reveals a mixed picture halfway through 2025. The Industrial sector leads with a 17% gain, followed by Information Technology, Communication Services, and Utilities (all up about 12%). Financials (+10%) also is outperforming the broader market. Turning to defensive sectors, Consumer Staples is up 4% and Materials 10%. Consumer Discretionary and Healthcare are around flat-line for the year, while Real Estate (+6%) has turned a bit higher, but continues to struggle amid elevated interest rates.
