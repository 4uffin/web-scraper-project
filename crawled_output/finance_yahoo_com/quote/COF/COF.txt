The stock market paused on Tuesday ahead of the FOMC's decision on interest rates at 2:00 p.m.
The stock market paused on Tuesday ahead of the FOMC's decision on interest rates at 2:00 p.m. today. It's also possible that the major indices were taking a breather after a pretty nice run over the nine days ending September 15. The S&P 500 (SPX) has gained 3.1% in that period, the S&P 100 has popped 4%, the Invesco S&P 500 Top 50 (XLG) and the Nasdaq have ripped higher by about 5%, and the Nasdaq 100 has gained 4.6%.
While a 25-basis-point cut in the fed funds rate seems to be a lock, investor opinions about additional rate cuts going into the end of 2025 and into 2026 are all over the place. That could be why the options market has witnessed a decent move higher in premiums over the past two days. The volatility index (VIX) jumped 6% on Monday and tacked on another 4.3% on Tuesday. While a two-day advance of almost 11% for the VIX is common, it almost always happens during quick price declines in the S&P 500. Indeed, every 10%-20% pop in the VIX over a two-day period during the past year has been due to a fast drop in the SPX. But not this time, as investors are gobbling up options and pushing up premiums to hedge against either a "sell the news" event or for protection if Chairman Powell unleashes a hawkish press conference following the fed funds announcement.
We don't have historical data, but total VIX call and put volume for the September 17 expiration was a huge 463,000 contracts and total VIX option volume for all expirations was massive at 1.8 million. That's almost a 100% jump in volume based on a monthly average. (Mark Arbeter, CMT) Argus• 7 days ago
Argus Quick Note: Weekly Stock List for 08/25/2025: Innovators in the Financial Sector
The Financial sector is active, with new business models, a heavy embrace of AI, small companies entering with innovative niches, and established players reworking divisions to be more competitive. It includes many companies that offer growth and value and that we believe should be included in diversified portfolios. Currently, we have an Over-Weight rating on the sector, which has great depth at about 14% of the S&P 500. At that size, there is a large pool of stocks from which to choose. The current landscape of the sector includes new fintech companies, many with profitability models prioritizing fees overs basis-point spreads. Many are focused on growth as opposed to balance sheets and dividends. Innovators include companies coming up with new payment-processing platforms, new insurance services, new ways to bank and complete financial transactions, and new ways to leverage AI. At a quick glance, the industry is using AI for financial planning, underwriting, trading, and fraud protection. In trading, AI algorithms analyze large sums of data and historical trends in order to recognize patterns and movements in the financial markets. The following is a list of BUY-rated Financial sector stocks that we consider to be innovators. We also note which are included in Argus theme model portfolios. Argus• 30 days ago
The stock market remains in pullback mode.
The stock market remains in pullback mode. For a second straight day on Wednesday, mega-cap Information Technology dragged the major indices lower. The Technology Sector SPDR (XLK) dropped 0.7% and has given back 3% since its closing all-time high on August 13 (five trading days ago). But that's not the entire story, as there have been some massive declines in many IT names. Still, let's keep this in perspective, as the losses are coming after huge upside advances.
One of the most-loved names in IT and AI is PLTR, which has dropped 16.6% in six days after an epic run from around $20 in mid-2024 to $187 on August 12 (and with an incredible 150% run from its closing low in April, just over four months ago). CRWV is another example and a recent IPO. The stock exploded from the $40 region in late March to $184 on June 20. Since then, the stock has dropped back to $92. Parabolic advances don't end well and there are a fair number of charts that are starting to resemble Christmas trees.
On Wednesday, IT was led lower by the computer hardware industry, with $3.4 trillion AAPL declining 2% and the smaller DELL falling 5%. The semiconductor ETFs (SOXX and SMH), which led Tuesday's drop, fell just under their respective 50-day averages and bounced pretty hard. Neither of these important ETFs have broken down or formed topping patterns, and the bounce off their 50-day lines was logical. Much depends on the semiconductor stocks, as they make up a good portion of market cap in the major indices. And let's not forget, NVDA (the "King of Chips") reports quarterly numbers next Wednesday.

The major indices opened with nice gains on Thursday, reflecting strength in META and MSFT after positive earnings reports.
The major indices opened with nice gains on Thursday, reflecting strength in META and MSFT after positive earnings reports. But, unfortunately, the open represented the high of the day, as investors sold strength. The S&P 500's range was 88 points from high to close, which is certainly an uptick in volatility. The majors traced out bearish engulfing candlesticks, which can sometimes represent an intermediate-term top. While we have been looking for an uptick in volatility as well as lower equity prices, some downside follow-through is needed to confirm if a "pullback" in stocks may be underway.
Meta Platforms (META) finished the day with a whopping 11% gain, while Microsoft (MSFT) rose 4%, finishing well off its opening high. But after reporting Thursday following the close, Amazon.com (AMZN) was down 8% while Apple (AAPL) was up only 1.5%. So the reaction to those results was more tempered than the moves we saw Wednesday night.
While we won't make the assumption that something drastic is happening, we do note that, eventually, there will be winners and losers in the race for superiority in the world of artificial intelligence. But for now, the kings have been crowned. For the foreseeable future, that may mean that some of the largest companies in the world, with stocks that are followed by the masses, can be mispriced as we go move down in market cap. And that should not be taken lightly. (Mark Arbeter, CMT) Argus• last month
