Insider-sentiment data from Vickers Stock Research shows that executives,
Insider-sentiment data from Vickers Stock Research shows that executives, directors, and beneficial owners are still not feeling the love when it comes to the stock market at all-time highs. But the one-week data from Vickers is now on a different trajectory than the eight-week data, which could lead to a less-worrisome outlook. After multiple weeks of very bearish one-week sentiment data, the eight-week sentiment readings have been pushed either into or just to the brink of bearish. Yet those same one-week readings have now started to calm. On a scale where any reading above 6.00 is bearish and any reading between 2.00 and 6.00 is neutral, Vickers' Total One-Week Sell/Buy Ratio is now 4.99 -- much improved from the 14.78 ratio logged back on July 14. It has been a volatile few weeks in the stock market and that volatility has been reflected in insider data as well. Right now, the path seems to point towards neutral sentiment. But any thought of bullish insider sentiment is off the table at this time. Insider selling outpaced insider buying across all sectors over the past week. The greatest level of selling occurred in the Financial sector, with shares valued at $173 million sold by insiders versus $6 million bought. Selling activity was also of note in the Industrial sector, with shares valued at $91 million sold versus $3 million bought, as well as in Healthcare and Technology.
This week, analysts at Vickers highlighted insider transactions of interest at Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NGS: VRTX) and Blackstone Inc. (NYSE: BX). Argus• last month
