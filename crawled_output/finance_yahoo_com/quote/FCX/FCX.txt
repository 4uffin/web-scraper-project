For multiple weeks, we have been detailing very cautious insider-sentiment
For multiple weeks, we have been detailing very cautious insider-sentiment signals from Vickers Stock Research. It seems clear that insiders felt that stock prices (at all-time highs) were vulnerable to renewed volatility based on newsflow that includes earnings reports, tariff confusion, interest-rate drama, and (now) concerns about the employment situation. With the VIX popping 22% last Friday and then falling 13% on Monday, we'll say they got the volatility part right. Meanwhile, the S&P 500% hasn't done much over the past month and is off about 1% in the past week -- not a great performance report. Vickers broadest measure of insider sentiment, the Total Eight-Week Sell/Buy Ratio, has fallen for eight consecutive weeks and is near an outright bearish reading. On an exchange basis, the NYSE eight-week ratio has fallen for 11 weeks and is already bearish, while the Nasdaq ratio has plateaued after eight weeks of deterioration and has managed (just barely) to stay neutral. Insider buying drove activity in the Energy sector over the past week, with shares valued at $1.2 million bought versus none sold. It was the only sector in which buying outpaced selling. Still, buying activity just barely lagged selling in Consumer Discretionary. Meanwhile, the greatest level of selling occurred in the Financial sector, with shares valued at $105 million sold versus $5 million bought. Selling activity was also of note in Industrials ($85 million sold versus $1.5 million bought), and in Information Technology ($34 million sold versus nothing bought).
This week, analysts at Vickers highlighted insider transactions of interest at Medpace Holdings Inc. (NGS: MEDP) and Charles Schwab Corp. (NYSE: SCHW).

Freeport-McMoRan Earnings: Increased Volumes and Higher Gold Prices Drive a Strong Result
Freeport-McMoRan owns stakes in 10 copper mines, led by its 49% ownership of the Grasberg copper and gold operations in Indonesia, 55% of the Cerro Verde mine in Peru, and 72% of Morenci in Arizona. It sold around 1.2 million metric tons of copper (its share) in 2024, making it the one of the world’s largest copper miners by volume. It also sold about 900,000 ounces of gold, mostly from Grasberg, and 70 million pounds of molybdenum. It had about 25 years of copper reserves at the end of December 2024. We expect it to sell similar amounts of copper midcycle in 2029, though we expect gold volumes to decline to about 650,000 ounces then due to falling production at Grasberg.

Many clients of Argus Research are long-term buy-and-hold investors. As such, our proprietary BUY-HOLD-SELL ratings and target prices are established with one-year time horizons. We also have five-year ratings for even longer-term investors and pension funds. But we also have hedge fund clients that are looking for trading opportunities or for long/short portfolio ideas. The first few months of 2025, with roller-coaster ups and downs in stock prices, likely provided more opportunities for momentum traders than for fundamental investors. The list below includes some of the shorter-term trading ideas our analysts and strategists have identified recently. All the stocks listed below are rated BUY at Argus.
