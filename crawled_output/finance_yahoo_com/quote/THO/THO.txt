Thor Earnings: Fiscal 2025 Ends With Good Results, Ambivalent Tone Set for Fiscal 2026
Based in Elkhart, Indiana, Thor Industries manufactures Class A, Class B, and Class C motor homes along with travel trailers and fifth-wheel towables across about 35 brands. Through the acquisition of Erwin Hymer in 2019, the company expanded its geographic footprint and now produces various motorized and towable recreational vehicles for Europe, including motor caravans, camper vans, urban vehicles, caravans, and other RV-related products and services. The company has also begun generating revenue through aftermarket component parts via the acquisition of Airxcel in 2021; however, this is still a nascent part of the business as it accounts for less than 10% of total sales. In fiscal 2024, the company wholesaled 186,908 units and generated over $10 billion in revenue.

Morningstar• yesterday
2025 guidance reaffirmed; still too early for an upgrade
Thor is the world's largest manufacturer of recreational vehicles, with leading positions in Motorized and Towable RVs (travel trailers and fifth wheels). The company has been profitable every year since its inception in 1980. Thor manufactures a wide variety of RVs in the U.S. and Europe and sells those vehicles and parts to independent, non-franchise dealers throughout the U.S., Canada, and Europe. The common shares are currently a component of the S&P MidCap 400 index and Thor has approximately 22,300 employees. Rating

The major stocks indices are higher at midday on Friday, riding a jobs report
The major stocks indices are higher at midday on Friday, riding a jobs report this morning that matched the Argus estimate while beating the overall Street consensus. For now, it appears that hiring is still happening even with the headwind of tariff uncertainty. As well, a reported calming in the war of words between President Trump and Elon Musk reassured those who saw that brouhaha as having a possible significant negative impact on current events.
