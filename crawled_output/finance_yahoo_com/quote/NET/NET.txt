Argus Quick Note: Weekly Stock List for 09/08/2025: Companies Raising Guidance
During the recent earnings season, many companies across many sectors raised guidance. That is admirable, especially during uncertain economic times. We track the companies raising guidance and look for trends. Indeed, Management Signals is one of our Investment Themes for 2025. The sectors with the most companies raising guidance in the past quarter were Communication Services, Healthcare, Industrial, and Information Technology. Sectors underrepresented were Financial, Energy, and Consumer Staples. Raising guidance in the face of tariff and macroeconomic uncertainty could signal strong management, flexibility, and resilience. As well, increased guidance is often a catalyst for market-beating returns in the quarters ahead. The following is a partial list of companies in Argus' Fundamental Universe of Coverage at which management increased its outlook during the recent reporting season, with our rating and the sector designation noted. We like this theme, as it crosses numerous industries and generates a robust list of potential portfolio candidates. Argus• 16 days ago
For multiple weeks, we have been detailing very cautious insider-sentiment
For multiple weeks, we have been detailing very cautious insider-sentiment signals from Vickers Stock Research. It seems clear that insiders felt that stock prices (at all-time highs) were vulnerable to renewed volatility based on newsflow that includes earnings reports, tariff confusion, interest-rate drama, and (now) concerns about the employment situation. With the VIX popping 22% last Friday and then falling 13% on Monday, we'll say they got the volatility part right. Meanwhile, the S&P 500% hasn't done much over the past month and is off about 1% in the past week -- not a great performance report. Vickers broadest measure of insider sentiment, the Total Eight-Week Sell/Buy Ratio, has fallen for eight consecutive weeks and is near an outright bearish reading. On an exchange basis, the NYSE eight-week ratio has fallen for 11 weeks and is already bearish, while the Nasdaq ratio has plateaued after eight weeks of deterioration and has managed (just barely) to stay neutral. Insider buying drove activity in the Energy sector over the past week, with shares valued at $1.2 million bought versus none sold. It was the only sector in which buying outpaced selling. Still, buying activity just barely lagged selling in Consumer Discretionary. Meanwhile, the greatest level of selling occurred in the Financial sector, with shares valued at $105 million sold versus $5 million bought. Selling activity was also of note in Industrials ($85 million sold versus $1.5 million bought), and in Information Technology ($34 million sold versus nothing bought).
This week, analysts at Vickers highlighted insider transactions of interest at Medpace Holdings Inc. (NGS: MEDP) and Charles Schwab Corp. (NYSE: SCHW). Argus• last month
