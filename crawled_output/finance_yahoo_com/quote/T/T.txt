The FOMC cut the fed funds rate by an expected 25 basis points (bps), bringing the target rate down to 4.00% to 4.25%.
The FOMC cut the fed funds rate by an expected 25 basis points (bps), bringing the target rate down to 4.00% to 4.25%. It was the first action by the Fed since it cut rates at the end of 2024. Chairman Powell indicated that two more 25 bps cuts could be made by the end of the year. He suggested that Wednesday's move was a "risk management cut," and added that a very different picture of risks has emerged as the labor market has started to cool.
The CME FedWatch Tool is showing an 88% probability of a 25-bps cut at the October 29 meeting and an 81% chance of another 25-bps cut at the December 10 meeting.
The 10-year Treasury yield dropped about five bps to 4% right after the Fed cut, but reversed higher, finishing at 4.08%. Both the five-year and the two-year also fell about five bps following the cut, but ended higher on the day. The 10-year has fallen from an intraday high of 4.63% on May 22 to an intraday low of 4% on Wednesday; the five-year has dropped from 4.17% to 3.53% during a similar time period; and the two-year has declined from 4.1% on 5/14 to a low of 3.47% on 9/5. Yields across the curve have cycled into oversold territory on a daily basis and -- at least in the short-term -- we may see some upward pressure as yields are stretched to the downside.
On Wednesday, investors took more profits in the two largest semiconductor names, with NVDA losing 2.6% and AVGO shedding 3.8%. Once again, the NVDA chart is looking suspect in the short term and appears to be rolling over. A break of the recent closing low of $167 could open the door for a drop to strong support in the $145-$150 area. (Mark Arbeter, CMT) Argus• 7 days ago
AT&T: EchoStar Spectrum Purchase Comes at High Cost but Provides Strategic Benefits
The wireless business contributes nearly 70% of AT&T’s revenue. The company is the third-largest US wireless carrier, connecting 73 million postpaid and 17 million prepaid phone customers. Fixed-line enterprise services, which account for about 14% of revenue, include internet access, private networking, security, voice, and wholesale network capacity. Residential fixed-line services, about 12% of revenue, primarily consist of broadband internet access, serving 14 million customers. AT&T also has a sizable presence in Mexico, with 24 million customers, but this business only accounts for 3% of revenue. The company recently sold its 70% equity stake in satellite television provider DirecTV to its partner, private equity firm TPG.

Stocks continued to march higher last week, with the major indices remaining in tight, bullish channels.
Stocks continued to march higher last week, with the major indices remaining in tight, bullish channels. The S&P 500 (SPX) and S&P 100 (OEX) rose 1%, while the Nasdaq was up 0.8% and the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) lagged with a 0.4% gain. The big winner of the week were the small-caps, with the S&P Small Cap 600 jumping 3.2% and the S&P Mid Cap 400 tacking on 1.6%.
Healthcare was up 4.7% last week but remains in last place year to date among the SPX sectors. Communication Services rose 3.6%, Discretionary was up 2.4%, Materials gained 2%, and Financials rallied just over 1%. Utilities and Staples were at the bottom, with 0.7% and 0.6% losses, respectively.
For the major indices, the bearish divergences continue to add up. The daily SPX chart is working on its third negative moving-average convergence/divergence (MACD), while there has been one 14-day relative strength index (RSI) divergence following an extremely overbought condition. The same can be said for the OEX and QQQ. The daily Vortex indicator is close to giving a sell signal on the major three indices and the 21-day rate-of-change (ROC) isn't far from bearish territory.
The McClellan Oscillator, a breadth indicator (derived by taking the number of advancing issues minus the number of declining issues, and subtracting the 39-day exponential averages of net advances from the 19-day exponential) can signal breadth thrusts, centerline crossovers, and divergences. The reading is painting a bearish picture for the major indices. We now have two bearish divergences with respect to the SPX, OEX, and the QQQ. Non-confirmations with respect to breadth generally are seen prior to pullbacks and corrections. (Mark Arbeter, CMT) Argus• last month
