As stocks continue to move higher (newly buoyed by interest rates that are
As stocks continue to move higher (newly buoyed by interest rates that are officially on a downward trek), insiders continue to let off steam in what is arguably an increasingly toppy stock market. Still, with favorable seasonality in play through the end of 2025, it remains to be seem how much 'toppier' stocks can/will get.
The caution from insiders is in the higher end of the neutral range and, therefore, near the low end of the bearish range. On a scale where neutral sentiment runs from 2.00 to 6.00 and then bearish sentiment kicks in, the Total Eight-Week Sell/Buy Ratio from Vickers Stock Research (Vickers' broadest sell/buy measurement) is now 5.02. But it also has fallen into a very tight channel, as the ratio was 5.04 three weeks ago, 4.97 two weeks ago, and 4.90 last week. On a near-term basis and broken down by exchange, the highest degree of caution is coming from executives at companies that trade on the NYSE, as that exchange is currently posting a one-week ratio of 9.93. Relatively better is the one-week ratio for the Nasdaq, currently at 6.24. With the one-week readings running hotter than the eight-week results, a move into broad bearish sentiment is increasingly likely. End of day, insider sentiment is cautious and getting more cautious -- but not worthy of a 'run for the exits' response. This week, analysts at Vickers highlighted insider transactions of interest at Streamex Corp. (NCM: STEX) and Energy Vault Holdings Inc. (NYSE: NRGV). Argus• 2 days ago
On Wednesday, technology heavyweights Alphabet and Apple soared 9% and 3.6%, respectively.
On Wednesday, technology heavyweights Alphabet and Apple soared 9% and 3.6%, respectively. In keeping with that, the Nasdaq gained 1%, the Nasdaq 100 and S&P 100 added 0.8%, the Invesco S&P 500 Top 50 ETF (XLG) rose 0.9%, and the S&P 500 added 0.5%. The rest of the stock indices were mostly flat to lower. The Information Technology sector (XLK) rose 0.5% as weakness in electrical components and equipment as well as semiconductors counteracted the AAPL gain, while Communication Services (XLC) popped 1.6% to an all-time high on GOOGL's strength. The lack of gains in the overall market was disappointing, given the move in two of the members in the stock market's trillion-dollar market-cap club.
The all-important semiconductor industry is looking a bit toppy from a short- to intermediate-term perspective. The iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) gave up 0.5% on Wednesday -- and in the 12 days ending September 2, there have been four distribution days. The 14-day relative strength index (RSI) has traced out multiple divergences since momentum peaked back in early July and has crossed into bearish territory below 50%. The daily moving-average convergence/divergence (MACD) is about to cross into bearish territory, the 21-day rate-of-change (ROC) is close to turning negative, the ETF is below its 50-day average, and there has been a bearish five-day/13-day exponential moving average (EMA) crossover for the first time since February. Yet despite all these bearish signals, the SOXX continues to hold tough.
NVDA has completed a small head-and-shoulders top -- and in the 10 days ending 9/3, has seen six distribution days. The stock is under its 50-day, sports a bearish five-/13-day EMA crossover, the 21-day ROC is negative, and daily momentum is bearish. (Mark Arbeter, CMT) Argus• 21 days ago
