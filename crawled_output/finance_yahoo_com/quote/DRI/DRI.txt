Darden's Smart Marketing and Promotions Keep Consumers Engaged, Supporting Same-Store Sales Growth
Darden Restaurants is the largest restaurant operator in the US full-service space, with consolidated revenue of $12.1 billion in fiscal 2025.

Darden generates revenue almost exclusively from company-owned restaurants, though a small network of franchised restaurants and consumer-packaged goods sales contribute modestly through the traditional grocery channel.
