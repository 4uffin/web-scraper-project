Darden Restaurants: Value-Led Promotions Elevate Brand Demand, but Shares Remain Overvalued
Darden Restaurants is the largest restaurant operator in the US full-service space, with consolidated revenue of $12.1 billion in fiscal 2025. The company maintains a portfolio of 11 restaurant brands: Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse, Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen, Ruth's Chris, Yard House, The Capital Grille, Seasons 52, Eddie V’s, Bahama Breeze, The Capital Burger, and most recently, Chuy's. Darden generates revenue almost exclusively from company-owned restaurants, though a small network of franchised restaurants and consumer-packaged goods sales through the traditional grocery channel contribute modestly. As of the end of its fiscal 2025, the company operated 2,159 restaurants in the US.
