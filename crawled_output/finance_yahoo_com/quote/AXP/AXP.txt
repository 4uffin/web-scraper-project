The major indices posted small gains on Monday as investors braced for key inflation news and some important software earnings reports.
The major indices posted small gains on Monday as investors braced for key inflation news and some important software earnings reports. Not surprisingly, corporate insiders have hit the sell button recently. Can you blame them after the rally we've had since the April low? Insiders can sell for many reasons, and some (maybe many) of these individuals have a large percentage of their wealth tied up in their company's stock. However, when the sell/buy ratios get out of hand, we take notice.
In recent weeks, insider-sentiment data from Vickers Stock Research suggests corporate insiders are "not feeling the love" for stocks. This week, that caution has jumped, as all of the one-week sell/buy ratios from Vickers have turned bearish. Is this caution because many stocks are at/near all-time highs? Based on a resurgence of tariff confusion? Because of a potentially weakening employment situation?
Whatever the cause(s), the numbers are clear. On a scale where anything above 6.00 is bearish, Vickers' Total One-Week Sell/Buy Ratio is now 7.70 versus 4.56 last week and 3.52 a month ago. Breaking that down, the NYSE one-week ratio is a worrisome 9.88 versus 6.00 last week and 3.07 a month ago, and the Nasdaq one-week ratio is 6.79 versus 3.84 last week and 4.14 a month ago. If the trend is your friend, that trend is not friendly.
Insider buying outpaced selling in the Consumer Staples sector over the past week, while selling outpaced buying in all other sectors. The greatest level of selling was in Information Technology, as stocks valued at $63 million were sold versus just $65,452 bought. (Mark Arbeter, CMT) Argus• 16 days ago

Argus Quick Note: Weekly Stock List for 08/25/2025: Innovators in the Financial Sector
The Financial sector is active, with new business models, a heavy embrace of AI, small companies entering with innovative niches, and established players reworking divisions to be more competitive. It includes many companies that offer growth and value and that we believe should be included in diversified portfolios. Currently, we have an Over-Weight rating on the sector, which has great depth at about 14% of the S&P 500. At that size, there is a large pool of stocks from which to choose. The current landscape of the sector includes new fintech companies, many with profitability models prioritizing fees overs basis-point spreads. Many are focused on growth as opposed to balance sheets and dividends. Innovators include companies coming up with new payment-processing platforms, new insurance services, new ways to bank and complete financial transactions, and new ways to leverage AI. At a quick glance, the industry is using AI for financial planning, underwriting, trading, and fraud protection. In trading, AI algorithms analyze large sums of data and historical trends in order to recognize patterns and movements in the financial markets. The following is a list of BUY-rated Financial sector stocks that we consider to be innovators. We also note which are included in Argus theme model portfolios. Argus• last month
The crypto world has provided interesting investment opportunities of late, especially Ethereum (ETHE).
The crypto world has provided interesting investment opportunities of late, especially Ethereum (ETHE). For the most part, crypto currencies and associated ETFs trade on technicals as they don't have any fundamentals to evaluate. Of course, they also trade on news, including government regulation and strategist recommendations. But let's be clear. Like the hottest of hot stocks, if something is going up, the masses often will buy and chase. And that is always a slippery slope, as hyper-momentum is great until it isn't. And then things can turn ugly in a hurry.
Recently, ETHE was lit on fire by one of Wall Street's perma-bulls. ETHE broke out to a minor closing all-time high (ATH) and, in the process, broke trendline resistance off the peak since late 2021. The crypto currency has had a huge advance since its April bottom and is playing catchup with Bitcoin, which left it in the dust.
Bitcoin looked like it was going to break out to ATHs, but then was hit hard, declining over 4% on Thursday, with heavy, above-average volume. Price fell right to the 21-day exponential average and then bounced a bit. That puts the short- to intermediate-term direction in question. Many intermediate tops for Bitcoin have been major daily reversals to the downside on an increase in volume.
For the stock market in the short-term, we don't have a great feel currently. We are still working on multiple bearish divergences on a daily basis with respect to the major indices. That's a warning, but not a sell signal. (Mark Arbeter, CMT) Argus• last month
