BJ's Wholesale Club Holdings owns BJ's Wholesale Club, which operates a chain of warehouse clubs in the Eastern U.S. BJ's positions itself between traditional grocery stores and warehouses like Sam's Club and Costco. It offers a wider range of items and smaller pack sizes than Costco and Sam's. The company posted total revenue of $20 billion in FY25, which ended on February 1, 2025. As of 1H26, income from membership fees represented 2.4% of total revenue and 58% of operating income. The company sells name-brand merchandise and food to members, who are small business owners and consumers. Based in Westborough, Massachusetts, the company also offers specialty services, including tire installation, optical services, and photo developing.
At the end of fiscal 2Q26, the company operated 255 BJ's clubs and 190 gas stations in 21 states. More than half of the clubs are in four states: New York, Florida, Massachusetts, and New Jersey. About 23% of FY25 sales were generated in the New York City metro area (down from 25% in FY21 and FY20). Clubs range from 43,000 to 177,000 square feet. BJ's sells a relatively narrow assortment of approximately 7,000 SKUs, which it has discussed trimming to about 6,000 to improve inventory turnover.
Groceries represented 71% of the company's FY25 net sales (70% in FY24, 67% in FY23, 71% in FY22); general merchandise and services accounted for 11% in FY25, 11% in FY24, and 12% in FY23 and 14% in FY22. Gasoline rose to 21% in FY23 from 15% in FY22 and 9% in FY21. Gas was 19% of sales in FY24 and 18% in FY25.
A predecessor company, BJ's Wholesale Club, traded as a public company until it was acquired on September 30, 2011, by an investor group led by Leonard Green & Partners and CVC Capital. On July 2, 2018, the company again went public as BJ's Wholesale Club Holdings on the NYSE. CVC and Leonard Green held no shares when the company published its FY21 annual report.
The company's fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to January 31. The convention at Argus, Bloomberg, and other data service providers is to number the fiscal year based on the calendar year in which it ends. BJ's current fiscal will end on January 31, 2026. We thus call the current year FY26 while the company calls it FY25. The year we call FY25 had 52 weeks. The year ended February 3, 2024, had 53 weeks. Rating

Stocks rose again on Thursday. The first revision to second-quarter GDP showed an increase to 3.3%, an unexpected pop from the initial estimate and a rebound from a 0.5% pullback in the first quarter. Now investors will be waiting to see what the July PCE report brings. Argus• 27 days ago
BJ's Wholesale Earnings: Softening Top-Line Growth on Consumer Caution, but Shares Remain Expensive
BJ’s Wholesale serves as one of the few warehouse club chains in the United States. Its 250 warehouses are primarily located along the East Coast, most prominently in the New England area. Similar to its warehouse club peers, BJ’s charges annual membership fees and keeps costs down by operating a “no-frills” store environment. The company limits the use of distribution centers where possible and stores inventory on pallets directly on the sales floor, often in bulk quantities. The company also offers a limited assortment of 7,000 stock-keeping units at its warehouses to achieve greater procurement scale on select items. About 80% of BJ’s net sales come from grocery items and general merchandise, with the remaining 20% stemming from gasoline and other ancillary services.
