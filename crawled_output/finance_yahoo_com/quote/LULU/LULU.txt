Stock indices are all flashing red at midday on Friday, in a session that has featured roller-coaster moves. The jobs report this morning was much weaker than expected and featured downward revisions as well, and that news is the cause of today's volatile action. The good news/bad news fight is between those who see the jobs report as guaranteeing lower interest rates and those who see the same report as an ominous sign of a slowing economy. The futures were flat before the report, prices popped higher after the report, and now, as midday approaches, the major indices are off about 0.70% (with the VIX up almost 9% as of this writing).
