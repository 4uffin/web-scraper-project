Large Cap US Pick List - September 2025
This pick list highlights constituents of the Morningstar US Large Cap Index that we believe offer investors the best risk-adjusted return prospects. Stocks of large-cap companies where neither growth nor value characteristics predominate. Stocks in the top 70% of the capitalization of the U.S. equity market are defined as large cap. Morningstar• 16 days ago
Fed Clears Path for Longer Bull Run
The current bull market started in October 2022 and has seen the S&P 500 rise more than 80%, enduring high inflation, economic uncertainty, a credit-rating downgrade of the U.S. Treasury, an election, and tariffs and trade wars. It has been supported by an economy that continues to grow, inflation and interest rates that have been heading lower, and robust profitability from S&P 500 companies. Last week, Fed Chairman Powell signaled that the central bank is ready to move off the sidelines and start reducing interest rates again. Although he didn't say the Fed would lower rates at its next meeting, he noted that a "shifting balance of risks" between the bank's goals of full employment and low inflation "may warrant" a change in policy. Stocks rallied on the news, and the S&P 500 is again at an all-time high. How much farther can this bull market go?
We studied the 13 bull markets that occurred since the end of World War II. On average, the S&P 500 gained 164% during these 13 periods, which averaged 57 months in duration. Recent bull markets have generated higher returns over longer periods of time. On average, the five bull markets since 1980 have seen stocks advance about 240% over 70 months. And the bull market prior to the pandemic lasted 11 years, during which stocks rose 500%. Still, it is worth pointing out that the 2009-2020 bull market began with stocks deeply depressed on valuation, whereas stocks currently are near fair value. Even so, if rates continue to head lower on mild inflation news, earnings growth accelerates, and the economy avoids a recession, this new bull market, led by the performance of disruptive technology companies, could have room to run.

The Immigration Effect on Jobs
President Trump's immigration agenda centers on stricter enforcement, expanded deportations, and cuts to legal immigration. Pitched as protecting American jobs, the implications for the labor market and inflation are nuanced. The current labor force is 170.3 million, according to the St. Louis Fed. The force has grown at an annual rate of 0.8% on average since 2000, an increase of about 1 million workers each year. Immigration has been a big part of that growth, accounting for over 70% of prime-age labor force growth since 2017, per the CBO. That trend looks to be headed the other direction, as the Trump administration set a target for thousands of deportations per day. Not all of the deportees are in the labor force, but the emphasis on immigration will almost certainly mean tighter labor supply, upward wage pressure, and stickier inflation -- especially in low-wage, labor-reliant sectors like construction (14% unauthorized workers), food service (10%), and agriculture (43%).
For companies already grappling with services inflation running above 3.5% year over year, higher wages threaten to embed costs. We draw five takeaways: 1) Labor scarcity could trim 0.2-0.3 percentage points from GDP annually; 2) Persistent wage pressure may force the Fed to stay restrictive longer; 3) Labor-heavy industries could see margin compression; 4) Immigration policy will shape sector-level winners -- automation, defense, logistics; 5) Political risk is now economic risk. At target rates, deportation could result in a reduction in the labor force of around 1 million by early 2026, as well as a 40 basis point decrease in the labor-force participation rate. The unemployment rate stands at 4.1%, due in part to labor-force contraction, which prevents the rate from spiking. Immigration constraints may prove a headwind to disinflation and productivity, reinforcing the importance of stock picks with pricing power, cost flexibility, and real earnings growth.
