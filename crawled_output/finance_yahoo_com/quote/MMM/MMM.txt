Argus Quick Note: Weekly Stock List for 09/08/2025: Companies Raising Guidance
During the recent earnings season, many companies across many sectors raised guidance. That is admirable, especially during uncertain economic times. We track the companies raising guidance and look for trends. Indeed, Management Signals is one of our Investment Themes for 2025. The sectors with the most companies raising guidance in the past quarter were Communication Services, Healthcare, Industrial, and Information Technology. Sectors underrepresented were Financial, Energy, and Consumer Staples. Raising guidance in the face of tariff and macroeconomic uncertainty could signal strong management, flexibility, and resilience. As well, increased guidance is often a catalyst for market-beating returns in the quarters ahead. The following is a partial list of companies in Argus' Fundamental Universe of Coverage at which management increased its outlook during the recent reporting season, with our rating and the sector designation noted. We like this theme, as it crosses numerous industries and generates a robust list of potential portfolio candidates. Argus• 17 days ago
This is certainly a tricky stock market, one that refuses to show its hand.
This is certainly a tricky stock market, one that refuses to show its hand. Of course, trend changes (if that is what is happening) often fool the masses. The S&P 500 (SPX), S&P 100 (OEX), Dow Jones Industrials, and the NYSE Composite have now gone in different directions from the prior day for six straight days. If we had the historical data, we'd guess it would show that such a pattern is very rare. To make things even odder, both the SPX and the OEX actually have been in a short-term uptrend during the six-day period. Monday's losses were very mild, on a range of -0.1% to -0.4%.
So far, earnings reports has been good to very good, especially for the mega-cap Information Technology names. However, a number of IT giants that beat estimates have given some, if not all, of their price gains back after initial one-day pops. That is not unexpected and is something we talked about going into earnings season, as these behemoths (and many other stocks) have seen large advances since the April bottom. Indeed, expectations were high and, despite the beats, stellar earnings results in many cases were not "good enough."
Focusing on the Nasdaq 100, the largest gainers on Monday primarily were stocks with weak technical rankings. Other than highly ranked EA, MU, APP, and GILD (which rose), the rest of the strength was in low-quality names when it comes to technical strength and attractive-looking charts. So rotation and churning seem to be the name of the game and, eventually, that might lead to some downside as well as pickup in volatility. Interestingly, on a quiet, uneventful day, the VIX volatility index shot up over 7%. (Mark Arbeter, CMT) Argus• last month
August a Challenge for Investors
The dog days of summer may be perfect for a vacation at the beach (or in the mountains, as is the case with the Federal Reserve board), but investors don't always get to enjoy the month of August. Indeed, our analysis of monthly returns going back to 1980 indicates that the eighth month of the year is ahead of only one other month -- the dreaded September -- in terms of average return. There have been some hits. The month has a "win percentage" of 56% and S&P 500 rose 1.3% in August last year. But there have also been some real clunkers, including 1981 (-6%), 1990 (-9.4%), 1998 (-14.6%), 2001 (-6.4%), and 2015 (-6.3%).
August generally is a quiet month on Wall Street. The second quarter earnings reports are for the most part finished in July, though retailers and a few stragglers will still be reporting. The IPO market, relatively quiet this year, often goes into a period of deep hibernation, and volume tends to be light -- which is perfect for higher volatility. This August, nerves are likely to remain on edge as the Federal Reserve debates upcoming changes to policy and President Trump uses his pulpit to espouse his views on tariffs, interest rates, and the quality of employment data. We continue to stress a focus on quality companies (with strong earnings, balance sheets, and management teams) as the markets approach what typically has been a difficult two-month stretch. Argus• last month
Fed's Favorite Inflation Indicator
The Fed's favorite inflation indicator, the PCE Price Index, will be released by the BEA on Thursday morning. The index differs from the better-known Consumer Price Index (CPI) because its composition is changed more frequently and it is thus quicker to reflect the impact of real-time pricing. In the most-recent report, PCE inflation reportedly increased at a 2.3% rate year over year through May. By comparison, the latest CPI report, through June, had overall inflation rising 2.7%. Core PCE, which removes volatile food and energy prices, had risen at an annual rate of 2.7% in the latest month. Our PCE forecasts call for mostly stable readings for June: 2.5% for the headline number and 2.7% for the core reading. We think lingering inflation in certain sticky-priced services (transportation and shelter) will combine with tariff impacts to present a challenge for the Fed as it strives for its 2% goal. Overall, inflation in this cycle peaked in summer 2022 and has been on a fairly consistent downward trek since then. We track 20 inflation measures on a monthly basis. On average, they are indicating that prices are rising at a 2.6% rate year over year, flat compared to the revised month-ago level.
The numbers are volatile and can be distorted by swings within the Producer Price Inflation report. Focusing on core inflation -- which we obtain by averaging Core CPI, market-based PCE Ex-Food & Energy (from the GDP report), the five-year forward inflation expectation rate,
the 10-year TIPs Break-even Interest Rate, and the PCE Price Index
-- our reading is 2.79%, up about 10 basis points month over month.
We expect the Fed to remain on the sideline for the summer and then implement two rate cuts later in 2025, with the ultimate goal of aligning the fed funds rate to approximately 100-150 basis points above the long-term inflation rate within the next 6-8 quarters. Argus• last month
