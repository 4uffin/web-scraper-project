Argus Quick Note: Weekly Stock List for 09/08/2025: Companies Raising Guidance
During the recent earnings season, many companies across many sectors raised guidance. That is admirable, especially during uncertain economic times. We track the companies raising guidance and look for trends. Indeed, Management Signals is one of our Investment Themes for 2025. The sectors with the most companies raising guidance in the past quarter were Communication Services, Healthcare, Industrial, and Information Technology. Sectors underrepresented were Financial, Energy, and Consumer Staples. Raising guidance in the face of tariff and macroeconomic uncertainty could signal strong management, flexibility, and resilience. As well, increased guidance is often a catalyst for market-beating returns in the quarters ahead. The following is a partial list of companies in Argus' Fundamental Universe of Coverage at which management increased its outlook during the recent reporting season, with our rating and the sector designation noted. We like this theme, as it crosses numerous industries and generates a robust list of potential portfolio candidates. Argus• 17 days ago

The major U.S. indices are slightly higher at midday on Friday, as earnings
The major U.S. indices are slightly higher at midday on Friday, as earnings news and tariff talk are atop the headlines. On the tariff front, Donald Trump is now putting 50-50 odds on whether a deal with the EU will happen by August 1, and also said that his administration has not 'had a lot of luck' in discussions with Canada. As well, there are financial press reports that the already announced U.S.-Japan deal has possibly hit a snag related to how profits will be shared on Japan's proposed investment in the U.S. Argus• 2 months ago
