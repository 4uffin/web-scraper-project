Argus Quick Note: Weekly Stock List for 08/04/2025: New Stocks In Our Universe of Coverage
The Argus coverage list is growing, with exciting new companies being added. We are selective, choosing companies that we believe demonstrate growth, innovation, and strong investment potential. As such, most new stocks are rated BUY, but occasionally there is a HOLD-rated new company if we see potential. The Argus Research Fundamental Universe of Coverage includes over 500 leading U.S. and international companies. We cover the waterfront -- from Technology to Utilities from Energy to Healthcare. Generally, we follow the top 200 most widely held stocks, a list we source from our sister company Vickers Stock Research, which collects institutional ownership data from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. From there, we look to identify the next 200-300 emerging U.S. and international companies to fill out our list. Our Universe of Coverage is dynamic and growing. We are continually adding stocks and often get great ideas from our clients (use https://www.argusresearch.com/ContactUs.aspx if you'd like to send us your ideas). Here are some of the additions we have made so far in 2025.
