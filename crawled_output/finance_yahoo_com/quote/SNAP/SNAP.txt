As Other Pillars Tremble, Earnings Remain Solid
The U.S. stock market
As Other Pillars Tremble, Earnings Remain Solid The U.S. stock market continued higher in the first week of August, as unsettling jobs data was superseded by tariffs for many nations that were not as bad as feared. We have noted that, since the post-pandemic period and really reaching back to recovery out of the Great Recession of 2008-2009, three bulwarks of bull markets have been employment, the economy, and earnings. July nonfarm payrolls and, even more so, the steep downward revisions in June and May data, signal a slowing in jobs creation. Over the first half of 2025, the U.S. economy, as measured by gross domestic product (GDP), appears to have been distorted by trade positioning in advance of and around tariffs. That has made it an unreliable indicator of the underlying health of the economy at a time of major trade upheaval. Through an unsettled time, one major support for stocks has been a steady drumbeat of better-than-expected calendar second-quarter 2025 earnings reports. Earnings growth is running ahead of expectations, which is one constant in almost any earnings season; yet many were not counting on that constant this time.
Earnings: Outperforming Expectations, as Usual For the second quarter of 2025, S&P 500 earnings from continuing operations for 2Q25 have increased in the range of high-single-digit to low-double-digit percentages. According to Bloomberg, and with about two-thirds of companies having reported, second-quarter earnings are up 9% year over year from 2Q24. According to FactSet, earnings growth for the quarter to date is 8.4%. Refinitiv is an outlier, reporting that second-quarter 2025 earnings from continuing operations are up 13.2% year over year.
As a reminder, the three agencies may have different prior-year baselines and varying definitions of what constitutes continuing-operations earnings. Once all 500 companies have reported, the three agencies tend to be in reasonable accord on final growth rates. One thing the three agencies have in common is that they began with much lower growth estimates based on blended rates, which encompass both actual reported numbers and estimates for yet-to-report companies. Prior to earnings season, blended EPS growth estimates for 2Q25 were in the 1%-4% range. As more and more companies have reported results that were above expectations, the blended rate has risen. We believe analysts were unusually cautious heading into second-quarter earnings season due to tariffs, signs of slowing consumer spending, impacts from immigration enforcement policies, and other factors. To date, 80%-82% of companies with positive earnings have reported results that were above consensus expectations. That compares with a long-run average of 75%. Analyst caution may also be contributing to the magnitude of the beat against consensus expectations. According to FactSet, companies are reporting earnings that are 8.4% above estimates, which is above the 10-year average of 6.9%. Bloomberg has a more conservative take on the magnitude of the earnings beat, calculating that EPS has come in about 7% above consensus.
At the sector level, the best earnings growth in 2Q25 is coming from Communication Services, Information Technology, and Financial; earnings for all three have increased in upper-teens percentages. Sectors with more moderate, but still positive, growth include Industrial, Consumer Discretionary, Real Estate, and Utilities.
The three agencies differ on which sectors are posting lower earnings for the quarter. Refinitiv and FactSet have Healthcare in the positive category, while Bloomberg reports lower earnings for the sector. Other sectors in dispute include Consumer Staples and Materials. All three agencies agree that Energy is the weakest sector, with earnings down in high-teen percentages.
Digging down to the industry level, most of the growth in Communication Services is coming from media (up 22%); telecom services is up in mid-single-digits. In Financial, insurance earnings growth is strongest, perhaps reflecting a quiet claims season. Bank earnings are weakest, but are up in double-digits. The best growth in Information Technology is coming from semiconductors, followed by software and Services and then by technology hardware and equipment; here, too, all industries are up in double-digits.
Consumer Discretionary, one of the most diverse sectors, shows a real dichotomy, with retailing earnings up over 25% but consumer durable and apparel down over 35%. The decline in Healthcare earnings, according to Bloomberg, is attributable to healthcare equipment and services, where the health insurance giants are truly struggling. Pharmaceutical and biotech earnings are fractionally higher year over year.
Argus came into earnings season modeling the high-single-digit to low-double-digit earnings that are now being delivered. We are not making any changes in our forecasts for S&P 500 earnings from continuing operations, which stand at $270 for 2025 and $300 for 2026.
The Economy and In-Place Tariffs
Second-quarter GDP, much like first-quarter GDP, was highly influenced by positioning around tariffs. According to the advance (first) report, imports rose 38% in the first quarter, reflecting massive pre-ordering by U.S. companies of international goods from overseas. With all those goods stockpiled in the U.S. as of the end of March, imports declined 30% in the second quarter. Imports, which are a subtraction to the calculation of GDP, represented a 5.18 percentage-point contribution to 2Q25 GDP growth, after representing a 4.66 percentage-point reduction to 1Q25 GDP growth.
The change in private inventories also was a huge outlier in terms of its impact on first-half GDP growth. Private inventories represented a 2.59 percentage-point contribution to 1Q25 GDP growth, but then represented a 3.17 percentage-point deduction from 2Q25 GDP growth. The usual headline numbers from the GDP report were buried amid this outlier data. Personal consumption expenditures (PCE) rose 1.4% in 2Q25, up from a 0.5% in the first quarter. PCE growth averaged 2.77% over the 2022-2024 period, and the first-half 2025 growth is running well below that level. Nonresidential fixed investment, the proxy for corporate capital spending, grew 1.9% in 2Q25, down from 10.3% growth in 1Q25. Nonresidential fixed investment growth averaged 5.33% over the 2022-2024 period, so the deceleration from 1Q25 to 2Q25 is noteworthy.
In 2024, PCE represented 68% of GDP spending; and nonresidential fixed investment comprised 14% of spending. Together these two categories represented 82% of GDP in 2024. Their deceleration in 2Q25 from the three-year average is noteworthy. Investors will be laser-focused on these two spending categories in third-quarter GDP, although they will have to wait for the late-October preliminary 3Q25 GDP data. Although some tariff rates may still be in flux, enough are 'final' and, thus, the Yale Budget Lab can calculate an overall tariff rate. As of 8/1/25, Yale stated that U.S. consumers face an overall average effective tariff rate of 18.3%. After consumption shifts, Yale estimates that the average tariff rate will be 17.3%, the highest since 1935. In 1935, the U.S. was still mired in the Great Depression. The Smoot-Hawley tariffs, meant to stimulate growth, did not cause the depression, but some economists believe the tariffs extended the downturn. President Reagan, after signing a U.S.-Canada free trade agreement in 1988, called Smoot-Hawley a 'disaster for the working men and women of this country.'
The world and the U.S. economy are very different today than they were in 1935 or even 1988. The U.S. economy currently is underpinned by highly advanced and indispensable technology as the artificial intelligence era kicks into a higher gear. The U.S. economy also has shown the flexibility and resilience to prevail -- most recently through the COVID-19 pandemic, the supply-chain crisis, and the worst inflation in 40 years.
We expect the U.S. economy to adapt to the current tariff era, although the ride may be bumpy. Argus has raised its forecast for 2025 GDP growth to 1.4% from 1.0%. We also raised our 2026 GDP growth forecast, to 1.7% from a prior 1.5%. Conclusion Implications of the weak jobs report were exacerbated by the firing of Bureau of Labor Commissions Erika McEntarfer, which some investors see as potentially undermining the validity of future data. The White House justified firing Ms. McEntarfer by claiming that recent data was 'rigged' against the president. The Office of Advocacy of the U.S. Small Business Administration, as federal government agency, suggested small businesses were being underrepresented in BLS response rates due to burdensome paperwork. William Beach, who served as BLS commissioner in the first Trump administration, noted that the commissioner has no access to the collection of data, does not see it until 8:30 AM on jobs Friday, and is unable to influence or otherwise adjust any payrolls numbers. Some former and existing federal employees in statistical roles are concerned the firing will cast a pall on future data collection and dissemination. Earnings reports come from individual companies and cannot be massaged or manipulated to advance any party's agenda. Strong earnings growth remains a clear positive of the economy and market, this at a time when other pillars of the economy are under stress. Argus• last month
Snap Earnings: Ad Platform Error and Persistent Weak Monetization Drag Revenue Growth
Snap is a technology company best known for its marquis social media application.
Snapchat, a visual messaging application that has amassed hundreds of millions of users. The app was initially only used to communicate with family and friends through photographs and short videos (known as "Snaps"). Users can now enjoy augmented reality, or AR, lenses, content from famous creators and celebrities, updates about local events, and more. Although the app offers a paid subscription option with premium features, advertising sales produce most of the app’s revenue. The firm also sells wearable devices called AR Spectacles, which can capture photos and videos overlayed with AR lenses, but these make up a small portion of Snap’s overall sales.
