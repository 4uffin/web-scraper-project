Daily – Vickers Top Buyers & Sellers for 07/23/2025
The Vickers Top Buyers & Sellers is a daily report that identifies the five companies the largest insider purchase transactions based on the dollar value of the transactions as well as the five companies the largest insider sales transactions based on the dollar value of the transactions. Argus• 2 months ago
Inflation Relatively Stable
Two important inflation reports -- the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Producer Price Index (PPI) -- were released week and both signaled that pricing pressures were essentially unchanged from the prior month. But they did not show that consumer inflation was still declining toward the Fed's stated 2.0% goal, and it may take a while longer to get to that level. Let's first take a deeper dive into the Consumer Price Index. The news here was so-so, as the month-to-month headline number increased three-tenths of a percent from the previous month; the annualized rate was 2.7%, up from 2.4% a month ago. Meanwhile, the core inflation rate (ex-food and energy) rose two-tenths of a percent month to month, and ticked higher to an annual rate of 2.9% from the prior reading of 2.8%.
The two wild cards in the report have been Transportation Services and Shelter costs. In these sticky categories, recent news has been good, as year-over-year rates have declined meaningfully. Gas prices are also sharply lower year over year, which should please consumers during the summer driving season. The Producer Price Index measures pricing trends farther up the supply chain, at the manufacturing level. Here, the news was better. For example, the PPI final demand annual rate through June was 2.3%, compared to 3.7% in January. Looking ahead and based on the fundamentals, we expect pricing pressures to ease in the months ahead as the housing market cools due to high mortgage rates and the price of oil stays below $90 per barrel. But the current low price of oil reflects a new wild card that has entered the forecasting picture: Donald Trump's trade wars. His tariffs -- should they ever go into full effect -- will almost certainly raise prices, sending the inflation rate higher again. That will put new pressure on the Federal Reserve, which we think (again, based on the fundamentals) should be in position to lower rates two times by the end of the year. Argus• 2 months ago
