Lithium: Shares Plunge on Reports CATL Reopening Lithium Mine Earlier Than Expected
Lithium Americas is a pure-play lithium producer. The firm owns 62% of one resource, Thacker Pass, which is located in northwest Nevada, with automaker General Motors owning the remaining 38%. Thacker Pass is under construction and expected to begin production in 2028. Thacker Pass is one of the largest known lithium resources in the world. The project would be the first clay-based asset to enter production, and we estimate it will be in bottom half of the global cost curve. Management plans to develop Thacker Pass into a fully integrated lithium production site, with downstream refining capabilities on site, and will sell into the lithium chemical market.
