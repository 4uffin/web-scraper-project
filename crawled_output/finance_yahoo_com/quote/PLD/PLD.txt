Core FFO tops consensus
Prologis is a global industrial REIT that owns, builds, and manages space for warehouses, manufacturing, distribution, and large-scale storage. PLD has become the world's largest industrial REIT by focusing on business-to-business fulfillment and e-commerce.
As of the beginning of 2025, PLD's portfolio had just under 5,900 buildings with 1.3 billion square feet of space. Many properties have on-site solar, and about one-fifth of assets are warehouses over 500,000 square feet. The REIT has a presence in 20 countries on four continents, and about 65% of total properties are in North America, which accounted for about 85% of NOI. The company's top tenants are Amazon, Home Depot, and FedEx, with Amazon accounting for about 5% of net effective rent. PLD partners with other companies in joint ventures to reduce risk. The REIT also has a co-investment program labeled Strategic Capital that creates venture opportunities for institutional capital partners. Strategic Capital accounted for about 8% of total 2024 revenues.
PLD has faced pressure from an oversupply of warehouse space due to slowing sales at online retailers. In response, the company has focused on customized facilities and increasing its focus into developing data center facilities. In early 2023, all new development projects were customized, 99% of total units were leased or in negotiations, and joint venture promote income was a key driver of earnings growth. In 2024, about one-third of new development starts were built to suit. Management estimates that the weighted-average stabilized yield of acquisitions in 2024 was about 5%.
The company is a member of the S&P 500 and has a market cap of about $103 billion. Rating
