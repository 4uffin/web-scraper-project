Here Comes Nvidia
This week features a key report on inflation and earnings
Here Comes Nvidia This week features a key report on inflation and earnings news form Nvidia. As well, investors will continue to process the speech made on Friday by Federal Reserve Chairman Powell at the Jackson Hole conference, where he more than hinted that an interest-rate cut is likely at the Fed's September meeting. Last week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.5%, the S&P 500 was flat, and the Nasdaq was down about 0.5%. So far this year, the Dow is up 7%, the S&P 500 10%, and the Nasdaq leads with a gain of 11%.
The earnings calendar this week includes MongoDB reporting on Tuesday; Nvidia, CrowdStrike, Snowflake, Agilent Technologies, and HP Inc. on Wednesday; Dell, Dollar General, Ulta Beauty, and Best Buy on Thursday; and Alibaba on Friday. Some 95% of S&P 500 companies have reported, with 13% growth in corporate earnings compared to the year-ago quarter. That is much better than was expected at the start of reporting season. Communication Services is leading, up 49%, while Energy, down 19%, is at the bottom. The focus of this week's economic calendar the Personal Consumption Expenditures Index (PCE), coming out on Friday and offering news on inflation. Other reports include New Home Sales on Monday, Durable Goods Orders on Tuesday, the second estimate of GDP on Thursday, and Personal Income, Personal Spending, and Consumer Sentiment on Friday. Turning to other data, the Atlanta Fed GDPNow measure calls for GDP of 2.3% in the third quarter. The Cleveland Fed Inflation Nowcast forecasts a 2.8% rate for CPI in August, suggesting higher prices. Mortgage rates were flat last week, with the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at 6.58%, according to FreddieMac. Gas prices also were unchanged at an average of $3.12 per gallon for regular gas.
Looking ahead, the next Federal Reserve interest-rate decision comes on September 17, and odds have jumped to 90% for a cut, according to the CME FedWatch rate tool. After that, the next meeting is on October 29, when odds jump to 95% for a cut.
Taking a deeper dive into performance, U.S. stocks are lagging global stocks. A leading industrialized global stock market index, the ETF EFA, has surged 23% year to date, while the leading emerging market ETF EEM has gained 20%. U.S. growth stocks, with a year-to-date gain of 10% (ETF IWF) have taken the edge over value stocks (ETF IWD), which have booked an advance of 9%. In other asset classes for the year to date AGG bonds are up 2%, gold is up 31%, crude oil is down 10%, and Bitcoin is up 24%. The U.S. dollar is down 9%, tracking DXY. The VIX Volatility Index is at back at 15, below its historical average of 20. Sector performance reveals a mixed picture halfway through 2025. Communication Services leads all sectors with a 17% gain, followed by Information Technology (+16%), Industrials (+14%), and Utilities (+13%), all outperforming the broader market. Defensive sectors like Consumer Staples (+5%) and Materials (+8%) cluster below the S&P 500's average return, while Energy (-1%), and Healthcare (-1%) remain in negative territory for the year.
