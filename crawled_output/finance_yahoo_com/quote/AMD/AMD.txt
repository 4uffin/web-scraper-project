Is an AI bubble forming? We could be pouring gas 'on the fire.' While more tech giants invest heavily into artificial intelligence — Nvidia's (NVDA) multibillion-dollar investments in Intel (INTC) and OpenAI, Alibaba (BABA) raising its AI spending past $50 billion — is an AI bubble starting to form around markets (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC)? Asterozoa Capital CIO Joe Hegener sits down with Morning Brief host Julie Hyman to analyze whether a bubble could be forming around equity markets, driven by AI and the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates.

Argus Quick Note: Weekly Stock List for 08/18/2025: 13Fs Show Big Guns Buying Big Tech
Large institutional investors are buying tech companies. The stock market volatility during 2Q gave institutional investors a chance to buy dips and pick up some tech names at better prices. Taking a look at 13F filings of well-known institutional portfolios, we see that the big guns were busy picking up some new companies and/or adding to existing positions. Buying was across a variety of sectors, but tech names stand out. Vickers Stock Research, a subsidiary of Argus Research Group, analyzes insider trading and institutional stock ownership. Form 13-Fs, which institutions must file to report their holdings, are due 45 days after the end of calendar quarters and have come in for 2Q25. We review 13Fs of major institutional investors, including activists, to see what they are buying and to look for trends. Based on data from Vickers, here are select purchases made in 2Q by some high-profile money managers. The ratings listed are from Argus Research. Argus• last month
