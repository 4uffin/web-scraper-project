Stocks are flat at Tuesday midday. The labor market was worse than originally
Stocks are flat at Tuesday midday. The labor market was worse than originally thought last year. A lot worse. Newly revised jobs data shows 911,000 fewer jobs created during the March 2024 to March 2025 time period than previously thought. That's a big number. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note is 4.08%. Crude oil is at $63 per barrel. Argus• 12 days ago

Kenvue: Shares Tumble From Kennedy's Pending Report on Tylenol and Autism; FVE Stays at $24.50
Kenvue is the world’s largest pure-play consumer health company by sales, generating over $15 billion in annual revenue. Formerly known as Johnson & Johnson’s consumer segment, Kenvue spun off and went public in May 2023. It operates in a variety of silos within consumer health, such as cough, cold and allergy care, pain management, face and body care, and oral care, as well as women’s health. Its portfolio has some of the most well-known brands in the space, including Tylenol, Listerine, Johnson’s, Aveeno, and Neutrogena. Despite playing in a fragmented industry with intense competition and changing consumer preferences, many of Kenvue’s brands are the global leader in their respective segment thanks to their strong brand power.
