Sector momentum could be well timed after sell-off
Consolidated Edison serves 3 million electric customers, 1.1 million gas customers, and 1,800 steam customers throughout the New York region. ED provides a wide range of energy-related products and services through the following subsidiaries: Consolidated Edison Co. of New York (CECONY), a regulated utility providing electricity, gas, and steam in New York City and Westchester County; Orange and Rockland Utilities, a utility serving customers in southeastern New York State, northern New Jersey, and northeastern Pennsylvania; Con Edison Solutions, a retail energy supply and services company; Con Edison Energy, a wholesale energy supply company; Con Edison Development, which owns and operates generating plants and participates in other infrastructure projects; and Con Ed Transmission, a FERC-regulated electric and natural gas utility. The company employs approximately 15,000 people.
With the sale of Con Edison Clean Energy Businesses, Con Ed has become a pure-play regulated utility with about 94% of assets at CECONY, which also accounts for approximately 93% of total revenues. The company has little generating power except for steam production, and purchases and transports gas from as far away as Canada and the Gulf of Mexico. In 2023, gas accounted for 21% of revenues and electricity accounted for about 74%, with about half of electric revenues from businesses and municipal customers. ED is increasing investment in solar and wind generation and is targeting net-zero emissions by 2040. The current market cap is about $34.7 billion. Rating

Stocks are mixed at midday on Wednesday. The Federal Reserve comes out with its latest rate decision today at 2pm, followed by the usual press conference with Chairman Jerome Powell. This time Wall Street gets the added bonus of the Fed's dot plot which is a predicting tool for the future of rates. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note is 4.04%. Crude oil is at $63 per barrel.

Con Ed's CECONY Rate Case Will Determine Near-Term Growth Outlook
Con Ed is a holding company for Consolidated Edison of New York, or CECONY, and Orange & Rockland, or O&R. These utilities provide steam, natural gas, and electricity to customers in southeastern New York—including New York City—and small parts of New Jersey. The two utilities generate nearly all of Con Ed's earnings following the sale of its clean energy business to RWE in early 2023.
