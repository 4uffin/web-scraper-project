Stock indices are lower at midday on Thursday. Issues of note today include
Stock indices are lower at midday on Thursday. Issues of note today include the Fed's Jackson Hole meeting and the pending commentary from Chairman Powell. As well, earnings from Walmart failed to impress and there are some possible new worries about the jobs environment. On that score, the Labor Department reported that initial claims for state unemployment benefits climbed 11,000 to a seasonally adjusted 235,000 for the week ended August 16. That is the largest increase since late May and suggests a possible weakening in the labor market. Finally, there is a bit of good news in that existing home sales rose 2% last month as homebuyers seemingly responded to a modest pullback in mortgage rates and slowing home price growth.
