Expedia's International Business Outperforming US Demand Amid Tariff Policy Uncertainty

Expedia operates a number of branded travel booking sites, but its three core online travel agency brands are Expedia, Hotels.com, and Vrbo. It also has a metasearch brand, Trivago. Transaction fees for online bookings account for the bulk of sales and profits.

Stocks are higher at midday on Friday, albeit by relatively modest amounts.
Stocks are higher at midday on Friday, albeit by relatively modest amounts. The Nasdaq Composite leads the pack, followed by the S&P 500 and then the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Russell 2000.
Meanwhile, gold is getting it fair share of attention today on news of U.S. tariffs on gold bars from Switzerland. It remains to be seen if stocks can maintain their momentum today, as yesterday' session started strong but ended lower and the overall tone of late has been up-and-down in nature. Still, all-time highs are in play for the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 and investors have seemingly kept the faith while faced with a volatile news flow during the week. Argus• last month
