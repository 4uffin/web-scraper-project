Stocks gave up some more ground on Wednesday and (probably not surprising)
Stocks gave up some more ground on Wednesday and (probably not surprising) two-day losing streaks have not been very common since the secondary low traced out on April 21. The S&P 500 has given back only 0.9% over the past two days, so we can't make much out of it. The index fell 1.3% over the two days ending September 2, and 2% going into August. Prior to that, we have seen two-day losses of more than 1% only twice (in May). This illustrates what we all know: the mega-cap index has been in an extremely tight uptrend for multiple months, with very bullish price action. Despite the many reasons for a pullback (including overbought and divergent momentum, weakening breadth, high bullish sentiment, and lousy seasonals), the market has ignored the concerns and crawled higher.
We are in the weakest part of the year, as the back half of September historically has not been a good time to own stocks. But so far this year, there has not been much in the way of downside action. Going back to 1950, we can find average losses for every day of September starting with September 20 and extending until September 30. The larger losses tend to occur over the last six trading days of the month (which started on Tuesday this year).
By some measures, sentiment recently kicked into high gear, especially in the options market. The CBOE equity-only put/call (PC) ratio has been fairly low for the past two days, at 0.45 and 0.47. The average daily put/call in 2025 is around 0.60. The five-day has fallen to 0.5, the lowest in four months and just before a minor pullback. However, as long as the 21-day P/C is falling (and it is), it is bullish for stocks. Argus• 12 hours ago
