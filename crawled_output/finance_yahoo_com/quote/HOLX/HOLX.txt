Walmart Reports
Walmart and other big retailers report this week and likely
Walmart Reports Walmart and other big retailers report this week and likely will comment on tariffs and the related impact on profits. Meanwhile, many members of the Federal Reserve will convene in Jackson Hole, with Chairman Powell making a highly anticipated speech. Wall Street believes the Fed will cut rates at its next meeting and analysts are looking for signs of confirmation. Last week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500, and the Nasdaq were all up 1%-2%. Year to date, the Dow is up 6%, the S&P 500 has climbed 10%, and the Nasdaq has booked a 12% gain.
The list of companies reporting earnings this week includes Palo Alto Networks on Monday; Toll Brothers on Tuesday; Target on Wednesday; Walmart and Intuit on Thursday; and Williams-Sonoma and BJ's on Friday. Some 92% of S&P 500 companies have reported so far, resulting in 13% growth in corporate earnings compared to the year-ago quarter. That is much better than was expected at the start of reporting season. Communication Services is leading, up 49%, while Energy, down 19%, is at the bottom. This week's economic calendar is light. Reports include Housing Starts and Building Permits on Tuesday; Minutes from the last Federal Reserve Open Market meeting on Wednesday; and Existing Home Sales on Thursday. The Jackson Hole Economic Symposium also starts on Thursday, with Chairman Powell speaking on Friday. Turning to other data, the Atlanta Fed GDPNow forecast is at 2.5% for 3Q. The Cleveland Fed Inflation Nowcast is at 2.8% for CPI in August, suggesting a climb in prices from prior months. Mortgage rates inched down again last week, with the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at 6.58%, according to FreddieMac. Gas prices went down two cents to an average of $3.12 per gallon for regular gas.
Looking ahead, the next Federal Reserve rate decision is on September 17, and odds have jumped to 90% for a cut, according to the CME FedWatch rate tool. After that, the next meeting is on October 29, and odds jump to 95% for a cut. Taking a deeper dive into performance, U.S. stocks are lagging global stocks. A leading industrialized global stock market index, the EFA ETF, has surged 21% year to date, while the leading emerging market ETF EEM has gained 19%. U.S. growth stocks, with a year-to-date gain of 11% (ETF ticker IWF) have taken the edge over value stocks, which show an advance of 8% when looking at value ETF IWD. In other asset classes for the year to date AGG Bonds are up 2%, gold is up 30%, crude oil is down 10%, and Bitcoin is up 27%. The U.S. dollar is down 9%, tracking DXY. The VIX Volatility Index is at back at 15, below its historical average of 20 (which aligns with a bull market). Sector performance reveals a mixed picture halfway through 2025.
Information Technology leads all sectors with a 16% gain, followed closely by Communication Services (+15%), Industrials (+14%), and Utilities (+14%), which are outperforming the broader market. More defensive sectors like Consumer Staples (+6%) and Materials (+6%) cluster below the S&P 500's average return, while Consumer Discretionary (-2%), Energy (-1%), and Healthcare (-6%) remain in negative territory for the year. Real Estate (+1%) is up, but continues to struggle amid elevated interest rates. Argus• last month
