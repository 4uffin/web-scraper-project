Morningstar | A Weekly Summary of Stock Ideas and Developments in the Companies We Cover
In this edition, luxury items still have some sparkle; AI value is generating questions; OPEC+ fuels up for a battle; and Edenred, Intuit, and Hensoldt.
Morningstar• 19 hours ago
Nine stocks (NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, GOOGL, AMZN, META, AVGO, TSM, TSLA) have trillion-dollar market caps and total about $23 trillion dollars.
Nine stocks (NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, GOOGL, AMZN, META, AVGO, TSM, TSLA) have trillion-dollar market caps and total about $23 trillion dollars. Maybe we should rename the Mag 7 the Mag 9? Eight of the nine are in the S&P 500 and make up a whopping 35% of the index! TSM is not in the SPX because S&P's selection committee considers only companies with U.S. headquarters. TSM makes up 23% of the iShares MSCI Taiwan ETF (EWT). The eight U.S. stocks represent an incredible 50% of the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ).
If we were to add five more stocks (NFLX, COST, PLTR, TMUS, and CSCO) to the above eight, the 13 stocks represent a whopping 60% of the QQQ. We point this out because these indices, in our opinion, are no longer considered a way to get diversification in a total portfolio. They are, in fact, a huge wager on artificial intelligence (AI) and almost everything else that has to do with technology. In a smaller way, they are a bet on consumer spending. So far, and probably for the foreseeable future, investments in these indices have worked like a charm.
Our concerns about the technical position of the stock market have gone unheeded. When markets ignore momentum divergences, bearish chart patterns, high insider selling (especially in IT), exuberant sentiment, lagging breadth, and weak seasonals, it is categorically bullish. Using price alone as the final arbiter, the indices never gave us reason to be concerned. Until that happens, the very calm crawl higher seems likely to continue. By the way, the second half of September is supposed to be the worst part of the year for stocks, but we will see. (Mark Arbeter, CMT) Argus• yesterday
The S&P 500 and S&P 100 posted minor all-time highs last week, while the Nasdaq and the Nasdaq 100 got very close.
The S&P 500 and S&P 100 posted minor all-time highs last week, while the Nasdaq and the Nasdaq 100 got very close. Yet the overall market still seems a bit shaky. The advancing days mostly have been small, and there have been a number of nasty downside days. The weaker days also have occurred on heavy or rising volume, a subtle sign of institutional distribution. The declining days mostly have been led by the Information Technology sector, which currently makes up about 42% of the S&P 500 (including IT stocks in the Communication Services sector, such as META and GOOGL). And despite hitting/almost hitting all-time highs, the major indices haven't gone anywhere since their intraday peaks on July 31.
The big economic news for this shortened first week of September is Friday's August jobs report. There also are a number of Federal Reserve speakers over the next four days. In addition, we have some important technology earnings reports this week, including ZS on Tuesday; CRM, CRDO, and HPE on Wednesday; and AVGO and CIEN on Thursday.
The big winners last week were mostly from Consumer Discretionary (gambling, footwear, and recreational services), Information Technology (software and computer hardware), Energy (exploration and production and integrated oil and gas), Materials (gold mining and specialty chemicals), and Financial (banks and consumer finance). On the downside were Consumer Staples (soft drinks and food products), Healthcare (pharmaceuticals, medical supplies, medical equipment, and biotech), and Industrials (building materials, railroad, and trucking).
