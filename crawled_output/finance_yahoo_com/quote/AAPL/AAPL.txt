On September 9, the S&P 500, S&P 100, Invesco S&P 500 Top 50 ETF (XLG), Nasdaq,
On September 9, the S&P 500, S&P 100, Invesco S&P 500 Top 50 ETF (XLG), Nasdaq, and Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) all hit all-time highs, albeit very minor new highs. In a recent technical commentary, we wrote that since the start of August, the S&P 500 and S&P 100 were possibly working to emerge from a somewhat rare formation known as a rising consolidation. These bullish patters are seen after strong multi-month rallies and when many are looking for a technical pullback (like us). We noted that the recent pause was tight, with a minor slope to the upside - and said that we were looking for some follow-through to the upside as confirmation of the pattern.
The above is still the case, and now we can add the Nasdaq, Nasdaq 100 and the XLG to the list. Sometimes the break higher out of these formations can be sharp. While big short-term gains are always enjoyable, they can lead to parabolic, blow-off moves that have little staying power. So, the question is as follows. Do you want your gains in two weeks or spread out over two months? Despite the powerful move since late 2022, certain breadth measures are not showing the consistent strength we typically see. Some 61% of S&P 100 stocks are above their 200-day average, down from a peak of 85% in December 2023. Those above their 50-day have fallen to 44%. On the positive side, the advance-decline (AD) line for the index is very close to an all-time high, and the AD line for volume also is near an all-time high. Argus• 8 days ago
Apple: Not Much More Air Under Its Wings With Mostly Evolutionary iPhone Updates
Apple is among the largest companies in the world, with a broad portfolio of hardware and software products targeted at consumers and businesses. Apple’s iPhone makes up a majority of the firm sales, and Apple’s other products like Mac, iPad, and Watch are designed around the iPhone as the focal point of an expansive software ecosystem. Apple has progressively worked to add new applications, like streaming video, subscription bundles, and augmented reality. The firm designs its own software and semiconductors while working with subcontractors like Foxconn and TSMC to build its products and chips. Slightly less than half of Apple’s sales come directly through its flagship stores, with a majority of sales coming indirectly through partnerships and distribution.

On Wednesday, technology heavyweights Alphabet and Apple soared 9% and 3.6%, respectively.
On Wednesday, technology heavyweights Alphabet and Apple soared 9% and 3.6%, respectively. In keeping with that, the Nasdaq gained 1%, the Nasdaq 100 and S&P 100 added 0.8%, the Invesco S&P 500 Top 50 ETF (XLG) rose 0.9%, and the S&P 500 added 0.5%. The rest of the stock indices were mostly flat to lower. The Information Technology sector (XLK) rose 0.5% as weakness in electrical components and equipment as well as semiconductors counteracted the AAPL gain, while Communication Services (XLC) popped 1.6% to an all-time high on GOOGL's strength. The lack of gains in the overall market was disappointing, given the move in two of the members in the stock market's trillion-dollar market-cap club.
The all-important semiconductor industry is looking a bit toppy from a short- to intermediate-term perspective. The iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) gave up 0.5% on Wednesday -- and in the 12 days ending September 2, there have been four distribution days. The 14-day relative strength index (RSI) has traced out multiple divergences since momentum peaked back in early July and has crossed into bearish territory below 50%. The daily moving-average convergence/divergence (MACD) is about to cross into bearish territory, the 21-day rate-of-change (ROC) is close to turning negative, the ETF is below its 50-day average, and there has been a bearish five-day/13-day exponential moving average (EMA) crossover for the first time since February. Yet despite all these bearish signals, the SOXX continues to hold tough.
NVDA has completed a small head-and-shoulders top -- and in the 10 days ending 9/3, has seen six distribution days. The stock is under its 50-day, sports a bearish five-/13-day EMA crossover, the 21-day ROC is negative, and daily momentum is bearish. (Mark Arbeter, CMT) Argus• 15 days ago
