Stock indices saw nice gains again on Monday, as the technology road grader (AI) keeps grinding along.
Stock indices saw nice gains again on Monday, as the technology road grader (AI) keeps grinding along. Monday it was tech and only tech, as the sector ETF (XLK) popped 1.5%. Other than the very low-weighted Utilities sector, which rose 1%, there were minor gains in Real Estate and Industrials and losses or no movement in the seven other S&P 500 sectors. NYSE breadth was flat and NYSE advancing volume versus declining volume also was even. Yet the S&P 500 gained 0.4%, the S&P 100 added 0.5%, the Nasdaq rose 0.7%, and the Nasdaq 100 was up 0.6%. We did see some continued participation by the small-cap indices and even the Russell 2000 crept into all-time high territory last week.
The mega-cap dominance continues and the daily moves in these behemoths remains jaw dropping. Computer hardware popped 4%, led by AAPL's 4.3% surge. Semiconductors climbed about 2% (depending on which index you use), aided by NVDA's 4% spike as well as a 3% gain by TSM. Semi equipment names remain on fire, with LRCX, AMAT, and KLAC all adding between 2.5% and 5.5%. Components of the computer services and electrical components industries also had a big day.
It certainly feels like we are in the melt-up stage of the rally that started back in April, as the major indices have once again reached overbought conditions on the daily charts and have cycled into overbought territory on a weekly basis. The price action has been steep since early September, and the angle of ascent is starting to accelerate on the Nasdaq and the QQQ. While this can go on for some time, it is a warning.

On September 9, the S&P 500, S&P 100, Invesco S&P 500 Top 50 ETF (XLG), Nasdaq,
On September 9, the S&P 500, S&P 100, Invesco S&P 500 Top 50 ETF (XLG), Nasdaq, and Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) all hit all-time highs, albeit very minor new highs. In a recent technical commentary, we wrote that since the start of August, the S&P 500 and S&P 100 were possibly working to emerge from a somewhat rare formation known as a rising consolidation. These bullish patters are seen after strong multi-month rallies and when many are looking for a technical pullback (like us). We noted that the recent pause was tight, with a minor slope to the upside - and said that we were looking for some follow-through to the upside as confirmation of the pattern.
The above is still the case, and now we can add the Nasdaq, Nasdaq 100 and the XLG to the list. Sometimes the break higher out of these formations can be sharp. While big short-term gains are always enjoyable, they can lead to parabolic, blow-off moves that have little staying power. So, the question is as follows. Do you want your gains in two weeks or spread out over two months? Despite the powerful move since late 2022, certain breadth measures are not showing the consistent strength we typically see. Some 61% of S&P 100 stocks are above their 200-day average, down from a peak of 85% in December 2023. Those above their 50-day have fallen to 44%. On the positive side, the advance-decline (AD) line for the index is very close to an all-time high, and the AD line for volume also is near an all-time high. Argus• 12 days ago
Apple: Not Much More Air Under Its Wings With Mostly Evolutionary iPhone Updates
Apple is among the largest companies in the world, with a broad portfolio of hardware and software products targeted at consumers and businesses. Apple’s iPhone makes up a majority of the firm sales, and Apple’s other products like Mac, iPad, and Watch are designed around the iPhone as the focal point of an expansive software ecosystem. Apple has progressively worked to add new applications, like streaming video, subscription bundles, and augmented reality. The firm designs its own software and semiconductors while working with subcontractors like Foxconn and TSMC to build its products and chips. Slightly less than half of Apple’s sales come directly through its flagship stores, with a majority of sales coming indirectly through partnerships and distribution.
