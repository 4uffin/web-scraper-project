Argus Quick Note: Weekly Stock List for 09/22/2025: Healthy Outlook for Aerospace & Defense
Aerospace & defense design and manufacturing is one of the core competencies of the U.S. economy, along with innovative technology, allocating capital, and pharmaceutical R&D. In our view, the sector is positioned for solid growth over the next few years. During 2025, global revenues for the total aerospace & defense industry are expected to grow by 6% from 2025 and reach $950 billion, as tracked by The Business Research Company. Looking ahead, industry forecasts call for the sector to grow at a CAGR of 5.8% and top $1.1 trillion by 2028. Drilling down, the recovering global airline industry bodes well for commercial aerospace demand over the next several years. Airline passenger levels and airline revenues are once again growing at a healthy pace, and with international markets reopened, we believe that the industry will be able to recover a substantial amount of its pre-COVID-19 revenues and profitability into 2026. We also expect solid military spending over the next few years. According to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, annualized federal spending on national defense was running at an $871 billion rate in 2Q25. That's up 6% year over year. On top of the country's typical strong commitment to defense spending, the budget has been influenced by the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine, the bombing in Iran, rising inflation, and other factors. We expect the current geopolitical environment to keep this type of spending high for some time to come. Here is a list of some of the aerospace & defense stocks that we like. Argus• 3 days ago
