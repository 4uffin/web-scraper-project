Stocks are higher at midday on Monday midday with the major indices up more
Stocks are higher at midday on Monday midday with the major indices up more than 1%, this as tensions seem to have cooled somewhat in the Middle East and the prices of oil and gold are pulling back from their spike on Friday. Meanwhile, the Fed meets this week. While there is little expectation for an interest-rate cut, Wall Street will take on a deep dive of the so-called 'dot plot,' which lays out the collective vision from Fed members of where they see interest rates down the road.
