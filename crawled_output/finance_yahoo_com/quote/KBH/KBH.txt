Trimming estimates after 'subdued' spring season
KB Home, headquartered in Los Angeles, is one of America's largest homebuilders, with domestic operations in California, Washington, Idaho, Arizona, Nevada, Colorado, Texas, Florida, and North Carolina. We expect the company to start building in Atlanta in the near future. In FY24, the company delivered 14,169 homes, generating revenue of $6.9 billion. The West Coast segment represented 42% of FY23 homebuilding revenue with just 30% of homes delivered, helped by an average home price of $679,300. The company targets the lower-middle portion of the market, with approximately half of sales to first-time buyers and another quarter to buyers making their first step-up from a starter home. Most of the homes the company sells are priced for the median-income household in that market, but KBH has also expanded into higher-priced markets. KBH's average selling price decreased 1% to $487,000 in FY24.
The company's fiscal year ends on November 30. Rating

Stocks are lower at midday on Friday. Why? Tariffs. Need we say more?
Stocks are lower at midday on Friday. Why? Tariffs. Need we say more? Reignited tariff talk, letters, financial press headlines, and 'involved country' responses are pushing most other topics below the fold these days and leading to the type of uncertainty that investors dislike. Meanwhile, the start of earnings season is here, with results from that exercise possibly making tariffs a lesser issue -- or possible making tariffs an even bigger issue if guidance from companies takes on a cautious 'tariff tone.'
