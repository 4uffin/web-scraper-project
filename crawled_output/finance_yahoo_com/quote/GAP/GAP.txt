Argus Quick Note: Weekly Stock List for 07/28/2025: Short-Term Trading Ideas
Many clients of Argus Research are long-term buy-and-hold investors. As such, our proprietary BUY-HOLD-SELL ratings and target prices are established with one-year time horizons. We also have five-year ratings for even longer-term investors and pension funds. But we also have hedge fund clients that are looking for trading opportunities or for long/short portfolio ideas. The first few months of 2025, with roller-coaster ups and downs in stock prices, likely provided more opportunities for momentum traders than for fundamental investors. The list below includes some of the shorter-term trading ideas our analysts and strategists have identified recently. All the stocks listed below are rated BUY at Argus.
