Argus Quick Note: Weekly Stock List for 09/08/2025: Companies Raising Guidance
During the recent earnings season, many companies across many sectors raised guidance. That is admirable, especially during uncertain economic times. We track the companies raising guidance and look for trends. Indeed, Management Signals is one of our Investment Themes for 2025. The sectors with the most companies raising guidance in the past quarter were Communication Services, Healthcare, Industrial, and Information Technology. Sectors underrepresented were Financial, Energy, and Consumer Staples. Raising guidance in the face of tariff and macroeconomic uncertainty could signal strong management, flexibility, and resilience. As well, increased guidance is often a catalyst for market-beating returns in the quarters ahead. The following is a partial list of companies in Argus' Fundamental Universe of Coverage at which management increased its outlook during the recent reporting season, with our rating and the sector designation noted. We like this theme, as it crosses numerous industries and generates a robust list of potential portfolio candidates. Argus• 14 days ago

Jobs Report Coming
The calendar has flipped to September and that
Jobs Report Coming The calendar has flipped to September and that means the August jobs report is due out on Friday. This is one of the last key reports before the Federal Reserve rate meeting later this month. Last week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500, and the Nasdaq were all down about 0.2%. year to date, the Dow is up 7%, the S&P 500 is higher by 10%, and the Nasdaq leads with a gain of 11%.
The earnings calendar this week includes Salesforce, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Dollar Tree, Campbell's, and Macy's reporting on Wednesday; Broadcom, Lululemon Athletica, and Ciena on Thursday; and Korn Ferry on Friday. Some 98% of S&P 500 companies have reported, with 13% growth in corporate earnings compared to the year-ago quarter. That is much better than was expected at the start of reporting season. Communication Services is leading, up 49%, while Energy, down 19%, is at the bottom. The focus of this week's economic calendar is the August jobs report. The consensus calls for Nonfarm Payrolls of 75,000, close to the result last month, and an uptick in the Unemployment Rate to 4.3%, from 4.2% in July. Meanwhile, Construction Spending and ISM Manufacturing will be reported on Tuesday; Job Openings and the Fed Beige Book are due out on Wednesday; and the ADP Employment Report and the U.S. Trade Deficit will be updated on Thursday. Turning to other data, the Atlanta Fed GDPNow measure calls for GDP of 2.2% in the third quarter. The Cleveland Fed Inflation Nowcast forecasts a 2.8% rate for CPI in August, suggesting higher prices. Mortgage rates ticked down slightly last week, with the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at 6.56%, according to FreddieMac. Gas prices rose three cents to an average of $3.15 per gallon for regular gas.
Looking ahead, the next Federal Reserve interest-rate decision comes on September 17, and odds have jumped to 87% for a cut, according to the CME FedWatch rate tool. After that, the next meeting is on October 29, when odds for a cut are at 95%.
Taking a deeper dive into performance, U.S. stocks are lagging global stocks. A leading industrialized global stock market index, the ETF EFA, has surged 21% year to date, while the leading emerging market ETF EEM has gained 19%. U.S. growth stocks, with a year-to-date gain of 10% (ETF IWF) have taken the edge over value stocks (ETF IWD), which have booked an advance of 9%. In other asset classes for the year to date, AGG bonds are up 2.5%, gold is up 35%, crude oil is down 10%, and Bitcoin is up 16%. The U.S. dollar is down 10%, tracking DXY. The VIX Volatility Index is at back at 15, below its historical average of 20. Sector performance reveals a mixed picture halfway through 2025. Communication Services leads all sectors with a 16.4% gain, followed by Industrials (+16%), then Information Technology (+14%), and Utilities (+13%), all outperforming the broader market. Defensive sectors like Consumer Staples (+6%) and Real Estate (+4%) cluster below the S&P 500's average return, while Consumer Discretionary (+2%), Energy (+2%), and Healthcare (flat) are at the bottom of the performance list.
