The major indices posted minor gains on Monday, July 21, but things were not
The major indices posted minor gains on Monday, July 21, but things were not pretty under the hood. Further, the market sold off in the afternoon, giving up most of its gains. While only one day, that type of action is not what the bulls want to see. Selling into strength is something that the smart money does very well, but those players don't want to make their defensive moves obvious and try to hide their distribution on an up day. We are rolling into earnings season with huge gains since the April bottom and it's possible that it may not be enough for companies to 'just' beat on earnings and raise guidance. Most of the recent big gainers on the S&P 500 have low relative strength. So we classify this as a low-quality rally. Beaten-up stocks, going into EPS season, have low expectations, so it's not hard to please Wall Street. Generally, these stocks have decent short positions, so any kind of decent news will get the shorts scrambling and taking profits.
Checking in on the S&P 500, we do not see much when it comes to technical trouble. The index has been riding its five-, 10-, and 13-day exponential averages higher since April 23. Every dip has been gobbled up, as more and more investors joined the bullish ranks. Remember, this has taken quite a bit of time in the context of one of the most hated rallies in memory.
While we still do not see a lot of technical red flags, we do note a bearish momentum divergence with respect to the daily moving-average convergence/divergence (MACD) on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100. There is also a minor S&P 500 divergence on the 14-day relative strength index. Argus• 2 months ago
