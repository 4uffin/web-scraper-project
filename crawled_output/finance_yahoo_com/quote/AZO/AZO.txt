Stocks rebounded yet again on Wednesday as the bulls and bears continue to take shots at each other.
Stocks rebounded yet again on Wednesday as the bulls and bears continue to take shots at each other. The S&P 500 rose 0.7%, the S&P 100 added 1%, the Nasdaq tacked on 1.2%, and the Nasdaq 100 was up 1.3%. The market benefited (greatly) from the mega caps in the trillion-dollar club, with AAPL popping 5%, AMZN ripping 4%, TSLA adding 3.6%, and AVGO tacking on 3%. When the "big guns" pop like that, it doesn't matter what the rest of the stock universe does.
On a sector level, Wednesday was a mixed day. Consumer Discretionary led with a 2.1% gain thanks to TSLA. Consumer Staples and Information Technology also had a good day. Poor old Healthcare was in the dumps again, falling 1.5%, with 0.8% to 1.1% losses in Materials, Energy, Utilities, and Real Estate. Many utility stocks have been on fire lately, as the sector continues to transfer from your father's stodgy old dividend stocks to something like growth stocks.
The S&P 500 and the S&P 100 have both stopped right at the key 61.8% retracement of the recent decline. When zeroing in on a one-hour chart, both indices appear to be working on three-wave, ABC advances since the August 1 intraday lows. The Nasdaq and QQQ have retraced a bit more than 61.8%. A three-wave rally would be considered a counter-trend move and would suggest another leg lower is in the cards. A reasonable S&P 500 target, if that plays out, would be 6,100.
Breadth has petered out since July 1, with the percentage of S&P 500 stocks above their 50-day average falling to 51% from 81% and the percentage above their 20-day falling to 43% from 82%. The percentage above their 200-day peaked at 68% on July 23, and has dropped to 57%. (Mark Arbeter, CMT) Argus• last month

'Worse-than-expected' margin pressure in fiscal 3Q25
AutoZone, Inc. is a retailer of aftermarket automotive parts and accessories and is the largest in the United States. Founded on July 4, 1979 (as Auto Shack), AutoZone currently has 7,516 stores across the United States, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Brazil, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The company is based in Memphis, Tennessee. Originally a division of Memphis-based wholesale grocer Malone & Hyde, the company was known as Auto Shack. After the sale of the grocery operation to the Fleming Companies of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, the name of the company was changed to AutoZone just prior to the company going public.
The company offers national brand and private-label products. According to management, more than 50% of the sales mix is private label. The margins on these private-label products are significantly higher than on branded products because AZO benefits from direct sourcing. The firm has approximately 125,000 employees and the shares are a component of the S&P 500. Rating
