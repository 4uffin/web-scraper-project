The major indices posted small gains on Monday as investors braced for key inflation news and some important software earnings reports.
The major indices posted small gains on Monday as investors braced for key inflation news and some important software earnings reports. Not surprisingly, corporate insiders have hit the sell button recently. Can you blame them after the rally we've had since the April low? Insiders can sell for many reasons, and some (maybe many) of these individuals have a large percentage of their wealth tied up in their company's stock. However, when the sell/buy ratios get out of hand, we take notice.
In recent weeks, insider-sentiment data from Vickers Stock Research suggests corporate insiders are "not feeling the love" for stocks. This week, that caution has jumped, as all of the one-week sell/buy ratios from Vickers have turned bearish. Is this caution because many stocks are at/near all-time highs? Based on a resurgence of tariff confusion? Because of a potentially weakening employment situation?
Whatever the cause(s), the numbers are clear. On a scale where anything above 6.00 is bearish, Vickers' Total One-Week Sell/Buy Ratio is now 7.70 versus 4.56 last week and 3.52 a month ago. Breaking that down, the NYSE one-week ratio is a worrisome 9.88 versus 6.00 last week and 3.07 a month ago, and the Nasdaq one-week ratio is 6.79 versus 3.84 last week and 4.14 a month ago. If the trend is your friend, that trend is not friendly.
Insider buying outpaced selling in the Consumer Staples sector over the past week, while selling outpaced buying in all other sectors. The greatest level of selling was in Information Technology, as stocks valued at $63 million were sold versus just $65,452 bought. (Mark Arbeter, CMT) Argus• 15 days ago
All the closet economists and interest-rate wonks are on the edge of their seats as the annual Jackson Hole Economic Symposium will kick off on Thursday.
All the closet economists and interest-rate wonks are on the edge of their seats as the annual Jackson Hole Economic Symposium will kick off on Thursday. The word crunchers will be busy trying to grab a few kernels of knowledge from Fed Chairman Powell about whether the FOMC will cut the fed funds rate at the September 17 meeting. Yes, all this excitement over a 25-basis-point (bps) cut in the funds rate. The CME FedWatch Tool is showing an 83% chance of a 25-bps cut next month and is leaning toward two cuts by the end of the year; the two-year Treasury yield is holding about 50 bps below the funds rate.
We are taking an expanded view of the bond market, as there is nothing of value in the short-term chart. In fact, the width of the weekly Bollinger Bands for the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT) has dropped to its lowest level since November 2021, right before a major drop in price. TLT traced out what appears to be a five-wave (we are not Elliott Wave experts) bear market from early 2020 until late 2023. At the bottom, weekly momentum posted a bullish divergence, and TLT responded with a very nice rally. As such, it looked like a possible bottom was in. But the rally failed, and price has dropped back toward the lows of late 2023. That is terrible action after the divergence and severe oversold condition.
We suspect that when bonds resolve their multi-year sideways pattern, prices will head to new bear-market lows, with yields at the longer end of the curve hitting new recovery highs. One thing to remember about the bond market is that trends tend to be extremely long. Indeed, the last bull market lasted from 1981 until 2020. (Mark Arbeter, CMT) Argus• last month
