Argus Quick Note: Weekly Stock List for 08/25/2025: Innovators in the Financial Sector
The Financial sector is active, with new business models, a heavy embrace of AI, small companies entering with innovative niches, and established players reworking divisions to be more competitive. It includes many companies that offer growth and value and that we believe should be included in diversified portfolios. Currently, we have an Over-Weight rating on the sector, which has great depth at about 14% of the S&P 500. At that size, there is a large pool of stocks from which to choose. The current landscape of the sector includes new fintech companies, many with profitability models prioritizing fees overs basis-point spreads. Many are focused on growth as opposed to balance sheets and dividends. Innovators include companies coming up with new payment-processing platforms, new insurance services, new ways to bank and complete financial transactions, and new ways to leverage AI. At a quick glance, the industry is using AI for financial planning, underwriting, trading, and fraud protection. In trading, AI algorithms analyze large sums of data and historical trends in order to recognize patterns and movements in the financial markets. The following is a list of BUY-rated Financial sector stocks that we consider to be innovators. We also note which are included in Argus theme model portfolios. Argus• 29 days ago
Monthly Review of Valuations
We have different ways of looking at market valuations, and most are signaling that stocks are reasonably valued, though not cheap. Our asset-allocation model, the Stock/Bond Barometer, is indicating that the two major portfolio asset classes are near parity on valuation. The model goes back to 1960 and takes into account real-time price levels, historical growth rates, and forward-looking forecasts of short- and long-term government and corporate fixed-income yields, inflation, stock prices, GDP, and corporate earnings, among other factors. The output is expressed in terms of standard deviations to the mean, or sigma. The mean reading from the model is a modest premium for stocks of 0.09 sigma, with a standard deviation of 1.05. So stocks normally sell for a slight premium valuation, which has been the case since inflation (and bond yields) jumped in 2022. The current valuation level is a 0.42 sigma premium for stocks, not a discount but easily within the normal range. Other valuation measures show reasonable multiples for stocks. The current forward P/E ratio for the S&P 500 is approximately 22, within the normal range of 15-24. On price/book, stocks are priced at the high end of the historical range of 5.3-1.8, given that IT stocks, which have low capital bases, are the biggest component of the market. On price/sales, the current ratio of 3.1 is above the historical average of 1.8, but well below the 4.0 multiple at the peak of the dot-com bubble. The current S&P 500 dividend yield of 1.20% is below the historical average of 2.9%, but the relative reading to the 10-year Treasury bond yield is 27% compared to the long-run average of 39% and the all-time low of 18% during 1999. Further, the gap between the S&P 500 earnings yield and the benchmark 10-year government bond yield is now 300 basis points, compared to the historical average of 400 basis points and nosebleed valuation levels of 200 basis points.
Lastly, the ratio of the S&P 500 price to an ounce of gold is 1.9, just below the midpoint of the historical range of 1-3. Argus• last month

Was there a potential character change in the stock market on July 28? Stock
Was there a potential character change in the stock market on July 28? Stock futures were higher on news about the U.S. trade deal with the EU. But by the time the market opened, those gains had been cut down to size. And by the end of the day, stocks were pretty much flat. So what is the answer to our above question? We don't have enough evidence based on a slightly negative reaction to seemingly good new. In addition, the market was facing many important data points over next few weeks, so anxiety was sure to be a little heightened -- especially with the market so stretched from early April.
Currently, one of the most frustrating markets is in the world of crypto. After hitting an intraday high of $123,220 on July 14, Bitcoin has gone sideways over the past 14 days, trading between $114,756 and $121,000. It has formed a small bullish wedge and bull flag and looked like it might either break out or break down a number of times. During the crypto currencies strong advance and last intermediate-term advance (in April and May 2025), price traced out three bullish flags that all lasted about 10 days. But not this time, as the waiting for this latest bull flag continues. Most of the other markets we follow have been surprisingly quiet in recent months (other than the continued strength in silver). Gold has gone nowhere in over three months, the 10-year Treasury yield is at the same level it was in September 2023, and crude oil (WTI) is at the same level it was going back to March 2023. Meanwhile, several bearish market developments have popped up, one of which we have talked about previously. The VIX Volatility Index appears to be tracing out a bullish wedge and it rose after hitting the lower trendline of the pattern. As well, the U.S. Dollar Index may finally be bottoming, something we have been expecting, and that could be a headwind for large, multinational stocks. Finally, the 21-day exponential moving average (EMA) CBOE equity-only put/call ratio has started to rise -- and that has a history, if it continues, of being bearish. Argus• last month
