Stocks are flat at Monday midday. Presidents Trump and Zelensky meet today to see if a peace agreement for Ukraine can be worked out. Walmart reports this week. The Fed travels to Jackson Hole for an economic summit. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note is 4.33%. Crude oil is at $63 per barrel. Argus• last month
This could be a key short-term period for the stock market.
This could be a key short-term period for the stock market. The S&P 500 (SPX) gapped higher on Thursday morning, but gave up all of its gains, a minor negative. The index filled the opening gap (and then some) before finishing flat, a minor positive. It's possible the index has traced out an ABC three-wave counter-trend rally, which would lead to the next leg lower. There are a number of supports below, with chart support at 6,200, the rising 50-day at 6,170, added chart support at 6,140, and the rising 21-week exponential moving average (EMA) at 6,035. It's also possible that the index is forming a base before another run to the upside.
The 5-day/13-day EMA is close to giving a sell signal. The SPX is coming off an extreme overbought condition, with multiple bearish divergences on the moving-average convergence/divergence (MACD). The 21-day rate of change (ROC) is close to cycling into negative territory, a short- to intermediate-term sell signal. Price volatility has picked up since the July 31 bearish reversal, which generally is not a good sign after a big advance.
Longer term, the S&P 500 has traded in a bull channel (other than in 2021, which was an overshoot, and just briefly during the pandemic). The SPX has approached the top channel line, and that could create a pause/pullback/correction. Rising and falling trendlines are drawn by chartists with a subjective eye, but ours seem to work well. Indeed, the trend is your friend until it isn't. Despite cries that the market has been too concentrated, the SPX advance-decline line broke out to all-time highs before the index did, and that generally is a bullish sign for at least the intermediate term. (Mark Arbeter, CMT) Argus• last month
The major indices have completed their second consecutive strong month following April's roller coaster ride.
The major indices have completed their second consecutive strong month following April's roller coaster ride. In June, the S&P 500 (SPX) was up 5.1%, the S&P 100 (OEX) 5.6%, the Invesco S&P 500 Top 50 (XLG) 6.2%, the Nasdaq 6.6%, and the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) 6.5%. For the second quarter, the SPX tacked on almost 11%, the OEX 12.4%, the XLG 13.7%, the Nasdaq 17.8%, and the QQQ 18%. With the higher-beta, higher-capitalization indices showing the most strength in the past month and in the past quarter, it's not hard to figure out that mega-cap Information Technology was back on top.
So has FOMO (fear of missing out) reached its peak with the major indices all cycling into overbought territory on a daily basis? Most likely not, as market sentiment still has not reached extreme optimism when we look at the indicators in aggregate.
Seasonality, a secondary or tertiary indicator in many technical books (including our book), tells us that we are entering one of the best months of the year and best months of a post-presidential election year. Over the past 20 Julys, the SPX is up 79% of the time, with an average gain of 2.5%. That gain is the highest of all months for the period. In post-election years, the SPX has risen 68% of the time in July, with an average gain of 2.5%. In the past nine years, the index is up in seven of those Julys. The Nasdaq is up in 75% of the past 20 Julys, with an average return of 4.2%, while the QQQ also is up 75% of the time, with an average gain of 4.4%. Other than November, July returns lead all other months. Those are high expectations after a great run! (Mark Arbeter, CMT) Argus• 2 months ago
