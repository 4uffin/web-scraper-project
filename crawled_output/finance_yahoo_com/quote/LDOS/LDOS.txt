The major indices did nothing last week, even with some blowout moves from mega-cap Information Technology.
The major indices did nothing last week, even with some blowout moves from mega-cap Information Technology. The S&P 500 and S&P 100 made minor all-time highs on Thursday, but had no follow-through on Friday. The S&P MidCap 400 (MDY) rose 0.8% while the S&P SmallCap 600 (SML) tacked on 0.4%. The mega-cap indices as well as the MDY continue to lose short-term momentum, and bearish daily divergences remain in place. The SML has not seen a momentum deterioration and is scorching the larger-cap indices with a 24-day rate-of-change that is almost 10%.
This week has its share of key news items, including August PPI on Wednesday, August CPI on Thursday, and September's preliminary read on consumer sentiment. It is a fairly big week for software, with ORCL, ADBE, and SNPS reporting quarterly results. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software ETF (IGV), with large weightings from ORCL, PLTR, MSFT, CRM, INTU, and NOW, has lagged both the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) and the Semiconductor stocks (SOXX) since May and has seen some big individual stock declines during 2025.
Treasury yields across the curve took a dive during the past three days on some Fedspeak as well as a weaker-than-expected August employment report. The 10-year yield fell 19 basis points (bps) to 4.09% and the five-year fell 16 bps to 3.58%. The two-year has dropped 27 bps since August 21 to 3.52%. The whole curve is testing the lows seen in April during the tariff tantrum. With the two-year at 3.5%, the Treasury market is indicating that the FOMC is now 75-100 bps behind in their cutting cycle, and that set the stage for an interesting interest-rate decision on September 17.

The stock market rallied again on Wednesday and, for a second straight day, small-caps led, mid-caps followed, and mega-caps lagged.
The stock market rallied again on Wednesday and, for a second straight day, small-caps led, mid-caps followed, and mega-caps lagged. Is this a developing trend? Possibly, but it is far too early to make that call. Every attempt by small-caps to take over leadership from the giants since August 2018 has failed miserably and thrown mud in the face of those (including us a time or two) calling for a rebirth of the little guys. There was one time when the small-caps led, and that was late 2020 until early 2021 when the stock market was still trying to recover from the pandemic. As such, that period is easy to dismiss.
The S&P 500 added 0.3% on Wednesday; the S&P 100, Nasdaq, and Nasdaq 100 were flat; the S&P Small Cap 600 (SML) popped 2.1%; and the S&P Mid Cap 400 rose 1.6%. Over the past two days, the SML has jumped an impressive 5.4%, the largest two-day sprint since stocks were coming out of the April bottom. The daily Vortex Indicator has given a buy signal, the CTM Trend Meter is showing nice strength (the highest reading since December 2024), the 21-day rate-of-change (ROC) is positive, the daily moving-average convergence/divergence (MACD) has turned higher, and the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) has broken a downtrend that started in early July.
Currently, 54% of SML stocks are above their 200-day average, the highest reading in six months. There was an uptick in small-cap volume over the past two days, with the above-average action leading to two accumulation days. Longer term, the SML chart remains a volatile mess, with the index in a trading range that goes back to late 2020. (Mark Arbeter, CMT) Argus• last month
The market won't be hurting for news this week, as we kick things off with seemingly positive news on the tariff front.
The market won't be hurting for news this week, as we kick things off with seemingly positive news on the tariff front. On Sunday, President Trump said that the U.S. has reached a trade deal with the European Union. Meanwhile, Wednesday features the FOMC's decision on interest rates. The market thinks the fed funds rate will remain in the 4.25% to 4.50% range. According to the CME FedWatch, there is a 62% chance of a 25-basis-point (bps) cut at the September 17 meeting and there may be another 25 bps cut by the end of the year. Elsewhere, earnings season remains in high gear, with MSFT and META reporting after the close on Wednesday and AMZN and AAPL after the close on Thursday.
Last week, the major indices enjoyed another good run and have risen in four of the past five weeks. The S&P 500 (SPX) rose 1.5%, the S&P 100 tacked on 1.4%, and the Nasdaq and Nasdaq 100 added 1%. The beaten-down Healthcare sector led last week, with a 3.5% gain. The Materials sector was up 2.4%, Industrials and Real Estate popped 2.3%, Financials added 1.7%, and Communication Services, Energy, and Consumer Discretionary rose between 1.2% and 1.4%. All 11 SPX sectors were up, with IT bringing up the rear with a 0.4% gain.
Back on May 13, when we raised our intermediate-term technical view to bullish, we said that the SPX had completed a 950-point reversal and, based on the reversal size, we projected a minimum measured move to 6,450-6,740, or 11%-15% higher. For the QQQ, we projected a minimum advance to 557-585, and that target range has been hit. Stocks are stretched from a price and time perspective, but it is very hard to argue with strong momentum.
