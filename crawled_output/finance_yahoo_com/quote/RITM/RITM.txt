Argus Quick Note: Weekly Stock List for 09/02/2025: Argus High-Yield Model Portfolio
Value stocks -- a market segment that includes high-yield stocks -- outperformed growth stocks in 2022. In early 2025, value stocks once again outperformed growth and remained on top for about six months. That's a recent rarity, as for the past decade-plus, the performance record has favored growth. Since 2015, the Russell 1000 Growth Index has climbed nearly 400%, compared to an advance of almost 100% for the Russell 1000 Value Index. The value sector is the place to achieve income. The current yield on the iShares Russell 1000 Value Index ETF is 1.9%, compared to the 0.4% current yield on the iShares Russell 1000 Growth Index ETF. For the Argus High-Yield Theme Model Portfolio, we seek new holdings that feature yields (at least) close to 3.0%. That moves us deep into the value segment of the market. When we look for attractive high-yield/deep-value stocks, we look for low valuations on metrics such as price/earnings, price/sales, price/book, yield, and price/ cash flow. We also look for companies with clean balance sheets, high levels of profitability, high-quality earnings, and experienced management teams. The current portfolio includes 30 BUY-rated stocks with a diversified representation in each of the 11 major sectors. The following is a partial list of the stocks in our High-Yield portfolio, with their current dividend yield. Argus• 17 days ago
The Argus High-Yield Model Portfolio
Value stocks -- a market segment that includes high-yield stocks -- outperformed growth stocks in 2022. In early 2025, value stocks once again outperformed growth and remained on top for about six months. That's a recent rarity, as for the past decade-plus, the performance record has favored growth. But the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines gave a lift to some of the cyclical companies (energy and regional banks) that had lagged, and value stocks outpaced growth stocks that year. While growth stocks have retaken the lead since 2023, the Federal Reserve continues to keep interest rates high to fend off inflation. This could possibly cap multiple expansion for growth companies in coming quarters. In any event, the value sector is the place to achieve income. Argus• 24 days ago
