A Slowing US Snacks Category Is Unlikely to Stifle Mars' Interest in a Deal With Kellanova
Following its split from the North American cereal business in October 2023, Kellanova (previously the global snacking arm of Kellogg) has operated as a leading global manufacturer and marketer of salty snacks, snack bars, frozen breakfast fare, meat alternatives, and other packaged foods. Its offerings are manufactured in around 20 countries and marketed in over 180. Its product mix includes well-known brands such as Pringles, Cheez-It, Rice Krispies Treats, Pop-Tarts, Eggo, Nutri-Grain, and Morningstar Farms. Sales beyond its home turf account for about two thirds of Kellanova's consolidated sales base. Mars is slated to acquire the recently independent business in a nearly $36 billion deal.
