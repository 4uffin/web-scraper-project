Large Cap US Pick List - September 2025
This pick list highlights constituents of the Morningstar US Large Cap Index that we believe offer investors the best risk-adjusted return prospects. Stocks of large-cap companies where neither growth nor value characteristics predominate. Stocks in the top 70% of the capitalization of the U.S. equity market are defined as large cap. Morningstar• 15 days ago
Stocks ended modestly higher on Tuesday, with anxiety high ahead of quarterly numbers from Nvidia and the next key inflation reading (the PCE report).
Stocks ended modestly higher on Tuesday, with anxiety high ahead of quarterly numbers from Nvidia and the next key inflation reading (the PCE report). In addition, many investors seem confused (and for good reason) about what the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will do after their expected 25-basis-point cut on September 17. Will it be "one and done" or is this the start of a series of rate cuts going out into 2026?
Based on history, it seems strange to us (and apparently others) that the FOMC might be cutting rates with the major stock indices at record highs. But the stock market and the economy have become almost two separate forces, with the mega-caps storming higher due to the AI explosion, while the real economy is merely muddling along. There is a massive disconnect between the performance of the major indices and the nation's GDP. That has many investors scratching their heads.
The S&P 500 rose 0.4% on Tuesday, missing another new high by just one point; the S&P 100 added 0.5%; and both the Nasdaq and Nasdaq 100 rallied 0.4%. Trading volume on the major indices was very slow for a second straight day, as we are firmly in the "dog days of summer." Looking to next week, we note that September (historically) is the worst month of the year for stocks. Many are expecting a jump in volatility and a pullback in stocks. But perhaps share prices will just keep pushing higher. We admit that we don't have a firm technical grasp on what stocks will do in the near-term -- but leaving it up to seasonals is just not good enough. (Mark Arbeter, CMT) Argus• 28 days ago

The calming of insider-sentiment signals in the weekly data from Vickers Stock
The calming of insider-sentiment signals in the weekly data from Vickers Stock Research has continued for a second week. The one-week sentiment data from Vickers is neutral for all indices and the eight-week data has improved across the board, albeit with a mixed overall stance. The NYSE Eight-Week Sell/Buy Ratio has improved but is still bearish (for a third week). The Nasdaq Eight-Week Sell/Buy Ratio has improved and remains neutral, having come very close to a bearish crossover but never having actually made it. And the Total (all exchanges) eight-week ratio has slipped back into neutral territory after one week in the bearish zone. As we said last week, all insider-sentiment roads point towards neutral, but any thought of bullish insider sentiment remains off the table currently. Meanwhile, the volume of insider transactions is growing as restrictions on insider trading fade with the end of earnings season. Insider selling outpaced insider buying across all sectors over the past week. The greatest level of selling occurred in the Information Technology sector, with shares valued at $304 million sold by insiders versus $50 million bought. Selling activity was also of note in the Industrial sector, with shares valued at $262 million sold versus $34 million bought, as well as in Consumer Discretionary, Healthcare, and Financials.
This week, analysts at Vickers highlighted insider transactions of interest at The Carlyle Group Inc. (NGS: CG) and Mirion Technologies Inc. (NYSE: MIR). Argus• last month
