Last week in this space, we wrote about the increase in Middle East tensions
Last week in this space, we wrote about the increase in Middle East tensions that hit the tape on Friday, June 13. We noted that the event came late in that trading week, allowing insiders little time to react.
This week, the data from Vickers Stock Research clearly suggests increasing caution from insiders after the geopolitical development. Vickers' Total Eight-Week Sell/Buy Ratio (the broadest measure of insider sentiment) has deteriorated week over week. Drilling further, the weakness is most pronounced in the Nasdaq data, where the one-week reading
has crossed over the border between neutral (below 6.00) and bearish (above 6.00), logging in at 6.18. Yet the data from Vickers had been weakening for over a month and simply dropped even more on the latest news. That reminds us that insiders saw 'near all-time high' stock prices as vulnerable even before the Mideast reignited. And none of the above takes into account this week's 'new news,' coming in the form of growing U.S. involvement in the conflict. Again, insiders already told us that stocks were vulnerable to worrisome news -- and now the bad news department is working overtime. While insider selling outpaced insider buying across all industries last week, the gap was not as pronounced in the Energy sector, with insiders selling just 1.18-times more than they bought. Conversely, selling far outpaced insider buying in Information Technology, with shares valued at $78 million sold versus just $309,999 bought. Selling was also notable in Consumer Staples.
This week, analysts at Vickers highlighted insider transactions of interest at Casey's General Stores Inc. (NGS: CASY) and Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE: DELL). Argus• 2 months ago
Argus Quick Note: Weekly Stock List for 06/23/2025: Sustainable Growth Companies
Argus Research believes that Sustainable Impact Investing can be smart investing. This month, we updated our Sustainable Growth Model Portfolio and added eight companies. That's a big number. We did research, screened stocks in multiple ways, and analyzed metrics to give us confidence about what companies deserve a spot in this portfolio. Companies committed to Sustainable Impact values reflect management traits that often translate into better business. According to the Global Sustainable Investment Association, global assets under management in Sustainable Impact or ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) strategies were $30 trillion in 2022, up from $23 trillion in 2016. The discipline, originally known as Socially Responsible Investing, focused at first on excluding companies that conducted business in South Africa, or participated in industries such as tobacco, alcohol, and firearms. In time, the list of industries to avoid increased to include soft drinks, fast food, and oil and gas, among numerous others. But performance of these initial strategies lagged. Now, instead of merely identifying industries to avoid, the discipline promotes "sustainable" business practices across industries that have an "impact" on global issues such as the climate, hunger, poverty, disease, shelter, and workers' rights.
At Argus, we track progress at specific companies as part of our Management Analysis -- one of the six points in our proprietary Six-Point Fundamental System. In addition to reviewing and measuring the Sustainable/ESG proclamations from companies under coverage, we partner with an ESG research firm, JUST Capital, and leverage its analysis and insights. JUST Capital's mission is to drive measurable corporate change to create a stakeholder-centric form of capitalism that reflects the priorities of the American public. JUST utilizes a combination of data-driven research and strategic engagement in an attempt to shift norms and practices in corporate America and the financial markets. JUST ESG Custom Ratings rank stocks in the Russell 1000 on criteria using a scale of 1-100. Drawing on the JUST Capital rankings, we compiled lists of companies followed by Argus Research that are in position to have a "sustainable impact" on the environment, workplace, community, and marketplace. These firms have exemplary records not only in delivering on the bottom line, but also in improving the environment, contributing to community relations, and showing respect for their employees. Here are some of the stocks that are currently in the Argus Sustainable Growth Model Portfolio. Argus• 2 months ago
