Argus Quick Note: Weekly Stock List for 06/02/2025: Companies Raising Guidance
This first-quarter earnings season has had a special tone. As usual, many companies have offered guidance. But they also have increasingly focused on the economy, tariffs, and overall uncertainty. On tariffs specifically, managements are detailing any likely impact on profits and any plans to pass price hikes on to customers and/or consumers. Our team of analysts is factoring all this fresh data into sector outlooks, earnings forecasts, and investment ratings. We track the list of companies raising guidance, and this quarter that list often features companies in sectors such as Communication Services, Consumer Discretionary, Consumer Staples, Healthcare, Industrial, and Information Technology. Often missing are companies the Financials, Energy, and Materials sectors. Companies that are still able to raise guidance despite the tariff and macroeconomic uncertainty could feature managements that have flexibility in a changing environment, and that is often a catalyst for market-beating returns. Indeed, "Management Signals" is one of our Investment Themes for 2025. The following is a list of some of the companies in our Fundamental Universe of Coverage where management recently increased guidance.

The stock market stalled last week after an impressive run that saw the S&P
The stock market stalled last week after an impressive run that saw the S&P 500 bolt from 4982 in late April to 5659 at the close on Friday. Insider sentiment moved mostly in lock-step with that surge, though the insider-sentiment data from Vickers Stock Research turned bullish during the week of April 7, ahead of the market's bullish run.
Last week, insider-sentiment again mirrored the broader market by 'stalling' but not fading. On a scale where sentiment is bullish under 2.00 and neutral from 2.00 to 6.00, the NYSE Eight-Week Sell/Buy Ratio from Vickers is now 2.01 versus 1.83 last week, representing a slight fallback. For the Nasdaq, there was some improvement, with the Nasdaq Eight-Week Sell/Buy Ratio at 2.87 this week versus 2.98 last week. Putting all the data together, Vickers' Total (all exchanges) Eight-Week Sell/Buy Ratio is currently 2.39, essentially unchanged from 2.34 last week. So insider sentiment stalled, but in a pretty positive place. Insider selling outpaced insider buying across all sectors over the last week, but insider buying in the Consumer Discretionary sector lagged selling by a factor of just 2.0-times. Selling was the greatest in Consumer Staples over the last week, with shares valued at $111 million sold versus just $2 million bought. Selling was also notable in Financials, with shares valued at $99 million sold versus just $5 million bought, as well as Healthcare, where insiders sold shares valued at $97 million versus $7 million bought.
This week, analysts at Vickers highlighted insider transactions of interest at CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (NGS: CRWD) and GoDaddy Inc. (NYSE: GDDY).
