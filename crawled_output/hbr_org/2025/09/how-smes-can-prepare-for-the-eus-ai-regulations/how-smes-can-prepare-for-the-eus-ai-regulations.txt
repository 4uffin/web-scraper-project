You receive hundreds of resumes for each job opening, often more than 500 for a single position. Your small HR team cannot possibly review them all thoroughly, so you have implemented an in-house CV screening system powered by AI. This tool, based on a publicly available, open-weight foundation model and further trained on the resumes of past successful hires, helps identify promising candidates by assessing their skills, experience, and fit.Anselm Küsters
