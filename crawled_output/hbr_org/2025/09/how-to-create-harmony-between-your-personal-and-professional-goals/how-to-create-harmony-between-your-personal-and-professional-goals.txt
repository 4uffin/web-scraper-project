Following the early death of her husband, Pierre Curie, she raised two young girls, then just one- and eight-years old, on her own. Was she torn between her roles as a scientist and a single mother? Perhaps. Yet we believe it is also possible that she experienced these roles as coexisting in harmony, introducing her daughters to her world of science. The result? Her eldest went on to win a Nobel Prize in chemistry, too.Jiabi Wang
