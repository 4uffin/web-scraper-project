Oral Arguments
The Court holds oral argument in about 70-80 cases each year. The arguments are an opportunity for the Justices to ask questions directly of the attorneys
representing the parties to the case, and for the attorneys to highlight arguments that they view as particularly important. Arguments are generally
scheduled on specified Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday mornings beginning on the first Monday in October, and continuing through the end of April. Typically,
the Court holds two arguments each day beginning at 10:00 a.m. The days on which arguments are held are identified on the
Court’s yearly calendar. The specific cases to be argued each day, and the attorneys scheduled to
argue them, are identified on hearing lists for each session and on
the day call for each argument session.
The Court is currently conducting a pilot program in which members of the public may apply for Courtroom seating through an online lottery. During this pilot program, Courtroom seating will also be available
to the public on a first-come, first-seated basis.
An audio feed of the argument is live-streamed on the Court's website, and the Court posts the audio later in the day.
On the afternoon of each argument, the Court posts transcripts of that day’s arguments.
