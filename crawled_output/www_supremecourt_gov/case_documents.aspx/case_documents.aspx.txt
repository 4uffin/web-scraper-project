Case Documents
The Court makes available many different forms of information about cases. The most common way to find information about a case is to review the case’s docket -- a list of all of the filings and rulings in that case, arranged in chronological order. The docket also includes links to electronic images of most filings submitted to the court after November 13, 2017. To locate the docket for a particular case through a docket search, enter either the docket number for the case (e.g., 16-1523), or the names of one or more parties, or attorneys in the case. You can also sign up to receive email notifications of activity in a case by clicking on the envelope icon on the docket page for that case.
The Court regularly issues orders in connection with cases. In contrast with opinions, orders are short rulings, usually resolving motions or petitions in a summary fashion. The most common type of order that the Court issues simply provides that "The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied" or "The petition for a writ of certiorari is granted." Between October and June, the Court often issues order lists on Monday mornings, resolving a large number of petitions and motions that were considered by the Justices the previous week. The Court also issues miscellaneous orders at other times when the need arises. Granted/Noted Cases Lists identify all of the cases that the Court has decided to resolve on the merits in a given Term, either by granting a petition for a writ of certiorari or by noting probable jurisdiction over an appeal. And the Court’s Journal reflects all of the official actions that the Court takes - including orders, opinions, oral arguments, and admissions to the Court’s Bar.
