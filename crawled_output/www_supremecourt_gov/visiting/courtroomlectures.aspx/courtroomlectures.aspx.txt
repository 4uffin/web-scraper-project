Courtroom Lectures
Courtroom Lectures introduce visitors of all ages to the judicial functions of the Supreme Court, the history of the building, and the architecture of the Courtroom. Trained volunteer docents and interns lead these 25-minute programs, which take place entirely inside the Courtroom. Other than attending a Court session, Courtroom Lectures are the only way visitors may enter the Courtroom.
Lecture are typically offered at 10:30 a.m., 11:30 a.m., 12:30 p.m., 1:30 p.m., and 2:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, with the exception of federal holidays and days when the Court is in session. Because lectures take place inside the Courtroom, they are subject to cancellation due to Court business and are subject to volunteer docent availability. For the most-up-to-date information about the lecture schedule, please refer to the rolling calendar below. Click on a day to view lectures scheduled within the next 30 days.
The lecture line forms in the Great Hall, directly outside the Courtroom, on the first floor. Particularly in the spring and summer months, we recommend joining the line at least 15 minutes prior to the lecture’s start time. Please be on time, as late entries are disruptive to both the presenter and audience and cannot be accommodated.
