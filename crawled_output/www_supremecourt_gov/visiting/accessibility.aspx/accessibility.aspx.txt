Visitors Who Use Wheelchairs or Other Mobility Devices
An accessible entrance and exit is located along Maryland Avenue on the left side of the building. Limited accessible parking is also available along Maryland Avenue.
A limited number of wheelchairs are available free of charge at your point of entry. Wheelchairs may be obtained from any Supreme Court Police Officer.
Elevators are available on the ground floor and first floor to provide access to all public areas.
Visitors Who are Deaf or Hard of Hearing
Assistive listening devices are available when Court is in session. A hearing loop (induction loop), is installed in the Courtroom, requiring the use of a
compatible device. Listening devices for use of the loop are available upon request for visitors who do not have hearing aids or compatible hearing aids. All
listening devices may be obtained from a Supreme Court Police Officer or Courtroom attendant as you are being seated. The hearing loop is also available
for Courtroom Lectures. The hearing loop system for Courtroom Lectures transmits sound through an electromagnetic signal that is picked up by most hearing
aids and cochlear devices without requiring additional equipment.
American Sign Language interpretation for Courtroom Lectures can be arranged with at least seven business days’ notice. Please
email us.
