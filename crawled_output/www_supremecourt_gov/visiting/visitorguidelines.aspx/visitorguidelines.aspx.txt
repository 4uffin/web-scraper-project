For the safety and protection of all staff, visitors, and the historic collection objects on display, the following

Please Use Quiet Voices
As a courtesy to other visitors and to staff members who may be working in nearby offices, please use quiet
voices while visiting.
Photography & Video
Visitors may take non-flash photographs and videos for personal use in the public portions of the ground and
first floors. Photography and audio/video recording is not permitted inside the Courtroom at any time.
The use of drones or other unmanned aerial devices is prohibited on the grounds of the Supreme Court Building.
No Smoking
Smoking, including the use of e-cigarette products, is prohibited inside the building.
No Food and Drink
Visitors may not bring food and beverages (including bottled water) inside the building. See Prohibited Items.
Eating and drinking is permitted only in the Café and in the vending machine alcove located on the ground
floor.
Please Don’t Touch
Touching of the John Marshall statue, portraits, busts, or other artifacts on exhibit is strictly prohibited. The oils
and dirt on our hands can cause serious damage to the surface of collection objects.
