Argument Days:
The Court convenes for a session in the Courtroom at 10 a.m. The session may begin with the announcement of opinions - decisions
in argued cases – followed by the swearing in of new members to the Bar of the Supreme Court. Unless otherwise noted, the Court generally hears
two, one-hour oral arguments, with attorneys for each side of a case given 30 minutes to make a presentation to the Court and answer questions
posed by the Justices. These sessions are open to the public.
Non-argument Days:
The Court convenes for a session in the Courtroom at 10 a.m. The session begins with the announcement of opinions - decisions
in argued cases - followed by the swearing in of new members to the Bar of the Supreme Court. These sessions, which typically last 15-30 minutes,
are open to the public.
Conference Days:
The Justices meet in a private conference to discuss cases argued earlier that week. The Justices also discuss and vote on petitions
for review. The building is open to the public but the Justices do not take the Bench.
Holiday:
The Court is closed on federal holidays. For questions on how the holiday impacts case filings, contact the Clerk’s Office.
