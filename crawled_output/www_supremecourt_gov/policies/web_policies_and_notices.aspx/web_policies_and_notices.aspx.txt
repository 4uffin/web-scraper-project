Website Policies and Notices
The Supreme Court may provide links to both government-owned or sponsored and commercial websites. Links to outside websites are offered at the sole discretion and determination of the Supreme Court. The webmaster and associated staff evaluate all suggested links and use the following customary standards to determine the necessity and/or applicability of the suggested link:
Is the recommended website a government-owned or supported website?
Does the website provide official government information or services as they relate to the core mission of the Supreme Court?
Is the recommended website accurate, current, readily accessible, applicable to wide audiences, and "user-friendly"?
Is the website's recognition of security and privacy practices consistent with established government security and privacy policies?
Links to Government Websites
The Supreme Court may provide links to various federal government-owned or sponsored websites unless specifically directed not to by the associated site administrator or agency official. Links supplied by the Supreme Court for federal government-owned websites generally apply ".gov", ".mil" and ".fed.us" domains; however, some quasi-government agency websites created by public sector/private sector partnerships, state and local government sites, and various government-sponsored websites may use domains ending in ".com", ".org", or ".net".
Links to Non-Government Websites
The Supreme Court may occasionally provide links to websites not owned or sponsored by the federal government. These links are only provided as a public service and are designed to offer users with additional government information or services that may not otherwise be found on official government websites. Links to websites offering commercial products or services are provided solely for the convenience of the user. The Supreme Court neither endorses nor guarantees in any way the external organizations, services, advice, or products included in associated web links. Furthermore, the Supreme Court neither controls nor guarantees the accuracy, relevance, timeliness, or completeness of the information contained in non-government owned website links.
Disclaimer of Endorsement
The information posted on www.supremecourt.gov may include hypertext links and/or pointers to information or services created and maintained by other public and/or private organizations. The Supreme Court provides these links solely for users information and convenience. Users acknowledge that when selecting a link to an outside website, they are leaving www.supremecourt.gov and are subject to the privacy and security policies of the owners/sponsors of the outside website.
In addition, the Supreme Court does not control or guarantee the accuracy, relevance, timeliness or completeness of information contained on or within associated links.
The Supreme Court does not endorse the organizations sponsoring linked websites and does not endorse the views they express or the products/services they offer.
The Supreme Court cannot authorize the use of copyrighted materials contained in linked websites. Users must request such authorization from the sponsor of the linked website.
The Supreme Court does not guarantee that non-government owned websites comply with accessibility requirements, privacy standards, or security practices.
Security/Monitoring Notice
For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, this government computer system employs software programs to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage. Anyone using this system expressly consents to such monitoring and is advised that if such monitoring reveals evidence of possible abuse or criminal activity, such evidence may be provided to appropriate law enforcement officials. With the exception of authorized law enforcement investigations, no other attempts are made to identify individual users or their usage habits. Raw data logs are used for no other purposes and are scheduled for regular destruction. Unauthorized attempts to upload or change information on this service are strictly prohibited and may be punishable by law, including the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act of 1996.
Gifts & Items Sent to the Supreme Court
Due to the nature of the Supreme Court and its regular interaction and correspondence with government officials, bar members, commercial businesses, and the general public, the Supreme Court and its staff are often the recipients of gifts of a personal or professional nature. Although the Supreme Court appreciates these efforts, senders must understand that all items addressed to the Court follow a strict security screening process, in which delivered goods may be considerably delayed or damaged. Therefore, senders are encouraged to avoid sending items of a personal nature as they may not be returned. In addition, due to security risks, the Supreme Court will not accept perishable or consumable gifts sent to the Supreme Court or its staff.
