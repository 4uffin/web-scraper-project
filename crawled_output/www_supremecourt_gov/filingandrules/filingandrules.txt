Supreme Court Bar
Filing and Rules
The Court’s Rules and various forms of guidance to filers can be obtained on the "Rules and Guidance” page. The Court’s Rules are formally adopted by the Court, and set forth in detail the requirements for all filings and the procedures that the Court will apply to the resolution of cases. The Clerk’s Office also issues guidance to assist filers.
For example, the “Guide for Filing In Forma Pauperis Cases” provides practical assistance to litigants who may not have the financial resources to pay the Court’s filing fee or to submit booklet-format documents under Court Rule 33.1.
The “Supreme Court Bar” page provides information to attorneys who may wish to seek admission to the Court’s Bar.
Included on this page are instructions for individual and group admissions, both on written motion and in open Court, and the form that must be completed for all applicants.
