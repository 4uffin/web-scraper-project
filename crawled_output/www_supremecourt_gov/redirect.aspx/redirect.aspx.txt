Anchors Aweigh!
Charles Evans Hughes held several government positions between his two tenures on the Supreme Court. While serving as secretary of state from 1921 to 1925, Hughes led a diplomatic mission to Brazil to attend an exposition celebrating the centennial of the nation’s independence. After a nearly 5,000-mile journey aboard the ocean liner Pan American, the American delegation transferred to the USS Maryland and entered Rio de Janeiro’s harbor on September 6, 1922, receiving salutes from ships of the other participating nations along the way. The party attended the opening celebration of the Centennial Exposition, where Secretary Hughes was presented with a gold medal and a certificate naming him a “Special Ambassador” to the exposition.

The reverse of the medal depicts Prince Pedro I rallying his troops, which is likely inspired by a painting by Pedro Américo entitled Independence or Death. Relief portraits of the “Founding Fathers” of Brazilian independence are also featured on the medal. From left to right: José Bonifácio de Andrada e Silva, Martim Francisco Ribeiro de Andrada, Antônio Carlos Ribeiro de Andrada [Machado e Silva], and Joaquim Gonçalves Ledo.
