Journal
The Journal of the Supreme Court of the United States contains the official minutes of the Court. It is published chronologically for each day the Court
issues orders or opinions or holds oral argument. The Journal reflects the disposition of each case, names the court whose judgment is under review, lists
the cases argued that day and the attorneys who presented oral argument, contains miscellaneous announcements by the Chief Justice from the Bench, and sets
forth the names of attorneys admitted to the Bar of the Supreme Court. It does not contain opinions of the Court, which are published in the United States
Reports and in the "Opinions" section of this website.
New Journal entries are posted on this website about two weeks after the event.
