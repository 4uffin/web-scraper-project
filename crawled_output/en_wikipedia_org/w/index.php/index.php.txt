SMS Rheinland was one of four Nassau-class battleships, the first dreadnoughts built for the Imperial German Navy and launched on September 26, 1908. Her service with the High Seas Fleet during World War I included fleet advances into the North Sea, some in support of raids by I Scouting Group as well as the Battle of Jutland, in which Rheinland was engaged by British destroyers. The ship also saw duty in the Baltic Sea during the Battle of the Gulf of Riga. She returned to the Baltic as the core of an expeditionary force to aid the White Finns in the Finnish Civil War in 1918, but ran aground. The damage done by the grounding was too severe and Rheinland was decommissioned to be used as a barracks ship for the remainder of the war. In 1919, following the scuttling of the German fleet at Scapa Flow, Rheinland was ceded to the Allies who, in turn, sold the vessel to ship breakers in the Netherlands to eventually be broken up to scrap metal. (This article is part of a featured topic: Battleships of Germany.)

Today's featured picture
Voss is the seventeenth collection by British fashion designer Alexander McQueen. It had its runway show on 26 September 2000 at the Gatliff Road Warehouse in London, and was created for the Spring/Summer 2001 season of McQueen's eponymous fashion house. The collection draws on imagery of madness and the natural world to explore ideas of bodily perfection, interrogating who and what was beautiful. Voss features a large number of showpiece designs, including dresses made with razor clam shells, an antique Japanese screen, taxidermy hawks, and microscope slides. The collection's palette mainly comprises muted tones; common design flourishes included Orientalist and surrealist elements. This photograph shows the razor clam shell dress at the 2024 Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
