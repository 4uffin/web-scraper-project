2022 invasion
prelude
Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, starting the biggest war in Europe since World War II and dramatically expanding the existing war between the two countries.[6] The invasion formed the first phase of the war, ending by April 2022, by which time the invasion's initial goal of a rapid victory had failed, with Ukraine successfully pushing back the northern arm of the invasion and preventing the capture of Kyiv.[7]
Russian president Vladimir Putin declared the invasion a "special military operation", saying that it was to support the Russian-backed breakaway republics of Donetsk and Luhansk, whose paramilitary forces had been fighting Ukraine in the war in Donbas since 2014. Putin espoused irredentist and imperialist views challenging Ukraine's legitimacy as a state, baselessly claimed that the Ukrainian government were neo-Nazis committing genocide against the Russian minority in the Donbas, and said that Russia's goal was to "demilitarise and denazify" Ukraine.[8][9][10][11]
In late 2021, Russia massed troops near Ukraine's borders and issued demands to the West including a ban on Ukraine ever joining the NATO military alliance.[12] After repeatedly denying having plans to attack Ukraine, on 24 February 2022, Russian air strikes and a ground invasion were launched on a northern front from Belarus towards the capital Kyiv, a southern front from Crimea, and an eastern front from the Donbas and towards Kharkiv. Ukraine enacted martial law, ordered a general mobilisation, and severed diplomatic relations with Russia.
Russia's invasion plan involved defeating Ukraine within ten days and capturing or killing its government, followed by "mopping up" operations, establishing filtration camps for Ukrainians, setting up occupation regimes, trying and executing people involved in the Revolution of Dignity, and annexation.[13][14][15][16] Whilst the invasion failed its main goal of a rapid victory, as Ukraine successfully pushed back the northern arm of the invasion and prevented the capture of Kyiv, Russia successfully maintained a military occupation of the southeast of Ukraine, and several months after the invasion unilaterally declared the annexation of four Ukrainian oblasts.
The invasion was met with widespread international condemnation. The United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution condemning the invasion and demanding a full Russian withdrawal. The International Court of Justice ordered Russia to halt military operations, and the Council of Europe expelled Russia. Many countries imposed sanctions on Russia and its ally Belarus and provided humanitarian and military aid to Ukraine. Protests occurred around the world, with anti-war protesters in Russia being met by mass arrests and greater media censorship. The International Criminal Court (ICC) opened an investigation into crimes against humanity, war crimes, abduction of Ukrainian children, and genocide against Ukrainians. The ICC issued arrest warrants for Putin and other Russian officials.
Background
Further information: Russo-Ukrainian War
Ukraine, with the annexed Crimea in the south and two Russia-backed separatist republics in Donbas in the east up to the 2022 invasion
In 2013, Ukraine's parliament overwhelmingly approved finalising an association agreement with the European Union (EU),[17] which had been negotiated for several years. Russia put pressure on Ukraine to reject the agreement and imposed economic sanctions on the country.[18] Kremlin adviser Sergei Glazyev warned in September 2013 that if Ukraine signed the EU agreement, Russia would no longer acknowledge Ukraine's borders.[19]
In November, Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych suddenly withdrew from signing the agreement,[20] choosing closer ties to the Russian-led Eurasian Economic Union instead. This coerced withdrawal triggered a wave of protests known as Euromaidan, culminating in the Revolution of Dignity in February 2014. Almost 100 protesters were killed. Despite signing an agreement, Yanukovych fled. Parliament voted to remove him and he ended up in Russia.
Russian soldiers with no insignia occupied the Ukrainian territory of Crimea, and seized the Crimean Parliament.[21] Russia annexed Crimea in March 2014, after a widely disputed referendum held under occupation. Pro-Russian protests immediately followed in the Ukrainian cities of Donetsk and Luhansk. The war in Donbas began in April 2014 when armed Russian mercenaries led by Igor 'Strelkov' Girkin seized Sloviansk and nearby towns.[22][23][24] Russian troops were covertly involved in the fighting.[25] The Minsk agreements, signed in September 2014 and February 2015, aimed to resolve the conflict, but ceasefires and further negotiations repeatedly failed.[26]
Prelude
Main articles: Prelude to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and Ukraine–NATO relations § Russian opposition to Ukrainian NATO membership
Russian military build-up around Ukraine as of 3 December 2021
Rise in tensions
There was a large Russian military build-up near Ukraine's borders in March and April 2021,[27] and again in both Russia and Belarus from October 2021 onward.[28] Members of the Russian government, including Putin, denied having plans to attack or invade Ukraine up until the day before the invasion.[29][30][31]
While Russian troops massed on Ukraine's borders, Russia's proxy forces launched thousands of attacks on Ukrainian forces in the Donbas.[32] Observers from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), which also includes Ukraine and Russia, reported more than 90,000 ceasefire violations throughout 2021; the vast majority in Russian-controlled territory.[33]
In July 2021, Putin published an essay "On the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians", in which he called Ukraine "historically Russian lands" and claimed there is "no historical basis" for the "idea of Ukrainian people as a nation separate from the Russians".[34][35]
Meeting of the NATO-Russia Council on 12 January 2022
In December 2021, Russia issued an ultimatum to the West, which included demands that NATO end all activity in its Eastern European member states and ban Ukraine or any former Soviet state from ever joining the alliance.[12][36] Russia's government said NATO was a threat and warned of a military response if it followed an "aggressive line".[37] NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg replied that "Russia has no say" on whether Ukraine joins, and "has no right to establish a sphere of influence to try to control their neighbours".[38] NATO offered to improve communication with Russia, and to negotiate limits on missile placements and military exercises, provided Russia withdrew its troops from Ukraine's borders,[39] but Russia did not do so.
Buildup (February 2022)
Further information: Timeline of the war in Donbas (2022)
Western leaders vowed that heavy sanctions would be imposed should Putin choose to invade rather than to negotiate.[40] French President Emmanuel Macron[41] and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz met Putin in February 2022 to dissuade him from an invasion. According to Scholz, Putin told him that Ukraine should not be an independent state.[42] Scholz told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to declare Ukraine a neutral country and renounce its aspirations to join NATO. Zelenskyy replied that Putin could not be trusted to abide by such a settlement.[43] Ukraine had been a neutral country in 2014 when Russia occupied Crimea and invaded the Donbas.[44][45]
Ukrainian president Zelenskyy declared that 16 February, a speculated date for the invasion, would be a "Day of Unity".[46][47] On 19 February, Zelenskyy made a speech at the Munich Security Conference, calling for Western powers to drop their policy of "appeasement" towards Moscow and give a clear time-frame for when Ukraine could join NATO.[48] Political analysts Taras Kuzio and Vladimir Socor agree that "when Russia made its decision to invade Ukraine, that country was more remote than ever not only from NATO membership but from any track that might lead to membership".[49]
Putin questioned the legitimacy of the Ukrainian state. In a 21 February speech,[50] he repeated an inaccurate claim that "Ukraine never had a tradition of genuine statehood"[51] and incorrectly described the country as having been created by Soviet Russia. Putin falsely accused Ukrainian society and government of being dominated by neo-Nazism, invoking the history of collaboration in German-occupied Ukraine during World War II.[52][53] The US Holocaust Memorial Museum and Yad Vashem condemned the abuse of Holocaust history and the use of comparisons with Nazi ideology for propaganda.[54][55]
Putin and his long-time confidant Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu[56]
Fighting in Donbas escalated after 17 February 2022.[57] The Ukrainians and the Russian separatists accused one another of firing into their respective territories.[58][59] On 18 February, the Donetsk and Luhansk people's republics ordered all civilians to leave their capitals,[60][61][62] although observers noted that full evacuations would take months.[63] Ukrainian media reported a sharp increase in artillery shelling by the Russian-led militants in Donbas as an attempt to provoke the Ukrainian army.[64][65]
In the days leading up to the invasion, the Russian government intensified a disinformation campaign intended to mute public criticism. Russian state media promoted fabricated videos—many amateur in quality[66][67]—that purported to show Ukrainian forces attacking Russians in Donbas; evidence showed that the claimed attacks, explosions, and evacuations were staged by Russia.[68] On 21 February, the head of the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) said that Russian forces had killed five Ukrainian "saboteurs" that crossed into Russian territory, capturing one Ukrainian serviceman and destroying two armoured vehicles. The claim was denied by Ukraine and drew warnings that Russia was seeking further justification to start an invasion. The Sunday Times described it as "the first move in Putin's war plan."[69][70]
Putin's address to the nation on 21 February (English subtitles available)
On 21 February,[71] Putin announced that the Russian government would recognise the Donetsk and Luhansk people's republics.[72] The same evening, Putin directed that Russian troops be deployed into Donbas, in what Russia referred to as a "peacekeeping mission".[73][74] The 21 February intervention in Donbas was condemned by several members of the UN Security Council; none voiced support.[75] On 22 February, video footage shot in the early morning showed Russian armed forces and tanks moving in the Donbas region.[76] The Federation Council unanimously authorised the use of military force outside Russia.[77]
In response, Zelenskyy ordered the conscription of army reservists;[78] The following day, Ukraine's parliament proclaimed a 30-day nationwide state of emergency and ordered the mobilisation of all reservists.[79][80][81] Russia began to evacuate its embassy in Kyiv.[82] The websites of the Ukrainian parliament and government, along with banking websites, were hit by DDoS attacks,[83] widely attributed to Russian-backed hackers.[84][85]
On the night of 23 February,[86] Zelenskyy gave a speech in Russian in which he appealed to the citizens of Russia to prevent war.[87][88] He also refuted Russia's claims about the presence of neo-Nazis in the Ukrainian government and said that he had no intention of attacking the Donbas region.[89] Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on 23 February that the separatist leaders in Donetsk and Luhansk had sent a letter to Putin stating that Ukrainian shelling had caused civilian deaths and appealing for military support from Russia.[90]
In response, Ukraine requested an urgent UN Security Council meeting.[91][92] Half an hour into the emergency meeting, Putin announced the start of military operations in Ukraine. Sergiy Kyslytsya, the Ukrainian representative, subsequently called on the Russian representative, Vasily Nebenzya, to "do everything possible to stop the war" or relinquish his position as president of the UN Security Council; Nebenzya refused.[93][94]
Putin's invasion announcement
Main article: On conducting a special military operation
Putin's address to the nation on 24 February 2022. Minutes after Putin's announcement, the invasion began.
Before 5 a.m. Kyiv time on 24 February, Putin, in another speech, announced a "special military operation", which effectively declared war on Ukraine.[95][96] Putin said the operation was to "protect the people" of the Russian-controlled breakaway republics. He baselessly claimed that Russians in the Donbas had "been facing humiliation and genocide perpetrated by the Kyiv regime", that Ukrainian government officials were neo-Nazis under Western control, that Ukraine was developing nuclear weapons, and that a hostile NATO was building up its forces and military infrastructure in Ukraine.[97][98] He said Russia sought the "demilitarisation and denazification" of Ukraine, and denied the legitimacy of the Ukrainian state.[98][99] Putin said he had no plans to occupy Ukraine.[97] The invasion began within minutes of Putin's speech.[95]
Events

For a more comprehensive list, see List of military engagements during the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
Ukrainian regions annexed by Russia since 2014 (Autonomous Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol) and 2022 (others). The 2022 annexation created a strategic land bridge between Crimea and Russia.
The invasion began at dawn on 24 February.[95][100] Fighting began in Luhansk Oblast at 3:40 a.m. Kyiv time near Milove on the border with Russia.[101] The main infantry and tank attacks were launched in four spearheads, creating a northern front launched towards Kyiv from Belarus, a southern front from Crimea, a southeastern front from Russian-controlled Donbas, and an eastern front from Russia towards Kharkiv and Sumy.[102] Russian vehicles were subsequently marked with a white Z military symbol (a non-Cyrillic letter), believed to be a measure to prevent friendly fire.[103]
Immediately after the invasion began, Zelenskyy declared martial law in Ukraine in a first video speech.[104] The same evening, he ordered a general mobilisation of all Ukrainian males between 18 and 60 years old,[105] prohibiting them from leaving the country.[106] Wagner Group mercenaries and Kadyrovites contracted by the Kremlin reportedly made several attempts to assassinate Zelenskyy, including an operation involving several hundred mercenaries meant to infiltrate Kyiv with the aim of killing the Ukrainian president.[107] The Ukrainian government said anti-war officials within Russia's FSB shared the plans with them.[108]
Zelenskyy appeared defiant in video messages on 24 through 26 February, that he and his cabinet is still in Kyiv. On 26 February NATO met and its countries pledged military aid for Ukraine and on 27 February Germany called the invasion a historic watershed.[109] That day in the evening Putin put Russia's nuclear deterrence into alert.[110]
Remnants of a destroyed Russian column on 27 February in Bucha
The Russian invasion was unexpectedly met by fierce Ukrainian resistance.[111] In Kyiv, Russia failed to take the city and was repulsed in the battles of Irpin, Hostomel, and Bucha. The Russians tried to encircle the capital, but its defenders under Oleksandr Syrskyi held their ground, effectively using Western Javelin anti-tank missiles and Stinger anti-aircraft missiles to thin Russian supply lines and stall the offensive.[112]
On the southern front, Russian forces had captured the regional capital of Kherson by 2 March. A column of Russian tanks and armoured vehicles was ambushed on 9 March outside of Brovary and sustained heavy losses that forced them to retreat.[113] The Russian army adopted siege tactics on the western front around the key cities of Chernihiv, Sumy and Kharkiv, but failed to capture them due to stiff resistance and logistical setbacks.[114] In Mykolaiv Oblast, Russian forces advanced as far as Voznesensk, but were repelled and pushed back south of Mykolaiv. On 25 March, the Russian Defence Ministry stated that the first stage of the "military operation" in Ukraine was "generally complete", that the Ukrainian military forces had suffered serious losses, and the Russian military would now concentrate on the "liberation of Donbas."[115] The "first stage" of the invasion was conducted on four fronts, including one towards western Kyiv from Belarus by the Russian Eastern Military District, comprising the 29th, 35th, and 36th Combined Arms Armies. A second axis, deployed towards eastern Kyiv from Russia by the Central Military District (northeastern front), comprised the 41st Combined Arms Army and the 2nd Guards Combined Arms Army.[116]
Russian troops in Novoaidar. The settlement was captured on 3 March 2022.
A third axis was deployed towards Kharkiv by the Western Military District (eastern front), with the 1st Guards Tank Army and 20th Combined Arms Army. A fourth, southern front originating in occupied Crimea and Russia's Rostov oblast with an eastern axis towards Odesa and a western area of operations toward Mariupol was opened by the Southern Military District, including the 58th, 49th, and 8th Combined Arms Army, the latter also commanding the 1st and 2nd Army Corps of the Russian separatist forces in Donbas.[116] By 7 April, Russian troops deployed to the northern front by the Russian Eastern Military District pulled back from the Kyiv offensive, reportedly to resupply and redeploy to the Donbas region in an effort to reinforce the renewed invasion of southeastern Ukraine. The northeastern front, including the Central Military District, was similarly withdrawn for resupply and redeployment to southeastern Ukraine.[116][117]

The Antonov An-225 Mriya, the largest aircraft ever built, was destroyed during the Battle of Antonov Airport.
Russian efforts to capture Kyiv included a probative spearhead on 24 February, from Belarus south along the west bank of the Dnipro River. The apparent intent was to encircle the city from the west, supported by two separate axes of attack from Russia along the east bank of the Dnipro: the western at Chernihiv, and from the east at Sumy. These were likely intended to encircle Kyiv from the northeast and east.[118][119]
Russia tried to seize Kyiv quickly, with Spetsnaz infiltrating into the city supported by airborne operations and a rapid mechanised advance from the north, but failed.[120][121] The United States contacted Zelenskyy and offered to help him flee the country, lest the Russian Army attempt to kidnap or kill him on seizing Kyiv; Zelenskyy responded that "The fight is here; I need ammunition, not a ride."[122] The Washington Post, which described the quote as "one of the most-cited lines of the Russian invasion", was not entirely sure of the comment's accuracy. Reporter Glenn Kessler said it came from "a single source, but on the surface it appears to be a good one."[123] Russian forces advancing on Kyiv from Belarus gained control of the ghost town of Chernobyl.[124] Russian Airborne Forces attempted to seize two key airfields near Kyiv, launching an airborne assault on Antonov Airport,[125] and a similar landing at Vasylkiv, near Vasylkiv Air Base, on 26 February.[126]
By early March, further Russian advances along the west side of the Dnipro were limited, after suffering setbacks from Ukrainian defence.[119][118] As of 5 March, a large Russian convoy, reportedly 64 kilometres (40 mi) in length, had made little progress toward Kyiv.[127] The London-based think tank Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) assessed the Russian performance from the north and east as "stalled".[128] Advances along the Chernihiv axis had largely halted as a siege of the city began. Russian forces also continued advancing from the northwest of Kyiv, capturing Bucha, Hostomel, and Vorzel by 5 March,[129][130] though Irpin remained contested as of 9 March.[131] By 11 March, it was reported that the lengthy convoy had largely dispersed, taking up positions that offered tree cover. Rocket launchers were also identified.[132] On 16 March, Ukrainian forces began a counter-offensive to repel Russian forces approaching Kyiv from several surrounding cities.[133]
By 20 March, the Russian military appeared to be waging a rapid invasion to achieve its apparent primary goal of the seizure of Kyiv, along with the occupation of Eastern Ukraine and the overthrow of the Ukrainian government. Russian forces quickly became stalled while approaching Kyiv due to several factors, including the disparity in morale and performance between Ukrainian and Russian forces, the Ukrainian use of sophisticated man-portable weapons provided by Western allies, poor Russian logistics and equipment performance, the failure of the Russian Air Force to achieve air superiority, and Russian military attrition during their siege of major cities.[120][134][135] Unable to achieve a quick victory in Kyiv, Russian forces switched strategies and began using standoff weapons, indiscriminate bombing, and siege warfare.[120][136][137]
On 25 March, the Ukrainian counteroffensive in Kyiv resulted in several towns, including Makariv,[138] being retaken to the east and west of Kyiv.[139] As part of a general retreat of Russian forces north of Kyiv, as well as attacks on Russian formations by the Ukrainian military, Russian troops in the Bucha area retreated north by the end of March. Ukrainian forces entered the city on 1 April.[140] Ukraine claimed to recapture the entire region around Kyiv, including Irpin, Bucha, and Hostomel, by 2 April, with evidence of war crimes being uncovered in Bucha.[141] On 6 April, NATO secretary general Jens Stoltenberg said that the Russian "retraction, resupply, and redeployment" of their troops from the Kyiv area should be interpreted as an expansion of Putin's plans for his military actions against Ukraine, by redeploying and concentrating his forces on Eastern Ukraine and Mariupol within the next two weeks, as a precursor to the further expansion of Putin's actions against the rest of Ukraine.[142]

Russian forces advanced into Chernihiv Oblast on 24 February, besieging its administrative capital within four days of fighting. On 25 February Ukrainian forces lost control over Konotop.[143][144] As street fighting took place in the city of Sumy, just 35 kilometres (22 mi) from the Russo-Ukrainian border, Ukrainian forces claimed that on 28 February that 100 Russian armoured vehicles had been destroyed and dozens of soldiers captured following a Bayraktar TB2 drone and artillery attack on a large Russian column near Lebedyn in Sumy Oblast.[145] Russian forces also attacked Okhtyrka, deploying thermobaric weapons.[146]
On 4 March, Frederick Kagan wrote that the Sumy axis was then "the most successful and dangerous Russian avenue of advance on Kyiv", and commented that the geography favoured mechanised advances as the terrain "is flat and sparsely populated, offering few good defensive positions."[118] Travelling along highways, Russian forces reached Brovary, an eastern suburb of Kyiv, on 4 March.[119][118] The Pentagon confirmed on 6 April that the Russian army had left Chernihiv Oblast, but Sumy Oblast remained contested.[147] On 7 April, the governor of Sumy Oblast said that Russian troops were gone, but had left behind rigged explosives and other hazards.[148]

On 24 February, Russian forces took control of the North Crimean Canal, allowing Crimea to obtain water from the Dnieper, which had been cut off since 2014.[149] On 26 February, the siege of Mariupol began as the attack moved east linking to separatist-held Donbas.[146][150] En route, Russian forces entered Berdiansk and captured it.[151] On 25 February, Russian units from the DPR were fighting near Pavlopil as they moved on Mariupol.[152] By evening, the Russian Navy began an amphibious assault on the coast of the Sea of Azov 70 kilometres (43 mi) west of Mariupol. A US defence official said that Russian forces were deploying thousands of marines from this beachhead.[153]
The Russian 22nd Army Corps approached the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant on 26 February[154] and besieged Enerhodar. A fire began,[155][156] but the Ukrainian military said that essential equipment was undamaged.[157] A third Russian attack group from Crimea moved northwest and captured the bridge over the Dnieper.[158] On 2 March, Russian troops took Kherson; this was the first major city to fall to Russian forces.[159] Russian troops moved on Mykolaiv and attacked it two days later. They were repelled by Ukrainian forces.[160]
After renewed missile attacks on 14 March in Mariupol, the Ukrainian government said more than 2,500 had died.[161] By 18 March, Mariupol was completely encircled and fighting reached the city centre, hampering efforts to evacuate civilians.[162] On 20 March, an art school sheltering around 400 people, was destroyed by Russian bombs.[163] The Russians demanded surrender, and the Ukrainians refused.[102][164] On 27 March, Ukrainian deputy prime minister Olha Stefanishyna said that "(m)ore than 85 percent of the whole town is destroyed."[165]
Putin told Emmanuel Macron in a phone call on 29 March that the bombardment of Mariupol would only end when the Ukrainians surrendered.[166] On 1 April, Russian troops refused safe passage into Mariupol to 50 buses sent by the United Nations to evacuate civilians, as peace talks continued in Istanbul.[167] On 3 April, following the retreat of Russian forces from Kyiv, Russia expanded its attack on southern Ukraine further west, with bombardment and strikes against Odesa, Mykolaiv, and the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant.[168][169]

Russian bombardment on the outskirts of Kharkiv, 1 March 2022
In the east, Russian troops attempted to capture Kharkiv, less than 35 kilometres (22 mi) from the Russian border,[170] and met strong Ukrainian resistance. On 25 February, the Millerovo air base was attacked by Ukrainian military forces with OTR-21 Tochka missiles, which according to Ukrainian officials, destroyed several Russian Air Force planes and started a fire.[171] On 1 March, Denis Pushilin, head of the DPR, announced that DPR forces had almost completely surrounded the city of Volnovakha.[172] On 2 March, Russian forces were repelled from Sievierodonetsk during an attack against the city.[173] On the same day, Ukrainian forces initiated a counter-offensive on Horlivka,[174] controlled by the DPR.[175] Izium was captured by Russian forces on 1 April[176] after a monthlong battle.[177]
On 25 March, the Russian defence ministry said it would seek to occupy major cities in eastern Ukraine.[178] On 31 March, PBS News reported renewed shelling and missile attacks in Kharkiv, as bad or worse than before, as peace talks with Russia were to resume in Istanbul.[179]
Amid the heightened Russian shelling of Kharkiv on 31 March, Russia reported a helicopter strike against an oil supply depot approximately 35 kilometres (22 mi) north of the border in Belgorod, and accused Ukraine of the attack.[180] Ukraine denied responsibility.[181] By 7 April, the renewed massing of Russian invasion troops and tank divisions around the towns of Izium, Sloviansk, and Kramatorsk prompted Ukrainian government officials to advise the remaining residents near the eastern border of Ukraine to evacuate to western Ukraine within 2–3 days, given the absence of arms and munitions previously promised to Ukraine by then.[182]
Western Ukraine
On 14 March, Russian forces conducted multiple cruise missile attacks on a military training facility in Yavoriv, Lviv Oblast, close to the Polish border. Local governor Maksym Kozytskyy reported that at least 35 people had been killed in the attacks.[183][184] On 18 March, Russia expanded the attack to Lviv, with Ukrainian military officials saying initial information suggested that the missiles which hit Lviv were likely air-launched cruise missiles originating from warplanes flying over the Black Sea.[185]
Air conflict
On 24 February, Russian forces attacked the Chuhuiv air base,[186] which housed Bayraktar TB2 drones. The attack caused damage to fuel storage areas and infrastructure.[187] The next day, the Millerovo air base was attacked by Ukrainian military forces using OTR-21 Tochka missiles. According to Ukrainian officials, this destroyed several Russian Air Force planes and set the airbase on fire. In the Zhytomyr Airport attack on 27 February, it was reported that Russia used 9K720 Iskander missile systems, located in Belarus, to attack the civilian Zhytomyr Airport.[188][189] Russia lost at least ten aircraft on 5 March.[190] On 6 March, the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reported that 88 Russian aircraft had been destroyed since the war began.[191] However, an anonymous senior US defence official told Reuters on 7 March that Russia still had the "vast majority" of its fighter jets and helicopters that had been amassed near Ukraine available to fly.[192] After the first month of the invasion, Justin Bronk, a British military observer, counted the Russian aircraft losses at 15 fixed-wing aircraft and 35 helicopters, but noted that the true total was certainly higher.[193]
On 13 March, Russian forces conducted multiple cruise missile attacks on a military training facility in Yavoriv, Lviv Oblast, close to the Polish border. Local governor Maksym Kozytskyy reported that at least 35 people had been killed in the attacks.[194][195] The poor performance of the Russian Air Force has been attributed by The Economist to Russia's inability to suppress Ukraine's medium ranged surface-to-air missile (SAM) batteries, Russia's lack of precision-guided bombs, together with Ukrainian mid-range SAM sites that force planes to fly low, making them vulnerable to Stinger and other shoulder-launched surface-to-air missiles, and lack of training and flight hours for Russian pilots rendering them inexperienced for the type of close ground support missions typical of modern air forces.[196]

Naval conflict
Ukraine lies on the Black Sea, which only has access through the Turkish-held Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits. On 28 February, Turkey invoked the 1936 Montreux Convention and sealed off the straits to Russian warships not registered as having Black Sea home bases and not returning to their ports of origin. This prevented the passage of four Russian naval vessels through the Turkish Straits.[197][198][199]
On 24 February, the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine announced that an attack on Snake Island by Russian Navy ships had begun.[200] The cruiser Moskva and patrol boat Vasily Bykov bombarded the island with their deck guns.[201] When the Russian warship identified itself and instructed the Ukrainian soldiers stationed on the island to surrender, their response was "Russian warship, go fuck yourself!"[202][203] After the bombardment, a detachment of Russian soldiers landed and took control of Snake Island.[204]
Russia stated on 26 February that US drones were supplying intelligence to the Ukrainian navy to help target Russian warships in the Black Sea, which the US denied.[205]
By 3 March, the Ukrainian frigate Hetman Sahaidachny, the flagship of the Ukrainian navy, was scuttled in Mykolaiv to prevent its capture by Russian forces.[206][207][208][209] On 14 March, the Russian source RT reported that the Russian Armed Forces had captured about a dozen Ukrainian ships in Berdiansk, including the Polnocny-class landing ship Yuri Olefirenko.[210]
On 24 March, Ukrainian officials said that a Russian landing ship docked in Berdiansk – initially reported to be the Orsk and then its sister ship, the Saratov – was destroyed by a Ukrainian rocket attack.[211][139][151]
Popular resistance
Ukrainian civilians resisted the Russian invasion, volunteering for territorial defence units, making Molotov cocktails, donating food, constructing barriers such as Czech hedgehogs,[212] and helping to transport refugees.[213] Responding to a call from Ukraine's transportation agency, Ukravtodor, civilians dismantled or altered road signs, constructed makeshift barriers, and blocked roadways. Social media reports showed spontaneous street protests against Russian forces in occupied settlements, often evolving into verbal altercations and physical standoffs with Russian troops.[214]
In some instances, people physically blocked Russian military vehicles, sometimes forcing them to retreat.[214][215][216] The Russian soldiers' response to unarmed civilian resistance varied from reluctance to engage the protesters[214] to firing into the air or directly into crowds.[217] There have been mass detentions of Ukrainian protesters, and Ukrainian media reported forced disappearances, mock executions, hostage-taking, extrajudicial killing, and sexual violence perpetrated by the Russian military.[218]
Aftermath
Main article: Russo-Ukrainian war (2022–present)
Further information: Russian annexation of Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia oblasts
Russia abandoned the attempt to take Kyiv in early April, but a lasting state of war between Russia and Ukraine remained, with Russia successfully capturing Mariupol by 20 May 2022,[219] and maintaining an occupation of large portions of four Ukrainian oblasts—Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk, and Zaporizhzhia. In August, Ukrainian forces began liberating territories in the north-east and south.
On 30 September 2022, Russia declared the annexation of the four partially-occupied oblasts, which was internationally condemned. Most of Luhansk Oblast and part of Donetsk Oblast had been controlled by pro-Russian separatists since 2014, while the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts were invaded by Russia in 2022. The boundaries of the areas to be annexed and their borders were not defined; Russian officials stated that they would be defined later. None of the oblasts were fully under Russian control at the time of the declaration, nor since. If limited to the areas then under Russian control (about 90,000 km2 or 15% of Ukraine's territory, roughly the size of Portugal) the annexation would still be the largest in Europe since World War II.[220]
From then through 2023, Russian offensives and Ukrainian counteroffensives gained only small amounts of territory. The war has also led to attacks in Russia by Ukrainian and Ukrainian-backed forces, among them a cross-border offensive into Russia's Kursk region in August 2024. Russia has repeatedly carried out deliberate and indiscriminate attacks on civilians far from the frontline.[221][222][223] The International Criminal Court (ICC) opened an investigation into war crimes and issued arrest warrants for Putin and several other Russian officials.

UN General Assembly Resolution ES-11/1 vote on 2 March 2022 condemning the invasion of Ukraine and demanding a complete withdrawal of Russian troops  In favour  Against  Abstained  Absent  Non-member
The invasion received widespread international condemnation from governments and intergovernmental organisations.[224] On 2 March 2022 and on 23 February 2023, 141 member states of the UN General Assembly voted for a resolution saying that Russia should immediately withdraw. Seven, including Russia, voted against the measure.[225] Political reactions to the invasion included new sanctions imposed on Russia, which triggered widespread economic effects on the Russian and world economies.[226] Sanctions forced Russia to reorient its oil exports to non-sanctioning countries such as India, rely more on LNG (which was not subject to European Union sanctions), and shift its coal exports from Europe to Asia.[227] Most European countries cancelled nuclear cooperation with Russia.[228]
Over seventy sovereign states and the European Union delivered humanitarian aid to Ukraine, and nearly fifty countries plus the EU provided military aid.[229] Economic sanctions included a ban on Russian aircraft using EU airspace,[230] a ban of certain Russian banks from the SWIFT international payments system, and a ban on certain Russian media outlets.[231] Reactions to the invasion have included public response, media responses, peace efforts, and the examination of the legal implications of the invasion.
Some countries, particularly in the Global South, saw public sympathy or outright support for Russia, due in part to distrust of US foreign policy.[232] Protests and demonstrations were held worldwide, including some in Russia and parts of Ukraine occupied by Russia.[233] Calls for a boycott of Russian goods spread on social media platforms,[234] while hackers attacked Russian websites, particularly those operated by the Russian government.[235] Anti-Russian sentiment against Russians living abroad surged after the invasion.[236] In March 2022, Russian President Putin introduced prison sentences of up to 15 years for publishing "fake news" about Russian military operations,[237] intended to suppress any criticism related to the war.[238]
