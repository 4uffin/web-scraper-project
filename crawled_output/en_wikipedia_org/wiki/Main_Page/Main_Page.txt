In the Spaghetti House siege, an attempted robbery of the Spaghetti House restaurant in September 1975 in Knightsbridge, London, three men barricaded themselves and the staff in a storeroom. The ringleader was Franklin Davies, a 28-year-old Nigerian student who had previously served time in prison for armed robbery. The hostages were released unharmed after six days. Two of the gunmen gave themselves up, and Davies shot himself in the stomach. All three were later imprisoned, as was one of their accomplices. The police used fibre optic camera technology for live surveillance, and monitored the actions and conversations of the gunmen. The feed was watched by a forensic psychologist who advised police on the state of the men's minds, and how to best manage the ongoing negotiations. The siege was concluded on 3 October 1975. The 1976 play A Hole in Babylon and the 1982 Italian comedy film Spaghetti House were loosely based on the events of the siege. (Full article...)

Marshal Foch
The position of Marshal Foch Professor of French Literature at the University of Oxford was founded in 1918 shortly after the end of the First World War. Ferdinand Foch, or "Marshal Foch" (pictured), was supreme commander of Allied forces from April 1918 onwards. The chair was endowed by an arms trader, Basil Zaharoff, in Foch's honour; he also endowed a post in English Literature at the University of Paris in honour of the British Field Marshal Earl Haig. Zaharoff wanted the University of Paris to have a right of veto over the appointment, but Oxford would not accept this. The compromise reached was that Paris should have a representative on the appointing committee (although this provision was later removed). In advance of the first election, Stéphen Pichon (the French Foreign Minister) unsuccessfully attempted to influence the decision.
The first professor, Gustave Rudler, was appointed in 1920. (Full list...)

Today's featured picture
The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 is a United States federal law that was passed by the 89th Congress and signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson on October 3, 1965. The act formally removed de facto discrimination against people of various ethnicities from the country's immigration policy and created a system giving priority to various categories of people such as relatives of US citizens, skilled professionals, and refugees. Previous policy consisted of the National Origins Formula of the 1920s, whose aim was to preserve American homogeneity by promoting immigration from Western and Northern Europe, an approach which came under attack during the civil rights movement for being racially discriminatory. This photograph shows President Johnson officially signing the Immigration and Nationality Act in a ceremony on Liberty Island in New York City.
