From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
A side-by-side of insect species from fifteen different orders, from top to bottom: Zygentoma, Odonata, EphemeropteraDermaptera, Phasmatodea, OrthopteraMantodea, Blattodea, HemipteraPsocodea, Hymenoptera, ColeopteraLepidoptera, Diptera, Neuroptera
Insecta is a class of invertebrates that consists of around 30 individual orders.[1] Orders are the fifth taxonomic rank used to classify living organisms, below the rank of class, but above the rank of family.[2] With around 1 million insect species having been formally described and assigned a binomial name, insects are the most diverse group of animals, comprising approximately half of extant species on Earth. The total insect biodiversity has been estimated at around 6 million species.[3][4] The most diverse orders are Coleoptera (beetles), Hymenoptera (wasps, bees, ants and sawflies), Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths), Diptera (flies) and Hemiptera (true bugs).[5] Taxonomists disagree on the exact number of orders, with opinions ranging from 26 to 32 distinct extant orders.[6]
Insecta was originally divided into seven orders in 1758 by Carl Linnaeus in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae. When Insecta was originally described it was split into two informal groups, Paleoptera and Neoptera.[7] Insects that do not have the ability to fold their wings over their abdomen were sorted into Paleoptera, and ones that could (or had an ancestor that could) were sorted into Neoptera.[7] Individual orders were primarily defined by the number and structure of wings, with other factors such as antennae being considered.[8] The classification of insects changes as new discoveries are found, with species regularly shifted around different orders.[9] The most recent order described was the monotypic (an order with only one family) Mantophasmatodea in 2002.[9]
Apterygota[edit]
Apterygota is a paraphyletic (a grouping that consists of the grouping's last common ancestor and some but not all of its descendant lineages) group containing two orders of primitive and wingless insects, historically united on the basis of morphology.[10]

ArchaeognathaBörner, 1904
Jumping bristletails
The Archaeognatha are the most evolutionarily primitive taxa (remaining mostly unchanged since their most recent common ancestor) in insects.[12] Species are characterized by their elongated bodies and retractable mouthparts. They have an arched thorax and a small head.[12] Bodies are cylindrical and do not have any scales.[13] They are distributed globally and prefer woodland areas.[13] Their tails consist of three long structures and can use them to jump up to 12 inches.[14]
500[11]
Trigoniophthalmus alternatus
ZygentomaBörner, 1904
Silverfish and firebrats
Species of Zygentoma are usually flat with two lengthy cerci (primitive sensory organs that can detect light).[15] The most widely distributed species is the silverfish (Lepisma saccharinum).[16] The thoraxes are wide, and the surface is covered in small dry scales.[17] Most live under bark or litter structures.[17] They are most common in humid environments, but some species have developed to withstand higher temperatures.[17]
600[11]
Ctenolepisma lineatum
Palaeoptera[edit]
Palaeoptera is an infraclass (the taxonomic rank directly below subclass) of insects with 2 existing orders.[18] Wings of Palaeoptera cannot be folded back when they are not being used, and species undergo hemimetaboly (metamorphosis missing one or more stages rather than complete metamorphosis).[19]

Notes[edit]
^ The author citation (last name and year of the person(s) who originally described the order) is listed under the order name.
^ The exact number of species changes as new ones are described; the figures described are based on a 2013 report by Zhi-Qiang Zhang, and orders with more than 100 species are rounded to the nearest hundred.[11]
