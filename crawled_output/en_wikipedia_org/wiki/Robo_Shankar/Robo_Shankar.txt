Robo Shankar (24 December 1978 – 18 September 2025) was an Indian stand-up comedian and actor who appeared predominantly in Tamil films and television. Making his breakthrough with Star Vijay's Kalakka Povathu Yaaru? by performing stand-up comedy, he was cast regularly in several shows on Star Vijay and has presented television shows for the channel. He was also the voice-over for Pumbaa in the official Tamil dub of The Lion King (2019) and Mufasa (2024).
Career[edit]
Shankar was born in Madurai on 24 December 1978.[1] He earned the name Robo Shankar after performing robot dances in village shows.[2] He was a mimicry artist and initially performed on Kalakka Povathu Yaaru? and the 'Siricha Pochu' segment of Athu Ithu Ethu.[3] He was offered by Gokul a role in Rowthiram (2011); however, many of his scenes were edited out from the film barring a song appearance.[4] Gokul again cast him in a role,
Idharkuthane Aasaipattai Balakumara (2013), which gave him a break as an actor.[4] After doing small roles in Yaaruda Mahesh and Kappal, Balaji Mohan cast Shankar in Vaayai Moodi Pesavum (2014).[5] He portrayed a negative character in Touring Talkies (2015).[6] He then acted in Maari (2015), where his performance was mentioned by critics that he "deserves a special mention" and "steals the show with his unique one-liners and body language".[7][8] His performance as an MLA who undergoes a coma in Velainu Vandhutta Vellaikaaran (2016) was well received with critics describing his performance as "a scream" and
"the most show-stopping, laugh-till-you-cry — and yes, BP-reducing — comedy stretch of the year".[9][10]
Personal life[edit]
Shankar's daughter Indraja Shankar made her acting debut in Bigil, as one of the women football players and also a castaway in Zee Tamil's Survivor show.[11] His wife Priyanka Shankar made her acting debut with Kanni Maadam (2020), for which he worked as a playback singer.[12][13] In 2023, several netizens expressed concern after he lost extra weight due to jaundice while on his weight loss journey.[14]
Death[edit]
On 18 September 2025, Shankar collapsed on the set of the film GodsJilla in Chennai and was admitted to GEM hospital, Perungudi.[15][2] He was placed in intensive care after fluctuations in blood pressure and died later that day, at the age of 46. He had already been suffering with ethanol-induced liver cirrhosis. He also undergone treatment for jaundice, which resulted in significant muscle loss.[16][17][18] His body was taken to his residence in Valasaravakkam, Chennai, and the funeral was scheduled to be held there on 19 September.[16]
