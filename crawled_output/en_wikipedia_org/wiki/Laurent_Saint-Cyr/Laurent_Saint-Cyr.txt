Laurent Saint-Cyr is a Haitian businessman and politician currently serving as the 4th chairman of the Transitional Presidential Council of Haiti since 7 August 2025. He is a member of the Council representing the private sector and has previously worked in the insurance industry.
Biography[edit]
Saint-Cyr is a wealthy businessman and has served in the insurance industry in Haiti for many years.[1][2] He served as the director for personal insurance at the Alternative Insurance Company from 2009 to 2021, then became the company's executive director for business development while also chairing the Internal Audit Committee.[3] He also served as the president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Haiti and as president of the Haitian Chamber of Commerce and Industry.[2]
Saint-Cyr served on the High Council of Transition, which aimed to promote national dialogue and the organization of elections, from 2023 to 2024.[1] In April 2024, he was named a member of the Transitional Presidential Council, the body temporarily acting as head of state, representing the private sector.[4][5] In September, he became the inaugural peace fellow at the Yale Jackson School of Global Affairs.[4] On 7 August 2025, Saint-Cyr succeeded Fritz Jean as chairman of the Transitional Council, marking the first time that both the head of council and the head of government of Haiti were led by members of the private sector.[2] He was inaugurated at the Villa d'Acceui in Port-au-Prince amidst threats from gang leader Jimmy Chérizier to overthrow the government.[5] A United Nations-supported force reported the thwarting of several plots to "disrupt national stability and render the country ungovernable" on the day of his inauguration, while "bursts of gunfire" were heard during his transition to office.[5] His term will expire on 7 February 2026.[5]
