The Wall Street Historic District in New York City includes part of Wall Street and parts of nearby streets in the Financial District in Lower Manhattan. The district includes 65 contributing buildings and one contributing structure over a 63-acre (25 ha) listed area.[1]
The street plan of the historic district dates back to the colonial era. The layout "reflects medieval European town patterns rather than the standard grid found throughout much of Manhattan, and together with the district's towering skyscrapers it creates the narrow 'canyons' for which the area is so famous."[2]
Sites within the district[edit]
Within the historic district are 21 sites that are individually (i.e., separately) listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), as follows:[3]
