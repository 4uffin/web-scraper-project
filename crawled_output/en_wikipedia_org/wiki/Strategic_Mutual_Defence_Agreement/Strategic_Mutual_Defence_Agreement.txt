2025 Pakistan–Saudi Arabia treaty
Strategic Mutual Defence AgreementPakistan and Saudi Arabia, parties to the AgreementTypeDefence pactSigned17 September 2025; 7 days ago (2025-09-17)LocationAl Yamamah Palace, Riyadh, Saudi ArabiaSignatoriesPrime Minister of Pakistan (Shehbaz Sharif)Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia (Mohammed Bin Salman)Parties Pakistan Saudi ArabiaLanguageEnglish
The Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement (SMDA; Urdu: تزویراتی باہمی دفاعی معاہدہ;[1] Arabic: اتفاقية الدفاع المشترك الاستراتيجي) is a security and defence pact between the countries of Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. Under this agreement, both countries have committed to treating any act of aggression against one as an act against both (also known as collective security). It was signed on 17 September 2025 at Al Yamamah Palace in Riyadh by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who was in Saudi Arabia on a state visit.[2][3][4]
Background[edit]
See also: Pakistan–Saudi Arabia relations
Both Pakistan and Saudi Arabia share a long-standing relationship encompassing military and economic cooperation, as well as cultural and religious ties.[5]
In recent years, shifts in Middle Eastern geopolitics—including concerns about external threats, responses to Israeli military actions, and doubts regarding American reliability as a security guarantor—have intensified regional security concerns. Many analysts view the agreement, at least in part, as a response to these dynamics.[6][7][5][8]
Israeli airstrikes on Qatar[edit]
The Financial Times reported that the 9 September 2025 Israeli airstrike in Doha, Qatar, deeply unsettled the Gulf states' sense of security, exacerbating long-standing concerns about U.S. unpredictability and commitment to their defence.[9] The attacks particularly challenged U.S. obligations under the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), which include protecting capital cities in exchange for oil and gas, a framework in which Saudi Arabia is a participant.[10][5] A senior Saudi official stated, "We hope it [the agreement] will reinforce our deterrence—aggression against one is aggression against the other".[9] Furthermore, the strikes threatened U.S. commitments to the Pakistan–U.S. Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement of 1954—the same year Pakistan joined the Southeast Asia Collective Defence Treaty (SEATO) and the Middle East Treaty Organization (later CENTO).[11]
Agreement[edit]
The treaty was signed on 17 September 2025 by the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, and the Pakistani prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, in Riyadh. It came against the backdrop of the Israeli strikes on Qatar and followed the Arab–Islamic extraordinary summit in Doha.[12] Both countries have had close economic, religious, and security ties since the 1960s,[3][13] when Pakistani troops were first deployed on Saudi frontiers over fears of Egypt's participation in the North Yemen civil war.[11][13][14] Since then, Pakistan has trained between 8,000 and 10,000 Saudi military personnel.[11][15][16]
According to a statement by the Saudi Arabia Press Department, "The agreement states that any aggression against either country shall be considered an aggression against both."[17] The agreement's text was not officially published.[11]
Nuclear sharing[edit]
See also: Nuclear sharing § Potential nuclear sharing between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia
Pakistan's nuclear weapons program began in the early 1970s. Its first tests, code-named Chagai-I, were performed in 1998 and led to the country being generally viewed as having nuclear capabilities by 1998.[18][19] Saudi Arabia reportedly provided funding for these operations.[13] A senior Saudi official told Reuters, regarding whether Pakistan would provide Saudi Arabia with a nuclear umbrella: "This is a comprehensive defensive agreement that encompasses all military means."[7] However, nuclear weaponry is not explicitly mentioned.[11] It is the first military pact between a GCC state and a nuclear power.[17]
Reactions[edit]
Geopolitical analyst Ian Bremmer suggested that the pact could alter India's security calculus, particularly if Saudi Arabia is committed to coming to Pakistan's defence in the event of a conflict.[20]
Domestic[edit]
Pakistan[edit]
An editorial in the Pakistani newspaper Dawn called it "the most significant upgrade to Pakistan–Saudi defence relations in decades".[21] Former Pakistani diplomat Hussein Haqqani noted that the treaty likely covers missile defence.[22]
Saudi Arabia[edit]
Saudi officials portrayed the pact as a formalization of a long-standing military partnership, while also using it to send a message of strategic diversification amid regional turmoil.[11]
Regional[edit]
Some neighbouring states and regional powers have expressed concern about the impact on the regional security balance. India, in particular, has reacted with statements that it is carefully monitoring the development.[23][24] Analysts speaking to The Hindu said the timing of the pact appeared to be a warning after Israel's expanding military offensive across the Middle East.[25]
The Institute for the Study of War reported that the Iranian government was likely concerned about the pact, regarding previous Iranian hostilities and strikes on the territories of both Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, including the 2019 Abqaiq–Khurais attack and the 2024 Iranian missile strikes in Pakistan.[26]
