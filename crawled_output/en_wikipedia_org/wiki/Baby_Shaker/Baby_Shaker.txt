2009 video game

Baby Shaker is a controversial discontinued mobile game that was available on the Apple App Store for a short time in April 2009. Developed by Sikalosoft, the game features a minigame in which players can quiet an illustration of a baby accompanied by crying noises by either rocking their iPhone or shaking it, the latter of which results in the depicted baby's death. The app received widespread negative attention across the Internet from accusations of promoting shaken baby syndrome.
Description[edit]
Baby Shaker was developed in 2009 by Sikalosoft, which, according to The Guardian, is operated by a single programmer named Alex Talbot.[1] The game was approved for the App Store later that year by a team led by Phillip Shoemaker, an Apple employee who was in charge of iOS app approvals.[2]
The game was sold for US$0.99 (equivalent to $1.45 in 2024).[3]
Baby Shaker solely consists of a minigame in which a timer counts from 0 and the sounds of a baby crying are heard over a black-and-white illustration of a baby. There are two ways players can calm the baby down: they can either rock their iPhone back and forth as if they are cradling a baby in their arms,[2] or they can shake their iPhone, which results in two red Xs appearing over the baby's eyes, symbolizing the baby's death. After the baby stops crying, the user is asked if they would like to play again. The goal of the game is to endure the baby's cries for as long as possible.[4]
Baby Shaker received negative feedback from both parents and child protection groups, accusing the game of promoting shaken baby syndrome[5] and infanticide;[6] the game's description warned to "Never, never shake a baby".[7] According to Shoemaker, protesters showed up outside of Apple Infinite Loop campus, and he admitted that the app's approval was a mistake on his end.[2] In response to the criticism, Baby Shaker was removed from the App Store on April 23, 2009, two days after its release.[3][8] Apple then issued an apology for approving the app, calling it "deeply offensive".[9] RTVE criticized Apple for not explaining why the app was approved.[10]
