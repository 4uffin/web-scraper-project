She was president of the charity Humanists UK from January 2019 to May 2022, and is now a vice-president of the organisation.
Early life and education[edit]
Roberts was born in Bristol in 1973,[3] the daughter of an aeronautical engineer and an English and arts teacher.[4] She grew up in the Bristol suburb of Westbury-on-Trym, where she attended the private Red Maids' School.[3][5][6] In December 1988, she won the BBC1 Blue Peter Young Artists competition, appearing with her picture and the presenters on the front cover of the 10 December 1988 edition of the Radio Times.[7]
Roberts studied medicine at the University of Wales College of Medicine (now part of Cardiff University) and graduated in 1997 with a Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (MB BCh) degree, having gained an intercalated Bachelor of Science degree in anatomy.[5][8][9] In 2008, after seven years, she completed her PhD in paleopathology, the study of disease in ancient human remains.[10]
Research and career[edit]

After graduating, Roberts worked as a junior doctor with the National Health Service in South Wales for 18 months. In 1998, she left clinical medicine and worked as an anatomy demonstrator at the University of Bristol, becoming a lecturer there in 1999.[3][5]
She spent seven years working part-time on her PhD in paleopathology, receiving the degree in 2008.[3][5][11] She was a senior teaching fellow at the University of Bristol Centre for Comparative and Clinical Anatomy, where her main roles were teaching clinical anatomy, embryology, and physical anthropology, as well as researching osteoarchaeology and paleopathology.[5][8][12] She stated in 2009 that she was working towards becoming a professor of anatomy.[13]
In 2009, she co-presented modules for the Beating Bipolar programme, the first online treatment package for bipolar depression, trialled by Cardiff University researchers. A clinical trial began in June 2009 involving about 100 patients with bipolar disorder in South Wales.[14]
From August 2009 until January 2012, Roberts was a visiting fellow in both the Department of Archaeology and Anthropology and the Department of Anatomy of the University of Bristol.[8][15][16]
From 2009 to 2016 Roberts was Director of Anatomy at the NHS Severn Deanery School of Surgery[9] and also an honorary fellow at Hull York Medical School.[17][18]
In February 2012, Roberts was appointed the University of Birmingham's first Professor of Public Engagement in Science.[19][20][21]
Roberts has been a member of the advisory board of Cheltenham Science Festival for 10 years and a member of the Advisory Board of the Milner Centre for Evolution at the University of Bath since 2018.[22]
Writing in the i newspaper in 2016, Roberts dismissed the aquatic ape hypothesis (AAH) as a distraction "from the emerging story of human evolution that is more interesting and complex", adding that AAH has become "a theory of everything" that is simultaneously "too extravagant and too simple". She concluded by saying that "science is about evidence, not wishful thinking".[23][24]
Roberts and Aoife McLysaght co-presented the 2018 Royal Institution Christmas Lectures in London.[22][25] She was president of the British Science Association for the year 2019–2020.[26]

In March 2011, she presented a BBC documentary in the Horizon series entitled Are We Still Evolving?[39] Later in 2011, she presented another BBC documentary called How to Build a Dinosaur,[40] which aired on BBC4 on 21 September 2011.
