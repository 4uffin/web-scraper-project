Musical artist
Signature
Tyla Laura Seethal (born 30 January 2002), mononymously known as Tyla, is a South African singer and songwriter. Her musical style is characterised by a fusion of pop and amapiano, with many publications dubbing her "Queen of Popiano". She gained international recognition after the release of her 2023 single "Water", which entered the top ten in multiple countries including her native South Africa, the United Kingdom and the United States.
Born in Edenvale and raised in Johannesburg, Tyla signed with Epic Records in 2021 following the domestic success of her 2019 debut single, "Getting Late". Her song "Water" was the first song by a South African soloist to enter the US Billboard Hot 100 in 55 years and was awarded the inaugural Grammy Award for Best African Music Performance. The single preceded her self-titled debut album (2024), which was released to critical acclaim and moderate commercial success, entering or approaching the top 25 in multiple countries including the United States.
Tyla is the youngest African artist in history to win a Grammy Award. Her other accolades include two MTV Video Music Awards, two BET Awards, three MTV Europe Music Awards and the honorary Global Force Award at the first Billboard R&B's No. 1's, among nominations for a Brit Award, an Ivor Novello Award, a Soul Train Music Award and nine South African Music Awards.
Early life[edit]
Tyla Laura Seethal[4] was born on 30 January 2002 in Edenvale, Gauteng,[5][6] to a Coloured family with Indian,[7][8] Indo-Mauritian, Zulu and Irish ancestry.[9][10][11] She grew up in Johannesburg, Gauteng,[12] and graduated from Edenglen High School in 2019, where she was the Head of Culture.[13]
During her final year of high school, she began pursuing a career in music, posting original songs and covers on Instagram and actively seeking out opportunities in the music industry. She was discovered by her first manager, Garth von Glehn, who organized her first recording sessions.[3][14] Tyla stated that she spent every weekend of her final year of high school in the recording studio.[15]
Career[edit]
2019–2022: "Getting Late" and national success[edit]
In late 2019 after finishing high school,[7] Tyla self-released her debut single, "Getting Late" featuring production from Kooldrink, which achieved national success.[10] Filmed by her own manager intermittently throughout the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns,[14] the accompanying music video was released in January 2021.[16] It amassed several million views on YouTube,[17] and was nominated for South African Music Award for Best Music Video of the Year in 2022.[18]
As of 2021, she started studying towards a degree in mining engineering,[19] and after much persuasion and "a lot of crying", her parents had agreed to let Tyla take a year off university to attempt to lift her music career off the ground.[15] She then signed a recording contract with Epic Records through a joint venture with Fax Records in the United States in May 2021.[20][21] She followed up her debut single with the singles "Overdue" in October 2021, and "To Last" in November 2022.[22][23]
2023–2024: International breakthrough with "Water"[edit]

Tyla's first public performance occurred in 2023 during the Dolce & Gabbana afterparty at Milan Fashion Week,[24][10] following the release of her single "Been Thinking",[25][26] which earned Tyla her first chart placements of her career, on the Billboard Mainstream R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay and Rhythmic Airplay charts.[27][28] Heven Haile of Pitchfork described it as a "slick club anthem that channels the seductive pop-R&B hits of mid-2000s Ciara and Rihanna".[29] Tyla then joined Chris Brown as the opening act for his Under the Influence Tour.[30] In May 2023, she released the single "Girl Next Door", featuring Nigerian singer Ayra Starr.[31]
She released the song "Water" in July 2023 as the lead single from her self-titled debut studio album.[32][10] After spawning a viral dance challenge on the social media platform TikTok,[33][34] "Water" peaked within the top 10 in multiple countries including South Africa,[35] the United States,[36] and the United Kingdom.[37] Tyla became the first and youngest-ever South African soloist in 55 years to enter the US Billboard Hot 100 with "Water", following Hugh Masekela's "Grazing in the Grass" in 1968.[38]
Tyla performed "Water" live on The Bianca Show in Sweden and The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon in the United States.[39][40] The music video for "Water" was released on 6 October 2023, it accumulated 3 million views on YouTube in three days.[41] Tyla was then featured on a remix version of "Girls Need Love" by Summer Walker, released as part of the latter's Girls Mix extended play in October 2023.[42] On the eve of December 2023, she announced the release of her debut studio album, Tyla (2024), and simultaneously released three songs: "Truth or Dare", "On and On", and "Butterflies", as promotional singles from the project on an extended play of the same name.[43] Tyla performed a medley of "Water" and "Truth or Dare" on the season 24 finale of The Voice on 19 December 2023.[44] At the 66th Annual Grammy Awards in February 2024, Tyla won the inaugural Grammy Award for Best African Music Performance with "Water", also becoming the youngest-ever African artist to win a Grammy Award.[45]
Tyla's self-titled debut album was officially released via Fax and Epic Records on 22 March 2024.[46] The accompanying music video for "Art" was released in tandem with the album.[47] Tyla received widespread critical acclaim,[48] and was a top-25 album in the United States,[49] the United Kingdom,[37] the Netherlands,[50] Norway,[51] New Zealand,[52] and Switzerland.[53] Tyla received the most nominations at the 18th Metro FM Music Awards in South Africa, with six nods.[54][55] She went on to win the most awards at the 2024 BET Awards, tying with Usher and Victoria Monét at the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles, California,[56] where she delivered a live performance of "Jump" for the first time alongside Gunna and Skillibeng.[57]
On 11 October 2024, Tyla released the deluxe edition of her self-tilted debut studio album comprising three additional songs including "Push 2 Start". Musically, "Push 2 Start" is a reggae-infused amapiano pop-R&B track, which was positively received and its music video premiered on YouTube on 8 November 2024.[58][59][60][61] Tyla performed at the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show 2024.[62][63]
On November 11, 2024, she made her debut appearance at the MTV Europe Music Awards (EMAs), performing her singles "Push 2 Start" and "Water".[64] That night, she won 3 EMAs for ‘Best African Act’, ‘Best Afrobeats Artist’ and ‘Best R&B Artist’.[64] On December 5 and 7, 2024, Tyla held two concerts in her native South Africa, in Cape Town and Pretoria, respectively, with an additional date added in Pretoria for January 18, 2025.[65] These shows preceded the start of her Tyla Tour in 2025, which will include rescheduled shows in Europe that were postponed from their original 2024 dates, due to Tyla sustaining an injury.[66]
2025–present: "WWP" EP and upcoming second studio album[edit]
Tyla was featured on the song "When I'm with You" by the Thai rapper Lisa from her album Alter Ego, which was released on February 28.[67] On April 18, 2025, a remix of the WizTheMc and Bees & Honey song "Show Me Love" featuring Tyla was released.[68] The remix was debuted live at her
Coachella 2025 set, where she also performed her upcoming single "Bliss" for the first time.[69] On May 9, 2025, Tyla released the single "Bliss",[70] and hosted the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards the following month.[71] A second single, "Is It", was released on July 11.[72]
She wrote the song "Everything Goes with Blue" for the upcoming film Smurfs soundtrack, which was released on July 18.[73] "Bliss" and "Is It" were included on her extended-play WWP, which was released on July 25.[74] Tyla described the EP as "a bridge to the second album", which is set to be released later in 2025, and is "going to be such a totally different vibe than what people are expecting".[75] WWP will be supported by her second concert tour, the We Wanna Party Tour, which is set to begin in November 2025 in Asia.[76] On September 7, 2025, Tyla attended the 2025 MTV Video Music Awards, where she won the Best Afrobeats award for "Push 2 Start" (2024), marking her second win in the category after she previously won the award for "Water" (2023) at the 2024 ceremony.[77]
Artistry[edit]
"When I was a kid, I always hoped that a pop star like Rihanna, Britney Spears or Michael Jackson would come out of South Africa. I wanted a star to come from my hometown. Now, for the people of my hometown, I want to be a pop star who represents South Africa"
Tyla talking to Rolling Stone on 19 January 2024.[78]
Tyla's biggest musical influences include Michael Jackson, Rihanna,[79] Beyoncé, Britney Spears,[80] Drake, Wizkid,[81] Whitney Houston, Freshlyground,[10] Aaliyah[79] and Cassie.[82] She has said that her dream is to become the first global pop star from Africa.[83][14] She has since been deemed the "Queen of Popiano",[12][84] a fusion of the pop and amapiano genres,[85] infused with elements of R&B and Afrobeats.[86]
