This article is about the year 1934.
For the novel by Alberto Moravia, see 1934 (novel).
From top to bottom, left to right: the Night of the Long Knives sees Hitler purge SA leaders and rivals, solidifying his dictatorship; the Assassination of Alexander I of Yugoslavia shocks Europe as the king and French Foreign Minister Barthou are killed; the 1934 FIFA World Cup in Italy ends with the hosts defeating Czechoslovakia, boosting Mussolini’s propaganda; the Long March begins as Chinese Communists retreat across thousands of kilometers from Nationalist forces; the Austrian Civil War erupts as Social Democrats clash with the Austrofascist government, ending in authoritarian consolidation; and the Revolution of 1934 sparks uprisings across Spain by workers and leftist factions, foreshadowing wider political conflict.
