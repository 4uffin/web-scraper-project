Summary
DescriptionMary Church Terrell - cph.3b47842.jpg
Gelatin silver photographic print of Mary Church Terrell, 25.4 x 20.5 cm.
Restoration note
As far as I can tell from other photos of her, Terrell is a very light-skinned African-American, so I've left levels alone. There was a lot of grain and damage; It's possible I've removed some vague blob that was, in fact, representing something really there, or left something that was just damage, but that's more likely to be in the background than in the relatively well-defined image of Terrell herself. In particular, the lighter blob on the right may be damage from handling, or some sort of out-of-focus curtain, or light bleed-in. It is, at least, outwith the encyclopedically significant part of the image.

Note: Another scan of this exists at the Library of Congress, but that scan has some odd levels that eat much of the image detail in ways that don't appear undoable.
