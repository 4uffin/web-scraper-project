The 77th Primetime Emmy Awards honored the best in American prime time television programming from June 1, 2024, until May 31, 2025, as chosen by the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences.[1] The awards ceremony was held live on September 14, 2025, at the Peacock Theater in Downtown Los Angeles, California, and was preceded by the 77th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards on September 6 and 7. During the ceremony, Emmy Awards were presented in 26 categories. The ceremony aired on CBS and Paramount+,[2][3] with Nate Bargatze serving as host.[4]
At the main ceremony, The Studio won four awards, including Outstanding Comedy Series, and The Pitt won three awards, including Outstanding Drama Series. Adolescence led all shows with six wins, including Outstanding Limited or Anthology Series. Other winning programs included Hacks, Last Week Tonight with John Oliver, and Severance with two wins each, and Andor, The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, The Penguin, Saturday Night Live 50th Anniversary Special, Slow Horses, Somebody Somewhere, and The Traitors with one each. Including Creative Arts Emmys, The Studio led all shows with 13 wins, while HBO, alongside its partner HBO Max, and Netflix led all networks with 30 wins each.
Winners and nominees[edit]
The nominations for the 77th Primetime Emmy Awards were announced on July 15, 2025, at the Television Academy's Wolf Theatre in North Hollywood, Los Angeles hosted by actor Harvey Guillén and actress Brenda Song along with Television Academy chair Cris Abrego.[5] The nominees for Outstanding Reality Competition Program and Outstanding Talk Series were revealed on CBS Mornings a few hours prior.[6] Including nominations at the 77th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards, Severance led all programs with 27 nominations, followed by The Penguin with 24 nominations.[7] The Studio became the most-nominated first-year comedy series in the awards' history with 23 nominations; the Apple TV+ comedy surpassed the record held by the sports comedy Ted Lasso (also on Apple TV+), which received 20 nominations in 2021. The series also tied The Bear's 23 nominations in the previous year for most nominations for a comedy series in a single season.[8]
Sterling K. Brown, nominated for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series for his role in Paradise, tied with Andre Braugher and Don Cheadle for most nominations by a Black male performer with 11 nominations each.[9] At age 77, Kathy Bates became the oldest nominee for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series for her performance in Matlock,[10] and at age 21, Bella Ramsey became the youngest two-time nominee for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series for their performance in The Last of Us.[11] Ramsey is also the first non-binary person to be nominated more than once for an acting Emmy.[12] At age 83, for his role on Shrinking, Harrison Ford became the second oldest nominee for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series behind Alan Arkin, who was nominated in that category in 2020 for his work on The Kominsky Method.[13] Ayo Edebiri, nominated for both Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series and Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series for her work on The Bear, became the first Black woman nominated for both acting and directing in the same year. At age 29, Edebiri is also the youngest Black woman to receive three acting nominations in her career.[14] For the first time in Emmys history, the nominees for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series had at least one woman included in each of the writing teams.[14] HBO and its streaming service HBO Max led all networks and platforms with 142 nominations; Netflix came in second place with 120 nominations.[15]
The winners were announced on September 14, following the Creative Arts Emmys on September 6 and 7. With 30 total wins each, HBO and its streaming service HBO Max tied with Netflix to lead all networks and platforms.[16] Combined with its nine Creative Arts Emmys, The Studio was the most awarded comedy in a single year with thirteen wins, breaking The Bear's record of eleven from the previous year.[17] Seth Rogen won four awards for the aforementioned program to tie Moira Demos, Amy Sherman-Palladino, and Dan Levy for the most wins for an individual in one year.[18] The Pitt became the first medical procedural to win Outstanding Drama Series since ER in 1996.[19] Tramell Tillman became the first Black male performer to win Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series for his work on Severance.[20] At age 15, for his role in Adolescence, Owen Cooper became the youngest male acting winner in Emmy history, breaking a record previously held by Scott Jacoby who won Outstanding Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role in a Drama in 1973 for That Certain Summer.[21]

Ceremony information[edit]
Nate Bargatze hosted the ceremony.
On March 5, 2025, the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences, also known as the Television Academy, announced that the 77th Primetime Emmy Awards would be held on September 14.[28] CBS broadcast the ceremony as part of a rotating deal among the "Big Four" networks (ABC, CBS, Fox, and NBC) signed in 2018.[29]
Additionally, it was announced that the ceremony would be available live and on-demand via Paramount Skydance's streaming service Paramount+.[28] The ceremony was produced by Jesse Collins Entertainment (Jesse Collins, Dionne Harmon, and Jeannae Rouzan-Clay) for the third consecutive year.[30] On April 16, comedian Nate Bargatze was announced as the ceremony's host.[31]
During a press conference held on September 11 promoting the show, producer Collins announced that the ceremony would feature reunions in tribute to the 25th anniversaries of The WB and CW comedy-drama series Gilmore Girls and CBS reality competition series Survivor, and the 35th anniversary of NBC's police procedural franchise Law & Order. Furthermore, the telecast would pay tribute to the 40th anniversary of the NBC sitcom The Golden Girls with country singer Reba McEntire and Little Big Town's Karen Fairchild and Kimberly Schlapman performing the series' theme song, "Thank You for Being a Friend".[32] Eric Dane and Jesse Williams were initially scheduled as co-presenters to honor the 20th anniversary of ABC medical drama Grey's Anatomy, but Dane was absent from the ceremony while Williams presented alone. According to Collins, he told reporters for Variety after the awards ceremony, "I just was told that he wasn't able to make it, and fortunately, Jesse was able to present by himself."[33]
In an effort to shorten winner's acceptance speeches and have the telecast run on time, Bargatze announced that he would donate $100,000 to the Boys & Girls Club of America. However, for every second an award winner's speech went over the 45-second limit $1,000 would be deducted from the donation.[34] Similarly, for every second under the limit another $1,000 would be added.[35] At the end of the show, Bargatze stated that CBS would donate the full $100,000 to the charity, and that he would add an additional $250,000.[36]
Several other individuals were involved with the production of the telecast. Alex Rudzinski and Rickey Minor served as director and musical director for the ceremony, respectively.[37] Entertainment Tonight co-anchors Kevin Frazier and Nischelle Turner hosted a red carpet pre-show preceding the telecast.[38] Comedians Mikey Day, James Austin Johnson, and Bowen Yang participated in an opening comedy sketch with Bargatze parodying how Philo Farnsworth invented television similar to the "Washington's Dream" sketch featured on a 50th season episode of Saturday Night Live.[39]
Category and rule changes[edit]
On January 8, 2025, the Television Academy announced rule changes that affected the directing and guest performer awards. Starting with the 77th ceremony, individuals or directing teams are permitted to submit multiple episodes for consideration in the directing categories, provided that the episodes are from different programs. In previous years, directors or directing teams could only submit one entry per category.[40] Additionally, any performer who previously won or has been nominated in the lead or supporting acting categories would be ineligible to submit a performance of the same character in the same series for consideration in the guest performance categories in subsequent years.[41]
On July 22, 2025, it was announced that Outstanding Writing for a Variety Series would be presented at the main ceremony, replacing Outstanding Writing for a Variety Special, which was presented at the Creative Arts ceremony held on September 7.[42] Two weeks later, the Television Academy moved the presentation for Outstanding Variety Special (Live) to the main ceremony as well.[43]
Critical reviews and viewership[edit]
The broadcast generally received mixed to negative reviews from critics.[44]
The ceremony was viewed by 7.59 million people in the United States, making it the most-viewed Emmys in four years, representing a 10% increase over the previous year's ceremony.[45] It also achieved a 1.28 rating among adults ages 18–49.[45] Ratings figures included those who watched the telecast on CBS or streamed it on Paramount+.[46]
In Memoriam[edit]
The annual In Memoriam segment was presented by Phylicia Rashad, and featured Vince Gill and Lainey Wilson performing Gill's song "Go Rest High on That Mountain".[47]
