National variations of the English language have been widely discussed previously:
Wikipedia does not favor any particular variety of English.
While Wikipedia aims to use language common to all English varieties, some differences in spelling, grammar, or terminology may differ or be absent in a reader's preferred variety.
For guidance, see the relevant style guide on the national varieties of English and the comparison of American and British English.

Purge this page
Where is the error? An exact quotation using {{!xt}} of the text in question helps.
Offer a correction if possible using {{xt}}.
References are helpful, especially when reporting an obscure factual or grammatical error.
Time zones. The Main Page runs on Coordinated Universal Time (UTC, currently 00:17 on 26 September 2025) and is not adjusted to your local time zone.
Can you resolve the problem yourself? If the error lies primarily in the content of an article linked from the Main Page, fix the problem there before reporting it here. Text on the Main Page generally defers to the articles with bolded links. Upcoming content on the Main Page is usually only protected from editing beginning 24 hours before its scheduled appearance. Before that period, you can be bold and fix any issues yourself.
Do not use {{edit fully-protected}} on this page, which will not get a faster response. It is unnecessary, because this page is not protected, and causes display problems. (See the bottom of this revision for an example.)
No chit-chat. Lengthy discussions should be moved to a suitable location elsewhere, such as the talk page of the relevant article or project.
Actual errors only. Failures of subjective criteria such as interestingness are not errors.
Respect other editors. Another user wrote the text you want changed, or reported an issue they see in something you wrote. Everyone's goal should be producing the best Main Page possible. The compressed time frame of the Main Page means sometimes action must be taken before there has been time for everyone to comment. Be civil to fellow users.
Reports are removed when resolved. Once an error has been addressed or determined not to be an error, or the item has been rotated off the Main Page, the report will be removed from this page. Check the revision history for a record of any discussion or action taken; no archives are kept.
Administrators: Clear all reports

Change "was" to "is" in the lead sentence per MOS:WAS and per the article itself. Loytra✨ 11:06, 25 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
"Was" was changed to "is" by this edit about three hours ago, well into the TFA day, along with other significant changes may generate reversions or discussions. Consistency with day-of changes is not a good reason for a modification to the blurb because there hasn't been time to see if others agree with what happened. And I have my doubts as to whether MOS:WAS dictates present tense since it suggests, "Generally, use past tense only for past events". The fashion show is over, and the FAC version, which passed unremarked was "was". Wehwalt (talk) 11:31, 25 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
FWIW I agree with the OP here. Joan is not a fashion show, but a collection of clothing designed in that year, which still exists in the sense that one could still wear those clothes today, and similar to an album, film or book released then, which would also be present tense. There is a POTD entry featuring another McQueen collection scheduled for tomorrow and we've gone with present tense there.  — Amakuru (talk) 12:16, 25 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Courtesy ping to Premeditated Chaos as the FAC nominator. UndercoverClassicist T·C 14:16, 25 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The clothes can be worn, no doubt, but then why do we assign a date to it? (removed from the article by the same editor, still present in blurb). It's complex. Let's see what PMC has to say. Wehwalt (talk) 14:45, 25 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

"1903 – Alfred Deakin became the second Australian prime minister, succeeding Edmund Barton, who left office to become a founding justice of the High Court of Australia."
This is not supported by either the Alfred Deakin or the List of justices of the High Court of Australia article. Deakin is not stated to have ever been a justice of the court, though he did appoint five of the first six.
Of the justices, only Barton was an Australian prime minister (according to the list). —DocWatson42 (talk) 21:24, 25 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
"1066 – Harold Godwinson defeated King Harald III of Norway and his English ally Tostig Godwinson at the Battle of Stamford Bridge, ending the last Norse invasion of the British Isles." last part is incorrect; at the very least, Sweyn II of Denmark invaded Northumbria in 1069.
