National variations of the English language have been widely discussed previously:
Wikipedia does not favor any particular variety of English.
While Wikipedia aims to use language common to all English varieties, some differences in spelling, grammar, or terminology may differ or be absent in a reader's preferred variety.
For guidance, see the relevant style guide on the national varieties of English and the comparison of American and British English.

Purge this page
Where is the error? An exact quotation using {{!xt}} of the text in question helps.
Offer a correction if possible using {{xt}}.
References are helpful, especially when reporting an obscure factual or grammatical error.
Time zones. The Main Page runs on Coordinated Universal Time (UTC, currently 00:05 on 23 September 2025) and is not adjusted to your local time zone.
Can you resolve the problem yourself? If the error lies primarily in the content of an article linked from the Main Page, fix the problem there before reporting it here. Text on the Main Page generally defers to the articles with bolded links. Upcoming content on the Main Page is usually only protected from editing beginning 24 hours before its scheduled appearance. Before that period, you can be bold and fix any issues yourself.
Do not use {{edit fully-protected}} on this page, which will not get a faster response. It is unnecessary, because this page is not protected, and causes display problems. (See the bottom of this revision for an example.)
No chit-chat. Lengthy discussions should be moved to a suitable location elsewhere, such as the talk page of the relevant article or project.
Actual errors only. Failures of subjective criteria such as interestingness are not errors.
Respect other editors. Another user wrote the text you want changed, or reported an issue they see in something you wrote. Everyone's goal should be producing the best Main Page possible. The compressed time frame of the Main Page means sometimes action must be taken before there has been time for everyone to comment. Be civil to fellow users.
Reports are removed when resolved. Once an error has been addressed or determined not to be an error, or the item has been rotated off the Main Page, the report will be removed from this page. Check the revision history for a record of any discussion or action taken; no archives are kept.
Administrators: Clear all reports

Errors with "In the news"
Terence Crawford
"Terence Crawford defeats Canelo Álvarez, becoming undisputed world champion in three weight classes" is misleading at best. Henry Armstrong was the only person to hold titles in three weight classes simultaneously. In defeating Álvarez, Crawford became undisputed world champion in one weight class, namely super middleweight. He was at different earlier times undisputed world champion in two other weight classes (light welterweight and welterweight) but not since well before the Álvarez fight. I suggest changing "becoming undisputed world champion in three weight classes" to "becoming undisputed world super middleweight champion" and leaving the finicky three-class trivia to the article itself. 09:42, 22 September 2025 (UTC)
Any reason why you don't sign your post with your username, Jnestorius? I, for one, don't understand boxing and cannot comment on the proposed wording change. Schwede66 10:08, 22 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
A glance at my edit history will show that I do as a rule sign my posts. This instance was a rare mistake due to forgetting that I had clicked "edit" rather than "reply": the latter editor auto-signs one's post, the former does not. jnestorius(talk) 10:20, 22 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Ta. All good. Schwede66 12:28, 22 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Image question for upcoming DYK Halloween nomination
cosplay of Freddy Kreuger
display of characters glove
For an upcoming Halloween DYK nomination I have been writing an article on a Japanese flatworm genus named after Freddy Kreuger (see the type illustration for the reason).
I'd like to get clarification as to if this image is main page compliant for the nomination, im uncertain due to the cosplay aspects vrs the character being cosplayed. Thanks --Kevmin § 18:26, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The fictional character is subject to copyright. That stops you from using the image. It should be deleted from Commons. Schwede66 07:26, 20 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Schwede66: Noted, what about this image, which is not the clearest but is already used in the Freddy article?--Kevmin § 18:59, 20 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I wouldn’t have any concerns. Schwede66 19:55, 20 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
