Cross & Cross (1907–1942)[1] was a New York City-based architectural firm founded by brothers John Walter Cross and Eliot Cross.
History[edit]
Cross & Cross was known as Old New York City Society's architectural firm of choice.[2] John Cross (1878–1951) studied architecture at the Columbia University and the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, and served as the creative half of the partnership, while Eliot Cross (1884–1949) focused on the development side of the business, particularly through his role as Chairman of the Board of the real estate development firm of Webb and Knapp, which he organized in 1922.[3] The two firms shared office space in the Knapp Building on Madison Avenue.[3] In 1942, John Cross was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate Academician.[4]
