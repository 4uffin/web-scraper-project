IP Peer Review.[edit]
Peer Review Guidelines is not clear on whether IP editors can nominate for PR. Though I won't remember to do it by the time I get home. I know intellectually that its unlikely due to IP editors not being able to create pages however.
I'm going to be checking every few hours while I am at this district.

I see nothing to prevent an IP address from requesting a peer review. The only thing that would stop you is a semi-protected talk page. Otherwise, just follow the instructions. ~Anachronist (talk) 14:48, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Yep, can't create the PR page

OK. I don't understand why you can't log into one account from school, and log into another account from home. ~Anachronist (talk) 21:13, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
because I can't log in within Georgetown Independent School District at all. The district decided to remove access to central auth early last school year. The only possible way for me to log in is if an WP:ADMIN moved User:IPOfAFlower to a local (enwiki) account. 24.155.147.109 (talk) 13:36, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

yes. They are generally very stubborn about re-enabling things for some reason. Flower (she/her; User talk:IPOfAFlower) 22:57, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

why allow paid editing?[edit]
hello! I have a question. why is it that wikipedia permits paid editing to occur at all? right now, paid editors have to declare their COI, which is nice, but to me at least it would make more sense to ban paid editing entirely. given all of the scams, and wasted time, and useless questions, and disruptive editors, I think it would be better to make paid editing and COI editing against wikipedia policy. after all, wikimedia doesn't get compensated for paid editing work or anything. of course, I'm not demanding this decades-old policy be changed immediately. I'm just genuinely curious. that's all. thanks! 67.218.119.178 (talk) 22:12, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The consensus of the Wikipedia community has been that if we were to ban paid editing, the paid editors would probably still edit here but would not admit it and thus be more difficult to regulate. MrOllie (talk) 22:20, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
We highly discourage paid editors from editing articles directly. Some of them have useful suggestions, and as for the rest: I expect that people are more likely to comply with disclosure and editing requirements than to respect a strict ban. And given that our scam warning hasn't kept scammers from promising they can publish and protect articles (or alternatively threaten to delete them, as blackmail), I doubt announcing a strict ban would affect them much either. jlwoodwa (talk) 22:24, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I hadn't known that we have paid editors. If they are discouraged from editing articles directly, then what do they edit? I'm just curious; I have no interest in being one. Maurice Magnus (talk) 22:57, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
For existing articles, they can edit talk pages and make edit requests; for new articles, they can create them in draftspace and submit them to Articles for creation. jlwoodwa (talk) 23:00, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
They can also, for example, edit directly if they are reverting egregious vandalism; making uncontroversial factual updates or technical fixes; or adding uncontroversial and non-promotional citations; all providing that appropriate declarations are made. They can also make edits suggested via the edit request process, if they are invited to so so by an independent editor. And see WP:CURATOR. Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 16:42, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Maurice Magnus, "assistance with writing a wikipedia page" (above) may interest you. -- Hoary (talk) 07:52, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Not all paid editors are ill-intentioned scammers! For example, it's quite likely that when there's a staff reshuffle at a university, and there's a new vice-chancellor, it will be some random member of faculty, grad student or post-doc who first notices that Wikipedia hasn't caught up. They aren't necessarily employed by the university's comms department, but because they're employed by the university, they're paid editors. They are, however, quite useful. Elemimele (talk) 12:55, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Some paid editors are very helpful in keeping articles up-to-date. Some I interact with provide relevant photographs and suggest new sources that can be used: all via article talk pages, as required by the COI provisions. Mike Turnbull (talk) 13:19, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

--pro-anti-air ping me for template replies 22:29, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Pro-anti-air: If it is open source you can import and change the code. However using Wikipedia should
follow the policies here, and also I hope the user understands what they are doing. Normally you should get more experience with doing things manually before using an automated tool. Otherwise you won't understand what the tool is doing. Auto/confirmed is not a big hurdle. In fact you are an extended confirmed user, so I expect you already have the experience to understand what it does. Graeme Bartlett (talk) 07:02, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Graeme Bartlett I mean User:AntoEh/twinkle.js, but they are probably autoconfirmed by now.

Citations look weird. Help?[edit]
Can someone verify these articles look okay to you? I enjoy contributing to Wiki and these citations look weird to me even though they check out on crossref for me.
https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1284381/[https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC945](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9458805/)
In case you‚Äôre interested in my discussion about the difference between assistive devices and Psychotherapy you can find what I‚Äôve written so far here: User talk:Bogwife. 2600:8802:5517:C300:1C43:C86B:BA9E:FC2A (talk) 21:33, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Whether "these articles look okay" to us in which sense? Whichever Wikipedia article each of these is or might be used on, the Wikipedia article has a talk page; and it's on that talk page that you can ask about the looking-okay-ness of this or that potential source. Though you should be a lot clearer than "[looking] okay to you". Also, be sure to be logged in as Bogwife when you ask, and indeed when you edit in general. -- Hoary (talk) 22:33, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Certificates look fine. But there‚Äôs no WHOIS page for the URLs. Seems like potentially AI-generated and malicious but very subtle? Bogwife (talk) 00:04, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Bogwife Your Talk page starts with "thank you!".
It's not clear who you are thanking.
And it says "I agree with you" and I agree" in a couple of other places.
Who is "you"? David10244 (talk) 22:52, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The first journal looks okay, nothing initially comes up when I look for people discussing it being predatory. In general, I would do that journals as many of them have not been discussed at WP:RSN or WP:RSP. Also, be heavily mindful of WP:MEDRS and note that my strategy is likely not foolproof. ‚ú∂Quxyz‚ú∂ (talk) 22:50, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Also, do note that because of how you formatted the link, the articles are rather awkward to access. ‚ú∂Quxyz‚ú∂ (talk) 22:52, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
A single 2013 study on three children doi:10.1901/jaba.2002.35-213, which is the first link above, will not pass our WP:MEDRS requirement for sources. Mike Turnbull (talk) 11:19, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
That's pretty much why I only analyzed the journal's credentials as to if it was predatory or not; I do not want to finick with MEDRS as I am relatively unqualified in analyzing a source to that level as my fields (history and earth sciences) do not require such depth. ‚ú∂Quxyz‚ú∂ (talk) 13:37, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
When you call it "your discussion", for me that causes a sort of alarm bell. For Wikipedia, it needs to be someone else's discussion. All you can be in the article is a reporter - not a discusser. TooManyFingers (talk) 06:02, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I'm not sure I understand what you're asking.
Your citation should look like this:
1.^ Charlop-Christy, Marjorie H.; Carpenter, Michael; Le, Loc; LeBlanc, Linda A.; Kellet, Kristen (2002). "Using the picture exchange communication system (PECS) with children with autism: assessment of PECS acquisition, speech, social-communicative behavior, and problem behavior".

Sfn & harv[edit]
Hi, friends. I need help because, as always with very "technical or glitchy issues" of references or citations, I do not grasp it fully. I am working on a DYK nomination which I submitted today, and I am a very aesthetic editor, LOL. I think it is great to have books under a different subhead than general references. But I got an error which I don't understand in one of those book citations. Can anybody help me? I've tried myself but I can't decode the error. It's on the article about Lifeboat No. 6 of the Titanic.
Thanks. A lot. Love. CoryGlee (talk) 00:51, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The source Gracie, Archibald; Thayer, John B. (2014). Titanic A Survivor's Story & the Sinking of the S.S. Titanic. Chicago Review Press. ISBN¬†9780897336758. is defined twice, once in the History section and once in the Repeated cited sources section. This means that {{sfn}}, when it's looking for the correct citation, sees two "different" books which could match. You should combine the twin citations by replacing the History citation with {{sfn}} instead.
Minor note, but I think Repeated cited sources is typically called Bibliography. Blepbob (talk) 01:46, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Fixed. Cremastra (talk¬†¬∑ contribs) 02:02, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@CoryGlee, I think this has mostly already been covered, but if you copy the link from a shortened footnote you'll see "#CITEREFGracieThayer2014" or something similar at the end. This is just a basic HTML anchor and a standard part of the web. Each anchor name should be used on a single full citation. If the same name is duplicated across multiple full citations on a page, it's not clear which target the shortened footnote links are meant to point towards.
That's the full explanation for the cryptic error, "Harv error: duplicate target for CITEREFGracieThayer2014." "Harv error" means it is related to sfn/harv citations, "duplicate target" means there are multiple identical anchor names, and "CITEREFGracieThayer2014" is the anchor name that was duplicated. Rjjiii (talk) 09:29, 20 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
New editor, question about WP:NPOV[edit]
Hi All,
I was reviewing this article and I came across this passage:
"Students of Nalanda College have consistently participated in national-level examinations, with some achieving high grades in Ordinary Level and Advanced Level exams, as well as in various sports competitions." This passage feels extremely out of place to me, however it has tons of citations on it. There is also an "Awards" section immediately below this that seems address this idea with objective facts.
So do we think this is an appropriate passage? As a new editor, how do I know when a passage is in violation of WP:NPOV if it has citations as well?
TIA,
LuredFreezer LuredFreezer (talk) 16:10, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
As long as the sources are well-referenced, and the references actually back up the information, it seems good to me. It's written in a somewhat braggadocious-seeming way, but it's pretty much just statistics. If you think it could be written in a more encyclopedic way, I invite you to Be Bold and correct it in a manner that you feel is appropriate.
Happy editing!
Commandant Quacks-a-lot (talk) 18:17, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I think maybe NPOV (in its Wikipedia sense) is not exactly the problem, even though neutrality is certainly involved. The issue (if there is one) seems more like WP:COI or WP:Puff, if you think the article is misusing Wikipedia as a promotional tool. (I too would tend to classify this kind of thing as inappropriate promotional material.) TooManyFingers (talk) 18:23, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Thanks to both, this is helpful. I'll noodle on it for a bit and see if I can reword it in a way that feels more fitting for Wikipedia. LuredFreezer (talk) 18:26, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
It's also possible to delete material if it's not appropriate; rewording is not the only way. Many times, something is true but (for reasons other than truth) doesn't belong in an article. TooManyFingers (talk) 18:32, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I've had a look at the 12 references which follow this statement. I think the sentence is synthesis. The references each list one or several students from the school who have achieved high grades. The coverage is mostly passing mentions. I would consider taking out the sentence and related refs. If one of the sources said something along the lines of "Nalanda College students consistently perform well in examinations", that would be different.
On a separate point, I would also consider removing the reference to https://studentlanka.com, as I'm not sure that is a reliable source.
For the three references after this sentence which relate to two former students who are notable for their sporting achievements, I would remove the references from the school article, which does not mention these people, and add the refs at List of Nalanda College Colombo alumni.
You could also ask at WP:WikiProject Schools. Tacyarg (talk) 22:28, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Non-English words query[edit]
While editing a page, I came across non-English word that was hyperlinked, so should it be italicized as well? Can I get some guidance around this?
ReaderAlvarez (talk) 00:46, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
It might depend on the word; some non-English words have become sufficiently well used in English that they are no longer considered to need italicisation.
That aside, I agree it would be consistent, so I suggest you be Bold and go ahead,: the worst that can happen is that someone disagrees and Reverts your edit, wheupon you can both Discuss the matter on the Talk page ‚Äì this is the Wikipedia:BRD cycle that is normal procedure in Wikipedia.
As with my bolding of that link, the italics markers go outside the double brackets (which you may already have known). {The poster formerly known as 87.81.230.195} 90.193.153.108 (talk) 01:31, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

@ReaderAlvarez: Assuming that the hyperlink is a wikilink, one rule of thumb is to click on the wikilink and see if the term is or is not italicized in the article about the topic. Deor (talk) 15:42, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Moving redirects[edit]
I plan on moving the redirect Scarlet red from Sudan IV to Scarlet (color). Is that okay. It's fine if it's not. Cheeky91021 (talk) 21:44, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Cheeky91021 I think that the current redirect is owing to "scarlet red" being a synonym of the chemical, as listed in its entry in ChemSpider. Anyone typing "scarlet" in the search bar is going to be offered the DAB page and Scarlet (color) as some of the options. Only by continuing to type the whole "scarlet red" will they get the dye, so I think the present situation is fine. Mike Turnbull (talk) 22:00, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Perhaps you could create a disambiguation page for it? I would discuss your rationale for creating it in the new disambig page's talk page for other editors to see. Commandant Quacks-a-lot (talk) 22:34, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Scarlet is a DAB page but currently doesn't include Scarlet red. Mike Turnbull (talk) 11:46, 20 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Hello, @Stefan85xx. That is the purpose of review. We don't normally do pre-reviews. ColinFine (talk) 10:43, 20 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I see ColinFine's comment that we don't normally do pre-reviews, but I just had a look, and to me the whole article still looks very much like advertising. The problem (as I see it) is not style, but content. The whole article is set up to show what this company can offer me if I do business with them, and how I can become their customer ‚Äì most or all of that needs to be deleted. A Wikipedia article shows mainly (taking almost all of the words in the article) how the company has been seen in the past by the general public who are not doing business with them. We want to merely collect and show the information that any member of the general public could already find in the public library and the news. We don't want any information that wasn't already communicated to the public by reliable sources unrelated to the company (or only a little of that).

Draft Article Declined[edit]
Hi! I've recently been working on my first article and am having trouble getting it accepted. The article is about a film writer, director, and producer who is highly cited across the internet and in entertainment media news and is the winner of several industry awards, yet doesn't seem to have a page. (The name of this filmmaker is Ari Katcher.) He's show running the new adaptation of Jennette McCurdy's memoir I'm Glad My Mom Died for Apple TV+ starring Jennifer Aniston, so I believe he will continue to pick up notoriety as the series progresses and it would be great to start a Wikipedia profile. My draft article has been declined twice now for the same reasoning of "notability / not enough reliable, independent secondary sources cited."
The first time I submitted, the majority of my citations about his work credits were pulled from IMDb, which I understand is an editable cite, so maybe not recognized as an independent source. However, in preparation for my resubmission, I added several articles from various reputable entertainment news outlets, including Deadline, Hollywood Reporter, Variety, and Vanity Fair, as well as the official sites of the organizations that granted Ari his several industry awards. My resubmission was still declined for the same reasoning though. I'm wondering if anyone could take a look at the page and let me know if there is something different I should be including to help this page be accepted? Here is the link to the draft article: Draft:Ari Katcher Xor19nemr16 (talk) 15:58, 20 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Please read WP:RS to see what is meant by reliable sources. TooManyFingers (talk) 16:03, 20 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Some feedback for you:
Delete all of the IMDB citations
Only the O'Falt source discusses him in any significant manner. The others only mention him in passing. Suggest you find at least one more source that discusses him for about 250 or more words.
Btw: all you've really got so far is the lead of the article. That could be enough for a stub but you should really be aiming to write sections Early life and education, Career, Awards and Recognition. A Personal Life section isn't obligatory but you'll probably find information as you do more research.

Birth date sourcing[edit]
On the page for Carlos Fernandes (activist) I want to include the Facebook funeral announcement from the NGO he was a founder of, Iris Angola, as a source his date of birth.
For context, other news outlets do not provide his birth date. Some say he was 41, but according the funeral announcement from Iris Angola, he was 40 at the time of his passing. Considering this is the only source that gives a date of birth at all, and considering it would be odd for the organization he founded to get his birthday wrong, I think it should be used for date of birth.
However, it is a self-published source (a Facebook post) which typically isn't allowed. I verified the Facebook account is legitimate and does belong to the real Iris Angola since another news source, the Bay Area Reporter, linked to it saying it was Iris.
Is this use of a self published source allowed given the circumstances? Thanks.¬†Urchincrawler (talk) 01:25, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Draft Submisson: Quick Question[edit]

Hi and welcome to Wikipedia! Articles for Creation can take a while. There's no specific order in which submissions are reviewed. However, I did take a quick look at your article, and I think you should add more references. Because you are writing about a living person, it is really important that all the details you include have references to reliable sources. For example, in the Early life section, I would want to see:
A source for her birthplace
A source that talks about her early years (or cut that section)
A source for her participation at Toru≈Ñski Klub Karate Shotokan
A source for her university degree
The sources that you've cited at the bottom of the article might include those details. I don't read Polish, so I'm not sure. But it's important that you cite a source for the fact right after the sentence, not just later in the article (so the source is still there if other parts of the article are edited).
If you got the facts from somewhere else--like an unreliable source, AI, or from knowing the subject personally--then they don't belong in the article, and should be removed.
I hope is helpful feedback! SomeoneDreaming (talk) 01:47, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

What have they been saying is wrong with it? TooManyFingers (talk) 02:10, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Thanks for the quick reply...This submission's references do not show that the subject qualifies for a Wikipedia article‚Äîthat is, they do not show significant coverage (not just passing mentions) about the subject in published, reliable, secondary sources that are independent of the subject (see the guidelines on the notability of people). Before any resubmission, additional references meeting these criteria should be added (see technical help and learn about mistakes to avoid when addressing this issue). If no additional references exist, the subject is not suitable for Wikipedia. Mesomay (talk) 02:15, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I see. Unfortunately, the only way to fix this problem is to find those references they talked about. It means that so far, the article's references are the wrong kind. Does that make sense? TooManyFingers (talk) 02:52, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Everybody knows that Wikipedia must have an article about Einstein, one of the most important figures in 20th-century science.
Everybody knows that Wikipedia must NOT have an article about me, because I am not important to the rest of the world, only to me and a few people who know me.
Almost every person is in between: they are more notable than me, but less notable than Einstein. To have an article about them, we have to prove they are notable. (It's easy to prove Einstein is notable, and impossible to prove I am notable.) TooManyFingers (talk) 03:01, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Thank you so much for your response. I think I understand what you are saying. My subject is definitely notable in New Zealand, which is evidenced by the number of awards she has won in business and fashion. I can find examples of other New Zealanders with less notoriety and they have used media sources aswell. Are you able to access the draft? Mesomay (talk) 04:57, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Awards don't help unless the awards themselves are notable awards. (On a different topic, think of those "car of the year" awards that the carmakers always give to each other and that nobody follows.) Published material (independent sources choosing to write articles about her work without interviewing her, for example) is worth a lot more. Have you carefully read the requirements listed in the message you got? Those requirements are tailored to your particular situation - it's not just a form letter that everyone gets.

This is about Draft:Annah Stretton 2 (started by Mesomay); not to be confused with Draft:Annah Stretton (about the same person, and started by RKLET). "Media source" is a term that covers anything from scrupulously compiled material read for enlightenment and/or pleasure (and for which one would willingly pay money) all the way down to uncritically recycled PR bumf. There is no simple relationship between (A) degree of fame (or "notoriety") and (B) notability (as understood here). -- Hoary (talk) 07:38, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

I don't understand why when I type {{Vandalism} Wikipedia says "This user may meet Wikipedia's criteria for speedy deletion as pure vandalism"
I was just editing my own page,not the pages that viewers see oftenly and I said in my own page "A bunch of my edits appeared vandalism to other editors even when I provided the sources, so If anyone can teach me how to not appear vandalism even when I provided the source, I appreciate him" I just want to be a better editor and to not appear vandalism,But when I tried to link Vandalism, Wikipedia says I'm pure vandalism, I'm just editing my own page!

@My planet is Homlos welcome to Teashouse! you're trying to do the right thing and I want to reassure you: you are not going to get banned just for making good-faith mistakes everyone here started as a new editor and learning the rules can be confusing at first. I'm not sure why you try to put {{Vandalism}} temp on you userpage the template is not meant for user pages that's why Wikipedia gave you the scary message it doesn‚Äôt mean you are vandalizing it‚Äôs just the template's purpose. If you want to link to vandalism use double square brackets like this: [[Vandalism]]... And also Sometimes other editors may remove or question edits if they aren't clearly sourced don't match the style guidelines or look like opinion or speculation... That doesn't mean you're being accused of bad intent. Wikipedia has a strict policy about verifiability (see WP:V) so even good edits can get reverted if the sourcing isn‚Äôt crystal clear...
About your user page: You're absolutely allowed to have a personal page (within user page guidelines) but templates like {{Vandalism}} have special meanings and should not be used there... If you just want to mention the word vandalism typing [[Vandalism]] will make a safe link to the article
Here's the best advice I can give don't be afraid. You're clearly editing in good faith and that's what matters most. If something gets reverted treat it as a chance to learn and feel free to ask the reverting editor politely on their talk page why.
You're very welcome here and with time you'll get more comfortable. Please don't think about banning yourself

Finding sources for book series[edit]
Hi there, I've been editing for the Nevermoor book series for a while now, with the fourth book in the series being released in April this year. Unfortunately, no page has been created for this fourth book because except for this ABC article, I haven't been able to find anything that qualifies the book as even mildly notable. A few reviews, sure, but they're not from reliable/notable sources and mostly talk about the author's 4 year hiatus and not the contents of the book itself. So - any advice? Is it still too soon? And if it is, should I make a draft of the book's topic and themes etc or hold off until notability can be proven? Thanks!¬†:)
Cornonthehunt (talk) 04:23, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I think it might be a bit too soon for a standalone article tho
since there isn‚Äôt much independent coverage yet (see WP:NBOOK) but for now you could add sourced info about the fourth book to the main The Nevermoor series article and also I think a draft in your userspace would be better until stronger coverage appears.¬†:) ThilioR O B O Tü§ñ talk 05:04, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hi there! I have no comment on the merits of this particular book or series, so this is a general comment about finding reviews. I have spent some time looking for them myself, and have had solid luck using EBSCOhost and Gale to search for reviews that aren't available through search engines. If you make 500 edits and have an account that is at least 6 months old, you can access these databases, and others, for free through the Wikipedia Library. Depending on your situation, a nearby school/university or public library may also subscribe to database services that could help you find sources.
In my experience, there is no guarantee these reviews will be available on the service even if they're indexed there, and you might still have to do some hunting to find them. But, if you can get an idea of if this particular book probably meets WP:NBOOK or that it probably does not, that could inform your choice about creating a draft of some kind.

Hello Andy.
Rovos Rail is a 'pocket of excellence' when it comes to South African tourism ‚Äì widly regarded as one of the best luxury train experiences globally. However I notice that Rovos Rail focuses on a derailment ‚Äì to some extent overshadowing Rovos‚Äô success and benefits that it brings to regional tourism- in a remarkably challenging Southern African rail environment.
Ceres Rail Company focuses on the restoration of both freight and tourist rail services within the Western Cape province of South Africa to; (1) reduce traffic congestion in Cape Town, caused in part by booming regional tourism and property sectors, and;(2) promote tourism in outlying rural regions of the Western Cape, notably Elgin, South Africa
and Ceres, South Africa, in addition to occasionally Darling, Simon's Town and overnight trips to Mossell Bay. Recently Ceres Rail Company has added Botrivier as a destination which will enhance the tourism appeal of another rural town.
Ceres Rail Company retains skills from former Transnet (State Logics Company) employees to maintain and restore heritage locomotives, such as South African Class 26 4-8-4 and rollingstock including the Union Limited, formerly Blue Train (South Africa) and more recently the restoration of rail infostructure. CRC‚Äôs other primary focus is enabling the migration of road freight to rail from Ceres, the leading fruit growing region of South Africa, to the Port of Cape Town. Unfortunately the Michell's Pass branch line was severely damaged during floods in June 2023. CRC is now endeavoring to restorage the railway through the pass at its own cost in order to restore the freight and tourism rail services between Cape Town and Ceres.
The restoration of freight rail services provides significant benefits to the region, including reduced damage to provincial roads, reduced logistics costs for exports, reduced truck induced road accidents and reduced congestion in the City of Cape Town. In the context of the incident you mention, as you have pointed out, the experienced locomotive crew was able to brake hard to avoid the train heading into parked rail wagons, which unfortunately caused some passengers to be thrown forward. Fortunately, the incident was not severe to an extent that it required the involvement of the company‚Äôs Public Liability Insurance provider. However in an ideal world the incident mentioned shouldn‚Äôt overshadow the mission of restoring rail operations in the Western Cape.
The reasons why I‚Äôm looking into Wikipedia in the context of Ceres Rail Company are¬†;(1) numerous Wikipedia search results make references to Ceres Rail Company, without it obviously having a Wikipedia page and (2) AI generated search results contain a surprising amount of misinformation or Hallucination (artificial intelligence) I figured that a dedicated Wikipedia page could help remedy the above.
Apologies for not being able to keep my response to a few lines.

I agree about reading WP:SCAM, first.
I want to add that hiring a content creator for a Wikipedia article is very much like hiring a "money creator" at the very moment you need to buy something. Buying something requires you to have the money already, and no matter how qualified an expert is, they can't create money.
In the same way, the content of a Wikipedia article is strictly limited to the content that already existed before you start, and no expert is able to just create some for you.
(In fact getting an article on Wikipedia is even more strict than needing money before you buy something, because Wikipedia can't defer its requirements about legitimate content that already existed. No credit card exists for this.) TooManyFingers (talk) 19:22, 22 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The point is Simon Le May Beckett, that appeals to other editors to write an article for you (for whatever reason) don't often work, because everybody here is a volunteer that chooses what they spend their time on. If you are lucky enough to catch somebody's interest, so they want to work on it: great; but that doesn't often happen.
So most of the time, if you want an article writing, the most likely way to make that happen is to do it yourself. The articles for creation process is designed for (among other things) people with a COI to create articles even with their COI.
Having said that, creating an article is the most difficult and challenging task for new editors. My earnest advice to new editors is to not even think about
trying to create an article until you have spent several weeks - at least - learning about how Wikipedia works by making improvements to existing articles. Once you have understood core policies such as verifiability, neutral point of view, reliable, independent sources, and notability, and experienced how we handle disagreements with other editors (the Bold, Revert, Discuss cycle), then you might be ready to read your first article carefully, and try creating a draft. If you don't follow this advice but try to create an article without this preparation, you are likely to have a frustrating and disappointing experience with Wikipedia. And that's even without a COI.
It's possible that you will find somebody interested in working with you on this at WikiProject Trains; but don't hold your breath. --ColinFine (talk) 19:18, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

non-digital clipping as a reference[edit]
How can I use a newspaper clipping as a source when the newspaper (club magazine, neighborhood bulletin) doesn't have a digital archive? Ultimately, my clipping is the only source availlable until any papertigers come up with additions later (or never). Yet, the clippings contain useful information. Robbert Ritmeester (talk) 11:59, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Robbert Ritmeester You can use the template TM:Cite news normally, even without a URL. Just input any information you have, like the article title, newspaper, page number, author, and date. WP:OFFLINE explains why this is okay. Toadspike [Talk] 12:09, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
This is true, while keeping in mind that the requirements for reliability of sources still apply. If the paper that the clippings come from is reliable enough for what it's being used for, then it doesn't matter what format it was originally published in. But if it was a newsletter published in the subject's friend's basement, it's still not going to count. TooManyFingers (talk) 12:32, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
How would that work out for these examples:

sources such as TV or podcast interviews[edit]
I'm writing an entry about a singer. His current band has a Wikipedia entry. Some of the information, such as the fact he has ADHD, is taken from radio, podcast and national TV interviews.

You can cite interviews, but note that if he is the one saying it, rather than an interviewer, it's a primary source and a non-independent one. Just don't base the whole article off things he says. Interviews mostly don't contribute to notability, but they are fine as sources. As for how to cite them -- I like to use the dedicated citation templates, like {{Cite podcast}}, etc. Mrfoogles (talk) 14:47, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Things that interviewers say in interviews are often things they would not say if the subject wasn't there. There isn't a strong division like "subject=unreliable and interviewer=reliable"; interviews are overall less reliable no matter who is speaking. (It depends on the situation though.) TooManyFingers (talk) 19:47, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hello, @◊™◊û◊ô ◊†◊ô◊†◊ô◊ï, and welcome to the Teahouse.
The first and most importnt thing you need to do in writing a new article is to show that you have enough sources, each of which meets all the criteria in the golden rule, to establish that the subject meets Wikipedia's criteria for notability. If you cannot find such sources, then you will not be able to write an acceptable article, and should spend no further time trying.
Note that notability is not inherited: just because there is enough published about his band to base an article on, does not guarantee that there is enough published about him to do so. ColinFine (talk) 19:25, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Reusing citations[edit]
If a citation/reference I used supports more than one fact in an entry, e.g., it states both a person's place of residence and their pet's names,can I use it as a reference for both facts? If so, how do I do that? ◊™◊û◊ô ◊†◊ô◊†◊ô◊ï (talk) 14:44, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Yes. If you're using the source editor, write <ref name="foo">Citation details here</ref> the first time and then <ref name="foo"/> the second time. If you're using the visual editor, just click the reference, control-C, and then control-V wherever you want to reuse it. Mrfoogles (talk) 14:48, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

I don‚Äôt know any
it might need to (or specifically not?) be an admin related to a specific topic because it is about rules from the arbitration committee.
So I wanted to come here first to ask if and what‚Äôs the right place to ask a question like this. (About rules) AND if it turns out that this place (teahouse) is also the right place for this, I‚Äôd like to follow up with asking the actual question about rules here, linking to the conversation where my confusion lead to the question(s).
Thanks in advance. Slomo666 (talk) 15:38, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Yes, you may pose your questions here. 331dot (talk) 15:40, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
That‚Äôs great.
So basically my questions are roughly contained in this message on my talk page.
although even before I would ask those, I might already be helped greatly if someone could direct me to a very detailed explanation of how the rules from ARBPIA work. (If I can read that, maybe I can figure it out myself. The thing linked by the person I was talking to, did not really answer my questions)

ARBPIA rules + Extended confirmed, hope these links are of some help. Butterscotch Beluga (talk) 17:28, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Not really tbh. I‚Äôve read these already and they don‚Äôt reassure me if I am or am not allowed to edit on P/I issues/pages. The issue is mostly that another editor warned me this was not allowed because I don‚Äôt have 500 edits in the mainspace (see the link above, which is a comment replying to that editor) despite having been granted extended confirmed status.
The point that editor brought up was basically accusing me of ‚Äúgaming‚Äù because the plurality of my edits are on talk pages. Slomo666 (talk) 17:56, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Slomo666, the other editor's concerns seemed to be about you gaming the system, which is manipulating the rules to gain an advantage or an advanced permission. Despite a comment by that other editor on your user talk page, there is no requirement that the 500 edits for extended confirmed status be to article space. On the other hand, it is required that the edits be useful and productive, and not phony "make work" edits. While talk page edits can certainly be constructive, not every such edit actually is. On your talk page, you commented I have a lot of talk page edits because I tend to get into very long (sometimes pointless) conversations. In response to that, my two pieces of advice to you are to be succinct and to avoid pointless conversations. For example, asking a question about whether you are allowed to ask a question at the Teahouse is a bit bizarre. The ARBPIA topic area is one where tempers are often frayed and some editors may be looking for evidence of misconduct. Do not behave in a manner that is highly likely to irritate other editors. That never ends well in the ARBPIA world. Cullen328 (talk) 18:02, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
For what it's worth, I am an administrator as is 331dot. Asking a legitimate question is never "bothering" and we became administrators to help with such matters. On the other hand, it is not a good idea to develop a reputation of being a pest. Cullen328 (talk) 18:08, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Dear All,
I will be happy receiving your help for translate in English a page. It is about an artist (1932!) who spent in London many years. He made many exhibitions and I have some catalogues. Happy if someone would like to help. Cecio208 (talk) 16:05, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Where is the original page, and what language is it in?
What help do you need? Does WP:Translate answer your question? Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 16:29, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hello, @Cecio208, and welcome to the Teahouse.
If the original article has citations which are satisfactory and adequate for the criteria in English Wikipedia (see WP:42), then simply translating the article may be enough. But if the sources are not adequate (which is often the case for articles in other-language Wikipedia, since English Wikipedia's criteria are stricter than most), then translating the existing article is mostly a waste of time, and the only productive approach is to treat it as a new article in English, and start by finding suitable sources. See WP:YFA. ColinFine (talk) 20:04, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hi @Cecio208 and welcome to the Teahouse and to Wikipedia. Everything said up until now is correct, but I want emphasise that as always you will need to ensure that the English translation is written in proper English without mistakes. Mariamnei (talk) 06:05, 22 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Is this article paraphrased enough[edit]
Bhatikabhaya- I have brought info from several books and paraphrased much as I could, I hope someone can check it for me.Thanks TeenX808 (talk) 17:29, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hello, TeenX808. In order for a Teahouse host to check your paraphrasing, it would be necessary for them to have access to the three books that you cited. That seems unlikely. Cullen328 (talk) 18:14, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Cullen328: yes I can and the first book isn‚Äôt that important since it‚Äôs just the date
2nd book-https://www.noolaham.net/project/46/4516/4516.pdf
3rd book- http://noolaham.net/project/999/99863/99863.pdfTeenX808 (talk) 18:25, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
TeenX808, there is way more content about your topic in the second book that can be paraphrased and added. Personally, I would use a different word than "plastered" since it is imprecise and has multiple meanings in English. I am unfamiliar with the historicity of accounts of events in Sri Lanka 2000 years ago, but I would be cautious about describing things that may have legendary components as being true in Wikipedia's voice. Cullen328 (talk) 18:49, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Cullen328: I‚Äôm little too cautious due to the copy right violations and should I use the word applied TeenX808 (talk) 18:51, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
TeenX808, I think that "applied" is a good alternative. Others might be "coated" or "overlaid". Cullen328 (talk) 18:59, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Cullen328: went with coated and what do you think of the last part, thank you so much for the help.TeenX808 (talk) 19:03, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
TeenX808, the following sentence is confusing and so it needs to be rewritten. Also "Roman" is capitalized. A roman soldier had grounded on to the territory of Anuradhapura kingdom and with him he had taken a Anuradhapura citizen, it is said that he had become a diplomat for the Roman Empire. Cullen328 (talk) 21:45, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Cullen328: how do you think the sentence should be rewritten without causing issues. ThanksTeenX808 (talk) 08:38, 22 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
TeenX808, I cannot help you much with that because I am unfamiliar with the material. Did the Roman Empire actually have diplomats posted that far away? What does grounded on to the territory mean? I do not understand the phrase. Also, with him he had taken a Anuradhapura citizen is also unclear to me. Does "taken" indicate that it was forceful? What is the significance? Did anything become of this diplomatic connection? Was citizenship even a "thing" back then? Weren't most people usually considered subjects of a ruler? Cullen328 (talk) 09:00, 22 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Cullen328: ‚ÄúAt the beginning of the Christian era, during the reign of Bhatik√£bhaya, a Roman sailor named Annius Plocamus inadvertently landed on the island and spent some time in Sri Lanka. It is not clear how this man reached the island. He must have arrived via India. When he returned to Rome he took a representative back with him to the court of the Emperor Augustus.This representative was, apparently, given ambassadorial status‚Äù.
this is the original text, I had to paraphrase not to commit copy right. TeenX808 (talk) 13:47, 22 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Frankly, TeenX808, I think that you can do a much better job of paraphrasing that content. Perhaps reading the article Annius Plocamus, which contains seven references, would be helpful. You can move content from that article to your draft as long as you attribute it.
Cullen328 (talk) 16:37, 22 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Also worth noting is that the source you quoted does not mention citizenship. How did you come up with that? Also, it was not Annius Plocamus himself who ended up in Sri Lanka, but a "freedman" working for him. Cullen328 (talk) 17:11, 22 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Cullen328: source says it him and what you said is smart let me read the sources from that article. Thanks TeenX808 (talk) 17:21, 22 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
TeenX808, even a generally reliable source can be wrong about one thing. Now that you have several sources available to compare, you should be better able to summarize this incident, and especially its significance. Cullen328 (talk) 17:30, 22 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Need Help With New Article Draft: Parcel Perform[edit]
Hi Editors,
I've created a new article for Parcel Perform (Draft:Parcel Perform) because there is limited information available online covering who the organisation is and what they do. Can anyone take a look at the refined draft that I submitted recently and see if it's normal and neutral enough for the submission to get approved?
Alternatively, if I could get some feedback on how to refine this, then I'll gladly take it as well. Thank you!
Mikethepageeditor (talk) 02:51, 22 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hello, Mikethepageeditor. When you write because there is limited information available online covering who the organisation is and what they do, that is an argument against a Wikipedia article about this company. Lots of information from reliable sources entirely independent of the company is required to write the article and your job would then be to neutrally summarize what those sources say about the company. Routine coverage of funding rounds does not help. Interviews with company executives do not help. Nothing generated by press releases or public relatikns efforts helps. Please read Wikipedia:Notability (organizations and companies) to better understand the strict standards. Cullen328 (talk) 05:57, 22 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Social media not being a reliable source[edit]
Hello to all, would you please explain on why is social media not a very reliable source to begin with? Also, are RSS feeds allowed to be cited as a source? What happens if you add social media links to an article? 107.116.89.118 (talk) 11:01, 22 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The main problem is that self-published sources are difficult to verfify, since people can write what they like. There are some cases where that would be OK but they are rare: see the perennial source list for individual sources like Twitter/X and Linkedin. Note that external links to a person's social media in a biography are acceptable. Mike Turnbull (talk) 11:13, 22 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Sections on mobile[edit]
The sections on the page AlphaGo versus Lee Sedol don't work properly on mobile (they are automatically collapsed); what is the issue that is causing this? Stockhausenfan (talk) 11:20, 22 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hi, welcome to the Teahouse!
I believe on mobile Wikipedia sections are collapsed by default. You can change this in the settings menu on the mobile website. SnowyRiver28 (talk) 12:11, 22 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hi, thanks for responding! What I meant was what I think is a specific issue with this page not with the mobile Wikipedia as a whole. For example today's featured article Thomas J. Hudner Jr. works as expected; for me the sections are uncollapsed and I can collapse or uncollapse them by pressing on the section heading, and this is the same for most Wikipedia pages. However that specific one I mentioned above (AlphaGo versus Lee Sedol) is not only collapsed by default, but it is not possible to uncollapse the sections. I think this is an issue with the formatting of that page, although my attempt to fix it through editing didn't work. Stockhausenfan (talk) 12:27, 22 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hmm ok. I've had a look on my phone on both the website and app and I can't see any issues. I assume you're on the mobile website from your edit tags. The article is all mainly one big section which is expanded for me when I open the page. Sorry I've not been of much help! SnowyRiver28 (talk) 12:52, 22 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Operation Clog the Toilet[edit]
There has been a lot of news lately, especially in the India press, about "Operation Clog the Toilet" started by the 4chan community. This was a coordinated online campaign to block flight bookings for Indian H-1B visa holders returning to the United States, in wake of the Trump administration announcement of imposing a $100,000 annual fee for H-1B visas entering the country by a deadline (amended to "new H-1Bs only", and also amended to "not annually" after the 4chan operation began).
By virtue of the sources I found, I thought it may be worth writing a draft about it, but looking at WP:NEVENT I'm not so sure, especially since the corrections by the Trump administration kind of nullified it, so it doesn't have lasting impact, which is a requirement for an event to be notable. What do the regulars think? ~Anachronist (talk) 16:28, 22 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
It probably warrants a sentence or two in whichever article covers the H-1B furore. It more material emerges over time, a section can be created, and then spun out into a full article, later. Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 19:57, 22 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Help with sectioning[edit]
Hello everyone. I recently created Rajballabh Sen, an article about an 18th-century Bengali revenue administrator and diwan. The article currently has no sections. The reason for this is that I initially thought the article would possibly be, at best, a Stub-class (or maybe just a little longer) article, and therefore wouldn't be long enough to warrant any sections. However, now that it's been created and published, it's easy to conclude that I had misjudged the article. It does need to be split into sections. But the way the article is structured, I believe the typical "Early life; Career; etc" format wouldn't be possible. Can anyone help me split up the article into sections? Any help would be really appreciated! Thanks, Dissoxciate (talk) 17:22, 22 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Catalogues[edit]

Hello.
For what reason do you want to cite a catalog as a source?
Leaving aside copyright issues, you don't need to upload an actual copy of it, just write out a citation(the publication, publication date, page numbers, etc.). See referencing for beginners. 331dot (talk) 19:51, 22 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
You can only upload them if they are copyright expired or freely licensed; you can cite them as sources most things, if they are published by reputable institutions.
We'd need to know more about what they are and what you want to use them to cite, to be definitive, but see WP:Reliable sources and WP:Independent sources for more. Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 19:53, 22 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Many large museums and large art museums heavily invest in large exhibitions. A high percentage of these are accompanied by large books, aiming to depict and say something perceptive about each exhibit, perhaps strictly exhibit by exhibit, perhaps not. These heavyweight successors to the catalogues [in a more normal sense of the word] of a few decades ago are still often called catalogues. Uh ..... I was about to refer you, Cecio208, to the article Exhibition catalogue, but it's a mess. And its history shows that I'm partly to blame. (Well, that was mostly back in 2007, a simpler time.) Anyway, today's exhibition catalogues can normally be treated in the same way as books that haven't accompanied exhibitions. -- Hoary (talk) 23:59, 22 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
My Guide to Article Writing[edit]
This attempt at humour is only slightly serious.
To write a great Wikipedia article about yourself or your company, it's important to understand your audience: the general public. Think how little they know about you, and how difficult it has been (until now) for them to find out more. To understand them better, try the following exercise:
Imagine your own (or your company's own) biggest fan, who doesn't know you (or know anyone who works for your company). Imagine what they know about you already, just from being your biggest fan, finding out everything they can without getting to know anyone. Write down what a person like that has been able to find out about you so far.
... And you're done! You've now composed your entire Wikipedia article! Footnote the references and submit it. TooManyFingers (talk) 22:06, 22 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
What's the best way for a new user to fight against vandalism?[edit]
Curious Crystalite13 (talk) 23:57, 22 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
By first waiting till you've made a couple of hundred non-trivial edits to articles, and have experienced disagreements with other editors of those articles, and thereby familiarized yourself with such matters as where unhelpful but good-natured editing ends and vandalism begins. You'll then be a lot better equipped to diagnose and deal with vandalism than you probably are now. -- Hoary (talk) 00:05, 23 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

What is a "title blacklist"?[edit]
I saw on this page (Talk:Https://www.c-span.org/presidentsurvey2021/?page=overall) that this article is "on the title blacklist". What exactly is a title blacklist? RetinaSW (talk) 00:25, 23 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The title blacklist is a list of patterns that, if a new page would match one of those patterns, prevents its creation. jlwoodwa (talk) 00:31, 23 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Ok. Thank you! RetinaSW (talk) 00:32, 23 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
