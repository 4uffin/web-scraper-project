IP Peer Review.[edit]
Peer Review Guidelines is not clear on whether IP editors can nominate for PR. Though I won't remember to do it by the time I get home. I know intellectually that its unlikely due to IP editors not being able to create pages however.
I'm going to be checking every few hours while I am at this district.
Specifically looking to ask for a review of Plurality (identity) 24.155.147.109 (talk) 14:17, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I see nothing to prevent an IP address from requesting a peer review. The only thing that would stop you is a semi-protected talk page. Otherwise, just follow the instructions. ~Anachronist (talk) 14:48, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Yep, can't create the PR page
You do not have permission to edit this page, for the following reason:
Wikipedia does not have a project page with this exact name.
You need to log in or create an account to create this page.
Search for "Peer review/Plurality (identity)/archive1" in existing pages within the Wikipedia namespace.
Look for pages within Wikipedia that link to this title.

OK. I don't understand why you can't log into one account from school, and log into another account from home. ~Anachronist (talk) 21:13, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
because I can't log in within Georgetown Independent School District at all. The district decided to remove access to central auth early last school year. The only possible way for me to log in is if an WP:ADMIN moved User:IPOfAFlower to a local (enwiki) account. 24.155.147.109 (talk) 13:36, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

yes. They are generally very stubborn about re-enabling things for some reason. Flower (she/her; User talk:IPOfAFlower) 22:57, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

why allow paid editing?[edit]
hello! I have a question. why is it that wikipedia permits paid editing to occur at all? right now, paid editors have to declare their COI, which is nice, but to me at least it would make more sense to ban paid editing entirely. given all of the scams, and wasted time, and useless questions, and disruptive editors, I think it would be better to make paid editing and COI editing against wikipedia policy. after all, wikimedia doesn't get compensated for paid editing work or anything. of course, I'm not demanding this decades-old policy be changed immediately. I'm just genuinely curious. that's all. thanks! 67.218.119.178 (talk) 22:12, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The consensus of the Wikipedia community has been that if we were to ban paid editing, the paid editors would probably still edit here but would not admit it and thus be more difficult to regulate. MrOllie (talk) 22:20, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
We highly discourage paid editors from editing articles directly. Some of them have useful suggestions, and as for the rest: I expect that people are more likely to comply with disclosure and editing requirements than to respect a strict ban. And given that our scam warning hasn't kept scammers from promising they can publish and protect articles (or alternatively threaten to delete them, as blackmail), I doubt announcing a strict ban would affect them much either. jlwoodwa (talk) 22:24, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I hadn't known that we have paid editors. If they are discouraged from editing articles directly, then what do they edit? I'm just curious; I have no interest in being one. Maurice Magnus (talk) 22:57, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
For existing articles, they can edit talk pages and make edit requests; for new articles, they can create them in draftspace and submit them to Articles for creation. jlwoodwa (talk) 23:00, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
They can also, for example, edit directly if they are reverting egregious vandalism; making uncontroversial factual updates or technical fixes; or adding uncontroversial and non-promotional citations; all providing that appropriate declarations are made. They can also make edits suggested via the edit request process, if they are invited to so so by an independent editor. And see WP:CURATOR. Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 16:42, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Maurice Magnus, "assistance with writing a wikipedia page" (above) may interest you. -- Hoary (talk) 07:52, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Not all paid editors are ill-intentioned scammers! For example, it's quite likely that when there's a staff reshuffle at a university, and there's a new vice-chancellor, it will be some random member of faculty, grad student or post-doc who first notices that Wikipedia hasn't caught up. They aren't necessarily employed by the university's comms department, but because they're employed by the university, they're paid editors. They are, however, quite useful. Elemimele (talk) 12:55, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Some paid editors are very helpful in keeping articles up-to-date. Some I interact with provide relevant photographs and suggest new sources that can be used: all via article talk pages, as required by the COI provisions. Mike Turnbull (talk) 13:19, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
If you look carefully at the wording of the paid editing policy, you'll see that's wrong. Just being an employee who updates an employer's article doesn't make you a paid editor. Publicity efforts need to be part of your job description. I disagree with this, personally. I think an employee who makes promotional edits about their employer should be considered a paid editor regardless of whether PR is part of their job. ~Anachronist (talk) 14:44, 23 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
You have it exactly the wrong way round.
"promotional edits" are "publicity efforts", by definition, and are treated as such both by our policy and our practical responses to such edits. Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 16:41, 23 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Users who are compensated for¬†any¬†publicity efforts related to the subject of their Wikipedia contributions are deemed to be paid editors. If someone's role at a company is completely unrelated to publicity, they are not (by a strict reading of WP:PAID) a paid editor. Many editors disagree or use a different definition in practice; that is exactly Anachronist's point. jlwoodwa (talk) 16:53, 23 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
There's an ongoing discussion about this on Wikipedia talk:Paid-contribution disclosure in which I suggested an expansion to the current definition in the policy to include any person making promotional edits in behalf of the entity paying them, regardless of whether promotion/publicity is part of their actual job. I proposed that because that's the consensus I see on individual user talk pages as well as this discussion right here above. ~Anachronist (talk) 17:03, 23 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Citations look weird. Help?[edit]
Can someone verify these articles look okay to you? I enjoy contributing to Wiki and these citations look weird to me even though they check out on crossref for me.
https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1284381/[https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC945](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9458805/)
In case you‚Äôre interested in my discussion about the difference between assistive devices and Psychotherapy you can find what I‚Äôve written so far here: User talk:Bogwife. 2600:8802:5517:C300:1C43:C86B:BA9E:FC2A (talk) 21:33, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Whether "these articles look okay" to us in which sense? Whichever Wikipedia article each of these is or might be used on, the Wikipedia article has a talk page; and it's on that talk page that you can ask about the looking-okay-ness of this or that potential source. Though you should be a lot clearer than "[looking] okay to you". Also, be sure to be logged in as Bogwife when you ask, and indeed when you edit in general. -- Hoary (talk) 22:33, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Certificates look fine. But there‚Äôs no WHOIS page for the URLs. Seems like potentially AI-generated and malicious but very subtle? Bogwife (talk) 00:04, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Bogwife Your Talk page starts with "thank you!".
It's not clear who you are thanking.
And it says "I agree with you" and I agree" in a couple of other places.
Who is "you"? David10244 (talk) 22:52, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The first journal looks okay, nothing initially comes up when I look for people discussing it being predatory. In general, I would do that journals as many of them have not been discussed at WP:RSN or WP:RSP. Also, be heavily mindful of WP:MEDRS and note that my strategy is likely not foolproof. ‚ú∂Quxyz‚ú∂ (talk) 22:50, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Also, do note that because of how you formatted the link, the articles are rather awkward to access. ‚ú∂Quxyz‚ú∂ (talk) 22:52, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
A single 2013 study on three children doi:10.1901/jaba.2002.35-213, which is the first link above, will not pass our WP:MEDRS requirement for sources. Mike Turnbull (talk) 11:19, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
That's pretty much why I only analyzed the journal's credentials as to if it was predatory or not; I do not want to finick with MEDRS as I am relatively unqualified in analyzing a source to that level as my fields (history and earth sciences) do not require such depth. ‚ú∂Quxyz‚ú∂ (talk) 13:37, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
When you call it "your discussion", for me that causes a sort of alarm bell. For Wikipedia, it needs to be someone else's discussion. All you can be in the article is a reporter - not a discusser. TooManyFingers (talk) 06:02, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I'm not sure I understand what you're asking.

Pending article.[edit]
Hello, I am reaching out regarding the feedback I received for article https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Draft:Amnis
I have made the necessary changes (company name capitalization, adding more external sources and deleted one section to better match the encyclopedic format). Before re-submitting, could I receive a little bit more in-depth feedback in case the current version still needs some tweaks?
Best,
~~~~ Stefan85xx (talk) 07:03, 20 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hello, @Stefan85xx. That is the purpose of review. We don't normally do pre-reviews. ColinFine (talk) 10:43, 20 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I see ColinFine's comment that we don't normally do pre-reviews, but I just had a look, and to me the whole article still looks very much like advertising. The problem (as I see it) is not style, but content. The whole article is set up to show what this company can offer me if I do business with them, and how I can become their customer ‚Äì most or all of that needs to be deleted. A Wikipedia article shows mainly (taking almost all of the words in the article) how the company has been seen in the past by the general public who are not doing business with them. We want to merely collect and show the information that any member of the general public could already find in the public library and the news. We don't want any information that wasn't already communicated to the public by reliable sources unrelated to the company (or only a little of that). TooManyFingers (talk) 16:56, 20 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Most of it's not encyclopaedic. If I revised it, I'd trim at least half. Tell me why someone in another country (eg. Uruguay or Fiji) would want to know about this company? Why is the company special? MmeMaigret (talk) 10:42, 22 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
More specifically, to tell you what reliable publications unrelated to the company have already said about those things. TooManyFingers (talk) 15:18, 22 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Draft Article Declined[edit]
Hi! I've recently been working on my first article and am having trouble getting it accepted. The article is about a film writer, director, and producer who is highly cited across the internet and in entertainment media news and is the winner of several industry awards, yet doesn't seem to have a page. (The name of this filmmaker is Ari Katcher.) He's show running the new adaptation of Jennette McCurdy's memoir I'm Glad My Mom Died for Apple TV+ starring Jennifer Aniston, so I believe he will continue to pick up notoriety as the series progresses and it would be great to start a Wikipedia profile. My draft article has been declined twice now for the same reasoning of "notability / not enough reliable, independent secondary sources cited."
The first time I submitted, the majority of my citations about his work credits were pulled from IMDb, which I understand is an editable cite, so maybe not recognized as an independent source. However, in preparation for my resubmission, I added several articles from various reputable entertainment news outlets, including Deadline, Hollywood Reporter, Variety, and Vanity Fair, as well as the official sites of the organizations that granted Ari his several industry awards. My resubmission was still declined for the same reasoning though. I'm wondering if anyone could take a look at the page and let me know if there is something different I should be including to help this page be accepted? Here is the link to the draft article: Draft:Ari Katcher Xor19nemr16 (talk) 15:58, 20 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Please read WP:RS to see what is meant by reliable sources. TooManyFingers (talk) 16:03, 20 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Some feedback for you:
Delete all of the IMDB citations
Only the O'Falt source discusses him in any significant manner. The others only mention him in passing. Suggest you find at least one more source that discusses him for about 250 or more words.
Btw: all you've really got so far is the lead of the article. That could be enough for a stub but you should really be aiming to write sections Early life and education, Career, Awards and Recognition. A Personal Life section isn't obligatory but you'll probably find information as you do more research.
- MmeMaigret (talk) 11:06, 22 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Thank you for this feedback - very helpful!

Birth date sourcing[edit]
On the page for Carlos Fernandes (activist) I want to include the Facebook funeral announcement from the NGO he was a founder of, Iris Angola, as a source his date of birth.
For context, other news outlets do not provide his birth date. Some say he was 41, but according the funeral announcement from Iris Angola, he was 40 at the time of his passing. Considering this is the only source that gives a date of birth at all, and considering it would be odd for the organization he founded to get his birthday wrong, I think it should be used for date of birth.
However, it is a self-published source (a Facebook post) which typically isn't allowed. I verified the Facebook account is legitimate and does belong to the real Iris Angola since another news source, the Bay Area Reporter, linked to it saying it was Iris.
Is this use of a self published source allowed given the circumstances? Thanks.¬†Urchincrawler (talk) 01:25, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
That seems reasonable. Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 10:45, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I think one main reason this should be good is that there's no sign of possible controversy about this particular person's birth date. If controversy was expected, it might be different. TooManyFingers (talk) 13:20, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
You can include it on the basis that that's where you got the information. It's just won't count as a reliable secondary source. You can also add the date with an "independent citation needed" template after it, or add the date and the fb source with an "independent citation needed" template after it. MmeMaigret (talk) 03:10, 23 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Seems A-OK. I did a similar thing with a date for a specific festival. If you're worried about it, perhaps include a <!---hidden message---/!> explaining why you think the source is good enough to prevent other editors from fiddling with it. (Unless they found a better source, of course.) Commandant Quacks-a-lot (talk) 00:04, 24 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Struggling to get an article accepted[edit]
Hi, can someone please give me some support to finalise a submission Draft:Annah Stretton 2
Mesomay (talk) 02:04, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
What have they been saying is wrong with it? TooManyFingers (talk) 02:10, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Thanks for the quick reply...This submission's references do not show that the subject qualifies for a Wikipedia article‚Äîthat is, they do not show significant coverage (not just passing mentions) about the subject in published, reliable, secondary sources that are independent of the subject (see the guidelines on the notability of people). Before any resubmission, additional references meeting these criteria should be added (see technical help and learn about mistakes to avoid when addressing this issue). If no additional references exist, the subject is not suitable for Wikipedia. Mesomay (talk) 02:15, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I see. Unfortunately, the only way to fix this problem is to find those references they talked about. It means that so far, the article's references are the wrong kind. Does that make sense? TooManyFingers (talk) 02:52, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Everybody knows that Wikipedia must have an article about Einstein, one of the most important figures in 20th-century science.
Everybody knows that Wikipedia must NOT have an article about me, because I am not important to the rest of the world, only to me and a few people who know me.
Almost every person is in between: they are more notable than me, but less notable than Einstein. To have an article about them, we have to prove they are notable. (It's easy to prove Einstein is notable, and impossible to prove I am notable.) TooManyFingers (talk) 03:01, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Thank you so much for your response. I think I understand what you are saying. My subject is definitely notable in New Zealand, which is evidenced by the number of awards she has won in business and fashion. I can find examples of other New Zealanders with less notoriety and they have used media sources aswell. Are you able to access the draft? Mesomay (talk) 04:57, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Awards don't help unless the awards themselves are notable awards. (On a different topic, think of those "car of the year" awards that the carmakers always give to each other and that nobody follows.) Published material (independent sources choosing to write articles about her work without interviewing her, for example) is worth a lot more. Have you carefully read the requirements listed in the message you got? Those requirements are tailored to your particular situation - it's not just a form letter that everyone gets. TooManyFingers (talk) 12:10, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

This is about Draft:Annah Stretton 2 (started by Mesomay); not to be confused with Draft:Annah Stretton (about the same person, and started by RKLET). "Media source" is a term that covers anything from scrupulously compiled material read for enlightenment and/or pleasure (and for which one would willingly pay money) all the way down to uncritically recycled PR bumf. There is no simple relationship between (A) degree of fame (or "notoriety") and (B) notability (as understood here). -- Hoary (talk) 07:38, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
In order to establish notability, you've got to satisfy one of the categories of presumed notability or show significant coverage in multiple reliable sources. Your article needs restructuring and doesn't do a good job of highlighting her notability. You've also got so many sources that, in some ways, they hide the better sources. I've revised the article and beefed up the lead, which now highlights her order of merit (see WP:ANYBIO) in the lead. It would help if some of the articles about her, that likely show sig cov (eg. the NZ Herald articles) weren't behind paywalls. You might see if you can find free sources so people can see that they actually show sig cov. MmeMaigret (talk) 04:06, 23 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Hello Andy.
Rovos Rail is a 'pocket of excellence' when it comes to South African tourism ‚Äì widly regarded as one of the best luxury train experiences globally. However I notice that Rovos Rail focuses on a derailment ‚Äì to some extent overshadowing Rovos‚Äô success and benefits that it brings to regional tourism- in a remarkably challenging Southern African rail environment.
Ceres Rail Company focuses on the restoration of both freight and tourist rail services within the Western Cape province of South Africa to; (1) reduce traffic congestion in Cape Town, caused in part by booming regional tourism and property sectors, and;(2) promote tourism in outlying rural regions of the Western Cape, notably Elgin, South Africa
and Ceres, South Africa, in addition to occasionally Darling, Simon's Town and overnight trips to Mossell Bay. Recently Ceres Rail Company has added Botrivier as a destination which will enhance the tourism appeal of another rural town.
Ceres Rail Company retains skills from former Transnet (State Logics Company) employees to maintain and restore heritage locomotives, such as South African Class 26 4-8-4 and rollingstock including the Union Limited, formerly Blue Train (South Africa) and more recently the restoration of rail infostructure. CRC‚Äôs other primary focus is enabling the migration of road freight to rail from Ceres, the leading fruit growing region of South Africa, to the Port of Cape Town. Unfortunately the Michell's Pass branch line was severely damaged during floods in June 2023. CRC is now endeavoring to restorage the railway through the pass at its own cost in order to restore the freight and tourism rail services between Cape Town and Ceres.
The restoration of freight rail services provides significant benefits to the region, including reduced damage to provincial roads, reduced logistics costs for exports, reduced truck induced road accidents and reduced congestion in the City of Cape Town. In the context of the incident you mention, as you have pointed out, the experienced locomotive crew was able to brake hard to avoid the train heading into parked rail wagons, which unfortunately caused some passengers to be thrown forward. Fortunately, the incident was not severe to an extent that it required the involvement of the company‚Äôs Public Liability Insurance provider. However in an ideal world the incident mentioned shouldn‚Äôt overshadow the mission of restoring rail operations in the Western Cape.
The reasons why I‚Äôm looking into Wikipedia in the context of Ceres Rail Company are¬†;(1) numerous Wikipedia search results make references to Ceres Rail Company, without it obviously having a Wikipedia page and (2) AI generated search results contain a surprising amount of misinformation or Hallucination (artificial intelligence) I figured that a dedicated Wikipedia page could help remedy the above.
Apologies for not being able to keep my response to a few lines.
Kind Regards

Please read WP:SCAM as a matter of priority. Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 08:11, 22 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I agree about reading WP:SCAM, first.
I want to add that hiring a content creator for a Wikipedia article is very much like hiring a "money creator" at the very moment you need to buy something. Buying something requires you to have the money already, and no matter how qualified an expert is, they can't create money.
In the same way, the content of a Wikipedia article is strictly limited to the content that already existed before you start, and no expert is able to just create some for you.
(In fact getting an article on Wikipedia is even more strict than needing money before you buy something, because Wikipedia can't defer its requirements about legitimate content that already existed. No credit card exists for this.) TooManyFingers (talk) 19:22, 22 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The point is Simon Le May Beckett, that appeals to other editors to write an article for you (for whatever reason) don't often work, because everybody here is a volunteer that chooses what they spend their time on. If you are lucky enough to catch somebody's interest, so they want to work on it: great; but that doesn't often happen.
So most of the time, if you want an article writing, the most likely way to make that happen is to do it yourself. The articles for creation process is designed for (among other things) people with a COI to create articles even with their COI.
Having said that, creating an article is the most difficult and challenging task for new editors. My earnest advice to new editors is to not even think about
trying to create an article until you have spent several weeks - at least - learning about how Wikipedia works by making improvements to existing articles. Once you have understood core policies such as verifiability, neutral point of view, reliable, independent sources, and notability, and experienced how we handle disagreements with other editors (the Bold, Revert, Discuss cycle), then you might be ready to read your first article carefully, and try creating a draft. If you don't follow this advice but try to create an article without this preparation, you are likely to have a frustrating and disappointing experience with Wikipedia. And that's even without a COI.
It's possible that you will find somebody interested in working with you on this at WikiProject Trains; but don't hold your breath. --ColinFine (talk) 19:18, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Wikipedia has no barrier to entry but it does have rules/ways of operating and as you can see you‚Äôve already run foul of a number of them. Suggest you create the draft page as suggested. You can also add the page to a WikiProject for South Africa? (not South Australia, right?) and hope someone writes it. Or you can write the page yourself and declare your conflict on the talk page. But note the company needs to be notable to warrant a page, see WP: company. This is an encyclopaedia - if the company wouldn‚Äôt make it into an encyclopaedia for ZA, it won‚Äôt make it into a global encyclopaedia. Also suggest you use another quality company article as a guide. You might also get someone else at your company to write the page. You never know, you might already have an existing WP editor. But avoid choosing Comms. Comms/PR writing is not WP writing and, like your explanation above, it shows. ps People are more likely to have a look when you have something to review.MmeMaigret (talk) 06:36, 23 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Reusing citations[edit]
If a citation/reference I used supports more than one fact in an entry, e.g., it states both a person's place of residence and their pet's names,can I use it as a reference for both facts? If so, how do I do that? ◊™◊û◊ô ◊†◊ô◊†◊ô◊ï (talk) 14:44, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Yes. If you're using the source editor, write <ref name="foo">Citation details here</ref> the first time and then <ref name="foo"/> the second time. If you're using the visual editor, just click the reference, control-C, and then control-V wherever you want to reuse it. Mrfoogles (talk) 14:48, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Everything said here is correct, but I will advise that you should ensure that you never reuse the same name for two distinct references in the same article, which will create a template error. It happens two often that there will be a <ref name="NYTimes"> and then the next New York Times article will inadvertently receive the same name.

Question(s) about rules[edit]
Hey there, I have a question and I really hope I‚Äôm in the right place here to ask. (All the different places appear to suggest I should go to a place)
My question is a bit double. I want to know if there is a place on Wikipedia where I can find someone to answer a question about the rules/policies of Wikipedia, because I am not sure if what I am doing is allowed or not.
Someone suggested I ask an Admin, but
I don‚Äôt want to bother them.
I don‚Äôt know any
it might need to (or specifically not?) be an admin related to a specific topic because it is about rules from the arbitration committee.
So I wanted to come here first to ask if and what‚Äôs the right place to ask a question like this. (About rules) AND if it turns out that this place (teahouse) is also the right place for this, I‚Äôd like to follow up with asking the actual question about rules here, linking to the conversation where my confusion lead to the question(s).
Thanks in advance. Slomo666 (talk) 15:38, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Yes, you may pose your questions here. 331dot (talk) 15:40, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
That‚Äôs great.
So basically my questions are roughly contained in this message on my talk page.
although even before I would ask those, I might already be helped greatly if someone could direct me to a very detailed explanation of how the rules from ARBPIA work. (If I can read that, maybe I can figure it out myself. The thing linked by the person I was talking to, did not really answer my questions)

ARBPIA rules + Extended confirmed, hope these links are of some help. Butterscotch Beluga (talk) 17:28, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Not really tbh. I‚Äôve read these already and they don‚Äôt reassure me if I am or am not allowed to edit on P/I issues/pages. The issue is mostly that another editor warned me this was not allowed because I don‚Äôt have 500 edits in the mainspace (see the link above, which is a comment replying to that editor) despite having been granted extended confirmed status.
The point that editor brought up was basically accusing me of ‚Äúgaming‚Äù because the plurality of my edits are on talk pages. Slomo666 (talk) 17:56, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Slomo666, the other editor's concerns seemed to be about you gaming the system, which is manipulating the rules to gain an advantage or an advanced permission. Despite a comment by that other editor on your user talk page, there is no requirement that the 500 edits for extended confirmed status be to article space. On the other hand, it is required that the edits be useful and productive, and not phony "make work" edits. While talk page edits can certainly be constructive, not every such edit actually is. On your talk page, you commented I have a lot of talk page edits because I tend to get into very long (sometimes pointless) conversations. In response to that, my two pieces of advice to you are to be succinct and to avoid pointless conversations. For example, asking a question about whether you are allowed to ask a question at the Teahouse is a bit bizarre. The ARBPIA topic area is one where tempers are often frayed and some editors may be looking for evidence of misconduct. Do not behave in a manner that is highly likely to irritate other editors. That never ends well in the ARBPIA world. Cullen328 (talk) 18:02, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
For what it's worth, I am an administrator as is 331dot. Asking a legitimate question is never "bothering" and we became administrators to help with such matters. On the other hand, it is not a good idea to develop a reputation of being a pest. Cullen328 (talk) 18:08, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Hello, @Cecio208, and welcome to the Teahouse.
If the original article has citations which are satisfactory and adequate for the criteria in English Wikipedia (see WP:42), then simply translating the article may be enough. But if the sources are not adequate (which is often the case for articles in other-language Wikipedia, since English Wikipedia's criteria are stricter than most), then translating the existing article is mostly a waste of time, and the only productive approach is to treat it as a new article in English, and start by finding suitable sources. See WP:YFA. ColinFine (talk) 20:04, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hi @Cecio208 and welcome to the Teahouse and to Wikipedia. Everything said up until now is correct, but I want emphasise that as always you will need to ensure that the English translation is written in proper English without mistakes. Mariamnei (talk) 06:05, 22 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Social media not being a reliable source[edit]
Hello to all, would you please explain on why is social media not a very reliable source to begin with? Also, are RSS feeds allowed to be cited as a source? What happens if you add social media links to an article? 107.116.89.118 (talk) 11:01, 22 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The main problem is that self-published sources are difficult to verfify, since people can write what they like. There are some cases where that would be OK but they are rare: see the perennial source list for individual sources like Twitter/X and Linkedin. Note that external links to a person's social media in a biography are acceptable. Mike Turnbull (talk) 11:13, 22 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Hi, welcome to the Teahouse!
I believe on mobile Wikipedia sections are collapsed by default. You can change this in the settings menu on the mobile website. SnowyRiver28 (talk) 12:11, 22 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hi, thanks for responding! What I meant was what I think is a specific issue with this page not with the mobile Wikipedia as a whole. For example today's featured article Thomas J. Hudner Jr. works as expected; for me the sections are uncollapsed and I can collapse or uncollapse them by pressing on the section heading, and this is the same for most Wikipedia pages. However that specific one I mentioned above (AlphaGo versus Lee Sedol) is not only collapsed by default, but it is not possible to uncollapse the sections. I think this is an issue with the formatting of that page, although my attempt to fix it through editing didn't work. Stockhausenfan (talk) 12:27, 22 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hmm ok. I've had a look on my phone on both the website and app and I can't see any issues. I assume you're on the mobile website from your edit tags.

Hi, this is my draft, it's under review: Draft:Joe Polish Do you know if my sources comply with Wikipedia's criteria? And are they enough? On my latest review, they said the article was weakly sourced. Luichi luichi (talk) 12:43, 22 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Luichi luichi Hello. I fixed your link, it doesn't need the url. You are essentially asking for us to review your draft before it is reviewed; please let the process play out. The reviewer will leave feedback if they don't accept the draft. 331dot (talk) 12:46, 22 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
If you've taken the last reviewer's advice literally and in detail, the chances go up. The reviewers tell you straight out, which parts of Wikipedia's criteria are the ones that need your attention. Don't try to go by other more general criteria instead, because you'll lose focus on what needs doing. TooManyFingers (talk) 14:39, 22 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Operation Clog the Toilet[edit]
There has been a lot of news lately, especially in the India press, about "Operation Clog the Toilet" started by the 4chan community. This was a coordinated online campaign to block flight bookings for Indian H-1B visa holders returning to the United States, in wake of the Trump administration announcement of imposing a $100,000 annual fee for H-1B visas entering the country by a deadline (amended to "new H-1Bs only", and also amended to "not annually" after the 4chan operation began).
By virtue of the sources I found, I thought it may be worth writing a draft about it, but looking at WP:NEVENT I'm not so sure, especially since the corrections by the Trump administration kind of nullified it, so it doesn't have lasting impact, which is a requirement for an event to be notable. What do the regulars think? ~Anachronist (talk) 16:28, 22 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
It probably warrants a sentence or two in whichever article covers the H-1B furore. It more material emerges over time, a section can be created, and then spun out into a full article, later. Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 19:57, 22 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Catalogues[edit]
are catalogues of former exhibition allow in wikipedia for upload? can thay be used as a source? how to use them in case? I have the pdf scan of them Cecio208 (talk) 19:44, 22 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hello.
For what reason do you want to cite a catalog as a source?
Leaving aside copyright issues, you don't need to upload an actual copy of it, just write out a citation(the publication, publication date, page numbers, etc.). See referencing for beginners. 331dot (talk) 19:51, 22 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
You can only upload them if they are copyright expired or freely licensed; you can cite them as sources most things, if they are published by reputable institutions.
We'd need to know more about what they are and what you want to use them to cite, to be definitive, but see WP:Reliable sources and WP:Independent sources for more. Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 19:53, 22 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Many large museums and large art museums heavily invest in large exhibitions. A high percentage of these are accompanied by large books, aiming to depict and say something perceptive about each exhibit, perhaps strictly exhibit by exhibit, perhaps not. These heavyweight successors to the catalogues [in a more normal sense of the word] of a few decades ago are still often called catalogues. Uh ..... I was about to refer you, Cecio208, to the article Exhibition catalogue, but it's a mess. And its history shows that I'm partly to blame. (Well, that was mostly back in 2007, a simpler time.) Anyway, today's exhibition catalogues can normally be treated in the same way as books that haven't accompanied exhibitions. -- Hoary (talk) 23:59, 22 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
thanks a lot for the explanation. I thought there could be a problem with the copyright... at the same time, catalogues are sometime the primary source of information. I will see if quoting part of the text as "book" is acceptable. Cecio208 (talk) 15:10, 24 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Fighting vandalism[edit]
What's the best way for a new user to fight against vandalism?
Curious Crystalite13 (talk) 23:57, 22 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
By first waiting till you've made a couple of hundred non-trivial edits to articles, and have experienced disagreements with other editors of those articles, and thereby familiarized yourself with such matters as where unhelpful but good-natured editing ends and vandalism begins. You'll then be a lot better equipped to diagnose and deal with vandalism than you probably are now. -- Hoary (talk) 00:05, 23 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
ok, thanks Crystalite13 (talk) 00:09, 23 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Crystalite13, I should have added: "... and you'll have made valuable contributions to existing articles". There's plenty to be done, and on nontrivial subjects too. Consider the two nations named Congo. They're so close that the capital of the one is just across the river from the capital of the other. But now see the article Democratic Republic of the Congo‚ÄìRepublic of the Congo relations. This currently tells the reader about events in 1971, and ... uh ... that's it. -- Hoary (talk) 00:59, 23 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Certifications for IPv6[edit]
Am I allowed to mention engineer certifications for IPv6 as a section for IPv6 or an article? ==
Title. I am from NLTVC Education and I would like to make additions to the subject mentioned in the title. Is there anything I need to be aware of? Thanks.
The sources I currently have:

https://edu.nltvc.com/?page_id=731 (I am aware this is possibly biased)

Many things...
The WMF's terms of use require you to declare your status as a paid editor - see WP:PAID. Please do this before making any further edits.
The first ipv6forum.com source is just a list of companies. What do you intend using it to show? Wikipedia is not a directory.
The nltvc.com source is a primary source, With your conflict of interest it would be seen as advertising if you used it. WP:PSTS provides guidance on the types of sources and their acceptability. Strive for reliable, verifiable, independent sources.
Not a Wikipedia issue but the second ipv6forum.com source switches between mentioning the IETF and the IPv6 forum as if they were the same without directly saying whether it is or not. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
The topic may be notable but trying to squeeze it into IPv6 seems like squeezing driver's license into car. I'd suggest you start at WP:AFC using the guidance you can find at your first article.

1.The WMF's terms of use require you to declare your status as a paid editor - see WP:PAID. Please do this before making any further edits.
Does this include the chat at teahouse? This is otherwise clear about the article mentioned.
2.The first ipv6forum.com source is just a list of companies. What do you intend using it to show?
"This Certification is recognized worldwide by leading vendors including CISCO, Huawei, and Juniper Networks as Authorized Training Providers" This statement here, about the IPv6 forum education program. I am not sure if it needs to be included.
3. The nltvc.com source is a primary source, With your conflict of interest it would be seen as advertising if you used it. WP:PSTS provides guidance on the types of sources and their acceptability. Strive for reliable, verifiable, independent sources.

4.Not a Wikipedia issue but the second ipv6forum.com source switches between mentioning the IETF and the IPv6 forum as if they were the same without directly saying whether it is or not. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
Yeah, I can see how that's an issue regarding sources. Do I need to find another reference source? I can't seem to find any mention of their about us page elsewhere, like in https://ipv6forum.com/ .
5.The topic may be notable but trying to squeeze it into IPv6 seems like squeezing driver's license into car. I'd suggest you start at WP:AFC using the guidance you can find at your first article.
Noted. Thanks for answering if it should be a new article.
With these answered, I would like to ask one more question.
Currently the draft article that my supervisor has mostly filled up seems more like a product placement stating how Authorized Training Providers as stated by the first source would teach the subject.

Draft Declined - references[edit]
Hello - I've been asked to write an article regarding an organization. The draft
(Draft:Rehabilitation_Medicine_Society_of_Australia_and_New_Zealand) was declined due to the references "not showing that the subject qualifies for a Wikipedia article". While I understand that referring the website is not enough, I thought the other references met the expectations for a wikipedia article (independent, reliable, secondary). I have read other wikipedia articles that had less references. Is there anything else I can do with the references to show that this organization qualifies for a Wikipedia article? Drgdfry (talk) 10:17, 23 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Drgdfry Hello.
Please read other stuff exists. Each article or draft is judged on its own merits and not based on the presence of other articles that themselves may be inappropriate and just not yet addressed by a volunteer. There are many ways for inappropriate content to exist on Wikipedia, this cannot justify adding more inappropriate content.
As this is a volunteer project where people do what they can, when they can, it is possible for inappropriate content to get by us, even for years. We can only address what we know about. If you would like to help us, please identify these other articles you have seen so action can be taken and we reduce the chances that others will do what you did.
We are only as good as the people who choose to help us.
For that reason it is a poor- if understandable- idea to use any random article as a model or example. If you want to use other articles as a model or example, use those that are classified as good articles, which have received community vetting. 331dot (talk) 10:24, 23 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Your draft just tells of the activities of the organization, it doesn't summarize what independent reliable sources with significant coverage have chosen on their own to say about the organization and what makes it a notable organization as Wikipedia defines one. 331dot (talk) 10:26, 23 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
One very important aspect is where the references come from. Here's an example that might help: if I come to you suggesting that we go into business together, will you take the word of my friends and family that I'm honest? Or will you hope for references that are not so biased? TooManyFingers (talk) 16:59, 23 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
There are way too few references for an article of that size. There are entire sections without a single reference. Either remove them or add more citations mgjertson (talk) (contribs) 17:53, 23 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Then you may go ahead and submit it for review. 331dot (talk) 12:43, 23 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The plot and cast sections are entirely unsourced, fix that and try resubmitting mgjertson (talk) (contribs) 17:55, 23 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I can give some suggestions here so that the draft gets better. Hope it helps!
The lead should be at least 100 words, it is too short right now.
The plot section and the cast section need sources.
The production section and the release section should be expanded, if sources can be found to help with the expansions. Right now, they only have some sentences each.
It is common convention to write the reception section as prose, not as lists.
EarthDude (wanna talk?) 18:25, 23 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Contrary to what was said above, a plot section in an article about a movie does not need references.

Paid edits for Ian Cheshire[edit]
Wiki profile in need of employment updates.
Paid edits for a biography update for Ian Cheshire (businessman)
As part of my employment at Landsec (as Digital Content Manager), I have been asked by Ian Cheshire (the person in question above), to update his Wiki page. I'm having some difficulty.
I've disclosed my profile as paid edits, but really I just need to pass to someone a word document with the proposed edits. I am not proficient enough to use citations on Wiki correctly, or perhaps structure too.
To save any more back and forth with mods and Geoffrey Lane, can I pass a word document to someone who can update Ian's wiki profile for me? Thanks Olliegb619 (talk) 18:33, 23 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I fixed your link, the whole url is not needed. The content of the encyclopedia is best thought of as articles, not "wiki profiles".
That's not really how things work here; editing decisions are made on wiki, for openness and transparency. You may use the edit request wizard to propose your edits. 331dot (talk) 18:38, 23 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I went down the request edit route, as requested by another volunteer. But I don't have the proficiency to embed the edits appropriately. Is there anyone I can pass a word document of proposed edits too, that can upload for me? And yes articles. Ian's employment history is very out of date, and this is why he is asking for it to be updated, quite fairly. Olliegb619 (talk) 18:46, 23 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

I think it's not really a problem in taking inspiration for upgrades or collect references, etc from AI until or unless it Violet any Wikipedia rules but i prefer and tell everyone to find and write and do everything from start by yourself and don't use AI in a large amount.
Abdullah1099 (talk) 04:04, 24 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
But why use it in ANY amount? Using AI is a clear and obvious admission that you are incompetent. TooManyFingers (talk) 05:19, 24 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
That's why i am telling to prefer writing it by yourself and do not use AI as much as as possible. Abdullah1099 (talk) 06:03, 24 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
But to "not use AI as much as possible" is just to never use it. There's never a case where someone needs to use AI.
Being in a hurry to get an article written and put up, and not even caring what's in it, is really bad - and I'm afraid that's probably the biggest reason it gets used.
If, for example, someone felt they needed AI to cover for their lack of skill in some area, then they would have no way of knowing if the AI result was flawed - they'd be blindly submitting material, having no clue if it was good.
I could use AI to write about advanced geometry, but the writing would be garbage because I don't know the subject. TooManyFingers (talk) 17:30, 24 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Copy-editing notice[edit]
Hello, I was just wondering if someone was free to check whether the copy-editing notice is still needed on Dmytro Dontsov. I did a rushed rewrite of the page back in July which was then sent off for a GA review and the reviewer put the notice on the page, mainly because of an abundance of run-off sentences.
Since then, I've rewritten and expanded it (it's still lacking an appropriate lede and legacy section) and these issues have hopefully been fixed with the assistance of other editors. Thanks.¬†Joko2468 (talk) 19:45, 23 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
When I read the "Ideology and style" section, my head hurts a little. There is quite a lot of "using fancy language just for the sake of using fancy language", so much that it begins to obscure the points being made. It's probably not wrong, but I consider it poorly written because it can be said much more plainly and clearly. TooManyFingers (talk) 19:56, 23 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I get it's a bit technical but for instance I can't paraphrase "voluntarism" to say something different, that's how the source describes it and it's linked to for readers to learn about. At least that's what I think you mean? Reading the original sources on the matter hurt my head as well. Joko2468 (talk) 20:05, 23 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I don't mean the words - not mainly, anyway, though there are some. I mean that many of the sentences are far more complicated than they need to be. People who read this article are being put through an unnecessary and very distracting course in trick-sophisticated writing skills, when they only came here to find out about Dontsov.
(My friends often complain that my use of language is over-the-top, but compared with this article, my writing is child's play.)
I will jokingly suggest that you find a few random eleven-year-old volunteers to explain back to you what the article is saying.¬†:) TooManyFingers (talk) 20:22, 23 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Maybe I could post something in Wikipedia:WikiProject Philosophy and see if they can help. Joko2468 (talk) 20:20, 23 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Possibly ... but if you just greatly simplify the sentences, that should do the job. TooManyFingers (talk) 20:24, 23 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Thanks but do you mean just in the Ideology and style section or the whole article? Do you have the time to give me an example so I can understand? Joko2468 (talk) 20:25, 23 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I'll look TooManyFingers (talk) 20:29, 23 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Here's an example, in which I've taken part of your sentence and made my own version:
______
Dontsov biographer Trevor Erlacher characterises his personality and the all-encompassing taxonomy of his largely discontinuous body of work as 'iconoclastic authoritarianism', ...
______
Trevor Erlacher characterises both Dontsov's personality and his work as 'iconoclastic authoritarianism', ...
______
I only cut out excess descriptive language and redundant material (redundant because we very soon get a footnote showing that Erlacher is a biographer). This is much easier to read, and in my opinion it loses nothing that was of any importance. TooManyFingers (talk) 20:38, 23 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Thanks, the purpose of "discontinuous" was originally to explain the vagueness of his characterisation but that's already been added above. I couldn't think of a better word than "taxonomy". I tend to try to shoehorn in as much meaning as possible which makes it tough to evaluate what's necessary. Joko2468 (talk) 20:44, 23 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Page pulled in 2021[edit]
My page got pulled in 2021 - and we don't know what to do.
Hi, I had a page up for years, started and updated by people I do not know, and when my team added a few new items in 2021, they pulled my page, saying I did not have the proper notoriety to have a page.
I'm a veteran filmmaker, won awards since 1990's.
And now I am a published scientist - many articles peer-reviewed and cited many times, have had many articles written on my team's work, many books that include my team's work.
I've been interviewed on national TV and radio, been on scores of podcasts.
Our social media campaign has just top 140 million views.
We are absolutely wanting to follow Wikipedia rules - and I'm a donor to Wikipedia because I support its mission.
We do not know what to do at this point - we feel a page for me reflects Wikipedia's requirements.
We are open to any help.

I wrote an article on Afsana Lachaux and it was deleted. How can I rewrite it so that it isn't deleted again? Akali1880 (talk) 21:27, 23 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
It was not deleted, it was moved to Draft:Afsana Lachaux where you may work on it and submit it for a review before it is formally part of the encyclopedia. The draft is completely unsourced with no indication of notability. Please see Your first article.
You muat disclose your connection to her(you took a very professional looking image of her), see WP:PAID and WP:COI. 331dot (talk) 21:32, 23 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Ah, understood. I embedded the sources within the text rather than list them at the bottom. I had checked and believe that Afsana Lachaux does meet the criteria for notability. I have followed her story from when she was trapped in Dubai, then all her legal cases in the UK and her work in the charity sector. Akali1880 (talk) 22:39, 23 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The criteria for notability leave almost no room for belief. If someone is extremely close to meeting the criteria, maybe a little bit of belief helps - but a large majority of those who don't meet the criteria are not close at all.
A person is not notable because their story is compelling; they are notable because of how many reliable third-party sources have already told that story. TooManyFingers (talk) 04:27, 24 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Issue with edit request[edit]
Hey, I was going through some of the edit requests on user:AnomieBOT/SPERTable and I saw an request on an not-protected page. It turned out to have been intended as a COI request, so I set it to answered and asked the person to fix their request, but I am here to ask if there is maybe a technical problem? I saw on the template page for the template they had used, that it is supposed to default to COI requests if the page it is on is not protected. And yet‚Ä¶ it showed up as a semi-protected edit request.
thanks in advance

(edit conflict) @Slomo666 and PhoenixCaelestis: It appears that they had used the {{request edit}} template, which is a redirect to {{Edit protected}}, which says it defaults to "semi", not "COI", and doesn't even seem to have an option for "COI". (OTOH, that doc doesn't mention that it ignores the level parameter if the page is protected at a different level.) Where are you seeing something saying that the template they used is supposed to default to COI requests? Please ping on reply if my attention is needed, not watchlisting this page. Anomie‚öî 13:26, 24 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
You are right. I think I was looking at the page Template:Request edit button where it does say it will use {{edit COI}} if no protection is given/exists, and must have confused it for the request edit one.
@NotAGenious I am answering your question in this reply as well. I made a mistake when I was trying to figure out what went wrong.
It seems then that I don‚Äôt quite know why the COI edit-requester made the mistake, but it doesn‚Äôt appear to have been a technical issue (based on what you both have told me).
Thanks for explaining.
Slomo666 (talk) 14:01, 24 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Slomo666¬†: For non-protected pages, Template:Edit protected automatically makes a semi-protected edit request ({{#invoke:protected edit request|{{if empty|{{{level|}}}|semi}}}} - if level parameter is empty, uses the page's protection level, else sets a semi protected edit request).

Neeraj Churi (producer of Sabar Bonda)[edit]
Hi everyone,
I wanted to ask for guidance on whether it would be appropriate to create a Wikipedia article about Neeraj Churi. He is a film producer who produced Cactus Pears an Indian-Marathi queer film that won World Cinema Grand Jury Prize Dramatic. There are others listed as producer but the media coverage and his interviews elicit that he was the force behind the film.
Beyond this film, he has produced several other notable works such as Sheer Qorma (film), Ek Jagah Apni (screened at Cannes). I noticed that WP:Author gives notability to authors if their books have significant reviews in reliable sources. Is similar perspective taken for film producers?
There is also coverage on him solely but they are interviews. Such as at Scroll.in conducted by Sharif D Rangnekar [1] and at Mid-Day [2]. He runs a grant with KASHISH Pride Film Festival and has been a jury for a long time.
Thanks in advance for your guidance Aubmgc2025 (talk) 14:05, 24 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Interviews don't count toward notability. Also, while WP:NAUTHOR does say that multiple reviews of their works means the subject is likely to be notable, it isn't a definite thing. In practice, this isn't really a good criterion, because notability is not inherited. It is possible for a book to be notable while the author is not. Likewise, it is common for a wine to be notable while the winemaker is not, and song to be notable but the songwriter is not (although in the case of a musical recording, the artist must be notable before we can have an article on the recording).
In my years on Wikipedia, I have seen that it is difficult for a producer to qualify for an article, especially if all you have are interviews. The film producer isn't an "author". A film producer typically plans, coordinates, arranges financing, and makes administrative decisions, but wouldn't be considered a "creative professional" in the creation of the film. I would say WP:NAUTHOR doesn't apply but WP:GNG does. ~Anachronist (talk) 14:31, 24 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Not just the boldfacing, but the phrasing, with unsubstantiated AI-puffery editorializing such as "became the cornerstone", "laid the groundwork", "widely used", "significantly advancing", "continues to refine", all without citations. I haven't checked if the sources that are cited are hallucinated.
But no, as it is now, @Harold Foppele: that history section wouldn't be acceptable in the article without a major rewrite. As for the position, a history section typically occurs early on in the article. ~Anachronist (talk) 14:56, 24 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Pseudo-Drafting - Is this okay?[edit]
So, I'm planning to write an article on the upcoming game Pony Island 2. This game is not even released yet, let alone notable. I do want to start fiddling with writing it, though, but again, not notable enough to be a draft. Would this be suitable to make in userspace (e.g. User:Fractal-Dreamz/PonyIsland2)? Or would that be a misuse of userspace? I'd prefer not to do it in a sandbox, nor outside Wikipedia because of templates, infoboxes, etc., but if I can't, then I can't. Any advice is appreciated. FractalDreamz ‚úØ 16:09, 24 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I don't have an official or reliable answer, but it seems to me that, compared to writing a good article with quality references, templates and infoboxes are really easy. I would write such an article entirely "at home" without Wikipedia, in plain text, and then much later paste it into somewhere on Wikipedia and add the missing bells and whistles. TooManyFingers (talk) 16:41, 24 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
You could do it that way or as a regular draft. Help:Userspace draft states that "In an RfC regarding the applicability of Wikipedia:Notability to drafts within the userspace and draftspace, community consensus determined that "notability guidelines do not apply to userspace and draftspace drafts.""
If you make it in userspace, I'd recommend using Template:Userspace draft to make it clear that it's a draft article. If you make it in draftspace, note that drafts that have not been edited in six months may be deleted under criterion for speedy deletion G13--but they shouldn't be deleted for failing notability, as I understand it.

Hello, @Fractal-Dreamz, and welcome to the Teahouse.
While, as others have indicated, there is nothing forbidding it, writing a draft before the subject becomes notable is may be a considerable waste of time.
To use a house-building analogy, it is like building the walls before you have surveyed the plot of land, or even determined that it is suitable for building on.
Whether a subject is notable depends almost entirely on whether it gets written about, by people unconnected with it, in reliable publications - and there is no way to predict whether that will happen.
If it doesn't happen, there can be no article, and all your work will be wasted.
If it does happen, it will be possible to write an article - but that article should be a summary of what those independent sources say, which you don't yet know; so you might have to junk what you've written and start again.
For example, suppose the critics all think the that the game is terrible. If enough of them write about it at length, there can be an article; but the bulk of the article should be summarising how those critics pan it.
Whatever they say, information available at present is likely to play a small part in writing the article. ColinFine (talk) 17:49, 24 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Edits across many pages that remove image sizing[edit]
@38.210.0.65 has been removing image size settings across many pages with no edit summary. For example see this change to Logistic function. Are these edits appropriate? Johnjbarton (talk) 16:27, 24 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I think there are probably some arguable reasons for wanting to do what that editor did, but doing it without any discussion or even an edit summary seems like a bad idea. TooManyFingers (talk) 16:59, 24 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Editing[edit]
How do you edit to add figures with backed up sources Reliance research (talk) 16:39, 24 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I'm not sure I understand your question--what do you mean by figures? Could you give an example? SomeoneDreaming (talk) 16:51, 24 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
One important step is to make sure that your sources are ones that Wikipedia considers reliable. Please see Wikipedia:Reliable sources to know how that works. TooManyFingers (talk) 17:10, 24 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Auto-confirmed and extended-confirmed[edit]
Hello in well, what is the difference between auto confirmed and extended confirmed? Is it automatic or manual? UnityDecit555 (talk) 18:49, 24 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hello @UnityDecit555. Being confirmed means your account is 4 days old and has completed at least 10 edits (when given automatically, which is usually the case, you are "autoconfirmed"). Being confirmed allows you to create articles, edit semi-protected pages, etc. Being extended-confirmed (also given automatically most of the time) requires 500 edits and a 30 day old account and allows for more permissions.

H0iadfpwijdf, I quote the text in its entirety: "ROW ROW Fight the Powah". Fuzheado deleted this as "Patent nonsense, meaningless, or incomprehensible". -- Hoary (talk) 22:40, 24 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
It was a picture of a person rowing against the current, and I marked it for speedy deletion under WP:G1. See what wikipedia is not, and Wikipedia is not a collection of memes or "lulzy pages".

Feedback on whether something meets notability threshold?[edit]
Hi ... I am a relatively new employee at a company that I believe meets the notability threshold that would merit a dedicated Wikipedia article. I am aware of the need to disclose that relationship in the course of article submission. I know the bar for this type of article is high (rightfully so), but I just want to gut check that I'm correct in my notability assessment before submitting the article. Basically I don't want to waste anyone's time if the endeavor is doomed from the start.
For context, Equilar is a 25 year old company that works in executive data and intelligence. The main element that warrants a notability discussion in my opinion is that its data is frequently and extensively cited by major independent media outlets on the subject of executive compensation, CEO pay in particular. Equilar experts are frequently cited in these articles, it is more than just a cursory mention or quick data point.
I've included a representative but far from exhaustive group of potential citations below.
New York Times
The Rich Compensation for Being CEO (2025)
A New Measure Shows CEO Pay at Even More Astronomical Levels (2024)
Associated Press
How AP and Equilar Calculated CEO Pay (2025)
Wall St. Journal
Is There a Relationship Between High CEO Pay and Effectiveness (2022)
The Hollywood Reporter
The Hollywood CEO Pay Mega Chart Revealed (2025)
Harvard Business Review
We Know Female CEOs Get Paid More, But We Don't Know Why (2017)
This is far from an exhaustive list of possible citations, but I chose these to establish the following:
- While not necessarily the subject of these articles, Equilar data often represents the bulk of if not the entirety of the foundation for the reporting, including regular annual studies done in partnership with the New York Times and Associated Press (to be clear Equilar is only involved from a data standpoint. There is no editorial control over the content itself on Equilar's part).
- In addition to providing data, Equilar is frequently quoted as an expert on topics of executive compensation and corporate governance (see Hollywood Reporter and Wall St Journal articles as examples).
- The Harvard Business Review article is a bit older but I included it to reflect that these types of citations have been occurring for a significant number of years, as well as another case of Equilar research representing the entire news peg for the story. If it would help, there are similar citations going back as far as 2002, I just didn't want to overdo it from a quantity standpoint.
I can include some citations on topics beyond CEO pay if they would be of interest, though the CEO compensation data definitely yields the most substantial citations in independent media because of widespread public interest in the topic.
I recognize these do not quite rise to the level of, say, a full-on feature or profile on the company, but I feel they do clearly rise above the level of citation Wikipedia considers to be trivial according to its guidelines. CEO pay in particular continues to be a highly socially relevant issue for a number of reasons, and Equilar is a frequently cited and quoted authority on that topic across a wide swath of independent media. I believe it is reasonable to the public interest to have a Wikipedia article establishing the nature of the origin of that data.
If there are any particular types of citations missing from the above that would be helpful, I am happy to provide additional reporting.
Thanks for taking the time taken to evaluate the above, and if Equilar is deemed to meet the notability guidelines I would look forward to following all processes and guidelines in creating the article.

Hello, @MCLynch121, and welcome to the Teahouse. Thank you for being open about your status, and asking before you dive in.
It doesn't seem to me as if citations of that sort are significant coverage, and it's also not clear that they are independent of Equilar. Please evaluate each of your sources against all the criteria in the golden rule: only if a source meets all of these can it contribute to establishing notability.
Note that qualities such as "social relevance" often get mentioned as a reason that this or that draft should be accepted, or article not deleted. Such qualities are irrelevant to the question of whether the subject is notable. ColinFine (talk) 21:22, 24 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Thanks for the feedback. Can I just go in-depth on one of the citations that would maybe clarify my point a little bit. It would seem to me that this does rise to the level of "significant coverage" as outlined by Wikipedia.
Take the Hollywood Reporter article. This is an independent media source that built it's article about CEO pay in Hollywood entirely around the Equilar 100 annual report on the highest paid CEOs. Here's a passage of the article for context:
"However, one trend of the past kept up. Many Hollywood top executives‚Äô pay packages ended up above the median total compensation for this year‚Äôs first-take Equilar 100 list, compiled by the data firm based on annual compensation disclosures by the largest companies by revenue across multiple sectors. (That list was revealed at the end of March, meaning various big entertainment players are excluded.) The Equilar 100 median total pay was $25.6 million, which represents a 9.5 perfect increase for the same set of companies from the previous year.
Looking at the broader entertainment industry compensation compiled by THR, many toppers received ‚Äúsizable‚Äù long-term stock or options awards, notes Amit Batish, senior director of content at data firm Equilar. ‚ÄúDespite weak stock performance at some of these companies, the media and entertainment industry is constantly evolving, and both companies and boards prioritize long-term stability in their top executive roles. This desire for continuity may help explain why many of these pay packages exceed the median in our study.‚Äù
For comparison, and taking a broader view across all industries, the Equilar list is led by Jim Anderson, the CEO of Coherent Corp. (which makes equipment for networks and lasers), whose compensation package amounted to $101.5 million. Microsoft boss Satya Nadella ranks fourth with $79.1 million, followed by Apple CEO Tim Cook with $74.6 million."
So you have a major independent media outlet 1) Using Equilar data as the entire foundation for its article 2) Quoting from an Equilar employee and treating them as an expert on the topic.
As the guidelines on significant coverage note: "Significant coverage is more than a trivial mention, but it does not need to be the main topic of the source material."
There are many citations available along these lines in very reputable, independent publications. If the above wouldn't qualify as "significant" then I would likely cease the attempt but I am also struggling to find which part of the stated guidelines this example would fail to meet. MCLynch121 (talk) 22:03, 24 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I think it's important that they be discussing Equilar - that they intend to be telling a story about Equilar, rather than using the company's services to tell someone else's story. If it's inside a different story that's fine, but we should be able to point out the part where they directly discuss Equilar for a significant length.

More formal tone[edit]
I have an article that I have drafted for a consumer electronics company. Despite it looking like articles for other consumer goods companies, the reviewers said I needed a more neutral tone. I have eliminated all subjective phrases and only cite out to 3rd party reviewers for any statements about the products qualities and consumer satisfaction. I am not sure how to offer a more neutral tone so any help would be much appreciated. Here is a link to the draft article: Draft:TP-Link Systems. Thank you for any assistance in VisualEditor.
Gguice (talk) 21:22, 24 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
How much primary sourcing would you say the article contains right now? Things that are in there because you know them, not because the public already knew? TooManyFingers (talk) 22:45, 24 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I haven't read the article. But I did glance at it, whereupon I immediately noticed (i) citation of Wikipedia (shown by |url=https://en.wikipedia.org); (ii) "In 2024, TP-Link held a 36.6% unit share (and 31% dollar share) of the U.S. direct-to-consumer router market", citing TP-Link for this. First, do not cite Wikipedia. Secondly, do not cite the company itself, other perhaps than for matters that are minor and can't be described as achievements. -- Hoary (talk) 22:52, 24 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hello, @Gguice. "Despite it looking like articles for other consumer goods companies" is not relevant. We have many thousands of seriously deficient articles, mostly from an earlier era when we weren't so careful, simply because not many volunteeers want to spend time trawling through them. See other stuff exists. Drafts are reviewed on their own, not against existing articles. ColinFine (talk) 23:11, 24 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
