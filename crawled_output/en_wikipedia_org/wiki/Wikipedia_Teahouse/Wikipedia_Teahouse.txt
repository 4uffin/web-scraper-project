IP Peer Review.[edit]
Peer Review Guidelines is not clear on whether IP editors can nominate for PR. Though I won't remember to do it by the time I get home. I know intellectually that its unlikely due to IP editors not being able to create pages however.

I see nothing to prevent an IP address from requesting a peer review. The only thing that would stop you is a semi-protected talk page. Otherwise, just follow the instructions. ~Anachronist (talk) 14:48, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

because I can't log in within Georgetown Independent School District at all. The district decided to remove access to central auth early last school year.

Help Me See Edit Revert As Good Faith[edit]
A one-sentence edit I made last week was reverted. This is the first time a revert has happened to me. Reading WP:RV and WP:ROWN, it did not seem to me that a revert was warranted.
I started a discussion on the talk page: Talk:TESCREAL#Considering RfC regarding sentence about the origin Three other editors (not the one who did the revert) have replied, very briefly, to my lengthy explanation of my edit. I am having trouble seeing the revert as having been done in good faith, and these replies have not helped. Can someone please help me see it that way? Perhaps if someone who understands their POV restates it a bit less tersely, I will get it. Aurodea108 (talk) 19:09, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hello, @Aurodea108. As I can't see why you think the edit was in bad faith, I'm not sure that I can help you to not see it that way, but I'll stick my twopennyworth in.
A Wikipedia article should be a summary of what the sources say about the subject, not what you (or I, or other editors) know, think, or believe about the subject.
If a source does not directly say anything about the subject (specifically) then it is hard to see why that source should be cited, or what can relevantly go into the article on the basis of that source. If the source does not specifically say that it is about the origin of TESCREAL, then it cannot be used to support a statement about the origin of TESCREAL.
I also suggest that if several editors disagree with you then it's time to drop the stick. ColinFine (talk) 19:59, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Thank you @ColinFine for taking the time to reply to me extensively.
I take it you have already read completely the posts I made in that discussion thread, for which I also thank you.
The source grouped the TESCREAL paper among several earlier papers, which it described as seeing AI in a certain way.
If I understand you correctly, in order for the source to be relevant, it would have had to say explicitly something like, "First Kalluri wrote that AI may 'build systems that sanctify the status quo and advance the interests of the powerful', then Birhane and Guest wrote...then...and most recently, Gebru and Torres came up with the acronym TESCREAL to describe the ideologies they see as underpinning AI. These are
some of the authors that see ‚ÄòAI‚Äô as a way to advance capitalist, kyriarchal, authoritarian and/or white supremacist goals." The source said this succinctly, expecting the reader to be able to follow the references and unpack their clause into something like what I just wrote, rather than explicitly. Hence the source did not explicitly use the word "TESCREAL" and is being seen by you and others as not relevant.
If indeed I am understanding you correctly, then I would respond that the hypothetical passage I just wrote is more like what a good professor might write for their lower-division undergraduate students, and is not to be expected in a research-level academic paper.
The unpacking that I just did is almost a mechanical exercise, and should not change the answer to whether the source is relevant or not.
Part of the reason I am wondering about bad faith is what I am seeing as nitpicking about a stylistic choice on the part of the source.
Part of my reason for wondering about bad faith is admittedly due to the history of that page, some of which can be seen at the Talk page (some has been archived). It seems to me that my sentence, which is about a "meta" question (where did the idea of TESCREAL come from?) may have been reverted because other, less "meta", questions (does TESCREAL describe a real phenomenon? should TESCREAL be described on WP?) are contentious.
As for whether to "drop the stick", I will keep your suggestion in mind and give it some time. Aurodea108 (talk) 22:11, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
No, @Aurodea108, I haven't closely read the posts. I (and I think the other editors) are arguing on the basis of Wikipedia policy. If it is not discussed in one of the sources, it should not be discussed in the article. Period. ColinFine (talk) 22:22, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I've read through the discussion, and broadly agree with the other editors. I see zero evidence of bad faith in the replies, and I would echo ColinFine's note and argue that it would be a good idea for you to drop the stick. You introduced a source, several others have disagreed about its relevance, and part of functioning in Wikipedia is for one to recognize that consensus will frequently be against their own opinion. CoffeeCrumbs (talk) 02:42, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Disagreeing with an edit is not a reason to revert it. The OP's edit wasn't in bad faith so it shouldn't have been reverted. Period. If @Avatar317 disagreed with the edit, they could have revised it or just deleted it or started a discussion on the talk page. Reverting isn't just rude - it's confrontational because we know the editor will receive a notification saying their change has been reverted. @Aurodea108 My advice - take on board the feedback that you've since received on the sentence and sources. If you still want to add your amendment, add a revised sentence assuming that instead of reverting, you'd had the discussion first. (ps. I think the 7 sources after "several earlier ones" is a bit much.) MmeMaigret (talk) 03:08, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
It sounds like you don't understand how Wikipedia functions.
If I remove recently added content (whether I do that operation by simply removing it OR by reverting an edit or series of edits) it APPEARS with the automated summary tag in italics "Reverted."
Sure, the other editor doesn't get a notice unless I do the "revert" function, but that editor's addition/contribution is removed, so exactly the same result.
And per WP:BRD that is the way we edit; and when an editor gets Reverted, they get pinged on what others felt was wrong with their edit so they can modify it and re-add; otherwise they might not notice that someone removed their addition, so it can be seen as confrontational (your view) or as a more efficient way of collaboration. (Additionally, a removal can be seen as a bad-faith "stealth revert", so that to me seems worse, I'd rather someone see and understand my issue with their edit(s).)
As noted in my edit summary, I felt that that source does not adequately support the added statement.
I can understand how someone could read that source and say to themselves "oh, I see, this author is lumping together multiple papers about AI and one of them is the Gebru/TESCEAL paper."
But our policy on WP:SYNTH says: "Do not ... state or imply a conclusion not explicitly stated by any of the sources."
And here the author (van Rooij) never mentions TESCREAL even once in the entire paper. ---Avatar317(talk) 05:30, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Press edit, delete the sentence, press save, leave a summary. Not a reversion. What part of that was hard for you to understand? You might also have a re-read of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reverting#When%20to%20revert MmeMaigret (talk) 17:17, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
You linked to an ESSAY, not policy.
What part of "a removal can be seen as a bad-faith "stealth revert", so that to me seems worse, I'd rather someone see and understand my issue with their edit(s)" is hard for you to understand?
Providing no feedback to someone and fixing their mistakes without their knowledge doesn't help them become a better editor. ---Avatar317(talk) 22:37, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Again, because you clearly missed it "they could have revised it or just deleted it or started a discussion on the talk page".MmeMaigret (talk) 03:39, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Standardize image size in infobox[edit]
Hi, I'm a new editor and I had a question on how I could standard the size of the blade images for the draft I'm working on. I have two blade SVG's I made that are in the infobox, and the men's blade SVG is noticeably smaller than the woman's blade even though I used the same Wikipedia commons SVG as a base for both.
Is there a way to standardize the size for the two images or at least make one match the other? Here is the draft that I'm talking about. Thanks, Pixzzl. Pixzzl (talk) 21:44, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Would it work to merge the two SVGs into one, so that they're both there but as top and bottom of one picture? TooManyFingers (talk) 21:53, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I could try to do that, but creating them with Inkscape was hard enough on it's own and I honestly don't know how to merge them. Is there no way to just set the size for them? Pixzzl (talk) 21:59, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Pixzzl According to the documentation at {{Infobox rowing club}}, the image parameter is supposed to be used for a picture of the clubhouse/boathouse, not as a way to force in a second blade image. I suspect that's why your two images are coming out at different default sizes. Maybe the solution would be to place one blade image only in the infobox and put the second one as a thumb image within the main text. If you want to add both as a single blade image, as suggested above, then that should be easy using Inkscape and I'll help if you ask via my talk page. Mike Turnbull (talk) 10:34, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Ah, okay. I can do this. Later today if I send a message on your talk page would you be able to help me? Thanks, Pixzzl. Pixzzl (talk) 12:06, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Pixzzl I've done the merged file, which would probably be best if uploaded to Commons by you, as it is based on your originals. You don't seem to have set an email address for your account. If you do that, I'll email the .svg to you. I won't see what your address is unless you reply to my own message. Mike Turnbull (talk) 13:30, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Ah, thank you so much! You can email me [redacted] Pixzzl (talk) 20:43, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Please set up email in your user preferences; don't post your address here. Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 12:05, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Sorry, I'll do that. Pixzzl (talk) 12:32, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Pixzzl I hope you don't mind; I added a couple of missing apostrophes to the text of that draft. David10244 (talk) 22:44, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
why allow paid editing?[edit]
hello! I have a question. why is it that wikipedia permits paid editing to occur at all? right now, paid editors have to declare their COI, which is nice, but to me at least it would make more sense to ban paid editing entirely. given all of the scams, and wasted time, and useless questions, and disruptive editors, I think it would be better to make paid editing and COI editing against wikipedia policy. after all, wikimedia doesn't get compensated for paid editing work or anything. of course, I'm not demanding this decades-old policy be changed immediately. I'm just genuinely curious. that's all. thanks! 67.218.119.178 (talk) 22:12, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The consensus of the Wikipedia community has been that if we were to ban paid editing, the paid editors would probably still edit here but would not admit it and thus be more difficult to regulate. MrOllie (talk) 22:20, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
We highly discourage paid editors from editing articles directly. Some of them have useful suggestions, and as for the rest: I expect that people are more likely to comply with disclosure and editing requirements than to respect a strict ban. And given that our scam warning hasn't kept scammers from promising they can publish and protect articles (or alternatively threaten to delete them, as blackmail), I doubt announcing a strict ban would affect them much either. jlwoodwa (talk) 22:24, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I hadn't known that we have paid editors. If they are discouraged from editing articles directly, then what do they edit? I'm just curious; I have no interest in being one. Maurice Magnus (talk) 22:57, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
For existing articles, they can edit talk pages and make edit requests; for new articles, they can create them in draftspace and submit them to Articles for creation. jlwoodwa (talk) 23:00, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
They can also, for example, edit directly if they are reverting egregious vandalism; making uncontroversial factual updates or technical fixes; or adding uncontroversial and non-promotional citations; all providing that appropriate declarations are made. They can also make edits suggested via the edit request process, if they are invited to so so by an independent editor. And see WP:CURATOR. Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 16:42, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
WP:COIADVICE. And of course, they can do un-paid editing. Gr√•bergs Gr√•a S√•ng (talk) 06:16, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Maurice Magnus, "assistance with writing a wikipedia page" (above) may interest you. -- Hoary (talk) 07:52, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Not all paid editors are ill-intentioned scammers! For example, it's quite likely that when there's a staff reshuffle at a university, and there's a new vice-chancellor, it will be some random member of faculty, grad student or post-doc who first notices that Wikipedia hasn't caught up. They aren't necessarily employed by the university's comms department, but because they're employed by the university, they're paid editors. They are, however, quite useful. Elemimele (talk) 12:55, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Some paid editors are very helpful in keeping articles up-to-date. Some I interact with provide relevant photographs and suggest new sources that can be used: all via article talk pages, as required by the COI provisions. Mike Turnbull (talk) 13:19, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

--pro-anti-air ping me for template replies 22:29, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Pro-anti-air: If it is open source you can import and change the code. However using Wikipedia should
follow the policies here, and also I hope the user understands what they are doing. Normally you should get more experience with doing things manually before using an automated tool. Otherwise you won't understand what the tool is doing. Auto/confirmed is not a big hurdle. In fact you are an extended confirmed user, so I expect you already have the experience to understand what it does. Graeme Bartlett (talk) 07:02, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Graeme Bartlett I mean User:AntoEh/twinkle.js, but they are probably autoconfirmed by now.

Ilikeyoshi, by "unreadable pale green on white", Andy Mabbett is saying that your pale green lettering is unreadable on a white background. The fact that it was you who determined the color combination does not affect its readability. -- Hoary (talk) 23:32, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Whether it's fine for you is immaterial; as is whether its current appearance is deliberate. The issue is whether it's readable for other people. See MOS:COLOUR. Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 10:25, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Whether "these articles look okay" to us in which sense? Whichever Wikipedia article each of these is or might be used on, the Wikipedia article has a talk page; and it's on that talk page that you can ask about the looking-okay-ness of this or that potential source. Though you should be a lot clearer than "[looking] okay to you". Also, be sure to be logged in as Bogwife when you ask, and indeed when you edit in general. -- Hoary (talk) 22:33, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Certificates look fine. But there‚Äôs no WHOIS page for the URLs. Seems like potentially AI-generated and malicious but very subtle? Bogwife (talk) 00:04, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Bogwife Your Talk page starts with "thank you!".
It's not clear who you are thanking.
And it says "I agree with you" and I agree" in a couple of other places.
Who is "you"? David10244 (talk) 22:52, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The first journal looks okay, nothing initially comes up when I look for people discussing it being predatory. In general, I would do that journals as many of them have not been discussed at WP:RSN or WP:RSP. Also, be heavily mindful of WP:MEDRS and note that my strategy is likely not foolproof. ‚ú∂Quxyz‚ú∂ (talk) 22:50, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

A single 2013 study on three children doi:10.1901/jaba.2002.35-213, which is the first link above, will not pass our WP:MEDRS requirement for sources. Mike Turnbull (talk) 11:19, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
That's pretty much why I only analyzed the journal's credentials as to if it was predatory or not; I do not want to finick with MEDRS as I am relatively unqualified in analyzing a source to that level as my fields (history and earth sciences) do not require such depth. ‚ú∂Quxyz‚ú∂ (talk) 13:37, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
When you call it "your discussion", for me that causes a sort of alarm bell. For Wikipedia, it needs to be someone else's discussion. All you can be in the article is a reporter - not a discusser. TooManyFingers (talk) 06:02, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Naming draft to not violate BLP[edit]
Good day, I am interested in writing an article related to a scandal in Florida involving a sheriff [2]. I am not sure exactly what to name it. I was thinking of Osceola County gambling ring scandal but am unsure of the accuracy of that statement and if it would violate policy and/or convention. If anyone could help, that would be great. Thanks, ‚ú∂Quxyz‚ú∂ (talk) 22:46, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Quxyz, you could ask at WP:BLPN. Be sure to point out that the sheriff hasn't yet been tried, let alone convicted. -- Hoary (talk) 00:06, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
In my opinion it would be extremely hard to write a halfway decent article about a legal scandal that hasn't even gone to trial yet. I'm sure everyone in Osceola County knows about it already and doesn't need to get their news here, and I'm also sure that the rest of the world would consider it basically a garbage article until there are verdicts or sentences or whatever needs to happen.

Talk page for an article[edit]
Hello, folks at the Teahouse. I recently created an article, Saji Varghese, but am unable to wrap my head around how its talk page should look/be created. While I have created talk pages for articles in the past, this one seems a bit tricky, especially vis-a-vis the categories, article classification, WikiProjects and everything. Could someone help me out with this? Any help would be appreciated¬†:) Dissoxciate (talk) 07:00, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hey there! Welcome to the Teahouse.
Looks like someone else has set the talk page up with a script that's added everything necessary, but for your knowledge, most talk pages use the {{WikiProject banner shell}} template with a few parameters and other templates. Have a look at the source markup for your talk page to see what's been added there.
Feel free to let me know if you have any questions! Great work starting an article on Wikipedia:) SnowyRiver28 (talk) 07:44, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Sfn & harv[edit]
Hi, friends. I need help because, as always with very "technical or glitchy issues" of references or citations, I do not grasp it fully. I am working on a DYK nomination which I submitted today, and I am a very aesthetic editor, LOL. I think it is great to have books under a different subhead than general references. But I got an error which I don't understand in one of those book citations. Can anybody help me? I've tried myself but I can't decode the error. It's on the article about Lifeboat No. 6 of the Titanic.
Thanks. A lot. Love. CoryGlee (talk) 00:51, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The source Gracie, Archibald; Thayer, John B. (2014). Titanic A Survivor's Story & the Sinking of the S.S. Titanic. Chicago Review Press. ISBN¬†9780897336758. is defined twice, once in the History section and once in the Repeated cited sources section. This means that {{sfn}}, when it's looking for the correct citation, sees two "different" books which could match. You should combine the twin citations by replacing the History citation with {{sfn}} instead.
Minor note, but I think Repeated cited sources is typically called Bibliography. Blepbob (talk) 01:46, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Fixed. Cremastra (talk¬†¬∑ contribs) 02:02, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@CoryGlee, I think this has mostly already been covered, but if you copy the link from a shortened footnote you'll see "#CITEREFGracieThayer2014" or something similar at the end. This is just a basic HTML anchor and a standard part of the web. Each anchor name should be used on a single full citation. If the same name is duplicated across multiple full citations on a page, it's not clear which target the shortened footnote links are meant to point towards.
That's the full explanation for the cryptic error, "Harv error: duplicate target for CITEREFGracieThayer2014." "Harv error" means it is related to sfn/harv citations, "duplicate target" means there are multiple identical anchor names, and "CITEREFGracieThayer2014" is the anchor name that was duplicated.

Visual editor - citations - ref name[edit]
As you know, visual editor inserts sources with the names ":0", ":1", ":2", ":3" etc.
My question is what's the page for asking for a change to how visual editor processes citations.

I only want to know where to suggest a change (in this case, that ref name be added to the available fields if poss)

New editor, question about WP:NPOV[edit]
Hi All,
I was reviewing this article and I came across this passage:
"Students of Nalanda College have consistently participated in national-level examinations, with some achieving high grades in Ordinary Level and Advanced Level exams, as well as in various sports competitions." This passage feels extremely out of place to me, however it has tons of citations on it. There is also an "Awards" section immediately below this that seems address this idea with objective facts.
So do we think this is an appropriate passage? As a new editor, how do I know when a passage is in violation of WP:NPOV if it has citations as well?
TIA,
LuredFreezer LuredFreezer (talk) 16:10, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
As long as the sources are well-referenced, and the references actually back up the information, it seems good to me. It's written in a somewhat braggadocious-seeming way, but it's pretty much just statistics. If you think it could be written in a more encyclopedic way, I invite you to Be Bold and correct it in a manner that you feel is appropriate.
Happy editing!
Commandant Quacks-a-lot (talk) 18:17, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I think maybe NPOV (in its Wikipedia sense) is not exactly the problem, even though neutrality is certainly involved. The issue (if there is one) seems more like WP:COI or WP:Puff, if you think the article is misusing Wikipedia as a promotional tool. (I too would tend to classify this kind of thing as inappropriate promotional material.) TooManyFingers (talk) 18:23, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Thanks to both, this is helpful. I'll noodle on it for a bit and see if I can reword it in a way that feels more fitting for Wikipedia. LuredFreezer (talk) 18:26, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
It's also possible to delete material if it's not appropriate; rewording is not the only way. Many times, something is true but (for reasons other than truth) doesn't belong in an article. TooManyFingers (talk) 18:32, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I've had a look at the 12 references which follow this statement. I think the sentence is synthesis. The references each list one or several students from the school who have achieved high grades. The coverage is mostly passing mentions. I would consider taking out the sentence and related refs. If one of the sources said something along the lines of "Nalanda College students consistently perform well in examinations", that would be different.
On a separate point, I would also consider removing the reference to https://studentlanka.com, as I'm not sure that is a reliable source.
For the three references after this sentence which relate to two former students who are notable for their sporting achievements, I would remove the references from the school article, which does not mention these people, and add the refs at List of Nalanda College Colombo alumni.
You could also ask at WP:WikiProject Schools. Tacyarg (talk) 22:28, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Wiki-style references with EndNote[edit]
Like many other wiki-editors, I use EndNote to generate a list of references.
Wikipedia has it own hypertext (html) formatting style called wiki-text markup: Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Text formatting
Currently EndNote does not provide such output style.
It would be useful for many wiki-editors (especially, those in academia, who have EndNote license via their institutions) to have an option to easily produce wiki-styled references.
I contacted EndNote techsupport, and they told me- someone from Wikipedia have to place a formal request with endnote.com, and they can release this new wiki-format for free. Do you know, who can place such as official request? In case of scientific journals, EndNote accepts requests
from editorial or publishing offices.

Hello, @My planet is Homlos, and welcome to the Teahouse.
Vandalism is editing which is intended to damage Wikipedia. If
you genuinely think an edit you want to make is an improvement to the article in question, it is never vandalism.
Howevert, editors can disagree about what will be best for an article, and that is normal and healthy. So it might be that you make an edit in good faith and somebody disagrees, and reverts your edit: you can then open a discussion with them. Or if you sense that your edit might be controversial, you may choose to start the discussion before trying to make the edit. See WP:BRD for how this works in practice.
Astronomy & Astrophysics appears to be a respected journal, so the paper is almost certainly a reliable source and you can cite information from it - but, as Hoary says, give the full bibliographic information in your citation so that a reader can easily see the journal, authors, date etc. (see WP:REFB for how to cite). ColinFine (talk) 09:52, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I now feel like every edit I do is controversial even if I provided a reliable source. But now I'll try to give the full bibliographic information in my citation. Not like https://... My planet is Homlos (talk) 10:50, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Controversy means people argue about it. In topics like this one, the only way you would cause arguments is if you gave information from a source that doesn't deserve to be trusted, or if you put your own opinions without a source.
I think it's good you're being cautious and not wanting to cause controversy, but in this kind of articles, trustworthy sources and no personal opinions is pretty much a guarantee of no controversy.
If equally reliable sources disagree on something, write in the article saying that they disagree about it, and state their positions so everyone can see for themselves. TooManyFingers (talk) 15:20, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
... and when you're not sure if some source is reliable enough to be used on Wikipedia, the best thing to do is go on the article's Talk page and ask what people there think of it. TooManyFingers (talk) 15:24, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Don't be scared! If you are adding information in good faith, information that you've found somewhere sensible, and you cite your source, then no one is going to be annoyed. The worst case scenario is that someone will disagree and remove it again. If you feel confident, you can use the article's talk-page to ask them why, and to initiate a discussion with other editors. If your addition was genuinely inappropriate, other editors may be able to advise. But you shouldn't feel afraid to make edits, because that is what Wikipedia is: a collaborative effort where each article represents the combination of what multiple people have found, sifted and summarised together. Your input is as valued and important as anyone else's. Elemimele (talk) 16:26, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

It might depend on the word; some non-English words have become sufficiently well used in English that they are no longer considered to need italicisation.

Genre for this singer?[edit]
Hey, I just wanna ask what else I can put in this singer's genre infobox: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colet_(singer)
The source I have (an article recently published by Latest Chika) mentions that Colet, the singer, sings ballads in her solo work. However, I've been told multiple times that ballad isn't considered a genre on Wikipedia. But it does tell you a lot about what kind of music she sings (in her solo work, not as a member of the girl group that she's in): slow, emotional, with a lot of belting. AKA ballads. Hoping for some advice. Bloomagiliw (talk) 02:41, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Bloomagiliw: A genre is a type of music. A ballad is a musical form. There are rock ballads, country ballads, folk ballads, etc. and the genres would be rock, country, and folk, respectively. There are some musicians like Yoko Kanno whose work spans all sorts of genres, and if you look at her infobox you'll see many genres listed. Based on Colet's article, it looks like her genres may be rap and pop. I'm not familiar with her music, however. ~Anachronist (talk) 03:26, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
There are two main things about genres. First, people pretty much 100% agree what you mean when you say them. If I said I was starting a new genre, nobody would pay any attention to me, and they'd be right to ignore my little fantasy. Second, genres group stuff that is the same. We have to start by admitting nobody is so unique. So figure out who she's basically the same as in her music, and use those genres. Trying to pretend everyone's music is super unique and different and supposedly doesn't fit the genres is just a silly game. (She really could be combining some genres, but make sure they're genres that are already recognized.) TooManyFingers (talk) 05:22, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
She's a member of Bini; their genres are P-pop bubblegum pop, EDM, funk, pop rock, teen pop. It also says she's a rapper.
MmeMaigret (talk) 06:57, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
It's her solo page, so it's mentioned in the infobox hidden text that we should list the genres for her solo work. This article (which again is published by Latest Chika, which is under the major newspaper The Philippine Star and is thus considered reliable) mentions that Colet's solo work sounds different from Bini's upbeat and fast songs: https://latestchika.com/just-in/2025/09/18/117807/bini-colet24th-birthday/
The article mentions that she writes songs with her acoustic guitar. It also calls her a balladeer at heart. I don't think the group's genres should be listed on her solo page, as an article from a major media outlet has written that her solo work sounds very different. Bloomagiliw (talk) 07:02, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The most important thing to keep in mind about mentioning musical genres in a Wikipedia article is that adding a reference to a reliable source verifying the genre is mandatory. Countless editors have been blocked or sanctioned for persistently adding unsourced genres. Please read WP:GENREWARRIOR for the gory details. Cullen328 (talk) 07:08, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Yeah. So should I just leave it blank for now? As solo pages should reflect solo work. Again, the article does mention acoustic and ballad. Can I mention acoustic music in the infobox? Bloomagiliw (talk) 07:10, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Infoboxes cause this problem: because they have blanks, people naturally feel a sort of pressure to put something in them. Anything in this infobox is optional, other than what's absolutely basic - which for a performer is their name, their main job, and a picture if there is one.
Yesterday I was editing a short article (one that's unlikely to get much longer). I saw that everything in the infobox was within the first couple of paragraphs anyway, so I deleted the entire box.
If you're writing an article about an exotic mineral, you'll probably want the infobox to be done up nicely, filling in all the blanks you can get the information for. But for a musician it's far less important. Minerals tend to need a lot of information that's just information, like a database. Singers don't.

Draft:Sam Bayat Makoo[edit]
Hello, I have created a draft article for Sam Bayat Makoo (Draft:Sam Bayat Makoo) about a Quebec-licensed attorney and author specializing in immigration law and citizenship by investment programs. The draft uses independent, reliable sources such as Gulf News, Caribbean News Global, The Corporate Immigration Review, and Le Barreau du Qu√©bec to establish notability per WP:NBIO. No self-published sources (e.g., LinkedIn or Bayat Group website) are used. I am seeking feedback on the draft‚Äôs content, sourcing, and neutrality to improve it before submitting to Articles for Creation. Please advise if additional sources, clarifications, or changes are needed to meet Wikipedia‚Äôs standards. Thank you
Draft:Sam Bayat Makoo InsightAdventurer (talk) 13:39, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Do all the sources show that they believe the person is notable? Do any of the sources involve an interview with the subject? TooManyFingers (talk) 14:48, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Thank you, @TooManyFingers, for your questions. I‚Äôve reviewed the sources to ensure they support notability per WP:NBIO and WP:GNG. The current sources in the draft (Draft:Sam Bayat Makoo) are:
The Corporate Immigration Review* (Law Business Research), which independently covers Mr. Bayat‚Äôs contributions to immigration law.
Le Barreau du Qu√©bec*‚Äôs directory, verifying his licensing as a Quebec attorney.
Mona Shah & Partners Podcast* (Episode 203), an independent interview discussing CBI controversies, which provides analytical coverage of his expertise.
The podcast is an interview with Mr. Bayat, but it‚Äôs hosted by an independent attorney (Mona Shah) and focuses on broader industry issues, not just self-reported claims. I decided to remove these sources that appeared non-independent (e.g., Gulf News, Caribbean News Global, IMI Daily) after feedback from other editors. I‚Äôm still searching for additional independent sources to strengthen notability. Do you think these sources are sufficient, or should I seek more with deeper coverage? Thanks for your help! InsightAdventurer (talk) 16:43, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Any interview with Bayat, or any source that quotes such an interview, or any source written by a friend, family member, or business acquaintance of Bayat, can only be used to confirm minor details and neutral facts. They can't be used to justify the idea of writing an article about him. The main sources have to be independently written (no interview) by independent writers (no friends/family/business acquaintances). In other words, showing that reliable sources who don't know Bayat have heard about him and consider him worth writing their own articles about - with no chance that a skeptical person could claim "that writer is working for Bayat or doing him a favour". TooManyFingers (talk) 18:43, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hello, @InsightAdventurer, and welcome to the Teahouse.
It is very obvious that few if any of your sources meet the requirement in the Golden rule. Most of them are very obviously not independent of Makoo, as they are published by his associates or institutions and almost certainly derive from him.
Wikipedia has little interest in what the subject of an article says or wants to say about themselves, or what their associates say about them. Wikipedia is almost exclusively interested in what people who have no connection with the subject, and who have not been prompted or fed information on behalf of the subject, have chosen to publish about the subject in reliable sources. If enough material is cited from independent sources to establish notability, a limited amount of uncontroversial factual information may be added from non-independent sources.
I must also ask whether you have some connection with Makoo or with Bayat Group? If you have, that does not preclude working on an article, but there are restrictions: see conflict of interest. In my experience if the first thing an editor tries doing is to write an article about a business, or a person in a business, they very often have a connection with that business or person, and are very often unaware of Wikipedia's bar on promotion of any kind.
My earnest advice to new editors is to not even think about
trying to create an article until you have spent several weeks - at least - learning about how Wikipedia works by making improvements to existing articles. Once you have understood core policies such as verifiability, neutral point of view, reliable, independent sources, and notability, and experienced how we handle disagreements with other editors (the Bold, Revert, Discuss cycle), then you might be ready to read your first article carefully, and try creating a draft. If you don't follow this advice but try to create an article without this preparation, you are likely to have a frustrating and disappointing experience with Wikipedia.

Thank you, @ColinFine, for your warm welcome and detailed feedback. I really appreciate your guidance and advice for new editors.
Regarding sources: I understand the importance of the Golden Rule (WP:GNG) and have revised the draft (Draft:Sam Bayat Makoo) to remove non-independent sources (e.g., Gulf News, Caribbean News Global, IMI Daily) that appeared promotional or linked to Mr. Bayat‚Äôs firm. The current sources are:
- *The Corporate Immigration Review* (Law Business Research), a reputable legal publication covering his contributions.
- *Le Barreau du Qu√©bec*‚Äôs directory, an independent verification of his attorney status.
- *Mona Shah & Partners Podcast*, an independent interview with analytical coverage of his work.
I‚Äôm actively searching for more independent sources to establish notability and will ensure only uncontroversial facts from non-independent sources are used sparingly, if at all. Regarding conflict of interest (WP:COI), I confirm I have no personal, professional, or financial connection with Mr. Bayat or Bayat Group. My interest stems from researching notable figures in immigration law and historical contexts (e.g., his background related to the Bayat tribe), but I‚Äôm only using independent sources for the draft.
I take your advice about learning Wikipedia‚Äôs policies seriously and have been studying WP:V, WP:NPOV, WP:RS, and WP:NBIO, as well as consulting tools (including AI for policy clarification, not content creation) to avoid missteps due to English being my second language. I used Grammarly for grammar corrections and AI for translating some ideas from Persian to English for clarity. I‚Äôll continue improving existing articles to gain experience, as you suggested, while refining this draft.
Could you please let me know if the revised sources seem sufficient or if specific improvements are still needed? Thank you again for your help! InsightAdventurer (talk) 16:48, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Moving redirects[edit]
I plan on moving the redirect Scarlet red from Sudan IV to Scarlet (color). Is that okay. It's fine if it's not. Cheeky91021 (talk) 21:44, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Cheeky91021 I think that the current redirect is owing to "scarlet red" being a synonym of the chemical, as listed in its entry in ChemSpider. Anyone typing "scarlet" in the search bar is going to be offered the DAB page and Scarlet (color) as some of the options. Only by continuing to type the whole "scarlet red" will they get the dye, so I think the present situation is fine. Mike Turnbull (talk) 22:00, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Perhaps you could create a disambiguation page for it? I would discuss your rationale for creating it in the new disambig page's talk page for other editors to see. Commandant Quacks-a-lot (talk) 22:34, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Help on Article[edit]
Hello all, I have written an article about a singer (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft:Deepak_Bajracharya) from Nepal. But my submission was declined thrice with the comment "the formal tone expected of an encyclopedia article". I need help to locate the actual issue in the article. Nirjal stha (talk) 04:33, 20 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
When formal tone is the issue, then the problem is the entire article. Formal tone means use a completely different style of language. To write like a textbook, not like a magazine.
Is that helpful, or did I only make it worse? TooManyFingers (talk) 04:43, 20 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Thank you for the response. I have tried my best to write in a formal tone and maintain a neutral point of view, but the reviewer‚Äôs comments seem unchanged from the second review. Therefore, I need external help with specific comments in the article, because the comment ‚Äòthe formal tone expected of an encyclopedia article‚Äô on the fourth review seems too vague to guide the necessary improvements. Nirjal stha (talk) 04:54, 20 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I think part of the problem is that some of your references are poor. For example, under "Social work", you give a reference to the singer's own website advertising himself. That is no good - probably the entire "Social work" section needs to be deleted unless you find reliable references.
I don't want to presume too much, but from that bad reference I get the impression that you might be trying to get an article pushed through without really understanding what's required. Or you understand what's required but believe it shouldn't apply in your case.
It does apply, 100%. You need to understand all the details in all the requirements that people have already shown you. TooManyFingers (talk) 05:19, 20 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Thank you for the detail review and pointed out the issue, which the reviewers want to highlight. This really helpful because after reading the article more than couple of times, content seems family in every aspect and it is very hard to identify the area where we need to improve. Nirjal stha (talk) 05:28, 20 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
In such cases, often someone becomes irritated because they want to say "I told you before, why didn't you listen?" - but they might feel like it's rude to say that. TooManyFingers (talk) 05:44, 20 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Please note that I stopped reading after I found one problem. There might be other problems that I ignored after finding one obvious one. It's your job to see if there are more. TooManyFingers (talk) 05:47, 20 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Thanks for helping me out. Sure, i will check the whole article again from a fresh perspective. Nirjal stha (talk) 06:04, 20 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Need help. Nirjal stha (talk) 05:04, 20 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Nirjal stha, "The Rhythm Band" section is unreferenced and therefore fails Verifiability, which is a core content policy. The sentence In 2011, he was associated with the Cancer Relief Society in the United States of America to promote Nepal Tourism is also unreferenced and has the same problem. I raised money for years for the American Cancer Society and have never heard of the "Cancer Relief Society" in the United States. I am not saying that such an organization does not exist but I doubt that it is important enough to mention in an encyclopedia's biography of a living person, especially without a reference to a reliable, independent source. Without a reference, it comes off as promotional and the word "promote" is in the sentence. I could go on, but it is your obligation to ensure that your draft meets all the requirements for a biography of a living person. Cullen328 (talk) 06:05, 20 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Thank you for pointing out the issue. I will add verifiable reference for that part. Nirjal stha (talk) 06:16, 20 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Hello, @Stefan85xx. That is the purpose of review. We don't normally do pre-reviews. ColinFine (talk) 10:43, 20 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I see ColinFine's comment that we don't normally do pre-reviews, but I just had a look, and to me the whole article still looks very much like advertising. The problem (as I see it) is not style, but content. The whole article is set up to show what this company can offer me if I do business with them, and how I can become their customer ‚Äì most or all of that needs to be deleted. A Wikipedia article shows mainly (taking almost all of the words in the article) how the company has been seen in the past by the general public who are not doing business with them. We want to merely collect and show the information that any member of the general public could already find in the public library and the news. We don't want any information that wasn't already communicated to the public by reliable sources unrelated to the company (or only a little of that).

Draft Article Declined[edit]
Hi! I've recently been working on my first article and am having trouble getting it accepted. The article is about a film writer, director, and producer who is highly cited across the internet and in entertainment media news and is the winner of several industry awards, yet doesn't seem to have a page. (The name of this filmmaker is Ari Katcher.) He's show running the new adaptation of Jennette McCurdy's memoir I'm Glad My Mom Died for Apple TV+ starring Jennifer Aniston, so I believe he will continue to pick up notoriety as the series progresses and it would be great to start a Wikipedia profile. My draft article has been declined twice now for the same reasoning of "notability / not enough reliable, independent secondary sources cited."
The first time I submitted, the majority of my citations about his work credits were pulled from IMDb, which I understand is an editable cite, so maybe not recognized as an independent source. However, in preparation for my resubmission, I added several articles from various reputable entertainment news outlets, including Deadline, Hollywood Reporter, Variety, and Vanity Fair, as well as the official sites of the organizations that granted Ari his several industry awards. My resubmission was still declined for the same reasoning though. I'm wondering if anyone could take a look at the page and let me know if there is something different I should be including to help this page be accepted?

Moving draft[edit]
Hi everyone!
I've submitted a draft biography for AfC review at User:Bahuman/AnilBahuman following Wikipedia's COI guidelines (I've disclosed my conflict of interest on the talk page and am seeking independent editorial review).
The draft has a warning saying it should be moved to Draft:AnilBahuman, but when I try to move it, automated filters prevent me from doing so due to autobiography detection.
Could an experienced editor help with moving it to the proper Draft: namespace? I've followed the AfC submission process correctly and just need help with this technical step.

Birth date sourcing[edit]
On the page for Carlos Fernandes (activist) I want to include the Facebook funeral announcement from the NGO he was a founder of, Iris Angola, as a source his date of birth.
For context, other news outlets do not provide his birth date. Some say he was 41, but according the funeral announcement from Iris Angola, he was 40 at the time of his passing. Considering this is the only source that gives a date of birth at all, and considering it would be odd for the organization he founded to get his birthday wrong, I think it should be used for date of birth.
However, it is a self-published source (a Facebook post) which typically isn't allowed. I verified the Facebook account is legitimate and does belong to the real Iris Angola since another news source, the Bay Area Reporter, linked to it saying it was Iris.
Is this use of a self published source allowed given the circumstances? Thanks.¬†Urchincrawler (talk) 01:25, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
That seems reasonable. Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 10:45, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Hi and welcome to Wikipedia! Articles for Creation can take a while. There's no specific order in which submissions are reviewed. However, I did take a quick look at your article, and I think you should add more references. Because you are writing about a living person, it is really important that all the details you include have references to reliable sources. For example, in the Early life section, I would want to see:
A source for her birthplace
A source that talks about her early years (or cut that section)
A source for her participation at Toru≈Ñski Klub Karate Shotokan
A source for her university degree
The sources that you've cited at the bottom of the article might include those details. I don't read Polish, so I'm not sure. But it's important that you cite a source for the fact right after the sentence, not just later in the article (so the source is still there if other parts of the article are edited).
If you got the facts from somewhere else--like an unreliable source, AI, or from knowing the subject personally--then they don't belong in the article, and should be removed.
I hope is helpful feedback! SomeoneDreaming (talk) 01:47, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

What have they been saying is wrong with it? TooManyFingers (talk) 02:10, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Thanks for the quick reply...This submission's references do not show that the subject qualifies for a Wikipedia article‚Äîthat is, they do not show significant coverage (not just passing mentions) about the subject in published, reliable, secondary sources that are independent of the subject (see the guidelines on the notability of people). Before any resubmission, additional references meeting these criteria should be added (see technical help and learn about mistakes to avoid when addressing this issue). If no additional references exist, the subject is not suitable for Wikipedia. Mesomay (talk) 02:15, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I see. Unfortunately, the only way to fix this problem is to find those references they talked about. It means that so far, the article's references are the wrong kind. Does that make sense? TooManyFingers (talk) 02:52, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Everybody knows that Wikipedia must have an article about Einstein, one of the most important figures in 20th-century science.
Everybody knows that Wikipedia must NOT have an article about me, because I am not important to the rest of the world, only to me and a few people who know me.
Almost every person is in between: they are more notable than me, but less notable than Einstein. To have an article about them, we have to prove they are notable. (It's easy to prove Einstein is notable, and impossible to prove I am notable.) TooManyFingers (talk) 03:01, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Thank you so much for your response. I think I understand what you are saying. My subject is definitely notable in New Zealand, which is evidenced by the number of awards she has won in business and fashion. I can find examples of other New Zealanders with less notoriety and they have used media sources aswell. Are you able to access the draft? Mesomay (talk) 04:57, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Awards don't help unless the awards themselves are notable awards. (On a different topic, think of those "car of the year" awards that the carmakers always give to each other and that nobody follows.) Published material (independent sources choosing to write articles about her work without interviewing her, for example) is worth a lot more.

This is about Draft:Annah Stretton 2 (started by Mesomay); not to be confused with Draft:Annah Stretton (about the same person, and started by RKLET). "Media source" is a term that covers anything from scrupulously compiled material read for enlightenment and/or pleasure (and for which one would willingly pay money) all the way down to uncritically recycled PR bumf. There is no simple relationship between (A) degree of fame (or "notoriety") and (B) notability (as understood here). -- Hoary (talk) 07:38, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

@My planet is Homlos welcome to Teashouse! you're trying to do the right thing and I want to reassure you: you are not going to get banned just for making good-faith mistakes everyone here started as a new editor and learning the rules can be confusing at first. I'm not sure why you try to put {{Vandalism}} temp on you userpage the template is not meant for user pages that's why Wikipedia gave you the scary message it doesn‚Äôt mean you are vandalizing it‚Äôs just the template's purpose. If you want to link to vandalism use double square brackets like this: [[Vandalism]]... And also Sometimes other editors may remove or question edits if they aren't clearly sourced don't match the style guidelines or look like opinion or speculation... That doesn't mean you're being accused of bad intent. Wikipedia has a strict policy about verifiability (see WP:V) so even good edits can get reverted if the sourcing isn‚Äôt crystal clear...
About your user page: You're absolutely allowed to have a personal page (within user page guidelines) but templates like {{Vandalism}} have special meanings and should not be used there... If you just want to mention the word vandalism typing [[Vandalism]] will make a safe link to the article
Here's the best advice I can give don't be afraid. You're clearly editing in good faith and that's what matters most. If something gets reverted treat it as a chance to learn and feel free to ask the reverting editor politely on their talk page why.

Finding sources for book series[edit]
Hi there, I've been editing for the Nevermoor book series for a while now, with the fourth book in the series being released in April this year. Unfortunately, no page has been created for this fourth book because except for this ABC article, I haven't been able to find anything that qualifies the book as even mildly notable. A few reviews, sure, but they're not from reliable/notable sources and mostly talk about the author's 4 year hiatus and not the contents of the book itself. So - any advice? Is it still too soon? And if it is, should I make a draft of the book's topic and themes etc or hold off until notability can be proven? Thanks!¬†:)
Cornonthehunt (talk) 04:23, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I think it might be a bit too soon for a standalone article tho
since there isn‚Äôt much independent coverage yet (see WP:NBOOK) but for now you could add sourced info about the fourth book to the main The Nevermoor series article and also I think a draft in your userspace would be better until stronger coverage appears.¬†:) ThilioR O B O Tü§ñ talk 05:04, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hi there! I have no comment on the merits of this particular book or series, so this is a general comment about finding reviews. I have spent some time looking for them myself, and have had solid luck using EBSCOhost and Gale to search for reviews that aren't available through search engines. If you make 500 edits and have an account that is at least 6 months old, you can access these databases, and others, for free through the Wikipedia Library. Depending on your situation, a nearby school/university or public library may also subscribe to database services that could help you find sources.
In my experience, there is no guarantee these reviews will be available on the service even if they're indexed there, and you might still have to do some hunting to find them. But, if you can get an idea of if this particular book probably meets WP:NBOOK or that it probably does not, that could inform your choice about creating a draft of some kind.

Hello Andy.
Rovos Rail is a 'pocket of excellence' when it comes to South African tourism ‚Äì widly regarded as one of the best luxury train experiences globally. However I notice that Rovos Rail focuses on a derailment ‚Äì to some extent overshadowing Rovos‚Äô success and benefits that it brings to regional tourism- in a remarkably challenging Southern African rail environment.
Ceres Rail Company focuses on the restoration of both freight and tourist rail services within the Western Cape province of South Africa to; (1) reduce traffic congestion in Cape Town, caused in part by booming regional tourism and property sectors, and;(2) promote tourism in outlying rural regions of the Western Cape, notably Elgin, South Africa
and Ceres, South Africa, in addition to occasionally Darling, Simon's Town and overnight trips to Mossell Bay. Recently Ceres Rail Company has added Botrivier as a destination which will enhance the tourism appeal of another rural town.
Ceres Rail Company retains skills from former Transnet (State Logics Company) employees to maintain and restore heritage locomotives, such as South African Class 26 4-8-4 and rollingstock including the Union Limited, formerly Blue Train (South Africa) and more recently the restoration of rail infostructure. CRC‚Äôs other primary focus is enabling the migration of road freight to rail from Ceres, the leading fruit growing region of South Africa, to the Port of Cape Town. Unfortunately the Michell's Pass branch line was severely damaged during floods in June 2023. CRC is now endeavoring to restorage the railway through the pass at its own cost in order to restore the freight and tourism rail services between Cape Town and Ceres.
The restoration of freight rail services provides significant benefits to the region, including reduced damage to provincial roads, reduced logistics costs for exports, reduced truck induced road accidents and reduced congestion in the City of Cape Town. In the context of the incident you mention, as you have pointed out, the experienced locomotive crew was able to brake hard to avoid the train heading into parked rail wagons, which unfortunately caused some passengers to be thrown forward. Fortunately, the incident was not severe to an extent that it required the involvement of the company‚Äôs Public Liability Insurance provider. However in an ideal world the incident mentioned shouldn‚Äôt overshadow the mission of restoring rail operations in the Western Cape.
The reasons why I‚Äôm looking into Wikipedia in the context of Ceres Rail Company are¬†;(1) numerous Wikipedia search results make references to Ceres Rail Company, without it obviously having a Wikipedia page and (2) AI generated search results contain a surprising amount of misinformation or Hallucination (artificial intelligence) I figured that a dedicated Wikipedia page could help remedy the above.
Apologies for not being able to keep my response to a few lines.
Kind Regards

I hope you know that the vast majority of what you just wrote here is never going to be accepted in an article. If you try, it will be cut out very quickly. TooManyFingers (talk) 20:09, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The point is Simon Le May Beckett, that appeals to other editors to write an article for you (for whatever reason) don't often work, because everybody here is a volunteer that chooses what they spend their time on. If you are lucky enough to catch somebody's interest, so they want to work on it: great; but that doesn't often happen.
So most of the time, if you want an article writing, the most likely way to make that happen is to do it yourself. The articles for creation process is designed for (among other things) people with a COI to create articles even with their COI.
Having said that, creating an article is the most difficult and challenging task for new editors. My earnest advice to new editors is to not even think about
trying to create an article until you have spent several weeks - at least - learning about how Wikipedia works by making improvements to existing articles. Once you have understood core policies such as verifiability, neutral point of view, reliable, independent sources, and notability, and experienced how we handle disagreements with other editors (the Bold, Revert, Discuss cycle), then you might be ready to read your first article carefully, and try creating a draft. If you don't follow this advice but try to create an article without this preparation, you are likely to have a frustrating and disappointing experience with Wikipedia. And that's even without a COI.
It's possible that you will find somebody interested in working with you on this at WikiProject Trains; but don't hold your breath. --ColinFine (talk) 19:18, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
File upload difficulty[edit]
Can someone help me proceed with a file upload (Eli Jaxon-Bear)? I can't get it published after the upload. Sapotilex (talk) 10:37, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
You would need to tell us more about which file you are trying to upload, and what happens when you try to upload it. Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 10:44, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
You have successfully uploaded File:Eli Jaxon-Bear.pdf, Sapotilex. Do you expect that volunteers will transform this into a draft (adding markup where appropriate), and thence into an article? That's most unlikely to happen. Instead, somebody believing that a given subject merits an article checks that the subject is notable as defined by and for Wikipedia and if so then performs these chores themself, posts the result as a draft, and submits the draft as a candidate for promotion to full article status. -- Hoary (talk) 10:52, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Thanks. I have contested the nomination for "speedy deletion" and request some time granted so a volunteer can complete the necessary chores. The article contains ample references. Sapotilex (talk) 11:09, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Sapotilex, PDF files are normally created from other files. If this is created from a UTF8 text file, then you can copy this text file into your "sandbox" and work on it there. If it's instead created from a file in some other format (e.g. ODT), then you can export that to a UTF8 text file and again copy this into your "sandbox" and work on it there. The volunteer you speak of will almost certainly be you. -- Hoary (talk) 11:17, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Thanks--the .pdf is from a Word file. I'm working with a Mac. Will TIFF be acceptable? Sapotilex (talk) 11:24, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
No. How do you expect any editor to work with the text in an image? Cabayi (talk) 11:27, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
No it wouldn't. I'm sure that MS Word can export from DOCX (or DOC, or ODT) to plain text. So get it to do that. Copy the result and paste it into either your sandbox or Draft:Eli Jaxon-Bear. And then start the conversion to Mediawiki markup. But I advise you to read and digest H:YFA before you start. -- Hoary (talk) 11:36, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I've submitted a new draft as plain text and it's in my sandbox, but now it says no such file exists. Sapotilex (talk) 13:29, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Sapotilex Your work is at Draft:Eli Jaxon-Bear and is not yet submitted for review. You can look at the WP:AFCREVIEW to see how to do that but first you will need to convert the whole draft to use wikimarkup, with the references done correctly: see Help:Referencing for beginners. Mike Turnbull (talk) 15:17, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Mike Turnbull writes that "you will need to convert the whole draft", Sapotilex. I disagree. Much of the draft doesn't merit such conversion. As one example among many, here are what I imagine are intended as a pair: In 1978, Kalu Rinpoche appointed Jaxon-Bear president of Kagyu Minjur Choling, a Kagyu Tibetan Buddhist dharma center in Marin County, California.[12] and [12] Jaxon-Bear, Eli. An Outlaw Makes It Home: The Awakening of a Spiritual Revolutionary. New Morning Books, 2018, pp. 222-225. So this boils down to "EJB was so appointed, and we know this for a fact because he says so". (Moreover, he appears to be not only the writer but also the publisher of the book.) Articles can't be based on the say-so of their subjects. Which reliable source, independent of EJB, says that EJB was so appointed? Cite that. If you can't find such a source, don't mention the appointment. -- Hoary (talk) 21:53, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Thank you. I hope the draft can at least stay in place without deletion while I rework it. Is that doable? I need more time. Sapotilex (talk) 22:14, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Sapotilex, drafts may be deleted if they haven't been touched in six months. In the meantime, please read Referencing for beginners. ClaudineChionh (she/her ¬∑ talk ¬∑ email ¬∑ global) 22:57, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Drafts can be summarily deleted for any of a number of reasons (e.g. copyright violation). But inadequate referencing isn't one of these. So you are free to work on the draft. However, before you invest more time in it, I suggest that you read WP:PERSON and consider whether the resulting draft will demonstrate that EJB is "notable" (as the word is defined here). If it won't, then promotion to article status will be impossible. -- Hoary (talk) 23:59, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

non-digital clipping as a reference[edit]
How can I use a newspaper clipping as a source when the newspaper (club magazine, neighborhood bulletin) doesn't have a digital archive? Ultimately, my clipping is the only source availlable until any papertigers come up with additions later (or never). Yet, the clippings contain useful information. Robbert Ritmeester (talk) 11:59, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Robbert Ritmeester You can use the template TM:Cite news normally, even without a URL. Just input any information you have, like the article title, newspaper, page number, author, and date. WP:OFFLINE explains why this is okay. Toadspike [Talk] 12:09, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
This is true, while keeping in mind that the requirements for reliability of sources still apply. If the paper that the clippings come from is reliable enough for what it's being used for, then it doesn't matter what format it was originally published in. But if it was a newsletter published in the subject's friend's basement, it's still not going to count. TooManyFingers (talk) 12:32, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
How would that work out for these examples:
Newspaper: De Noord Amsterdammer
Date: Wednsesday 28 november1990
and
Title: De Zonnewijzer
Subtitle: wijkkrant voor Tuindorp Oostzaan (translate = local newspaper for this village T.O.)
Date: December 17 1990
Year: 15
Number: no.7 Robbert Ritmeester (talk) 14:03, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
That's probably okay. As a local newspaper, this probably isn't the most reliable of sources, but should be fine for non-exceptional details. Seems it was affiliated with a football clu, [4] so it may not qualify as independent of that club. Toadspike [Talk] 14:11, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
sources such as TV or podcast interviews[edit]
I'm writing an entry about a singer. His current band has a Wikipedia entry. Some of the information, such as the fact he has ADHD, is taken from radio, podcast and national TV interviews. Seeing that this is a singer, can I cite those interviews,and if so,how? ◊™◊û◊ô ◊†◊ô◊†◊ô◊ï (talk) 14:23, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
You can cite interviews, but note that if he is the one saying it, rather than an interviewer, it's a primary source and a non-independent one. Just don't base the whole article off things he says. Interviews mostly don't contribute to notability, but they are fine as sources. As for how to cite them -- I like to use the dedicated citation templates, like {{Cite podcast}}, etc. Mrfoogles (talk) 14:47, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Things that interviewers say in interviews are often things they would not say if the subject wasn't there. There isn't a strong division like "subject=unreliable and interviewer=reliable"; interviews are overall less reliable no matter who is speaking. (It depends on the situation though.) TooManyFingers (talk) 19:47, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hello, @◊™◊û◊ô ◊†◊ô◊†◊ô◊ï, and welcome to the Teahouse.
The first and most importnt thing you need to do in writing a new article is to show that you have enough sources, each of which meets all the criteria in the golden rule, to establish that the subject meets Wikipedia's criteria for notability. If you cannot find such sources, then you will not be able to write an acceptable article, and should spend no further time trying.
Note that notability is not inherited: just because there is enough published about his band to base an article on, does not guarantee that there is enough published about him to do so. ColinFine (talk) 19:25, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Reusing citations[edit]
If a citation/reference I used supports more than one fact in an entry, e.g., it states both a person's place of residence and their pet's names,can I use it as a reference for both facts? If so, how do I do that? ◊™◊û◊ô ◊†◊ô◊†◊ô◊ï (talk) 14:44, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Yes. If you're using the source editor, write <ref name="foo">Citation details here</ref> the first time and then <ref name="foo"/> the second time. If you're using the visual editor, just click the reference, control-C, and then control-V wherever you want to reuse it. Mrfoogles (talk) 14:48, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Question(s) about rules[edit]
Hey there, I have a question and I really hope I‚Äôm in the right place here to ask. (All the different places appear to suggest I should go to a place)
My question is a bit double. I want to know if there is a place on Wikipedia where I can find someone to answer a question about the rules/policies of Wikipedia, because I am not sure if what I am doing is allowed or not.
Someone suggested I ask an Admin, but
I don‚Äôt want to bother them.
I don‚Äôt know any
it might need to (or specifically not?) be an admin related to a specific topic because it is about rules from the arbitration committee.
So I wanted to come here first to ask if and what‚Äôs the right place to ask a question like this. (About rules) AND if it turns out that this place (teahouse) is also the right place for this, I‚Äôd like to follow up with asking the actual question about rules here, linking to the conversation where my confusion lead to the question(s).
Thanks in advance. Slomo666 (talk) 15:38, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Yes, you may pose your questions here. 331dot (talk) 15:40, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
That‚Äôs great.
So basically my questions are roughly contained in this message on my talk page.
although even before I would ask those, I might already be helped greatly if someone could direct me to a very detailed explanation of how the rules from ARBPIA work. (If I can read that, maybe I can figure it out myself. The thing linked by the person I was talking to, did not really answer my questions)

ARBPIA rules + Extended confirmed, hope these links are of some help. Butterscotch Beluga (talk) 17:28, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Not really tbh. I‚Äôve read these already and they don‚Äôt reassure me if I am or am not allowed to edit on P/I issues/pages. The issue is mostly that another editor warned me this was not allowed because I don‚Äôt have 500 edits in the mainspace (see the link above, which is a comment replying to that editor) despite having been granted extended confirmed status.
The point that editor brought up was basically accusing me of ‚Äúgaming‚Äù because the plurality of my edits are on talk pages. Slomo666 (talk) 17:56, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Slomo666, the other editor's concerns seemed to be about you gaming the system, which is manipulating the rules to gain an advantage or an advanced permission. Despite a comment by that other editor on your user talk page, there is no requirement that the 500 edits for extended confirmed status be to article space. On the other hand, it is required that the edits be useful and productive, and not phony "make work" edits. While talk page edits can certainly be constructive, not every such edit actually is. On your talk page, you commented I have a lot of talk page edits because I tend to get into very long (sometimes pointless) conversations. In response to that, my two pieces of advice to you are to be succinct and to avoid pointless conversations. For example, asking a question about whether you are allowed to ask a question at the Teahouse is a bit bizarre. The ARBPIA topic area is one where tempers are often frayed and some editors may be looking for evidence of misconduct. Do not behave in a manner that is highly likely to irritate other editors. That never ends well in the ARBPIA world. Cullen328 (talk) 18:02, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Hello, @Cecio208, and welcome to the Teahouse.
If the original article has citations which are satisfactory and adequate for the criteria in English Wikipedia (see WP:42), then simply translating the article may be enough. But if the sources are not adequate (which is often the case for articles in other-language Wikipedia, since English Wikipedia's criteria are stricter than most), then translating the existing article is mostly a waste of time, and the only productive approach is to treat it as a new article in English, and start by finding suitable sources. See WP:YFA. ColinFine (talk) 20:04, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

TeenX808, there is way more content about your topic in the second book that can be paraphrased and added. Personally, I would use a different word than "plastered" since it is imprecise and has multiple meanings in English. I am unfamiliar with the historicity of accounts of events in Sri Lanka 2000 years ago, but I would be cautious about describing things that may have legendary components as being true in Wikipedia's voice.

TeenX808, I think that "applied" is a good alternative. Others might be "coated" or "overlaid". Cullen328 (talk) 18:59, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

TeenX808, the following sentence is confusing and so it needs to be rewritten. Also "Roman" is capitalized.

But taking a look this page [5] you can see for instance, the Atlantic Ocean is being linked in 22,335 articles. So am I missing something? In what circumstances can it be linked? WhatADrag07 (talk) 21:54, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Links are usually used for things that many readers are likely to look for more information about. They don't normally look for more information about things they consider obvious.
It's always important that they can read the article properly without following any of your links, too; for anything where the average person is unlikely to even know what it is, you have to give a basic explanation right there in your article, even though you linked it - not force them to click just to understand what you're talking about.

Moving a disambiguation page[edit]
To me, it seems undeniable that Clix (gamer) is the primary topic for Clix. I would like to make the following moves:
Clix ‚Üí Clix (disambiguation)
Clix (gamer) ‚Üí Clix
Please let me know if this is adequate. If yes, I'd like to know if there's anything to watch out for when making these moves. Rockfighterz M (talk) 22:05, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Rockfighterz M the first step would be to ask this question on the talk pages for those two articles, where they are more likely to be seen by interested editors. ClaudineChionh (she/her ¬∑ talk ¬∑ email ¬∑ global) 23:03, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
(edit conflict) Some users will never have heard of the the gamer, and be familiar with the Unix version, or whatever. You need to discuss this before making a move. I suggest you start a discussion at Talk:Clix, and post invitations to participate on the talk pages of the other "Clix" articles. Maproom (talk) 23:13, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
WP:RSPM lays out the process. DMacks (talk) 00:38, 22 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
