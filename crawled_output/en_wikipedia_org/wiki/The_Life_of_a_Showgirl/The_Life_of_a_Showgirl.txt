"The Fate of Ophelia"Released: TBA[1]
The Life of a Showgirl is the upcoming twelfth studio album by the American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. It is scheduled for release on October 3, 2025, via Republic Records. Swift created the album during the European leg of the Eras Tour in 2024, inspired by her life as an entertainer.
Swift wrote and produced The Life of a Showgirl with the producers Max Martin and Shellback in Sweden, working with the duo for the first time since Reputation (2017). Swift described the album as a vibrant and lively project, departing from the bleak lyricism of its predecessor, The Tortured Poets Department (2024). It contains 12 songs, including the lead single "The Fate of Ophelia". American singer Sabrina Carpenter is featured on the title track.
Photographed by Mert and Marcus, Swift adopted a provocative, showgirl-inspired theme for the album; journalists described it as the most glamorous and flamboyant visual aesthetic of her career. She announced the album on New Heights, a sports podcast hosted by her fiancé Travis Kelce and his brother Jason, on August 13, 2025. The corresponding episode became the most-watched podcast premiere in history. An album launch event and film, titled The Official Release Party of a Showgirl, will be shown in cinema theatres from October 3 to 5.
Background[edit]
On April 19, 2024, Taylor Swift released her eleventh studio album, The Tortured Poets Department.[2] Conceived amidst Swift's heightened fame and publicized personal life during her 2023 run of the Eras Tour, The Tortured Poets Department became the global best-selling album of 2024.[3][4] The album was met with a positive reception from music critics,[5] but criticism targeted its length and perceived verbosity.[a] She included songs from the album in a revamped set list for the European and final North American legs of the Eras Tour, running from May to December 2024.[9][10]
In April 2025, Universal Music Sweden reported in a now-deleted post that Swedish violinist Erik Arvinder was involved in the production of Swift's upcoming music.[11][12] On July 15, Hits magazine reported "seismic rumblings of a new Taylor [Swift album]" before removing the claim hours later.[13] Swift teased The Life of a Showgirl with various Easter eggs, with publications noting the specific outfit choices, social media posts, numbers, visuals, and performances spanning the promotional cycles of Midnights (2022) and The Tortured Poets Department, as well as the Eras Tour.[14][15]
Writing and production[edit]
Swift produced The Life of a Showgirl alongside Swedish producers Max Martin and Shellback, both of whom previously worked with Swift on her albums Red (2012), 1989 (2014), and Reputation (2017).[16] She stated the collaboration began after she spoke to Martin in May 2024 while the Eras Tour was playing in Stockholm.[17] She then traveled to Sweden in between tour dates on the European leg in the following months to record the album.[18] Swift said that the album reflected the "exuberant and electric and vibrant" energy that she felt during and behind-the-scenes of the tour, recalling it as "the most infectiously joyful, wild, dramatic place" of her life.[19]
The track listing includes 12 songs with no bonus track, which is different from Swift's past albums. She explained that it was because she wanted to focus "on quality and on the theme and everything fitting together like a perfect puzzle".[20] She also stated that creating "infectious" melodies was one of her goals with the album, in contrast to its lyrically heavy predecessor.[21][a]
Songs[edit]
The second track of The Life of a Showgirl is titled after the English-American actress Elizabeth Taylor (left). Sabrina Carpenter (right) is a guest feature on the album's title track.
The opening track, "The Fate of Ophelia", references the death of Ophelia, the lead female character of William Shakespeare's play Hamlet. The second track, "Elizabeth Taylor", is titled after the English-American actress. The closing title track, "The Life of a Showgirl", features the American singer Sabrina Carpenter, one of the opening acts of the Eras Tour.[22]
Marketing[edit]
Promotion[edit]
On August 11, 2025, the weekly sports podcast New Heights—hosted by Swift's fiancé and Kansas City Chiefs player Travis Kelce and his brother Jason—posted a thumbnail promoting their next episode, featuring a silhouette of Swift.[23][24] Swift's marketing team, Taylor Nation, shared 12 pictures of Swift in orange-colored outfits from the Eras Tour, with the caption "Thinking about when she said, 'See you next era'", referencing the last sentence in The Eras Tour Book.[2][23][25] A countdown with an orange background appeared on Swift's website, ending at 12:12 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time (UTC−04:00) on August 12.[26][27] Shortly after, New Heights released a snippet from the episode, revealing Swift as their special guest.[27][28] When the countdown ended, Swift's website briefly crashed before revealing the title of her twelfth studio album to be The Life of a Showgirl,[26][27] and featured a pre-order interface for the physical album (vinyl LP, cassette tape, and CD).[29]
A Spotify playlist curated by Swift, titled "And, baby, that's show business for you", was promoted through billboards in New York City and Nashville, Tennessee. The playlist contained all 22 songs from her discography that were produced by Martin and Shellback.[2][30] Google Searches for "Taylor Swift" displayed orange confetti, a flaming heart emoji, and the previously revealed Spotify playlist title.[31]
A second New Heights teaser showed Swift confirming the album's title while displaying a blurred version of the cover artwork.[27][29] During the podcast, Swift revealed the album's cover artwork, track listing, collaborators, theme, and the release date of October 3.[32] Four limited edition CD variants, each with its own cover and color scheme, were made available for pre-order.[b] From August 18 through 25, Swift also made three limited-edition vinyl LPs available for pre-order.[c]
On September 7, 2025, Target Corporation announced that about 500 of its stores will be open at midnight on October 3 to sell the album, including three exclusive CD editions.[36] On September 17, the BBC announced that Swift will feature on the October 3 episode of The Graham Norton Show.[37]
Film[edit]
On September 19, 2025, Swift announced a "film event" titled Taylor Swift: The Official Release Party of a Showgirl. Publications have described it as an album release party,[38] a special program,[39] and a movie-musical event.[40] It is a limited theatrical release
in over 100 countries:[40][41] from October 3 to 5 in eighteen territories,[d] and on later dates elsewhere.[42][43] The film consists of multiple elements, including the music video for the lead single "The Fate of Ophelia", behind-the-scenes footage of the video, lyric videos of the album's tracks, and Swift's commentary on the songs. The total runtime is 89 minutes.[41]
Akin to her 2023 concert film Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour, Swift partnered with cinema theaters for the film distribution of The Official Release Part of a Showgirl, bypassing major studios. In the United States, the film is scheduled to play in all 540 AMC Theaters locations as well as Cinemark Theaters and Regal Cinemas.[44][45] Variance Films and Piece of Magic Entertainment are handling ticket bookings, the former for the US and Canada, and the latter overseas.[43][46]
Deadline Hollywood reported on September 21 that the film collected US$15,000,000 in pre-sales in its first 24 hours across all circuits.[43] The British comedy film Grow moved its U.S. release date from October 3 to October 17, to avoid competition.[47]
Artwork and aesthetic[edit]
The standard cover is considered a reference to Ophelia (left), a Hamlet-inspired painting by John Everett Millais. Some of the album's artworks feature Bob Mackie's costumes from Jubilee! (right).
Promotional visuals for The Life of a Showgirl have a glittery, orange-themed color scheme; Swift described the shade as "Portofino Orange Glitter".[48][49] Photographs for the showgirl-inspired material were shot by the fashion photography duo Mert and Marcus, who had previously worked with Swift on Reputation.[50] The standard cover artwork depicts Swift half-submerged in water while wearing a bralette adorned with lines of diamonds covering her torso, customized by AREA.[51] Parts of the cover fragment Swift's body into pieces resembling shattered glass,[51] and the title The Life of a Showgirl is written in orange glitter.[52] Swift stated that the cover was intended to glamorize the offstage aspects of the Eras Tour, stating that each show "ends with [her] in a bathtub."[53]
Several journalists interpreted the standard cover as a reference to John Everett Millais's Hamlet-inspired painting Ophelia.[51][54][55] Prestige Hong Kong's Surabhi Redkar wrote that "while Ophelia's eyes are left lifeless following her drowning, Swift gazes directly at you from the cover, suggesting that she isn't one to suffer and drown under the norms of patriarchy that once killed Ophelia."[54] Harper's Bazaar's Joel Calfee likened the cover to a scene in the music video for Swift's song "Look What You Made Me Do" (2017), where she sits in a bathtub full of jewels.[56] Aishwary Kosla of The Indian Express distinguished that Swift "wears sequins, diamonds and a defiant gaze" in the cover instead of the painting's "tragic maiden drifting toward death".[57]
Swift also wore customized outfits from the fashion brand The Blonds for the album photoshoot, accessorized with sandals designed by Rene Caovilla and jewelery by Lorraine Schwartz.[58] A rhinestone-encrusted bra and thong set worn by Swift for the photoshoot, complete with a headpiece, feathered armbands, and hip accessories, was originally designed by Bob Mackie for the finale of Donn Arden's longest-running revue at the Las Vegas Strip, Jubilee! (1981–2016).[59][60] The cover of the Baby, That's Show Business edition features Swift in the Jubilee! costume with a yellow headpiece and a choker necklace adorned with three rhinestone pendants, alongside her Eras Tour backup dancers dressed as showgirls.[59][61]
Publications characterized the album's overall aesthetic as depicting the flamboyance, extravagance, and maximalism of showgirls.[e] Calfee deemed it the "most provocative aesthetic" of Swift's career,[56] while The Times's Olivia Petter considered the promotion for The Life of a Showgirl the first time she had intentionally sexualized her public image.[63] Marie Claire's Halie LeSavage described the aesthetic as "sensual and sparkling, and the most revealing Swift has ever dressed in the public eye."[51] Jay Stahl and Nicole Fallert from USA Today wrote that it demonstrated Swift "reclaiming ownership over her body from the public", stating that she "has always known when – and what – to show".[64]
Impact[edit]
Following the album announcement, buildings such as the Empire State Building and Kansas City Union Station were illuminated in orange,[65] and media publications like Women's Wear Daily and National Geographic published stories about the history and influence of showgirls.[66][67] The Life of a Showgirl also inspired various brands, companies, corporations, and franchises to post glittery-orange memes and parodies on their social media accounts.[68][69] The specific color went viral on the Internet; Pinterest reported a 8,276 percent surge in searches of "bold orange glitter".[70]
Journalists opined that Swift blended her personal life with her career through the podcast appearance, benefiting from high engagement in both her and Kelce's respective fields.[71] According to The Hollywood Reporter, the New Heights episode is "one of the most revealing and unguarded interviews" of Swift's entire career, foregoing traditional promotional strategies such as magazines and mainstream television.[72] The release date was decoded as 10/3, which adds up to 13, Swift's favorite number,[73] while some publications highlighted that it is unofficially observed as National Boyfriend Day.[f] Swift also specified that the date coincided with Kelce's birthday weekend.[76]
With over 1.3 million live viewers, the New Heights episode set the Guinness World Record for the most concurrent views for a podcast on YouTube, surpassing the previous record held by US President Donald Trump's appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience.[77][78] It became the most-watched episode of New Heights, accumulating over 10 million views in less than 20 hours.[79] Some publications also believed this announcement was Swift's response to Trump's open criticism about her,[g] after she had endorsed the opposition Democratic candidates for the 2024 United States presidential election.[83] Within one day of its release, the episode became one of the platform's most watched podcasts in the previous 12 months.[84]
According to Spotify, New Heights saw a 3,000 percent increase in new listeners, while its female audience grew by 618 percent.[79][84] On August 31, the album became the most pre-saved album of all time on Spotify, breaking Swift's own record achieved with The Tortured Poets Department.[85]
