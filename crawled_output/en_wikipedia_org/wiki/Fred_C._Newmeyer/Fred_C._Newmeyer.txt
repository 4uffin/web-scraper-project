Fred C. Newmeyer[a] (August 9, 1888 – April 24, 1967) was an American actor, film director and film producer.
Biography[edit]
Newmeyer (at right) with Harold Lloyd in the 1919 short film Captain Kidd's Kids
A native of Central City, Colorado, Newmeyer is best known for directing a handful of films in the Our Gang series and for directing several Harold Lloyd movies, eight of them being features. With Sam Taylor, Newmeyer co-directed Lloyd in films including Safety Last! (1923), Girl Shy (1924), and The Freshman (1925). Newmeyer also had an extensive directing and acting resume in other comedy short films. He appeared as an actor in 71 films between 1914 and 1923.
Prior to his film career, Newmeyer played professional baseball.[3][4][5] Partial statistics exist for his time as a left-handed pitcher in Minor League Baseball at the Class D level from 1911 to 1913 in the Southwest Texas League, Michigan State League, and Central Association.[6] He made at least 66 appearances and was the winning pitcher of at least 26 games.[6]
Newmeyer was the original director of the first short in the Our Gang series, also titled Our Gang; his version tested poorly, and producer Hal Roach scrapped most of the footage and remade the short with Robert McGowan as the director. Newmeyer, after directing numerous other shorts at Roach, returned to the Our Gang series in 1936 to direct The Pinch Singer, Arbor Day, Mail and Female and the feature film General Spanky.
Newmeyer and his wife, Berna, had a son, Fred W.[7] After his film career, Newmeyer worked with the athletic department of University High School in Los Angeles.[8] Newmeyer died on April 24, 1967, in Woodland Hills, California,[9] at the age of 78.
