The National Democratic Party (Spanish: Partido Nacional Democrático, abbreviated PND) was a Salvadoran political party that existed from 1918 to 1927. The party held power from 1918 to 1927 in a time period of El Salvador known as the Meléndez–Quiñónez dynasty. El Salvador was called a "coffee republic" during the reign of the PND due to the country's heavy reliance on coffee exports.[1] The party ruled as the country's sole political party.[2]
Its paramilitary wing from 1918 to 1923 was the Red League.[3] President Pío Romero Bosque dissolved the party on 6 September 1927 as a part of his efforts to democratize El Salvador.[4]
