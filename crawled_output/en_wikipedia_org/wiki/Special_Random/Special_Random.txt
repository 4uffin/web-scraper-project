Constituency of the Old Parliament of Scotland
Anstruther Wester in Fife was a royal burgh, created in 1587, that returned one commissioner to the Parliament of Scotland and to the Convention of Estates.
After the Acts of Union 1707, Anstruther Wester, Anstruther Easter, Crail, Kilrenny and Pittenweem formed the Anstruther Easter district of burghs, returning one member between them to the House of Commons of Great Britain.
