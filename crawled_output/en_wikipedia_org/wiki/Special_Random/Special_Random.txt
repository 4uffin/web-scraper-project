Jay Lawrence Gaspar (Korean: 제이엘; born April 21, 2004) is a Filipino singer, dancer, and performer. In 2025, he became one of the winners of the South Korean survival show Universe League and is now a member of the global K-pop boy group AHOF. Back in March 31, 2023, he debuted as
the youngest member of Ppop Boy Group PLUUS.
Life and career[edit]
Early life[edit]
Jay Lawrence Gaspar[1] was born on April 21, 2004 and raised in Muntinlupa, Philippines.[2] He has three siblings and completed his secondary education at Muntinlupa National High School.[1] Prior to his debut, he joined a local dance group, where he gained experience in various dance styles.[2]
2021–2023: Career beginnings and PLUUS[edit]
Main article: Pluus
Gaspar began training under SBTalent Camp in 2019 and was introduced publicly as the thirteenth trainee on September 26, 2021.[3][4] While training under SBTalent Camp, he was mentored by SBTown CEO Geong Seong Han and trainer Adie Hong, both recognized for their involvement in the development of the P-pop group SB19.[5] After four years of training,[2] he was announced on February 8, 2023, as a member of SBTown's first boy group, Pluus.[6] He is the youngest member of the group and has been nicknamed the "Nation's Giant Center".[2] The group officially debuted on March 31, with their first extended play, PLUUS +.Y.M.[3][5]
2024–present: Universe League and AHOF[edit]
Main article: Universe League
In September 2024, during the Pluus In-Motion fan meeting, Gaspar announced that he had successfully auditioned for a K-pop survival program, though the specific show was not disclosed at the time. Then, on October 14, 2024, he was revealed as a contestant on Universe League, a reality competition program produced by SBS, through a concept trailer released on the show's official YouTube channel.[7] The following day, profiles for all 42 contestants were published, including Gaspar.[2] In the early stages of the show, participants were selected by mentors representing three teams: Team Beat, Team Groove, and Team Rhythm. Gaspar was the only contestant drafted by mentors from all three teams and ultimately joined Team Rhythm.[8]
As the competition progressed, he consistently received strong support in global voting.[a] On January 24, 2025, Team Rhythm was named the winning team in the finale, which granted its members the opportunity to debut. As a result, Gaspar was confirmed as a member of the boy group AHOF, managed by F&F Entertainment.[1][11][12] The group officially debuted on July 1, 2025, with the release of their first extended play, Who We Are.[13]
Aside from his group activities, on June 6, Universal Records Philippines released "Alon", which Gaspar recorded in 2024 before auditioning for Universe League.[14][15] Described as a pop ballad, the song centers on themes of transition and letting go. It has been interpreted as a "farewell to his time with PLUUS and a meaningful introduction to his new journey as a member" of AHOF.[16] Within ten days of release, the single surpassed 400,000 streams on Spotify.[17] It was later selected as the theme song for the Tagalog-dubbed broadcast of the Korean drama, Lovely Runner.[18]

Ambassadorships[edit]
In June 2025, Gaspar was appointed as a promotional ambassador for the Korea Dairy Committee’s “I Like It Korea Milk” campaign, aimed at promoting Korean dairy products internationally.[18]
Representation in K-pop[edit]
Gaspar has received attention for incorporating aspects of Filipino culture into his public persona as a K-pop idol.[19] As one of the few Filipino artists active in the South Korean music industry, his inclusion in AHOF has been highlighted as part of a growing trend of increased Southeast Asian representation in K-pop, reflecting the industry's expanding global focus and efforts to engage audiences in regions such as the Philippines, Vietnam, and Indonesia.[20]
He has referenced Filipino internet culture during live broadcasts and televised performances, notably by recreating popular meme gestures such as the "Alden tongue pose", the "AlDub pose", and a pose associated with internet personality Mimiyuuuh. Some of these expressions have also been adopted by fellow AHOF members during livestreams and stage appearances. In addition, Gaspar has expressed his fondness for Filipino food, particularly instant pancit canton noodles and pandesal, and has introduced these to other idols, including fellow AHOF member Steven.[19][21]
Although, he has adapted quickly to life in South Korea and conducts most of his activities in Korean, Gaspar has also used Tagalog during promotional events, particularly in interviews. He has occasionally switched to Filipino in casual interactions, such as backstage moments and airport appearances. These instances have been viewed by fans and commentators as expressions of cultural pride, contributing to his image as a relatable figure among Filipino audiences.[19]
