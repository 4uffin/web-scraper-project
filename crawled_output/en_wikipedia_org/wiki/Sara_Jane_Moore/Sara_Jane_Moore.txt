Sara Jane Moore (née Kahn; February 15, 1930 – September 24, 2025) was an American woman who attempted to assassinate U.S. president Gerald Ford in 1975.[1][2] She was given a life sentence for the attempted assassination, but she was released from prison on December 31, 2007, after serving 32 years. Moore and Lynette "Squeaky" Fromme are the only two women who have attempted to assassinate an American president; both of their assassination attempts were on Gerald Ford and both of them took place in California within three weeks of one another.
Background[edit]
Moore was born in Charleston, West Virginia, the daughter of Ruth (née Moore) and Olaf Kahn.[3] Her paternal grandparents were German immigrants.[4] Moore had been a nursing school student, Women's Army Corps recruit, and accountant. Divorced five times, she had four children before she turned to revolutionary politics in 1975.[5][6] Moore came from a Christian background.[4]
Moore's friends said that she had a fascination and an obsession with Patricia Hearst.[7] After Hearst was kidnapped by the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA), Hearst's father, Randolph Hearst, created the organization People In Need (PIN) to feed the poor, as a response to the SLA's claims that the elder Hearst was "committing 'crimes' against 'the people'".[7] Moore, a volunteer bookkeeper for PIN, had been serving as an FBI informant there until the moment she attempted to assassinate Ford.[5][7][8]
Attempted assassination of Gerald Ford[edit]
Main article: Attempted assassination of Gerald Ford in San Francisco
The reaction right after the assassination attempt
Moore had been evaluated by the Secret Service earlier in 1975, but agents decided that she posed no danger to the president.[9] She had been arrested by police on an illegal-handgun charge the day before the Ford incident, but was released. The police confiscated her .44-caliber Charter Arms Bulldog revolver and 113 rounds of ammunition.[10]
Moore's assassination attempt took place in San Francisco on September 22, 1975, just 17 days after Lynette "Squeaky" Fromme's attempted assassination of Ford. She was standing in the crowd across the street from the St. Francis Hotel, and she was about 40 feet (12 m) away from Ford[11] when she fired a single shot at him with a .38 caliber revolver.[2] She was using a gun which she bought in haste that same morning and as a result, she did not know that the sights were 15 cm (6 inches) off the point-of-impact at that distance, causing her to narrowly miss.[12]
After realizing that she had missed, Moore raised her arm again, and Oliver Sipple, a former Marine, dived toward her and grabbed her arm, possibly saving Ford's life.[13][14] Sipple said at the time: "I saw [her gun] pointed out there and I grabbed for it. [...] I lunged and grabbed the woman's arm and the gun went off."[15] The bullet from the second shot ricocheted and hit John Ludwig, a 42-year-old taxi driver, who survived.[16] U.S. District Judge Samuel Conti, who sentenced Moore, voiced his opinion that Moore would have killed Ford had she had her own gun, and it was only "because her gun was faulty" that the president's life was spared.[12]
During an interview which she conducted in 2009, Moore stated that her motive was to spark a violent revolution in order to bring change to
the United States of America.[17]
Trial and imprisonment[edit]
Moore pled guilty[18] to attempted assassination and was sentenced to life in prison.[19][20] At her sentencing hearing Moore stated: "Am I sorry I tried? Yes and no. Yes, because it accomplished little except to throw away the rest of my life. And, no, I'm not sorry I tried, because at the time it seemed a correct expression of my anger."[21] She served her term at the federal women's prison in Dublin, California, where she worked in the UNICOR prison labor program for $1.25 per hour as the Lead Inmate Operating Accountant.[11][22] Moore had the Federal Bureau of Prisons register number 04851-180.[23]
In 1979, Moore escaped, but she was captured several hours later.[24]
During an interview which he conducted in 2004, Ford described Moore as "off her mind" and he also stated that he continued to make public appearances, even after two attempts on his life within such a short period of time, because "a president has to be aggressive, has to meet the people."[25]
Release and death[edit]
On December 31, 2007, at age 77, Moore was slated to be released from prison on parole after serving 32 years of her life sentence. Ford had died from natural causes on December 26, 2006. Moore had later stated that she regretted the assassination attempt, saying she was "blinded by her radical political views".[26][27] Moore was released under a federal law that makes parole mandatory for inmates who have served at least 30 years of a life sentence and have maintained a satisfactory disciplinary record. When asked about her crime in an interview, Moore stated, "I am very glad I did not succeed. I know now that I was wrong to try."[28]
In February 2019, at age 89, Moore was arrested for violating her parole by failing to tell her parole officer about a trip which she went on outside the country; she was subsequently released in August 2019.[29]
Moore died at a nursing facility in Franklin, Tennessee, on September 24, 2025, at the age of 95. Her death occurred two days after the 50th anniversary of her attempt on Ford's life.[30]
Media[edit]
On May 28, 2019, Moore appeared on NBC's Today program, her first television appearance since she left prison on parole.[31]
Moore also discussed her 1979 escape from prison. She revealed that an inmate told her, "when jumping the fence just put your hand on the barbed wire, you'll only have a few puncture wounds." She went on to say, "If I knew that I was going to be captured several hours later, I would have stopped at the local bar just to get a drink and a burger."[32]
Excerpts from an interview with Moore by Latif Nasser appear on an episode of the radio program Radiolab titled "Oliver Sipple", which was released on September 22, 2017. In the interview, Moore discusses the scene from the day she attempted to assassinate Ford and her perspective of being stopped by Oliver Sipple.[33]
In popular culture[edit]
Moore is a character in Stephen Sondheim and John Weidman's musical Assassins, which is about presidential assassins, both successful and unsuccessful. Moore, John Wilkes Booth, Charles J. Guiteau, and Leon Czolgosz appear in "The Gun Song".
A biography of Moore called Taking Aim at the President was published in 2009 by Geri Spieler, a writer who had a correspondence with Moore for 28 years.[34][35]
Suburban Fury, a 2024 Robinson Devor documentary about Moore, filmed after her release from prison, was selected to screen in the Main Slate section of the 2024 New York Film Festival.[36]
