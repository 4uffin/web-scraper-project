Instructions for nominators[edit]
ShortcutWP:DYKNOMWP:DYKNOM
If this is your first nomination, please read the DYK rules before continuing. Further information can be found at the DYK guidelines.
Nominate an article
Frequently asked questions[edit]
How do I write an interesting hook?
Successful hooks tend to have several traits. Most importantly, they share a surprising or intriguing fact. They give readers enough context to understand the hook, but leave enough out to make them want to learn more. They are written for a general audience who has no prior knowledge of or interest in the topic area. Lastly, they are concise, and do not attempt to cover multiple facts or present information about the subject beyond what's needed to understand the hook.
When will my nomination be reviewed?
This page is often backlogged. As long as your submission is still on the page, it will stay there until an editor reviews it. Since editors are encouraged to review the oldest submissions first, it may take several weeks until your submission is reviewed. In the meantime, please consider reviewing another submission (not your own) to help reduce the backlog (see instructions below). Because of WP:DYKTIMEOUT, a nomination should be reviewed within two months since the reviewer/promoter may agree to reject and close an unpromoted hook after that time has passed.
Where is my hook?
If you can't find the nomination you submitted to this nominations page, it may have been approved and is on the approved nominations page waiting to be promoted. It could also have been added to one of the prep areas,
promoted from prep to a queue, or is on the main page.
If the nominated hook is in none of those places, then the nomination has probably been rejected. Such a rejection usually only occurs if it was at least a couple of weeks old and had unresolved issues for which any discussion had gone stale. If you think your nomination was unfairly rejected, you can query this on the DYK discussion page or with the closer, but as a general rule such nominations will only be restored in exceptional circumstances. If your nomination was promoted, but it hasn't reached the main page after two weeks, you can also query this on the DYK discussion page.
Instructions for reviewers[edit]
Main page: Wikipedia:Did you know/Reviewer instructions
Any editor who was not involved in writing/expanding or nominating an article may review it by checking to see that the article meets all the DYK criteria (long enough, new enough, no serious editorial or content issues) and the hook is cited. Editors may also alter the suggested hook to improve it, suggest new hooks, or even lend a hand and make edits to the article to which the hook applies so that the hook is supported and accurate. For more information on the DYK rules and review processes, see the DYK guidelines and the reviewer instructions.
To post a comment or review on a DYK nomination, follow the steps outlined below:
Look through this page, Template talk:Did you know, to find a nomination you would like to comment on.
Click the "Review or comment" link at the top of the nomination. You will be taken to the nomination subpage.
The top of the page includes a list of the DYK criteria. Check the article to ensure it meets all the relevant criteria.
To indicate the result of the review (i.e., whether the nomination passes, fails, or needs some minor changes), leave a signed comment on the page. Please begin with one of the 5 review symbols that appear at the top of the edit screen, and then indicate all aspects of the article that you have reviewed; your comment should look something like the following:Article length and age are fine, no copyvio or plagiarism concerns, reliable sources are used. But the hook needs to be shortened.
If you are the first person to comment on the nomination, there will be a line :* <!-- REPLACE THIS LINE TO WRITE FIRST COMMENT, KEEPING
:*
--> showing you where you should put the comment.
Save the page.
After the nomination is approved, a bot will automatically list the nomination page on Template talk:Did you know/Approved.
If there is any problem or concern about a nomination, please consider notifying the nominator by placing {{subst:DYKproblem|Article|header=yes|sig=yes}} on the nominator's talk page.
Advanced procedures[edit]
How to promote an accepted hook[edit]
At-a-glance instructions on how to promote an approved hook to a prep area
See Wikipedia:Did you know/Preparation areas for details on verifying a hook's acceptability.
Promoters should not promote their own nomination or their own review.
When promoting hooks intended for a particular date, keep in mind that when the number of available approved nominations exceeds 120 we switch to two sets per day, and when that number drops below 60 we return to one set per day.
Check list for nomination review completeness
Select a hook from the approved nominations page that has one of these ticks at the bottom post:
.
Check to make sure basic review requirements were completed.
Any outstanding issue following
needs to be addressed before promoting.
Check the article history for any substantive changes since it was nominated or reviewed.
Images for the lead slot must be freely licensed. Fair-use images are not permitted. Images loaded on Commons that appear on the Main Page are automatically protected by KrinkleBot.
Hook must be stated in both the article and source (which must be cited at the end of the article sentence where stated).
Hook should make sense grammatically.
Try to vary subject matters within each prep area.
Try to select a funny, quirky or otherwise upbeat hook for the last or bottom hook in the set.
Steps to add a hook to prep
In one tab, open the nomination page of the hook you want to promote.
In a second tab, open the prep set you intend to add the hook to.
Wanna skip all this fuss? Install WP:PSHAW instead! Does most of the heavy lifting for ya :)
For hooks held for specific dates, refer to "Local update times" section on
DYK Queue.
Completed Prep area number sets will be promoted by an administrator to corresponding Queue number.
Copy and paste the hook into a chosen slot.
Make sure there's a space between ... and that, and a ? at the end.
Check that there's a bold link to the article.
If it's the lead (first) hook, paste the image where indicated at the top of the template.
Copy and paste ALL the credit information (the {{DYKmake}} and {{DYKnom}} templates) at the bottom
Check your work in the prep's Preview mode.
At the bottom under "Credits", to the right of each article should have the link "View nom subpage" ; if not, a subpage parameter will need to be added to the DYKmake.
Save the Prep page.
Closing the DYK nomination page
At the upper left
Change {{DYKsubpage to {{subst:DYKsubpage
Change |passed= to |passed=yes
At the bottom
Just above the line containing }}<!--Please do not write below this line or remove this line. Place comments above this line.-->
insert a new, separate line containing one of the following:
To [[TM:DYK/P1|Prep 1]]
To [[TM:DYK/P2|Prep 2]]
To [[TM:DYK/P3|Prep 3]]
To [[TM:DYK/P4|Prep 4]]
To [[TM:DYK/P5|Prep 5]]
To [[TM:DYK/P6|Prep 6]]
To [[TM:DYK/P7|Prep 7]]
Also paste the same thing into the edit summary.
Check in Preview mode. Make sure everything is against a pale blue background (nothing outside) and there are no stray characters, like }}, at the top or bottom.
Save.
For more information, please see T:TDYK#How to promote an accepted hook.

How to remove a rejected nomination[edit]
Open the DYK nomination subpage of the nomination you would like to remove.
In the window where the DYK nomination subpage is open, replace the line {{DYKsubpage with {{subst:DYKsubpage, and replace |passed= with |passed=no. Then save the page. This has the effect of wrapping up the discussion on the DYK nomination subpage in a blue archive box and stating that the nomination was unsuccessful, as well as adding the nomination to a category for archival purposes.
Alternatively, you can use PSHAW, which automates the process.
How to remove a hook from the prep areas or queue[edit]
Edit the prep area or queue where the hook is and remove the hook and the credits associated with it.
Go to the hook's nomination subpage (there should have been a link to it in the credits section).
View the edit history for that page
Go back to the last version before the edit where the hook was promoted, and revert to that version to make the nomination active again.
Add a new icon on the nomination subpage to cancel the previous tick and leave a comment after it explaining that the hook was removed from the prep area or queue, and why, so that later reviewers are aware of this issue.
Add a transclusion of the template back to this page so that reviewers can see it. It goes under the date that it was first created/expanded/listed as a GA. You may need to add back the day header for that date if it had been removed from this page.
If you removed the hook from a queue, it is best to either replace it with another hook from one of the prep areas, or to leave a message at WT:DYK asking someone else to do so.
How to move a nomination subpage to a new name[edit]
Don't; it should not ever be necessary, and will break some links which will later need to be repaired. Even if you change the title of the article, you don't need to move the nomination page.

@RobinIsadorable: Hello, and welcome to DYK. Right now, I would suggest that you propose a new hook, as the current one may not be considered interesting to those unfamiliar with the Wave-Gotik-Treffen or Ships in the Night. Will you be able to do that? If you need any help our guidance, feel free to let me or another editor know. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 10:41, 31 July 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Narutolovehinata5: Hi, thank you for your comment! I added an alternative hook. Would appreciate any additional guidance if that doesn't work either. RobinIsadorable (talk) 14:55, 31 July 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Yes, the new hook works. I've struck the original. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 23:39, 31 July 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Thank you for article and hook, User:RobinIsadorable, - nice to meet you, and I agree with your user name ;) - The article is detailed and referenced throughout. I wonder about the pronoun, beginning with "their" but then "she"? - Please find something to link the article to. - Normally there would be a link to the performer. As they have no article, there should be a redirect from their name to this article, and the name should be bold. A bit more about the person (birth day or year, place of birth, education ...) would be nice. - The image is licensed and a good illustration. It would perhaps be stronger if cropped, because the detail on the left doesn't show well in stamp-size. I trimmed the caption. - We should not use a given name in the article once the full name was introduced, also no link is needed for New York City. - A bit about the vocals would also be great. - The last refs should be in ascending order. - In the hook, perhaps you want to include something like insomnia, rather than all three outside sounds. - --Gerda Arendt (talk) 13:04, 5 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]

@Launchballer: The nominator hasn't edited since the 5th. Probably too soon to close this for lack of activity, but it's worth keeping in mind. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 06:28, 16 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I just actually read @Gerda Arendt:'s comment, and I can't see a single complaint that is actually necessary to fix under WP:DYKG. I did however put in a request for a crop at the Photography workshop and fixed some minor errors (essentially those that don't require research).--Launchballer 16:42, 17 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I don't know what you mean by "complaint". When I meet a new editor, I like a response. The icon is for questions, I had questions, - I can simply approve. I may eventually make fixes myself but not today. --Gerda Arendt (talk) 19:04, 17 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Narutolovehinata5 and Launchballer: Apologies for the delay, I'm back and have capacity. I can make changes if you all think they are necessary and appropriate. --RobinIsadorable (talk) 00:18, 19 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Gerda Arendt: Thank you for the feedback! I'll try to address your points. In regards to pronouns, I tried to use they/them/their when referring to the musical project Ships in the Night and she/her/hers when referring to Leventhal (though I will say I don't see their pronouns personally stated in any sources, so I'm a little hesitant to stick with she/her/hers). Couldn't really find information about Leventhal's personal details. In the hook, I decided to focus on melody inspirations in order to convey the kinds of sounds that inspire the music rather than subject matter (which is inspired by or deals with a number of different topics) for brevity's sake. I could definitely expand the hook to include that. I added a redirect from Alethea Leventhal. I think your other points were addressed by other editors including a photo crop found here: File:WGT 2025 Ships In The Night 01 (cropped).jpg.
Thank you for explaining. The cropped image is better suitable for the Main page. --Gerda Arendt (talk) 06:26, 19 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hi @RobinIsadorable, Gerda Arendt, Launchballer,
and Narutolovehinata5: I'm just reopening this one because I've just reviewed this article in the Queue and I became confused by the flipping between discussion of the "band" Ships in the Night versus the "singer" Alethea Leventhal. And I see that Gerda raised similar issues in her comment above, so this seems like something that should be addressed. In particular, a few points:
It is unclear if Ships in the Night has become a de facto stage name for Leventhal, or if there is a clear distinction between the act under one name and the individual under the other. The attached image showing the individual but using the group name adds to this confusion.
There is a strong implication through the article that Leventhal identifies as non-binary, with repeated use of they/them pronouns. For example "In 2024, Leventhal signed with Metropolis Records to release their third full-length album, Protection Spells". But from what I can gather, Leventhal in fact identifies as female and is referred to in sources as she/her. I think this needs to be made clearer, probably through consistency in which bits of the article refer to the individual and which to the "band".
Nothing insurmountable here, and thanks to RobinIsadorable for writing this and submitting your first DYK, we just need a little bit of tidying up I think. I will help out myself if I have some time in the coming days, but a little busy right now. Cheers  — Amakuru (talk) 09:52, 3 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Amakuru: Thank you for the feedback! I've made some edits to the article. Would appreciate you and others to give it a view to make sure it makes more sense. — RobinIsadorable (talk) 14:56, 5 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

dxneo Lots of ways to shorten the hook.
You're at 159 characters.
You can shorten that considerably and get it down to between 80-140 characters.
Play around with it.

@Dxneo: Comment: The "Composition" section is bordering on non-encyclopedic, non-neutral, and promotional.
Example: "Opening with "Dynamite" alongside Wizkid, the duo exchanges seductive lyrics, blending their vocal tones in a catchy, danceable track that carries you from home to the party." Viriditas (talk) 23:16, 25 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]

@Dxneo: Parts of this article appear to be out of date and require an update:
For example: We Wanna Party is scheduled for release in 2025 by FAX and Epic Records. Viriditas (talk) 01:33, 26 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Yup! The actual mixtape is still coming. Sources, and Tyla herself, called the EP a bridge to the LP. Therefore, I don't think it's out of date. She pulled the very same move with her debut studio album and Christina Aguilera did the same with Aguilera. Oh, and I see you've put commas before the word "and", at GA and PR/FAC, they gonna remove those. Struggled a lot with that in the past. dxneo (talk) 02:20, 26 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I've never engaged in an argument about commas and don't have any plans to do so in the future.
Not at all clear what you mean by "they gonna remove those" so I'll leave it you to use them as you prefer.
However, even if the material isn't out of date, the "Background and release" doesn't make much sense the way it is currently written, moving from singles to mixtape, to a scheduled release at some point in the future, to the EP and then back to the mixtape, and then to the future LP.
If you think it's fine the way it is currently written, let me know, and I'll drop this and move on to another DYK. Viriditas (talk) 02:45, 26 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]

You can try.
The discussion about the streaming metrics is interesting, but you would need to revisit the sources and rewrite it a bit.
The point is to not give up so easily and to try and push the envelope of what is possible.
I'm currently going slightly crazy writing a draft about an 1889 train robbery in my sandbox, but I know there's a light at the end of the tunnel where I will come out in the end.

Musical works are notoriously hard to find decent hooks for. I think your best bet is something like ALT2: ... that Tyla's 2025 EP was streamed 60 million times on Spotify in its first three weeks and still missed the Billboard Hot 100?--Launchballer 01:37, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
This is truly amazing! The hook needs a little tweak tho, Hot 100 to Billboard 200. Something like ALT2a: ... that Tyla's 2025 EP accumulated 60 million streams on Spotify in its first three weeks, but failed to chart on the Billboard 200? Thoughts? dxneo (talk) 02:15, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oh yeah. I wouldn't be able to approve that though - perhaps Viriditas would like to do the honours.--Launchballer 02:18, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Looks good. Approving ALT2a. This is not a deal breaker for DYK, but the wording in the article is "As of 14 August 2025,". I think that the wording in the hook is more clear and would improve the article. The article meets Wikipedia content policies, has no plagiarism, is long enough, was recently expanded, and is cited with inline citations, Rjjiii (talk) 02:52, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Reviewing for promotion, and I cannot find the statement in ALT2a that the song failed to chart on the Billboard 200 in the source provided by the article (fn14). Perhaps it's in a different source? Courtesy ping @Dxneo, Launchballer, Rjjiii,

I'll let a reviewer/promoter adjudicate.--Launchballer 11:11, 19 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Articles do not need to be GA-quality to be featured on DYK, even if they are a 5x expansion. The article looks good enough and can probably be run as is, assuming there are no more copyedits to be done. You could nominate it for GA status, although given that process's backlog, waiting would likely lead to this nomination timing out.

Full review needed; per DYKcheck article is 5x expanded since July 27, and nominating eight days after expansion began is perfectly legal per DYK rules. BlueMoonset (talk) 21:16, 9 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The article was created in 2016 and received a 5x expansion 7-8 days before the nomination. The article is largely free from close paraphrasing, but the problem is that some parts appear to be very close to this link. That will need to be addressed before this can be reviewed further, although as Launchballer said, that might bring the article to below a 5x expansion, so keep that in mind. A QPQ has been performed and it is a complete one. The hook is cited inline and interesting, although the Newspapers.com link doesn't actually mention that exact quote, so an excerpt may be needed here. Technically, the hook is not DYKHFC compliant, but I will accept it as is because the entire quote is referenced to a single source.
The elephant in the room is that I actually think that him becoming an accomplished doctor after his running career is the more interesting hook fact here. I know that some DYK editors are not fans of "person A, who was a B, was later a C" hooks, but in this case it actually is unusual and interesting. I would suggest proposing that as an ALT, although the nomination's fate depends on the close paraphrasing being resolved. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 09:30, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Narutolovehinata5: I'm not sure how much the text sourced to that can be reworded – most of it is all long medical titles such as "founding chair of robotic and minimally invasive surgery of Kaiser Permanente" and "regional chief of colon and rectal surgery for the Southern California Permanente Medical Group". Thoughts? BeanieFan11 (talk) 23:38, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@BeanieFan11: While technically it could fall under WP:LIMITED, the wordings are so close to each other that it would still raise eyebrows. I could pass it, but I don't think other editors would be happy about it. There could be a way to simplify or even remove those titles. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 23:53, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Do you have any ideas on ways to simplify the titles? A lot of it is just names of the universities and complex titles like "founding chair of robotic and minimally invasive surgery of Kaiser Permanente" where I don't see a way to simplify. I think they're relevant to his life as the jobs he held and probably shouldn't be removed entirely. BeanieFan11 (talk) 00:00, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Honestly, I'm not so sure. It might be a good idea to ask a copyvio expert like RoySmith or Nikkimaria on what to do next. If you ever plan to bring this to GA, now would be a good time to resolve this as it will likely be brought up at GAN if it's not resolved by then. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 01:20, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
IMO the issue is less the titles and more bringing over the other CV/promobio stuff like having conducted 30 studies - I'd suggest omitting that. Nikkimaria (talk) 01:24, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Cut the 30 studies part. BeanieFan11 (talk) 02:07, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The removal has now brought the article to below 5x expansion. As this has been an issue since the start of the nomination, I feel that if it really isn't possible to bring it back up, that nomination should just be withdrawn and the article nominated for GA. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 07:01, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Given the circumstances, it doesn't seem feasible that this will stand as a 5x expansion. BeanieFan11 I suggest nominating the article for GA and trying again once it's promoted. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 22:38, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Give me maybe three or four hours to take another look at this. BeanieFan11 (talk) 22:38, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Narutolovehinata5: The article now stands at 5,262 bytes. A 5x expansion would be 5,025 bytes. Is this acceptable now? BeanieFan11 (talk) 22:55, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
To be honest, given how the nomination has turned out and the earlier issues with reaching 5x, it seems too borderline for me to personally sign it off. It being a new GA would at least give it a more airtight chance. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 22:57, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Well, is it enough for the rejection to be rescinded? BeanieFan11 (talk) 22:59, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
You could ask for a second opinion on that from a neutral editor, but I'm personally leaning against it given how borderline the 5x expansion is and further copyedits (if needed) are enough to lower it. I won't object if another editor says yes. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 23:05, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
In the unlikely scenario that another editor finds a need for such a substantial copyedit that would reduce the article's length by over 250 characters, then it could be declined – but I don't think its fair to reject an article that's been 5x expanded because "well yeah it's been 5x expanded, but only by a little bit".

@Dclemens1971: I tried to summarize a quote (or two). Ian Eisendrath, a main producer of the songs, said their goal was to create one of those super bubblegum-y K-pop boy band songs hence "catchy", and a later quote If you really look at them, the underpinning is like, ‘We’re going to devour you. We’re going to eat you up. We are going to drink you up’ because that’s what the demons do hence "deceiving".

@TheNuggeteer: Watch for the link to a dab page in the hook. I still think ALT1's not quite there, in part because of the "band-within-a-show" element of this song makes the mention of the movie title a bit of excessive detail. How's this? ALT1a: ... that while "Soda Pop" appears to be "bubblegum-y K-pop boy band" song, it is actually about demons devouring souls? P.S.

Viktor Glondys
( Comment or viewArticle history )
... that Viktor Glondys was the first non-Transylvanian Saxon in 380 years to be elected bishop of the Evangelical Church of the Augsburg Confession in Romania?
Source: Ulrich A. Wien (2017). "Kirche und Politik im Verständnis der Bischöfe Viktor Glondys und Wilhelm Staede", in RT 99, vol. 1, p. 123. (in German). Translated excerpt: “He was first appointed parish priest in the economically cosmopolitan city of Kronstadt in 1922, then elected vicar bishop to the elderly Bishop Dr. Friedrich Teutsch in 1930, and finally, in 1932, he became the first non-Saxon in 380 years to be elected bishop of the regional church.”
ALT1: ... that Viktor Glondys converted from Catholicism to Lutheranism during his philosophical studies in Graz, likely influenced by the teachings of Alexius Meinong? Source: Beyer, Hans (1964). Viktor Glondys, 1882–1949: ein Beitrag zur Geistes- und Kirchengeschichte des Südostdeutschtums zwischen den beiden Weltkriegen. [Festschrift für Balduin Saria zum 70. Geburtstag] (in German). Oldenbourg. p. 420.

Comment: If relevant (I have never done this before), in the source it says "non-Saxon", which is meant to refer specifically to Transylvanian Saxons. This is clarified later when he refers to the Saxons from then on as "Siebenbürger Sachsen" (Transylvanian Saxon).

Welcome to DYK! What a thorough article -- you could consider nominating it as a Good Article too. The DYK criteria look well met. Regarding the hook, DYK strongly discourages "first"-based hooks and I don't think ALT0 will work. ALT1 is supported by the source, but as written doesn't strike me as very interesting to a non-specialist. I'd propose the following as something with a "catchier" wording that is still supported by the source:
ALT2: ... that Viktor Glondys converted from Catholicism to Lutheranism while the Away from Rome! movement was popular, but he had his own reasons?
If you're OK with that hook suggestion, we could go with that, or you could suggest some others. There may be something interesting to do with the wars, eg, fleeing on foot shortly after his doctorate, or the controversial Good Samarital speech. The trick (and it is tricky) is to boil down the details into something that feels accessible and leaves the reader wanting more to piece it together. ~ L 🌸 (talk) 08:47, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@LEvalyn: Hi, thank you for the feedback. I think what you suggested would be a good hook that I would be fine with, but also, since you suggested the speech here is another one if it might be better:
... that Viktor Glondys delivered a sermon in 1931 based on the Good Samaritan that rejected Nazi racial ideology, prompting attacks from pro-Nazi groups?
Here are the sources for that one:
Ulrich A. Wien (2017). "Kirche und Politik im Verständnis der Bischöfe Viktor Glondys und Wilhelm Staede", in RT 99, vol. 1, p. 126. (in German).

Article new and long enough. QPQ provided, hook interesting and cited inline and verified in the source, image properly licensed. Copyvio not detected. Good to go. Juxlos (talk) 03:59, 10 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I came here from the WP:CGR page, where I saw that this article had been nominated for DYK. I know nothing about the DYK process, but my impression of the article itself is mostly negative. In order to avoid cluttering up the DYK template, I've started a separate section on the talk page listing some of the problems (misspellings, ungrammatical sentences, inadequate sources, sources not properly credited, at least three citations that fail verification). WP:DYK says "Articles must meet the basic criteria set out on this page, but do not have to be of very high quality". Fair enough. I don't know how low the bar is; perhaps this is within the range considered normal and acceptable at DYK. But to me, as an outsider to the process, it certainly does not seem "good to go", or ready to be featured on the front page.

Moved from Wikipedia talk:Did you know § Takashi Kimura (politician) hook
@Miminity, AirshipJungleman29,
and Dclemens1971:
My issue is with this hook:
" ... that a Japanese governor was born without a left wrist?" The hook is making fun of a disability the politician has. This reminds of this hook, that was struck immediately for making fun of a name. Don't we have anything better?
Maybe a rewriting of ALT2?
ALT2a: "... that Takashi Kimura used manga to develop a community?"
Or maybe a rebranding of ALT3?
ALT4: "... that a Japanese governor was criticized after donating moth orchids?" Earth605 (talk) 14:03, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
How is it making fun of him? That seems like an odd accusation. Dclemens1971 (talk) 14:08, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Some people are different and we just have to accept it. Pointing to that is a bit rude...
Also, if this makes a good hook, it is because people are going to think: "Oh, he overcome that, how cool..." By saying "he overcome" that means he is inferior. Red flag for that. It is also a bit insulting that it is a quirky hook. Earth605 (talk) 14:13, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
See the hook I pointed to. Earth605 (talk) 14:14, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The fact that humans have differences in their bodies, with some differences being rarer than others, is not rude to observe. It would be making fun if the hook was using that fact to denigrate or slight him. There's no assumption embedded that he's overcome anything; I think that's something you may be reading into it. Dclemens1971 (talk) 15:02, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Please explain how simply stating an unusual fact is "making fun of a disability" Earth605, or strike that aspersion. ~~ AirshipJungleman29 (talk) 15:58, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I have a different objection to the same hook: "wrist"? When I read that, I thought he somehow has fingers on the end of his arm without the intervening joint, something like John Silber. From reading the sources, it looks like he's missing his whole hand, including wrist, fingers, palm, etc. If we're going with the "born without" hook at all, I strongly believe we should write "without a left hand", since, honestly, the hand is the important part, not the wrist. --GRuban (talk) 17:27, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
If a child called out in public "Look mommy, that man only has one hand!" they would get a slap and told not to be rude.
Surely we can find a better hook. RoySmith-Mobile (talk) 17:45, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I agree with the above. Thanks for explaining it in a better way! Earth605 (talk) 18:09, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Yes, the "Look mommy" rule. Would an imaginary mom (pathologically violent and/or physically abusive as the case may be) believe a child was inappropriate for saying one of our DYK hooks? Let's apply it to, oh, the most recent DYK, shall we? 16 September 2025.
"Look mommy, Emperor Tenmu had his sons swear to honor his consort and niece Uno-no-sarara as their mother, including two of her brothers"
"Look mommy, a 1981 article about the disease of Turku claimed that the city council of Turku was made up of Finnish Freemasons"
"Look mommy, minister George Freeman ran The Monastery as a gay church, nightclub, and homeless shelter"
"Look mommy, 50,000 inhabitants "burned alive" in the sacking of Tbilisi"
"Look mommy, No Kaebang's wife, preferring death to capture by Japanese troops, leapt from a cliff"
"Look mommy, the app Baby Shaker was removed from the App Store for letting players shake a baby to death"
I dare say the "Look mommy" rule would disqualify basically all of those. Therefore, I somehow think it's not a very good rule for DYK. --GRuban (talk) 00:44, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Not all are covered by the "Look mommy" rule.
1st has no sense for the rule. It is not non-apppropiate.
2nd the imaginary mom wouldn't slap him for Finnish Masons?
Ok, maybe the 3rd could be, but it is interesting and refers to a building and not a person. Maybe George Freeman, even if he is alive, but no.

--GRuban (talk) 01:03, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The issue with the hook is actually different from what has already been discussed here. I do not think the hook was intending to make fun of Kimura, but rather the opposite: "despite being born without a wrist, he rose to become a Japanese prefectural governor." Which is actually interesting and inspiring, and far from making fun of Kimura, is praising him. The issue is that this could be interpreted as inspiration porn, so such stories are quite controversial among disabled people and their advocates. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 00:47, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
It is inspiration porn. I need to apologize now. English is not my native language, so sorry for not explaining the issue properly. Thanks.
Earth605 (talk) 04:22, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I agree in part. On a different note, while pointing out that somebody has a disability shouldn't be inherently offensive, treating it as though it's the most interesting thing about them can be perceived as insulting. It's a bit cultural/generational, though, which I think explains the disconnect.
...that Japanese governor Takashi Kimura grew up admiring American baseball player Jim Abbott because they were both born without a hand? [7] Yes? No? Needs trimmed? (And the fact would need added to the article ofc, but it's barely above a stub. I think there's room for a few more details like that) It's kind of cute, in a way, the story of this little kid who wanted to be a baseball player because he saw somebody like him. YMMV. Is wordier than the original hook, which doesn't help performance. GreenLipstickLesbian💌🦋 14:03, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Nice idea. I wouldn't oppose it, but I think it is not the best hook possible. We are not also in a strive for perfection, sooo, yeaaah. It is a good hook. Maybe check out my proposals? Earth605 (talk) 16:29, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I saw them; the first one is interesting, but afaict was only sourced to his official website. Which isn't disqualifying, but I personally don't like hooks like that. THe second I would oppose on BLP reasons - it's a controversy, it implies he might have done something illegal. If he was dead, then I would like it. But he isn't. (Note: last sentence is not a call to assassinate Kimura; besides, BLP often applies for a year or two after death)GreenLipstickLesbian💌🦋 20:38, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
To a random person that sees DYK every day, I think the word "criticized" wouldn't imply a controversy. After further thought, I think we could add this detail, and that the hook is Goodenough Earth605 (talk) 04:35, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

I'd be okay with the Jim Abbott angle since it still mentions the "no hand/wrist" angle but is written in a way that isn't meant to be inspiration porn or mockery; in fact, it even seems to show that Kimura was proud of that connection.

A 5x expansion has been verified by DYK check and I did not find any close paraphrasing. A QPQ has been verified and it is a complete review. The article is long enough for DYK purposes and meets the referencing guidelines.
However, the hook is problematic. Firstly, it is not directly stated in the article: nowhere does it say that it was "marketed with copies signed by Henrietta Stannard". Second, even if the claim was mentioned, it doesn't seem to actually be referenced. Thirdly, and most worryingly, even if those issues were addressed, the hook would not meet WP:DYKINT. The context here is that Winter is actually Stannard's penname, but the average reader may not be familiar with either name, so the connection is lost. Even without the context, the hook does not seem very interesting if the reader is unfamiliar with Stannard and her work (FWIW I've never heard of her prior to this nomination).
You have done a good job of expanding the article, but to be honest, after reading it, I'm not sure if there's actually anything here that's workable. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 02:26, 28 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]

My apologies for the delay— my off-wiki life has been tumultuous this week. In the next few days I can look for an alternative hook; there may be something I can add to the article with the film adaptation. I personally don’t think the hook relies on knowing either name (she’s a completely obscure author) but I think it’s interesting that she basically makes her pseudonym useless (which I think the cited ad verifies); I may be able to come up with a better wording for that idea. Regardless I’d appreciate a few days to work on it, please, with my thanks for your thorough review. ~ L 🌸 (talk) 20:33, 31 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Narutolovehinata5, what do you think about ALT1: ...that Henrietta Stannard autographed copies of John Strange Winter’s novel Lady Jennifer?
That phrasing is definitely verified by the ad, which has the headline Autographed Copies of John Strange Winter's Latest Novel and says Mrs. Stannard ("John Strange Winter") will be pleased to send a specially signed copy... My aim is to intrigue someone who has never heard of either name -- I think it's interesting that she's a woman with a male pseudonym who is undermining that pseudonym with her marketing campaign.
Or, perhaps another angle is something like ALT2: ...that Henrietta Stannard bundled her novel Lady Jennifer with promotional materials for John Strange Winter's Toilet Preparations?
I'd have to beef it up in the article a bit but the mail-in autograph promo automatically gave a free copy of Comely Woman with every Lady Jennifer, and elsewhere I've seen info about how this book basically just sold her cosmetics line. ~ L 🌸 (talk) 20:04, 2 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Regrettably, I do not think this Stannard/Strange Winter angle will work out, as the main issue (that the hooks do not make sense or will not interest people who do not know either name or at least the context) remains. I understand what you're trying to get to, but it's not showing in the hook proposals, and given what is in the article, the angle just seems like a non-starter. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 22:16, 2 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
You don't think the cosmetics line part is any better? I didn't think that one relied on the author's names, and in fact we could remove Stannard's name entirely, i.e., ALT3: ... that the novel Lady Jennifer cross-promoted John Strange Winter's Toilet Preparations? (Again, I'd be able to beef up the article properly for that if it seemed like an interesting angle.) I thought "Toilet Preparations" might also be an intriguing product name for a general audience. ~ L 🌸 (talk) 23:17, 2 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
ALT3 is a bit of a weird one in that I'm 50-50. On the one hand, it doesn't solve the "you must know who John Strange Winter" issue, but on the other hand, the name itself along with "Toilet Preparations" might be enough to raise attention. I'm undecided at this point, so I think it might be a good idea to ask for a second opinion from one of the usual DYK scrutinizers like RoySmith, Amakuru, Launchballer, etc. I should note that, if ever, only ALT3 is under consideration, and all the other hooks, particularly those involving the name Henrietta Stannard, are rejected.

I wrote all of the film material after the 5x expansion so it's not needed to meet that criteria.

@Narutolovehinata5, LEvalyn, RoySmith,
and Amakuru: I'm fine with ALT3.--Launchballer 12:07, 5 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Here since I was pinged above – personally I would not sign off on ALT3. As someone unfamiliar with the subject, the hook as written makes no sense to me. Who is John Strange Winter, and ehat are "Toilet Preparations" (particularly when rendered in title case like this)? And how exactly does the book "cross-promote" them? And then it's not immediately obvious where in the article to look. The words "Toilet" and "cross-promote" don't appear anywhere in the article and it turns out "Toilet Preparations" is actually "J. S. W. Preparations". No offence to anyone, but IMHO it seems a little weak to me to premise the hook on a pun on the word toilet that doesn't even appear in the article.
As an aside, I agree with the comment above that the film article should be redirected to this one, there isn't enough content overall for two separate articles on these closely related topics at this time and WP:NOPAGE would apply for me. It's a pity the WP:BLAR was reverted, it might have to go through AFD or a merge discussion on the talk page. Cheers  — Amakuru (talk) 13:08, 5 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Thanks for weighing in, and thanks to Narutolovehinata5 for your patience with this one. With regret, I'll withdraw the DYK.

Though to be clear Amakuru, they really were called John Strange Winter's Toilet Preparations! I just hadn't clipped the source for the article yet. ~ L 🌸 (talk) 18:36, 5 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hi @LEvalyn: thanks for the reply, and if you're able to make the hook tally up with something in the article I'll be happy to re-evaluate it... I haven't looked at this in detail, but hopefully either way we can save something from this, no need to throw in the towel just yet! Cheers  — Amakuru (talk) 19:25, 5 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
That's very kind, Amakuru. The article now says To promote the book, Stannard offered signed copies by mail order... With the novel, she included free copies of Comely Woman, a book of advice promoting her line of cosmetics products, John Strange Winter Toilet Preparations (with a wikilink to Toilet#Names to help solve the mystery of the name), and I've named the section "Publication and promotion" to make it easier to spot. To a certain extent I think "Who is John Strange Winter and what are 'Toilet Preparations'?" is the "intrigue" I was hoping to raise-- hopefully the article now has answers to those. Maybe some more compelling or clearer wordings:

@Vigilantcosmicpenguin and Yue: Reviewing for promotion and this is failing my common-sense test. First of all, the source (I checked with my own translation says "the city has never had electricity". This is not the same as not having an electric grid; is there a source that specifies the absence of a grid? The source's claim of no electricity is plainly belied by the photos in the article, which show satellite dishes and buildings with air conditioning and what very much appear to be power lines in the lead image. This is a fairly exceptional claim and needs a robust source or perhaps multiple sources. Dclemens1971 (talk) 04:20, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Dclemens1971: As the article states, electricity has been planned and tested, but not successfully implemented. It can be presumed that the visible power lines are from incomplete constructions. The Actualite.cd source makes it a bit more clear that, in 2024 (the same year the photograph was taken), electricity is not available in Kikwit. I believe this, in addition with the KAS paper, is enough sourcing to verify that the city does not have electricity. However you are correct that my phrasing of "electrical grid" is not quite the same as what the source says, so I have tweaked the article to say "supply of electricity". The same change should be applied to the hook. — Vigilant Cosmic Penguin 🐧 (talk | contribs) 05:49, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Vigilantcosmicpenguin: I did some digging here because the statement electricity is not available in Kikwit is quite exceptional. There is evidence here (see page 24, table 2) that Kikwit has had (underpowered) gas power plants in 1980 and 2000. This map from Africa Energy indicates a thermal plant was operational in Kikwit as of 2025. A USAID report from 2019 found (p 5) that In Kikwit, only four percent of 174,000 households have access to electricity. As I'd expect in a place without reliable sources of utility electricity, Kikwit residents use generators, a point confirmed by a map based on official data sources: One significant factor contributing to Kikwit's current energy situation is the lack of an extensive power grid infrastructure. The city experiences frequent power outages and relies on small-scale diesel generators for electricity, particularly in rural areas. A 2021 interview with someone born in Kikwit commented on how generators were used and electricity would shut off at 9pm. A 1991 New York Times article describes the city as having had electrical service in the past but now relying on generators. All this indicates the source provided above that says, in translation, Since its creation, the city has never had electricity is incorrect. What I do think is uncontestable is that local power sources are insufficient to meet Kikwit's needs and that as a World Bank report (p 42) indicates, Kikwit is not on the DRC's electrical grid. It may well have its own grid that is underpowered. Moreover, if electricity is supplied via generators, it is still supplied, even if at higher cost and with less reliability. Bottom line, I think the hook needs to be rewritten. Dclemens1971 (talk) 12:16, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Dclemens1971: Thanks for doing some more thorough research. You're correct that electricity is supplied by generators, which is why I had initially chosen the phrasing of "electrical grid". It appears that Kikwit does not have a grid, even an isolated one, as the World Bank source you provided says: "Isolated grids could also suit a few additional mid-size towns such as Kikwit". Also, to clarify the statement that "Since its creation, the city has never had electricity", I believe this is referring to the creation of the city of Kikwit, which had not had city status before 1970. In any case, you're right that the hook will have to be more precise. How about:
ALT0a: ... that plans to supply electricity to Kikwit, a city estimated to have a population of over one million, have not yet been successful?
— Vigilant Cosmic Penguin 🐧 (talk | contribs) 20:29, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The sources I linked above indicated power was available in the city after 1970 and may still be available today from a thermal plant in insufficient supply for local needs. To be safe I'd want to shift it to something like "... that Kikwit, a city estimated to have a population of over one million, does not yet have a reliable supply of electricity?" but that's honestly not as interesting as your initial hook. However, I'm going to leave it open to another reviewer if they want to evaluate. Any other non-electricity related hooks to throw out there? Dclemens1971 (talk) 13:39, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

From source:
Over the past few months, there have been chronic reports of individuals posing as Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials, in many cases using these guises to commit unlawful acts. Impersonation of law enforcement is not an uncommon occurrence in the United States, but the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration policies, and the particular ways in which ICE enjoys anonymity, have led to increased opportunities for such behavior, endangering and exploiting immigrants and their communities, regardless of their status.

Considering we're not short of Trump-related hooks running lately, and given that US politics is a contentious topic, it might be a good idea to avoid mentioning Trump by name in the hook. People might accuse us of Trump bashing if we run too many hooks related to him or his administration. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 05:26, 1 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Is mentioning Trump's name actually necessary for the hook fact? Isn't there a way to say the same thing or idea without mentioning him?

I'm not sure if "chronic crime problem" is the best wording here, but that's getting close. The idea I had was something like, instead of saying it was a crime, the interesting fact here is that the issue exists at all, or to reverse the order of their mention. Something like "that deportation policies led to a rise in impersonation". Another possible option would be to avoid mentioning the deportation policies and instead to say that "there has been a rise of impersonations since [year]" or something along the lines of that fact; this is not just to avoid mentioning the policies, but it also avoids mentioning the reason, thus "hooking" readers to read the article and learn why it is happening.

ALT2: ... that deportation policies in the United States led to increased opportunities for imposters to pose as immigration officials?

Do you mean a structrual flip like this? I feel like excluding the c-word here could be problematic so basically every source frames it in that context. Any instance of it is literally a Federal crime, automatically.

Gen-Mina people, Mina (historical ethnic term)

... that a 16th century ethnic term used in Africa is still used today for a Brazilian religion, a Togolese and Beninese ethnic group, and their language?
Source: ""Mina" was, however, as Hall correctly notes, certainly a term which was applied in Brazil, in some contexts, to speakers of Gbe languages. The "Casa das Minas [House of the Minas]" in Sao Luis in the province of Maranhao, for example, is a cult-house of specifically Dahomian origin, venerating spirits associated with the royal dynasty of Dahomey."Law, Robin (2005).

"The name "Minas" remained in use under French colonial rule in the twentieth century, and indeed down to the present, to refer to the inhabitants of Agbodrafo, Aneho and Glidji, and Agoue; although there remains an awareness locally that it should properly be applied only to the Elmina element in Aneho (and its offshoots), a.s distinct from the Gas at Glidji.33 It is not quite accurate, however, to state as does Hall, that these people "call themselves" Mina.34 Rather, this is an external, European coinage, which is nowadays used locally only when speaking in French. At a conference held at Aneho in 2000, I recall a member of the local community insisting that "the Minas exist only for scholars," the self-appellation of the people in their own language being "Gen.""Law, Robin (2005).

@Viriditas:, reading on this again, I'm sort of concerned that multiple usages of the university publications, the Ford Foundation, and Borgmann's own commencement address falls into WP:PRIMARY territory. The hook could've been explained in the article earlier, but you'd have to read until the legacy section where this is explicitly said. I'd also say that his climate change findings also deserve to be there as it is still talked about 60 years later. Howard the Duck (talk) 00:01, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I think you might have misread something. I would guess that 90% of this material is supported by secondary sources, some of which are connected to a university. None of it is promotional. If you have specific concerns, please share them with an example or two that illustrates what you are talking about. I don’t understand why you think the hook needs to be earlier in the article; I’ve never heard that idea before. As for climate change in legacy, you’re not exactly wrong, but you’re not exactly right.
His “legacy” of giving climate talks and writing papers on conservation was only revealed by a climate historian last month. Thinking about this further, I think you may have misunderstood my style.
The way I use primary sources most of the time is not to support the material.
Most of the secondary sources already do it.
The way I tend to do it is to point to the original source of the event or claim. So in the example of the commencement, there are multiple secondaries that point to the significance of his speech.
That’s why they published excerpts from the commencement and it’s why the journal articles cite the speech.
They are asserting the significance of it by using it. The link to the commencement, however, has nothing to do with this.
It is used to show that the speech actually occurred and as a historical pointer to his name and role in the original event. Furthermore, this isn’t the only commencement speech he gave. However, I did not cover the others because the secondary source coverage was almost nonexistent.
I found blurbs in newspapers from the time, but that’s almost primary due to its age. Therefore, they don’t appear in the bio. Viriditas (talk) 00:29, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
It's not exactly promotional, but the Ford Foundation talking about the Ford Foundation or people connected to it such as in ref #16; see for example ref #7, which is still about the Ford Foundation, but is published by a third party. Compare again ref #2, #3, ref #9; then compare to third party sources in ref #10. See WP:PRIMARYCARE: "The person's autobiography, own website, or a page about the person on an employer's or publisher's website, is an acceptable (although possibly incomplete) primary‡ source for information about what the person says about themself. Such primary sources can normally be used for non-controversial facts about the person and for clearly attributed controversial statements." (Emphasis mine.) I have no problem with these as used on the article.
There was an opportunity to explicitly say how much the reduction was on the middle part of the article. I would've preferred for this to be done that way, but won't oppose if you prefer it to be mentioned in the end.
TBH, I'm not really sure how to deal with citing speeches; I don't think Wikipedia cites MLK in proving that he delivered the I Have a Dream speech. It's obvious though that the speech was rather important in 2025 that someone dug that up and multiple WP:RS reference to it. Howard the Duck (talk) 00:37, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Yes, as I suspected, you are misreading the sources. The Ford Foundation citation is preceded by a secondary source that supports the idea it is discussing (the Sputnik crisis).
Etc. For each primary in the bio, there is usually a secondary supporting the topic. Perhaps if you read it in depth you will discover this for yourself. I’m going offline for a bit now. Viriditas (talk) 00:46, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I'm not disputing that the events didn't happen/were not true; it's just the secondary source should be used (which you had done here) and not the primary source per se. For example, when writing about laws, I do not cite the law per se a reference, but an analysis or annotation of the law. Theae primary sources can go in a "Further reading" section.

Giving this a full review. The article was seven days old at the time of the nomination. A QPQ has been done, and I did not find any close paraphrasing. The hook is cited inline, and I am accepting the excerpts. However, I'm not sure if it's really true that it was just him that was able to cut tuition in half, or if there were others involved in the decision as well. That might need to be clarified in the article. In addition, the hook itself is a bit on the weaker side: it might be worth mentioning that the university previously had the highest tuition in the state, but since that is a superlative claim, that would need strong sourcing to prove. Other than that, do you have any other possible hook angles? Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 08:58, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Thanks for taking the review.
As president of the university, Borgmann set their strategic goals and worked with the Board of Trustees to implement his vision of the future of the University of Vermont.
When the hook (and the sources) say that "Carl Borgmann reduced tuition costs for students at the University of Vermont by almost 50 percent", that implies that Borgmann worked as a leader within the administrative structure to promote his goal of reducing tuition.
This means he had to work with the Trustees to do this (which the newspaper sources of the time show), but also with the state government to eventually get the needed funds.
It is likely that the Trustees were instrumental as advisors and worked in the background to help Borgmann reduce the tuition.
Of that, there is no doubt.
But this was Borgmann's strategic vision for UVM. You can go back into the old newspapers of the time and see him personally fighting this battle in the press and in the Senate.
One of the interesting things about this fight, is that Borgmann had to raise tuition several times just to get to the point of reducing it because the funds just weren't there at the beginning. As soon as he became president in 1952, he was pushing for the reduction in tuition.[22] He was arguing that they were paying the highest in-state tuition rates at the time.[23] The previous source even refers to the tuition reduction program as "Borgmann's Financial Plan" from the very beginning.
Another source from 1952 frames the initial proposal as "Borgmann would reduce tuition for Vermonters".[24] That's pretty telling and it shows the consistency of the proposal framed as Borgmann's from its beginning in 1952 until the state finally appropriated the money in mid-1955 (March or thereabouts).
This goes on for several years.
The same campaign by Borgmann is waged in 1953.[25]
By January 1955, you can see the aggressive pressure begin to mount on the state legislature to fund a UVM appropriations bill.
Borgmann is described as "pleading" his case.[26]
After Borgmann receives approval for his plan in March,[27] he once again reiterates how the money is being used to reduce tuition.[28] This is all Borgmann.
Even with the battle won, Borgmann is still speaking out in favor of the benefits of low tuition in 1956.[29] Same thing in 1957.[30] The entire campaign to reduce tuition by getting the state to fund the university is attributed to the efforts of Borgmann and he keeps fighting the battle after winning it.
This is all him.
This secondary source by journalist and author Tom Slayton explains the history in some depth. I am convinced that this is the strongest hook from the article. I am of course willing to consider others.
But to address your points: "I'm not sure if it's really true that it was just him that was able to cut tuition in half, or if there were others involved in the decision as well". Well, it's really true.
He brought the idea of reducing tuition to UVM as president.
He campaigned for his proposal from 1952 until 1955, and even after winning, continued to defend it until he announced his resignation in 1957.
The lowered tuition rates were confirmed in 1956[31][32] and can easily be compared to the earlier sources in 1952 up above and elsewhere. In case it isn't at all clear, it was the passage of the state appropriations bill that allowed Borgmann to reduce in-state tuition.[33] Also, this is covered by the cited secondary sources in some depth. Viriditas (talk) 23:47, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Narutolovehinata5 has expressed displeasure with the ambiguity of the wording, so I am offering ALT0a as a way to clear that up:
ALT0a: ... that Carl Borgmann led a successful campaign to cut in-state tuition at the University of Vermont by almost half?
I'm almost okay with that, but I still wonder if the "highest tuition" thing could be mentioned in the hook, given that particular context is important, but given how it would be tricky to prove for sure, I'm okay with it not being mentioned. I would, however, prefer "UVM" to be spelled out in full as "University of Vermont" as most readers will not get the abbreviation. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 03:34, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Got it.
I will come up with something.
I just discovered a slew of new sources and I'm reading through them now.
I still prefer ALT0, but I can come up with a few more.
I think readers are smart enough to figure out that UVM refers to a school, and it is linked in the context of a tuition increase. I was just trying to make the hook shorter, but it's not something I'm going to argue about.
Anyway, I'm leaving for vacation in a few days so I'm highly motivated to finish this up.
I will try to offer some new hooks today. Viriditas (talk) 22:14, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
To address your interest in adding "highest tuition" to the hook, the best condensed summary of the entire topic is found in Frank Smallwood's 1997 mini-biography of Borgmann, from pages 59–60.[34] I don't see any way of putting this in a hook due to all the caveats, but I can summarize the overall gist by quoting Smallwood for you: "When Borgmann arrived as president...[the] University of Vermont ranked number one among state institutions in high tuition costs for resident students who enrolled in [arts and sciences, technology, special graduate programs]".
This was because financial aid from the state was earmarked only for the agricultural college.
Further, Borgmann found that Vermont was one of two states (along with Mississippi) that had the "lowest national percentages of college-age population" that went to college. Viriditas (talk) 01:15, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
ALT0b: ...
that the University of Vermont once had one of the highest in-state tuitions, but Carl Borgmann ran a successful campaign to cut it nearly in half by getting the state to increase funding?
ALT0c: ... that resident tuition for the University of Vermont was once one of the highest in the country, but Carl Borgmann ran a successful campaign to cut it nearly in half?
ALT0d: ... that Carl Borgmann led a successful campaign to cut in-state tuition at the University of Vermont by almost half when it was one of the highest in the country?
ALT0e: ...
that even though the University of Vermont had one of the highest in-state tuitions, Carl Borgmann was able to cut it by almost half?
ALT0f: ... that Carl Borgmann successfully cut in-state tuition at the University of Vermont by almost half when it was one of the highest in the U.S.?
ALT0g: ...
that Carl Borgmann campaigned for years to reduce in-state tuition at the University of Vermont and succeeded?
ALT0h: ...
that Carl Borgmann won his campaign to reduce in-state tuition at the University of Vermont by almost 50%?
This is a bit tricky as I'm not actually sure if any of the proposals satisfy my original concerns (not to mention the fact that three of them mention the university as just UVM, despite my preference for the school's name to be spelled out in full). Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 10:44, 20 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Narutolovehinata5: Changed UVM.
Which of your original concerns have not been addressed? The sources indicate that Borgmann led the campaign to lower UVM’s then-highest in-state resident tuition. You asked me to conisder adding highest and I did. What else needs to be done? I still think ALT0 is the most interesting and unusual, as lowering tuition hasn’t been a goal of any university president in the US for at least 30 years or more. Are you not reading that as unusual and interesting? This was an era of American history between 1952 and 1958 when federal and state funding of academia was considered normal and expected and still had a majority of support.
That changed in the early 1960s, as the removal of government funding for education gained increasing support, and with it, the promotion of student loans. This is one reason it’s so unusual and interesting. You say this is weak, but I see it as the strongest hook. For some context, this is a prequel, thematic series bookend hook from the past to my hook from the future, Template:Did you know nominations/Roger_A._Freeman_(economist).
You can see how the two are extremes of the other. Freeman was partly responsible for reversing the educational trends Borgmann sought to replicate from the Midwest to New England.
It’s
all connected on a U.S. ideological spectrum. The two hooks are opposite and complementary. Viriditas (talk) 20:28, 20 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I actually find it interesting, the issue is the wording. I already mentioned earlier that the proposed wordings made it seem that Borgmann single-handedly lowered the tuition, when as far as I know, such decisions usually involved multiple people (such as a school's board). I'm not sure if it was the case here, but the ambiguity was what was giving me pause. The broader context you provided is irrelevant, the issue has always been the wording. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 07:26, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I thought I already addressed the concerns with the wording. Borgmann, as the sources show, was the president of the university and the principal architect of reducing tuition at UVM, and made it his personal mission. I’ve provided many sources up above that support this, including the hook source. You seem to be bringing an unusual sense of skepticism to a topic that doesn’t necessitate it. Borgmann discusses how his focus on reducing tuition was part of his larger policy and legacy. Once he left the university for the Ford Foundation, there was nobody there to continue the policy of tuition reductions and tuition began to slowly rise back up under the leadership of the new president. I already addressed the point of the Trustees working with him and the role of the president leading the campaign. We seem to have a basic disagreement about language. For example, if I say that President Richard Nixon was responsible for opening U.S. trade with China, or if I say President Reagan helped end the Cold War, neither of these statements implies that only Nixon and only Reagan single-handedly did these things. However, it does imply that they led their respective campaigns (whether you agree with these examples or not). In any case, it looks like ALT0d was created to address your concerns specifically.
Do you have a problem with that hook? Viriditas (talk) 08:19, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Comment: Because the question will likely be raised, we've featured artistic nudity above the waist on the front page before; see Female Figure (Giambologna), Feast of the Gods (art), nude study in autochrome by Arnold Genthe. The image is appropriately tame by modern standards, but evidently not the 1910s'!

This is not a review, but perhaps the greater concern here for DYK purposes is if it really is the "first Chinese literary magazine for women". That is a "first" hook, and per WP:DYKHOOKCITE, such superlative claims require exceptional sourcing (and ideally a search for possible counterexamples), since ERRORS might throw a fit if it turns out to be false. One solution could be to change "the first" to simply "a", but admittedly that might lessen the hook's punch. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 23:48, 7 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

The article meets the newness and length requirements. I did not find any close paraphrasing. A full QPQ has been completed. The hooks are cited inline and verified in the sources; admittedly, the article uses a referencing that is atypical from what I am used to, but that is not an issue for DYK purposes.
My preferences are ALT1 and ALT2, but they both cannot be approved as currently written: ALT1 could be reworded to make it "hookier" or "exciting", if you know what I mean (i.e. the searching for the rum tunnel could be reworded somewhat). ALT2 is technically correct according to the source, but also inaccurate and also not directly stated in the article. The article does not exactly say that the demolition was "announced to attract potential buyers", at least not directly. It might be better to reword the hook as saying that, to attract buyers, they put out a notice claiming it would be demolished (even though they had no plans of doing so, and could not do it anyway). It would be more accurate to the source too. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 05:54, 5 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hi Narutolovehinata5. As much as I'd love to paint a picture of him crawling on his hands and knees searching a dusty old cellar for a tunnel, the source doesn't support it. It simply says that he spent hours searching for the rumoured tunnel with his sister and friends. As for ALT2, omitting context while still reflecting the source is a common practice in writing hooks, and adding that it was impossible for them to legally demolish the structure actually detracts the hookiness (which is strange, given your concerns about ALT1). The fact that this video was meant to attract buyers is already clear from its the phrase "one video", which links the hook sentence with the previous one, and the video is also mentioned (in less detail) in that sentence's source which makes the collocation clear.
To put it bluntly, I'm done with peopling for now, so I'll withdraw this nomination.  — Chris Woodrich (talk) 10:52, 5 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Crisco 1492: Well, I did not mean to say that the "they aren't allowed to demolish it" fact should be included in ALT2, but rather that it should just be rephrased to make it a bit more obvious that demolishing was never actually on the cards. Something like "to attract buyers, X claimed that the Devonshire Lodge would be demolished?" Not that exact wording, of course, but moreso the thought.

Date, size, other spotchecks ok, but new hook is needed - or this one should be revised, as the current wording suggests the article is about Rāgarāja while in fact it is about the Seated Rāgarāja (Nara National Museum). This is a too easter-eggy I fear. I think the ALT1 below would work, if the nom agrees. Please ping me if replying here. --Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus| reply here 14:36, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Comment: I recently created the articles about Vickers on de.wikipedia and en.wikipedia, and learned that he is a specialist in Italian operas, who ironically sang Bizet's French opera Carmen as his first opera in Europe, in Italy of all places. His first performance in Germany was also in French, in Offenbach's Les contes d'Hoffmann, but I thought that singing French in Italy would be a better hook, without mentioning the second time that happened. (He actually did sing in Italian in Italy just days after his debut in French!)

The article was converted from a redirect within seven days of creation and also meets the length requirements. Most of the article is properly sourced, although the "Video" and "Awards" sections need a reference. As the nominator has no prior nominations, no QPQ is needed here. The hook is cited inline and verified; however, given how Carmen is one of the world's most famous operas, I do not see how him performing Carmen is by itself interesting to a broad audience, so a different hook angle may be needed here. As this is an opera article, I am requesting help from 4meter4 regarding possible hook suggestions, as well as to give advice to the nominator regarding DYK. I also see that the nominator is largely inactive on the English Wikipedia and has not edited since the 10th, so if they are unable to return, I am also inviting 4meter4 to adopt the nomination. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 08:51, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Narutolovehinata5: I think you might have missed the point of the hook. The singer specializes in the Italian language repertory and it was therefore ironic that his stage debut in Italy was not in an Italian language opera but in a French language one. That's what the nominator I think was trying to get at. Note that language is not the only thing that separates these operas because different approaches to singing and different styles and performance traditions developed in each country, so it isn't just a matter of singing in a different language. One has to learn the diverging styles and performance tradition associated with the rep as well. That said, it's not unusual for opera singers to specialize in a certain repertory (ie French opera, Italian opera, Russian opera, Czech opera, German opera, etc.) but on occasion go outside that into another area of opera. Most singers won't stay entirely in a single repertoire during their career; partly because a more diverse repertoire keeps them employed, and partly because singers are often expected to tackle roles of varying kinds if they are a member of a repertory company. I wouldn't find this fact particularly unusual or surprising for that reason, and the subtlety of the hook might be missed. I'll give it a read and see if something else might be better. Best.4meter4 (talk) 14:13, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@4meter4: I was aware of that, the thought I had was that the language did not really matter because, as far as I am aware, it is common for opera performers to specialize in multiple operas of different origins. The context you gave might still be too specialist regardless, so this is probably not the best angle to go with anyway. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 14:17, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Narutolovehinata5: I think for people ignorant of opera (which is most people) they would find it surprising that someone known for singing in Italian would perform in French instead in Italy. It's the informed people like you and me that don't find it interesting. One would have to know opera singers are tackling different language rep routinely to find it boring. I'd be ok with this running for that reason since this is a DYK newbie if we can't come up with something better. Perhaps a covid-19 pandemic hook from the 75th anniversary of Opera Delaware? That's the only unusual thing that is really sticking out to me.4meter4 (talk) 14:25, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Honestly I'm not really a fan of COVID hooks as I feel like that's a horse that's been beaten to death on DYK. Perhaps you could find more information about him that could be added to the article? Maybe Viriditas also has some other ideas on possible hooks. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 14:38, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Narutolovehinata5 Honestly, I don't think we are going to do better. He's your typical principal tenor performing in the standard opera repertoire at respectable mainly second tier opera houses in Europe. There's nothing really unusual about his work, and he isn't a top star in the big houses but he is singing major roles in the next step down theaters. The coverage of him is largely in the context of reviews of individual operas. Only one of the sources is specifically about him and his career, and it is behind a paywall which I can't access. I kind of doubt there is going to be anything there but anything is possible. Respectfully, I think we've highlighted the only two possibilities in this discussion. I do think you should weigh the need to support a first time nominator in the decision process, and not be too picky/demanding. It's not like this is a routine contributor throwing up the same problematic hooks (no name dropping required). We can run another covid hook; particularly in support of a first time nominator.4meter4 (talk) 15:08, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I mean if there's coverage out there about his personal life that could be added to the article. If there really isn't anything more we can do, we could discuss the COVID angle depending on how it's worded, and then present ALT0 and that ALT1 to further discussion by other editors to see their DYKINT compliance. I'm also still waiting for Viriditas to provide advice given they've been helpful in previous opera nominations. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 23:14, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Thank you for taking the time to consider my nomination! I found it amusing that a tenor who focused on Italian repertoire made his debut in Italy singing in French, and I won't be upset if that's not enough for a DYK. I found additional material about Vickers' life (especially during the pandemic) in video interviews and social media that would make for a very interesting article, but due to the nature of the sources, I did not use that. I added references to the Video and Awards sections now. They had been in the de.wikipedia article, I must have missed them. Perhaps a shorter version of the hook would be better to take the focus off Carmen, that's not the funny part after all – "DYK ... that Matthew Vickers, who specialised in Italian opera, made his debut in Italy singing in French?"

Comment: If the first hook is too close to containing weasal words, then the alt hook would be acceptable (still prefer the main hook as it is more closely tied to article subject), but the source cited uses the same language so I think it is fine.

If there are concerns about the presentability of that stub, maybe "chandelle" could be replaced with "a climbing turn"?
QPQ: Done.
Overall:
I'm concerned about the incomplete list per WP:DYKCOMPLETE. I also think it's needs a short section before the hazard explanation giving a thorough definition of a box canyon and why they're of interest in aviation (why would a pilot willingly fly in a box canyon in the first place?), as of right now to the extent the article has that information it's only in the lede. Adding this would resolve any MOS:LEADREL and MOS:LEDECITE issues. Once those fixes are complete should be good to go. This isn't a requirement, but it would also be nice to see some explanation to why a chandelle is not the preferred maneuever, as well as why the recommended maneuever is not simply a climb, which also seems intuitive. 🌸⁠wasianpower⁠🌸 (talk • contribs) 19:53, 20 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Seasons of Change
( Comment or viewArticle history )
... that "Seasons of Change" was written by Blackfeather members, Neale Johns and John Robinson. It was recorded with help from local group Fraternity's John Bisset and Bon Scott. Robinson promised Scott that Blackfeather would not release the song as a single. Fraternity issued their rendition in March 1971 in Adelaide. When it appeared on local charts, label boss, David Sinclair reneged on that promise and released Blackfeather's version as a single in direct competition?

Comment: Hello Cory, this is still in violation of WP:DYKFICTION. I might not have been clear enough before. Burke is a fictional character, meaning aspects of his (fictional) biography are not eligible for DYK.
Here are some theoretical hooks that could be DYKs if they were true (just examples, not true):
FAKEALT0 ... that Thomas Burke has been used as a protest symbol in Madagascar? (Connected to theoretical real world events)
FAKEALT1 ... that Emily Blunt conceived of Thomas Burke on a bike ride and suggested it to Final Destination writers? (Connected to theoretical real circumstances of how the character was conceived of in the real world)
FAKEALT2 ... that GQ Magazine called Thomas Burke a "home movie icon"? (Connected to a theoretical real review)
These are fake facts (don't use them!), but examples of what would be acceptable for a fictional character on DYK. Bremps... 22:02, 20 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Cited:
Interesting:
- Neither of these hooks are particularly interesting. The first stands out as rather obvious and badly written; and the second contains so little detail that nothing about it hooks me. Reading through the article, there's no shortage of interesting factoids to hook the average reader into learning more (i.e. explosive rats, D-Day sabotage, rescuing Jewish prisoners, Soviet partisan activity, its influence on Cold War-era irregular warfare, etc.)
QPQ: Done.
Overall:
Article was created on 14 September 2025 and is currently 2,655 words (18,582 characters) in length. It is fully sourced, neutral and free of plagiarism (per Earwig results). Its hooks are cited, but not remotely interesting. QPQ is done. This nomination needs more interesting hooks before I can approve it. Aside from DYK criteria, the lead sentence could be improved per the Manual of Style (see MOS:REFERS). Grnrchst (talk) 09:29, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Just one issue I found, in the second paragraph of "racing career" the first three sentences don't have a citation, the fourth is about his 2004 Le Mans race and the two citations there appear to only deal with Le Mans.

~~ AirshipJungleman29 (talk) 10:08, 16 September 2025 (UTC).[reply]
I have an issue with ALT0. Surely your sources say that such a practice exists, but the only statistical data shows it is a small minority of all marriages which themselves are of unknown prevalence. Seems unsupported to claim that "often" Vietnamese people are engaged in bride kidnapping. Likewise, the "many" in ALT1 refers to the Vietnamese women who live in China, not all Vietnamese women. Also, it seems like the Chinese government is trying "to end the cross-border marriage system", of which the vast majority is voluntary, not just "bride trafficking".

"Villagers in rural China have expressed a lack of concern towards the practice, citing social, physical, and economic difficulties faced by the men who purchase the kidnapped women." this sentence in the lead does not do a good job summarizing local attitudes in the body of the article.
" Illegal crossings and undocumented transnational marriages in the Sino-Vietnamese border areas have occurred since ancient times, as the border can be crossed with relative ease" did the concept of illegal immigration even exist in ancient times?
Who knows, but that's what the cited source says.
"In the early 2020s, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the border fortifications created by China in response, the flow of trafficked women across the Sino-Vietnamese border largely ceased." Presumably this applies to voluntary as well as involuntary migration?
From what I can see, the cited source did not venture an opinion.

Surely you are capable of finding the parts of the article and summarizing them in lead. The overall attitude towards unauthorized marriages appears to be significantly more positive than the lead would suggest. (t · c) buidhe 16:17, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Buidhe, I think the lead fairly summarises the article. That the villagers are unconcerned by the practice is clearly evident from the third pargraph of "Trafficking"—they do not have strong positive or negative feelings. See also the second paragraph of "Views"—"the 17 women who reported having been kidnapped did not avoid providing such a sensitive response...they had no need to conceal these facts, as such marriages were already widely known in the villages and not regarded as serious crimes to be reported". ~~ AirshipJungleman29 (talk) 16:27, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The article has the following about villagers' attitude towards the marriages:
Extended content
"Villagers interviewed also indicated that marriage is an economic strategy: men receive a new source of labor through their children and can be supported by their children and wives in old age. In China, children are both culturally and legally obligated to support their parents. The villagers expressed concern over unmarried men, who will be economically disadvantaged. Many of them did not view the men who purchase trafficked Vietnamese women as evil, but instead as economically and socially disadvantaged. Multiple interviewees, including some of the trafficked wives themselves, explained that the men who purchased them were often poor or physically (in one case, neurologically) disabled"—also found WP:CLOP from [43]
"villagers rarely report instances of trafficking"—this appears to incorrectly refer to all migration as trafficking, based on context. WP:VER issue
and the whole "Views" section, 2 paragraphs that are not really summarized in the lead
The only mention in the lead of villagers' opinions is about trafficked wives, which according to the article is only 6.2% of the total. I don't think that's appropriate,
and there are other specific issues found (see collapsed above). The lack of concern, according to the article, isn't just about kidnapped women but all illegal marriages, which are tolerated and rarely reported to the authorities. (t · c) buidhe 06:37, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hi An anonymous username, not my real name, buidhe has raised some concerns regarding WP:NPOV and WP:V above, do you think you can sort them out? ~~ AirshipJungleman29 (talk) 10:20, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
buidhe, as respectfully as possible, I must ask if you actually read source 1. It was also not necessary to conceal the facts of trafficking as these were known in the villages. Bridal kidnappings were not considered serious crimes that should be reported. And I don't think it's UNDUE to provide an explanation as to why trafficking persists despite its obvious illegality (villagers not being concerned by it). Sources are (unsurprisingly, if I may say) more interested in discussing views on trafficking than views on consensual marriage. For the most part, these marriages are discussed as either explicitly a result of trafficking or with ambiguity as to whether they were a result of trafficking or consensual (and in the latter cases I have done my best to not make the wording wrongly suggest they were specifically either). Also, most of the "Views" section is focused on views on trafficking, which you seem to feel has already been given too much weight as is. The only thing I will grant you is that the phrase "villagers rarely report instances of trafficking" isn't placed in the most appropriate location and could probably be removed altogether given that this same fact is shared in more detail later on. Lastly, I'd like to point out that I'm semi-active at this point and don't really care whether or not this article makes DYK. It was already passed as a good article, so unless you'd like to contest that, the outcome of this discussion means little to me. — Anonymous 13:52, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

But, according to the company, this winter has been relatively mild and weather conditions have shifted often and rapidly, adding complications to the process of constructing the road. With northern parts of Russia historically experiencing temperatures below -67°F (-55°C), the road typically goes into service from February until April, meandering along the frozen beds of the Eigi and Adycha rivers. It is the only ground-based transportation access to the mine, located 700 km from the nearest town; the rest of the year the mine can be reached only by helicopter. The road
is used to transport ore and to supply the mine with diesel fuel and other materials necessary for the next production season." from page 139 of : "Logistical Solutions for Remote Sites: Meeting the Need for Access, Comfort and Convenience". Engineering & Mining Journal: 138–141. April 2013.

Source: "When Bishop’s confinement became broadly known, thousands of his ardent supporters marched on his home on 19 October and set him free. Bishop next led the crowd to bloodlessly seize control of Fort Rupert, the island’s military headquarters. Other Grenadian regular Army soldiers loyal to the Coard faction then were dispatched in three armored vehicles to retake the fort and recapture Bishop. Shooting started when the soldiers faced off with Bishop’s supporters at the fort’s entrance. Three soldiers and at least eight civilians were killed in the ensuing melee and panic that also injured about 100 other civilians.
The surviving soldiers captured Bishop, three of his ministers, and four other loyal supporters and led them away to a walled courtyard. Shortly after, the eight were executed in cold blood by a firing squad of soldiers who (according to subsequent court testimony) declared they were acting under the orders of the Central Committee" from: Kukielski, Philip G.
