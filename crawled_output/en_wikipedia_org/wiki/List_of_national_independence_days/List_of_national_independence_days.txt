For patriotic days not necessarily linked to independence, see National day.
Independence-related national day   Unification- or revolution-related national day   Other reasons for national day   No official national day
An independence day is an annual event commemorating the anniversary of a nation's independence or statehood, usually after ceasing to be a group or part of another nation or state, or after the end of a military occupation, or after a major change in government. Many countries commemorate their independence from a colonial empire.
Not all countries mark independence as a national holiday. Many, such as Australia, Canada, China, Denmark, France,[1] New Zealand, Ireland, Luxembourg, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Taiwan, and Turkey mark other dates of significance.

The newly established Bogd Khanate of Mongolia led by the Bogd Khan lasted for 8 years until it was occupied by the Republic of China in 1919, to regain independence not long after.The Imperial Edict of the Abdication of the Qing Emperor issued in 1912 provided the legal basis for the Republic of China to inherit all Qing territories, including Mongolia.[86][87][88] The Republic of China later established de facto control over Mongolia in 1919. Mongolia subsequently re-asserted its independence in 1921. During the years of socialism, the value of this historically important day was ignored, but the law of the State Greate Khural of the Republic of Mongolia on August 16, 2007, made December 29 a public holiday, and later enshrined it into law on December 23, 2011, making it a public holiday, the Day of the Restoration of National Freedom and Independence.

^ In 1962, President Diosdado Macapagal signed a proclamation which declared Tuesday, 12 June 1962 as a special public holiday in commemoration of the declaration of independence from Spain on that date in 1898. That proclamation did not move the date of the Independence Day holiday in the Philippines.[99] The date of the holiday was moved in 1964, with the signing of Republic Act No. 4166.[100]

^ The country's original independence (from the Kingdom of León) occurred on 24 June 1128 (Battle of São Mamede) and was recognized on 5 October 1143. That day is a holiday in Portugal, but for a different reason. (Implantation of the Republic, or Republic Day. Event of 1910.) Note that none of these events is similar to today's declarations or recognition of independence as these are in fact the recognition of the rule of a king to the land. Portugal existed as a separate entity before 1143 and during the union with Spain between 1580 and 1640.
