Three additional seasons followed before the series concluded on May 14, 2009. The series was unexpectedly cancelled, ending on a cliffhanger.

After he wins the jackpot on a lottery scratcher, Earl celebrates and is struck by a vehicle in a hit-and-run collision. While in the hospital, he discovers the concept of karma and decides to make a list of his bad deeds. He uses his lottery winnings to make up for them by helping the people he wronged. (Full list...)

The Kuk Early Agricultural Site documents New Guinea's independent development of agriculture.
Papua New Guinea has designated a number of areas as potential UNESCO World Heritage Sites. These sites cover areas of both cultural and natural significance. Only one, the Kuk Early Agricultural Site, has become inscribed as an official site. Archaeology at this site has found evidence of the independent development of agriculture on the island of New Guinea. The other listings remain tentative. Many of these sites were selected following foreign proposals, and while they have national government support, there has been little or no progress towards the protections needed to lodge official nominations since the sites were tentatively listed in 2006. Due to the political power of local communities in the country, any successful nomination would require local support and cooperation. The nomination of this site was made with support from the Kawelka people, who continue to carry out traditional land-use practices at the site. (Full list...)

Side-by-side of insect species from 15 different orders
Insecta is a class of invertebrates that consists of around 30 individual orders. Orders are the fifth taxonomic rank used to classify living organisms, below the rank of class, but above the rank of family. With around 1 million insect species having been formally described and assigned a binomial name, insects are the most diverse group of animals, comprising approximately half of extant species on Earth. The total insect biodiversity has been estimated at around 6 million species. The most diverse orders are Coleoptera (beetles), Hymenoptera (wasps, bees, ants and sawflies), Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths), Diptera (flies) and Hemiptera (true bugs).Taxonomists disagree on the exact number of orders, with opinions ranging from 26 to 32 distinct extant orders.

Legislative Assembly House, Aizawl, Mizoram,
There are 40 constituencies of the Mizoram Legislative Assembly, the unicameral legislature of Mizoram state in Northeast India. The seat of the legislative assembly (pictured) is at Aizawl, the capital of the state. The assembly's 40 members are directly elected from single-seat constituencies and sit for a term of five years, unless it is dissolved early. Mizoram is the fourth-smallest state in India; and the second-least populous state with a population of 1.10 million. Since the independence of India, the Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST) have been given reservation status, guaranteeing political representation, and the Constitution lays down the general principles of positive discrimination for STs and SCs. The 2011 census of India stated that the indigenous population constitutes 95% of the state's total population. The STs have been granted a reservation of 39 seats in the Mizoram assembly, leaving only one (Aizawl East-I) unreserved. (Full list...)
