Alison Louise Hume[1] is a British Labour Party politician and television writer who has been Member of Parliament (MP) for Scarborough and Whitby since 2024. In television she is known for her work as creator and executive producer of the CBBC series The Sparticle Mystery and the BBC drama Rocket Man.
Early life[edit]
Hume was born in Bushey[citation needed] and grew up in Essex, with her father, an accountant, being originally from York.[2] She moved back to Yorkshire with her parents, when they retired, moving to Poppleton.[2]
Writing[edit]
Hume attended the Northern Film School and trained on a Carlton new writers' course.[3] She worked as a television and film screenwriter, writing among others, the 2003 feature film Pure,[4] and the 2005
TV movie Beaten.[5] She had her own production company, through which produced the CBBC shows Summerhill and The Sparticle Mystery, both of which she wrote.[6][7]
Politics[edit]
Following her second son being born with a rare chromosomal disorder, Hume became a disability rights campaigner, eventually co founding York Accessibility Action. It was through her activism that she entered formal politics.[2][8] At the 2019 European Parliament election, Hume stood as a candidate for the Labour Party in the Yorkshire and the Humber constituency.[9][10] In 2019 she unsuccessfully stood to be the Labour candidate for Rother Valley[11] Hume was also a candidate in the 2021 election for the North Yorkshire Police, Fire and Crime Commissioner.[12] In 2023, she was selected as the Labour Party candidate for Scarborough and Whitby at the 2024 general election, a contest that she won with a majority of over 5,000.[13][14]
