2002 (MMII) was a common year starting on Tuesday of the Gregorian calendar, the 2002nd year of the Common Era (CE) and Anno Domini (AD) designations, the 2nd
year of the 3rd millennium and the 21st century, and the
3rd
year of the 2000s decade. Calendar year The effects of the September 11 attacks of the previous year had a significant impact on the affairs of 2002. The war on terror was a major political focus. Without settled international law, several nations engaged in anti-terror operations, and human rights concerns arose surrounding the treatment of suspected terrorists. Elsewhere, the Colombian conflict and the Nepalese Civil War represented some of the most severe militant conflicts, while the conflict between India and Pakistan was the only one between two sovereign nations. Religious tensions permeated the year, including violence between Hindus and Muslims in India during violent riots and other attacks and attacks on Jews in response to the Second Intifada. The Catholic Church grappled with scrutiny amid sexual abuse cases.
Timor-Leste was established as a new sovereign nation, and the African Union began operating as a new intergovernmental organization. The International Criminal Court was founded in July. The global economy was stagnant as it slowly moved past the early 2000s recession. South America endured an economic crisis, and the telecommunications and information technology industries faced their own economic declines. The Euro was introduced as a new currency at the beginning of the year.
The year 2002 was the second hottest on record at the time. Eruptions of Mount Nyiragongo severely affected surrounding populations in central Africa. The discovery of Quaoar in October challenged the conventional definition of a planet. Small RNA was discovered in 2002, and the human ancestor Sahelanthropus was first described.
Norway won the most gold medals in the 2002 Winter Olympics, which were held in Salt Lake City. The popular film franchises Harry Potter and The Lord of the Rings saw continued success, with The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers becoming the highest grossing film of the year, while James Bond and Star Wars were less successful than other franchise installments. Pop music lost its popularity in 2002 amid the rise of country and hip hop, with hip hop artist Eminem producing the year's most successful album, The Eminem Show.
Population[edit]
The world population on January 1, 2002, was estimated to be 6.272 billion people, and it increased to 6.353 billion people by January 1, 2003.[1] An estimated 134.0 million births and 52.5 million deaths took place in 2002.[1] The average global life expectancy was 67.1 years, an increase of 0.3 years from 2001.[1] The number of global refugees was approximately 12 million at the beginning of 2002, but it declined to 10.3 million by the end of the year. Approximately 2.4 million refugees were repatriated in 2002, of which 2 million were Afghan. 293,000 additional refugees were displaced in 2002, primarily from Liberia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burundi, Somalia, Ivory Coast, and the Central African Republic.[2]
Conflicts[edit]
Further information: Category:Conflicts in 2002
There were 31 armed conflicts in 2002 that caused at least 25 fatalities. Five of these resulted in at least 1,000 fatalities: the Burundian Civil War, the Colombian conflict, the Kashmir insurgency, the Nepalese Civil War, and the Second Sudanese Civil War.[3] Among developed nations in 2002, national defense shifted toward counterterrorism after the September 11 attacks and the invasion of Afghanistan the previous year. Conflicts in Afghanistan, Chechnya, Israel, and the Philippines were directly related to countering Islamic terrorism.[4]: 87
Internal conflicts[edit]
The Colombian conflict escalated after far-left insurgents occupied demilitarized zones and kidnapped Íngrid Betancourt, effectively ending peace talks. The insurgents began bombing cities, and over 200,000 Colombians were displaced by the conflict in 2002.[4]: 91–92
The Nepalese Civil War escalated in 2002, with casualties approximately equaling the combined totals from 1996 to 2001; half of this increase was civilian casualties, as civilians were targeted by both the Nepali government and the communist insurgents.[4]: 88–89  Chechen insurgents in Russia escalated their attacks during the Second Chechen War, destroying a Russian Mil Mi-26 in August and causing a hostage crisis in Moscow.[4]: 93–94  The Second Liberian Civil War also escalated, causing widespread displacement of civilians.[5]: 90
Conflicts that saw some form of resolution in 2002 include the Eelam War III in Sri Lanka, which was halted with a ceasefire agreement in February,[4]: 98  and the Angolan Civil War, which was resolved in April with a ceasefire between the Angolan government and UNITA.[5]: 89  Internationally brokered peace talks advanced in the Second Sudanese Civil War,[4]: 102  some factions of the Somali Civil War,[4]: 106  and the Second Congo War, with the latter producing an agreement on December 17 to create a Congolese transitional government.[4]: 100–101  Afghanistan underwent its first year without direct military conflict in over two decades, though sporadic attacks were carried out by the Taliban insurgency and al-Qaeda.[5]: 256  An agreement was reached with the government of Burundi and the CNDD-FDD on December 3, but the other major faction in Burundi, the Palipehutu-FNL, did not participate in peace talks.[3]
The largest attack on civilians in 2002 was a series of bombings in Bali that killed or injured hundreds on October 12, with Australian tourists making up a large portion of the victims.[6]: 228  Major attacks also took place in Kenya on November 28, bombing Israeli citizens at a hotel and making a failed attempt to shoot down an airplane boarded by Israelis.[7]: 385  The Washington D.C. area was the subject of several sniper attacks the same month, killing ten people. Europe underwent a large number of mass shootings throughout the year, including an attack on a town council meeting in France on March 27 that killed eight councilors and a school shooting in Germany on April 26—one of the deadliest in the world with 18 fatalities.[6]: 229
International conflicts[edit]
The Israel Defense Forces occupying the West Bank during Operation Defensive Shield
The only direct conflict between nations in 2002 was the India–Pakistan standoff in Kashmir,[3] beginning in late 2001. This conflict was primarily one of brinkmanship, with the threat of nuclear warfare.[4]: 88  Riots in Gujarat and suicide bombings in Jammu further escalated tensions.[8]: 87
The Second Intifada continued in 2002 between the Israel Defense Forces and Palestinian paramilitary groups with an escalation in violence. Palestinian suicide bombings became coordinated to maximize the number of civilian casualties, while the Israeli military killed approximately twice as many Palestinians in retaliation.[8]: 73  In response to the suicide bombings, Israel carried out Operation Defensive Shield in March.[5]: 413  Under this operation, Israel occupied much of West Bank,[5]: 413  and it and briefly held Palestinian president Yasser Arafat under house arrest.[4]: 95  The Battle of Jenin was particularly destructive, with the United Nations finding both parties to be irresponsible regarding collateral damage.[4]: 96
Culture[edit]
Art and architecture[edit]
Main articles: 2002 in art and 2002 in architecture
Construction of the Bibliotheca Alexandrina was completed in 2002.
Economic downturn in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks limited the art industry in 2002. Organizations were less willing to give patronage, and tourists were less willing to visit art exhibitions and museums, particularly in New York and the Middle East.[7]: 502  The Documenta11 exhibition took place in Kassel, Germany, contributing to the early movement of art globalization with its focus on experimental and documentary works from developing nations. Traditional visual art was mostly replaced by film and photography at the exhibition.[7]: 503 [9] Critically acclaimed paintings in 2002 include The Upper Room, a collection of paintings by Chris Ofili based on a drawing of a monkey by Andy Warhol,[10] and Dispersion, an abstract work by Julie Mehretu.[11]
The rebuilding of the World Trade Center was a major focus in the architectural world, and various exhibitions were held to showcase design concepts. The Tribute in Light was implemented on the site during the interim.[6]: 155  Egypt began accepting designs for the Grand Egyptian Museum.[6]: 234  New structures constructed or opened in 2002 include the Austrian Cultural Forum in New York, the Imperial War Museum North in Manchester,[6]: 156  the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels in Los Angeles, and the Bibliotheca Alexandrina in Alexandria.[7]: 506  The Bronx Developmental Center in New York and Fallingwater in Pennsylvania were renovated, and the Maslon House was demolished in California.[6]: 157
Media[edit]
Main articles: 2002 in film, 2002 in music, 2002 in radio, and 2002 in video games
Popular media[edit]
Eminem released the best-selling album of 2002, The Eminem Show.
The highest-grossing film globally in 2002 was The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, followed by Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets and Spider-Man. The highest-grossing non-English film was Hero (Mandarin), the 28th highest-grossing film of the year.[12] Film was marked by several unexpected successes and failures in 2002, including the underwhelming performances of the Star Wars film Attack of the Clones, the James Bond film Die Another Day, and the Disney film Treasure Planet, as well as the word-of-mouth success of My Big Fat Greek Wedding.[13] Critically acclaimed films from 2002 include Adaptation,[14][15][16] Far from Heaven,[15][16][17] and Talk to Her.[15][16][17]
Music sales in 2002 amounted to about 3 billion units, a decline of 8% from 2001. CD albums remained the dominant form of music, making up 89% of the market. DVD music sales increased by 40%, while cassette tape music sales decreased by 36%.[18] Pop music saw a major decline in 2002 as it was overtaken by country and hip hop music.[19] Globally, the best-selling albums in 2002 were The Eminem Show by Eminem, followed by Let Go by Avril Lavigne and the Elvis Presley greatest hits album ELV1S: 30 #1 Hits. The best-selling non-English album was Mensch (transl. Human) by German singer Herbert Grönemeyer, the 29th best-selling album overall.[20]
Sony and Microsoft introduced online gaming services for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox consoles, respectively.[6]: 174  Critically acclaimed video games released in 2002 include Eternal Darkness, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, Metroid Prime, Metroid Fusion, and Super Mario Sunshine.[21][22][23] Medal of Honor: Allied Assault was influential in the war-based first-person shooter genre with its portrayal of grand cinematic battles. 2002 was the final year of traditional survival horror before it was overtaken by action-based survival horror games in franchises such as Resident Evil.[24]
Libraries, press, and radio[edit]
Costa Rica was celebrated for an advance in free speech when it abolished criminal penalties for insulting public officials.[6]: 275  Radio in India became more popular in 2002 following deregulation, with five major stations in Mumbai breaking the state monopoly in April and with significant increases in the sales of car and pocket radios. Good Morning Afghanistan began airing to provide the Afghan people real-time updates on the nation's political situation, while Radio Liberty was expelled from Russia in October.[6]: 272  An expected recovery of the newspaper industry did not materialize in 2002 as digital media became more common, resulting in significant cutbacks.[6]: 273  The magazine industry faced similar challenges, as well as a separate controversy when the February 11 issue of Newsweek International was banned throughout the Muslim world for its depiction of Muhammed.[6]: 275
The British Library digitized a 700-year-old edition of the Quran, and the U.S. Library of Congress made high resolution scans of a Gutenberg Bible for closer study of Gutenberg's printing methods. Library services faced multiple disruptions in 2002. Strikes by librarians affected operations in both the United Kingdom and the United States, while funding shortages led to cutbacks in Germany, South Africa, and the United States.[6]: 233
Sports[edit]
Main article: 2002 in sports
The 2002 Winter Olympics were held in Salt Lake City.
The 2002 Winter Olympics were held in Salt Lake City, with Norway winning the most gold medals. Allegations that a judge was bribed to favor Russia in a figure skating event led to France and Russia both receiving gold medals in the event.[7]: 515 [25] The 2002 Commonwealth Games were held in Manchester.[7]: 516  The 2002 FIFA World Cup was held in Japan and South Korea, and it ended with a 2–0 victory by Brazil over Germany. The traditionally well-performing teams of Argentina, France, and Italy did not meet expectations, while Senegal, South Korea, Turkey, and the United States performed better than they had historically.[7]: 513
Michael Schumacher significantly exceeded his competition and set numerous records with the Ferrari F2002 during the 2002 Formula One World Championship, prompting the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile to make several rule changes; this included reforms for team orders following a controversial move at the 2002 Austrian Grand Prix in which Schumacher's teammate Rubens Barrichello moved aside to let him win.[6]: 317  In boxing, the Lennox Lewis vs. Mike Tyson was preceded by a scuffle during a press conference. Lennox Lewis went on to defeat Mike Tyson.[7]: 520 [25] Tennis was widely covered in 2002 when three of the four Grand Slam tournaments ended with Serena Williams defeating her sister Venus Williams in the finals.[6]: 352  In American football, the Tuck Rule Game between the New England Patriots and the Oakland Raiders became a national controversy after officials cited the obscure tuck rule to challenge a pass by Tom Brady.[26] The New Zealand All Blacks received wide attention in rugby union for its victory in the 2002 Tri Nations Series, making a comeback performance following its losses in previous years.[6]: 340  Bruno Peyron set the record for the fastest circumnavigation by sailing in 2002, making the trip in 64 days.[7]: 521
Economy[edit]

The Euro became the official currency of the European Union on January 1, 2002.
International trade increased by 1.9% in 2002, recovering from a decrease in 2001.[27]: 11  Most countries experienced only limited growth of output and employment in the year, and economic policy within the largest economies focused primarily on combating inflation.[27]: 1  The gross world product increased by 1.7%, the second lowest growth in a decade after that of 2001.[27]: 2  Most developed nations began 2002 in a budget surplus and ended in a deficit.[27]: 8  The Euro, a single official currency for the nations of the European Union, was introduced on January 1.[7]: 6
The early 2000s recession began to stabilize in the final months of the year.[27]: 1  Growth was focused in the first half of the year before tapering in the second half[27]: 35  as stock markets entered into a downturn.[28] By October, global equities saw a 24% decrease in 2002.[6]: 185  Particularly affected was AOL-Time Warner, with its stocks losing 65% of their value by the fall.[8]: 100  The information technology industry in particular saw major decline in 2002[6]: 170  before it began its recovery from the dot-com crash that had previously affected it.[7]: 458  The telecommunications industry was affected even more severely.[6]: 176
The price drops associated with the September 11 attacks persisted for several months into 2002.[27]: 7  Apprehensions about potential military conflict in Iraq also limited growth.[6]: 185  Latin American economies with large deficits were severely affected by lower prices, limiting export growth and preventing capital from entering the region, requiring further increases to the deficit.[27]: 3  The region overall saw a negative GDP in 2002.[27]: 4  Imports grew significantly in East Asia, with China competing with the United States as one of the largest export markets for other countries in the region.[27]: 12  Imports in Latin America and Africa decreased compared to the previous year.[27]: 13
The United States recovered in part from the recession that had affected the Western world, while Europe's recovery was more limited.[7]: 10  South America saw significant economic challenges: Argentina's economic crisis continued from 2001, Brazil had low confidence in its economy, and Venezuela's economy suffered amid political upheaval.[7]: 13  Unlike the Western world, Eastern Europe and Asia showed strong growth in 2002.[7]: 11  Africa did not share this growth, as it also experienced a weak economy during the year.[7]: 14
Several companies, predominantly in the United States, underwent major scandals in 2002. These included the WorldCom scandal that led to what was then the largest bankruptcy in American history, and accounting scandals emerging from the previous year's Enron scandal.[28]: 92–93  Xerox and the French company Vivendi were found to be reporting artificially inflated profits.[6]: 186  Others incidents included the ImClone stock trading case and fraud cases at Adelphia and Tyco. These scandals brought the arrests of several high-profile executives,[8] negatively affected public trust in corporate accounting,[6]: 185  and increased the volatility of global stock markets.[6]: 186

Typhoon Rusa on August 27
2002 was the second hottest year on record, exceeded only by 1998.[29] There was below average precipitation in 2002, with droughts in Australia, northern China, India, and Western United States.[29] Heavy rains in late 2002 caused significant flooding in eastern Asia[29] and in central Europe.[8]: 77  The effects of the Asian brown cloud were documented in August by the United Nations Environment Programme, warning of severe agricultural and meteorological effects in Afghanistan, northwestern India, and Pakistan.[6]: 184  February saw the collapse of the Larsen B ice shelf, a 12,000-year-old ice shelf in Antarctica with an area of 3,265 km2 (1,260 sq mi).[6]: 387
The third Global Environment Outlook report was published in May.[7]: 465  The World Summit on Sustainable Development was held in Johannesburg beginning on August 26. A number of proposals were endorsed in the summit, though environmentalists criticized the United States for not supporting stronger measures.[6]: 209  The European Union ratified the Kyoto Protocol, while China and Russia announced their intent to do so. Australia and the United States rejected the protocol.[6]: 211  The war in Afghanistan caused widespread environmental issues, with forests destroyed, wildlife poached by refugees,[6]: 213  and the Kabul Zoo requiring international support.[6]: 215  Kitulo National Park was established in Tanzania to preserve the endemic orchid species.[6]: 239
Efforts to promote carbon sequestration were mixed in 2002. An experiment to study whether there were risks of pollution was shuttered following pressure from environmentalist groups such as Greenpeace and the World Wide Fund for Nature, but Statoil reported success in a six-year-long experiment in the North Sea later in the year.[6]: 212
The January eruption of Mount Nyiragongo brought destruction to Goma, prompting an evacuation of 400,000 people, with 12,000 finding themselves homeless with damage across 14 villages.[6]: 182  A major oil spill took place off the coast of Galicia, Spain, when the MV Prestige ruptured and sank in November.[8]: 87  The deadliest earthquake in 2002 was a 6.1-magnitude earthquake that struck northern Afghanistan on March 25, killing approximately 1,000 people.[30] A 6.5 magnitude earthquake in Iran killed approximately 200 people the following June.[6]: 182  North America saw one of its most intense earthquakes when a 7.9 magnitude earthquake struck Alaska on November 3, but the remote location prevented any fatalities.[6]: 181
The 2002 Atlantic hurricane season saw 12 named storms, a near-average number. Most of them were relatively minor, with only 4 four becoming hurricanes, of which two attained major hurricane status. The season's activity was limited to between July and October, a rare occurrence caused partly by El Niño conditions. The two major hurricanes, Hurricane Isidore and Hurricane Lili, both made landfall in Cuba and the United States, and combined were responsible for most of the season's damages and deaths.[31] The 2002 Pacific typhoon season entailed a typical number of typhoons, but they were above average in intensity with 46% of typhoons reaching "intense strength". Typhoon Rusa killed at least 113 people in South Korea, making it the nation's deadliest typhoon in 43 years.[32]

Main article: 2002 in politics
Hamid Karzai (right) is elected president of Afghanistan
East Timor became a sovereign nation in 2002.[7]: 1  It was one of two nations, along with Switzerland, to join the United Nations in September.[6]: 382  Brazil, Lesotho, and Senegal established democracy in 2002 through the acceptance of fair elections, while Bahrain and Kenya moved toward democracy through the strengthening of political institutions. Democracy was disestablished in Ivory Coast and Togo following mass political violence and unfair elections, respectively.[34]: 14
The United States was not reelected to its membership on the United Nations Commission on Human Rights for the first time.[6]: 381  Afghanistan underwent significant liberalization under a transitional government following end of major fighting in the War in Afghanistan, particularly in the capital of Kabul, though distant regions of the country remained oppressed by warlords.[34]: 15  Civil rights also increased following the end of conflicts in Angola, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Macedonia.[34]: 15–16  Turkey lessened its restrictions on the country's Kurdish population in 2002.[34]: 16  The majority of Gibraltar's population engaged in protests when the British government considered delivering partial control of the territory to Spain; this culminated with a referendum that rejected the move.[6]: 385

NATO established a diplomatic relationship with Russia through the NATO-Russia Council in May, and NATO announced seven new members in November: Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia. This expansion meant that NATO countries bordered Russia for the first time.[6]: 282  Russia and the United States signed the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty nuclear disarmament agreement in May, but the United States left the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty the following month, and Russia then left the START II treaty. The International Code of Conduct against Ballistic Missile Proliferation was signed by over 90 countries in November.[6]: 277
A wave of social pension reform took place in European nations, where Finland, France, Greece, Hungary, Lithuania, Russia, Slovakia, Spain, were all in various phases of implementation. Similar reforms occurred in Japan and Singapore.[6]: 309–311  Anti-globalization protests took place during the September World Bank–IMF meeting in Washington, D.C.[6]: 314
Crime and international law[edit]
The Rome Statute entered into force in July, establishing the International Criminal Court.[7]: 469  The International Court of Justice ruled in three cases: it ruled that diplomatic immunity applied to all crimes, including crimes against humanity, and it settled two territorial disputes, ruling in favor of Cameroon over Nigeria and in favor of Malaysia over Indonesia.[7]: 471–472  A lesser court was established by the United Nations in Sierra Leone to prosecute figures associated with the nation's civil war.[7]: 470  A ban on the use of child soldiers was established in international law in February.[6]: 381

War on terror[edit]
The first inmates arrive at Camp X-Ray in the Guantanamo Bay detention camp.
Terrorism dominated politics internationally in 2002, with both terrorist acts and attempts to declare groups as terrorist organizations being prevalent throughout the year. Islamic terrorism was widely seen as responsible for terrorist attacks throughout the year. In response, the United States began providing military assistance against terrorists in several countries as part of Operation Enduring Freedom.[7]: 2  International law regarding these actions had yet to be settled, and international organizations spent the year debating how action against terrorist groups should be carried out.[7]: 469
Pakistan arrested al-Qaeda operative Ramzi bin al-Shibh in September on suspicions of involvement in the September 11 attacks and extradited him to the United States. The United States arrested an addition fifteen suspects across several states for involvement in the preparation of future terrorist attacks.[6]: 228  Anti-terrorism actions by the United States, including the arbitrary arrest and deportation of non-citizens and indefinite detention of suspected terrorists captured in Afghanistan, were condemned as human rights violations.[6]: 314
American treatment of prisoners in the war on terror came under scrutiny, particularly in Camp X-Ray in the Guantanamo Bay detention camp.[6]: 232  China and Russia invoked anti-terrorism to take actions against their Uyghur and Chechen minorities, respectively.[6]: 315
Australia, Russia, and the United States all declared a right to preemptive strikes against foreign terrorist groups in 2002.[6]: 278  George W. Bush defined an "axis of evil" in an address in January, naming Iran, Iraq, and North Korea as foreign adversaries of the United States. Increasing tensions between Iraq and the United States became a major geopolitical issue in 2002 amid suspicions that Iraq had resumed its production of weapons of mass destruction. The United Nations delivered an ultimatum for Iraq to comply with weapons inspections in late 2002.[35] Because of this dispute, as well Hussein's involvement with terrorist groups amid the war on terror, an invasion of Iraq by the United States was widely expected.[8]: 66–71
Religion[edit]
Religious violence was prevalent in 2002. Hindu–Muslim relations were strained in India, most prominently by an attack on a Hindu train car in February that led to weeks of deadly riots in Gujarat. Unrest from the Second Intifada led to widespread attacks on Jews throughout the world, and Christians in Pakistan faced several attacks throughout the year.[6]: 301
The Catholic Church sexual abuse scandal continued from 2001; the church adopted rules on how to address sexual abuse allegations on January 8, and Pope John Paul II made his second papal statement on the matter on March 22.[7]: 448  The Catholic Church created four new Russian dioceses in February, resulting in protests by members of the Russian Orthodox Church.[6]: 302  Belarus made the Belarusian Orthodox Church into the state's legally recognized religion, curtailing practice of other religions.[7]: 449  The Church of England determined in July that divorcees could marry in the church. Then in December, the church saw its first leader in centuries from outside its own membership when the Welsh Rowan Williams was confirmed as Archbishop of Canterbury.[7]: 447
Islam grappled with the aftermath of the September 11 attacks in 2002, facing both the expansion of Islamic terrorism and of United States military action in combating it.[7]: 450  Orthodox Judaism was the subject of several disputes with the Israeli government throughout the year, including the exemption of Orthodox Jews from military service and recognition of non-Orthodox conversions in the population registry.[6]: 303
The relationship between religion and education shifted in several nations in 2002. The removal of the Taliban from power allowed girls to attend school in Afghanistan for the first time, and textbooks funded by the United States included images of women. Pakistan introduced a law to regulate Islamic madrasa schools under pressure from Western nations, but it saw backlash from the schools. State-funded faith schools became a polarizing issue when the government suggested increasing their number. The Supreme Court of the United States ruled that school vouchers allowed students to seek religious education.[6]: 204–205
