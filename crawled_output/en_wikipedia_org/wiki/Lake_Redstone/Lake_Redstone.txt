Lake Redstone is a reservoir formed by a dam on Big Creek near La Valle in northern Sauk County of Wisconsin, United States.[1] It was constructed by local lake builder Ike Isaacson in 1964. A county park exists on the south shore, including a beach and waterfall.[2]
The lake's surface area is approximately 650 acres (2.6 km2), with over 17 miles (27 km) of shoreline and 4½ miles long.
Lake Redstone has a 19,200-acre (78 km2) watershed to the north from Juneau County that fills the lake.
The dam is located at the south end and has a top draw spillway. All excess water creates a cascading waterfall and eventually flows into the Baraboo River.[3]
History[edit]
Construction of the lake was started in 1964 by Ike Issacson.[4] It was finished two years later, in 1966.[5]
Community[edit]
Lake Redstone has no mandatory owners association, but owners are encouraged to join the Lake Redstone Property Owners Association.[6]
