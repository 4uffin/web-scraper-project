Billboard Women in Music is an annual event held by Billboard. Its main award is titled Woman of the Year, established to recognize women in the music industry who have made significant contributions to the business and who, through their work and continued success, inspire generations of women to take on increasing responsibilities within the field, according to the magazine.[1]
Women in music include women as composers, songwriters, instrumental performers, singers, conductors, music scholars, music educators, music critics/music journalists, and in other musical professions. A songwriter is an individual who writes the lyrics, melodies and chord progressions for songs, typically for a popular music genre such as pop, rock, or country music. A songwriter can also be called a composer, although the latter term tends to be mainly used for individuals from the classical music genre.
Since 2023 Billboard established the first Billboard Latin Women in Music, focusing exclusively on female artists of Latin music.[2] Since 2024, it has expanded the award ceremony to the individual international territories in which the magazine is published.[3][4][5]
