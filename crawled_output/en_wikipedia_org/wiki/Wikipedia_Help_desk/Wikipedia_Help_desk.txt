Is myheritage a reliable source?[edit]
I personally do not think so but I was just wondering. I think it was covered at WP:RSP but i typed in WP:MYHERITAGE and manually check RSP and I couldn't find any results. It is used a bunch of Wikipedia pages (usually for minor things) so it might be important to reach consensus on its reliability 🇪🇭🇵🇸🇸🇩 Easternsahara 🇪🇭🇵🇸🇸🇩 04:53, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Easternsahara There was an earlier discussion you missed at WP:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard/Archive_231#myheritage.com pointing out that it is user-generated but sometimes mentions underlying sources that could be OK. Mike Turnbull (talk) 10:50, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I've redirected WP:MYHERITAGE to that discussion, for now.We could perhaps do with a FAQ page about such sites in general. Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 11:32, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I think it depends what you want to source:
"Abraham Lincoln was the first president to walk on the moon." If this is what you find on a family tree, which is user-generated, then it's not RS.
"David Lloyd George was at 10 Downing Street in June 1921, as per the 1921 census". In some cases, primary sources like the 1921 England & Wales census can be accessed via providers such as the sleeping giant myheritage, ancestry etc. The policy of The National Archives UK is to enter partnerships with these businesses, so they are the medium that provides this information digitally, from behind their paywall.
If there is acknowledgement that myheritage is the medium and not the original source, all well and good in my opinion.Keith H99 (talk) 12:33, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
In your second scenario, it is the census that is being cited, not MyHeriatge, or whichever site hosts it. Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 13:35, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I have started drafting a guideline at Wikipedia:Genealogy sources. Please feel free to chip in. Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 13:53, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Wiki Page Review Clarification[edit]
Hello,
I created an article recently and ensured that the article meets the Wikipedia standards. Some editors have also improved the article but it hasn't been approved till now.
What could be the cause please? Greatben001 (talk) 09:23, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
It would help to know which article you are referring to and to what approval you are seeking; I think you mean a New Pages Patroller's approval; that's an entirely volunteer run process.
Please be patient. 331dot (talk) 09:30, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Yes, I am referring to a New Page Patroller's approval. Here is the article: Derrick Lui. Thank you! Greatben001 (talk) 09:38, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I see that you took a picture of him, are you associated with him in some way(in order to get access to him to take his picture)? You've also only edited about him or his work.
Yes, a Patroller will eventually review the draft, but this may not be done quickly. 331dot (talk) 09:55, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
No, I am not associated with him. A colleague with whom I discussed my recent article is familiar with his short films and was the one who sent me a picture, from which I only cropped his image. My knowledge of him and his work is limited to information available from secondary sources. I would appreciate it if anyone with additional information about his life and work could improve the article. Greatben001 (talk) 10:12, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Greatben001 If you personally did not take the picture, nor your colleague(it sounds like), you must immediately without delay request deletion of the image from Commons, unless you can clearly show that the image was released with a license compatible with Wikipedia's(allowing for reuse by anyone for any purpose with attribution). You cropping it makes no difference in this regard. 331dot (talk) 13:30, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Somebody has already marked the image for possible copyright violation, which I believe is not fair. I confirmed with my colleague about the issue, and he explained that he personally took the picture on the red carpet at an event. I was cautious before uploading it because I had a similar experience recently. Greatben001 (talk) 13:54, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Greatben001 We take copyright really seriously on Wikipedia: your colleague must release the photo to Commons under a compatible license. You can't just upload a photograph your colleague took just because you say he said you can. qcne (talk) 14:15, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Please, guide me on how he can do that. Should I ask him to send me a To Whom It May Concern as evidence or what? Greatben001 (talk) 14:21, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Greatben001 The easiest thing would be for him to create an account on Wikimedia Commons himself, then upload the photo. Note that by uploading the photo he is releasing it under a license that permits anyone to reuse and remix the photo for any reason, including for commercial purposes. Please see Commons:First_steps/Contributing qcne (talk) 14:27, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Greatben001 See WP:A picture of you. Gråbergs Gråa Sång (talk) 15:46, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Thanks Greatben001 (talk) 16:16, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Greatben001 Is your colleague associated with the subject? I assume he wasn't at the "red carpet event" at random; he also seemed to have pretty good access to the event. 331dot (talk) 15:58, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
He is not associated with the subject but has good access to the event.
Greatben001 (talk) 16:16, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Indeed, it seems to be beyond what most ordinary people would have. Thank you 331dot (talk) 16:26, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I have reviewed the article in question. @Greatben001:, thank you for your contribution to Wikipedia. QuicoleJR (talk) 22:38, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Thank you! Greatben001 (talk) 11:51, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Updating existing Wikipedia Profile[edit]
Dear Sir,
Is this the online venue to request editorial assistance in updating a profile.
Thank you.
Husky84 Dccovey1 (talk) 17:49, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Dccovey1: Welcome to Wikipedia. If you are Dana Curtis Covey, then I recommend reading Wikipedia:FAQ/Article subjects. You can suggest edits on the article's talk page using an edit request. jlwoodwa (talk) 17:54, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Wikipedia does not contain any profiles; such things are found on social media. What we have are articles about notable topics, constructed from verifiable reliable sources not related to the subject. --Orange Mike | Talk 02:36, 20 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Wiktionary defines profile as: "Noun: A summary or collection of information, especially about a person". It is not unreasonable for a lay person to refer to a Wikipedia biography as such. Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 11:25, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
How do I expand pages correctly.[edit]
I found pages of what I want to edit, they are short and I want to expand them. I don't want to mess up since I'm not experienced at this. I need help, what should I do and what shouldn't I do. I have links for the page I want to expand 169.244.113.129 (talk) 15:22, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
If this is the wrong section, please redirect me to the right place to ask this. 169.244.113.129 (talk) 15:24, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hello, IP user.
There is no particular way you should or shouldn't do this.
But some things that are worth keeping in mind are:
Verifiability. Every single thing in an article should be verifiable from a reliable published source, and in most cases from a source wholly independent of the subject. There is not formally a requirement that everything
be cited, but reviewers of new articles, for example, generally require this; and if you're adding some information and so (necessarily) have a source for it, why wouldn't you help the reader by citing the source? - see WP:REFB for how to do this.
Neutral point of view. An article should be a neutral summary of what the sources say, and very little else. It's not required that all sources be neutral - partisan sources are perfectly acceptable, if they are regarded as reliable - but the article should summarise what they say in a neutral way. In particular, no article should express a judgment - or even use judgmental words (see PEACOCK in Wikipedia's voice, though it is sometimes acceptable to directly quote an independent source expressing a judgment. Never put your own opinions, about anything, into an article.
No original research: only what is in the sources, not anything you know or think apart from the sources; and you should not advance any arguments or conclusions except what is in a source.
Don't worry if you don't get it right, and somebody reverts your edit: this is a normal part of learning, and indeed of editing. See WP:BRD.
I advise you to make small edits rather than great big ones, because if somebody does disagree with one, they can revert just that one, leaving your other work intact. ColinFine (talk) 15:45, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Ok, got it.
Thanks! 169.244.113.129 (talk) 16:00, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I just don't want to get any warnings or/and bans. 169.244.113.129 (talk) 16:01, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
You won't get banned (or blocked) for behaving in good faith, only for repeated or egregious abuse. Likewise, any "warnings" should be expressed as friendly advice, under the same circumstances. Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 16:26, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Might be a scam[edit]
Presumed Wikipedia Page Creation & Editing Opportunity that might be a scam
Hi,
I have received an email (twice) from a certain Steve Thompsan, Wikipedia Moderator, (from a Gmail address with a user id = thompsan.wikipediaeditor). His messages start with
"... My name is Steve Thompsan, and I have been part of the Wikipedia editing community for the past seven years. During this time, I have worked to support the accurate presentation of academic careers, especially those of individuals who have achieved Emeritus status".
The he claims that he can help me create a "carefully maintained Wikipedia entry".
His messages are suspicious; I suppose that it is a scam or a money making venture, maybe from a previous employee. Can you please confirm if he is really an employee of yours and if I can trust answering back to his messages?
Thank you very much for your help,
Jose 87.235.62.220 (talk) 17:10, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
IP Yes, this is a WP:SCAM and you should report it as described at the linked page. We don't have moderators but Administrators. Mike Turnbull (talk) 17:20, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
addition to historical information re Napoleon II[edit]
I am computer stupid.
I am heavily into history. I have read a book which presents information regarding the death of Nap II, which I believe to be accurate.
The book is
Assassination at St Helena Revisited, Ben Weider and Sten Forshufvud, Pub. by John Wiley & Sons
ISBN 0-471-12677-2
Chapter 49 pp 430-439
The authors and
first book were cited under your work on Napoleon I in a somewhat speculative manner.
The book is very strongly presented with descriptions and data to propose murder by poison for Nap I, and the repetition of symptoms of Nap II is equally strong for the same conclusion.
I wonder if someone would refer this information to an appropriate individual for a more appropriate summation of one or both individuals.
Wikipedia is frequently the first source for information on historical subjects, if not the only source.
From a forensic point of view this book presents an overwhelming preponderance of evidence of blatatant murder.
I believe in truth in the presentation of history.
jude smith 1946judekendo (talk) 19:29, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hello, @1946judekendo. The best way to find somebody interested in this subject is to post either on the talk page of an article about it (eg Talk:Napoleon II), or a related WikiProject, such as WT:WikiProject France.
Even if you post there, there's no guarantee that an editor will respond, but it's more likely than here. Wikipedia is entirely edited by volunteer editors like you and me, who work on what they choose: nobody assigns work to anybody.
One possibility is that you make the change yourself, or suggest it. It sounds as if you have a fairly clear idea what you would like the article(s) to say: if you post that on the relevant talk page, with a citation to where the information comes to (preferably with page numbers), then it's more likely that somebody will pick up your suggestion and add it to the article - or discuss it with you if they don't think it's exactly appropriate, so you can reach consensus as to what should be added. ColinFine (talk) 21:48, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Note that this book and theory regarding Napoleon I is also discussed in the article Sten Forshufvud, and its extension to Napoleon II has already been raised in Talk:Napoleon II#Cause of death. {The poster formerly known as 87.81.230.195} 90.193.153.108 (talk) 01:19, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
American late-night talk show monologues[edit]
American late-night talk show monologues are de-facto news digests
All of Strike Force Five seem to be targets.
One could make a chronological list of news stories, on a daily basis, that they all ridiculed.
Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Kimmel, Seth Meyers, and Jimmy Fallon
John Oliver is one topic weekly
Seth Meyers is next
Would a chronological list of news stories, on a daily basis, that Strike Force Five ridiculed be a Wikipedia:Encyclopedic
article?
(Reliability of Wikipedia)
Piñanana (talk) 01:45, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Though I've heard of the hosts, I hadn't heard of Strike Force Five till I read your question and, immediately afterwards, the article Strike Force Five. When you say "All of Strike Force Five seem to be targets", do you mean "Each of the episodes of Strike Force Five seem to have had targets"? If so, how many targets per episode? If no more than three, then the table in the current article could be augmented to show this. If five or more, then it couldn't -- but it might be called "indiscriminate information". The article shows that there were 12 episodes, no two of which appeared on consecutive days; why "on a daily basis" (above)? (And what do you mean by saying that Meyers "is next"?) NB when I say that the table could be augmented, I don't mean that this would necessarily be a good thing; rather, it would be something you could reasonably ask about in Talk:Strike Force Five. -- Hoary (talk) 07:54, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Their statement appears to be a reference to Colbert's cancellation and Kimmel's suspension, meaning they likely meant a list of stories ridiculed on the five comedians' shows. @Piñanana: As for your original question, I doubt that a list like that could be an encyclopedic article, per our policy on indiscriminate information, but it isn't impossible. If you want to try making one, feel free to start a draft. While drafting it, please keep in mind our verifiability policy and our guideline on the notability of lists. Hope this helps.

Social media[edit]
is it wrong for wikipedia usernames to ask for social media accounts on talk pages
User talk:45dogs#Do you have a social media account
check this for more info 49.237.23.152 (talk) 08:37, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
You seem to be asking if what you did is okay- it's not unusual for editors to ask other editors about means to communicate off wiki. An editor is under no obligation to answer such inquiries, but I know of no policy categorically prohibiting them. 331dot (talk) 08:47, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
so its allowed but discoraged
49.237.23.152 (talk) 08:37, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I don't know that it's discouraged, in the sense that there is any policy discouraging it. My experience is that most Wikipedia editors prefer communication with other editors to take place openly, on Wikipedia talk and discussion pages, unless there is a compelling reason for private communication. ColinFine (talk) 09:34, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Further, I, and I think other editors, tend to be suspicious of discussion of Wikipedia issues on media outside Wikipedia. Obviously anybody has a right to do so, but it often seems to be either inappropriate canvassing, or discussion by and for people who don't understand what Wikipedia is and how it works; or both. ColinFine (talk) 09:42, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
A lot will depend on context. If you're getting along with an editor, collaborating on articles, no-one is likely to object. If you're asking repeatedly, or as a form of harassment or hounding, or in an attempt at outing, it could lead to a block.

Mayank Bawa[edit]
article tagged as "Tag: use of deprecated (unreliable) source", but there are none
Dear Admin,
the article Mayank Bawa has been tagged as "Tag: use of deprecated (unreliable) source", but I cant tell which unreliable source it is referring to. Can you please help.
Thanks Gokodogo (talk) 00:01, 20 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Gokodogo:, we are mostly not admins here. The tag is automatic and has a link labelled "deprecated (unreliable) source". If you click on it you should be able to look for the sources you used. I found Crunchbase listed as deprecated and Linkedin and PR Newswire as generally unreliable, with explanations why. I would suggest looking for better sources. TSventon (talk) 01:10, 20 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Gokodogo:, the script at User:Headbomb/unreliable will colour-code sources on a scale from green (great) through shades of yellow and red to black (eek) Jimfbleak - talk to me? 10:55, 20 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Translated citations[edit]
About newspaper quotes. Does the title of the article have to remain in the original language?
Draft:Yukiko Nakahori is tlanslated me with Deepl tlanslate.
So I got lost when I translated a newspaper quote.
Please tell me if the quoted title must remain in the original language. H2-T2 (talk) 07:53, 20 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The {{Cite news}} template has a |trans-title= parameter that might be what you are looking for (if you intend to use the original title and a translation). -- Cl3phact0 (talk) 08:14, 20 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
That template also has the parameter |trans-quote= if you need to show exactly what the newspaper said and translate it. There is some advice at MOS:QUOTE. Mike Turnbull (talk) 11:07, 20 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Creating New Page[edit]
I'm working on a wiki page about the Pokémon Gallade. How do I get it published and change the title of its name? The Neofighter (talk) 12:44, 20 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The Neofighter I've moved your draft to Draft:Gallade (Pokémon). Creating a new article is one of the hardest things you can work on in Wikipedia, so I wouldn't recommend beginning your career with such a challenging task, but you can look at the instructions at the Your First Article page if you really want to write an article about Gallade. In particular, you'll have to prove that it is notable enough to warrant a separate Wikipedia article. Sungodtemple (talk • contribs) 14:35, 20 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@The Neofighter: Gallade once had an article at [1] but it was redirected. Gallade (Pokémon) is now a redirect to List of generation IV Pokémon#Gallade. See Wikipedia:WikiProject Pokémon#History. PrimeHunter (talk) 20:43, 20 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Yeah, but I want to create a whole page about it. Like how Gardevoir has a whole page about it already. The Neofighter (talk) 22:22, 20 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hello, @The Neofighter.
My earnest advice to new editors is to not even think about
trying to create an article until you have spent several weeks - at least - learning about how Wikipedia works by making improvements to existing articles. Once you have understood core policies such as verifiability, neutral point of view, reliable, independent sources, and notability, and experienced how we handle disagreements with other editors (the Bold, Revert, Discuss cycle), then you might be ready to read your first article carefully, and try creating a draft. If you don't follow this advice but try to create an article without this preparation, you are likely to have a frustrating and disappointing experience with Wikipedia.
If you insist on giving yourself that frustrating experience, then follow Sungodtemple's advice and before you do anything else understand notability and find the necessary sources which all meet all the criteria in WP:42. ColinFine (talk) 20:12, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Weird partial-upload problem with SVG file[edit]
Hello! I'm trying to upload this image as a new version of File:Lotus Cars logo.svg, but when I try to upload the new version, it changes the size of the image, but not the actual image data?? It's able to read the new image's size as being 16x16, but rather than upload the image, it in effect resizes the current one to be 16x16 without actually changing to the new image, which is what I want. I have never seen this happen before, and have no clue how it's even technically possible for Wikipedia's file upload system to behave like this. Any ideas on what's going on here? UniProbe62 (talk) 01:18, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@UniProbe62: I'm not sure what you think is wrong. I don't see a problem. Clicking the date or image of your first upload at File:Lotus Cars logo.svg#filehistory leads to a 64×64 image at
https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/archive/2/2f/20250921010144%21Lotus_Cars_logo.svg. It's an SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) image so it stores information about how to generate an image which can be scaled to a larger size without losing quality. The file history displays a scaling to the same size for all versions. The current version of a Wikipedia file called "Lotus Cars logo.svg" will always be at https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/2f/Lotus_Cars_logo.svg. "2/2f/" is computed from the file name and is not something related to the version of the image. PrimeHunter (talk) 02:14, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Okay this is really bizarre. When I first tried to upload it, I opened the newly-replaced current version, and it was a 64x64 version of the autotraced image, which didn't make sense as what I had uploaded was a 64x64 version of the official image. Fast-forward to today, and clicking on that same exact file in the version history results in the thing I uploaded, the 64x64 official one! Meaning, a single revision somehow itself changed? Which is something that should be completely and utterly impossible from a technical level. UniProbe62 (talk) 23:21, 24 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
It did it again! This time I just reverted to the version I had uploaded (which should in theory mean that the "current" version is identical to 17:57, September 20, 2025, which displays the correct official one), and yet now, https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/2f/Lotus_Cars_logo.svg (the current version) displays as THE OLD AUTOTRACED ONE! Either something is going horribly wrong on my end, or there's something wonky with how this file is stored. I have no idea. UniProbe62 (talk) 23:27, 24 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Okay nevermind then??? Now, somehow, they do match. I can only assume that whatever process updates the file is being reeeaalllly slow for some reason. Right now, for me at least, Lotus Cars#/media/File:Lotus Cars logo.svg still displays as the old autotraced one (even after purging the article), even though now the current version is the official one. Are Wikipedia's images just like this? It takes a weirdly long time for everything to update when a new version is uploaded? UniProbe62 (talk) 23:34, 24 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Using short citations[edit]
Hello, recently I tried to convert Chu Kheng Lim v Minister to use the WP:SHORTCITE citation method as I've heard it's better for repeated citations where specific pinpoints are different for different claims. I'd just like an experienced editor to check over the article and make sure I've done it correctly as it doesn't seem to look the same as other articles I've seen using this method. Any tips or help with using this method would be much appreciated :) SnowyRiver28 (talk) 03:08, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
(1) What source does "Chu Kheng Lim" refer to? It could mean either of the first two references in the reference section.
(2) What are things like "[40]" in the references? They're not page numbers. Clarityfiend (talk) 07:16, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The Chu Kheng Lim refers to the actual high court judgement document, and the numbers are paragraph numbers from the judgement document. This is done closely to how Australian legal citations are usually written, which probably isn’t aligned with Wikipedia’s syntax for citations. SnowyRiver28 (talk) 07:42, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@SnowyRiver28, you say that "it doesn't seem to look the same" as other articles with short citations. Those articles most likely use {{sfn}} or {{harvnb}} which is why they have a similar appearance. According to WP:CITEVAR, the citations are fine as long as they are consistent within an article. There are some Featured Articles that use plain text short citations (like "The Raven") which you could use as an example if the templates seem too complicated. The only specific feedback I would give for the article you recently updated would be to use the short citations to get more specific inline citations. For example, one source is over 60 pages long but the short citations don't include page numbers or other in-source locations, Rjjiii (talk) 02:32, 22 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

I looked at your page on the population of Israel and you are publishing, as the very first source, population figures that eliminate Palestinians in the West Bank. They don't exist, according to Wikipedia.
Then google replicates the demograpic figures presented in other searches.
This, during a time of genocide by the US and Israel of the Palestinians.
You are helping erase them and facilitating the public acceptance of their elimination.
It's unconscionable.
Shame on you.

It's not exactly accurate to say that "they don't exist, according to Wikipedia".
Although Demographics of Israel does not include Palestinians living in the West Bank in its population numbers, Demographics of Palestine does count them. The West Bank is legally considered a militarily occupied territory, although Israel considers it "disputed" rather than "occupied".
To count Palestinians living in the West Bank as part of the population of Israel would be to say that the West Bank is part of Israel, rather than Palestinian territory under military occupation or even disputed territory.

#property - how does it work?[edit]
While copyediting an article Norwegian School of Economics I came across something I've never seen before, the #property template. This template, for example "{{#property:P571}}" apparently gets data from somewhere and replaces it in the article. In this example in the article, the template gets replaced by a year.
I'd like to understand how this works. Would you please direct me to a description of #property.
I've tried searching for it on Wikipedia, which only gives me a series of articles about "property. A similar search on Google does mostly the same, plus some scripting language sites that aren't very helpful.

@Kareng777 Prior to being redirected, the article did not cite any sources for the "Early life and education" and "Early career" sections, so it's not clear where the information in those sections came from.
Also, looking through the references, you cite Wikipedia as a source at least twice, which is not an allowable source, and a lot of the other sources are not independant.
The article text is still available using the history tab.

Honorifics[edit]
Édouard Muller (businessman) is a bit of a mess of an article, with barely referenced original research dating back to 2013 taking up a majority of the page, though I think it can be salvaged with more citations and copyediting. One issue I noticed that I haven't really seen on most pages is the overuse of honorifics like "Mr. Example" and "Mrs. Blank" instead of a full name. But due to the lack of easily verifiable citations all I could do was remove the majority of these (see page history) and not provide any given name. Is there anything in the manual of style about what to do when a first name is not given? I'm not yet prepared to spend days learning about the early history of Nestle to get these names and source the article properly. This is also an invitation for any experts on the subject to look over the page since I haven't done much. Thanks! MynameisnotDwight (talk) 02:09, 23 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
All I know is we shouldn't use honorifics.
As for names, some of them aren't important and can be removed completely. For example, there's this passage:
At that time, Nestlé had several head offices including one in London with L. Auget as president, one in Paris with Liotard and another in Cham with Page, and one in Vevey, Switzerland with Roussy, whose family held a large block of Nestlé stock. Dapples reorganized Nestlé and those four aforementioned managers were forced to quit. Dapples looked for someone who had overall knowledge and sales experience to run the business with him. Muller was selected and was sent all over Europe to report on the actual situation facing various branches of the Nestlé group.
I'd rewrite it as:
At that time, Nestlé had several head offices including London, Paris, Cham, and Vevey, Switzerland. After a reorganization forced managers in four of those locations to quit, Muller was sent all over Europe to report on the actual situation facing various branches of the Nestlé group.
There seemed to be a lot of stuff there with meaningless names that nobody cares about, which can be removed. ~Anachronist (talk) 03:58, 23 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Admins are not staff, they are volunteers like most everyone else here. 331dot (talk) 07:44, 24 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Allen Carr Israel[edit]
Would Allen Carr Israel (allencarr.co.il) qualify for a Wikipedia article?
Hello,
I am seeking guidance from the community here about whether a website I manage—Allen Carr Israel (https://www.allencarr.co.il/) —would qualify for a standalone Wikipedia article. I want to ensure we comply with Wikipedia’s notability guidelines and avoid any issues of promotional content.
Here are key details about the site:
Purpose: The site offers quit-smoking workshops, online courses, and resources aimed at helping people stop smoking using the Allen Carr method.
Reach & Impact: It serves clients in Israel and internationally, with testimonials of people who have quit successfully following its programs.
Independent sources: We currently have a few media mentions, local news coverage, and blog reviews. (If needed, I can provide citations.)
Content & Structure: The site includes detailed explanation of the method, a blog section, resources, and contact / workshop listings.
I would like your advice on:
Whether this satisfies Wikipedia’s notability criteria (third-party independent reliable sources)
What kind of sources and citations would strengthen the case
How to draft a neutral, verifiable article without promotional language
If creating a draft in my user space first is recommended
Thank you in advance for any pointers or links to existing guidance on this topic. Shay268 (talk) 10:12, 24 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hello, @Shay268.
First, if you manage that website and you intend to do anything related to the website in Wikipedia, you must declare your status as a paid editor (see that link for where and how). This is part of the terms of service.
Secondly, whether or not an article about the site is possible depends on whether or not it meets Wikipedia's criteria for notability - which is not about what it is, does, or says, or what people associated with it are, do, or say, or its importance, fame, popularity etc, but almost entirely about whether it has been written about, in depth, by people wholly unconnected with it, in reliable publications. "Mentions" will not cut it, nor will almost all blogs, nor will testimonials.
If you can find at least three published sources about it that meet all of the crteria in WP:42, then an article may be possible.
Having said all that, My earnest advice to new editors is to not even think about
trying to create an article until you have spent several weeks - at least - learning about how Wikipedia works by making improvements to existing articles. Once you have understood core policies such as verifiability, neutral point of view, reliable, independent sources, and notability, and experienced how we handle disagreements with other editors (the Bold, Revert, Discuss cycle), then you might be ready to read your first article carefully, and try creating a draft. If you don't follow this advice but try to create an article without this preparation, you are likely to have a frustrating and disappointing experience with Wikipedia.

Per-country editing stats[edit]
From an IP address it should be possible to determine the country of origin, unless a VPN is in use. Do we have statistics for users by country or edits by country? ―Mandruss ☎ IMO. 13:25, 24 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
While I'm unsure if a specific count exists somewhere, such data could not include registered users without either them directly revealing this country (i.e. through a "This user is a proud resident of X" userbox) or having their non-public IP information used for... what to me, appears to be a neat but superficial statistic. Here on Wikipedia, I and numerous others take the security of our non-public information, including geolocation as vague as "country", awful seriously.

Disabling a shortcut[edit]
Is it possible to disable the ctrl+v shortcut that uploads an image from clipboard to Commons? In all the cases I've tried to use it, the popup is incapable of uploading images with the licenses I usually upload images from, and thus is just looking to me like a long-winded "go to Commons directly to upload" popup.

Hey @Departure–. I think this question would be answered well at the Commons help desk. PhoenixCaelestis (Talk · Contributions) 00:26, 25 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
