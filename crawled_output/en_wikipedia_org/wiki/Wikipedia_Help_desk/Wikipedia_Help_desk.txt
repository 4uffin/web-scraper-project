Mayank Bawa[edit]
article tagged as "Tag: use of deprecated (unreliable) source", but there are none
Dear Admin,
the article Mayank Bawa has been tagged as "Tag: use of deprecated (unreliable) source", but I cant tell which unreliable source it is referring to. Can you please help.
Thanks Gokodogo (talk) 00:01, 20 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Gokodogo:, we are mostly not admins here. The tag is automatic and has a link labelled "deprecated (unreliable) source". If you click on it you should be able to look for the sources you used. I found Crunchbase listed as deprecated and Linkedin and PR Newswire as generally unreliable, with explanations why. I would suggest looking for better sources. TSventon (talk) 01:10, 20 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Gokodogo:, the script at User:Headbomb/unreliable will colour-code sources on a scale from green (great) through shades of yellow and red to black (eek) Jimfbleak - talk to me? 10:55, 20 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Translated citations[edit]
About newspaper quotes. Does the title of the article have to remain in the original language?
Draft:Yukiko Nakahori is tlanslated me with Deepl tlanslate.
So I got lost when I translated a newspaper quote.
Please tell me if the quoted title must remain in the original language. H2-T2 (talk) 07:53, 20 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The {{Cite news}} template has a |trans-title= parameter that might be what you are looking for (if you intend to use the original title and a translation). -- Cl3phact0 (talk) 08:14, 20 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
That template also has the parameter |trans-quote= if you need to show exactly what the newspaper said and translate it. There is some advice at MOS:QUOTE. Mike Turnbull (talk) 11:07, 20 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

@Gerhardr1: If you refer to pages you have stored in a Wikipedia app then they cannot be seen with a browser.

Baseball Croatia[edit]
About Croatia joined the Confederation of European Baseball in 1992 during the war for independence. Croatian first national team ever played on Europe tournament in Germany. There are was Pioneers of baseball like Sasso, Grgur Marušić, Robert Lorenz, Danijel Frketić, Andrej Radovanič etc. They deserve to be mentioned. EditZg (talk) 20:04, 20 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hello, @EditZg. If there are changes you want to suggest to an article, the best place to do that is on the talk page of that article. Remember that unless there are reliable published sources where the information can be verified, then it will not be added. ColinFine (talk) 22:15, 20 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Reference parameters[edit]
I need help modifying some parameters about some references in a translated article. ==
I need help parameterizing these references in this article: Companion parrot This page was originally written in English and needed to be translated into Spanish. Please, if anyone who knows anything would like to contribute, I'd be happy to hear from you. 2800:484:9661:7D00:7163:A0DC:95B6:A744 (talk) 00:56, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hello, IP user. I suggest asking at es:Wikipedia:Café, where people are more likely to understand the templates available on es Wikipedia. It may not be simply a matter of translating parameter names (though it might be). ColinFine (talk) 20:16, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Weird partial-upload problem with SVG file[edit]
Hello! I'm trying to upload this image as a new version of File:Lotus Cars logo.svg, but when I try to upload the new version, it changes the size of the image, but not the actual image data?? It's able to read the new image's size as being 16x16, but rather than upload the image, it in effect resizes the current one to be 16x16 without actually changing to the new image, which is what I want. I have never seen this happen before, and have no clue how it's even technically possible for Wikipedia's file upload system to behave like this. Any ideas on what's going on here? UniProbe62 (talk) 01:18, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@UniProbe62: I'm not sure what you think is wrong. I don't see a problem. Clicking the date or image of your first upload at File:Lotus Cars logo.svg#filehistory leads to a 64×64 image at
https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/archive/2/2f/20250921010144%21Lotus_Cars_logo.svg. It's an SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) image so it stores information about how to generate an image which can be scaled to a larger size without losing quality. The file history displays a scaling to the same size for all versions. The current version of a Wikipedia file called "Lotus Cars logo.svg" will always be at https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/2f/Lotus_Cars_logo.svg. "2/2f/" is computed from the file name and is not something related to the version of the image. PrimeHunter (talk) 02:14, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Okay this is really bizarre. When I first tried to upload it, I opened the newly-replaced current version, and it was a 64x64 version of the autotraced image, which didn't make sense as what I had uploaded was a 64x64 version of the official image. Fast-forward to today, and clicking on that same exact file in the version history results in the thing I uploaded, the 64x64 official one! Meaning, a single revision somehow itself changed? Which is something that should be completely and utterly impossible from a technical level. UniProbe62 (talk) 23:21, 24 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
It did it again! This time I just reverted to the version I had uploaded (which should in theory mean that the "current" version is identical to 17:57, September 20, 2025, which displays the correct official one), and yet now, https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/2f/Lotus_Cars_logo.svg (the current version) displays as THE OLD AUTOTRACED ONE! Either something is going horribly wrong on my end, or there's something wonky with how this file is stored. I have no idea. UniProbe62 (talk) 23:27, 24 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Okay nevermind then??? Now, somehow, they do match. I can only assume that whatever process updates the file is being reeeaalllly slow for some reason. Right now, for me at least, Lotus Cars#/media/File:Lotus Cars logo.svg still displays as the old autotraced one (even after purging the article), even though now the current version is the official one. Are Wikipedia's images just like this? It takes a weirdly long time for everything to update when a new version is uploaded? UniProbe62 (talk) 23:34, 24 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Using short citations[edit]
Hello, recently I tried to convert Chu Kheng Lim v Minister to use the WP:SHORTCITE citation method as I've heard it's better for repeated citations where specific pinpoints are different for different claims. I'd just like an experienced editor to check over the article and make sure I've done it correctly as it doesn't seem to look the same as other articles I've seen using this method. Any tips or help with using this method would be much appreciated :) SnowyRiver28 (talk) 03:08, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
(1) What source does "Chu Kheng Lim" refer to? It could mean either of the first two references in the reference section.
(2) What are things like "[40]" in the references? They're not page numbers. Clarityfiend (talk) 07:16, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The Chu Kheng Lim refers to the actual high court judgement document, and the numbers are paragraph numbers from the judgement document. This is done closely to how Australian legal citations are usually written, which probably isn’t aligned with Wikipedia’s syntax for citations. SnowyRiver28 (talk) 07:42, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@SnowyRiver28, you say that "it doesn't seem to look the same" as other articles with short citations. Those articles most likely use {{sfn}} or {{harvnb}} which is why they have a similar appearance. According to WP:CITEVAR, the citations are fine as long as they are consistent within an article. There are some Featured Articles that use plain text short citations (like "The Raven") which you could use as an example if the templates seem too complicated. The only specific feedback I would give for the article you recently updated would be to use the short citations to get more specific inline citations. For example, one source is over 60 pages long but the short citations don't include page numbers or other in-source locations, Rjjiii (talk) 02:32, 22 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
How to fix suggested languages[edit]
Hello, I’m wondering if it is possible to fix suggested languages in the language sidebar. I speak English, Tok Pisin and Ukrainian but I accidentally clicked Basque, Ladin, Malagasy and Japanese once and I don’t know how to remove from suggested languages. DanaroEnEuskara (talk) 12:15, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@DanaroEnEuskara: this has been asked before. The best answer I can find is from ColinFine - This is controlled by mw:Universal Language Selector/Compact Language Links, and that seems to have some instructions for managing suggested languages. I haven't tried it myself. I would be interested to know if it works. TSventon (talk) 13:23, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

As I a new I wanted to understand in Putnam county in past times[edit]
Let me introduce myself, I am Michael Sigler-Packwood, I am eighty-two years old retired Construction Manager, I now write novels. I use Wikipedia when I do my research. I now have apologise for not asking this question first, which is, am I allowed in the first instance to write about myself to tell all those that read this I am a newcomer. with the aim of finding someone who might live in Putnam County Indiana in the USA, I am English by the way. My reasons are: In 2018 I discovered my bloodline family are the Sigler Family, My grandfather was a George Sigler born on the family horse breeding farm, a carpenter constructing timber covered Bridges like those in Madison County, in an effort to put together of life in that county between 1829 to 1929 when the business collapsed. I am sorry it is such along question. Michael Sigler-Packwood (talk) 06:54, 22 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Can anyone tell me what additional info should i put in this Yevheniia redirect? Its a derivative of Cyrillic first name Evgenia. zoglophie•talk• 10:05, 22 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Zoglophie:, redirects don't have extra information, but they can have special redirect categories and sometimes ordinary categories. For example the wikicode for Erzsebet is:
#REDIRECT [[Elizabeth (given name)#Name variants]]
{{Redirect category shell|
{{R to list entry}}
{{R to section}}
}}
[[Category:Hungarian feminine given names]]

Transclude list into subbullet hlist[edit]
I am trying to transclude the list section Mulberry paper#List of mulberry papers into a subbullet hlist on List of types of paper#Papers by cellulose source, under the Bark bulletpoint, using {.{#section-h:PAGENAME|SECTIONNAME}}.
I am running into an issue where the transcluded Mulberry papers list does format into an hlist, but only outside of the Papers by cellulose source list. If I put it on the same line, it goes back to a regular list. I have tried nowrap to no avail. chickenpox4dinner (talk) 20:06, 22 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Help with wiki formatting[edit]
Bournemouth,_Christchurch_and_Poole_Council so for my first proper edit I wanted to fix the broken formatting in the main infobox and I can't figure it out - I think the nowiki is the issue but I can't seem to get it right.
Also process help - should I have tagged someone on the talk page for the article or added it to a list somewhere?
LGBTbrickworks (talk) 22:05, 22 September 2025 (UTC) Rose (she/her)[reply]
Hello, LGBTBrickworks. I believe I've fixed it. It is extremely rare to want a <nowiki> anywhere in an article - I removed them. You were also missing the closing ]] of the wikilink to BCP Independent group, which broke the syntax when I removed the nowiki's. But since there is no such article, I have delinked that name.
I also replaced the URL in your question above with a Wikilink, so when I open it in my browser, it doesn't format the article as though it was on my mobile. --ColinFine (talk) 23:06, 22 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Thanks so much - I'm quickly learning a lot about what goes on around here and I like it! I'm not very good at writing stuff so I've gotta find my niche thing - perhaps it's finding nowikis across the main namespace!

Page deleted?[edit]
Hello. I created a Wikipedia page for Edward M. Goldfarb, who is the international composer for Pokémon the Series, the Pokémon movies and a longtime collaborator of Francis Ford Coppola's. I posted it at least as recently as January 2025. Now it's gone and I can't find any reason why this happened. I'm trying to find out if it was taken down on purpose, and if so, why. Please advise. Much appreciated. Kareng777 (talk) 00:06, 23 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Kareng777, Onel5969 turned it into a redirect on the grounds that there's "not enough in-depth coverage from independent, reliable sources to show they pass WP:GNG". -- Hoary (talk) 00:11, 23 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Kareng777 Prior to being redirected, the article did not cite any sources for the "Early life and education" and "Early career" sections, so it's not clear where the information in those sections came from.
Also, looking through the references, you cite Wikipedia as a source at least twice, which is not an allowable source, and a lot of the other sources are not independant.
The article text is still available using the history tab.
If you are able to fix those sourcing issues, feel free to restore the article with appropriate edits to fix it.
If you need help accessing the history, let us know. ~ ONUnicorn(Talk|Contribs)problem solving 15:14, 23 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Honorifics[edit]
Édouard Muller (businessman) is a bit of a mess of an article, with barely referenced original research dating back to 2013 taking up a majority of the page, though I think it can be salvaged with more citations and copyediting. One issue I noticed that I haven't really seen on most pages is the overuse of honorifics like "Mr. Example" and "Mrs. Blank" instead of a full name. But due to the lack of easily verifiable citations all I could do was remove the majority of these (see page history) and not provide any given name. Is there anything in the manual of style about what to do when a first name is not given? I'm not yet prepared to spend days learning about the early history of Nestle to get these names and source the article properly. This is also an invitation for any experts on the subject to look over the page since I haven't done much. Thanks! MynameisnotDwight (talk) 02:09, 23 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
All I know is we shouldn't use honorifics.
As for names, some of them aren't important and can be removed completely. For example, there's this passage:
At that time, Nestlé had several head offices including one in London with L. Auget as president, one in Paris with Liotard and another in Cham with Page, and one in Vevey, Switzerland with Roussy, whose family held a large block of Nestlé stock. Dapples reorganized Nestlé and those four aforementioned managers were forced to quit. Dapples looked for someone who had overall knowledge and sales experience to run the business with him. Muller was selected and was sent all over Europe to report on the actual situation facing various branches of the Nestlé group.
I'd rewrite it as:
At that time, Nestlé had several head offices including London, Paris, Cham, and Vevey, Switzerland. After a reorganization forced managers in four of those locations to quit, Muller was sent all over Europe to report on the actual situation facing various branches of the Nestlé group.
There seemed to be a lot of stuff there with meaningless names that nobody cares about, which can be removed. ~Anachronist (talk) 03:58, 23 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Note that, from its article, that's Cham, Switzerland, not Cham, Germany. {The poster formerly known as 87.81.230.195} 90.193.153.108 (talk) 16:15, 23 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

That's an issue to discuss on the user talk page, Talk:Ella May Wiggins; what matters is what the most commonly used name is for her in reliable sources, not necessarily her legal name. See WP:COMMONNAME. 331dot (talk) 09:54, 23 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Note that the article's Death section already states (though without citation) "Her maiden name is misspelled on the marker at her gravesite." {The poster formerly known as 87.81.230.195} 90.193.153.108 (talk) 16:08, 23 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

wikitable discussions. rowspan restore.[edit]
Currently in Wikipedia, if a sortable table is make with an entry that has rowspan, it is "broken" into identical cells. However, when *all* column sorts are sorted back to null state (first click is forward, second is backwards, third is back to original order), the rowspanned cells are still broken. Where is the proper place to discuss this behavior and the code can be made so that when all sorts are undone the original state of the table is restored?Naraht (talk) 17:40, 23 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

@FischerTony:, Northeast Ohio Medical University - The Bitonte College of Dentistry appaers to be opening this year, are you sure it is WP:NOTABLE, i.e. are there enough sources for a Wikipedia article? TSventon (talk) 18:32, 23 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
It has already opened, it has an active website and other official accreditations and websites which refer to the accreditations.
i don’t know how to link it to the main NEOMED page, or fix the two errors WK says are on the page. 2600:2B00:72AC:C000:A16D:2F17:C9A7:5176 (talk) 20:44, 23 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The article now redirects to Northeast Ohio Medical University. Articles about organisations need to satisfy the criteria in WP:NORG and I doubt that the new dental school qualifies.. You could look at Help:Referencing for beginners for information about coding references. The reference looked like an incomplete {{cite web}}, I am not sure what the problem was with the coordinates. TSventon (talk) 20:58, 23 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Article has been redirected as not independently notable. Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 18:55, 23 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Allen Carr Israel[edit]
Would Allen Carr Israel (allencarr.co.il) qualify for a Wikipedia article?
Hello,
I am seeking guidance from the community here about whether a website I manage—Allen Carr Israel (https://www.allencarr.co.il/) —would qualify for a standalone Wikipedia article. I want to ensure we comply with Wikipedia’s notability guidelines and avoid any issues of promotional content.
Here are key details about the site:
Purpose: The site offers quit-smoking workshops, online courses, and resources aimed at helping people stop smoking using the Allen Carr method.
Reach & Impact: It serves clients in Israel and internationally, with testimonials of people who have quit successfully following its programs.
Independent sources: We currently have a few media mentions, local news coverage, and blog reviews. (If needed, I can provide citations.)
Content & Structure: The site includes detailed explanation of the method, a blog section, resources, and contact / workshop listings.
I would like your advice on:
Whether this satisfies Wikipedia’s notability criteria (third-party independent reliable sources)
What kind of sources and citations would strengthen the case
How to draft a neutral, verifiable article without promotional language
If creating a draft in my user space first is recommended
Thank you in advance for any pointers or links to existing guidance on this topic. Shay268 (talk) 10:12, 24 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hello, @Shay268.
First, if you manage that website and you intend to do anything related to the website in Wikipedia, you must declare your status as a paid editor (see that link for where and how). This is part of the terms of service.
Secondly, whether or not an article about the site is possible depends on whether or not it meets Wikipedia's criteria for notability - which is not about what it is, does, or says, or what people associated with it are, do, or say, or its importance, fame, popularity etc, but almost entirely about whether it has been written about, in depth, by people wholly unconnected with it, in reliable publications. "Mentions" will not cut it, nor will almost all blogs, nor will testimonials.
If you can find at least three published sources about it that meet all of the crteria in WP:42, then an article may be possible.
Having said all that, My earnest advice to new editors is to not even think about
trying to create an article until you have spent several weeks - at least - learning about how Wikipedia works by making improvements to existing articles. Once you have understood core policies such as verifiability, neutral point of view, reliable, independent sources, and notability, and experienced how we handle disagreements with other editors (the Bold, Revert, Discuss cycle), then you might be ready to read your first article carefully, and try creating a draft. If you don't follow this advice but try to create an article without this preparation, you are likely to have a frustrating and disappointing experience with Wikipedia.

Centering?[edit]

Disabling a shortcut[edit]
Is it possible to disable the ctrl+v shortcut that uploads an image from clipboard to Commons? In all the cases I've tried to use it, the popup is incapable of uploading images with the licenses I usually upload images from, and thus is just looking to me like a long-winded "go to Commons directly to upload" popup.

If you mean on Main Page then Claudia Cardinale was listed at "Recent deaths" 24 September.[1] She was unlisted 15 hours later when six new names had been added to the list.[2] Wikipedia:Main Page history/2025 September 24 is a snapshot showing her on the list.

Lost account; created new[edit]
Hi. I hope that this is the correct place to state this, but a previous account of mine “Wikihelper59” has (I do not know when) lost its password. I created this account here, after looking over WP:SOCK as it stated that one could create a new account if the old was lost. The reason I cannot regain the password is due to the fact that I did not sign up an email. Was this the right thing to do? Glasswatercup59 (talk) 01:54, 25 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Yes, it was, @Glasswatercup59. You have also (as recommended) given your old account name on the current user page: I suggest you also edit User:Wikihelper59 to explain what has happened. ColinFine (talk) 10:00, 25 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Time Outed All The Time[edit]
I am a university proffesor in Mexico at the state of SAN LUIS POTOSI the city of the same name as the state, my university is TECNOLOGICO NACIONAL DE MEXICO AND THE CAMPUS IS TECNOLOGICO DE SAN LUIS POTOSI The question is that we can get acces to "Wikipedia", we used to have acces but now just simply appears a timed out response, we have checked all on our network and our conclusion is that maybe our request is considered as a cyberattack because of the number of requests. we have acces to any other webpage but not "wikipedia"
I will appreciate your help in order to know how to solve the problem your guidanec and addressing wil be really valuable poncho (talk) 06:44, 25 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Please don't SHOUT. It makes your message harder to read. Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 09:07, 25 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Ponchobonjo You clearly have access via this account, since you have posted your question. It may be that the IP range your University uses has been blocked because, for example, some users have spammed Wikipedia. It is very unlikely that the quantity of traffic is the problem since Wikipedia is in the top 10 of sites globally and can cope with a huge number of simultaneous requests. As suggested, WP:VPT would put you in touch with experts (still volunteers) who may need more information. For example, is it only the English-language version of Wikipedia where you have problems, or is it on many languages? Mike Turnbull (talk) 11:52, 25 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Links with content likely to change[edit]
Hello, just wondering if there's anything I should do for a citation to a website that is likely to change? The claim in the article is supported by the website's content, but it's hosted on a /updates page which leads me to think it's not a permanent fixture and may change with further updates.
I noticed the IABot sometimes archives websites which would be perfect for this scenario, but how do I make it trigger on that specific link? Or does it archive every link on the page it runs on? Thanks! SnowyRiver28 (talk) 09:43, 25 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
You can manually add a page to the IA, and/or other archive sites. There are various browser add-ons that will do this for you, with one click. I use this one, for example. Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); Talk to Andy; Andy's edits 13:42, 25 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Thank you very much! So I use an addon to make the Internet Archive archive the page, then run the bot which will automatically add the archived link? SnowyRiver28 (talk) 01:18, 26 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
on the quantity of main page stuff[edit]
have there been any extensive (or at least noteworthy) discussions about how many things are listed in the news, on this day, and dyk sections of the main page, or was it just kind of silently agreed and moved on from?
this isn't really asking for examples of those discussions, just about whether or not there were any~ consarn (grave) (obituary) 11:25, 25 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The number of DYK items per set on the main page was discussed at length at WT:DYK before being increased from 8 to 9 recently, so I would expect there would be similar discussions on other main page project talk pages. TSventon (talk) 11:59, 25 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Thankspam[edit]
How is it possible that a brand-new user, never edited before, didn't even trip the filters, finds an RD1 I made three years ago, to thank me for it? See the Thanks log, 07:50, 25 September 2025. Weird--and that's before I ponder why they would have done that. Drmies (talk) 12:57, 25 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Drmies maybe you should ask User:ChaisakIn directly. I would guess it was a fat-finger. Mike Turnbull (talk) 13:03, 25 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Can such a new user even see the revdelete log? How would they find it? How would they know to find it? For an edit made three years ago? Drmies (talk) 13:06, 25 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Drmies It is fairly easy to find the revdelete log. An internet search finds Wikipedia:Revision deletion and that has a link to the log. You don't need to be logged in to see it. I suppose that searching for "Wikipedia Revision deletion" suggests a fairly high level of knowledge. Why is another question. Another new editor has made 200 thanks this morning, which is much spammier than just 1 thank. TSventon (talk) 13:31, 25 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
TSventon, thanks--I did not know that. And I'm not really interested in the "spammy" part--I'm more interested in "thanks" for purposes of trolling or intimidation. Drmies (talk) 13:55, 25 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Drmies, I think it could make sense to limit the thank function to editors with at least one edit, or perhaps autoconfirmed, as thanks from editors with no edits can feel like stalking. Also 200 thanks in one morning from an editor with no en Wikipedia edits looks like trolling.

Animal model of stroke[edit]
How do I check if my writing on this article has similar content to AI? I used a paraphrasing website and QuillBot to check for grammar mistakes and get some sentence-building ideas.
JGThinker2 (talk) 18:11, 25 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
You shouldn't be doing those things. Pleas write with your own words. Everybody gets stuck on how to phrase things, and that's fine. I write plenty of clumsy sentences, and usually it either gets fixed by another editor or I get an idea a week later on how to better phrase it. Cremastra (talk · contribs) 19:27, 25 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Why do I still get borders with style="text-align: left; border: NONE NONE NONE NONE;"[edit]
I've added some tables to Segment descriptor and want bit numbers on top without borders. I have border: NONE NONE NONE NONE; in the style, but I'm still getting all four borders.
I'm concern with four tables, but most likely I made the same error in all four, some I'm only presenting one example:

This removes the internal borders. The surrounding wikitable also has a border. To remove the left and right borders of the blank row you would have to remove the borders of both the row and the wikitable.

Context Is Not Whitewashing[edit]
I just had an edit quickly removed as “unhelpful.” Apparently, what was deemed unhelpful was my attempt to contextualise Hartwig’s membership in the Nazi Party — and my suggestion that it’s not reasonable for this to be the first thing someone reads about the artist on his page.
When someone like Josef Hartwig — a sculptor who created a formalist chess set in 1923 — is reduced to “Nazi Party member” in the opening line of his Wikipedia entry, it’s not history; it’s moral branding.
Why is Wikipedia so heavily policed, especially on anything even remotely connected to 20th-century politics, identity, or morality? Its self-appointed guardians appear to uphold a kind of presentist puritanism, particularly on the biographies of artists or thinkers with even the faintest whiff of political taint.
It’s all very ironic. They insist on a “neutral point of view,” but in practice, nuance is flattened and context becomes guilt by association. 125.168.135.116 (talk) 02:27, 26 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Don't be so quick to cast aspersions. Your edit wasn't labeled "unhelpful", it was simply reverted. And it was reverted likely because that's what many editors do when they see an anonymous IP address blank content without any explanation whatsoever, as you did. Next time use an edit summary. I have partially restored your edit. ~Anachronist (who / me) (talk) 02:55, 26 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
