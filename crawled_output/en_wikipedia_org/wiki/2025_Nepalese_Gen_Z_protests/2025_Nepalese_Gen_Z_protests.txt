In September 2025, large-scale anti-corruption protests and demonstrations took place across Nepal, predominantly organized by Generation Z students and young citizens.[7] Also known as "the Gen Z protests",[a][8] they began following a nationwide ban on numerous social media platforms, and they incorporated the public's frustration with corruption and display of wealth by government officials and their families, as well as allegations of mismanagement of public funds.[9][10] The movement expanded to encompass broader issues of governance, transparency, and political accountability.[11][12][13][14] The protests escalated, with violence against public officials and vandalism of government and political buildings taking place throughout the country.
On 9 September 2025, former king Gyanendra Shah called for calm and for a resolution be found internally.[15] On that same day, Prime Minister K. P. Sharma Oli, along with a few government ministers, resigned. On 12 September, Sushila Karki was appointed as interim prime minister of Nepal. The protests had died down by 13 September.[16][17]
Background[edit]
On 4 September 2025, the Government of Nepal ordered the shutdown of 26 social media platforms, including Facebook, X, YouTube, LinkedIn, Reddit, Signal, and Snapchat, for failing to register under the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology's new rules.[13] The registration requirement had been motivated in part as a way to enable the enforcement of a new Digital Services Tax and stricter value-added tax rules on foreign e-service providers in an effort to boost revenue.[18] However, critics alleged the shutdown was prompted by a social media trend highlighting nepotism, focusing on the undue privileges enjoyed by the children and relatives of influential political leaders.[19]
The significance of the media platform ban tied into Nepalese political economy. 33% of the Nepalese GDP comes from remittances, with hundreds of thousands of exit permits being issued, alongside 20% youth unemployment. These remittances keep thousands of households afloat and pay import bills, and also indicate a lack of structural transformation in the domestic economy toward an employment-first model, pushing the youth into work in online spaces.[18] Banning social media thus threatened youth livelihood.
Prior to the protests, the average Nepali citizen made US$1,400 per year, while families of the country's ruling elite displayed their wealth on social media.[20] This "Nepo Kid" trend prompted significant public anger, particularly from Generation Z users.[21][22] The median age of Nepal's population is 25, meaning that a large part of the population is in Gen Z, the age group that uses social media the most. Due to this, as well as the country's largely rural, rough terrain and substantial migration abroad, Nepal has some of the highest social media usage in South Asia, with nearly one account for every two people.[23]
Digital coordination[edit]
Youth participatory groups, particularly Hami Nepal[24] (a non-governmental organization), utilised Discord servers and Instagram channels as central organising tools in the Gen Z protests.[25] Anyone could join the Hami Nepal Discord group, making it vulnerable to trolls or people not living in Nepal.[26]
Discord channels reportedly contained tactical discussions, such as directing people toward the airport, organising the procurement or use of incendiary devices (e.g., Molotov cocktails), planning actions against police stations, and discussing disabling aeroplane tyres using acetylene gas.[5] After police response led to 19 deaths, organisers in some Discord servers asked members to stop attending classes. They called for an indefinite closure of colleges and schools until the government accepted accountability for the fatalities.[27]
As the protests grew in intensity, government officials and media sources reported that extremist rhetoric and calls for violent action emerged in certain online forums. Reports from Discord groups include messages advocating violence: instructions for protests to bring weapons, for attacks on politicians' residences, proposals for destructive acts against infrastructure, and suggestions for violent retaliation after fatalities.[28]
After Oli's resignation, the army's chiefs met with Hami Nepal and asked them to suggest nominees for an interim leader who would oversee national elections. More than 100,000 users met virtually in their Discord channel to debate. After discussions and several polls, the members settled on Sushila Karki. Shaswot Lamichhane, a channel moderator and recent high school graduate, said the discussions were meant to simulate a "mini-election".[26]
Timeline[edit]
8 September[edit]
Large gatherings took place in Kathmandu,[8] particularly at Maitighar Mandala and around the federal parliament building, New Baneshwor, with tens of thousands of participants.[29][30] The protests were organized as a peaceful rally by Hami Nepal,[5] an NGO[31][32] whose website highlights earthquake relief projects.[33] Anil Baniya, one of the protest organisers from Hami Nepal, argued that the government cracked down hard on the protesters after one of their own, Megraj Giri, threw a rock at a CCTV camera. Baniya stated that what had started out as a peaceful protest had been hijacked by "external forces and political party cadres" but that regardless, the government should not have responded to stones being thrown with live ammunition from the armed police.[20] The Straw Hat Pirates' Jolly Roger flag from the manga series One Piece was used by some protesters, in similar fashion to the 2025 Indonesian protests.[34]
The protest had no formal leadership, with individuals joining voluntarily to oppose corruption and the ban on social media. The demonstrations escalated when protesters attempted to enter the Federal Parliament of Nepal, leading security forces to respond with tear gas, water cannons, rubber bullets, and live ammunition.[contradictory][35] Later reports geolocating videos published in the evening showed numerous victims being killed in front of the parliament building. Some victims were seen lying inanimate on the ground, with many seriously or fatally injuries in wounds to the head and torso. Some videos showed victims with their faces blown off. An expert identified bullets fired as coming from a lightweight 7.62x51mm automatic rifle.[36] The Kathmandu District Administration Office imposed a curfew in parts of the capital near government buildings. However, protests continued.[20]
In the evening, the government lifted the ban on social media platforms.[37] Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak resigned.[38] A curfew was imposed in several major cities including Kathmandu, Birgunj, Bhairahawa, Butwal, Pokhara, Itahari, and Damak.[39] Following this, protests for the complete dissolution of parliament began. This was primarily caused by the initial government response to the original protests.[20]
The confrontations resulted in at least 19 people killed and more than 347 people injured.[40][35][41] Seventeen of those protesters were killed in the capital.[36]
9 September[edit]
Further information: 2025 storming of the Nepalese Parliament
After issuing a directive to his Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist–Leninist) ministers not to resign their posts, Prime Minister K. P. Sharma Oli resigned[1][42] and fled to an army barracks in Shivapuri at Budhanilkantha.[43] There were conflicting reports on whether President Ram Chandra Poudel resigned as well, as the Nepalese Army denied reports of Poudel's resignation.[44][45][46] Despite this, protests continued nationwide. Protestors set fire to many government buildings: part of Singha Durbar, the administrative headquarters of Nepal;[47] the adjacent building of the Supreme Court of Nepal;[48] the president's residence at Sital Niwas;[49][50][51] the prime minister's residence at Baluwatar;[52] and the headquarters of the Communist Party UML.[53] Multiple reports allege that Nepali Army commander Ashok Raj Sigdel advised Oli to resign in order for the Army to restore peace.[54]
Protest actions targeted several prominent locations in Kathmandu, including the residences of the prime minister and the president, as well as the homes of various government ministers and members of parliament, which were set ablaze by protesters.[55] The parliament building was set on fire.[56] The headquarters of the UML and Nepali Congress was vandalized, with party flags stripped and burned.[57] Security forces, including the Nepali Army, facilitated the safe evacuation of politicians from affected areas and evacuated to Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA), while attempting to control the escalating incidents of arson and destruction.[58][59] Minister of Agriculture Ram Nath Adhikari and Health Minister Pradip Paudel along with 21 MPs from the Rastriya Swatantra Party resigned,[60] along with all the MPs of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party.[61] Several members left Oli's UML party.[62] Protestors went to TIA to block the political leaders from fleeing. The airport was closed and occupied by the Nepali Army.[63][64] There was ensuing confusion as hundreds of travelers were left stranded in the TIA prompted airlines to order personnel to keep all individuals sheltered within the airport.[65][66] Scheduled international flights were diverted to Pokhara or cancelled.[67] Kantipur media house was set on fire in the early evening.[68] The online news portal was stopped due to damage in its server, forcing it to post in Facebook as an alternative.[69] Other buildings burned by protesters were the new Hilton Hotel in Kathmandu and the Ministry of Health building in Ramshahpath, the latter of which was designed by Louis Kahn.[70]
Several political leaders and their residences were attacked. Former prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba and his wife, foreign minister Arzu Rana Deuba, were injured while their house was set on fire. They were handed over to the police by protestors.[71] Deputy prime minister Prakash Man Singh's house and vehicle were set on fire,[72] followed by the house of former president Bidya Devi Bhandari at Bhangal, Kathmandu.[73] Former prime minister Jhala Nath Khanal's residence was also set on fire, injuring his wife Rajyalaxmi Chitrakar.[74] The residence of Ramesh Lekhak was also set on fire in Naikap, Kathmandu.[75] In Rupandehi district, the houses of local politicians Bal Krishna Khand, Bhoj Prasad Shrestha and several mayors were burned.[76] In Chitwan District, the house of former prime minister Prachanda was set on fire.[77] His daughter Ganga Dahal's house was also set on fire at Lalitpur. A person was found dead the next day in the house.[78] In Hetauda, several government offices were vandalized and set on fire.[79] In Karnali Province, the parliament building and the residence of chief minister Yam Lal Kandel was set on fire.[80][81] In Biratnagar, the capital of Koshi Province, the district office and district court were set on fire, followed by the residence of the chief minister and cabinet ministers.[82]
The prison in Kailali district was attacked by the protestors. All inmates fled.[83] Rabi Lamichhane was set free from the Nakhu Jail in Kathmandu, the prison was later set on fire; all prisoners fled.[84][85] Kaski prison was also set on fire, resulting in the escape of 773 inmates.[86] In Banke District, five inmates were killed after security forces opened fire during a jailbreak at a juvenile correctional facility.[87] The building of the Road Department was severely damaged after being set on fire by protestors,[88] along with the office of Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority.[89] The lower station of the Chandragiri Cable Car was also set on fire, along with the CG Electronics Digital Park, Balambu and Thankot Police Station.[90]
Several protesters were injured. Thirty-three were treated in the Teaching Hospital.[91] Three policemen died in Koteshwor.[92]
Curfew was imposed in several cities including Kathmandu, Birgunj, Bhairahawa, Butwal, Pokhara, Itahari, and Damak.[39] Additionally, the police and armed forces began going house-by-house near the protests searching for protesters, as well as raiding the Civil Service Hospital where wounded and dying protesters were taken after being shot or otherwise beaten by government forces.[20]
A football friendly between Nepal and Bangladesh was cancelled.[93]
Talks about restoring the monarchy re-emerged, with former king Gyanendra emerging as a "symbol of resistance for those disillusioned with the current political system", particularly from the royalist opposition to the post Nepali civil war governments. Earlier in the year, monarchists protested, calling for a restoration, ending with a heavy crackdown that caused at least two deaths.[94] However, organizers urged not to resurface pro-monarchy sentiment, nor hold the Nepali flag as they believed it was a royal form of "ultranationalism." Authors and scholars began to debate the actual intention of these comments, and whether protesters really wanted a restoration of the monarchy.[95]
At around 22:00 NPT, the Nepali Army stated that it would "take charge" of the country in the absence of the prime minister to ensure "law and order" is maintained.[96][97] The press release called for cooperation as they deployed troops later that evening into the early hours of the following day.[98] Later in the evening, the Chief of Army Staff Ashok Raj Sigdel appealed to the agitating groups for talks.[99]
10 September[edit]

In the early morning, Nepali Army forces were seen patrolling neighborhoods in critical areas.[100] General Sigdel again encouraged protesters to remain peaceful as the government attempts to restore peace.[65][101] Between approximately 10:00 NPT on 9 September and 22:00 NPT on 10 September, the Army announced detention of 27 individuals on counts of looting, arson, and other "destructive and anarchic activities" and seizing weaponry.[102] Later reports counted 31 firearms.[87]
In some places, protestors continued raiding government buildings and politicians' homes through the night, with one video showing a group of protestors taking firearms from homes, including what is believed to be a GSG-522 carbine and a bolt-action rifle.[87][103] The pace was slowed down by noon. A group of protestors started cleaning the street near the parliament building that was set on fire the previous day.[104] Many army weapons were captured by protesters. One video included armor vests, L1A1 SLR rifles, 37mm Webley & Scott "Schermuly" grenade launchers, INSAS 1B1 rifles, Lee–Enfield rifles, and Ishapore 1A1 rifles.[105]
Protestors held online discussions to select the interim leader. Around 10:00 pm NPT, the group voted and selected Sushila Karki.[106] Balen Shah and Kul Man Ghising were other candidates. Balen reportedly did not pick up the phone.[107] Durga Prasai separately met with the army chief, but no concrete conclusion was met.[108] Karki confirmed her willingness to accept the role in an interview with News18.[109]
In Pokhara, two dead bodies were found inside a burned house at Nayabazar and Lakeside.[104]
Police stated that as of 10 September, more than 13,500 prisoners had escaped from prisons nationwide.[110] Soldiers arrested 303 of those prisoners and handed them over to police. Seventy-three rifles were also returned.[78] In Dhading District, two inmates were shot dead and seven injured by soldiers when they tried to flee,[111] while soldiers also thwarted an attempted jailbreak in Kathmandu's main prison.[112]
TIA's closure was extended late in the morning, but eventually resumed operations.[87][113]
The New York Times reported that more than 100,000 citizens were using Discord, an online communication software, to select a nominee for interim leader. The server, described as "the Parliament of Nepal", had jumped to 145,000 members. The server had reportedly settled on Sushila Karki, the country's former chief justice, and proposed her name for meetings with the Army.[26]
11 September[edit]
In the morning a meeting was held that included President Poudel, General Sigdel and Gen Z representatives. The meeting was held at Bhadrakali army headquarters as part of efforts to select an interim leader. The Gen Z group was trying to promote Sushila Karki as interim prime minister. Other names under consideration included Balendra Shah, Kul Man Ghising, and mayor of Dharan, Harka Raj Rai.[114]
The Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre) announced its support for the protests, with party chairperson Pushpa Kamal Dahal urging protestors to work within the democratic framework.[115]
Meanwhile, the death toll increased to 34, while more than 1,300 people were injured, according to Nepal's Ministry of Health and Population (MoHP).[116]
12 September[edit]
The death toll reached 51, including 21 protesters, 9 prisoners, 3 police officers, and 18 others, with more than 1,300 people injured nationwide.[117][118]

Sushila Karki, a former Supreme Court chief justice, was inaugurated as interim prime minister, the first female prime minister in the history of Nepal.[119][120] Shortly afterwards, president Poudel dissolved parliament and set 5 March as the date for the next election.[121][122]
13 September[edit]
The curfew was lifted in the Kathmandu area.[123] Prime Minister Karki began visiting injured protesters in hospitals.[124] In the afternoon, calm was said to have been restored in the country.[125]
Aftermath[edit]
Casualties and emergency response[edit]
At least 72 people were killed in the protests,[126] with at least 2,113 injured.[127] Search teams were dispatched to recover bodies from all structures set on fire, according to the MoHP.[128] A day of national mourning for the victims was held on 17 September 2025.[129]
Protests destroyed numerous public offices, destroying equipment of essential services. Spared offices continued to operate normally while burned offices pitched tents and scrapped together materials to resume services.[130]
Interim government response[edit]
According to officials from Sushila Karki's interim government, any family who lost a member in the protests would receive monetary compensation of 1 million Nepalese rupees, maximum amount allowed by the law (equivalent to about US$7,000 as of September 2025).[131][132] Those who were injured during the protests would also be compensated. At the same meeting she called out for unity in order to rebuild the country.[120]
The day Karki took office, on 14 September, she "urged calm and cooperation to rebuild" following the protests.[133] She also condemned the destruction caused by protests and claimed that some of the arson was premeditated. She also criticised those who caused damage and pledged to investigate conspiracies behind the violence, intending to spare nobody.[134] Karki said that she would remain in power for no more than six months.[133]
Reactions[edit]
Domestic[edit]
Government[edit]
Former Minister of Justice Gobinda Bandi said the social media ban goes against the constitution and basic freedoms, including rights protected by Nepal's constitution and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).[135]
The Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP), part of the opposition, condemned the social media ban and the police response to the protests, and called for the immediate dissolution of the current government.[136]
In a Facebook post, Kathmandu's mayor Balendra Shah said he could not attend the protests because of the age limit set by the organizers. However, he believed it was important to listen to their voices.[137] President Ram Chandra Poudel and the Nepalese army appealed for calm and political dialogue.[138]
The National Human Rights Commission called on authorities not to use excessive force and to "show restraint in handling the protests."[139]
Others[edit]
Gyanendra, the former King of Nepal, issued a statement condemning the violent crackdown on the protests and calling on the government to listen to the demands of the protesters. He further urged the protest movement to remain peaceful and avoid being hijacked by criminal elements.[140]
International[edit]
Foreign governments[edit]
The unrest in Nepal impacted activities along the India–Nepal border. Local sources noted that markets had fallen silent, causing larger economic stagnation across neighbouring regions. Shortly after the worries, the Maharashtra State Emergency Operations Centre (SEOC) issued a travel advisory on 9 September requesting Indian citizens not to travel until further notice. It made emergency helplines available and encouraged both Indian and Nepali citizens in Nepal to also remain in place.[65][141] Early in the morning of 10 September, Air India, IndiGo, SpiceJet, and several other Indian airlines officially cancelled all flights in and out of Tribhuvan International Airport, commonly known as TIA.[65] After TIA was reopened later that day, IndiGo resumed flights.[142] However, sources from inside TIA reported that the airport was still at a standstill, with little communication of updates from authorities.[143]
India's Ministry of External Affairs said it was closely monitoring the protests, expressing grief over the casualties and extending condolences to the victims' families. It also wished a speedy recovery for the injured and advised Indian citizens in Nepal to follow curfew orders and safety guidelines.[144][145][146]
The Bangladeshi Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that it was closely monitoring the situation in Nepal, while expressing condolences to the families of the deceased and wishing recovery to the injured. It also stated that it hoped a "peaceful and constructive dialogue" among "all relevant parties" in the country to resolve any kind of differences.[147]
The military leader of Myanmar, Min Aung Hlaing, stated during a meeting with the State Security and Peace Commission that "[lessons should be learned from the] outside interference [in Nepal]."[148][149]
Intergovernmental organizations[edit]
United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres's spokesman, Stéphane Dujarric, said the secretary-general was "deeply saddened by the loss of life" and called on the authorities to comply with international human rights law and for the protestors to respect life and property.[150]
Volker Türk, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, said he was "appalled" by the escalating violence and called on the security forces to exercise the utmost restraint.[151] He also called for a investigation into conduct of the security forces, particularly the deaths of protestors and reports of "disproportionate use of force".[152]
Human rights groups[edit]
Amnesty International condemned the crackdown and called for independent investigation and accountability on 8 September. It called for a de-escalation while urging authorities to "exercise maximum restraint" in its use of force. It supported the protesters rights to protest peacefully and demanded the government heed the "legitimate demands of the youth to end corruption" to reestablish civil liberties.[153]
Human Rights Watch did not immediately make a statement on the protests, but suggested certain actions in a news report on 9 September. Its statements were supported by findings that the Nepali government has "a record of silencing online speech," which fueled growing discontent in younger population. Citing the ban's lifting and rampant militaristic police violence, it suggested that "Nepali authorities should promptly and impartially investigate the police use of force and appropriately discipline or prosecute all those responsible for abuses, regardless of rank." Its Asia director, Meenakshi Ganguly, underscored that the police shootings "shows the administration's appalling disregard for the lives of its own citizens and desperate need to suppress criticism." It further cited the UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms and tracking of the UN Human Rights Committee to argue that the government's use of live ammunition was extrajudicial.[154]
The International Federation for Human Rights and World Organisation Against Torture released a joint statement condemning the crackdown on peaceful protests on 9 September. It called for the government to "immediately halt all forms of violation and brutality by authorities against protesters," ensure that the ban rollback was permanent through legal means, and to uphold its state party status to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) by maintaining "respect [for] the fundamental rights of its people–both online and offline."[155]
