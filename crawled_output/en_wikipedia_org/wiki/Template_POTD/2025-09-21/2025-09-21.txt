Picture of the day
Tadej Pogačar (born 21 September 1998) is a Slovenian professional road cyclist who currently rides for UAE Team Emirates XRG, a UCI WorldTeam based in the United Arab Emirates. His victories include four Tours de France (2020, 2021, 2024 and 2025), the 2024 Giro d'Italia, and nine monuments (the Tour of Flanders twice, Liège–Bastogne–Liège three times, and the Giro di Lombardia four times), as well as the men's road race at the UCI Road World Championships.
Comfortable in time-trialing, one-day classic riding and grand-tour climbing, he has been compared to all-round cyclists such as Eddy Merckx and Bernard Hinault as one of the sport's greatest. This photograph shows Pogačar celebrating a stage victory in the 2022 Tour of Slovenia.Photograph credit: Petar Milošević
