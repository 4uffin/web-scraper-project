Sushila Karki[a] (born 7 June 1952) is a Nepalese politician and former jurist serving as the interim prime minister of Nepal since 12 September 2025, following the Gen Z-led protests.[1][2] She is the first woman to serve as Prime Minister of Nepal. Karki previously served as the chief justice of the Supreme Court of Nepal from 11 July 2016 to 6 June 2017, also the first woman to hold that office.[3][4]
Early life and education[edit]
Karki was born on 7 June 1952 to a Chhetri family from Sankarpur (later part of Biratnagar[5]), Nepal.[6][7] She is the eldest of her family's seven children.[8]
Karki attended Tribhuvan University, earning a Bachelor of Arts from Mahendra Morang College in 1972. She then studied political science in India, and in 1975 received a master's in political science from Banaras Hindu University. She returned to Tribhuvan University to study law, graduating in 1978.[9][6][10]
Career[edit]
Early years[edit]
From 1986 to 1989, Karki worked as assistant teacher at Mahendra Multiple Campus, Dharan; from 1988, she concurrently was the bar president of the Koshi Zonal Court until 1990.[6][5] That year, she participated in the 1990 People's Movement to overthrow the Panchayat regime and was imprisoned in Biratnagar Jail. She later wrote the novel Kara inspired by her experiences.[11] In 2002, she was made president of the Biratnagar Appellate Court, a role she held until 2004, when she became a senior Advocate at the Nepal Bar Association.[6][5]
Supreme Court of Nepal[edit]
Karki was appointed an ad hoc justice of the Supreme Court of Nepal in January 2009. Her position was made permanent the following year.[9][6] In March 2016, the Supreme Court heard a writ petition over the appointment of Khil Raj Regmi as interim Prime Minister. The court held that the petition, originally filed in 2013, was no longer relevant and dismissed it; Karki and Chief Justice Kalyan Shrestha dissented and found that the appointment of Regmi was unconstitutional. Karki later argued that Regmi's appointment had caused lasting damage to the Nepalese judiciary system.[12]
After the retirement of Chief Justice Shrestha in April 2016, Karki was recommended to take over the role by the Constitutional Council. She served on an ad hoc basis until a formal parliamentary hearing the following July confirmed her appointment.[8][6] She was the first female Chief Justice and known at the time of her appointment for being strict and anti-corruption.[13] She faced opposition for those attributes during her tenure, and was accused by the government of working against them after the Supreme Court overturned the appointment of Jaya Bahadur Chand as Chief of Nepal Police.[14][15][9] Impeachment proceedings, which became easier to initiate after the 2015 adoption of the Constitution,[16][12] were started against her in Parliament in April 2017 by Nepali Congress and CPN (Maoist Centre); she was automatically suspended.[9][15][17]
According to The Himalayan Times, the impeachment proceedings were viewed by many to be "politically motivated, intended to thwart the verdicts on some high-profile cases"[15] and United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein said that "the attempt to remove her gives rise to serious concerns about the Government's commitment to transitional justice and the rule of law".[18] Dissatisfied with decision to impeach her, the then deputy prime minister and home minister, Bimalendra Nidhi resigned[19][20] and the Rastriya Prajatantra Party left the coalition it had formed with Nepali Congress and CPN (MC).[17] In May, the Cholendra Shumsher Rana of the Supreme Court issued a stay against the proceedings.[15] Due to public pressure a deal was made during a cabinet reshuffle, and the ruling parties withdrew.[16][7] Karki resigned 6 June 2017 on reaching the mandatory retirement age of 65.[21]
After her retirement from the court, Karki wrote an autobiography about her early life and career as a judge. Published as Nyaya, Karki argued that democracy relied on the independence of the judiciary.[22] The next year, she published her novel Kara.[11]
Notable decisions[edit]

Prithivi Bahadur Pandey v. Kathmandu District Court (Corruption in the printing of polymer bank notes in Australia)[23]

Karki in US Nepal Summit for Democracy 2021
After the 2025 Generation Z-led anti-corruption protests forced Prime Minister K. P. Sharma Oli to resign, an interim government was needed and Karki's name was suggested by some activists due to her political neutrality.[27] Following a poll on the online communication platform Discord, protester server members selected Karki out of five options.[28] The appointment was agreed upon during talks with the Nepalese army.[29][28][30]
Upon her recommendation, president Ram Chandra Poudel dissolved the Federal Parliament of Nepal on 12 September,[30][31] and Karki was sworn in as interim Prime Minister based on article 61 of the Constitution of Nepal.[32][33] She unveiled her cabinet beginning 15 September 2025.[34] She is the first woman in Nepal's history to hold the position.[30]
Personal life[edit]
She married Durga Prasad Subedi, who as a youth wing leader of Nepali Congress was one of the perpetrators behind the 1973 Royal Nepal Airlines DHC-6 hijacking.[26][29][35][36] They met while studying in Banaras Hindu University,[37] and he was her tutor.[26] They have at least one child.[35]
In addition to her native Nepali, Karki speaks some Hindi and English.[9][6]
