From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Beginning in 1829, every class (promotion) of the École spéciale militaire de Saint-Cyr has chosen a name by which it is known. It can be a nickname, the anniversary of a famous battle, a current event, or the name of a famous soldier or general.
Naming[edit]
Statuette of the promotion of Djurjura (1856–1858)
Memorial to the Saint-Cyriens of the Montmirail promotion (1912–1914)
Beginning in 1829, every class (promotion) of the École spéciale militaire de Saint-Cyr has chosen a name. It can be a nickname (du Firmament, "of the Stars", for the first one); the anniversary of a famous battle, like the Centenaire de Camerone for the 1962–1964 class; a current event, like Sevastopol for the 1855–1856 class; or the name of a famous soldier or general like Bayard for 1923–1925 class or Général Louis Charles Antoine Desaix for the 2024–2027 class. Often this commemorates the recent death of a notable Saint-Cyrian like Maréchal Juin (promotion de Fès, 1909–1912) who died in 1967 and whose name was adopted by the 1966–1968 class, or Général Leclerc (promotion de Metz et Strasbourg, 1922–1924), who died in 1947 and whose name was adopted by the 1946–1948 class. Generally, when a class is named after a person, that person is dead. Only two classes were named after a living person: Jean-Baptiste Marchand (1898–1900) and Philippe Pétain (1940–1942).[1][2]
From the mid 19th-century there was a trend for classes to take names inspired by the French colonies. During this time the Troupes de marine and Troupes coloniales were seen as more prestigious than the metropolitan army and graduating cadets often chose to serve in these branches (previously these branches had been unpopular and often took the lowest ranked cadets of each year). Half of all class names between the 1870s and the start of the First World War had colonial roots.[3]
Since 1982, schooling lasts for three years, and the name of the promotion is chosen at the end of the first year (3rd Battalion), before entry into the second year (2nd Battalion). The battalion proposes several names to the Chief of Staff of the French Army, who makes the selection, but the battalion commander, a regular officer, is often influential in providing advice, opinions, ideas, or proposals.[1][2] The symbology section of the Defence Historical Service (SHD) in Vincennes is also consulted on the choice of name. The process is not foolproof; in 2018 the army had to reverse itself over naming the 2016–2019 class after General Georges Loustaunau-Lacau, a hero of the Second World War, but also a notorious antisemite, after a public outcry.[4][5]
The SHD had raised concerns over the selection of this name for a class but had been overruled. The process has now been reformed so that the SHD carries out in depth research into the namesakes proposed.[4]
Wartime classes[edit]
Saint-Cyr closed on 2 August 1914 due to the outbreak of World War I. In April 1915, it became the Centre d’Instruction d’Élèves Aspirants (CIEA) (Training Center for Officer Cadets), which was closed in November 1918. The CIEA trained four wartime classes: des Drapeaux et de l'Amitié Américaine (1916–1917), de Sainte Odile (1917–1918), La Fayette (1917–1918) and Victoire (1918–1920). In June 1940, with the German Army bearing down on Paris, the school left its original site at the Saint-Cyr-l'École and never returned. From November 1940 to November 1942, the school was located in Aix-en-Provence alongside the École Militaire d’Infanterie (Infantry School), and two promotions came from there:
Charles de Foucauld (1941–1942) and Maréchal Pétain (1940–1942).[1]
Meanwhile, Général de brigade Charles de Gaulle (promotion de Fès, 1909–1912) created the Military School of Cadets of Free France in the autumn of 1940. Initially located at Rake Manor, near Milford, Surrey, it subsequently moved to Malvern, Worcestershire, and then to Ribbesford Castle, where it was dissolved on 15 June 1944. Under Law No. 54-292 of 18 March 1954, former students who have passed the exit examinations are considered, in all respects, to have graduated from Saint-Cyr. The school produced five promotions: Liberation (June 1942), Bir Hakeim (December 1942), Fezzan-Tunisia (June 1943), Corsica and Savoy (December 1943) and 18 June (June 1944).[1]
Saint-Cyr was dissolved when the Germans invaded the zone libre in November 1942 and re-created in Algeria on 15 December 1942, as the École d’Élèves Aspirants de Cherchell (Cherchell School of Officer Cadets), which was renamed the École Militaire Interarmes (Joint Military School) on 13 December 1944. Three promotions came from there: Croix de Provence (1942), Veille au Drapeau (1943) and Rome [fr; it] et Strasbourg (1944).||[1]
After the war French Army officers of the Maréchal Pétain promotion raised concerns over their namesake, the collaborationist Philippe Pétain, but were advised by Charles de Gaulle that the naming was a historic moment in the life of a cadet and should not be altered thereafter.[6]

The class members had been recalled from leave in 1938 because of the German annexation of Sudetenland and at Easter 1939 because of the Italian invasion of Albania. They were recalled on 22 August 1939 as a result of the Danzig crisis and called to active service after the French declaration of war on Germany following the 1 September invasion of Poland.

[34]
121
1934–1936
du Roi Alexandre 1er de Yougoslavie
"King Alexander I of Yugoslavia" who was assassinated in Marseille on 9 October 1934 during a state visit to France. In 1935 a Yugoslav government delegation visited the academy to mark the assassination. A detachment of Serbian cadets presented each French cadet with a badge in memory of Alexander I. This received retrospective approval by the ministry of war and is now regarded as the first class insignia.
[35]

du Rif
The class was originally to have been named after General Charles Mangin who died in May 1925. Mangin's support for the establishment of a Rhenish Republic in French-occupied Germany was opposed by the Minister of War Paul Painlevé who vetoed the name. General Albert Tanant [fr] formally named the class du Rif in June 1925. This name was chosen to reflect the Rif War in Spanish Morocco, in which France intervened earlier that year. The choice was controversial as the war was going badly at the time and the class did not want to carry the name of a defeat.
[42]

[50]
107
1920–1922
de la Devise du Drapeau
"The flag motto" in recognition of the motto Ils s’instruisent pour vaincre ("They study to vanquish") that was added to the school flag on 3 December 1921. This motto had been used by the school during the First French Empire.
[51]

[52]
105

de la Garde au Rhin
"The Guard on the Rhine" in recognition of the restoration of Alsace, whose border with Germany was the Rhine river, to France. The class, which included 104 new entrants as well as the 41 remaining from the 104th class, had requested to be named after General Édouard de Castelnau, an army group commander during the First World War. Castelnau declined the honour and suggested the class name themselves after the new border.
[53]
104
1919–1920
des Croix de Guerre 1914–1918
"The Crosses of War" after the Croix de Guerre medal that was held by almost all of those in this class. Many officers who joined during the First World War had no opportunity to take the school entrance exams when classes resumed in 1916. Instead at the war's end some 1,000 veterans with temporary commissions attended a four-month course at the army's non-commisisoned officer school. Afterwards 291 were admitted to Saint-Cyr; the 250 who had held temporary officer commissions graduated 8 July 1920 while the remainder, former NCOs, graduated in the 105th class in 1921.
[54]
103

[55]
102
1917–1918
La Fayette
"La Fayette" after the French name of Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette, a French officer who fought in the American War of Independence and the French Revolution. The class selected the name as they graduated in July 1918 and Lafayette was famous for his role in the 1830 July Revolution.
[56]
101
1917–1918
de Sainte Odile
"Saint Odile", in honour of the patron saint of Alsace, which it was hoped to reclaim during the First World War. This class was admitted to the school simultaneously with that of the 102nd class but had received around 4 months prior instruction by veteran officers and non-commissioned officers at regimental depots. They were split into separate platoons at the school and the 101st class graduated early, on 20 February 1918.
[56]
100
1916–1917
des drapeaux et de l'amitié Américaine
"Flags and American friendship". This class was the first to graduate during the war. It participated in the 14 July 1917 parade in Paris to mark the American entry into the war. The school flag was carried by this class at the parade and the class desired to take this name. The school authorities preferred a name that related to the United States to mark financial contributions made by American citizens to the families of St Cyr graduates killed during the war. A combined name was assigned but, feeling that it had been imposed upon them the class opted to be known unofficially as the Centième (the "hundreth") after their class number.

1914
de la Grande Revanche
"The great revenge" after the revanchist movement in France that sought to restore the province of Alsace-Lorraine, lost after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71. This class did not formally enter the academy, having only sat their entry examination and being partway through the entry interviews when the First World War broke out in July 1914. The cadets were instead sent to regimental depots immediately where they received intensive instruction, before being appointed as second lieutenants in December 1914; though some managed to arrange earlier postings. Lacking the usual naming ceremony this class was formally named by Général de Division Louis de Garnier des Garets, president of the academy, in January 1915. The survivors of this class returned to the academy after the war to complete their course, alongside the 98th class.

This class graduated early (after just ten months instructed) to be commissioned as second lieutenants due to the outbreak of the First World War. The class returned after the war to formally complete their training at the academy,
[60]
97
1912–1914
de Montmirail
"Montmirail" to mark the 1814 battle where Napoleon defeated Russian and Prussian force.

This class graduated in 1914, after two years training, as part of a transition into the new system.

90 bis (additional)
1906–1908
des Cinq
"The five".
A change of policy was implemented on 21 March 1905 which required officer candidates to serve one year in the army before joining the academy. The first year was considered their initial class year so subsequently all classes became three years long rather than two. In the class of 1906 five candidates had already served and so were permitted to join the academy as a special case. They completed their studies alongside 90th and 91st classes and were commissioned as second lieutenants in 1908 (the only officers to graduate from the school in that year). The 1912 academy yearbook defines the five as a separate class but subsequent directories list them as part of the 91st class. The Saint Cyrienne historical association refers to it as the 90th bis (additional) class.

In compensation graduates were required to spend one less year in the rank of second lieutenant before being promoted. The class of 1905–1907 were the last to follow the old system and took this name in recognition. Subsequent classes were considered to be of three years duration (counting the year spent with the army), rather than two years as previous.

This was the first numbered class. Classes, totalling thousands of students, had graduated the academy since its foundation in 1803. However information on the early years is scarce. The academy was dissolved in 1814 after Napoleon's defeat in the War of the Sixth Coalition; it was refounded during Napoleon's return in the Hundred Days (1815) but dissolved once more after his defeat at the Battle of Waterloo. The academy was formally reconstituted by Marshal Laurent de Gouvion Saint-Cyr in 1818 to provide officers for the new army of the Kingdom of France. The numbering of classes started from this point.
