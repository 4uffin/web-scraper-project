The Studio is an American satirical cringe comedy television series created by Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg, Peter Huyck, Alex Gregory, and Frida Perez. It stars Rogen as an embattled Hollywood studio head struggling to balance corporate demands with his own passion for producing quality films. Catherine O'Hara, Ike Barinholtz, Chase Sui Wonders, and Kathryn Hahn play supporting roles. The series was released on Apple TV+ with the first two episodes on March 26, 2025.[6] The series has been renewed for a second season.[7]
Praised for its direction, cinematography, humor, and sharp satire of the film industry, the show quickly earned critical acclaim. Viewers and critics have highlighted its extensive use of long takes,[8] as well as for featuring high-profile celebrity cameos in every episode. In its first season, the show earned 23 nominations at the 77th Primetime Emmy Awards, making it the most-nominated comedy debut in history and tying the record for the most nominations for a single comedy season.[9] It went on to win 13 Emmys from those nominations (including Outstanding Comedy Series and
Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series for Rogen), breaking the record for most wins for a comedy series in a single season. The season also received the Television Critics Association Award for Outstanding Achievement in Comedy.
Premise[edit]
Matt Remick is the newly appointed head of the floundering film production company Continental Studios. A self-described cinephile, Matt struggles to balance Continental's corporate aims in an increasingly IP-driven entertainment landscape with his own ambition to produce quality films.

Matt Remick is a studio executive at Continental Studios who still believes in artistic integrity in an increasingly IP-based industry. He gets a long-awaited promotion to studio head after his mentor, Patty Leigh, is fired at the behest of new CEO Griffin Mill. Griffin offers him the job as long as he greenlights a movie based on the Kool-Aid Man, so Matt reluctantly agrees. Figuring that the best route is to hire a good director, he handpicks Nicholas Stoller. Matt then learns Martin Scorsese and Steve Buscemi have written a script about the Jonestown massacre and decides to use that as the Kool-Aid film instead. However, Matt's idea gets pushback from fellow exec Sal Saperstein and head of marketing Maya Mason, so he chooses to go with Stoller's idea after a meeting with Griffin, claiming he bought Scorsese's script to kill his project. To rehire Stoller, Matt visits Patty, who agrees after bargaining a lucrative deal to produce her own movies. At a party hosted by Charlize Theron, Matt and Sal break the news to Scorsese that his project, intended to be his final film, will never be made; a scorned Scorsese rebukes Matt and breaks down into tears, and Theron kicks Matt and Sal out.
2"The Oner"Seth Rogen & Evan GoldbergPeter HuyckMarch 26, 2025 (2025-03-26)
Matt and Sal head over to the set of The Silver Lake, a romantic drama film directed by Sarah Polley and starring Greta Lee, hoping to see them shoot a oner at sunset, which can only be shot that day due to time constraints. Both filmmakers want something from Matt: Polley needs money to play "You Can't Always Get What You Want" over the scene, and Lee wants to use one of the studio's private jets during the press tour. Patty and Sal try to get Matt off the set, fearing he will obstruct the cast and crew. Polley, wishing to please Matt, acquiesces to one of his propositions for the scene, which causes the crew to lose valuable time and the first take to be ruined. Matt further ruins other takes by speaking too loud while at the video village, accidentally appearing on camera, and getting injured. A seemingly perfect take gets ruined when Lee cannot exit the driveway of the set due to Matt's car being parked in front of hers; Polley promptly expels him from the set. Matt and Sal drive off as night falls and get a text that the crew was ultimately unable to get the shot.
3"The Note"Seth Rogen & Evan GoldbergSeth Rogen & Evan GoldbergApril 2, 2025 (2025-04-02)
The team's excitement of watching a preview screening of Ron Howard's new film Alphabet City turns sour due to a meandering final sequence at a motel, which all agree should be cut. Howard's early arrival at the studio for a marketing meeting provides an opportunity for Matt to deliver the note, but Matt is reluctant to do so due to a traumatic experience when he offered feedback for A Beautiful Mind that led to Howard mocking him. Patty's revelation that the motel sequence is a tribute to Howard's late cousin complicates matters, with Quinn, Sal, and later Anthony Mackie (the film's star and producer) failing to tell Howard. Maya informs the team that keeping the movie's length as it is will reduce the number of screenings and cut its revenue. At the meeting, Maya mentions that Matt has feedback, prompting Howard to bring up the A Beautiful Mind story. A humiliated Matt snaps at Howard about the boring nature of the motel sequence, to which Howard responds aggressively. Later that night, Matt receives a phone call from Howard, who apologizes and agrees to cut the sequence while also threatening to destroy Matt if he were to ever cross him again.
4"The Missing Reel"Seth Rogen & Evan GoldbergPeter HuyckApril 9, 2025 (2025-04-09)
Matt's support of film forces him to scrap the wrap party of Olivia Wilde's neo-noir detective movie after it goes overbudget. After a reel containing an expensive sequence is presumed stolen, Matt and Sal scurry to locate it to avoid reshooting. They suspect lead actor Zac Efron and find an envelope of cash in his trailer addressed to costume designer Evelyn, who retrieves it and exchanges it with a man with a wrist tattoo for a box. Evelyn heads to the Chateau Marmont, with Efron arriving soon after to an invitation-only event. Sal leaves, but Matt sees him returning. Matt sneaks in to find Efron throwing a secret wrap party, and discovers Evelyn's box just contains custom-made hats for the crew. Matt and Sal reconcile and notice extras with the fake wrist tattoo, which Wilde also had after shooting a cameo. After Efron reveals Wilde was unhappy with the scene on the missing reel, Matt and Sal deduce she stole it. They confront her near the Hollywood Sign where she is directing pick-up shots, and she confesses to stealing it to force reshoots. After a chase, Wilde destroys the reel by letting it roll downhill. Matt is forced to sell his car to Efron to pay for the reshoots.
5"The War"Seth Rogen & Evan GoldbergFrida PerezApril 16, 2025 (2025-04-16)
Sal is trying to get Smile director Parker Finn to direct a slasher film entitled Wink, while Quinn wants to bring in Owen Kline for his own similar project. Matt opts for Wink but agrees to meet with both directors. Feeling disrespected by Sal, Quinn erases Finn's scheduled meeting from Matt's assistant's computer, causing Matt to miss it for a different meeting with Chris Hemsworth. In retaliation, Sal crashes Kline's meeting and scares him off with the prospect of studio pressure. Quinn strikes back by stealing Sal's assistant Daniel's golf cart to block Sal's reserved parking spot, causing a series of mishaps that ruins Sal's suit and makes him miss a rescheduled meeting with Finn. Sal chases Quinn and throws her burrito at her, inadvertently hitting an assistant director driving a golf cart, who crashes and destroys Netflix's Waterloo miniseries set. When human resources investigates the incident, Quinn sees an opportunity to get Sal fired and take his job. Fearing it will destroy his life, Sal cries; Quinn relents, agreeing to play along with his cover story for the investigation if he gives her his parking spot and helps her movies get made. Having reconciled, they meet to discuss directors for Wink.
6"The Pediatric Oncologist"Seth Rogen & Evan GoldbergAlex GregoryApril 23, 2025 (2025-04-23)
Matt accompanies his new pediatric oncologist girlfriend, Sarah, to the Ebell for a Cedars-Sinai Medical Center fundraiser to benefit children with cancer. He becomes dismayed by Sarah and her colleagues' dismissive attitudes towards cinema and his job, particularly Duhpocalypse!, Continental's upcoming Spike Jonze-directed satire starring Johnny Knoxville and Josh Hutcherson and featuring scatological humor. In a power play during the charity auction, Matt outbids Sarah's friends, who were hoping to win a golfing vacation at Royal County Down Golf Club with Scottie Scheffler that Matt has no interest in, angering Sarah. Matt apologizes and offers to gift them the prize if they agree that movies are as important as medicine. They refuse, and an agitated Matt trips over while monitoring the in-progress Duhpocalypse! trailer edits on his phone, breaking his right pinkie and passing out before he is loaded into an ambulance without Sarah. While recuperating at home, Matt hooks up with Knoxville's agent Leigh, who is more knowledgeable about movies but less enthusiastic about him.
7"Casting"Seth Rogen & Evan GoldbergAlex GregoryApril 30, 2025 (2025-04-30)
Concerned that casting Ice Cube as the voice of the Kool-Aid Man may play into stereotypes of African Americans, the team solicits feedback. Quinn says it's not a problem since Kool-Aid is more of a poor people's drink; Tyler says not having a Black man as the Kool-Aid Man is racist; and Ziwe and Lil Rel Howery say it would be racist if Mrs. Kool were not also voiced by a Black woman, leading to Regina King replacing Sandra Oh in the cast. As this makes the live action cast all White, Don Cheadle and Keke Palmer replace Josh Duhamel and Jessica Biel. Screenwriters Dev and Sandra quit, feeling Black writers should rework the script for the now all-Black cast. Stoller decides to rewrite and hire an AI animation company to ensure the movie stays within budget and deadline. Further debate about representation prompts Matt to consult Ice Cube, who sees no problem with it. The Kool-Aid Movie lead announcement at Anaheim Comic-Con is rapturously received until an audience member asks about the use of AI animation. Stoller runs away to avoid answering and Ice Cube walks out in disgust, leaving Matt to face the crowd's booing alone.
8"The Golden Globes"Seth Rogen & Evan GoldbergAlex GregoryMay 7, 2025 (2025-05-07)
At the Golden Globe Awards, Matt fears not being thanked by director Zoë Kravitz for greenlighting her Patty-produced nominated movie Open, even though she seems ambivalent about potentially winning. Matt grows insecure due to other studio heads like Ted Sarandos being thanked; Sal also becomes the star of the show after Adam Scott thanking him for letting him sleep on his couch 20 years ago turns into a recurring joke throughout the evening via host Ramy Youssef's banter and speeches by Quinta Brunson, Jean Smart, and Aaron Sorkin. Matt tries to dupe the teleprompter operator into adding his name to Kravitz's acceptance speech but she catches him, revealing she is actually serious about winning and will not change her well-rehearsed speech for Matt, despite his pleading that it would impress his mother. When Open wins, Kravitz thanks Patty and Sal, but her mic cuts out as she thanks Matt, making it inaudible. Though the post-show mood is celebratory with Kravitz and her agent Mitch Weitz finally agreeing to make her next movie, Blackwing, at Continental, Matt gets in his limo and goes home deflated.
9"CinemaCon"Seth Rogen & Evan GoldbergAlex GregoryMay 14, 2025 (2025-05-14)
While preparing in Las Vegas for the presentation of Continental's upcoming slate of films at CinemaCon, Griffin is distracted by the studio's potential sale to Amazon, which would lead to massive changes and lay-offs. Matt convinces him that a strong presentation will prevent the sale. At Matt's hotel suite pre-event party, the 82-year-old Griffin's inebriation with Dave Franco worries the team, who, sober Patty excepted, are also high on potent mushroom chocolates and other drugs. Zöe Kravitz's arrival halts Matt's attempt at ending the party to stop Griffin, and they have to take care of her after she unknowingly ingests the mushrooms. When Griffin goes missing, they search for him as he wanders through the downstairs casino, finally finding him outside by the canal. While they debate cancelling Griffin's speech, he falls onto a gondola and drifts back to the Venetian, where he alights and is found by Patty, whose lingering resentment over Griffin firing her is triggered by his rudeness. She borrows a phone to anonymously call journalist Matt Belloni.
10"The Presentation"Seth Rogen & Evan GoldbergSeth Rogen & Evan Goldberg & Peter Huyck & Alex Gregory & Frida PerezMay 21, 2025 (2025-05-21)
As Griffin frolics and passes out on the Venetian fountain, Patty has a change of heart when the team tells her of Amazon's potential Continental takeover. With CinemaCon starting soon, they disguise Griffin and sneak him Weekend at Bernie's-style past Matt Belloni to get ready in the suite along with Zöe Kravitz. Although most of them are still high on mushrooms, their presentation begins with Dave Franco introducing Alphabet City in character which disguises his bloodied state from getting beat up in the casino. Patty buys time with her The Silver Lake speech while the team convince Kravitz's agent Mitch and publicist Gabby to let her present Blackwing, which she nails before wetting herself backstage. As Nicholas Stoller presents The Kool-Aid Movie, Griffin is still in no shape for his speech, so Matt addresses the crowd while Maya prepares Griffin. Matt brings out the team to pay tribute to them, then introduces Griffin who drops down to the stage via wires. When Griffin is only able to utter "movies" repeatedly, Matt turns it into a back-and-forth chant with the audience as the team – including Griffin who dances while suspended by the wires – ends the presentation triumphantly.
