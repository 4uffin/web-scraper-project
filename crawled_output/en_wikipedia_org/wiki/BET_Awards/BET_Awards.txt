American entertainment award show
BET AwardsCurrent: BET Awards 2025A BET Award from 2018Awarded forOutstanding achievements in the entertainment industryCountryUnited StatesPresented byBETFirst awardJune 19, 2001; 24 years ago (2001-06-19)Websitehttp://www.bet.com/shows/bet-awards.html
The BET Awards are an American award show that was established in 2001 by the Black Entertainment Television network to celebrate Black entertainers and other minorities in music, film, sports and philanthropy.[1] The awards, which are presented annually, are broadcast live on BET. The annual presentation ceremony features performances by artists; some of the awards of more popular interest are presented in a televised ceremony.
Trophy[edit]
The Award Trophy, inspired by three words - aspire, ascend, achieve, was designed by artist/sculptor Carlos "Mare139" Rodriguez.[2] Outkast won the first award trophy during the first ceremony in 2001. In 2007, Society Awards, the New York firm who manufactures the award, enhanced the quality of the trophy design using plated steel and black crystal.
List of ceremonies[edit]
The inaugural ceremony in 2001 was held at the Paris Las Vegas resort on the Las Vegas Strip. From 2002 to 2005, the Kodak Theatre in Hollywood hosted the awards. From 2006 to 2012, the ceremonies were held at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles. Since 2013 the ceremony has been held at the Peacock Theater at L.A. Live (previously Nokia Theatre and Microsoft Theater)

Nomination process[edit]
The nomination process is handled by a voting academy made up of about 500 people from the music industry, involving the media, and bloggers. BET sends out ballots electronically and voters nominate deserving works and artists in all categories who they think should be nominated. Nominations and voting ballots are collated by Yangaroo, Inc., a leading digital distribution firm that works on many other televised award ceremonies, including those of BET's sister networks under parent company Paramount Global. The top nominees are determined in each category, and the winners are selected via the academy members' voting process.[27][28][29]
