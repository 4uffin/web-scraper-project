Dream Park is an amusement park located on Oasis Road, in 6th of October City in Giza Governorate, 8 km (5.0 mi) from the Pyramids of Giza. It is considered one of the largest amusement parks in the Middle East, where it was built on an area of 150 acres (61 ha). It is one of Ahmed Bahgat's projects. It was opened in 1999 and was designed by the Canadian company Forrec, which designed Universal Studios.[1] Dream Park can accommodate 30,000 visitors daily and includes a wide range of different entertainment games for all ages.[2][1]
Dream Park is part of the city of Dreamland, which consists of a commercial mall, Dream Cinema, golf courses, Pegasus Club, Equestrian Club, Hilton Dream Hotel, Helnan Hotel, and the Swiss Inn Hotel. The city is located on the Oasis Road, in the city of 6th of October in Giza Governorate, 8 km from the Pyramids of Giza are faced by the city of Al-Fardous, the tree district, the city of media production and the Mövenpick Hotel, and it is very close to Al-Ahram Gardens, Sheikh Zayed City, Cairo–Alexandria desert road and Smart Village.[1]
