Selection of films for preservation in the US Library of Congress
National Film RegistryLogo for the National Film Registry.Founded1988; 37 years ago (1988)United StatesTypeFilm preservationWebsiteloc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry
The National Film Registry (NFR) is the United States National Film Preservation Board's (NFPB) collection of films selected for preservation, each selected for its cultural, historical, and aesthetic contributions since the NFPB's inception in 1988.[1][2]
History[edit]
Throughout the 1980s, several prominent filmmakers and industry personalities in the United States, such as Frank Capra and Martin Scorsese, advocated for Congress to enact a film preservation bill in order to avoid commercial modifications (such as pan and scan and editing for TV) of classic films, which they saw as negative. In response to the controversy over the colorization of originally black and white films in the decade specifically, Representatives Robert J. Mrazek and Sidney R. Yates introduced the National Film Preservation Act of 1988, which established the National Film Registry, its purpose, and the criteria for selecting films for preservation.[3] The Act was passed and the NFR's mission was subsequently reauthorized by further acts of Congress in 1992, 1996, 2005, 2008, and 2016.[4][5][6][7] The National Film Preservation Board's mission, to which the NFR contributes, is to ensure the survival, conservation, and increased public availability of America's film heritage.[8] The 1996 law also created the non-profit National Film Preservation Foundation which, although affiliated with the NFPB, raises money from the private sector.[9]
Selection criteria[edit]
Taken together, the ... films in the National Film Registry represent a stunning range of American filmmaking—including Hollywood features, documentaries, avant-garde and amateur productions, films of regional interest, ethnic, animated, and short film subjects—all deserving recognition, preservation and access by future generations. As we begin this new millennium, the registry stands among the finest summations of American cinema's wondrous first century.
—Doctor James H. Billington, Librarian of Congress.[10]
The NFPB adds to the NFR up to 25 "culturally, historically or aesthetically significant films" each year in December, showcasing the range and diversity of American film heritage to increase awareness for its preservation.[10] A film becomes eligible for inclusion ten years after its original release.[11] For the first selection in 1989, the public nominated almost 1,000 films for consideration. Members of the NFPB then developed individual ballots of possible films for inclusion. The ballots were tabulated into a list of 25 films that was then modified by Librarian of Congress James H. Billington and his staff at the Library for the final selection.[10] Since 1997, members of the public have been able to nominate up to 50 films a year for the NFPB and Librarian to consider,[12] with an August submission deadline.
The NFR includes films ranging from Hollywood classics to orphan films.[13] A film is not required to be feature-length, nor is it required to have been theatrically released in the traditional sense. The Registry contains newsreels, silent films, student films, experimental films, short films, music videos, films out of copyright protection or in the public domain, film serials, home movies, documentaries, animation and independent films. As of the 2024 listing, there are 900 films in the Registry.

Age of Registry selections[edit]
The oldest film in the registry, Newark Athlete, was released in 1891, while the most recent, 12 Years a Slave, was released in August 2013.
Time span from release to selection[edit]
Released in 1895, and selected in December 2024, Annabelle Serpentine Dance experienced the longest wait, at 129 years (although considering the fact that the film was already almost a century old before the Registry was even established, the "wait" was technically only 35 years), while Raging Bull, released theatrically in the United States on December 19, 1980, and inducted in October 1990, holds the record for the shortest delay, having been inducted slightly shy of the 10-year minimum.[29] Only eight other films have been inducted at the 10-year mark: Do the Right Thing,[53] Goodfellas,[54] Toy Story,[55] Fargo,[56] 13 Lakes,[57] Freedom Riders,[58] 12 Years a Slave and 20 Feet from Stardom.[59]
Franchises with multiple entries[edit]
While most film franchises have at most one entry in the registry, some have two or more. These include sequels, remakes, or adaptations of the same source material.

Directors with multiple entries (two or more)[edit]
Academy Award–winning director John Ford has the most entries with 11 films.
Master of Suspense Alfred Hitchcock, responsible for inductees ranging from the 1940 Academy Award for Best Picture winner Rebecca to 1963's The Birds.
Orson Welles, acclaimed filmmaker behind inductees Citizen Kane (1941), The Magnificent Ambersons (1942), The Lady from Shanghai (1948) and Touch of Evil (1958).
Stanley Kubrick, master auteur responsible for inductees ranging from 1957's Paths of Glory to his 1980 adaptation of Stephen King's The Shining.
Aside from animated shorts/features by producer Walt Disney alongside multiple directors, animator Dave Fleischer has the most animated titles on the Registry with four (some featuring timeless characters Koko the Clown, Betty Boop and Popeye).
