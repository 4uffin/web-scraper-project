LocationKembanganKembangan Mass Rapid Transit station in Singapore
Kembangan MRT station[a] is an above-ground Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) station on the East–West Line in Bedok, Singapore. Operated by SMRT Trains, the station serves the eponymous Kembangan subzone of Bedok. Other nearby landmarks include the Kembangan Community Club (Kembangan CC) and the Masjid Kassim.
First announced in May 1982 as Frankel, it was to be constructed as part of Phase II of the MRT system. The name was later changed in 1983. To construct the station, Kampongs Kembangan and Pachitan were acquired. It commenced operations on 17 December 1988 along with the other stations on the Tanah Merah–Pasir Ris Stations stretch. Half-height platform screen doors and high-volume low-speed fans were installed by August 2011 and the first quarter of 2013, respectively. The station along with other stations in the eastern portion of the EWL was temporarily closed on 21 and 28 January 2018 for checks on a new rail signalling system.
Like other stations of the Tanah Merah–Pasir Ris stretch, the station has a domed roof design. As a part of a heritage-themed art exhibition, there are two murals by students from St. Joseph's Institution displayed in the station, which details the history of nearby landmarks.
History[edit]
The exterior of Kembangan station
Kembangan station was first included in the early plans of the MRT system as Frankel station in May 1982 and was later announced to be part of Phase II of the MRT as Kembangan station in October 1983.[7][8] There were several joint ventures between companies that prequalified for Contract 303 and 304 by May 1985, in which Contract 303 detailed the construction of viaducts from Eunos station to Kembangan station while Contract 304 detailed the construction of Kembangan station itself and Bedok station.[9][10] Contract 303 was awarded to a Japanese-Singaporean joint venture between Okumura Corporation and Oh Teck Thye for S$60 million (1985) (US$27.27 million) in December 1985.[11] As for Contract 304, it was awarded to a partnership between Obayashi Corporation and Resources Development Pte Ltd in January 1986 for S$70 million (1986) (US$32.15 million).[12] Work for Contract 304 began in March 1986.[13] To construct the station, Kampongs Kembangan and Pachitan were acquired.[14] The subcontract for the supply of post-tension cables and pre-cast beams for the viaducts was awarded to Swiss company VSL Systems in July 1986.[15] However, on 30 December 1986, the joint venture for Contract 303 was terminated.[16] It was later found out that Oh Teck Thye was placed under receivership when it failed to repay its debts, with Okumura taking over the project.[17][18] Kembangan MRT station opened on 4 November 1989 along with all other EWL stations from Bugis to Tanah Merah.[19][20]
On 22 March 1997 at 10:17 am, a man jumped in front of an oncoming west-bound train, where he sustained head, arm, and foot injuries. Although he was thought to have died instantly, the man was pronounced dead at 10:55 am. Train services between Eunos and Tanah Merah stations were disrupted for two hours.[21] Following a rise in track intrusions as well as commuters slipping when rushing for the train, the LTA and SMRT decided to install platform screen doors.[22] After several tests at different stations,[23] works for the half-height platform screen doors were expected to start in 2010,[24] with eventual installation and operations commencing at Kembangan station by August 2011.[25] The station was installed with high-volume low-speed fans by the first quarter of 2013.[26] In 2018, Kembangan was one of ten stations of the eastern portion of the East–West Line (EWL) that fully closed on 21 and 28 January as part of works for rail maintenance and checks for a new signalling system.[27][28]
Details[edit]
Kembangan station is on the EWL with the station code of EW6, situated between Bedok and Eunos station.[29] When it opened, it had the station code of E7[30] before being changed to its current station code in August 2001 as a part of a system-wide campaign to cater to the expanding MRT System.[31][32] Like many stations on the initial MRT network, Kembangan is an elevated station and has an island platform.[33][13] The station operates around 5:40 am to 12:30 am daily, with train frequencies varying from 2 to 5 minutes.[34][35] As part of the EWL, the station is operated by SMRT Trains.[36] It is also wheelchair-accessible and has bicycle facilities.[5][37] The station runs alongside Sims Avenue East and has two exits serving amenities in the area such as Kampong Kembangan Community Club (Kembangan CC), Masjid Kassim, and Bethesda Chapel.[38][5]
Similar to other EWL stations in the east, Kembangan station has a dome-shaped roof, with The Straits Times comparing it to a caterpillar in one article[39] and a rib cage in another article.[40] The design was an attempt by the MRT Corporation (MRTC) to give the stations on the EWL an "attractive look".[41] Additionally, as a part of SMRT's heritage-themed artwork showcase Comic Connect, the station features two murals created by students from St. Joseph's Institution.[42] The first mural depicts the Our Lady of Perpetual Succor (OLPS) Church and Kembangan CC while the second mural depicts the Masjid Kassim and the Buddhist Union.[43]
