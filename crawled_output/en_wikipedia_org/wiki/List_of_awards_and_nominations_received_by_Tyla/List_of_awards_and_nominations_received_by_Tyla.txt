^ Certain award groups do not simply award one winner. They acknowledge several different recipients, have runners-up, and have third place. Since this is a specific recognition and is different from losing an award, runner-up mentions are considered wins in this award tally. For simplification and to avoid errors, each award in this list has been presumed to have had a prior nomination.
The South African singer Tyla has won a total of 32 industry awards from 107 nominations throughout her career. Her self-titled debut studio album was released in 2024 and debuted at number 24 on the US Billboard 200 chart.[1] The album spawned her breakthrough single, "Water", which peaked at number seven on the US Billboard Hot 100.[2] That same year, she was named the youngest African soloist to win a Grammy Award at the 66th Annual Grammy Awards after winning the inaugural Best African Music Performance.[3]
Tyla started off doing cover versions of pop songs before she joined the amapiano wave.[4] She released her debut single, "Getting Late", in 2019; its music video was nominated for Best Music Video of the Year at the 28th Annual South African Music Awards in 2022.[5] In 2023, she released "Been Thinking", which was nominated for Best Produced Music Video at the 29th Annual South African Music Awards,[6] and she won the Best Female Artist award at the 9th Annual African Entertainment Awards USA later that year.[7] She was also nominated for Best New Artist at the Soul Train Music Awards,[8] and Best African Music Act at the MOBO Awards.[9]
In 2024, Tyla went on to win the most awards at the BET Awards, tying with the American singers Usher and Victoria Monét at the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles, California,[10] where she was named the Best New Artist[11] and Best International Act.[12] She received backlash after winning Best Afrobeats Video at the MTV Video Music Awards, where she identified as an amapiano artist in her acceptance speech.[13] In her native South Africa, she received the Song of the Year, International Achievement and Highest Airplay awards at the 3rd Annual Basadi in Music Awards; she was the most-nominated recipient with five, and the most-awarded performing artist at the event.[14] She also took home the Best International Act at the Cultural and Creative Industry Awards,[15] and the Most Stylish Performing Artist at the South African Style Awards.[16] She led the 18th Metro FM Music Awards nomination list with six, and she was honoured with the Global Icon award.[17] Tyla received a Global Force accolade at the inaugural Billboard R&B's No. 1s event.[18][19] Towards the end of 2024, at the 30th Annual South African Music Awards, Tyla won the most awards, receiving four from seven nominations.[20] GQ honoured her with the Entertainer of the Year award.[21] Tyla received the Impact Award in 2025, at the Billboard Women in Music Awards.[22] Tyla hosted the 2025 Kids' Choice Awards. She also won the Favorite Global Music Star award and she was nominated for Favorite Music Collaboration for her remix of "Show Me Love".[23][24]
