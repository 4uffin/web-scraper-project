United Arab Emirates portalvteThe Neolithic period in the United Arab Emirates is generally dated from 6,500 to 4,000 BCE and represents the transition from Paleolithic hunter-gatherer communities to settled and structured societies that subsisted on farming, fishing and animal husbandry.
The Neolithic people of the area were likely nomadic or semi-nomadic and were linked to regional trade networks, including with Ubaid era Mesopotamia. Late Neolithic trade links with other communities in the Arabian Peninsula resulted in the widespread dispersal of tool-making practises, as well as centralised production of tools, implements and jewellery. In the late Neolithic, the manufacture of soft-stone vessels and ceramics was added to the repertoire of the inhabitants of Southeastern Arabia.
The end of the Neolithic is marked by the 'Dark Millennium', the period from 4,000- 3,200 BCE when the coast and interior to the west of the Hajar Mountains was almost completely abandoned due to a period of intense aridity. The re-emergence of human population in the area is characterised by the early bronze age Hafit Period.
Paleolithic finds[edit]
The Paleolandscape at Jebel Faya, designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2025
The earliest finds of tools in the area have been from the Paleolandscape of Faya in Sharjah, where evidence of occupation dating back to 210,000 BCE was discovered, and also at Jebel Barakah in Abu Dhabi.[1] Four periods of Paleolithic hominid occupation at Faya have been identified by Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) dating, corresponding approximately to 210,000 BCE;
170,000 BCE and between 135,000 and 120,000 BCE.[1] These periods of occupation and absence have been linked to global and local climactic variations, with the Indian Monsoon being increasingly used to contextualise patterns of occupation in Paleolithic Southeastern Arabia.[1]
Finds of tools dated to 125,000 BCE at the Faya-1 site have been presented as evidence of a virile southern dispersal route of anatomically modern humans from Africa to populate the earth.[2] The tools found at Faya are distinctive and have links in their form and type to tools of a similar age found in Sudan, giving confidence in a virile southern trajectory rather than a leakage east of the people embarking on the Levantine path to Europe. This idea has been strengthened by work from other sites. From Faya they would have crossed to Iran and spread north and east. The archaeological evidence for this route of dispersal to the east is backed by studies of human DNA patterns.[2]
Knapped flint tools among extensive assemblages found at Jebel Barakah in Abu Dhabi also yield a date of 200,000 BCE.[3]
The Emirates is unusual in that there is scant evidence of Paleolithic occupation in the region throughout the Pleistocene glacial maximum (68,000 - 8,000 BCE), with some sixty settlements suddenly emerging around the coast of the Persian Gulf between 8,000 and 6,000 BCE during the later phase of the Flandrian Transgression, the late Holocene Climatic Optimum. This marked the end of the Pleistocene Ice Age when melting glaciers saw a rise in global seawater levels and the shallow valley of the Persian Gulf Oasis would have flooded, in a process that took place mainly between 18,000 and 8,000 BCE - although sea levels in the area didn't stabilise until approximately 5,000 BCE.[4]
Prior to this flooding event, the Persian Gulf would have been a wide valley with extensive lake systems, watered by the Ur Schatt, a river created by the northern confluence of the Tigris and Euphrates to flow down to the Strait of Hormuz, providing a rich and extensive setting for early hunter gatherer communities.[4]
Neolithic emergence[edit]
Neolithic burial from Buhais 18
The Neolithic in the Arabian Peninsula has been grouped into three periods, roughly analogous to the flint and stone tools the peoples of the time used. The early Neolithic from 7,000-6,500 BCE, the Mid-Neolithic from 6,500-4,500 BCE using trihedral, bifacial arrowheads and the late Neolithic from 4,500-3,200 with unipolar blades and more sophisticated manufacture of weapons, tools and jewellery.[5]
The Mid-Neolithic emergence of domestic architecture, testament to settlement and animal husbandry, is seen at Marawah Island and Gagha Island in Abu Dhabi. It is at the early Neolithic site at Gagha that buildings made of local limestone have been carbon dated to 6,500 BCE, with trihedral tools notably absent.[6]
Other Neolithic sites in the area also follow similar flint tool types, following what has been called the 'Arabian bifacial tradition', a commonaility in tool types found throughout the Arabian Peninsula.[7] Many Neolithic coastal sites are also associated with finds of Ubaid era (5,500-–3,700 BCE) decorated Mesopotamian pottery, testament to early trading links along the coast from the North.[8] Despite extensive finds of Ubaid pottery, there is no evidence of the emergence of a local ceramic industry until the late Neolithic.[7]
Neolithic sites of significance in the Emirates include those at Khatt, Akab Island, Tell Abraq, Mleiha, Madam, Qarn bint Saud, Al Ain, Dalma and the Wadi Haqil in Ras Al Khaimah.[7]
The inland necropolis at Jebel Buhais in Sharjah is the oldest in the Emirates[9] and features burials from 5,000 BCE onwards, with graves at the site thought to be those of nomadic herders who travelled inland for the winter season.[10]
Many of the burials at Buhais include grave goods such as flint tools, shell and coral jewellery as well as beads of chert, agate and limestone, all of which are found locally, as well as carnelian.[11]
The site of Akab Island provides unique insights into what are thought to have been early ritualistic practises, with a unique dugong bone mound discovered there, which not only has no direct parallel in the region but also stands as a rare (possibly unique) find dated to the 'Dark Millennium'.[12] The mound consists of structurally aligned dugong bones, representing over 80 dugongs, littered with jewellery and other artefacts and has been dated to between 3,500-3,200 BCE.[13] Although there is no direct parallel to the dugong mound, Neolithic burials with turtle remains have been noted in Oman at Ras Al Hamra (dated to 3,700-3,300 BCE). Structured dugong bone mounds have been found in totemic sites in Australia on the coast of the Torres Strait: these, however, date to between the 14th and 20th Centuries.[12]
The wider site at Akab shows occupation throughout the fifth millennium, from 4,750-3,814 BCE, while signs of occupation in the fourth millennium, apart from the bone mound, are scant.[12] Evidence of occupation patterns at Akab point to seasonality and also the possibility of fish processing (salting or smoking). Both net weights and bone hooks were found at the site, as well as evidence of settlement and bones from a wide range of coastal and deeper water species.[14]
Lifestyles[edit]
Although the Neolithic is generally associated with stable settlement and husbandry, the Neolithic in the United Arab Emirates appears to have been characterised by a mix of settled and nomadic and/or semi-nomadic lifestyles, a pattern which persists until the modern era.[8] Coastal occupation in the winter and pastoralism and horticulture in the interior would have been common throughout.[7] The domestication of sheep, cattle and goats is evidenced from 5,000 BCE onwards,[7] with evidence of extensive consumption of fish (including dugong and turtle) and the use of stone sinkers at Gagha pointing to the use of small nets as early as 6,500 BCE.[6]
The late Neolithic also was a time of regional trade and the emergence of tool production centres, as well as the making of soft stone objects out of chlorite and schist. More sophisticated tool use included novel explorations in methods of fishing, where open sea fishing for species such as tuna was first observed.[5]
The archaeological record shows that the late Neolithic Arabian Bifacial/Ubaid period came to an abrupt end in eastern Arabia and the Oman peninsula at the end of the fourth millennium BCE, just after a phase of lake lowering and onset of dune reactivation,[15] which saw the abandonment of the area to the west of the Hajar Mountains, from 4,000-3,200 BCE, a period in the history of the Emirates known as the 'Dark Millennium'.[8]
