The Strategic Mutual Defense Agreement (SMDA) is a security and defense agreement between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. Under this agreement, both countries committed to treating any act of aggression against one as an act against both. It was signed on 17 September 2025 at the Al Yamamah Palace in Riyadh during a state visit by Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.[1][2][3]
Background[edit]
See also: Pakistan–Saudi Arabia relations and Nuclear sharing § Potential nuclear sharing between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia
Pakistan and Saudi Arabia have long-standing military cooperation, defense training programs, economic, cultural and religious ties.[4][5]
In recent years, changes in Middle Eastern geopolitics (including concerns about external threats, reactions to Israeli military actions, and perceptions of American reliability as a guarantor of security) have heightened regional security concerns. Many analysts see the agreement in part as a response to such dynamics.[6][4][7]
The Financial Times reported that the Israeli airstrike in Qatar, another U.S. ally, a week earlier had deeply rattled Gulf states' feeling of security, adding to long-running concerns about U.S. unpredictability and commitment to their defense. A senior Saudi official stated, "We hope it will reinforce our deterrence — aggression against one is aggression against the other".[8]
Agreement[edit]
The treaty was signed on 17 September 2025 by the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in Riyadh. It came against the backdrop of Israeli strikes on Qatar and the following Arab-Islamic extraordinary summit in Doha.[9] Both countries have historically had close economic, religious, and security ties with each other. The timing of the pact appeared to be a warning after Israel's expanding military offensive across the Middle East.[10][11][12]
A senior Saudi official told Reuters, regarding whether Pakistan would provide Saudi Arabia with a nuclear umbrella, "This is a comprehensive defensive agreement that encompasses all military means."[6]
Reactions[edit]
Some neighboring states and regional powers have expressed concern about the impact on the regional security balance. India in particular has reacted with statements that it is carefully monitoring the development.[13][14] Pakistani newspaper Dawn called it as "the most significant upgrade to Pakistan–Saudi defense relations in decades".[15] Others note the ambiguity in the operational details of the agreement, particularly how the nuclear deterrence and mutual defense clause will be activated in practice.[4][6] Former diplomat Hussein Haqqani noted that the treaty likely covers the missile defense.[16]
