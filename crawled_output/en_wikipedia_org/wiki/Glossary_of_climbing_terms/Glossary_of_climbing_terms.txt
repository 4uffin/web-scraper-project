trail rope
Also haul line. A big wall climbing technique where the lead climber carries an additional static rope (in addition to their dynamic climbing rope) that hangs (or "trails") behind them as they ascend; the trail rope enables the belayer to pass equipment to the leader during the ascent, and for the leader to haul up equipment as the belayer ascends.[22][62]
traverse
Traversing
1.  A section of a route that requires progress in a horizontal direction.[1][2]
2.  A Tyrolean traverse is crossing a chasm using a fixed rope anchored at both ends.
3.  A pendulum traverse is swinging across a wall suspended from a rope anchored above the climber.[22]
4.  A tension traverse is a static version of a pendulum traverse where rope tension is used to control movement.[22]
tricam
Tricam
A simple camming protection device that has no moving parts (e.g. it is passive protection).
tuberAlso tubular
Tubers
A type of belay device.
tufa
Climbing on tufas
1.  A limestone rib formation that protrudes from the wall which climbers can pinch-grip.
2.  A plastic bolted-on bouldering hold to replicate such a formation on an climbing wall.
twin ropes
In lead climbing, using two ropes that are even thinner than double ropes, both of which need to be clipped in at each point of protection; sometimes used in long alpine climbing routes with major abseiling descents.[30]
twist lock
A climbing move where the hips "twist" perpendicular to the wall, the inside arm is "locked" on an upper hold, the outside arm holds the body against the wall, and the feet press down to propel the body higher.
U[edit]
UIAA
Acronym for the international governance body for mountaineering and other types of climbing; UIAA also regulates competition ice climbing.[1] See also IFSC.
UIAA grade
Also UIAA scale.
The UIAA grade system for rock climbing, which goes: ... VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, .... , to XII; is less common than the French grade system or the American YDS grade system, but still used in Germany and parts of Eastern Europe.[6]
UIAA Scale of Overall Difficulty
See Alpine-grade.[6]
undercling
Also undercut.
A downward hold which is gripped with the palm of the hand facing upwards.[1][2][11]
undercling pull
After a stein pull is completed, the undercling pull is a mixed climbing technique for continuing to use the hold to gain upward momentum by using the hold to pull into the rock; requires a lot more energy than a stein pull.[76]
undercut
See undercling.
V[edit]
V-grade
Also Hueco scale.
A grading system for bouldering problems invented by John Sherman, which goes: V0, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6, V7, ... , to V17.
The V-scale and the French font scale are the most common boulder grading systems in use worldwide.[1][6]
V-thread
Also Abalakov thread.
A type of abseiling point used especially in winter and in ice climbing.
verglas
A thin coating of ice that forms over rocks when rainfall or melting snow freezes, which is hard to climb on as there is insufficient depth for crampons to have penetration. See also clear ice and glaze ice.
via ferrata
Also Klettersteig.
Climbing a via ferrata
An alpine route where protection is from permanent steel fixed ropes or chains, with progression aided by artificial steel steps or ladders; commonly found in the Dolomites. See also lanyard and energy absorber.
volume hold
Volume holds
A large, hollow, bolted-on hold, for indoor climbing walls; it may itself contain individual holds
W[edit]
WI-grade
Also ice climbing grades.
Part of the ice climbing system for grading the technical difficulty of ice climbing routes, which goes: WI1, WI2, WI3, WI4, WI5, WI6, and up to WI13.[4] See also M-grade.
webbing
Round webbing
A hollow and flat nylon strip mainly used to make slings.
webolette
A piece of webbing with eyes sewn into the ends which can be used in place of a cordelette.
weighting
Any time a rope sustains the weight of the climber, e.g. "weighting the rope". This can happen during a minor fall, a whipper (long fall), or simply by resting while hanging on the belay rope. See also hangdogging.
whipper
Climber on a whipper
A large fall by a lead climber as they were well beyond the last piece of protection. See screamer.[79]
wire brushing
Cleaning a rock climbing route with a wire brush before an attempt; has ethical issues due to rock damage and possible chipping.[2]
wired
See dialled.[2]
wires
See nuts.[2]
X[edit]
X
A suffix used in the Yosemite decimal system for highlighting traditional climbing routes that have poor or even no possibilities for protection, where any fall could be fatal (e.g. Indian Face and Gaia). See R/X and chop route.
Y[edit]
yaniro
French term for a figure-four move which came from American climber Tony Yaniro's use of it on Chouca 8a+ (5.13c).[80]
yo-yo
A free climbing term pre-redpointing, where a falling lead climber returns to the ground to restart, but leaves their rope clipped into the protection — in redpointing, the rope is pulled free from all protection before re-starting the climb.[2]
Yosemite Decimal System
American system for grading walks, hikes, and climbs; the rock climbing (5.x) goes: 5.7, 5.8, 5.9, 5.10a, 5.10b, 5.10c, 5.10d, 5.11a, .... , 5.14a, 5.14b, 5.14c, 5.14d, 5.15a, etc.,
and with the French grade system, is the most widely used grading system worldwide for sport climbing.[6]
Z[edit]
z-clipping
While lead climbing, clipping into protection with a segment of rope from beneath the previous piece of protection, resulting in rope drag.[1][10]
z-pulley
Z-pulley system
A system of rope, anchors, and pulleys; is typically used to extricate a climber after falling into a crevasse.
zawn
A zawn in Wales
In Britain, a deep, narrow inlet in a sea cliff that is filled by the sea at high tide.[2]
zipper fall
Also gear rip-out.
A traditional climbing ground fall where all the protection gear fails in sequence (i.e. opens like a "zip").[2][81]
