This page provides a place to discuss new items for inclusion on In the news (ITN), a protected template on the Main Page (see past items in the ITN archives). Do not report errors in ITN items that are already on the Main Page here— discuss those at the relevant section of WP:ERRORS.
This candidates page is integrated with the daily pages of Portal:Current events. A light green header appears under each daily section – it includes transcluded Portal:Current events items for that day. You can discuss ITN candidates under the header.

Glossary[edit]
Blurbs are one-sentence summaries of the news story.
Altblurbs, labelled alt1, alt2, etc., are alternative suggestions to cover the same story.
A target article, bolded in text, is the focus of the story. Each blurb must have at least one such article, but you may also link non-target articles.
Articles in the Ongoing line describe events getting continuous coverage.
The Recent deaths (RD) line includes any living thing whose death was recently announced. Consensus may decide to create a blurb for a recent death.
All articles linked in the ITN template must pass our standards of review. They should be up-to-date, demonstrate relevance via good sourcing and have at least an acceptable quality.
Nomination steps[edit]
Make sure the item you want to nominate has an article that meets our minimum requirements and contains reliable coverage of a current event you want to create a blurb about. We will not post about events described in an article that fails our quality standards.
Find the correct section below for the date of the event (not the date nominated). Do not add sections for new dates manually – a bot does that for us each day at midnight (UTC).
Create a level 4 header with the article name (==== Your article here ====). Add (RD) or (Ongoing) if appropriate.
Then paste the {{ITN candidate}} template with its parameters and fill them in. The news source should be reliable, support your nomination and be in the article. Write your blurb in simple present tense. Below the template, briefly explain why we should post that event. After that, save your edit. Your nomination is ready!
You may add {{ITN note}} to the target article's talk page to let editors know about your nomination.
The better your article's quality, the better it covers the event and the wider its perceived significance (see WP:ITNSIGNIF for details), the better your chances of getting the blurb posted.
Purge this page to update the cache
Headers[edit]
When the article is ready, updated and there is consensus to post, you can mark the item as (Ready). Remove that wording if you feel the article fails any of these necessary criteria.
Admins should always separately verify whether these criteria are met before posting blurbs marked (Ready). For more guidance, check WP:ITN/A.
If satisfied, change the header to (Posted).
Where there is no consensus, or the article's quality remains poor, change the header to (Closed) or (Not posted).
Sometimes, editors ask to retract an already-posted nomination because of a fundamental error or because consensus changed. If you feel the community supports this, remove the item and mark the item as (Pulled).
Voicing an opinion on an item[edit]
Format your comment to contain "support" or "oppose", and include a rationale for your choice. In particular, address the notability of the event, the quality of the article, and whether it has been updated.
Please do...[edit]
ShortcutWP:ITNCDOWP:ITNCDO
Pick an older item to review near the bottom of this page, before the eligibility runs out and the item scrolls off the page and gets abandoned in the archive, unused and forgotten.
Review an item even if it has already been reviewed by another user. You may be the first to spot a problem, or the first to confirm that an identified problem was fixed. Piling on the list of "support!" votes will help administrators see what is ready to be posted on the Main Page.
Tell about problems in articles if you see them. Be bold and fix them yourself if you know how, or tell others if it's not possible.
Please do not...[edit]
ShortcutWP:ITNCDONTWP:ITNCDONT
Add simple "support!" or "oppose!" votes without including your reasons. Similarly, curt replies such as "who?", "meh", or "duh!" are not helpful. A vote without reasoning means little for us, please elaborate yourself.
Oppose an item just because the event is only relating to a single country, or failing to relate to one. We post a lot of such content, so these comments are generally unproductive.
Accuse other editors of supporting, opposing or nominating due to a personal bias (such as ethnocentrism). We at ITN do not handle conflicts of interest.
Comment on a story without first reading the relevant article(s).
Oppose a recurring item here because you disagree with the recurring items criteria. Discuss them here.
Use ITN as a forum for your own political or personal beliefs. Such comments are irrelevant to the outcome and are potentially disruptive.
Suggesting updates[edit]
There are two places where you can request corrections to posted items:
Anything that does not change the intent of the blurb (spelling, grammar, markup issues, updating death tolls etc.) should be discussed at WP:Errors.
Discuss major changes in the blurb's intent or very complex updates as part of the current ITNC nomination.

Article updatedNominator's comments: I've just closed the UN report about the Gaza genocide nomination. Some commentary was made that the genocide is important enough to post, despite the Gaza war being in "ongoing" already. It certainly gets updated frequently; the last 1000 edits have occurred since 29 July, which comes to 19 edits per day. As the blurb nomination didn't find support, we should discuss whether we add this to the ongoing item; I envisage that it should look like so: Gaza war (genocide) Schwede66 04:49, 20 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support, I don't find any reason against it. Alexcalamaro (talk) 04:54, 20 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support due to WP:PEIS being reduced. Achmad Rachmani (talk) 05:02, 20 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support as per above. --MtPenguinMonster (talk) 06:32, 20 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose This is a contentious topic and the issue of genocide is an especially contentious one.
The policy directs us to "err on the side of caution" but this would be an inflammatory addition and the previous discussion demonstrated a lack of consensus for posting it.
As the issue is amply covered within the existing Gaza war entry, there's no need for a second link. Andrew🐉(talk) 06:38, 20 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose per Andrew, and because it is covered in ongoing. No one doubts that Israel is also committing atrocities, but let us not forget that genocide is a crime, a legal concept that is declared by criminal courts (in this case, it will be the ICC that rules on it), not us. There is a risk of bias.
_-_Alsor (talk) 10:02, 20 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose: Already covered in ongoing. Plus, according to sources I can see, there is not yet any final ruling over whether or not there is a genocide going on. --- Elios Peredhel (talk), 10:34, 20 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose It should be very clear from the ongoing Gaze entry about what most consider to be a genocide going on there, in addition that we still cannot yet, as Wikipedia, call it a genocide factually as others have pointed out. Masem (t) 12:48, 20 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose The Gaza war is considered contentious (as can be seen by the redacted non EC comments above), and thus it's better for us to remain neutral and err on the side of caution. Trying to push this onto ITN time and time again feels (again) like an attempt to right great wrongs, which is not the purpose of either Wikipedia nor ITN. Cheers, atque supra! Fakescientist8000 16:26, 20 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose: Regardless of the discussion of it being or not a genocide and who gets to decide such a thing, it's an adjacent topic to the Gaza War, which is already ongoing. Cambalachero (talk) 17:34, 20 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support in principle. We can add it in parentheses next to the Gaza war. I don’t understand those who say that we—as Wikipedia—cannot call it a genocide when that word is already included in the article’s title. If you object the title for the sake of caution, you should advertise the problem on the article’s talk page, not argue against it here as this is not a place to discuss other stuff.--Kiril Simeonovski (talk) 19:13, 20 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Oppose blurb, neutral on RD - article does not show how he was transformative or influential in his field. Not sure on the reliability of Firstpost. EF5 12:41, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose blurb, support RD While i agree that he isn't much influental singer as many of UK or US ones, the posting as RD looks sufficient at least. It also confirmed at Times of India. 182.1.232.72 (talk) 12:49, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
since the article is being heavily edited rn, im pretty sure that eventually new sources will form talking about his journey and influence BengalMC (talk) 12:51, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Comment Edited the nomination to be in line with the rest. 5.57.242.223 (talk) 13:20, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Not ready, filmography largely unreferenced. Spotted several uncited statements which I've marked. Once fixed, I support RD only. 5.57.242.223 (talk) 13:37, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Comment If this is to be blurbed, there needs to be a significant amount of reasons why he was considered a major figure (accidental death from scuba diving, I don't makes "death as the story" here). The sources that I am seeing about his death, even though there are tributes made, aren't the same type of level I'd expect for a major entertainment figure, but I could be wrong. Masem (t) 13:44, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Zubeen Garg was like a big figure in Both Bengal and Assam, an entire generation (Including me) grew up listening to his song on Television. From what I know, he was such a big deal in Assam that an entire bridge, and statue was made in his name BengalMC (talk) 13:52, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I do see that in the sources, but we don't the idea of a major figure simply on fame or popularity. We're not looking necessarily at internataion or national significance but I feel from what I read in these obit sources that he's recognized across India but that's mainly a popularity thing, he didn't, for example, transform the Indian music industry or similar scale of significance. Masem (t) 13:56, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose blurb, Oppose RD on quality. Not really seeing any evidence of being transformative in his field or having a worldwide impact. The article currently has tagged sections and CN tags so is not ready at the moment for RD.

This person knew some 40 languages, which in India is a remarkable feat in itself, and was famous in India, the world's most-populated country as well as the most-populated country where English (the language of this encyclopedia) is a lingua franca.

Oppose Such pacts are extremely common, and doesn't significantly change the politics in the area. Masem (t) 03:56, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I'm not convinced this should be posted, but I'll play devil's advocate:International agreements of various sorts frequently get signed, including partnership agreements, but just how common are actual mutual defense pacts of this sort? The article Defense pact only lists five after 1992, with this being one of them. It's possible that the list is incomplete, but that doesn't seem "extremely common". 98.170.164.88 (talk) 04:34, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Comment This is similar to the Australia/PNG pact in that it extends and formalises existing close relations.
And it's being made public to deter potential aggressors.
The specific trigger seems to be the recent Israeli strike on Doha which the US did nothing about.
The target article doesn't comment on the weakening of US credibility as a security guarantor in the region – a point which appears in the sources.
Such implications and ramifications take time to work out in practice so, like the Australia/PNG case, I'm not sure we should headline this as a big announcement. Andrew🐉(talk) 06:27, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

(talk • contribs) 13:21, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
That's a good point User:Bzweebl. The more I think about it, it's hard for me to think of a similar agreement outside of NATO in the 1940s and the Warsaw Pact in the 1950s. Any further thoughts User:Masem? This easily theoretically puts Pakistani nuclear missiles in the range of parts of NATO - not to mention the entire Middle East, not just the eastern Persian Gulf. Nfitz (talk) 21:52, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
For one, the article has none of the specifics of the agreement in it, so it is impossible to tell what the significance is. Also, generally such agreements need ratification by the legislative bodies of the signing nations before it can be realized. Masem (t) 23:46, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose - shouldn't it be the summit that's in the ITN? Not the treaty signed by two attending powers? There's always treaties of some kind being signed at such events. I don't even see this mentioned in the article on the summit. Nfitz (talk) 14:15, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Which summit? The 2025 Arab–Islamic extraordinary summit?
Or the state visit of the Pakistani PM to Saudi Arabia? Andrew🐉(talk) 16:23, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The extraordinary one. It's the same tour by the PM, and they were both in Doha for the summit, a stones throw from Saudi. Nfitz (talk) 21:43, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Strong support. Given that a recent war just happened with one of these two countries, the current and potential significance of this alliance is rather high. 23.128.224.65 (talk) 17:39, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

This new development, I just saw in the news. This is a huge escalation of things it seems in US politics after the assassination of Charlie Kirk.

Support The mass arrest of state officials is unusual and notable. --MtPenguinMonster (talk) 03:26, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose This is not the first time that state officials have been arrested in trying to check up on detained immigrants held in ICE centers (last time they were only held for a few hours or overnight, so it was just for show). Its also far from the biggest news related to US politics right now, that being the attack on the First Amendment via the cancellation of Jimmy Kimmel's show (which I'm not suggesting should be posted because its US politics and of NTRUMP). Masem (t) 03:55, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I was surprised that no one nominated the cancellation of Jimmy Kimmel's show. Hawkeye7 (discuss) 04:28, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
We should say "suspension," not "cancellation," at least as far as we know so far, for accuracy's sake, right? Ryan Reeder (talk) 04:48, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Its a news story but not really yet at the stage of being an encyclopedic article because what's happened after rests on a whole bunch of hypotheticals, opinions, and informed analysis. Many possible ends of this story would just be fizzling out of the news, while some I can see as potentially being far more encyclopedic and ITN worthy. That's the difficulty with most stories that involve politics, there's no clear endpoint to say if it is really significant from the long-term, encyclopedic view compared with the short-term, daily coverage and endless talking heads of the media. Masem (t) 05:05, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
STRONGEST OPPOSE per Masem. 64.114 etc 15:03, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose The New York Times article makes clear this isn't a "mass arrest" so much as a political stunt. Brad Lander, one of those arrested, used this same tactic in June with the same result. The blurb is inaccurate, and arrests of trespassers in federal buildings is not notable. Dr Fell (talk) 04:05, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Ongoing The nomination says that this is an ongoing story and they are right.
So, this should be an ongoing nomination. Andrew🐉(talk) 06:30, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

_-_Alsor (talk) 10:02, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose The page reads too much like original research - as if it's trying to make a point. Still, I don't see it being particularly noteworthy - this kind of abuse isn't unusual in flawed democracies like that one. If we had an ongoing for every individual country where stuff happens, we'd have 100+ ongoings. I'm surprised the article hasn't gone to AfD to tell the truth. Nfitz (talk) 14:10, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
That article demonstrates a lot of the NOTNEWS problem on WP (editors trying to document every tiny event in some fashion than the big picture), as well as a RGW-type problem (along the lines of "we have to document these improper arrests made by this admin to show how bad it is"). Masem (t) 14:22, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose big news, but domestic news. It doesn't have that much of a big impact. Chorchapu (talk | edits) 16:15, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

In the US I don't see this getting "all the news"-type coverage; Jimmy Kimmel getting (wrongfully) yanked by the FCC is getting way more coverage. EF5 14:21, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
On AP, it's the second big article (Live updates: Trump and Starmer sign tech deal worth billions of dollars), on the Guardian US the visit is also the second (Live: Trump suggests Starmer use military to stop illegal immigration and repeats wind power attacks), on CNN it's the first item on the left (During press conference with Starmer, Trump says Putin ‘let me down’), on NBC it's on top (Trump's UK visit gets political after royal pageantry), and on NPR it's in the second row (Starmer says he and Trump talked about support for Ukraine, pressure on Russia). While on many of these the Kimmel story is higher or bigger it's a big international deal in a big, highly-reported-on state visit that lots of people and news sites are talking about. Chorchapu (talk | edits) 15:10, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose no clear indication that this is really "historic", and instead seems more along the same negotiations on tariffs and investments from this admin. Masem (t) 14:40, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Oppose. Is there anything about this deal that makes it particularly notable? It seems to just be one of many that occur globally all the time. Even the linked article isn’t specifically about it and it’s already overly detailed imo. La Ovo (talk) 14:44, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose no evidence that it's actually historic, not even mentioned at target article, and even if it was, it'd likely be a minimal paragraph of content. Doesn't meet WP:ITNSIGNIF. Joseph2302 (talk) 15:05, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Oppose as ongoing, as this would already be covered by the Gaza ongoing. If this was meant to cover the drone strike (given the sources listed), that was last week (Sept 9) and that would make this very stale as a news item. Masem (t) 03:22, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose as covered by ongoing. The Kip (contribs) 04:47, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Oppose per above. Suggest that it's unlikely to be blurbworthy whatever the case, given that it's covered by ongoing, and we may soon have another Gaza blurb This post was made by orbitalbuzzsaw gang (talk) 08:06, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose - definitely covered by ongoing, and if it were not, I would not consider this activity in itself to be anything like significant enough to merit a slot in Ongoing for itself. GenevieveDEon (talk) 08:58, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I feel like this kind of article would've been a better "ongoing" target than our indefinite war articles. I like how it's specific and I would love to be able to feature the work that is being put into this article. I think it would be a lot more helpful to readers to feature articles like these than to feature the largest-scale article possible. Sadly, currently, we don't really have a space for this kind of ongoing subject. ~Maplestrip/Mable (chat) 10:14, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Its not even a good ongoing, which is meant for stories with near daily news coverage and updates. This flotilla pops up in the news every now and then but definitely nowhere close to that daily coverage we expect. Masem (t) 12:00, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose per above. Mayyybe we could blurb it if something major happens with the current one but definitely not an ongoing and we'd do the article about the specific flottilla.. Chorchapu (talk | edits) 13:12, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Since that covers the substantive update it could probably do with fleshing out a little.
Not supporting a blurb but not violently against one either, over the course of his career yes he really is one of the greats, but his heyday was several decades ago and I'm not sure that he reaches the requisite threshold of current popular notability, i.e. are enough readers going to actively click through to justify a blurb? 3142 (talk) 12:43, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
We don't make a distinction if a person's significance was well in the past or more recent, only that it is well demonstrated. Masem (t) 13:10, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
You may not; I do.
Notability for this purpose is a different threshold to general articles.
ITN is supposed to be a service to the readership, to enable readers to easily find articles of interest.
It is not our role to tell the reader what they should be interested in, and if no-one is the coverage is entirely pointless.
Rather it is better directed to something people are interested in. 3142 (talk) 16:35, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
"he reaches the requisite threshold of current popular notability, i.e. are enough readers going to actively click through to justify a blurb?" this is not a requirement for blurb, because we have blurbed people who are not that well-known, but yes, enough readers will actively click.

Oppose at present: too much unsourced material for MP inclusion. Would support RD only once the article is up to spec.

Support blurb. Has two Academy Awards, created Sundance. "In his ’70s heyday, few actors possessed Redford’s star wattag", "as a movie star in his prime, few could touch him". "A godfather for independent film". [2]. Has starred in three films that won Academy Award for Best Picture. That is a shoe-in for blurb.
BilboBeggins (talk) 14:05, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Simply having won or starred in award winning films is not sufficient, but it is noted that he was considered one of the great actors in part because he won those awards, in addition to the other stuff he did to promote indie films and establishing Sundance.

I know that being Oscar winner only does not automatically qualify for blurb. But winning competitive Oscar and getting Honrary Award is rare, and he won almost every major award.

Oppose blurb Redford was obviously a big star in his 1970s heyday but I wouldn't say he's the very most recognised and transformative US film actor of his generation. Now, one could say he doesn't need to be - he was huge, much-awarded, features in some highly-acclaimed films - but I think we as users ought to be thinking about the long game with figures like this. I don't wish to sound morbid but there are a *lot* of very notable living North American film actors in their seventies, eighties and nineties that we are likely to discuss blurbing here in the next ten years or so, most of whom made their mark at a similar time to Redford. Dick Van Dyke, Mel Brooks, Clint Eastwood, William Shatner, Robert Duvall, Alan Alda, Shirley MacLaine, Woody Allen, Warren Beatty, Jack Nicholson, Morgan Freeman, Dustin Hoffman, Jane Fonda, Elliott Gould, Jon Voight, Harvey Keitel, F. Murray Abraham, Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Faye Dunaway, Sylvester Stallone, Barbra Streisand, Harrison Ford, Goldie Hawn, Christopher Walken, Michael Douglas, Steve Martin, Tommy Lee Jones, Susan Sarandon, Diane Keaton, Arnold Schwarzenegger (he is Austrian and American), Richard Dreyfuss, Samuel L. Jackson, Meryl Streep, Sigourney Weaver, Richard Gere and John Travolta are just a few names that spring to mind. There's also various Hollywood directors (Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese, George Lucas, Steven Spielberg, James Cameron), composers (John Williams) and non-American actors nevertheless associated with US film (Rita Moreno, Julie Andrews, Michael Caine and many more). All of these people are elderly, most of them are octogenarians or older, and I think it's fair to say that quite a few of them are dead certs for blurbs. Will all of their deaths be blurbed? Perhaps not but I think it's fair to say that most of them would be proposed and that a great many of them would get through ITN with the system and attitudes we have currently. There is going to be a real deluge of these figures, for many reasons (if I was to offer a pithy summary, Hollywood boomed in the 1960s and 70s and its hits were kept alive by television and home media, becoming part of a collective experience that is less achievable today) and with that in mind, I think we perhaps need to be somewhat brutal with who gets in and who doesn't.Humbledaisy (talk) 18:19, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Elliout Gould, F. Murray Abraham, Goldie Hawn, Steve Martin are nowhere near. Dick Van Dyke never won an Oscar, so did Harvey Keitel.
And I don't see any sense of discussing the blurbs for persons who are alive. Some of persons you mentioned will be blurbed, so I don't know how them possibly being on the same scale is argument for not blurbing Redford. BilboBeggins (talk) 18:43, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
If you're not interested in discussing the blurbs for alive people, why did you tell me which ones you think are nowhere near? As I said, "I think it's fair to say that most of them would be proposed and that a great many of them would get through ITN with the system and attitudes we have currently". I didn't say I think they'll all be blurbed. I just wanted to demonstrate the sheer amount of notable, award-winning US film actors of a certain vintage and the problem it may pose to ITN.Humbledaisy (talk) 19:26, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
"If you're not interested in discussing the blurbs for alive people, why did you tell me which ones you think are nowhere near?"
I am simply saying you can't compare with Redford people you can't compare with him.
Blurb discussions taking place won't hurt anyone, if we don't want them to happen, then we should make some definite rules for blurbing. BilboBeggins (talk) 19:48, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Let's say that's 50 ppl in that list, all with a likely chance to die from old age over the next ten years. That's five whole blurbs a year, which in no way weighs down ITN, but that also assumes quality is there and that it's clear of their legacy to the industry. That last part, I don't know how true that is for all on the list., as just being a star from that period is not a indicator of being a major figure. Redfprd's significance has been demonstrated but I'm not sure if that can be said for all of them listed. Masem (t) 19:15, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I'd suggest that five US film actors a year would be quite a significant weight on ITN. Combine it with UK film actors of the same vintage and it's going to be a great amount of one kind of notable person. That's all I'm trying to say. As I say, the names were off the top of my head and to make a point - I'm by no means suggesting they'll all be nominated or all be blurbed.Humbledaisy (talk) 19:26, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
John Travolta, aged 71, is likely to die withing the next 10 years? I haven't checked any other ages. Perhaps 30 to 40% of that dies in the next 10 years. So even less blurbs! Nfitz (talk) 23:29, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I guess I'll repeat myself again. I said that those names are likely to come up "in the next ten years or so". Travolta is also the youngest person of the many I named by almost five years. I don't want to grumble but I go to great pains to make myself clear on ITN, to anticipate and address any potential misunderstandings or unanswered questions (hence the length of my comment) and I still have to repeat myself.Humbledaisy (talk) 15:59, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
A lot of actors at RD and blurb discussions fail on sourcing, so that alone will likely cut down that list. I also doubt all of the actors you mention could get consensus to be blurbed even if the quality is sufficient. I see a few names on there that would be shoe-ins, a few that I highly doubt would make it, and a lot that could go either way. We're not going to have that much of a problem here. QuicoleJR (talk) 20:29, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I think there ought to be a discussion about establishing standards for blurb-worthy individuals.
My sensibilities may be more inclusive than some; I would include pretty much all of the names on that list, as they are household names and recognizable to a general audience of the English-speaking world, as well as many outside of that audience.
But where do we draw the line?
What system of measurements should we use?
Where would I draw the line, at least in terms of those in the entertainment industry?
Among some of the oldest in that field, I would probably put it somewhere around June Lockhart, William Daniels, Rosemary Harris, Marion Ross, Vera Miles, Joanne Woodward, John Astin, and Barbara Eden (all of whom are over 94).
Some of their roles are well-remembered, some quite fondly, but generally they are either known for primarily one role, or their work is much more familiar to the general public than their names, or in the case of Joanne Woodward, is still a bit overshadowed by someone else (her husband, Paul Newman), and derives at least some of her familiarity on the strength of that connection.
The names that Humbledaisy included are all known by their own names first, not for any single role, and therefore, it would be the death of the individual that would be blurb-worthy.
However, I'm not sure that the Robert Redford discussion is the place for this conversation (which, by the way, I would Support Blurb; as, if you don't include him, who would you include?) but I'm not sure what the proper place to have it would be.
Wikipedia editors have different sensibilities.
To some, it seems that "old man dies" is never news, but I can't tell you how many notable deaths I've learned about by coming to this page (and I started coming to the proposals page (and even occasionally contributing to it) instead of the main page because a lot of people get left off of the main page).
The purpose of an encyclopedia and of Wikipedia is to allow people to be informed, and including recent deaths and blurbing notable ones fulfills this purpose by allowing people to be informed.
I think we could also discuss other criteria for notability.
Is it necessary to blurb the recurring champions of every sport, including a regional dart-throwing championship, for example?
A change in head of state is significant, in principle, but is it necessary to include a change in the prime minister of Tuvalu, with a population of less than 10,000?
We have Recent Deaths for those not deemed sufficiently blurb-worthy, but not anything similar for other news items.
Again, I know it's not really the place for this discussion (but thank you for reading my thoughts if you have), but I think it would be advantageous to have it.
Perhaps someone could suggest the best place for it.Ryan Reeder (talk) 01:00, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Support RD; oppose blurb – Per Humbledaisy. Arguments based on his accolades are not entirely convincing as it's somewhat expected that a high-profile actor will receive a medal or two at some point; what matters is Redford being "transformative" within his field. Not exactly a household name in the 2020s either. Nice4What (talk · contribs) – (Thanks ♥) 21:21, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Nice4What: Redford was transformative in the film industry as the founder of the Sundance Institute, whose Sundance Film Festival played a key role in the rise of indie films. QuicoleJR (talk) 21:35, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
He is one of three founders of that festival (the most high profile name of the three), so I don't think we can really call him transformative by association. The reason we are considering him for a blurb is surely about acting and I don't think we've established that he was a transformative actor. Humbledaisy (talk) 22:14, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support blurb Iconic actor worldwide. Seeing the list above convinces me that we should blurb him. It is OK to have a healthy number of blurbed deaths to balance all the sports news and the accidents news.

Is it your intention to contribute to death-blurb discussion in a meaningful way, or merely to disrupt them? OLDMANDIES and 'underwater basket weaver' tell us about as much about the merits of the case as 'bus plunge' does about an arbitrarily selected public transport accident. There is still no requirement either for the manner of death to be notable, nor for the death to be treated as a discrete event in itself. Only your last point is even relevant in principle, but unfortunately it's wrong - Redford's death made front page news here in the UK, for example.

The problem is that this is a frequent statement by this editor, and completely ignores the written guidance we have for RD Blurb selection. One can complain that Redford wasn't a major figure and their death was not the news story, and there may be disagreement about that but that's a legit argument. But to claim the only reason to post an RD blurb is that the death must be notable, ignoring that the other options exist, is disruptive. It also doesn't help with the weak insult of a person still covered by BLP. If the editor wants to remove that "major figure" or "life as the story" aspects we have for RD Blurbs, the way to push that is on the ITN talk page, but while it exists, their arguments should reflect what the guidelines say.

GenevieveDEon (talk) 09:04, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Posted blurb. You guys know me, I'm very often opposed to routine deaths of household names without demonstration of further notability... but looking at this with my admin hat on rather than as a contributor, I see a very clear consensus to blurb this one, with arguments of those arguing he was one of the top figures of the film industry in his time. I've also noted the "needs work" comments above, but I think there's also a broad consensus that this meets the minimum threshold for inclusion within ITN, as also hinted at in Masem's assessment above. Sure, it's not GA or FA level, and some prose on "his handsome appearance and charm which made him a sex symbol" (perhaps not in that language though?!) as well as his skiing hobbies would be good additions, but aren't fundamental to having a vaguely complete article.  — Amakuru (talk) 14:46, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

There are literally no arguments based on Wikipedia rules in the whole discussion.

Oppose blurb, So many other stories get shut down even when they have massive news coverage, other past blurbs like the Charlie Kirk killing still have more coverage then Redford's death.

Exactly, someone dying at a normal stage of life whose peak influence was decades ago does not warrent encyclopedic coverage. It feels like news stories tick by ITN too fast due to blurbs like this.

This is simply what I have gathered and experienced, again seemingly enough people thought he was deserving of a blurb so who am I to stand in the way.

Weak oppose as this is significant but covered by ongoing. --MtPenguinMonster (talk) 11:31, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
We posted the Gaza famine. ArionStar (talk) 11:46, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Yeah, that's also because it's a top UN-affiliated body declaring as such. This is also similar.--ZKang123 (talk · contribs) 11:52, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support alt1 The war is covered in ongoing, the genocide should also be mentioned. Scuba 21:48, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose. Report does not seem significant compared to with what happens currently, there can hardly be any consequences because of it. BilboBeggins (talk) 22:39, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support It's an ongoing event which details the current war and humanitarian issues in Gaza. Rager7 (talk) 15:50, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support alt1 as clear, concise and representative of most sources. This is clearly notable at the moment, and is worth mentioning on its own, despite the ongoing. (Otherwise, "war" is doing a lot of heavy lifting in "Gaza war".) Lewisguile (talk) 18:01, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support, Although a contentious topic, the UN report claims Israel committed genocide in Gaza.
Killing,
Causing serious bodily or mental harm
Deliberately inflicting conditions of life,
Calculated to bring about the destruction of the Palestinians, and
Imposing measures intended to prevent births. --QalasQalas (talk) 11:34, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Very weak oppose if only because I personally believe the ICJ case to be the metaphorical “big one” that we should post, but I’m willing to strike my vote if the community disagrees. If that happens, I prefer ALT1 - ALT2 has some superfluous bits and the original blurb is awkwardly-worded. The Kip (contribs) 13:16, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose - so what? It's not like the UN will do anything about it. EF5 13:16, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Don't think that's sufficient grounds for oppose. Also, the UN has also been heavily critical of Israel, mind, with a resolution recently passed advocating for a two-state solution and criticising Israel's military actions.--ZKang123 (talk · contribs) 10:43, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support alt1 (though switch to present tense). Whether the war in Gaza constitutes a genocide has been controversial and different bodies have made different assessments. This is the closest we're ever going to get to an 'official' determination. Genocide is enormously important and recognition of one certainly merits posting as an ITN blurb, in addition to the war itself being in the ongoing section. The article is an example of our best work, very well referenced and has been carefully updated. Modest Genius talk 13:37, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Modest Genius What about the ICJ case (albeit it’ll likely be a while before the ruling is even formulated, let alone released)? The Kip (contribs) 13:41, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I am not an expert on international law, but as I understand it the ICJ is responsible for determining whether a specific person is guilty of the crime of genocide, not the broader issue of whether a genocide occurred at all. The ICJ will likely take years or decades to bring anyone to trial (if it ever happens). For example, it was clear in the late 90s that there had been a genocide in Bosnia, but it took until 2016 for the ICJ to convict Karadžić of the crime, and the ICJ's own determination was of a much narrower legal sense that excluded many aspects of the conflict. So while an ICJ conviction would be big news in itself, I don't think it's the determining factor of whether genocide occurred. As an analogy: if someone is murdered, we don't wait years for a court conviction of the specific murderer before reporting that the death was a murder. Modest Genius talk 14:10, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Modest Genius I believe what you’re defining is the ICC, not the ICJ - the ICC prosecutes individuals, the ICJ nation-states. The Kip (contribs) 14:28, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
You're right, I mixed up the courts. For Bosnia, the relevant ICJ case was in 2007 - still more than a decade after the events. So I don't think that difference fundamentally changes the reasoning. Modest Genius talk 14:50, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Question of how binding this is or what actions this triggers. With the UN declaration of famine, that seemed to establish the need for more humanitarian programs to Gaza. This is a report by a three person panel and doesn't seem to have any immediate impact or even confirmation by the UN as a whole, so it seems less significant at this point. Masem (t) 14:25, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Seriously, this trends Google News topics. QalasQalas (talk) 18:02, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Strongly oppose.
The Gaza genocide article has significant verifiability issues. -- mikeblas (talk) 14:25, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Mikeblas: This was a false-positive error and due to usage of {{invoke}} for short inline references.
See the response in your topic: Talk:Gaza_genocide#missing_citations
Unless you have other concerns, can you please strike down your assertion? Bogazicili (talk) 19:01, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Verifiability concerns remain. Dozens of footnotes show warnings for footnotes that don't have matching citations. There's no realistic way to tell which of those are false alarms and which are not, other than manually visiting each. Indeed, the use of {{invoke}} seems to cause false alarms in the code that indicates a footnote has no target. The use of {{invoke}} is required because the Wiki markup parser has a limitation in the amount of text it can handle (or generate?). The article has gone through a wave of changing how it annotates its references and then uses this {{invoke}} trick, ignoring the problems it causes for verifiability.
That the workaround is necessary is a bug: an undesired limitation in functionality. The house of cards that implements -- templates, invoke, LUA scripts, code in the parser, ... -- is Byzantine and falls over easily when stressed. This is just one such article with problems.
Verifiability is one of the fundamental tenets of the encyclopedia, but the Wiki itself makes it extremely difficult to implement. The main page (and its sub features like "In the News") should not be used to showcase articles that are struggling with the parser implementation. Particularly for pages that cover sensitive and controversial subjects and must rely on easy verifiability to maintain balance and objectivity.
And so I reiterate my Strongly oppose not-vote. -- mikeblas (talk) 21:16, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Mikeblas: I am not sure if you checked the page again after recent edits. Your comment may be outdated.
Are you still talking about no-target errors? I am not seeing any at the moment. Pretty much all of the {{invoke}}'s were removed. Bogazicili (talk) 22:09, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Mikeblas: some of the {{invoke}}s were re-added to reduce WP:PEIS
However, I am still not seeing any Category:Harv_and_Sfn_template_errors or any no-target errors. Another editor has confirmed these issues have been resolved [3]
I am taking your WP:V claims very seriously, so I request:
If there are any issues, clearly state what they are
If there are no longer any issues, strike down your assertions. Bogazicili (talk) 16:31, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Sounds like you're also quite serious about telling everyone that you're waiting for me, as you done here and a couple times on the article talk page.
I'm sorry that I'm not replying as fast as you'd like. I don't have the time to revise my not-vote every time you request me to do so, and as immediately as you're asking me to. Remember: it's not me that's the problem here: the issue is that the article exposes significant limitations in the referencing system and the wiki parser.
If you think the article is in better shape (and better yet: if there is consensus that the solution now is what to use going forward) then you should feel free to move forward. And you can do that without me revising my not-vote. Maybe focus on the other dozen or so oppose votes here.
I've been working through the other sourcing and verifiability issues as I have time, and you can see my comments on Talk:Gaza genocide as well as in the history of the article. -- mikeblas (talk) 18:19, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support, It is notable that an organization affiliated with the United Nations characterizes this as genocide. Greensminded24 (talk)
— Preceding undated comment added 14:47, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Weak oppose - The UN Commission of Inquiry does not represent the UN. This report is arguably less important than similar statements from IAGS, MSF, Amnesty, B'Tselem, etc, which represent entire organizations.
EvansHallBear (talk) 16:25, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose, in part because of the contentious topic implications as well as the significant unaddressed question of why this report and not others meets the threshold for WP:ITNSIGNIF. Coining (talk) 17:23, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose: From the linked Reuters article (bolding by me): "The commission's 72-page legal analysis is the strongest U.N. finding to date but the body is independent and does not officially speak for the United Nations. The U.N. has not yet used the term 'genocide' but is under increasing pressure to do so." Cambalachero (talk) 17:33, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The altblurbs specify that it is an independent commission, not the UN as a whole.
–DMartin 22:03, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I Support the Alt1 blurb as concise and accurate. This has been all over the world's main news outlets and is the news lede [4] for the BBC's "flagship international news and current affairs radio programme" Newshour (for example). The other similar determinations made for instance by B'Tselem, Amnesty International, and the Médecins Sans Frontières only give further weight to the UN Commission's determination; this assessment is reflected in the editorial decisions of global newspapers to highlight their findings on their front pages. Our decision should disregard clearly false arguments that the report fails WP:ITNSIGNIF (belied by international reporting) or that the article has WP:V arguments, already resolved on the talk page. -Darouet (talk) 18:10, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
You seem to fail to get what WP:ITNSIGNIF is about. International reporting is Necessary But Not Sufficient, a story also needs consensus. Many people have pointed that, although the blurb may suggest otherwise to the unaware reader, this body is not the UN nor what it says is an official UN view on the topic.
If you want to change that, you should explain if we got it wrong somehow and this Commission is really the big deal you seem to think it is. Cambalachero (talk) 18:47, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I'm glad you brought this up. The language of Alt1 is identical to that of the most reputable news organizations. The BBC states, "a UN investigation has concluded that Israel has committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza."[5] Compare that to Alt1: "A UN Commission of Inquiry has concluded Israel has committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza." I agree with you that an editor could be, personally, confused about what that means. But the UN investigation's findings are consistent with determinations of most international and Israeli human rights organizations, which are remarkably unified in their consensus. -Darouet (talk) 19:01, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support. Prefer alt1. The report was titled: "Legal analysis of the conduct of Israel in Gaza pursuant to the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide" [6] The inquiry was headed by Navi Pillay [7], president of International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda relevant to Rwandan genocide. I don't know what does not officially speak for the United Nations means. UN is composed of different countries. Some UN bodies or officials may refrain until an official ICJ ruling in several years. But I don't think that's a reason to omit this from the news. Alt1 says A UN Commission of Inquiry, it doesn't say "The UN". So I am not sure where the confusion is in. Bogazicili (talk) 19:35, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Comment: I have just tagged the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory article for lack of NPOV, and explained it at the talk page. In short, it only mentions what the reports say and never the criticisms of such reports, even when those criticisms are already in the news pieces being cited. Cambalachero (talk) 19:36, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support significant declaration by the UN, article looks to be in good shape. RachelTensions (talk) 20:13, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose This is covered by the ongoing item. Andrew🐉(talk) 21:08, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I would argue that as this is something primarily regard civilians that it's different(or at least different enough) that the military actions covered by ongoing.
–DMartin 22:06, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The article in Ongoing is Gaza war.
This uses the word genocide 62 times, it has a substantial paragraph about it in the lead and extensive coverage in the body including details of this particular report.
So, it's already much better covered by Ongoing than other issues such as protests. Andrew🐉(talk) 22:43, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support Significant event, comparable to the statements of the International Commission of Inquiry on Darfur. All linked articles are of good quality.
–DMartin 22:06, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Comment Is there a good illustrative image for this entry?
Maybe something like c:File:An UNRWA school which turned into a shelter in Deir el-Balah, Gaza Strip.jpg.
–DMartin 22:19, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
It is distressing but I think something like this [8], which appears in Al-Farabi School Bombing, would be illustrative, but sad. -Darouet (talk) 00:45, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support, clearly significant development that exceeds the ongoing Morgan695 (talk) 23:23, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I lean towards oppose for now. This is an independent investigation body from the UN. Unlike the famine blurb, with the IPC more directly affiliated with the UN, this is still a separate commission and the UN had not officially declared the conflict as a "genocide" as such. When the UN accept the findings, then it would be more significant.--ZKang123 (talk · contribs) 10:41, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose Independent commission that notably does not speak for the UN, nor does it claim to, makes claim regarding a war that several others agencies have already made. This feels more like an attempt to right a great wrong or be a WikiActivist. Not notable enough on its own; falls under ongoing regardless. Cheers, atque supra! Fakescientist8000 14:10, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose on quality. While I disagree with the article's orange tag (since the given sources claimed to be selectively used give relatively little prominence to the Israeli criticism and more would be WP:UNDUE), the article still mostly just presents the commission's reports (and briefly discusses criticism by Israel and the US), without much about the context, how the commission operates, its relationship with the UN, etc. Chaotic Enby (talk · contribs) 14:25, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I presume you are referring to the article on the commission? The altblurbs only bold link Gaza genocide, which seems in excellent shape. If you don't like the other bold link, would you support alt1? Modest Genius talk 15:20, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
My bad, didn't catch that the altblurbs changed the bolded links. In that case, weak support the altblurbs, as, despite being covered by ongoing, the results of the fact-finding mission still rise above the higher significance threshold. Chaotic Enby (talk · contribs) 17:22, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
While civilian casualties are common in war, it is abundantly clear that is not what is happening here. I'm honestly not sure about this nomination specifically, but continuing to sweep up all of what is happening into the heading of "Gaza War" seems to be carrying water for Israel. Hamas military engagement is a rather trivial component of the ongoing crisis. GreatCaesarsGhost 15:12, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
A trivial component of news coverage, perhaps, but a significant component of why the war continues. If Hamas were to release the hostages, that would merit an ITN nomination. Coining (talk) 18:12, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
That's specious CRYSTALBALLism, but in any case irrelevant. I'm not talking about news coverage or "why the war continues" but the actual course of events that we are attempting to document. Israel is conducting a genocide in Gaza, and unilateral attacks in Gaza, the West Bank, and several other countries, but the war part (i.e. multilateral conflict with an armed adversary) is a small part of the overall conflict. GreatCaesarsGhost 13:38, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
To be fair to Hamas, the Gaza strip is the only place they can fight. Hawkeye7 (discuss) 04:26, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Except that none of this would have happened if Hamas hadn't fought/attacked/slaughtered outside of Gaza on October 7. Cognizant though of WP:NOTAFORUM, I'll refrain from commenting on the appropriateness of being fair to Hamas. Coining (talk) 15:50, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
If you thought enough to be cognizant of NOTAFORUM, then you should erase the forum comment. Everyone understands the incursion 23 months ago is the pretense Israel is using for its current activities in Gaza, the West Bank, the UAE, etc. The point is that by considering any action by Israel to be a continuum of those events indefinitely, we are tacitly endorsing the Israeli argument that they are forever "responding" rather than acting as the aggressor. GreatCaesarsGhost 19:56, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose No one is waiting for the UN to know that a genocide is happening. Tradediatalk 01:49, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Strong Support Result of long investigation by UN Human Rights Council that includes official calls for action and that resulted in calls from at least 20 other major aid organizations.  selfwormTalk) 03:38, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose As much as it pains me to say it, this is unfortunately a situation where "in other news, water is wet" applies. There has been a fairly longstanding consensus amongst the world's authorities and scholars on human rights and genocide studies that this was the case. One additional UN commission adding its voice to that consensus is notable and merits coverage on Wikipedia, but at the same time, it is not so independently newsworthy as to escape the fact that this is otherwise captured by ongoing.

I just noticed 2025 US Caribbean naval deployment is the target article for this blurb.

Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez publicly supported the protests. Turini2 (talk) 13:15, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I feel the focus here is less about the results and more on the race's disruption by the protestors, given that the race itself isn't ITNR and best as I can tell hasn't been posted before. Masem (t) 14:08, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Support usually this wouldn't meet WP:ITNSIGNIF as not usually as much coverage as the Tour de France. But exceedingly more coverage this year due to 3 stages cancelled/shortened due to protests, so this event meets WP:ITNSIGNIF. And article quality is fine. Joseph2302 (talk) 14:24, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Strong support per Joseph; this is getting enough coverage to be worthy of being put in the news. Also, let’s put “Vuelta a España” in bold, per 2604’s vote (which is now deleted). 64.114 etc 15:44, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Just a procedural note that I deleted the IP vote due to ECR - given the context of the race’s cancellations/protests, I figured it fell under the ARBPIA area enough for ECR to be in effect. The Kip (contribs) 16:02, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

@64.114 etc The broadly-construed (i.e. anything even tangentially related) WP:ARBPIA area is subject to the extended-confirmed restriction, meaning that an editor has to be logged-in and extended-confirmed (account age of at least 30 days + at least 500 edits) in order to edit articles/content related to the Arab–Israeli (more often just Israeli–Palestinian) conflict.

Oppose per The Kip. The protests aren't in themselves notable enough for ITN, and we don't post the Vuelta either. I don't think combining the two things makes this suddenly big enough news. Maybe a good candidate for a DYK listing.  — Amakuru (talk) 20:59, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

+1, there are plenty of sporting events that get posted due to the notability of a particular event despite not being ITN/R!
Turini2 (talk) 07:13, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose as per The Kip. The race itself is not ITNR and the protests are covered by ongoing. --MtPenguinMonster (talk) 23:26, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support The race not being ITNR is not really relevant, as sporting events which are not ITNR can still successfully pass the criteria independently. Also, I don't think a bike race in Spain with pro-Palestine protests is so proximate to the Gaza war that it is 100% covered by ongoing. Because neither of those factors are dispositive, that leads me to conclude this can be posted. The protests together with general hype around Jonas Vingegaard have pushed it over the line; this is evidenced by the widespread international coverage as well as domestic political attention. FlipandFlopped ㋡ 03:41, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Flipandflopped there’s generally been a consensus that Gaza war protests fall under the Gaza war ongoing item. The Kip (contribs) 13:20, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
And I agree with that general consensus, but this is at the intersection of Gaza protests, Spanish politics, and a sports event which was already bordering on newsworthy enough to blurb, so I think it clears the bar. FlipandFlopped ㋡ 05:21, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support This is a Grand Tour comparable with the Tour de France and the protests seem to have been quite disruptive.
The ongoing entry isn't much help as finding this would be a needle in a haystack, buried deep down in huge secondary articles like Gaza War protests. Andrew🐉(talk) 07:23, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Theoretically support alt blurb 1 or 2, but oppose for now Although the Vuelta a España isn’t ITNR, it looks like it’s about as important as the Tour de France & these protests make this edition of the Vuelta a España more notable than other editions. However, the “Final stage in Madrid” section describes the protests as anti-genocide protests when English language sources don’t describe them as anti-genocide protests, so I have NPOV concerns about that section. Blaylockjam10 (talk) 00:07, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
This section has now been updated to a more neutral POV e.g. demonstrations against the Gaza war rather than "demonstrations against the genocide in Gaza" Turini2 (talk) 12:19, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose There is a reason this is not ITNR. The protest is not enough to make it pass ITN. Tradediatalk 01:05, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support Wide coverage and the pro-Palestinian protests make it notable, even if it wouldn't be without them. HadesTTW (he/him • talk) 01:56, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Opppose I follow a simple criteria for ITN sports, especially popular ones: if its on ITNR - merely look for article quality (despite the personal opposition to boat races and darts), if not, the achievement/result etc. needs to be independently significant for the notability bar to be met. Here both of these fail, neither is this a top cycling competition nor is Vingegaard winning Vuelta any special. All the supports here focus on the protests not the sport itself, so let us consider that separately. There have been massive protests against the genocide in places as supportive of Israel as the UK and Australia, these protests happened in Spain which is already officially against Israel and are unsurprising. Are any of these more important than the hudreds being killed daily in Gaza? I would stick to ongoing for this. Gotitbro (talk) 21:12, 20 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

It is incredibly rude to call a AGF nomination of a major sports results as "trivia". If you don't like sports, fine, but sports results are something we post commonly, and we do not require a sports results to be ITNR to be posted. That said, where we do have multiple ITNR for a specific sport, the posting of a non-ITNR sports results can be seen as lacking the significance as those listed at ITN.

Oppose on notability Results from the most significant sporting events may warrant a blurb; this isn't one of them. Dr Fell (talk) 22:43, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Comment Not sure why people considers this championship trivial since no reasoning was given in either case. I'm not sure either why it's not on the ITN/R list seeing how it's a reoccurring championship that is held every four years. That said, I concur with Howard the Duck in that the EuroBasket 2025 final should be the target article as with most other championship blurbs. I feel either article is not ready as the former has sourcing issues and the article about the final lacks prose. 5.57.242.223 (talk) 09:25, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose on notability and quality pretty sure this gets nominated most years, and rejected. Don't see coverage to meet WP:ITNQUALITY. And I certainly see no match summary prose on EuroBasket 2025 (the only reasonable target bold article- strongly oppose ALT0 with player listed in bold, as they're not the main focus of the event). Joseph2302 (talk) 16:33, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support - not sure what "little coverage" means; was front page news or at least received sustained coverage from French, Spanish, German, Greek, and even American newspapers. In France, it drew nearly a million viewers, 6 million in Germany, 20 million in Turkey, 70% of Greek viewers, nearly 2 million Finns, and 1 million Italians. On both an evidence and anecdotal basis (as someone who pays moderate attention to basketball), there definitely was a lot more engagement with EuroBasket this time around, both online and in person. This was the case stateside as well, meaning that it's gaining an international reach from the country with the premier basketball league.
With the game including noted Basketball giants like Antetokounmpo and the like, I think this is the year where one could argue for it's ITN posting. — Knightoftheswords 15:37, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

The full GMP statement is this: "Officers were called by a member of the public to attend Bowlacre Road, Hyde, Tameside, at 6:45am today where they found the body of a 46-year-old man. There are not currently believed to be any suspicious circumstances."
Greater Manchester Police". Martinevans123 (talk) 12:16, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Martinevans123: Sky Sports confirmed this:
Hatton was found dead at his home in Hyde on Sunday morning. Greater Manchester Police said they are not treating the death as suspicious.
This means he was confirmed dead on 14 September 2025, Sunday on Great Britain time.
Fabvill (Talk to me!) 13:19, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Yes, that's when it was confirmed, by GMP, that he was dead. It does not confirm when he actually died, which may have been one or more days before that. The inquest may establish the date, or it may not. Martinevans123 (talk) 13:29, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Sunday, which means 14 September is the date Hatton died on Great Britain time.

Nominator's comments: We rarely nominate boxing matches, but we do so sometimes, such as Mayweather's last fight and Usyk winning over Fury. This is an exceptional win and no one in this era has ever become undisputed champion in three different classes, by every boxing organization. HadesTTW (he/him • talk) 05:52, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Support on notability,
The Independent, The Mirror, CNN, BBC Sport, Al Jazeera. Boxing seems underrepresented at ITN, in the past decade we've only posted Mayweather-McGregor, Mayweather-Pacquiao, and Usyk-Fury Kowal2701 (talk) 10:58, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
LOL we've posted more boat races than boxing fights in the last 10 years? Howard the Duck (talk) 13:38, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Boxing is difficult because there's nothing like a championship series, only various title matches to determine who the belt-holder is in a given weight class. That's where here, that multiple sources saying having the title in three different weight classes makes this significant. Masem (t) 16:24, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
There are more boxing title fights in a month that boat races in a decade, but we still have posted more boat races than boxing fights in the past 10 years, despite the fact we haven't posted boat races for years now (LOL). Howard the Duck (talk) 16:29, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Exactly that there are that many title fights in a month is why its hard to see what makes sense to post for boxing, because of how routine title fights are. This case is different, due to the multiple titles now held by Crawford. (That s, this is news because of that achievement, not because of the fight itself). Masem (t) 16:34, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
It also doesn’t help that every title fight is promoted as "fight of the century" etc. Kowal2701 (talk) 10:43, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support on notability per Kowal, oppose on quality as the target article needs more prose. The Kip (contribs) 14:58, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Prose is now sufficiently updated. The Kip (contribs) 15:17, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Support on notability, oppose on quality coverage and significance meets WP:ITNSIGNIF, but needs prose about fight itself. Joseph2302 (talk) 16:13, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support on notability per Kowal. However, the article uses British and American spelling inconsistently. 64.114 etc 16:26, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Strong Oppose on notability. Agree with comment above that this is trivia. Absolutely not blurb-worthy. Dr Fell (talk) 16:19, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose on notability and quality.
I don't see why this is blurb-worthy, it appears to be sporting trivia to me. Black Kite (talk) 16:33, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose per Black Kite. EF5 17:36, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Comment I started work on a Fight Details section and I'll look into expanding the rest of the article to put it up to standards. I don't see why this doesn't pass for notability as some voters have suggested, a three-division undisputed world champion last happened by Henry Armstrong and that was in the 1930s. HadesTTW (he/him • talk) 17:38, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
It's unclear why it was notable then, either. This seems more like pub trivia. I can't imagine a newspaper running this on a front page – or even as a lead story in the Sport section. Perhaps a candidate for a future Did You Know. Dr Fell (talk) 22:51, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Was on the front page of September 14th edition of El Universal, Mexico's largest newspaper. Howard the Duck (talk) 23:49, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Strong support notability - three division undisputed champion, first in ages. If this can't make ITN for a boxing match, then what? Omnifalcon (talk) 22:45, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support on both accounts. I think the article is good and this would be a great feature. I'm impressed with the detailed prose presented here. Very nice work! ~Maplestrip/Mable (chat) 06:55, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Comment. Personally, I didn't see much coverage on the fight. Better for DYK if possible. CREditzWiki, editor (talk) 16:53, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose. While certainly INTERESTING, I do believe "undisputed in three weight classes" is something that falls in the trivia category. And I don't get this claim that boxing is underrepresented at ITN - we literally posted the first undisputed heavyweight championship in years when Usyk won it the first time, IIRC. All due respect to Crawford and his accomplishment, but I don't think being the undisputed super middleweight champion has the same pomp, at the very least if we're going by what the public is interested in. DarkSide830 (talk) 16:58, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Weak Oppose Mostly on notability grounds.
Crawford was already champion, did this change anything? –DMartin 22:45, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Crawford was WBA light middleweight champion; Canelo Álvarez was the undisputed super middleweight champion, and the titles on the line were Álvarez's championships. What changed was Álvarez no longer champion, and Crawford is now the undisputed super middleweight champion, aside from being WBA light middleweight champion. Howard the Duck (talk) 23:58, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Where's Andrew Davidson to point out that Canelo Álvarez vs. Terence Crawford had more page views than 2024–25 UEFA Champions League and 2025 UEFA Champions League final combined on the respective days of the event? Howard the Duck (talk) 00:10, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support Crawford accomplished something that hadn’t been done since 1938, which elevates this fight above typical boxing matches. Blaylockjam10 (talk) 19:15, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support - new record in popular sport that hasn't been achieved in 90 years; article of decent quality. — Knightoftheswords 13:52, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support I will quote myself from the Usyk nom: "As a general rule, the top achievement in each sport should meet WP:ITNSIGNIF. Boxing is certainly as popular as many of the sports we post, but with the myriad titles and classes, it can be difficult to specify which achievement merits posting. However, when this problem impacts other sports, we have addressed it with more posts: 3 per year for marathons, 4.5 for golf, 4 for horse races and 7 total for the two codes of rugby. Crowning a new undisputed champ seems to be as good a standard as any for boxing. By my count, this is the 12th occurrence across classes in the last 5 years. I think that's a pretty good sweet spot in terms of posting frequency." The opposes here seem focused on the fact that Crawford is champion across several weight classes, which should amplify his accomplishment not detract from it.
