This page provides a place to discuss new items for inclusion on In the news (ITN), a protected template on the Main Page (see past items in the ITN archives). Do not report errors in ITN items that are already on the Main Page here— discuss those at the relevant section of WP:ERRORS.
This candidates page is integrated with the daily pages of Portal:Current events. A light green header appears under each daily section – it includes transcluded Portal:Current events items for that day. You can discuss ITN candidates under the header.

Glossary[edit]
Blurbs are one-sentence summaries of the news story.
Altblurbs, labelled alt1, alt2, etc., are alternative suggestions to cover the same story.
A target article, bolded in text, is the focus of the story. Each blurb must have at least one such article, but you may also link non-target articles.
Articles in the Ongoing line describe events getting continuous coverage.
The Recent deaths (RD) line includes any living thing whose death was recently announced. Consensus may decide to create a blurb for a recent death.
All articles linked in the ITN template must pass our standards of review. They should be up-to-date, demonstrate relevance via good sourcing and have at least an acceptable quality.
Nomination steps[edit]
Make sure the item you want to nominate has an article that meets our minimum requirements and contains reliable coverage of a current event you want to create a blurb about. We will not post about events described in an article that fails our quality standards.
Find the correct section below for the date of the event (not the date nominated). Do not add sections for new dates manually – a bot does that for us each day at midnight (UTC).
Create a level 4 header with the article name (==== Your article here ====). Add (RD) or (Ongoing) if appropriate.
Then paste the {{ITN candidate}} template with its parameters and fill them in. The news source should be reliable, support your nomination and be in the article. Write your blurb in simple present tense. Below the template, briefly explain why we should post that event. After that, save your edit. Your nomination is ready!
You may add {{ITN note}} to the target article's talk page to let editors know about your nomination.
The better your article's quality, the better it covers the event and the wider its perceived significance (see WP:ITNSIGNIF for details), the better your chances of getting the blurb posted.
Purge this page to update the cache
Headers[edit]
When the article is ready, updated and there is consensus to post, you can mark the item as (Ready). Remove that wording if you feel the article fails any of these necessary criteria.
Admins should always separately verify whether these criteria are met before posting blurbs marked (Ready). For more guidance, check WP:ITN/A.
If satisfied, change the header to (Posted).
Where there is no consensus, or the article's quality remains poor, change the header to (Closed) or (Not posted).
Sometimes, editors ask to retract an already-posted nomination because of a fundamental error or because consensus changed. If you feel the community supports this, remove the item and mark the item as (Pulled).
Voicing an opinion on an item[edit]
Format your comment to contain "support" or "oppose", and include a rationale for your choice. In particular, address the notability of the event, the quality of the article, and whether it has been updated.
Please do...[edit]
ShortcutWP:ITNCDOWP:ITNCDO
Pick an older item to review near the bottom of this page, before the eligibility runs out and the item scrolls off the page and gets abandoned in the archive, unused and forgotten.
Review an item even if it has already been reviewed by another user. You may be the first to spot a problem, or the first to confirm that an identified problem was fixed. Piling on the list of "support!" votes will help administrators see what is ready to be posted on the Main Page.
Tell about problems in articles if you see them. Be bold and fix them yourself if you know how, or tell others if it's not possible.
Please do not...[edit]
ShortcutWP:ITNCDONTWP:ITNCDONT
Add simple "support!" or "oppose!" votes without including your reasons. Similarly, curt replies such as "who?", "meh", or "duh!" are not helpful. A vote without reasoning means little for us, please elaborate yourself.
Oppose an item just because the event is only relating to a single country, or failing to relate to one. We post a lot of such content, so these comments are generally unproductive.
Accuse other editors of supporting, opposing or nominating due to a personal bias (such as ethnocentrism). We at ITN do not handle conflicts of interest.
Comment on a story without first reading the relevant article(s).
Oppose a recurring item here because you disagree with the recurring items criteria. Discuss them here.
Use ITN as a forum for your own political or personal beliefs. Such comments are irrelevant to the outcome and are potentially disruptive.
Suggesting updates[edit]
There are two places where you can request corrections to posted items:
Anything that does not change the intent of the blurb (spelling, grammar, markup issues, updating death tolls etc.) should be discussed at WP:Errors.
Discuss major changes in the blurb's intent or very complex updates as part of the current ITNC nomination.

Nominator's comments: The Gaza war had a timeline for a long time until a year ago, when it was removed by Schwede66 (talk · contribs) for being orange tagged. This newer timeline article has no issues, so it should be re-added, especially to fit in with the Sudanese and Ukraine wars. — Knightoftheswords 23:27, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Nominator's comments: Part of the Asian Spring, like the Nepalese and Indonesian ones. ArionStar (talk) 14:16, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Wait We realistically cannot post every protest that happens around the world which remains otherwise peaceful (there were a small number of arrests and injuries in the trillion peso march but given the numbers est. to be >100k, that's trivial) or without an immediate impact (like in Nepal). The protests are not over so more could happen in the next few days. Masem (t) 14:33, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
At least 150,000 protestors as a joint demonstration. It's news in every single newspaper. ArionStar (talk) 14:38, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
ITN's threshold for political demonstrations is somebody dying due to the protest (or probably storming the capitol, you gotta read the opposes on that LOL); nobody died here that we know of, and the worst that happened was rioters stealing a three-star hotel vault. Now if rioters storm the Batasang Pambansa Complex, that'll be something. Howard the Duck (talk) 14:33, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
"ITN's threshold for political demonstrations is somebody dying due to the protest". Show me the precedent. ArionStar (talk) 14:35, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
ITN hasn't posted the several organized protests against Trump. Howard the Duck (talk) 14:37, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The precedent is what I meant would be protests with over 100,000 people being rejected due to lack of deaths. ArionStar (talk) 14:41, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Not 100,000 people, but Million People March. Howard the Duck (talk) 14:42, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
"being rejected" = nominated and opposed ≠ Wikipedia:In the news/Candidates/August 2013#Million People March. ArionStar (talk) 14:45, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Yes, but not for "lack of deaths" reason. In 2013 we didn't have so many people engaged on ITN. ArionStar (talk) 14:52, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Yeah, that was not posted but not due to people opposing it. 12 years later, we have Trump and raised the protests into a higher level something should violent happen before ITN posts it. Howard the Duck (talk) 15:05, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Oppose This may or may not be considered a part of the Asian Spring (nearly not as impactful as the outright revolutions in Nepal, Bangladesh and the massive protests in Indonesia) but this is not certainly not PPP 3.0, so I will hold my breath unless the Marcos government actually breaks. Gotitbro (talk) 17:56, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
In Metro Manila, there were actually two rallies, plus several other minor ones, then other ones elsewhere, but the articles should probably be merged into one. None of the major rally organizers were calling for the downfall of the Marcos government, as they judge that the one that will be replacing it will be worse for their interests. Also, everyone forgets about EDSA III. Howard the Duck (talk) 18:06, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
You mean the Estrada version of J6, I am sure no one in their right mind considers that a 'people power' revolution of any kind. Not a case of forgetting but a case of of sticking with facts. Gotitbro (talk) 22:08, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Suggesting altblurb so we don't have to list all 10 countries. Nice4What (talk · contribs) – (Thanks ♥) 14:12, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Noting that France et al. haven't recognized Palestinian statehood yet (the formal announcement is planned for tomorrow), only three countries have done it for now. Chaotic Enby (talk · contribs) 14:26, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I'm aware, I just have my doubts this blurb will be posted before then. Using the wording "several Western states" applies to 10 states, but can very well apply to 3 too. Nice4What (talk · contribs) – (Thanks ♥) 15:23, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose: I don' think that adding new entries to a table is enough updating of an article to count here. And also, this is the third time in less than a week that I see a weak proposal about something related to the Gaza War that is already ongoing. Cambalachero (talk) 14:21, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
As someone who’s voted against some of the other proposed items related to Gaza, the ongoing item existing doesn’t preclude us from posting a blurb if it’s judged to be of overt importance greater than simply the ongoing item. In my opinion, several major western powers recognizing a Palestinian state is one of those overly important items, and holds a wider relevance than just the war itself; keep in mind Gaza is only one part of the State of Palestine. The Kip (contribs) 00:32, 22 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose Not the first such countries, and until it actually means something (that the world will take some type of action to stop the war), mostly empty. As well as generally covered by the ongoing. Masem (t) 14:26, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Most of the State of Palestine, @Masem, is not Gaza. Gaza is only 365 km² while the West Bank is over 5,000 km². This is most certainly not covered by Ongoing! Nfitz (talk) 19:19, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose until it actually means something. Right now, it's a sovereign state without defined border, without a government and this is just politics. Until a real agreement is reached, like the Abraham Accords, this is just politics. Sir Joseph (talk) 15:18, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support altblurb1 – Noted to be "a historic diplomatic shift". Yes, many states have recognized Palestine before (quite obvious at this point), but there's no denying the diplomatic weight of these G20 countries' recognition. The US now remains the sole UNSC permanent member that opposes Palestinian statehood. This has been a months-long push for Western recognition that is widely covered in international news. Nice4What (talk · contribs) – (Thanks ♥) 15:22, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Of couse that it is "widely covered in international news". That's the bare minimum, I wouldn't expect any less. But there are dozens of such stories at any given moment and the template has a limited size, so "it's in the news right now" is not enough in itself. Cambalachero (talk) 15:33, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Wait until France and any others join in too, as this seems to be a loosely coordinated move.
Then see what the reactions are. Andrew🐉(talk) 15:36, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support but wait Reports indicate that ten countries are to recognize Palestine over the new two days. We should wait until the end of Monday before deciding until what the blurb entails. The reason I support it now is because it's a massive wave of recognition that involves heavy-hitter countries in terms of economic and military power,
going from precisely zero of the G7 countries recognizing Palestine to a small majority of 4, and pointedly shows Israel's growing international isolation given their long-term opposition to such a move. I don't get the people who oppose this by saying that this "just politics", especially the one user who negatively compared this to the Abraham Accords; that's literally what all international relations is. At this point, I'm convinced that there are some users who juat don't want Palestine to be discussed at all. Mount Patagonia (talk • contributions) 16:40, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support Alt1 but wait for French recognition since the initial blurb of "Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom" will be outdated very soon. Portugal will join those three before the day is over, France will join them tomorrow, and Andorra, Luxembourg, and Malta will join them this week. As Nice4What already explained, this is a major diplomatic shift.  Vanilla  Wizard

–DMartin 17:07, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support ALT1 per above, but wait a bit - as noted, some of the recognitions are officially happening in the next day or two. The Kip (contribs)
Support but oppose alt1 I think this event is significant, but for the altblurb I oppose the phrase "In an effort led by France". I've checked The Atlantic, NYT, WAPO, Politico, BBC, and Haaretz. The WAPO gets closest, saying it was in coordination with France, and the BBC notes that France was the first to announce their intention to recognize, but neither say the effort was led by France. 1brianm7 (talk) 17:40, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Here are some sources you might've missed:
Associated Press: France drives other nations to recognize Palestinian state
Politico: "France is leading the effort"
Washington Post: "The three nations became the biggest countries to recognize Palestine, acting in coordination with France..."
Bloomberg: "French President Emmanuel Macron has led the way on the plan to recognize Palestinian statehood"
Times of Israel: "The UK’s expected announcement on Sunday is part of a French-led initiative to recognize a State of Palestine"
Telegraph: "Mr Macron has spearheaded a movement among Western leaders to recognise Palestinian statehood, in opposition to the US. France became the first G7 nation to make this pledge in July."
French lobbying other Western states has been previously reported (see July 2025 Conference on the Implementation of the Two-State Solution § Planned recognition of Palestine). Nice4What (talk · contribs) – (Thanks ♥) 18:55, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support Major development, clearly rises above the war (we would post such recognition for any other state). This is the fallout of the war and genocide, we cannot really bury our heads in the sand for absolutely major developments that stem from it. Comparing the recognition of an entire state to defence pacts (Abraham Accords) is very callous. Gotitbro (talk) 18:06, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support - huge story with UK, Canada, Australian recognition - this is the English Wikipedia after all. But where's France's recognition - I'm confused why I only see stuff such as today's interview with Macron, which talks about the timing of opening the French embassy in Palestine - but not the actual recognition. Nfitz (talk) 19:24, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
France is scheduled to formally announce recognition tomorrow. Additionally, while this is the English-language Wikipedia, it is an international project, and shouldn't give special weight to English-speaking countries when deciding what is or isn't in the news. Chaotic Enby (talk · contribs) 19:32, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Is there a written policy on that @Chaotic Enby? I keep criticizing all the ITN nominations every time Trump trumps or a Yank gets shot, that always get closed with "good faith nomination" niceties ... but I hasn't realized those that do this were actually violating policy! Nfitz (talk) 19:44, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
It is at Wikipedia:Neutral point of view/FAQ#Anglo-American focus. Chaotic Enby (talk · contribs) 19:51, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Which remains an essay, interpreting policy. Only pointing to the moribund WP:CSB. I think I'm yet to say BIAS in a discussion without getting a "what can we do if the (English/Western) sources themselves are biased" from someone. Still I think it's enough, as that's almost half the G7 right there, and surely the vast majority of the G20 by now. Nfitz (talk) 20:32, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Question I'm trying to find sources if this is the case, but given that the US was the sole veto of the g7 at the UN meeting on Friday to demand a ceasefire, is this major action a response to that? If so, that should be indicated in the blurb. But if not, the blurb needs to establish why these countries compared to the other 130 countries that recognize Palenstein statehood is that important (!voters are mentioning that but that should be more explicit) Masem (t) 19:44, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
This long precedes that vote (which sounds like so many). For example, @Masem, Canada announced their intent to do this in September both on September 15th and July 30th. Nfitz (talk) 19:48, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
then the blurb should establish why these 4 countries' recognition is a major turning point, which I think we can pull from sources. Masem (t) 19:52, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
These recognitions are the result of a conference in July – July 2025 Conference on the Implementation of the Two-State Solution. Andrew🐉(talk) 20:28, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Not a response to the US veto, this move has been in the making since May. Nice4What (talk · contribs) – (Thanks ♥) 20:29, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support this is 2/5ths of the permanent members of the security council recognizing Palestine as a state.
That's a huge move in the diplomatic world.
Palestine was previously recognized by Russia and China, so this moves Palestine from a minority of permanent security council members to a clear majority, with the United States as the lone opposer.
There's still great power holdouts like Germany, Italy, and Japan, but overall this movement is significant and significant enough for ITN. NorthernFalcon (talk) 21:43, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I wouldn't hold my breath for two of the holdouts, deeply involved in the worst crime against humanity. Gotitbro (talk) 22:13, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Oppose This is a contentious topic and the issue of genocide is an especially contentious one.
The policy directs us to "err on the side of caution" but this would be an inflammatory addition and the previous discussion demonstrated a lack of consensus for posting it.
As the issue is amply covered within the existing Gaza war entry, there's no need for a second link. Andrew🐉(talk) 06:38, 20 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Wikipedia is not a reliable source. Andrew🐉(talk) 20:09, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose per Andrew, and because it is covered in ongoing. No one doubts that Israel is also committing atrocities, but let us not forget that genocide is a crime, a legal concept that is declared by criminal courts (in this case, it will be the ICC that rules on it), not us. There is a risk of bias.
_-_Alsor (talk) 10:02, 20 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Oppose It should be very clear from the ongoing Gaze entry about what most consider to be a genocide going on there, in addition that we still cannot yet, as Wikipedia, call it a genocide factually as others have pointed out. Masem (t) 12:48, 20 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose The Gaza war is considered contentious (as can be seen by the redacted non EC comments above), and thus it's better for us to remain neutral and err on the side of caution. Trying to push this onto ITN time and time again feels (again) like an attempt to right great wrongs, which is not the purpose of either Wikipedia nor ITN. Cheers, atque supra! Fakescientist8000 16:26, 20 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Support in principle. We can add it in parentheses next to the Gaza war. I don’t understand those who say that we—as Wikipedia—cannot call it a genocide when that word is already included in the article’s title. If you object the title for the sake of caution, you should advertise the problem on the article’s talk page, not argue against it here as this is not a place to discuss other stuff.--Kiril Simeonovski (talk) 19:13, 20 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Support Gaza Ethnic Cleansing - Genocide is always difficult to define - so a compromise; I don't think anyone would disagree that Isreal's plan to move Palestinians from Gaza is, by definition ethnic cleansing. Nfitz (talk) 04:00, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
This is incorrect. Genocide has a solid definition under international criminal law ("acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group"), while ethnic cleansing is a euphemism that does not have a recognised legal definition. --Grnrchst (talk) 09:51, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
OI would oppose that wording.
We shouldn't use euphemisms.
–DMartin –DMartin 17:04, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The problem is that requires proof that Israel is trying to destroy the Palestinians, rather than move them elsewhere. We've ran into this problem here before with rape, because legal definitions vary from place to place; while digital penetration is rape in some jurisdictions, it's only sexual assault in other jurisdictions. I've never heard "ethnic cleansing" (or sexual assault) called an euphemism before - though I do see a note in the dictionary that "This and related terms are often regarded as euphemistic in intention". I see ethnic cleansing as an easier bar, that no one could dispute, given the announcements by Israel of clearing Gaza, and the US announcements about planning to build resorts there. I just don't see how "Destroy" is proven in a court of law (and it hasn't been). Here's a question then @Grnrchst and @Dmartin969, given the high bar and non-universal acceptance of the Rome Statute genocide definition, and the possibly euphemistic "ethnic cleansing", what else could be used. Maybe we simply change the Ongoing from "Gaza War" to "Gaza".

Support. I'm not an expert in this topic, and I usually try to steer clear of Israel–Palestine issues on Wikipedia because I have neither the expertise nor the time and energy to become embroiled in that saga. But looking at the talk page of the Gaza genocide, article I see that an RFC closed today which effectively endorses the view that calling it a genocide can now be done in Wikipedia's voice. In particular, the lead now states that while the label was "controversial at first, it is now supported by a wide academic consensus". As such, with the WP:DUEWEIGHT opinion and Wikipedia's voice apparently now calling this a genocide without equovocation, I think this is a clear-cut topic that should be in ongoing. There are some opposes above based on this being already covered by the Gaza war listing, but it seems to me that if, as implied by the RFC result, this is truly regarded as a genocide by scholars, then it is clearly significant enough to be listed separately. We wouldn't have vetoed the Rwandan genocide as an ongoing topic just because it was "already covered by the Rwandan Civil War" would we?  — Amakuru (talk) 14:11, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
We currently have a parallel situation with the Russo-Ukraine war – see Allegations of genocide of Ukrainians in the Russo-Ukrainian War, "According to multiple national governments, international organisations, independent experts and media outlets, Russia and its ally Belarus are committing genocide against the Ukrainian people..."

Amakuru referred to other content with the hypothetical example of "Rwandan genocide as an ongoing topic".
Ukraine is a more relevant example because Russian invasion of Ukraine is actually in ongoing right now and there are similar accusations of genocide in that case.

I'm not familiar with the scholarly scene that is concerned by the allegations of genocide in Ukraine, but I don't reckon that it is nearly as vivid as the scene concerned by Gaza genocide (see Template:Expert opinions in the Gaza genocide debate), and I don't think there is as much consensus among scholars and experts (more than 280 sources in favor of the characterisation, quoting more than 1000 scholars/experts), if it is the case, then I believe we should start arguing for the legitimacy of a Ukraine genocide claim, in its talk page, not here — 🧀Cheesedealer !!!⚟ 20:31, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Ongoing is not the right place to keep track of such complexities because an ongoing entry is just a link.
Blurbs are better because they provide some brief narrative to explain the event and issue.
There was no consensus for a blurb in this case and so it seems quite improper for an ongoing entry to be proposed when it would be a worse way of listing the matter at ITN. Andrew🐉(talk) 21:23, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Ongoing exists simply to provide readers with a quick link to topics that are in the news and deemed to be significant, but in a longterm fashion rather than as a point-in-time event. Often ongoing events begin with a big-bang event that is noteworthy as a blurb. Occasionally though, it's something like this that is more cumulative with ongoing status despite no blurb event significant enough by itself. The war has been going on for two years now, but it's only recently and in a gradual fashion that scholarly consensus has reached the conclusion it seemingly has, according to the RFC result.  — Amakuru (talk) 23:16, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support. I am commenting with the understanding that this is a contentious topic; it is a subject area I have largely avoided due to how contentious it is, and (to my recollection) I have only edited a single article in this area in over 6 years on the platform. But in this case I feel it necessary to add my voice. As Amakaru above has pointed out, an RfC on the Gaza genocide has established that there is academic consensus that it should be considered a genocide and it can be called as such in wikivoice; this conclusion is supported by the International Association of Genocide Scholars, Doctors Without Borders, Amnesty International, a UN special committee and an independent UN commission, the latter of which presented evidence finding the State of Israel to be carrying out 4 of the 5 genocidal acts outlined in the Genocide Convention (which legally defines genocide). I understand the people that say it is already covered by the Gaza war, but the genocide itself is being covered on a daily basis by the international press and scholarly publications. I also understand the appeals to exercise caution above, but think some might be mistaking silence for neutrality. I worry that arguments against posting are veering into arguments to avoid, i.e. basing our decisions on appropriateness of a story or whether or not it might cause offence. At the end of the day, the Gaza genocide meets the In the News criteria for article quality and the significance of the event. For these reasons and more, I am in support of it being added to the ongoing section, in brackets next to the Gaza war. --Grnrchst (talk) 15:04, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support, obviously a contentious topic but "Gaza war" is clearly inadequate to cover the scope of what is happening in Gaza presently. Morgan695 (talk) 17:43, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support, per Amakuru.VR (Please ping on reply) 18:07, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support, per Amakuru and Grnrchst. The argument that it is already covered by "ongoing" doesn't cut it because the war article covers the conflict between Israel and the Palestinian factions and doesn't give a lot of weight to the genocide itself (rightfully ofc). The genocide deserves to have its own "ongoing" entry considering how abundantly covered it is in the media, serving WP:NEUTRALITY and to avoid WP:FALSEBALANCE. These latter policies should be sufficient also to address the argument stating how such an addition would be inflammatory especially considering how it is largely supported in the scholarly scene — 🧀Cheesedealer !!!⚟ 18:32, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Comment a major problem here is that ITN's ongoing line lacks the context of article space (where on the article the lede quickly explains that this is still a controversial wording though has broader agreement in scholarly sources). "Genocide" is still a word that carries criminality with it, and without the context of article space, just adding "Gaza genocide" in parathesis after the Gaza conflict is going to to be controversial itself without the space to contextualize this. That's a major issue specific to ITN and lack of space to give the needed context, because otherwise it would appear that WP in Wikitext supports calling it a genocide. I don't know if there a briefer wording that could be used like "(accusations of genocide)" that would step that claim out of Wikivoice (which is what the article itself does too). Masem (t) 20:25, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Masem: Wikipedia already supports calling it a genocide simply because the article is named ‘Gaza genocide’, and this already has potentially huge implications (please see this letter from the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform addressed to the CEO of the Wikimedia Foundation). So, opposing this on the grounds that it’s contentious to call it a ‘genocide’ is thwarting consensus reached elsewhere on Wikipedia.--Kiril Simeonovski (talk) 20:39, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Being titled like that is mitigated that by the nature of the first lede paragraph that explains it is not a fact in Wikivoice, and my scan of the article shows no significant place where it is reiterated as a genocide as Wikivoice-fact but always with some type of attribution or the like. The context of the article space provides that room. A listing at ITN ongoing does not. Masem (t) 21:29, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The opening paragraph reads The Gaza genocide is the ongoing systematic destruction of the Palestinian people in Gaza by Israel by means of blockade, invasion, and bombing of the strip with the manifest intent of senior Israeli leaders in the context of the war that is taking place there. Although this characterisation of Israel's campaign in Gaza was controversial at first, it is now supported by a wide academic consensus. where the last sentence clearly states that it’s no longer controversial and there’s wide academic consensus. I don’t see how this mitigates the genocide claim.--Kiril Simeonovski (talk) 21:53, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
But still doesn't state it definitely in Wikivoice. The article doesn't step on that line, just edges as close as possible from a NPOV angle. Masem (t) 23:24, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Masem, I believe there is now consensus that wikipedia should describe the events in Gaza as "genocide as a fact in Wikipedia voice" (although Beland can correct me if I'm reading their close incorrectly).VR (Please ping on reply) 00:09, 22 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Just out of curiosity (really for the purpose of learning), what would it sound like if it was stated in wikivoice? — 🧀Cheesedealer !!!⚟ 00:11, 22 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Comment If this is to be blurbed, there needs to be a significant amount of reasons why he was considered a major figure (accidental death from scuba diving, I don't makes "death as the story" here). The sources that I am seeing about his death, even though there are tributes made, aren't the same type of level I'd expect for a major entertainment figure, but I could be wrong. Masem (t) 13:44, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Zubeen Garg was like a big figure in Both Bengal and Assam, an entire generation (Including me) grew up listening to his song on Television. From what I know, he was such a big deal in Assam that an entire bridge, and statue was made in his name BengalMC (talk) 13:52, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I do see that in the sources, but we don't the idea of a major figure simply on fame or popularity. We're not looking necessarily at internataion or national significance but I feel from what I read in these obit sources that he's recognized across India but that's mainly a popularity thing, he didn't, for example, transform the Indian music industry or similar scale of significance. Masem (t) 13:56, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
So, if you see current all Assamese news everything is abt the memory of Zubeen Garg and etc.
He transformed the Assamese music scene with a lot of people that I personally know + more saying that he was the major successor to Bhupen Hazarika and right now there is no one to success him other than maybe Papon but he is mainly focusing on Bollywood and other parts of music other than Assamese music so he (Late Garg) definitely does deserve the spot.
Right now there were lakhs (tens of thousands) of people following the ambulance carrying the body of Late Garg and just for touching the ambulance people were pushing and fighting around so you can really see the impact that he has made.
If you look at recent visuals the amount of gamusas (basically symbolic cloth that shows that a person is very respected) on the ambulance maybe in the thousands (I'm not sure).
I won't elaborate on the cultural significance as I was born in a different generation(Gen Alpha) but I still deeply respect him and right now every one in the Assamese community is saying we should never forget Zubeen Garg, with a bunch of people even crying and even I ws even though I was born in Gen A.

Support RD, Oppose Blurb I supported Liam Payne for a blurb as there the circumstances of the death itself received headline coverage but it wasn't ultimately blurbed AFAIK. While the death here is unusual, the death is not the story here. We then turn to the "transforming" criteria, the figure is certainly notable in the Assam region of India (and Assamese music broadly) but for ITN we have to look for significance beyond the regional level which hasn't been evidenced here. A similar nom that I remember was of KK (singer) where the death was the story but it wasn't ultimately blurbed either. So, I oppose a blurb here though an RD is perfectly fine, all basic criteria are met for that. Gotitbro (talk) 17:13, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

I'm not convinced this should be posted, but I'll play devil's advocate:International agreements of various sorts frequently get signed, including partnership agreements, but just how common are actual mutual defense pacts of this sort? The article Defense pact only lists five after 1992, with this being one of them. It's possible that the list is incomplete, but that doesn't seem "extremely common". 98.170.164.88 (talk) 04:34, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Comment This is similar to the Australia/PNG pact in that it extends and formalises existing close relations.
And it's being made public to deter potential aggressors.
The specific trigger seems to be the recent Israeli strike on Doha which the US did nothing about.
The target article doesn't comment on the weakening of US credibility as a security guarantor in the region – a point which appears in the sources.
Such implications and ramifications take time to work out in practice so, like the Australia/PNG case, I'm not sure we should headline this as a big announcement. Andrew🐉(talk) 06:27, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Nfitz (talk) 21:52, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
For one, the article has none of the specifics of the agreement in it, so it is impossible to tell what the significance is. Also, generally such agreements need ratification by the legislative bodies of the signing nations before it can be realized. Masem (t) 23:46, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

While I agree with the posting here, disagree with "Every international defense agreement/pact/treaty should be posted". Not each one of these might be significant and we will have to decide the merits on a case by case basis. The siginificance here comes from the impact of nuclear weapons, other cases may lack such lynchpin factors. Gotitbro (talk) 17:21, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Support I was initially ambivalent, but after thinking about it, I would probably support posting any new mutual defense pact. This one seems to be significant on its own merits. Both countries are major regional powers with various entanglements and tensions.

Article updatedNominator's comments: This is an ongoing story in the news that just keeps going and getting worse; just look at the history here of the full article. This new development, I just saw in the news. This is a huge escalation of things it seems in US politics after the assassination of Charlie Kirk. Please look here for the particular new development: Detention and deportation of American citizens in the second Trump administration#Mass arrest of New York officials by ICE (15). Thanks. — Very Polite Person (talk/contribs) 03:17, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support The mass arrest of state officials is unusual and notable. --MtPenguinMonster (talk) 03:26, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose This is not the first time that state officials have been arrested in trying to check up on detained immigrants held in ICE centers (last time they were only held for a few hours or overnight, so it was just for show). Its also far from the biggest news related to US politics right now, that being the attack on the First Amendment via the cancellation of Jimmy Kimmel's show (which I'm not suggesting should be posted because its US politics and of NTRUMP). Masem (t) 03:55, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I was surprised that no one nominated the cancellation of Jimmy Kimmel's show. Hawkeye7 (discuss) 04:28, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
We should say "suspension," not "cancellation," at least as far as we know so far, for accuracy's sake, right? Ryan Reeder (talk) 04:48, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Its a news story but not really yet at the stage of being an encyclopedic article because what's happened after rests on a whole bunch of hypotheticals, opinions, and informed analysis. Many possible ends of this story would just be fizzling out of the news, while some I can see as potentially being far more encyclopedic and ITN worthy. That's the difficulty with most stories that involve politics, there's no clear endpoint to say if it is really significant from the long-term, encyclopedic view compared with the short-term, daily coverage and endless talking heads of the media. Masem (t) 05:05, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
STRONGEST OPPOSE per Masem. 64.114 etc 15:03, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose The New York Times article makes clear this isn't a "mass arrest" so much as a political stunt. Brad Lander, one of those arrested, used this same tactic in June with the same result. The blurb is inaccurate, and arrests of trespassers in federal buildings is not notable. Dr Fell (talk) 04:05, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Ongoing The nomination says that this is an ongoing story and they are right.
So, this should be an ongoing nomination. Andrew🐉(talk) 06:30, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Re Charlie Kirk': since his blurb was bumped off ITN, shouldn't he appear in RD? 188.27.82.108 (talk) 07:16, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

_-_Alsor (talk) 10:14, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose per Masem.
_-_Alsor (talk) 10:02, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose The page reads too much like original research - as if it's trying to make a point. Still, I don't see it being particularly noteworthy - this kind of abuse isn't unusual in flawed democracies like that one. If we had an ongoing for every individual country where stuff happens, we'd have 100+ ongoings. I'm surprised the article hasn't gone to AfD to tell the truth. Nfitz (talk) 14:10, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
That article demonstrates a lot of the NOTNEWS problem on WP (editors trying to document every tiny event in some fashion than the big picture), as well as a RGW-type problem (along the lines of "we have to document these improper arrests made by this admin to show how bad it is"). Masem (t) 14:22, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose big news, but domestic news. It doesn't have that much of a big impact. Chorchapu (talk | edits) 16:15, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose *Yawn*, not another domestic-based WP:ITNTRUMP nomination. Doesn't have a worldwide impact.

In the US I don't see this getting "all the news"-type coverage; Jimmy Kimmel getting (wrongfully) yanked by the FCC is getting way more coverage. EF5 14:21, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
On AP, it's the second big article (Live updates: Trump and Starmer sign tech deal worth billions of dollars), on the Guardian US the visit is also the second (Live: Trump suggests Starmer use military to stop illegal immigration and repeats wind power attacks), on CNN it's the first item on the left (During press conference with Starmer, Trump says Putin ‘let me down’), on NBC it's on top (Trump's UK visit gets political after royal pageantry), and on NPR it's in the second row (Starmer says he and Trump talked about support for Ukraine, pressure on Russia). While on many of these the Kimmel story is higher or bigger it's a big international deal in a big, highly-reported-on state visit that lots of people and news sites are talking about. Chorchapu (talk | edits) 15:10, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose no clear indication that this is really "historic", and instead seems more along the same negotiations on tariffs and investments from this admin. Masem (t) 14:40, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose it's not even mentioned in the linked article. Secretlondon (talk) 14:42, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose. Is there anything about this deal that makes it particularly notable? It seems to just be one of many that occur globally all the time. Even the linked article isn’t specifically about it and it’s already overly detailed imo. La Ovo (talk) 14:44, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose no evidence that it's actually historic, not even mentioned at target article, and even if it was, it'd likely be a minimal paragraph of content. Doesn't meet WP:ITNSIGNIF. Joseph2302 (talk) 15:05, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Oppose as ongoing, as this would already be covered by the Gaza ongoing. If this was meant to cover the drone strike (given the sources listed), that was last week (Sept 9) and that would make this very stale as a news item. Masem (t) 03:22, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose as covered by ongoing. The Kip (contribs) 04:47, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Oppose per above. Suggest that it's unlikely to be blurbworthy whatever the case, given that it's covered by ongoing, and we may soon have another Gaza blurb This post was made by orbitalbuzzsaw gang (talk) 08:06, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose - definitely covered by ongoing, and if it were not, I would not consider this activity in itself to be anything like significant enough to merit a slot in Ongoing for itself. GenevieveDEon (talk) 08:58, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I feel like this kind of article would've been a better "ongoing" target than our indefinite war articles. I like how it's specific and I would love to be able to feature the work that is being put into this article. I think it would be a lot more helpful to readers to feature articles like these than to feature the largest-scale article possible. Sadly, currently, we don't really have a space for this kind of ongoing subject. ~Maplestrip/Mable (chat) 10:14, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Its not even a good ongoing, which is meant for stories with near daily news coverage and updates. This flotilla pops up in the news every now and then but definitely nowhere close to that daily coverage we expect. Masem (t) 12:00, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose per above. Mayyybe we could blurb it if something major happens with the current one but definitely not an ongoing and we'd do the article about the specific flottilla.. Chorchapu (talk | edits) 13:12, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Comments should focus on whether the quality of the article meets WP:ITNRD.Nominator's comments: Redford's very much in reasonable territory of being a major figure in Hollywood, though I feel the article could do a bit more on legacy for this point, but I'm going to consider a blurb already here since I know it would otherwise be added later.
However, the article is unsourced in several places, so its not ready for RD yet. Masem (t) 12:19, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Support RD Article is well-developed and in a good enough state although the Personal life and death section is a little proselineish.
Since that covers the substantive update it could probably do with fleshing out a little.
Not supporting a blurb but not violently against one either, over the course of his career yes he really is one of the greats, but his heyday was several decades ago and I'm not sure that he reaches the requisite threshold of current popular notability, i.e. are enough readers going to actively click through to justify a blurb? 3142 (talk) 12:43, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
We don't make a distinction if a person's significance was well in the past or more recent, only that it is well demonstrated. Masem (t) 13:10, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
You may not; I do.
Notability for this purpose is a different threshold to general articles.
ITN is supposed to be a service to the readership, to enable readers to easily find articles of interest.
It is not our role to tell the reader what they should be interested in, and if no-one is the coverage is entirely pointless.
Rather it is better directed to something people are interested in. 3142 (talk) 16:35, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
"he reaches the requisite threshold of current popular notability, i.e. are enough readers going to actively click through to justify a blurb?" this is not a requirement for blurb, because we have blurbed people who are not that well-known, but yes, enough readers will actively click. BilboBeggins (talk) 18:22, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose at present: too much unsourced material for MP inclusion. Would support RD only once the article is up to spec. Adding: I suspect this will end up being posted as a blurb, not because it's justified, but because of the usual fanboy voting will ignore the purpose of having RD. - SchroCat (talk) 12:53, 16 September 2025 (UTC) (Addendum added SchroCat (talk) 15:59, 16 September 2025 (UTC)) Moved to supporting, but still RD only.

Weak support blurb given his sheer number of accolades and resulting influence. Oppose on quality as article still needs a lot of work, however. The Kip (contribs) 13:21, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support blurb. Has two Academy Awards, created Sundance. "In his ’70s heyday, few actors possessed Redford’s star wattag", "as a movie star in his prime, few could touch him". "A godfather for independent film". [3]. Has starred in three films that won Academy Award for Best Picture. That is a shoe-in for blurb.
BilboBeggins (talk) 14:05, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Simply having won or starred in award winning films is not sufficient, but it is noted that he was considered one of the great actors in part because he won those awards, in addition to the other stuff he did to promote indie films and establishing Sundance. Masem (t) 14:19, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I know that being Oscar winner only does not automatically qualify for blurb. But winning competitive Oscar and getting Honrary Award is rare, and he won almost every major award.
And he is one offew figures who are not only householda names, but are also tranformative. BilboBeggins (talk) 16:50, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I think the fact that his “heyday” was 50 years ago is also relevant. –DMartin 01:10, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Not in doubt here but it would be helpful to add this to the existing death and legacy section (which is already being done) to better justify the blurb for others. Masem (t) 14:44, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support Blurb He was a very well known actor and director and had a very lengthy career. Also. he helped founding the Sundance festival which has became one of the most famous movie festivals in the world, therefore a very notable legacy. LiamKorda 14:38, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Support blurb—A highly transformative and iconic figure in both cinema and beyond. Founder of the Sundance Film Festival, used his platform to elevate major social issues of our time, Academy Awards as both an actor and director, etc. I feel he meets the high threshold for blurbing an actor.

Comment @3142:, @The Kip:, @Masem:, @SchroCat:, @NoonIcarus:: I've expanded the legacy section which depicts Redford's impact not only as a Hollywood icon, but for his impact on Independent films and how influential he was as an activist/environmentalist. I've also beefed up the article with sources so there's no more cn tags. The argument of the blurb can be seen for his impact not just towards Hollywood films, but also for independent filmmaking and for his environmentalism efforts. --TDKR Chicago 101 (talk) 16:45, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Oppose blurb Redford was obviously a big star in his 1970s heyday but I wouldn't say he's the very most recognised and transformative US film actor of his generation. Now, one could say he doesn't need to be - he was huge, much-awarded, features in some highly-acclaimed films - but I think we as users ought to be thinking about the long game with figures like this. I don't wish to sound morbid but there are a *lot* of very notable living North American film actors in their seventies, eighties and nineties that we are likely to discuss blurbing here in the next ten years or so, most of whom made their mark at a similar time to Redford. Dick Van Dyke, Mel Brooks, Clint Eastwood, William Shatner, Robert Duvall, Alan Alda, Shirley MacLaine, Woody Allen, Warren Beatty, Jack Nicholson, Morgan Freeman, Dustin Hoffman, Jane Fonda, Elliott Gould, Jon Voight, Harvey Keitel, F. Murray Abraham, Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Faye Dunaway, Sylvester Stallone, Barbra Streisand, Harrison Ford, Goldie Hawn, Christopher Walken, Michael Douglas, Steve Martin, Tommy Lee Jones, Susan Sarandon, Diane Keaton, Arnold Schwarzenegger (he is Austrian and American), Richard Dreyfuss, Samuel L. Jackson, Meryl Streep, Sigourney Weaver, Richard Gere and John Travolta are just a few names that spring to mind. There's also various Hollywood directors (Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese, George Lucas, Steven Spielberg, James Cameron), composers (John Williams) and non-American actors nevertheless associated with US film (Rita Moreno, Julie Andrews, Michael Caine and many more). All of these people are elderly, most of them are octogenarians or older, and I think it's fair to say that quite a few of them are dead certs for blurbs. Will all of their deaths be blurbed? Perhaps not but I think it's fair to say that most of them would be proposed and that a great many of them would get through ITN with the system and attitudes we have currently. There is going to be a real deluge of these figures, for many reasons (if I was to offer a pithy summary, Hollywood boomed in the 1960s and 70s and its hits were kept alive by television and home media, becoming part of a collective experience that is less achievable today) and with that in mind, I think we perhaps need to be somewhat brutal with who gets in and who doesn't.Humbledaisy (talk) 18:19, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Elliout Gould, F. Murray Abraham, Goldie Hawn, Steve Martin are nowhere near. Dick Van Dyke never won an Oscar, so did Harvey Keitel.
And I don't see any sense of discussing the blurbs for persons who are alive. Some of persons you mentioned will be blurbed, so I don't know how them possibly being on the same scale is argument for not blurbing Redford. BilboBeggins (talk) 18:43, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
If you're not interested in discussing the blurbs for alive people, why did you tell me which ones you think are nowhere near? As I said, "I think it's fair to say that most of them would be proposed and that a great many of them would get through ITN with the system and attitudes we have currently". I didn't say I think they'll all be blurbed. I just wanted to demonstrate the sheer amount of notable, award-winning US film actors of a certain vintage and the problem it may pose to ITN.Humbledaisy (talk) 19:26, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
"If you're not interested in discussing the blurbs for alive people, why did you tell me which ones you think are nowhere near?"
I am simply saying you can't compare with Redford people you can't compare with him.
Blurb discussions taking place won't hurt anyone, if we don't want them to happen, then we should make some definite rules for blurbing. BilboBeggins (talk) 19:48, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Let's say that's 50 ppl in that list, all with a likely chance to die from old age over the next ten years. That's five whole blurbs a year, which in no way weighs down ITN, but that also assumes quality is there and that it's clear of their legacy to the industry. That last part, I don't know how true that is for all on the list., as just being a star from that period is not a indicator of being a major figure. Redfprd's significance has been demonstrated but I'm not sure if that can be said for all of them listed. Masem (t) 19:15, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I'd suggest that five US film actors a year would be quite a significant weight on ITN. Combine it with UK film actors of the same vintage and it's going to be a great amount of one kind of notable person. That's all I'm trying to say. As I say, the names were off the top of my head and to make a point - I'm by no means suggesting they'll all be nominated or all be blurbed.Humbledaisy (talk) 19:26, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
John Travolta, aged 71, is likely to die withing the next 10 years? I haven't checked any other ages. Perhaps 30 to 40% of that dies in the next 10 years. So even less blurbs! Nfitz (talk) 23:29, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I guess I'll repeat myself again. I said that those names are likely to come up "in the next ten years or so". Travolta is also the youngest person of the many I named by almost five years. I don't want to grumble but I go to great pains to make myself clear on ITN, to anticipate and address any potential misunderstandings or unanswered questions (hence the length of my comment) and I still have to repeat myself.Humbledaisy (talk) 15:59, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
A lot of actors at RD and blurb discussions fail on sourcing, so that alone will likely cut down that list. I also doubt all of the actors you mention could get consensus to be blurbed even if the quality is sufficient. I see a few names on there that would be shoe-ins, a few that I highly doubt would make it, and a lot that could go either way. We're not going to have that much of a problem here. QuicoleJR (talk) 20:29, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I think there ought to be a discussion about establishing standards for blurb-worthy individuals.
My sensibilities may be more inclusive than some; I would include pretty much all of the names on that list, as they are household names and recognizable to a general audience of the English-speaking world, as well as many outside of that audience.
But where do we draw the line?
What system of measurements should we use?
Where would I draw the line, at least in terms of those in the entertainment industry?
Among some of the oldest in that field, I would probably put it somewhere around June Lockhart, William Daniels, Rosemary Harris, Marion Ross, Vera Miles, Joanne Woodward, John Astin, and Barbara Eden (all of whom are over 94).
Some of their roles are well-remembered, some quite fondly, but generally they are either known for primarily one role, or their work is much more familiar to the general public than their names, or in the case of Joanne Woodward, is still a bit overshadowed by someone else (her husband, Paul Newman), and derives at least some of her familiarity on the strength of that connection.
The names that Humbledaisy included are all known by their own names first, not for any single role, and therefore, it would be the death of the individual that would be blurb-worthy.
However, I'm not sure that the Robert Redford discussion is the place for this conversation (which, by the way, I would Support Blurb; as, if you don't include him, who would you include?) but I'm not sure what the proper place to have it would be.
Wikipedia editors have different sensibilities.
To some, it seems that "old man dies" is never news, but I can't tell you how many notable deaths I've learned about by coming to this page (and I started coming to the proposals page (and even occasionally contributing to it) instead of the main page because a lot of people get left off of the main page).
The purpose of an encyclopedia and of Wikipedia is to allow people to be informed, and including recent deaths and blurbing notable ones fulfills this purpose by allowing people to be informed.
I think we could also discuss other criteria for notability.
Is it necessary to blurb the recurring champions of every sport, including a regional dart-throwing championship, for example?
A change in head of state is significant, in principle, but is it necessary to include a change in the prime minister of Tuvalu, with a population of less than 10,000?
We have Recent Deaths for those not deemed sufficiently blurb-worthy, but not anything similar for other news items.
Again, I know it's not really the place for this discussion (but thank you for reading my thoughts if you have), but I think it would be advantageous to have it.
Perhaps someone could suggest the best place for it.Ryan Reeder (talk) 01:00, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
This and other discussions of how to reform ITN are best held at the talk page. Natg 19 (talk) 02:16, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Additionally, some of your criteria questions are because those are listed at WP:ITNR which means that they have an "automatic" pass on notability. Some of those may need to be revised, however. Natg 19 (talk) 02:19, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support blurb based on his tangible impact on the film industry, his enduring fame, and the fact that he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom. That Legacy section is impressive. QuicoleJR (talk) 20:31, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support RD; oppose blurb – Per Humbledaisy. Arguments based on his accolades are not entirely convincing as it's somewhat expected that a high-profile actor will receive a medal or two at some point; what matters is Redford being "transformative" within his field. Not exactly a household name in the 2020s either. Nice4What (talk · contribs) – (Thanks ♥) 21:21, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Nice4What: Redford was transformative in the film industry as the founder of the Sundance Institute, whose Sundance Film Festival played a key role in the rise of indie films. QuicoleJR (talk) 21:35, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
He is one of three founders of that festival (the most high profile name of the three), so I don't think we can really call him transformative by association. The reason we are considering him for a blurb is surely about acting and I don't think we've established that he was a transformative actor. Humbledaisy (talk) 22:14, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support blurb Iconic actor worldwide. Seeing the list above convinces me that we should blurb him. It is OK to have a healthy number of blurbed deaths to balance all the sports news and the accidents news. I would argue that iconic peoples bios are more encyclopedic than minor sports or random accidents. Tradediatalk 21:51, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Strongly oppose blurb OLDMANDIES. Transformative underwater basket weaver. Manner of death not notable, and death not an event. Not even front-page "news" in most places in the US This post was made by orbitalbuzzsaw gang (talk) 08:08, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Is it your intention to contribute to death-blurb discussion in a meaningful way, or merely to disrupt them? OLDMANDIES and 'underwater basket weaver' tell us about as much about the merits of the case as 'bus plunge' does about an arbitrarily selected public transport accident. There is still no requirement either for the manner of death to be notable, nor for the death to be treated as a discrete event in itself. Only your last point is even relevant in principle, but unfortunately it's wrong - Redford's death made front page news here in the UK, for example. GenevieveDEon (talk) 09:04, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Agree with GenevievDEon completely. I ask for an admin to look into this disruptive pattern of !voting. I have previously commented here that these predictable !votes fall into the category of WP:DISRUPT and feel the time has come to issue strong warnings, and if continued, sanctions. Enough is enough.

I have to agree with the IP here: there is nothing disruptive in !voting like this. WP:IDONTLIKEIT is no reason to threaten someone with ANI or some form of action. There is absolutely nothing disruptive about this vote, despite some people being triggered by seeing a minority viewpoint being expressed. - SchroCat (talk) 05:21, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The problem is that this is a frequent statement by this editor, and completely ignores the written guidance we have for RD Blurb selection. One can complain that Redford wasn't a major figure and their death was not the news story, and there may be disagreement about that but that's a legit argument. But to claim the only reason to post an RD blurb is that the death must be notable, ignoring that the other options exist, is disruptive. It also doesn't help with the weak insult of a person still covered by BLP. If the editor wants to remove that "major figure" or "life as the story" aspects we have for RD Blurbs, the way to push that is on the ITN talk page, but while it exists, their arguments should reflect what the guidelines say. Masem (t) 12:01, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Still nothing in the comment is indicative of an ANI report. I disagree with Orbitalbuzzsaw's rationales though the point of death as an event stands and notability discussions for death blurbs for entertainment/sports personalities will always be in flux. We also need to be better with ITN deaths, the current criteria barely exists and most blurbs as such are ad hoc. At least Orbitalbuzzsaw has consistency going for them.

Needs work Level-5 vital and about 3 million readers on the news, making it the top read article yesterday.
But it's lacking some key details about the subject as a person.

@Andrew Davidson:, @EF5: & @GenevieveDEon:: Expanded the legacy & reception section by adding his status as a sex symbol and Redford's response to the label.

There was already mention of his owing the Sundance ski resort. —Bagumba (talk) 19:41, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Weak support blurb in principle, but wait until the issues described by Andrew are addressed. Redford was a major household name and had a wider influence on the artform and industry from behind the camera, which is exactly the sort of thing we should consider influential in making these determinations, in my opinion. GenevieveDEon (talk) 09:04, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Posted blurb. You guys know me, I'm very often opposed to routine deaths of household names without demonstration of further notability... but looking at this with my admin hat on rather than as a contributor, I see a very clear consensus to blurb this one, with arguments of those arguing he was one of the top figures of the film industry in his time. I've also noted the "needs work" comments above, but I think there's also a broad consensus that this meets the minimum threshold for inclusion within ITN, as also hinted at in Masem's assessment above. Sure, it's not GA or FA level, and some prose on "his handsome appearance and charm which made him a sex symbol" (perhaps not in that language though?!) as well as his skiing hobbies would be good additions, but aren't fundamental to having a vaguely complete article.  — Amakuru (talk) 14:46, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose blurb per those above. EF5 14:49, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
There are literally no arguments based on Wikipedia rules in the whole discussion. Not being household name (he was though), not being household name in 2020s, other actors being more famous, OLDMANDIES are not valid arguments when determining the person deserving blurb.

Oppose blurb, So many other stories get shut down even when they have massive news coverage, other past blurbs like the Charlie Kirk killing still have more coverage then Redford's death. Also he wasn't even a "household name" for most people in the US let alone the world Normalman101 (talk) 20:47, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
We don't use the size of the coverage or aspects like fame or "household name" as part of significance considerations, as we are not a newspaper nor a news ticker. Masem (t) 12:02, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Exactly, someone dying at a normal stage of life whose peak influence was decades ago does not warrent encyclopedic coverage. It feels like news stories tick by ITN too fast due to blurbs like this. I don't really have a problem with most of the individual nominations, however even while trying to contribute to ITN the volume of these drown out what is "In the News" IMO. Normalman101 (talk) 14:05, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

People usually complain that the stories tick by too slowly... you can't win I guess.  — Amakuru (talk) 16:32, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
He wasn't a household name? My recollection is that he was pretty much THE biggest household name, for movie actors of his generation, back in the 1970s, @Normalman101. Another would have been Paul Newman. For TV there was Alan Alda. Though after 50 years, my recollections may not be perfect. Nfitz (talk) 22:17, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
This is simply what I have gathered and experienced, again seemingly enough people thought he was deserving of a blurb so who am I to stand in the way. Personally I find several others of the time period to be more well known, (someone above put a lot of names, most of which I knew better), but in the end it's just personal expeience. Normalman101 (talk) 18:23, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Alan Alda wasn't / isn't a household name anywhere outside North America; I think "household name" is such a such a subjective thing and there are so many people we'd consider household names who are famous only nationally. Humbledaisy (talk) 18:52, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Comment A bit divided over this, giant film star but as Humbledaisy notes so are many others on a similar scale (we have rejected other equally well known names which I needn't list for any of the ITN regulars here). The transformative criteria will then have to stem from a career beyond cinema but I don't find the involvement with Sundance to be that major a factor to satisfy that. So, while I am not entirely opposed to the blurb, the rationales provided mostly focus on the acting career and not on the transformative criteria we have set up. Though I guess we need to flesh out what 'transformative' even means for us further and more exactly. Gotitbro (talk) 14:03, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Support alt1 (though switch to present tense). Whether the war in Gaza constitutes a genocide has been controversial and different bodies have made different assessments. This is the closest we're ever going to get to an 'official' determination. Genocide is enormously important and recognition of one certainly merits posting as an ITN blurb, in addition to the war itself being in the ongoing section. The article is an example of our best work, very well referenced and has been carefully updated. Modest Genius talk 13:37, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Modest Genius What about the ICJ case (albeit it’ll likely be a while before the ruling is even formulated, let alone released)? The Kip (contribs) 13:41, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I am not an expert on international law, but as I understand it the ICJ is responsible for determining whether a specific person is guilty of the crime of genocide, not the broader issue of whether a genocide occurred at all. The ICJ will likely take years or decades to bring anyone to trial (if it ever happens). For example, it was clear in the late 90s that there had been a genocide in Bosnia, but it took until 2016 for the ICJ to convict Karadžić of the crime, and the ICJ's own determination was of a much narrower legal sense that excluded many aspects of the conflict. So while an ICJ conviction would be big news in itself, I don't think it's the determining factor of whether genocide occurred. As an analogy: if someone is murdered, we don't wait years for a court conviction of the specific murderer before reporting that the death was a murder. Modest Genius talk 14:10, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Modest Genius I believe what you’re defining is the ICC, not the ICJ - the ICC prosecutes individuals, the ICJ nation-states. The Kip (contribs) 14:28, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
You're right, I mixed up the courts. For Bosnia, the relevant ICJ case was in 2007 - still more than a decade after the events. So I don't think that difference fundamentally changes the reasoning. Modest Genius talk 14:50, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Question of how binding this is or what actions this triggers. With the UN declaration of famine, that seemed to establish the need for more humanitarian programs to Gaza. This is a report by a three person panel and doesn't seem to have any immediate impact or even confirmation by the UN as a whole, so it seems less significant at this point.

The Gaza genocide article has significant verifiability issues. -- mikeblas (talk) 14:25, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Mikeblas: This was a false-positive error and due to usage of {{invoke}} for short inline references.
See the response in your topic: Talk:Gaza_genocide#missing_citations
Unless you have other concerns, can you please strike down your assertion? Bogazicili (talk) 19:01, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Verifiability concerns remain. Dozens of footnotes show warnings for footnotes that don't have matching citations. There's no realistic way to tell which of those are false alarms and which are not, other than manually visiting each. Indeed, the use of {{invoke}} seems to cause false alarms in the code that indicates a footnote has no target. The use of {{invoke}} is required because the Wiki markup parser has a limitation in the amount of text it can handle (or generate?). The article has gone through a wave of changing how it annotates its references and then uses this {{invoke}} trick, ignoring the problems it causes for verifiability.
That the workaround is necessary is a bug: an undesired limitation in functionality. The house of cards that implements -- templates, invoke, LUA scripts, code in the parser, ... -- is Byzantine and falls over easily when stressed. This is just one such article with problems.
Verifiability is one of the fundamental tenets of the encyclopedia, but the Wiki itself makes it extremely difficult to implement. The main page (and its sub features like "In the News") should not be used to showcase articles that are struggling with the parser implementation. Particularly for pages that cover sensitive and controversial subjects and must rely on easy verifiability to maintain balance and objectivity.
And so I reiterate my Strongly oppose not-vote. -- mikeblas (talk) 21:16, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Sounds like you're also quite serious about telling everyone that you're waiting for me, as you done here and a couple times on the article talk page.
I'm sorry that I'm not replying as fast as you'd like. I don't have the time to revise my not-vote every time you request me to do so, and as immediately as you're asking me to. Remember: it's not me that's the problem here: the issue is that the article exposes significant limitations in the referencing system and the wiki parser.
If you think the article is in better shape (and better yet: if there is consensus that the solution now is what to use going forward) then you should feel free to move forward. And you can do that without me revising my not-vote. Maybe focus on the other dozen or so oppose votes here.

Oppose: From the linked Reuters article (bolding by me): "The commission's 72-page legal analysis is the strongest U.N. finding to date but the body is independent and does not officially speak for the United Nations.

The altblurbs specify that it is an independent commission, not the UN as a whole.
–DMartin 22:03, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I Support the Alt1 blurb as concise and accurate. This has been all over the world's main news outlets and is the news lede [5] for the BBC's "flagship international news and current affairs radio programme" Newshour (for example). The other similar determinations made for instance by B'Tselem, Amnesty International, and the Médecins Sans Frontières only give further weight to the UN Commission's determination; this assessment is reflected in the editorial decisions of global newspapers to highlight their findings on their front pages. Our decision should disregard clearly false arguments that the report fails WP:ITNSIGNIF (belied by international reporting) or that the article has WP:V arguments, already resolved on the talk page. -Darouet (talk) 18:10, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
You seem to fail to get what WP:ITNSIGNIF is about. International reporting is Necessary But Not Sufficient, a story also needs consensus. Many people have pointed that, although the blurb may suggest otherwise to the unaware reader, this body is not the UN nor what it says is an official UN view on the topic.
If you want to change that, you should explain if we got it wrong somehow and this Commission is really the big deal you seem to think it is. Cambalachero (talk) 18:47, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I'm glad you brought this up. The language of Alt1 is identical to that of the most reputable news organizations. The BBC states, "a UN investigation has concluded that Israel has committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza."[6] Compare that to Alt1: "A UN Commission of Inquiry has concluded Israel has committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza." I agree with you that an editor could be, personally, confused about what that means. But the UN investigation's findings are consistent with determinations of most international and Israeli human rights organizations, which are remarkably unified in their consensus. -Darouet (talk) 19:01, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support. Prefer alt1. The report was titled: "Legal analysis of the conduct of Israel in Gaza pursuant to the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide" [7] The inquiry was headed by Navi Pillay [8], president of International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda relevant to Rwandan genocide. I don't know what does not officially speak for the United Nations means. UN is composed of different countries. Some UN bodies or officials may refrain until an official ICJ ruling in several years. But I don't think that's a reason to omit this from the news. Alt1 says A UN Commission of Inquiry, it doesn't say "The UN". So I am not sure where the confusion is in. Bogazicili (talk) 19:35, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Comment: I have just tagged the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory article for lack of NPOV, and explained it at the talk page.

Support Significant event, comparable to the statements of the International Commission of Inquiry on Darfur. All linked articles are of good quality.
–DMartin 22:06, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Comment Is there a good illustrative image for this entry?
Maybe something like c:File:An UNRWA school which turned into a shelter in Deir el-Balah, Gaza Strip.jpg.
–DMartin 22:19, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
It is distressing but I think something like this [9], which appears in Al-Farabi School Bombing, would be illustrative, but sad. -Darouet (talk) 00:45, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support, clearly significant development that exceeds the ongoing Morgan695 (talk) 23:23, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I lean towards oppose for now. This is an independent investigation body from the UN. Unlike the famine blurb, with the IPC more directly affiliated with the UN, this is still a separate commission and the UN had not officially declared the conflict as a "genocide" as such. When the UN accept the findings, then it would be more significant.--ZKang123 (talk · contribs) 10:41, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose Independent commission that notably does not speak for the UN, nor does it claim to, makes claim regarding a war that several others agencies have already made. This feels more like an attempt to right a great wrong or be a WikiActivist. Not notable enough on its own; falls under ongoing regardless. Cheers, atque supra! Fakescientist8000 14:10, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose on quality. While I disagree with the article's orange tag (since the given sources claimed to be selectively used give relatively little prominence to the Israeli criticism and more would be WP:UNDUE), the article still mostly just presents the commission's reports (and briefly discusses criticism by Israel and the US), without much about the context, how the commission operates, its relationship with the UN, etc. Chaotic Enby (talk · contribs) 14:25, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I presume you are referring to the article on the commission? The altblurbs only bold link Gaza genocide, which seems in excellent shape. If you don't like the other bold link, would you support alt1? Modest Genius talk 15:20, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
My bad, didn't catch that the altblurbs changed the bolded links. In that case, weak support the altblurbs, as, despite being covered by ongoing, the results of the fact-finding mission still rise above the higher significance threshold. Chaotic Enby (talk · contribs) 17:22, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
While civilian casualties are common in war, it is abundantly clear that is not what is happening here. I'm honestly not sure about this nomination specifically, but continuing to sweep up all of what is happening into the heading of "Gaza War" seems to be carrying water for Israel. Hamas military engagement is a rather trivial component of the ongoing crisis. GreatCaesarsGhost 15:12, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
A trivial component of news coverage, perhaps, but a significant component of why the war continues. If Hamas were to release the hostages, that would merit an ITN nomination. Coining (talk) 18:12, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
That's specious CRYSTALBALLism, but in any case irrelevant. I'm not talking about news coverage or "why the war continues" but the actual course of events that we are attempting to document. Israel is conducting a genocide in Gaza, and unilateral attacks in Gaza, the West Bank, and several other countries, but the war part (i.e. multilateral conflict with an armed adversary) is a small part of the overall conflict. GreatCaesarsGhost 13:38, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
To be fair to Hamas, the Gaza strip is the only place they can fight. Hawkeye7 (discuss) 04:26, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Except that none of this would have happened if Hamas hadn't fought/attacked/slaughtered outside of Gaza on October 7. Cognizant though of WP:NOTAFORUM, I'll refrain from commenting on the appropriateness of being fair to Hamas. Coining (talk) 15:50, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
If you thought enough to be cognizant of NOTAFORUM, then you should erase the forum comment. Everyone understands the incursion 23 months ago is the pretense Israel is using for its current activities in Gaza, the West Bank, the UAE, etc. The point is that by considering any action by Israel to be a continuum of those events indefinitely, we are tacitly endorsing the Israeli argument that they are forever "responding" rather than acting as the aggressor. GreatCaesarsGhost 19:56, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose No one is waiting for the UN to know that a genocide is happening. Tradediatalk 01:49, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Strong Support Result of long investigation by UN Human Rights Council that includes official calls for action and that resulted in calls from at least 20 other major aid organizations.  selfwormTalk) 03:38, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose As much as it pains me to say it, this is unfortunately a situation where "in other news, water is wet" applies. There has been a fairly longstanding consensus amongst the world's authorities and scholars on human rights and genocide studies that this was the case. One additional UN commission adding its voice to that consensus is notable and merits coverage on Wikipedia, but at the same time, it is not so independently newsworthy as to escape the fact that this is otherwise captured by ongoing. FlipandFlopped ㋡ 03:53, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose Gaza War is already in the ongoing. Hawkeye7 (discuss) 04:26, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Question at what point does this become something that could be in the "Ongoing" with Patel saying it will "extend for years"[1] so is there a set amount of time it has to be to going on for?
Otto (talk) 15:17, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
It can be posted as blurb and then as Ongoing. ArionStar (talk) 15:30, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Wait/Oppose Borrowing the words of Masem from the previous time this happened:
If this wasn't a cartel vessel and turns out the US hit a civilian ship, as to start a larger conflict, that might be a reason to post, but there's no indication that anything has been massively escalated due to this. Currently, I feel this lacks any impact to post. 5.57.242.223 (talk) 15:38, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Note that Venezuela did assert the last boat was all civilians, but as yet nothing has really come this. Masem (t) 15:42, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
It provoked the reaction of several countries. ArionStar (talk) 15:50, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I just noticed 2025 US Caribbean naval deployment is the target article for this blurb. Wouldn't 2025 United States strikes on Venezuelan boats be a better target article seeing how the article focuses on the strikes themselves rather than just describing them in passing like 2025 US Caribbean naval deployment does? Feel free to append to my previous !vote if that's more appropriate 5.57.242.223 (talk) 16:39, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose Wait, too early. Given what we know at this point, it is only a drug dealing police operation. Therefore, not yet notable at the level of an ITN. Tradediatalk 01:18, 18 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose The event is barely covered let alone being notable enough to be on the news.
Rager7 (talk) 05:44, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose Sorry, we are not a WP:TRUMPTICKER. Barely anymore notable than the last [illegal] stirke on the Venezuelan boat which was smilarly rejected. Unless these lead to substantial developments (relations, operations etc.), we'll stay put. Gotitbro (talk) 12:26, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
