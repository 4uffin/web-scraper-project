This page provides a place to discuss new items for inclusion on In the news (ITN), a protected template on the Main Page (see past items in the ITN archives). Do not report errors in ITN items that are already on the Main Page here— discuss those at the relevant section of WP:ERRORS.
This candidates page is integrated with the daily pages of Portal:Current events. A light green header appears under each daily section – it includes transcluded Portal:Current events items for that day. You can discuss ITN candidates under the header.

Typhoon Ragasa (satellite image shown) affects Taiwan and the Philippines, leaving at least 25 people dead.

Glossary[edit]
Blurbs are one-sentence summaries of the news story.
Altblurbs, labelled alt1, alt2, etc., are alternative suggestions to cover the same story.
A target article, bolded in text, is the focus of the story. Each blurb must have at least one such article, but you may also link non-target articles.
Articles in the Ongoing line describe events getting continuous coverage.
The Recent deaths (RD) line includes any living thing whose death was recently announced. Consensus may decide to create a blurb for a recent death.
All articles linked in the ITN template must pass our standards of review. They should be up-to-date, demonstrate relevance via good sourcing and have at least an acceptable quality.
Nomination steps[edit]
Make sure the item you want to nominate has an article that meets our minimum requirements and contains reliable coverage of a current event you want to create a blurb about. We will not post about events described in an article that fails our quality standards.
Find the correct section below for the date of the event (not the date nominated). Do not add sections for new dates manually – a bot does that for us each day at midnight (UTC).
Create a level 4 header with the article name (==== Your article here ====). Add (RD) or (Ongoing) if appropriate.
Then paste the {{ITN candidate}} template with its parameters and fill them in. The news source should be reliable, support your nomination and be in the article. Write your blurb in simple present tense. Below the template, briefly explain why we should post that event. After that, save your edit. Your nomination is ready!
You may add {{ITN note}} to the target article's talk page to let editors know about your nomination.
The better your article's quality, the better it covers the event and the wider its perceived significance (see WP:ITNSIGNIF for details), the better your chances of getting the blurb posted.

Headers[edit]
When the article is ready, updated and there is consensus to post, you can mark the item as (Ready). Remove that wording if you feel the article fails any of these necessary criteria.
Admins should always separately verify whether these criteria are met before posting blurbs marked (Ready). For more guidance, check WP:ITN/A.
If satisfied, change the header to (Posted).
Where there is no consensus, or the article's quality remains poor, change the header to (Closed) or (Not posted).
Sometimes, editors ask to retract an already-posted nomination because of a fundamental error or because consensus changed. If you feel the community supports this, remove the item and mark the item as (Pulled).
Voicing an opinion on an item[edit]
Format your comment to contain "support" or "oppose", and include a rationale for your choice. In particular, address the notability of the event, the quality of the article, and whether it has been updated.
Please do...[edit]
ShortcutWP:ITNCDOWP:ITNCDO
Pick an older item to review near the bottom of this page, before the eligibility runs out and the item scrolls off the page and gets abandoned in the archive, unused and forgotten.
Review an item even if it has already been reviewed by another user. You may be the first to spot a problem, or the first to confirm that an identified problem was fixed. Piling on the list of "support!" votes will help administrators see what is ready to be posted on the Main Page.
Tell about problems in articles if you see them. Be bold and fix them yourself if you know how, or tell others if it's not possible.
Please do not...[edit]
ShortcutWP:ITNCDONTWP:ITNCDONT
Add simple "support!" or "oppose!" votes without including your reasons. Similarly, curt replies such as "who?", "meh", or "duh!" are not helpful. A vote without reasoning means little for us, please elaborate yourself.
Oppose an item just because the event is only relating to a single country, or failing to relate to one. We post a lot of such content, so these comments are generally unproductive.
Accuse other editors of supporting, opposing or nominating due to a personal bias (such as ethnocentrism). We at ITN do not handle conflicts of interest.
Comment on a story without first reading the relevant article(s).
Oppose a recurring item here because you disagree with the recurring items criteria. Discuss them here.
Use ITN as a forum for your own political or personal beliefs. Such comments are irrelevant to the outcome and are potentially disruptive.
Suggesting updates[edit]
There are two places where you can request corrections to posted items:
Anything that does not change the intent of the blurb (spelling, grammar, markup issues, updating death tolls etc.) should be discussed at WP:Errors.
Discuss major changes in the blurb's intent or very complex updates as part of the current ITNC nomination.

Support RD, Oppose Blurb: Article is fine enough, though some more in-line citations could be used in the larger paragraphs. Oppose blurb on principle.--The Robot Parade (talk) 18:17, 25 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
What does "on principle" mean? There is precedent for "major figures" to be blurbed, though who qualifies for this is heavily debated. Natg 19 (talk) 18:44, 25 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose RD on quality. Particularly some priority of info and reorg is needed, as appearing on a game show doesn't seem that much of an achievement to be in the second lede sentence. But obvious support the RD when fixed. Oppose blurb as the articles gives little reason to how he alone was a major figure. Simply being a laureate isn't sufficient, and while is research did help, there's nothing to consider that very transformative. Most of the impact are based on topics that benefitted from research, downstream, and not his work directly. Masem (t) 18:31, 25 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Support in principle, but the article is not ready. There's a brief update saying he was convicted, but the rest of the article is still in future tense, the lead refers to the outcome of a separate 2021 case not the 2025 one, there's no reaction to the outcome etc. This only just happened - we shouldn't rush to post an article that isn't ready yet. I expect it can be brought into decent shape in the next few hours. I've added an alt2 blurb - 'convicted to' doesn't make sense. Modest Genius talk 12:51, 25 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Wait, lean support on notability We have historically posted other storms with comparable death tolls under 100: e.g. Cyclone Michaung, Typhoon Goni or Typhoon Meranti. However, the true scale and scope of Ragasa remains unclear. I lean towards support, but would prefer to wait until the full scope of the casualties as well as the impact on mainland China (particularly Hong Kong) becomes more clear. If on the other hand the current death toll/scale of impact does not rise and it remains fixed in terms of casualties and damages, it might be more comparable to Typhoon Lan for example, which we did not post.
FlipandFlopped ㋡ 02:27, 24 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Wait Similar to previous comment. Wait until it hits Hong Kong/Mainland China. As it stands, it's not super notable. If/when it hits Hong Kong/Mainland China, happy to support with associated areas added to the blurb. Basetornado (talk) 06:28, 24 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Wait but leaning towards support As the creator of the article, thank you for nominating this article, which I believe was because of the increasingly dire situation in Hualien County (which you mentioned), with at least 14 fatalities and 100+ missing as of this writing. The Philippines (my country) also suffered a beating from the most intense tropical cyclone of the year (so far); widespread damage has been reported in Northern Luzon. But for now, I think we should wait just a little bit to also take account Ragasa's effects in Mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau. The storm surge (as seen in videos from earlier today) has been significant, flooding several areas of HK and Macao; wouldn't be surprised if that would also be the case for other parts of South China, particularly Guangdong and quite possibly, Hainan. Vida0007 (talk) 09:31, 24 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Wait, lean support Very likely to be an important ITN item if it makes landfall at high intensity in Mainland China, Taiwan or any other densely populated island nearby. That said, tropical cyclones are an increasingly common event across the Pacific every year, and several in the past few years have not made ITN on the basis that they have been insufficiently newsworthy for lacking significant casualties/damage, having low intensity or not making landfall in particular. Given roughly half of all cyclones do not result in any casualties at all and many of a lower intensity over open water go will entirely undetected, I am reluctant to quantify exactly what level of damage would make a cyclone suitable for ITN, but I do believe this one has caused enough to warrant ITN, given it made landfall on Panuitan Island in the Philippines already. I also note the blurb will invariably need updating prior to appearing in ITN as the infobox in the article itself already lists 28+ fatalities and 102+ injuries. Oppius Brutus 10:06, 24 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Wait on quality, then Support. The Pearl River Delta luckily has avoided the worst of Ragasa, but the impacts for Taiwan (especially Hualien County), Hong Kong, and Macau need to be expanded upon in my opinion, if possible. Otherwise, Ragasa's death toll has unfortunately reached at least 25 and seems likely to rise; we additionally have impacts pending for Guangdong and possibly further inland regions of China. ArkHyena (she/they) 10:11, 24 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Oppose - ITN has routinely demonstrated that even death counts as high as 30 with weather events aren't significant enough to blurb. Strong typhoon, but there's been numerous outlandish weather events that haven't been blurbed. No comment n the impacts; I'd like to at least wait till it's dissipated and the damage is solidified. EF5 15:00, 24 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose - Oh no, it's raining again Nfitz (talk) 22:15, 24 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support currently over 20 deaths and 170 injuries with several dozen missing, and it still has more time as it travels towards Laos to cause more (though obviously has weakened). I know we don't want to post small scale weather events that leave small death tolls, nor routine weather issues that often kill many over a long duration of time (like floods in Asia) but this is reported to be the strongest storm recorded this year and the toll is already significant can't for a single event. Masem (t) 23:06, 24 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
20 deaths in an Asian rainstorm is significant? That wasn't even local news when I used live there, when it wasn't even much more than the usual evening rain storm! Nfitz (talk) 05:54, 25 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
This wasn't any common "rainstorm". It was a major typhoon / hurricane with damage to low lying regions. And where did you live where 20 deaths due to rain is the norm? Natg 19 (talk) 06:41, 25 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support on notability, per many above; this more than clears the bar for a notable typhoon in my eyes, with its existing impacts already being high and possibly worsening in time. @EF5: in response to your comment, I want to bring up that !votes based on others are generally seen as "what about X" and two items that seem clearly identical on notability to some can be seen entirely different to others. Departure– (talk) 23:27, 24 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The entire essay WAX is embedded in is one I usually ignore when brought up, as it’s (obviously) an essay and has some terrible takes. Trust me, I would love to have more weather events at ITN, including this, but prior precedent (argh) has established that weather events need to be high-impact. EF5 23:36, 24 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Precedent doesn't exist on ITN, as someone who's been here well over a year. I personally vote for events based on my standards of notability, past precedent be damned (usually), and I think that's the best way for anyone else to !vote - remember, ignore all rules if it means getting an event you think should be posted, posted. Departure– (talk) 23:40, 24 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

The article is a GA and seems fine. Andrew🐉(talk) 22:12, 23 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose blurb only due to lack of clarity of why she was a great figure, beyond the brief lede discussion. This is where there absolutely needs a legacy or impact section to summarize those and what's likely coming in from obits. Note that I am not dismissing any claims she might be a great figure but the article does not give a good convincing reason absent a significant section on this, which should be possible with sourcing from what I'm seeing (Andrews comparison to Redford is apt, but redford's article had such a section). Support RD as no quality issues. Masem (t) 22:23, 23 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Neutral on blurb. Based on "have I heard of her", I would vote oppose blurb, but unsure of her legacy. Seems like she left Hollywood in the late 60s, but not sure on her influence on Italian cinema. Looks well cited, so support RD. Natg 19 (talk) 00:34, 24 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support RD, oppose blurb because I'm not seeing the same amount of impact as Redford. She doesn't even have a legacy section. I could be convinced to change my mind, but I don't think she is important enough for a blurb. She seems closer to Terence Stamp than Redford. Like Masem, I could probably be convinced to change my vote by a well-written Legacy section. However, the quality is sufficient for RD. QuicoleJR (talk) 00:38, 24 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

There is no significant sourced info that illustrates why they are great figures, and instead we're seeing editors handwavinhband using OR to establish this, like number of films or recordings or awards. If there was at least significant sourcing, as there was for Redford, that's a far better start to duscuss if someone was a major influence. Personally I'd prefer that to be in a legacy or impact section but that's not required as long as the sourcing is there directly supporting the major figure idea. Masem (t) 16:49, 24 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

"Influential" and "transformative" are not synonyms.
If we posted a blurb for every person that was "influential" in their field we'd be posting a lot more than we do now.
For example, if "influential" was the definition I could make a case for Nicholas Grimshaw which is currently at RD and I'm sure there are many more that I'm not familiar with that could hit the same criteria. Black Kite (talk) 18:09, 24 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Could she at least be placed longer at RD?: She was placed last in that list for some reason and is now already removed from RD. I'm sort of neutral on a blurb. I don't view her as quite as influental/transformative as Brigitte Bardot or Sophia Loren are, but she was a hugely famous star and it could be compensation for missing Delon last year. --Clibenfoart (talk) 08:42, 25 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I noticed that too and rolled my eyes.
The good news is that it doesn't matter much because no-one pays much attention to RD.
Cardinale got lots of views yesterday making her one of the top read articles.
ITN had little to do with that as she got about four times the readership of Redford even though his picture continued to hog the limelight, giving him a run of an entire week!
ITN makes it clear that famous men are fine but famous women are an "error".
Who's making this call – why it's men, of course. Andrew🐉(talk) 09:53, 25 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I readded her. Two things happened is that after her RD was posted, another admin then mass added 5 more RDs after her, and also removed a 7th name from the list (as to put her last) due to the length of the RD line with those names. With the next more recent addition, that admin just did the usual "add top, roll off bottom" method that took her off. As the RD line is now taking 3 lines with just the current six names, there's plenty of room to add her back on.
Honest, we need to have better practice that assures an RD stays on the RD for at least 24hr, if that means pausing the addition of new RDs or trying to only add RD in daily batches (ala DYK). Masem (t) 12:07, 25 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Oppose on quality. In principle a new constitution is significant enough for ITN, but the article is very bare bones. There are only two sentences explaining how the new constitution differs from the old one. What little text is in the article hints vaguely at boycotts, protests and unfair practices, but provides very little information on any of those. Readers are left with no idea of why the changes were being introduced, who did or didn't support them, what issues were, whether the vote was fair etc. The results in the table, text and infobox are inconsistent.

Article needs updatingNominator's comments: We did post his arrest and detainment at ICC back in March 2025.

Oppose. We posted his arrest, and can do so if he's convicted. It's not necessary to blurb every legal step along the way. This isn't even the formal charging, it's the release of the supporting documents that justify the charge. Modest Genius talk 14:24, 23 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
As a point of order, this is a case where the charges were not publicly reported by the ICC nor the media when they were made, in which case this would not be stale, in comparison to the hypothetical case where the ICC did report the charges in July but no news sources reported on them until now, which I would agree would make it stake. Masem (t) 20:31, 23 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Yes, I understood that the news of the exact charges isn't stale. I wasn't suggesting otherwise. My point is that this news is less impactful than it might first appear. The story isn't disqualified as stale, it just doesn't reach sufficiently high impact to justify an ITN blurb IMO. Modest Genius talk 14:35, 24 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Oppose My initial impulse was to support, but I think Andrew and Modest Genius have it right here. It was sort of implicit in his arrest that he would later be charged. In my mind, they are functionally the same news item; this is just a procedural development flowing from the initial story that the ICC is pursuing a case against him, which we have in effect already posted. I would support later posting the results of his trial, if or when it occurs. FlipandFlopped ㋡ 00:57, 24 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose So, the indictment had already happened. Any later press release as such then is unsubstantial (and this may indeed be considered stale). On a general note, the Trump ITN postings did set up a bad BLPCRIME vio precedent. Even though convictions are ideally the only thing we should be posting, I can understand posting ICC arrest warrants as they receive head to head headline coverage but we shouldn't be going beyond those except for convictions.

Oppose blurb – Not necessarily on significance (I wouldn't be an expert on this), but because the article is not of sufficient quality or depth to be a full front-page feature. In particular, the death is only described in a single short sentence, while this should really at least be a paragraph for a blurb. There is no information post-2016!

Oppose Just more Trump bluster (WP:NTRUMP) as the U.S. literally has no mechanisms for designating domestic groups as terrorist.

Oppose as experts have pointed out, there is no actual anyifa organization and the legal ability to declare anything as a domestic terrorism group has no basis in law. There may be longer term impacts as it is expected this will be used to illegally imprison dissentent voices but until that actually happens it's just a claim without any teeth. Masem (t) 15:33, 23 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose: as pointed, this is just a "Trump says..." news, and not the actual process used to designate organizations as terrorists. As far as the law is concerned, Antifa is not a terrorist organization. And the link to United States Department of State list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations seems to be inaccurate: to be listed there an organization must be a foreign one. I'm not sure which is the US process to designate national organizations as terrorists, but surely it is somewhere else. Also, I wouldn't bold the "executive order" article: it's just a redirect to List of executive orders in the second Trump presidency, and there it is just an entry in a table with zero context.

Wait We realistically cannot post every protest that happens around the world which remains otherwise peaceful (there were a small number of arrests and injuries in the trillion peso march but given the numbers est. to be >100k, that's trivial) or without an immediate impact (like in Nepal). The protests are not over so more could happen in the next few days. Masem (t) 14:33, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
At least 150,000 protestors as a joint demonstration. It's news in every single newspaper. ArionStar (talk) 14:38, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
ITN's threshold for political demonstrations is somebody dying due to the protest (or probably storming the capitol, you gotta read the opposes on that LOL); nobody died here that we know of, and the worst that happened was rioters stealing a three-star hotel vault. Now if rioters storm the Batasang Pambansa Complex, that'll be something. Howard the Duck (talk) 14:33, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Oppose This may or may not be considered a part of the Asian Spring (nearly not as impactful as the outright revolutions in Nepal, Bangladesh and the massive protests in Indonesia) but this is not certainly not PPP 3.0, so I will hold my breath unless the Marcos government actually breaks. Gotitbro (talk) 17:56, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
In Metro Manila, there were actually two rallies, plus several other minor ones, then other ones elsewhere, but the articles should probably be merged into one. None of the major rally organizers were calling for the downfall of the Marcos government, as they judge that the one that will be replacing it will be worse for their interests. Also, everyone forgets about EDSA III. Howard the Duck (talk) 18:06, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
You mean the Estrada version of J6, I am sure no one in their right mind considers that a 'people power' revolution of any kind. Not a case of forgetting but a case of of sticking with facts. Gotitbro (talk) 22:08, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose 1 trillion PHP is about 17 billion USD. Routine anti-corruption protest in a flawed democracy. If the protestors win all of their demands, the impact will not be transformative to the Filipino government. Dr Fell (talk) 03:14, 22 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
"17 billion USD", we have posted scandals involving much less, the amount is irrelevant and nonetheless clearly siginificant for the Philipppines. We assess the merits of protests on the basis of wider national significance, immediate or otherwise, for ITN but that does not stem from value judgments of "flawed democracy". And this is certainly not a 'routine' corruption event, for e.g. the speaker of the house has resigned here and an entire commission has been set up for this.
But since this nom is about the protest itself and not the event as a whole, I oppose it on the grounds of that [protests] alone but that definitely is not a statement on the event we are dealing with here as a whole. Gotitbro (talk) 04:28, 22 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Wait I support posting the protest in general, however we should wait and see if there are any government changes, as seen in Nepal. NewishIdeas (talk) 06:43, 22 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Weak oppose. Marches or demonstrations with ~100k participants are not unusual in global terms - there's one today in Brazil, yesterday in Italy, a week ago in the UK etc. And those are only the ones I've seen headlines about, I didn't go hunting for them. ITN generally avoids posting stories about national politics. I'm not seeing anything about this particular protest to elevate it to blurb level. Still, I know almost nothing about Filipino politics, so perhaps I'm missing something. Modest Genius talk 16:50, 22 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Ever since Duterte became president, protesters have been vilified in the Philippines, with protesters being labeled as "communists" (so 20th century, I know) with possible lethal implications, that the only actual protesters have been actual overground communists. This changed this weekend as now the government allowed the protests. Howard the Duck (talk) 12:30, 23 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support Should be read and considered as the apex of a major government corruption scandal, not just as a demonstration. This is not one-off and has been brewing for months. Demonstration is common globally, and corruption has long been present in the Philippines, but demonstration at this scale against the Filipino political dynasties hasn't reached this scale in decades. 24.248.175.131 (talk) 00:27, 23 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Weak oppose per MG, though like him I also know little about Filipino politics, so I can probably be convinced otherwise. The Kip (contribs) 01:15, 23 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Oppose: I don' think that adding new entries to a table is enough updating of an article to count here. And also, this is the third time in less than a week that I see a weak proposal about something related to the Gaza War that is already ongoing. Cambalachero (talk) 14:21, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
As someone who’s voted against some of the other proposed items related to Gaza, the ongoing item existing doesn’t preclude us from posting a blurb if it’s judged to be of overt importance greater than simply the ongoing item. In my opinion, several major western powers recognizing a Palestinian state is one of those overly important items, and holds a wider relevance than just the war itself; keep in mind Gaza is only one part of the State of Palestine. The Kip (contribs) 00:32, 22 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose Not the first such countries, and until it actually means something (that the world will take some type of action to stop the war), mostly empty. As well as generally covered by the ongoing. Masem (t) 14:26, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Most of the State of Palestine, @Masem, is not Gaza. Gaza is only 365 km² while the West Bank is over 5,000 km². This is most certainly not covered by Ongoing! Nfitz (talk) 19:19, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose until it actually means something. Right now, it's a sovereign state without defined border, without a government and this is just politics. Until a real agreement is reached, like the Abraham Accords, this is just politics. Sir Joseph (talk) 15:18, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support altblurb1 – Noted to be "a historic diplomatic shift". Yes, many states have recognized Palestine before (quite obvious at this point), but there's no denying the diplomatic weight of these G20 countries' recognition. The US now remains the sole UNSC permanent member that opposes Palestinian statehood. This has been a months-long push for Western recognition that is widely covered in international news.

Of couse that it is "widely covered in international news". That's the bare minimum, I wouldn't expect any less. But there are dozens of such stories at any given moment and the template has a limited size, so "it's in the news right now" is not enough in itself. Cambalachero (talk) 15:33, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Wait until France and any others join in too, as this seems to be a loosely coordinated move.
Then see what the reactions are. Andrew🐉(talk) 15:36, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
France has now announced support. So that's Australia, UK, Canada, Portugal, Malta, and France (and Luxembourg and Monaco) in the last 2 days. Three of the seven G7 nations, and 4 of the 20 G20 nations. Nfitz (talk) 21:50, 22 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support but wait Reports indicate that ten countries are to recognize Palestine over the new two days. We should wait until the end of Monday before deciding until what the blurb entails. The reason I support it now is because it's a massive wave of recognition that involves heavy-hitter countries in terms of economic and military power,
going from precisely zero of the G7 countries recognizing Palestine to a small majority of 4, and pointedly shows Israel's growing international isolation given their long-term opposition to such a move. I don't get the people who oppose this by saying that this "just politics", especially the one user who negatively compared this to the Abraham Accords; that's literally what all international relations is. At this point, I'm convinced that there are some users who juat don't want Palestine to be discussed at all. Mount Patagonia (talk • contributions) 16:40, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support Alt1 but wait for French recognition since the initial blurb of "Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom" will be outdated very soon. Portugal will join those three before the day is over, France will join them tomorrow, and Andorra, Luxembourg, and Malta will join them this week. As Nice4What already explained, this is a major diplomatic shift.  Vanilla  Wizard

After some later, arguments, support ALT3 as well, but oppose ALT2. Indifferent to which of 1/3 gets used, but IMO, France is the only country worth mentioning given they generally led the charge here. The Kip (contribs) 21:54, 22 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support but oppose alt1 I think this event is significant, but for the altblurb I oppose the phrase "In an effort led by France". I've checked The Atlantic, NYT, WAPO, Politico, BBC, and Haaretz. The WAPO gets closest, saying it was in coordination with France, and the BBC notes that France was the first to announce their intention to recognize, but neither say the effort was led by France. 1brianm7 (talk) 17:40, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Here are some sources you might've missed:
Associated Press: France drives other nations to recognize Palestinian state
Politico: "France is leading the effort"
Washington Post: "The three nations became the biggest countries to recognize Palestine, acting in coordination with France..."
Bloomberg: "French President Emmanuel Macron has led the way on the plan to recognize Palestinian statehood"
Times of Israel: "The UK’s expected announcement on Sunday is part of a French-led initiative to recognize a State of Palestine"
Telegraph: "Mr Macron has spearheaded a movement among Western leaders to recognise Palestinian statehood, in opposition to the US. France became the first G7 nation to make this pledge in July."
French lobbying other Western states has been previously reported (see July 2025 Conference on the Implementation of the Two-State Solution § Planned recognition of Palestine). Nice4What (talk · contribs) – (Thanks ♥) 18:55, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Support Major development, clearly rises above the war (we would post such recognition for any other state). This is the fallout of the war and genocide, we cannot really bury our heads in the sand for absolutely major developments that stem from it. Comparing the recognition of an entire state to defence pacts (Abraham Accords) is very callous. Gotitbro (talk) 18:06, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support - huge story with UK, Canada, Australian recognition - this is the English Wikipedia after all. But where's France's recognition - I'm confused why I only see stuff such as today's interview with Macron, which talks about the timing of opening the French embassy in Palestine - but not the actual recognition. Nfitz (talk) 19:24, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
France is scheduled to formally announce recognition tomorrow. Additionally, while this is the English-language Wikipedia, it is an international project, and shouldn't give special weight to English-speaking countries when deciding what is or isn't in the news.

Is there a written policy on that @Chaotic Enby?

Which remains an essay, interpreting policy. Only pointing to the moribund WP:CSB. I think I'm yet to say BIAS in a discussion without getting a "what can we do if the (English/Western) sources themselves are biased" from someone. Still I think it's enough, as that's almost half the G7 right there, and surely the vast majority of the G20 by now. Nfitz (talk) 20:32, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Question I'm trying to find sources if this is the case, but given that the US was the sole veto of the g7 at the UN meeting on Friday to demand a ceasefire, is this major action a response to that? If so, that should be indicated in the blurb. But if not, the blurb needs to establish why these countries compared to the other 130 countries that recognize Palenstein statehood is that important (!voters are mentioning that but that should be more explicit) Masem (t) 19:44, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
This long precedes that vote (which sounds like so many). For example, @Masem, Canada announced their intent to do this in September both on September 15th and July 30th. Nfitz (talk) 19:48, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
then the blurb should establish why these 4 countries' recognition is a major turning point, which I think we can pull from sources. Masem (t) 19:52, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
These recognitions are the result of a conference in July – July 2025 Conference on the Implementation of the Two-State Solution. Andrew🐉(talk) 20:28, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Support this is 2/5ths of the permanent members of the security council recognizing Palestine as a state.
That's a huge move in the diplomatic world.
Palestine was previously recognized by Russia and China, so this moves Palestine from a minority of permanent security council members to a clear majority, with the United States as the lone opposer.
There's still great power holdouts like Germany, Italy, and Japan, but overall this movement is significant and significant enough for ITN. NorthernFalcon (talk) 21:43, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

There have been arguements put forth here and at related pages, that only a rubber stamping in the affirmative by countries like the US and Germany can make us assess the international consensus of what is happening.

I’m not quite sure how that addresses my initial concern, and I still recommend you strike it. It’s a comment on politics, not on content. The Kip (contribs) 14:09, 22 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Comments may cover politics but still not be forum content. Let me elaborate. A recognition by major countries, barring those directly supporting one side in the conflict/genocide, is significant in and of itself and what those conflict of interest holdouts make of this recognition really has nobearing for deciding the ITN significance of this nom.

Needs work Looking at this after a day, our article and its meagre update seems quite inadequate to reflect coverage and reaction such as:
Israeli political sphere unanimous in opposing Palestinian state recognition ... Israel must not annex West Bank in response to recognition, says Cooper – the BBC's live coverage of reactions and responses
Recognising Palestinian statehood opens another question - who would lead it? ― a good in-depth analysis considering such criteria as the Montevideo Convention
Europe Talks Big on Gaza but Struggles to Act – the NYT points out that Europe seems quite divided and ineffectual
Perhaps there's a timeline or some other article which has more but currently the proposed target doesn't give the reader much detail about current developments.

Today, I see that Trump will be speaking at the UN and I suppose he may take a different tack.

Trump's speech is just the start.
This is the General debate of the eightieth session of the United Nations General Assembly and the leader of every country is going to make a speech over the next week!
I'm not optimistic that any of these announcements and speeches will change anything but let's see shall we... Andrew🐉(talk) 17:34, 23 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
With 20 editors already in "support" and much less voting "oppose", I'm unsure if your personal desire to wait for world leaders' yearly speeches should override the already apparent consensus to post this blurb. A separate blurb for the General Assembly could be proposed anyways. Nice4What (talk · contribs) – (Thanks ♥) 18:03, 23 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
While there seems to be consensus on notability, the opposes for quality reasons should be considered separately, and there doesn't seem to be consensus on that aspect yet. I'm wondering if the general debate article could be expanded to discuss this wave of recognition in more detail, as the broader list article might not be the place for such specific details. Chaotic Enby (talk · contribs) 18:11, 23 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
It appears that these announcements were deliberately scheduled to take place at the start of the 80th session.
As the leaders of all relevant countries are going to be making speeches, it's a good opportunity to assess the impact of these developments.
For example, Netanyahu will be making his speech to the UN on Friday.
As there's still lots of work to be done in updating our article (s), we should be drawing on this week of diplomatic activity to document and clarify the current situation. Andrew🐉(talk) 18:54, 23 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose as per the map in the article, most countries in the world already recognised Palestine as a state. Also, seems like token actionism by UK, France etc, as nothing will change on the ground for the time being. Khuft (talk) 18:29, 23 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Consensus[edit]
Admin comment I find that there is consensus to post Alt3, but quality issues need to be addressed before we can do so. Can I encourage interested parties to address the quality issues? Maybe it's best if subsequent discussion focusses on where quality is at. Schwede66 03:25, 24 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Two votes in favor of alt3 (one of which is based on the false equivalent that the recognitions are Canadian-led, despite many reliable sources calling it French-led), while four editors are explicitly in favor of alt1 and an additional editor is in favor of either? There is however a prevailing consensus to not single out Commonwealth countries. Nice4What (talk · contribs) – (Thanks ♥) 17:11, 24 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The lead of the target article still doesn't tell the reader that some specific event has just happened.
The alt3 blurb would be quite vague too, not listing specific countries and so the reader would not have any way of understanding exactly what happened.
And, looking at the general coverage, it doesn't seem that these announcements have made a big impact which is getting continuing coverage.
That's partly because they have been made separately on different days and partly because they are generally perceived to be making little practical difference.
And so they are lost in the general hubbub of the UN in which all countries struggle to be heard as they make their statements and speeches about various important matters such as Ukraine, climate change and more. Andrew🐉(talk) 09:10, 25 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I've added two paragraphs about the recent developments to International recognition of Palestine § Renewed membership efforts and additional rights at the UN, alongside a brief mention in the lead.

Oppose per Andrew, and because it is covered in ongoing. No one doubts that Israel is also committing atrocities, but let us not forget that genocide is a crime, a legal concept that is declared by criminal courts (in this case, it will be the ICC that rules on it), not us. There is a risk of bias.

This is incorrect. Genocide has a solid definition under international criminal law ("acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group"), while ethnic cleansing is a euphemism that does not have a recognised legal definition. --Grnrchst (talk) 09:51, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

–DMartin –DMartin 17:04, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The problem is that requires proof that Israel is trying to destroy the Palestinians, rather than move them elsewhere. We've ran into this problem here before with rape, because legal definitions vary from place to place; while digital penetration is rape in some jurisdictions, it's only sexual assault in other jurisdictions. I've never heard "ethnic cleansing" (or sexual assault) called an euphemism before - though I do see a note in the dictionary that "This and related terms are often regarded as euphemistic in intention". I see ethnic cleansing as an easier bar, that no one could dispute, given the announcements by Israel of clearing Gaza, and the US announcements about planning to build resorts there. I just don't see how "Destroy" is proven in a court of law (and it hasn't been). Here's a question then @Grnrchst and @Dmartin969, given the high bar and non-universal acceptance of the Rome Statute genocide definition, and the possibly euphemistic "ethnic cleansing", what else could be used. Maybe we simply change the Ongoing from "Gaza War" to "Gaza".

Support. I'm not an expert in this topic, and I usually try to steer clear of Israel–Palestine issues on Wikipedia because I have neither the expertise nor the time and energy to become embroiled in that saga. But looking at the talk page of the Gaza genocide, article I see that an RFC closed today which effectively endorses the view that calling it a genocide can now be done in Wikipedia's voice. In particular, the lead now states that while the label was "controversial at first, it is now supported by a wide academic consensus". As such, with the WP:DUEWEIGHT opinion and Wikipedia's voice apparently now calling this a genocide without equovocation, I think this is a clear-cut topic that should be in ongoing. There are some opposes above based on this being already covered by the Gaza war listing, but it seems to me that if, as implied by the RFC result, this is truly regarded as a genocide by scholars, then it is clearly significant enough to be listed separately. We wouldn't have vetoed the Rwandan genocide as an ongoing topic just because it was "already covered by the Rwandan Civil War" would we?  — Amakuru (talk) 14:11, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

I'm not familiar with the scholarly scene that is concerned by the allegations of genocide in Ukraine, but I don't reckon that it is nearly as vivid as the scene concerned by Gaza genocide (see Template:Expert opinions in the Gaza genocide debate), and I don't think there is as much consensus among scholars and experts (more than 280 sources in favor of the characterisation, quoting more than 1000 scholars/experts), if it is the case, then I believe we should start arguing for the legitimacy of a Ukraine genocide claim, in its talk page, not here — 🧀Cheesedealer !!!⚟ 20:31, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Ongoing is not the right place to keep track of such complexities because an ongoing entry is just a link.
Blurbs are better because they provide some brief narrative to explain the event and issue.
There was no consensus for a blurb in this case and so it seems quite improper for an ongoing entry to be proposed when it would be a worse way of listing the matter at ITN. Andrew🐉(talk) 21:23, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Ongoing exists simply to provide readers with a quick link to topics that are in the news and deemed to be significant, but in a longterm fashion rather than as a point-in-time event. Often ongoing events begin with a big-bang event that is noteworthy as a blurb. Occasionally though, it's something like this that is more cumulative with ongoing status despite no blurb event significant enough by itself. The war has been going on for two years now, but it's only recently and in a gradual fashion that scholarly consensus has reached the conclusion it seemingly has, according to the RFC result.  — Amakuru (talk) 23:16, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Thank you for your very considered opinion on the matter, Amakuru. Schwede66 03:44, 22 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support. I am commenting with the understanding that this is a contentious topic; it is a subject area I have largely avoided due to how contentious it is, and (to my recollection) I have only edited a single article in this area in over 6 years on the platform. But in this case I feel it necessary to add my voice. As Amakaru above has pointed out, an RfC on the Gaza genocide has established that there is academic consensus that it should be considered a genocide and it can be called as such in wikivoice; this conclusion is supported by the International Association of Genocide Scholars, Doctors Without Borders, Amnesty International, a UN special committee and an independent UN commission, the latter of which presented evidence finding the State of Israel to be carrying out 4 of the 5 genocidal acts outlined in the Genocide Convention (which legally defines genocide). I understand the people that say it is already covered by the Gaza war, but the genocide itself is being covered on a daily basis by the international press and scholarly publications. I also understand the appeals to exercise caution above, but think some might be mistaking silence for neutrality. I worry that arguments against posting are veering into arguments to avoid, i.e. basing our decisions on appropriateness of a story or whether or not it might cause offence. At the end of the day, the Gaza genocide meets the In the News criteria for article quality and the significance of the event. For these reasons and more, I am in support of it being added to the ongoing section, in brackets next to the Gaza war. --Grnrchst (talk) 15:04, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Support, per Amakuru and Grnrchst. The argument that it is already covered by "ongoing" doesn't cut it because the war article covers the conflict between Israel and the Palestinian factions and doesn't give a lot of weight to the genocide itself (rightfully ofc). The genocide deserves to have its own "ongoing" entry considering how abundantly covered it is in the media, serving WP:NEUTRALITY and to avoid WP:FALSEBALANCE. These latter policies should be sufficient also to address the argument stating how such an addition would be inflammatory especially considering how it is largely supported in the scholarly scene — 🧀Cheesedealer !!!⚟ 18:32, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Comment a major problem here is that ITN's ongoing line lacks the context of article space (where on the article the lede quickly explains that this is still a controversial wording though has broader agreement in scholarly sources). "Genocide" is still a word that carries criminality with it, and without the context of article space, just adding "Gaza genocide" in parathesis after the Gaza conflict is going to to be controversial itself without the space to contextualize this. That's a major issue specific to ITN and lack of space to give the needed context, because otherwise it would appear that WP in Wikitext supports calling it a genocide. I don't know if there a briefer wording that could be used like "(accusations of genocide)" that would step that claim out of Wikivoice (which is what the article itself does too). Masem (t) 20:25, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Masem: Wikipedia already supports calling it a genocide simply because the article is named ‘Gaza genocide’, and this already has potentially huge implications (please see this letter from the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform addressed to the CEO of the Wikimedia Foundation). So, opposing this on the grounds that it’s contentious to call it a ‘genocide’ is thwarting consensus reached elsewhere on Wikipedia.--Kiril Simeonovski (talk) 20:39, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Being titled like that is mitigated that by the nature of the first lede paragraph that explains it is not a fact in Wikivoice, and my scan of the article shows no significant place where it is reiterated as a genocide as Wikivoice-fact but always with some type of attribution or the like. The context of the article space provides that room. A listing at ITN ongoing does not. Masem (t) 21:29, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The opening paragraph reads The Gaza genocide is the ongoing systematic destruction of the Palestinian people in Gaza by Israel by means of blockade, invasion, and bombing of the strip with the manifest intent of senior Israeli leaders in the context of the war that is taking place there. Although this characterisation of Israel's campaign in Gaza was controversial at first, it is now supported by a wide academic consensus. where the last sentence clearly states that it’s no longer controversial and there’s wide academic consensus. I don’t see how this mitigates the genocide claim.--Kiril Simeonovski (talk) 21:53, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
But still doesn't state it definitely in Wikivoice. The article doesn't step on that line, just edges as close as possible from a NPOV angle. Masem (t) 23:24, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Masem, I believe there is now consensus that wikipedia should describe the events in Gaza as "genocide as a fact in Wikipedia voice" (although Beland can correct me if I'm reading their close incorrectly).VR (Please ping on reply) 00:09, 22 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

There would be no second sentence of the lede, just leaving as is without having to explain who considers it a genocide, and most of the sections in the article explaining why this is justified as a genocide would not need to be present; in much the same way we don't have any questions of doubt of the Holocaust on that article, putting the doubts to a wholly separate page. (And FWIW I fully believe it is a genocide there, just that from NPOV we need to be real careful for WP to present that without any attribution or caveats) Masem (t) 01:03, 22 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I don't really follow this argument. The article literally says "the Gaza genocide is the ongoing systematic destruction...". Saying "this was controversial but now most scholars agree" does not mean we're not saying it is in Wikivoice. It's just doing our due diligence by mentioning dissenting viewpoints. Lewisguile (talk) 21:47, 22 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
That article has a whole readily establishes that naming the as a genocide is a controversial topic but many scholars and political have come to call it that, and otherwise the article as a whole carefully navigates any explicit statement that says it is a genocide in wiki voice without the context of it being a controversial concept.

Weak support – When we're to decide consensus based on strength of arguments, the concerns that the term Gaza genocide is against "Wikivoice" should be disregarded. As several editors have explained, consensus has already been reached to use this term; and a quick read of the article shows that though this term has been controversial (as are most recent characterizations of genocide), there is a prevailing agreement among experts that it is genocide (which is not the case for Ukraine). I believe this might already be covered by "Gaza war" in ongoing, but I lean towards support because of the amount of daily edits and other compelling arguments left by editors here.

It is just four days prior that a discussion occurred on essentially the same topic, and this seems like an second bite at the apple.

If this request is an outgrowth of the September 16th discussion, it should have been posted under September 16th.

Support As someone who succesfully nominated Gaza famine for ITN sometime ago, I was on the fence whether the article/topic is apt for an ongoing listing. But arguments here and at the previous UN nom have convinced me so. The genocide and related topics simply cannot be forever pushed under the euphemism of the war as GreatCaesarsGhost put it or as Amakuru says opposing arguments put here so forth simply would not have or will be tenable for other similar events. If anything the main facet of the ongoing crisis is not the 'war' itself but the commission of this genocide. I find the opposing arguments that this is either too controversial (irrelevant for determining Ongoing siginificance) or that this is cannot be stated in 'wikivoice' (one of the most massive RfCs and compilation of academic opinions resulted in an affirmative for that) unconvinving. Gotitbro (talk) 05:44, 22 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
"War" is not a euphemism; it's an ancient blunt word which implies battle, death, destruction and other unpleasantness.

The supposed genocide is an aspect or component of the war.
The article Gaza war has an entire paragraph about genocide in its lead and lots of details in the body.
So, the reader will find plenty of material about the genocide issue easily by going to the war article.
The separate link is therefore redundant and clutter which is not sensible when ITN is so tight on space.
We have entire major wars such as Myanmar being completely ignored so that Gaza can hog the limelight.

@Andrew Davidson: Andrew, even though I frequently disagree with your comments here at this board, I do believe they are a valid part of discussions. But it also happens that they often do seem pointy at times and describing the posting here of a mere piped link to an ongoing genocide as 'Gaza hogging the limelight' is as impolite and uncivil as it can get in a CTOPS discussion like this. Please don't. Gotitbro (talk) 22:08, 23 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Weak support I agree with Amakuru and others both that we can say genocide in Wikivoice and the genocide is distinct from the war. The only outstanding question in my mind is whether WP:ITNSIGNIF has been met. The 1000 edits since 29 July figure is misleading as there have been numerous edits related to reference formatting in that time span, so I don't think that is sufficient to demonstrate significance. Maybe this is mitigated somewhat by having numerous spinoff articles like Cultural discourse about the Gaza genocide that are also being actively updated? In my view, news coverage of the genocide (as opposed to general war coverage) has been significant, particularly in light of the recent UN commission report, but I am not sure that it's been fully demonstrated here. EvansHallBear (talk) 06:21, 22 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose My concerns is that most RS saying this is a "genocide" are still potentially biased against Israel. Plus, the recent COI report even has many holes in its reasoning with selective misinterpretation of statements by Israeli leaders and assumes that the civilian deaths in Gaza are only the result of deliberate targeting by Israel (as UN Watch pointed out). And I said before: this is just the UN COI report which does not officially speak on behalf of the UN. If the UN eventually accepts the report and declares it a genocide, then I will have no choice but to support it as a significant event.--ZKang123 (talk · contribs) 06:34, 22 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Support - The Gaza genocide, an ongoing genocide, is perfectly fit for the ongoing section alongside the Gaza war. Combining the entries seems most appropriate. Those users expressing doubt or claims of bias should check Template:Expert opinions in the Gaza genocide debate to see that almost every major human rights organization and scholarly organization is referring to the events as a genocide, and this was confirmed in the recent RfC on Talk:Gaza Genocide.

Oppose The sources claiming a genocide are not reliable. The claims fall flat on their face given the lack of intent to destroy (despite fringe politicians suggesting such) and the immense efforts Israel has made to prevent casualties and provide aid which is entirely unprecedented in war. Not to mention even if there was intent, its been highly ineffective. The only genocide in history where the alleged victims started the conflict with an actual genocidally intended massacre, have maintained their intent to commit such again, and took numerous hostages, 20% of which are still held. If you are being genocided, you would do anything possible to end it. Not sadistically hold people starving in dungeons and mock the alleged perpetrators.

Oppose per @Andrew Davidson and @Alsoriano97 on this contentious topic. I believe it is part of the existing Gaza war entry. And despite the nominator's efforts, this comes across as an attempt to shoehorn the earlier UN Commission report, rejected as an ITN entry, into an ITN entry nonetheless. Otherwise, why has the ITN entry for the Gaza war been viewed as sufficient until now, but now it supposedly needs to be expanded? Coining (talk) 03:29, 25 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Posted in ongoing[edit]
Based on the discussion above, I have changed the entry in "ongoing" from "Gaza war (timeline)" to "Gaza war (timeline · genocide)". There is now rough consensus for this later proposal, which takes into account the earlier concerns of a redundancy to the "ongoing" entry. Also, a recent RFC resulted in consensus to present this genocide as a fact in Wikipedia's voice, an editorial choice about which I myself have no opinion, but which seems to me to override the remaining concerns of non-neutrality.

Comment If this is to be blurbed, there needs to be a significant amount of reasons why he was considered a major figure (accidental death from scuba diving, I don't makes "death as the story" here). The sources that I am seeing about his death, even though there are tributes made, aren't the same type of level I'd expect for a major entertainment figure, but I could be wrong. Masem (t) 13:44, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Zubeen Garg was like a big figure in Both Bengal and Assam, an entire generation (Including me) grew up listening to his song on Television. From what I know, he was such a big deal in Assam that an entire bridge, and statue was made in his name BengalMC (talk) 13:52, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I do see that in the sources, but we don't the idea of a major figure simply on fame or popularity. We're not looking necessarily at internataion or national significance but I feel from what I read in these obit sources that he's recognized across India but that's mainly a popularity thing, he didn't, for example, transform the Indian music industry or similar scale of significance. Masem (t) 13:56, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
So, if you see current all Assamese news everything is abt the memory of Zubeen Garg and etc.
He transformed the Assamese music scene with a lot of people that I personally know + more saying that he was the major successor to Bhupen Hazarika and right now there is no one to success him other than maybe Papon but he is mainly focusing on Bollywood and other parts of music other than Assamese music so he (Late Garg) definitely does deserve the spot.
Right now there were lakhs (tens of thousands) of people following the ambulance carrying the body of Late Garg and just for touching the ambulance people were pushing and fighting around so you can really see the impact that he has made.
If you look at recent visuals the amount of gamusas (basically symbolic cloth that shows that a person is very respected) on the ambulance maybe in the thousands (I'm not sure).
I won't elaborate on the cultural significance as I was born in a different generation(Gen Alpha) but I still deeply respect him and right now every one in the Assamese community is saying we should never forget Zubeen Garg, with a bunch of people even crying and even I ws even though I was born in Gen A.
I rest my case. Gyaan is smart (talk) 08:00, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

"All Assamese news" and "the Assamese music scene" being the keys here. The heuristic I'm applying is: Would this be front-page news on CNN or the New York Times or El Pais? No. Are enough users interested in this story to afford it a one-click link from the homepage? No.
Even the BBC, which tends to afford undue attention to less-notable subcontinental topics, didn't prominently feature this nor did they send me a push notification breaking the news of his death. Dr Fell (talk) 03:32, 22 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
your original post was about notability of course he wouldn't be on BBC or El Pais because he didn't transform the music scene there.
As an Assamese myself I would say he was probably one of the singers that transformed the Assamese music genre from old and slow to the modern fast to medium pace style now.
Point is, if he had done the same, being born in another country, transforming the music scene so largely like this of course he would've been headlined.
Just because you don't know the culture in Assam please don't say he "Isn't notable enough" no offense to you too as I don't imagine your from the northeast of India or India itself.
Another point is almost all the chief ministers of the states of northeast India came to Garg's funeral
Will definitely be making a separate article for his funeral in the coming days.(I have exams, I'm a kid OK?) Gyaan is smart (talk) 13:29, 23 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

While I probably wouldn’t have put it in as harsh terms as Dr Fell did, all this indicates to me is that his notability wasn’t even national, but regional, which really doesn’t help the case for a blurb.

Support RD, Oppose Blurb I supported Liam Payne for a blurb as there the circumstances of the death itself received headline coverage but it wasn't ultimately blurbed AFAIK. While the death here is unusual, the death is not the story here. We then turn to the "transforming" criteria, the figure is certainly notable in the Assam region of India (and Assamese music broadly) but for ITN we have to look for significance beyond the regional level which hasn't been evidenced here. A similar nom that I remember was of KK (singer) where the death was the story but it wasn't ultimately blurbed either. So, I oppose a blurb here though an RD is perfectly fine, all basic criteria are met for that. Gotitbro (talk) 17:13, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Just because Liam Payne and KK didn't get featured, doesn't mean Garg shouldn't. Correct our mistakes instead of just equalling both and saying "Oh this was the outcome so it should always be the same."
100% Payne should've been on the Blurb but he didn't I have no idea why.
KK was a bit less renowned. 100% he was a household name but not as much transformative.
On the national level (as you've given)-
Bridging Regional and National Music
Zubeen Garg brought the sound and cultural identity of Assam and the Northeast into the Indian mainstream.
His Bollywood breakout with Ya Ali (2006) made him a household name across India, showing that an Assamese artist could dominate the Hindi film industry’s music scene.
Representation of the Northeast in Popular Culture
At a time when the Northeast often felt culturally invisible in mainstream Indian media, Garg’s success gave the region a visible face.
He became a symbol of pride for Northeastern youth, proving their voices could resonate nationwide.
Versatility Across Languages
He recorded songs in more than 20 Indian languages, including Hindi, Assamese, Bengali, Tamil, Telugu, and Marathi.
This multilingual reach broke linguistic barriers and allowed him to connect with diverse Indian audiences.
Influence on Indian Pop and Indie Scenes
Long before independent music became trendy in India, Garg was producing and performing outside the Bollywood system.
His blend of folk, rock, and modern sounds helped shape the Indian pop music landscape.
Cultural Integration Through Music
By mixing Assamese folk instruments and melodies with contemporary styles, he introduced Indian audiences to new textures and traditions.
His work played a role in broadening the definition of “Indian music” beyond Bollywood’s center.
Activism and Social Voice
Nationally, he was also noted for lending his voice to issues like environmentalism, regional identity, and social justice.
This made him not just a singer but a cultural figure who pushed conversations at a larger Indian level
No offense but I really think not having him on it is like not having the death of Charlie Kirk on the front page of the NY times. THATS how transformative he was Gyaan is smart (talk) 13:37, 23 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
All of that would need to be clearly summarized with reliable sources on the article if those are just your arguments, that gives no persuasion that we'd need to see how reliable sources considered him Masem (t) 14:02, 23 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
will definately be expanding on the article and maybe making another page for his death.

I'm not convinced this should be posted, but I'll play devil's advocate:International agreements of various sorts frequently get signed, including partnership agreements, but just how common are actual mutual defense pacts of this sort? The article Defense pact only lists five after 1992, with this being one of them. It's possible that the list is incomplete, but that doesn't seem "extremely common". 98.170.164.88 (talk) 04:34, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Comment This is similar to the Australia/PNG pact in that it extends and formalises existing close relations.
And it's being made public to deter potential aggressors.
The specific trigger seems to be the recent Israeli strike on Doha which the US did nothing about.
The target article doesn't comment on the weakening of US credibility as a security guarantor in the region – a point which appears in the sources.
Such implications and ramifications take time to work out in practice so, like the Australia/PNG case, I'm not sure we should headline this as a big announcement. Andrew🐉(talk) 06:27, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

(talk • contribs) 13:21, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
That's a good point User:Bzweebl. The more I think about it, it's hard for me to think of a similar agreement outside of NATO in the 1940s and the Warsaw Pact in the 1950s. Any further thoughts User:Masem? This easily theoretically puts Pakistani nuclear missiles in the range of parts of NATO - not to mention the entire Middle East, not just the eastern Persian Gulf. Nfitz (talk) 21:52, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
For one, the article has none of the specifics of the agreement in it, so it is impossible to tell what the significance is. Also, generally such agreements need ratification by the legislative bodies of the signing nations before it can be realized. Masem (t) 23:46, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support Oppose - shouldn't it be the summit that's in the ITN? Not the treaty signed by two attending powers? There's always treaties of some kind being signed at such events. I don't even see this mentioned in the article on the summit. Nfitz (talk) 14:15, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Changing to support - I've been convinced that this isn't a routine agreement, given the inclusion of nuclear weapons. Nfitz (talk) 03:58, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Or the state visit of the Pakistani PM to Saudi Arabia? Andrew🐉(talk) 16:23, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The extraordinary one. It's the same tour by the PM, and they were both in Doha for the summit, a stones throw from Saudi. Nfitz (talk) 21:43, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Strong support Every international defense agreement/pact/treaty should be posted (why wasn't the North Korean–Russian Treaty on Comprehensive Strategic Partnership posted?). ArionStar (talk) 03:55, 20 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
While I agree with the posting here, disagree with "Every international defense agreement/pact/treaty should be posted". Not each one of these might be significant and we will have to decide the merits on a case by case basis. The siginificance here comes from the impact of nuclear weapons, other cases may lack such lynchpin factors. Gotitbro (talk) 17:21, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support I think this differs from the Australia/PNG pact in that it was actually signed. Hawkeye7 (discuss) 03:02, 21 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support I was initially ambivalent, but after thinking about it, I would probably support posting any new mutual defense pact. This one seems to be significant on its own merits. Both countries are major regional powers with various entanglements and tensions.

Article updatedNominator's comments: This is an ongoing story in the news that just keeps going and getting worse; just look at the history here of the full article. This new development, I just saw in the news. This is a huge escalation of things it seems in US politics after the assassination of Charlie Kirk. Please look here for the particular new development: Detention and deportation of American citizens in the second Trump administration#Mass arrest of New York officials by ICE (15). Thanks. — Very Polite Person (talk/contribs) 03:17, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support The mass arrest of state officials is unusual and notable. --MtPenguinMonster (talk) 03:26, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose This is not the first time that state officials have been arrested in trying to check up on detained immigrants held in ICE centers (last time they were only held for a few hours or overnight, so it was just for show). Its also far from the biggest news related to US politics right now, that being the attack on the First Amendment via the cancellation of Jimmy Kimmel's show (which I'm not suggesting should be posted because its US politics and of NTRUMP). Masem (t) 03:55, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I was surprised that no one nominated the cancellation of Jimmy Kimmel's show. Hawkeye7 (discuss) 04:28, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
We should say "suspension," not "cancellation," at least as far as we know so far, for accuracy's sake, right? Ryan Reeder (talk) 04:48, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Its a news story but not really yet at the stage of being an encyclopedic article because what's happened after rests on a whole bunch of hypotheticals, opinions, and informed analysis. Many possible ends of this story would just be fizzling out of the news, while some I can see as potentially being far more encyclopedic and ITN worthy. That's the difficulty with most stories that involve politics, there's no clear endpoint to say if it is really significant from the long-term, encyclopedic view compared with the short-term, daily coverage and endless talking heads of the media.

STRONGEST OPPOSE per Masem. 64.114 etc 15:03, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose The New York Times article makes clear this isn't a "mass arrest" so much as a political stunt. Brad Lander, one of those arrested, used this same tactic in June with the same result. The blurb is inaccurate, and arrests of trespassers in federal buildings is not notable. Dr Fell (talk) 04:05, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Ongoing The nomination says that this is an ongoing story and they are right.
So, this should be an ongoing nomination. Andrew🐉(talk) 06:30, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Re Charlie Kirk': since his blurb was bumped off ITN, shouldn't he appear in RD? 188.27.82.108 (talk) 07:16, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
You can bring this up on WP:ERRORS. 5.57.242.223 (talk) 08:39, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
No, it shouldn't. This is how ITN works.
_-_Alsor (talk) 10:14, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose per Masem.

Oppose The page reads too much like original research - as if it's trying to make a point. Still, I don't see it being particularly noteworthy - this kind of abuse isn't unusual in flawed democracies like that one. If we had an ongoing for every individual country where stuff happens, we'd have 100+ ongoings. I'm surprised the article hasn't gone to AfD to tell the truth. Nfitz (talk) 14:10, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
That article demonstrates a lot of the NOTNEWS problem on WP (editors trying to document every tiny event in some fashion than the big picture), as well as a RGW-type problem (along the lines of "we have to document these improper arrests made by this admin to show how bad it is"). Masem (t) 14:22, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose big news, but domestic news. It doesn't have that much of a big impact. Chorchapu (talk | edits) 16:15, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose *Yawn*, not another domestic-based WP:ITNTRUMP nomination. Doesn't have a worldwide impact.

Oppose I feel like Trumpet has already tried that this year. CREditzWiki (Talk to me!!) 16:51, 19 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

References[edit]
Nominators often include links to external websites and other references in discussions on this page. It is usually best to provide such links using the inline URL syntax [http://example.com] rather than using <ref></ref> tags, because that keeps all the relevant information in the same place as the nomination without having to jump to this section, and facilitates the archiving process.
For the times when <ref></ref> tags are being used, here are their contents:
