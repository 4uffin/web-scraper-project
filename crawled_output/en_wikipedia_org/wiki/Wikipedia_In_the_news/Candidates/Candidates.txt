This page provides a place to discuss new items for inclusion on In the news (ITN), a protected template on the Main Page (see past items in the ITN archives). Do not report errors in ITN items that are already on the Main Page here— discuss those at the relevant section of WP:ERRORS.
This candidates page is integrated with the daily pages of Portal:Current events. A light green header appears under each daily section – it includes transcluded Portal:Current events items for that day. You can discuss ITN candidates under the header.

Glossary[edit]
Blurbs are one-sentence summaries of the news story.
Altblurbs, labelled alt1, alt2, etc., are alternative suggestions to cover the same story.
A target article, bolded in text, is the focus of the story. Each blurb must have at least one such article, but you may also link non-target articles.
Articles in the Ongoing line describe events getting continuous coverage.
The Recent deaths (RD) line includes any living thing whose death was recently announced. Consensus may decide to create a blurb for a recent death.
All articles linked in the ITN template must pass our standards of review. They should be up-to-date, demonstrate relevance via good sourcing and have at least an acceptable quality.
Nomination steps[edit]
Make sure the item you want to nominate has an article that meets our minimum requirements and contains reliable coverage of a current event you want to create a blurb about. We will not post about events described in an article that fails our quality standards.
Find the correct section below for the date of the event (not the date nominated). Do not add sections for new dates manually – a bot does that for us each day at midnight (UTC).
Create a level 4 header with the article name (==== Your article here ====). Add (RD) or (Ongoing) if appropriate.
Then paste the {{ITN candidate}} template with its parameters and fill them in. The news source should be reliable, support your nomination and be in the article. Write your blurb in simple present tense. Below the template, briefly explain why we should post that event. After that, save your edit. Your nomination is ready!
You may add {{ITN note}} to the target article's talk page to let editors know about your nomination.
The better your article's quality, the better it covers the event and the wider its perceived significance (see WP:ITNSIGNIF for details), the better your chances of getting the blurb posted.

Headers[edit]
When the article is ready, updated and there is consensus to post, you can mark the item as (Ready). Remove that wording if you feel the article fails any of these necessary criteria.
Admins should always separately verify whether these criteria are met before posting blurbs marked (Ready). For more guidance, check WP:ITN/A.
If satisfied, change the header to (Posted).
Where there is no consensus, or the article's quality remains poor, change the header to (Closed) or (Not posted).
Sometimes, editors ask to retract an already-posted nomination because of a fundamental error or because consensus changed. If you feel the community supports this, remove the item and mark the item as (Pulled).
Voicing an opinion on an item[edit]
Format your comment to contain "support" or "oppose", and include a rationale for your choice. In particular, address the notability of the event, the quality of the article, and whether it has been updated.
Please do...[edit]
ShortcutWP:ITNCDOWP:ITNCDO
Pick an older item to review near the bottom of this page, before the eligibility runs out and the item scrolls off the page and gets abandoned in the archive, unused and forgotten.
Review an item even if it has already been reviewed by another user. You may be the first to spot a problem, or the first to confirm that an identified problem was fixed. Piling on the list of "support!" votes will help administrators see what is ready to be posted on the Main Page.
Tell about problems in articles if you see them. Be bold and fix them yourself if you know how, or tell others if it's not possible.
Please do not...[edit]
ShortcutWP:ITNCDONTWP:ITNCDONT
Add simple "support!" or "oppose!" votes without including your reasons. Similarly, curt replies such as "who?", "meh", or "duh!" are not helpful. A vote without reasoning means little for us, please elaborate yourself.
Oppose an item just because the event is only relating to a single country, or failing to relate to one. We post a lot of such content, so these comments are generally unproductive.
Accuse other editors of supporting, opposing or nominating due to a personal bias (such as ethnocentrism). We at ITN do not handle conflicts of interest.
Comment on a story without first reading the relevant article(s).
Oppose a recurring item here because you disagree with the recurring items criteria. Discuss them here.
Use ITN as a forum for your own political or personal beliefs. Such comments are irrelevant to the outcome and are potentially disruptive.
Suggesting updates[edit]
There are two places where you can request corrections to posted items:
Anything that does not change the intent of the blurb (spelling, grammar, markup issues, updating death tolls etc.) should be discussed at WP:Errors.
Discuss major changes in the blurb's intent or very complex updates as part of the current ITNC nomination.

Oppose as ongoing, as this would already be covered by the Gaza ongoing. If this was meant to cover the drone strike (given the sources listed), that was last week (Sept 9) and that would make this very stale as a news item. Masem (t) 03:22, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Oppose per above. Suggest that it's unlikely to be blurbworthy whatever the case, given that it's covered by ongoing, and we may soon have another Gaza blurb This post was made by orbitalbuzzsaw gang (talk) 08:06, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose - definitely covered by ongoing, and if it were not, I would not consider this activity in itself to be anything like significant enough to merit a slot in Ongoing for itself. GenevieveDEon (talk) 08:58, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I feel like this kind of article would've been a better "ongoing" target than our indefinite war articles. I like how it's specific and I would love to be able to feature the work that is being put into this article. I think it would be a lot more helpful to readers to feature articles like these than to feature the largest-scale article possible. Sadly, currently, we don't really have a space for this kind of ongoing subject. ~Maplestrip/Mable (chat) 10:14, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Its not even a good ongoing, which is meant for stories with near daily news coverage and updates. This flotilla pops up in the news every now and then but definitely nowhere close to that daily coverage we expect. Masem (t) 12:00, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose per above. Mayyybe we could blurb it if something major happens with the current one but definitely not an ongoing and we'd do the article about the specific flottilla.. Chorchapu (talk | edits) 13:12, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose. A minor part of the humanitarian response to the Gaza war, and one that hasn't even reached its destination. No major ramifications yet, and I doubt there ever will be. Modest Genius talk 15:17, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Comments should focus on whether the quality of the article meets WP:ITNRD.Nominator's comments: Redford's very much in reasonable territory of being a major figure in Hollywood, though I feel the article could do a bit more on legacy for this point, but I'm going to consider a blurb already here since I know it would otherwise be added later.
However, the article is unsourced in several places, so its not ready for RD yet. Masem (t) 12:19, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Support RD Article is well-developed and in a good enough state although the Personal life and death section is a little proselineish.
Since that covers the substantive update it could probably do with fleshing out a little.
Not supporting a blurb but not violently against one either, over the course of his career yes he really is one of the greats, but his heyday was several decades ago and I'm not sure that he reaches the requisite threshold of current popular notability, i.e. are enough readers going to actively click through to justify a blurb? 3142 (talk) 12:43, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
We don't make a distinction if a person's significance was well in the past or more recent, only that it is well demonstrated. Masem (t) 13:10, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
You may not; I do.
Notability for this purpose is a different threshold to general articles.
ITN is supposed to be a service to the readership, to enable readers to easily find articles of interest.
It is not our role to tell the reader what they should be interested in, and if no-one is the coverage is entirely pointless.
Rather it is better directed to something people are interested in. 3142 (talk) 16:35, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
"he reaches the requisite threshold of current popular notability, i.e. are enough readers going to actively click through to justify a blurb?" this is not a requirement for blurb, because we have blurbed people who are not that well-known, but yes, enough readers will actively click. BilboBeggins (talk) 18:22, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose at present: too much unsourced material for MP inclusion. Would support RD only once the article is up to spec. Adding: I suspect this will end up being posted as a blurb, not because it's justified, but because of the usual fanboy voting will ignore the purpose of having RD. - SchroCat (talk) 12:53, 16 September 2025 (UTC) (Addendum added SchroCat (talk) 15:59, 16 September 2025 (UTC)) Moved to supporting, but still RD only.

How's the quality now @SchroCat:? I've done my best in adding sources and beefing up a legacy section to show his impact not only to filmmaking, but to independent films/environmentalism. TDKR Chicago 101 (talk) 18:16, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Weak support blurb given his sheer number of accolades and resulting influence. Oppose on quality as article still needs a lot of work, however. The Kip (contribs) 13:21, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support blurb. Has two Academy Awards, created Sundance. "In his ’70s heyday, few actors possessed Redford’s star wattag", "as a movie star in his prime, few could touch him". "A godfather for independent film". [1]. Has starred in three films that won Academy Award for Best Picture. That is a shoe-in for blurb.
BilboBeggins (talk) 14:05, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Simply having won or starred in award winning films is not sufficient, but it is noted that he was considered one of the great actors in part because he won those awards, in addition to the other stuff he did to promote indie films and establishing Sundance. Masem (t) 14:19, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I know that being Oscar winner only does not automatically qualify for blurb. But winning competitive Oscar and getting Honrary Award is rare, and he won almost every major award.
And he is one offew figures who are not only householda names, but are also tranformative. BilboBeggins (talk) 16:50, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I think the fact that his “heyday” was 50 years ago is also relevant. –DMartin 01:10, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Not in doubt here but it would be helpful to add this to the existing death and legacy section (which is already being done) to better justify the blurb for others. Masem (t) 14:44, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support Blurb He was a very well known actor and director and had a very lengthy career. Also. he helped founding the Sundance festival which has became one of the most famous movie festivals in the world, therefore a very notable legacy. LiamKorda 14:38, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Support blurb—A highly transformative and iconic figure in both cinema and beyond. Founder of the Sundance Film Festival, used his platform to elevate major social issues of our time, Academy Awards as both an actor and director, etc. I feel he meets the high threshold for blurbing an actor.

Comment @3142:, @The Kip:, @Masem:, @SchroCat:, @NoonIcarus:: I've expanded the legacy section which depicts Redford's impact not only as a Hollywood icon, but for his impact on Independent films and how influential he was as an activist/environmentalist. I've also beefed up the article with sources so there's no more cn tags. The argument of the blurb can be seen for his impact not just towards Hollywood films, but also for independent filmmaking and for his environmentalism efforts. --TDKR Chicago 101 (talk) 16:45, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Oppose blurb Redford was obviously a big star in his 1970s heyday but I wouldn't say he's the very most recognised and transformative US film actor of his generation. Now, one could say he doesn't need to be - he was huge, much-awarded, features in some highly-acclaimed films - but I think we as users ought to be thinking about the long game with figures like this. I don't wish to sound morbid but there are a *lot* of very notable living North American film actors in their seventies, eighties and nineties that we are likely to discuss blurbing here in the next ten years or so, most of whom made their mark at a similar time to Redford. Dick Van Dyke, Mel Brooks, Clint Eastwood, William Shatner, Robert Duvall, Alan Alda, Shirley MacLaine, Woody Allen, Warren Beatty, Jack Nicholson, Morgan Freeman, Dustin Hoffman, Jane Fonda, Elliott Gould, Jon Voight, Harvey Keitel, F. Murray Abraham, Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Faye Dunaway, Sylvester Stallone, Barbra Streisand, Harrison Ford, Goldie Hawn, Christopher Walken, Michael Douglas, Steve Martin, Tommy Lee Jones, Susan Sarandon, Diane Keaton, Arnold Schwarzenegger (he is Austrian and American), Richard Dreyfuss, Samuel L. Jackson, Meryl Streep, Sigourney Weaver, Richard Gere and John Travolta are just a few names that spring to mind. There's also various Hollywood directors (Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese, George Lucas, Steven Spielberg, James Cameron), composers (John Williams) and non-American actors nevertheless associated with US film (Rita Moreno, Julie Andrews, Michael Caine and many more). All of these people are elderly, most of them are octogenarians or older, and I think it's fair to say that quite a few of them are dead certs for blurbs. Will all of their deaths be blurbed? Perhaps not but I think it's fair to say that most of them would be proposed and that a great many of them would get through ITN with the system and attitudes we have currently. There is going to be a real deluge of these figures, for many reasons (if I was to offer a pithy summary, Hollywood boomed in the 1960s and 70s and its hits were kept alive by television and home media, becoming part of a collective experience that is less achievable today) and with that in mind, I think we perhaps need to be somewhat brutal with who gets in and who doesn't.Humbledaisy (talk) 18:19, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Elliout Gould, F. Murray Abraham, Goldie Hawn, Steve Martin are nowhere near. Dick Van Dyke never won an Oscar, so did Harvey Keitel.
And I don't see any sense of discussing the blurbs for persons who are alive. Some of persons you mentioned will be blurbed, so I don't know how them possibly being on the same scale is argument for not blurbing Redford. BilboBeggins (talk) 18:43, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
If you're not interested in discussing the blurbs for alive people, why did you tell me which ones you think are nowhere near? As I said, "I think it's fair to say that most of them would be proposed and that a great many of them would get through ITN with the system and attitudes we have currently". I didn't say I think they'll all be blurbed. I just wanted to demonstrate the sheer amount of notable, award-winning US film actors of a certain vintage and the problem it may pose to ITN.Humbledaisy (talk) 19:26, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
"If you're not interested in discussing the blurbs for alive people, why did you tell me which ones you think are nowhere near?"
I am simply saying you can't compare with Redford people you can't compare with him.
Blurb discussions taking place won't hurt anyone, if we don't want them to happen, then we should make some definite rules for blurbing. BilboBeggins (talk) 19:48, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Let's say that's 50 ppl in that list, all with a likely chance to die from old age over the next ten years. That's five whole blurbs a year, which in no way weighs down ITN, but that also assumes quality is there and that it's clear of their legacy to the industry. That last part, I don't know how true that is for all on the list., as just being a star from that period is not a indicator of being a major figure. Redfprd's significance has been demonstrated but I'm not sure if that can be said for all of them listed. Masem (t) 19:15, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I'd suggest that five US film actors a year would be quite a significant weight on ITN. Combine it with UK film actors of the same vintage and it's going to be a great amount of one kind of notable person. That's all I'm trying to say. As I say, the names were off the top of my head and to make a point - I'm by no means suggesting they'll all be nominated or all be blurbed.Humbledaisy (talk) 19:26, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
John Travolta, aged 71, is likely to die withing the next 10 years? I haven't checked any other ages. Perhaps 30 to 40% of that dies in the next 10 years. So even less blurbs! Nfitz (talk) 23:29, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I guess I'll repeat myself again. I said that those names are likely to come up "in the next ten years or so". Travolta is also the youngest person of the many I named by almost five years. I don't want to grumble but I go to great pains to make myself clear on ITN, to anticipate and address any potential misunderstandings or unanswered questions (hence the length of my comment) and I still have to repeat myself.Humbledaisy (talk) 15:59, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
A lot of actors at RD and blurb discussions fail on sourcing, so that alone will likely cut down that list. I also doubt all of the actors you mention could get consensus to be blurbed even if the quality is sufficient. I see a few names on there that would be shoe-ins, a few that I highly doubt would make it, and a lot that could go either way. We're not going to have that much of a problem here. QuicoleJR (talk) 20:29, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I think there ought to be a discussion about establishing standards for blurb-worthy individuals.
My sensibilities may be more inclusive than some; I would include pretty much all of the names on that list, as they are household names and recognizable to a general audience of the English-speaking world, as well as many outside of that audience.
But where do we draw the line?
What system of measurements should we use?
Where would I draw the line, at least in terms of those in the entertainment industry?
Among some of the oldest in that field, I would probably put it somewhere around June Lockhart, William Daniels, Rosemary Harris, Marion Ross, Vera Miles, Joanne Woodward, John Astin, and Barbara Eden (all of whom are over 94).
Some of their roles are well-remembered, some quite fondly, but generally they are either known for primarily one role, or their work is much more familiar to the general public than their names, or in the case of Joanne Woodward, is still a bit overshadowed by someone else (her husband, Paul Newman), and derives at least some of her familiarity on the strength of that connection.
The names that Humbledaisy included are all known by their own names first, not for any single role, and therefore, it would be the death of the individual that would be blurb-worthy.
However, I'm not sure that the Robert Redford discussion is the place for this conversation (which, by the way, I would Support Blurb; as, if you don't include him, who would you include?) but I'm not sure what the proper place to have it would be.
Wikipedia editors have different sensibilities.
To some, it seems that "old man dies" is never news, but I can't tell you how many notable deaths I've learned about by coming to this page (and I started coming to the proposals page (and even occasionally contributing to it) instead of the main page because a lot of people get left off of the main page).
The purpose of an encyclopedia and of Wikipedia is to allow people to be informed, and including recent deaths and blurbing notable ones fulfills this purpose by allowing people to be informed.
I think we could also discuss other criteria for notability.
Is it necessary to blurb the recurring champions of every sport, including a regional dart-throwing championship, for example?
A change in head of state is significant, in principle, but is it necessary to include a change in the prime minister of Tuvalu, with a population of less than 10,000?
We have Recent Deaths for those not deemed sufficiently blurb-worthy, but not anything similar for other news items.
Again, I know it's not really the place for this discussion (but thank you for reading my thoughts if you have), but I think it would be advantageous to have it.
Perhaps someone could suggest the best place for it.Ryan Reeder (talk) 01:00, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Support blurb based on his tangible impact on the film industry, his enduring fame, and the fact that he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom. That Legacy section is impressive. QuicoleJR (talk) 20:31, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support RD; oppose blurb – Per Humbledaisy. Arguments based on his accolades are not entirely convincing as it's somewhat expected that a high-profile actor will receive a medal or two at some point; what matters is Redford being "transformative" within his field. Not exactly a household name in the 2020s either. Nice4What (talk · contribs) – (Thanks ♥) 21:21, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Nice4What: Redford was transformative in the film industry as the founder of the Sundance Institute, whose Sundance Film Festival played a key role in the rise of indie films. QuicoleJR (talk) 21:35, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
He is one of three founders of that festival (the most high profile name of the three), so I don't think we can really call him transformative by association. The reason we are considering him for a blurb is surely about acting and I don't think we've established that he was a transformative actor. Humbledaisy (talk) 22:14, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support blurb Iconic actor worldwide. Seeing the list above convinces me that we should blurb him. It is OK to have a healthy number of blurbed deaths to balance all the sports news and the accidents news. I would argue that iconic peoples bios are more encyclopedic than minor sports or random accidents. Tradediatalk 21:51, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Is it your intention to contribute to death-blurb discussion in a meaningful way, or merely to disrupt them? OLDMANDIES and 'underwater basket weaver' tell us about as much about the merits of the case as 'bus plunge' does about an arbitrarily selected public transport accident. There is still no requirement either for the manner of death to be notable, nor for the death to be treated as a discrete event in itself. Only your last point is even relevant in principle, but unfortunately it's wrong - Redford's death made front page news here in the UK, for example.

Needs work Level-5 vital and about 3 million readers on the news, making it the top read article yesterday.

@Andrew Davidson:, @EF5: & @GenevieveDEon:: Expanded the legacy & reception section by adding his status as a sex symbol and Redford's response to the label.

Weak support blurb in principle, but wait until the issues described by Andrew are addressed. Redford was a major household name and had a wider influence on the artform and industry from behind the camera, which is exactly the sort of thing we should consider influential in making these determinations, in my opinion. GenevieveDEon (talk) 09:04, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Posted blurb. You guys know me, I'm very often opposed to routine deaths of household names without demonstration of further notability... but looking at this with my admin hat on rather than as a contributor, I see a very clear consensus to blurb this one, with arguments of those arguing he was one of the top figures of the film industry in his time. I've also noted the "needs work" comments above, but I think there's also a broad consensus that this meets the minimum threshold for inclusion within ITN, as also hinted at in Masem's assessment above. Sure, it's not GA or FA level, and some prose on "his handsome appearance and charm which made him a sex symbol" (perhaps not in that language though?!) as well as his skiing hobbies would be good additions, but aren't fundamental to having a vaguely complete article.  — Amakuru (talk) 14:46, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Very weak oppose if only because I personally believe the ICJ case to be the metaphorical “big one” that we should post, but I’m willing to strike my vote if the community disagrees. If that happens, I prefer ALT1 - ALT2 has some superfluous bits and the original blurb is awkwardly-worded. The Kip (contribs) 13:16, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose - so what? It's not like the UN will do anything about it. EF5 13:16, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Don't think that's sufficient grounds for oppose. Also, the UN has also been heavily critical of Israel, mind, with a resolution recently passed advocating for a two-state solution and criticising Israel's military actions.--ZKang123 (talk · contribs) 10:43, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support alt1 (though switch to present tense). Whether the war in Gaza constitutes a genocide has been controversial and different bodies have made different assessments. This is the closest we're ever going to get to an 'official' determination. Genocide is enormously important and recognition of one certainly merits posting as an ITN blurb, in addition to the war itself being in the ongoing section. The article is an example of our best work, very well referenced and has been carefully updated. Modest Genius talk 13:37, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Modest Genius What about the ICJ case (albeit it’ll likely be a while before the ruling is even formulated, let alone released)? The Kip (contribs) 13:41, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I am not an expert on international law, but as I understand it the ICJ is responsible for determining whether a specific person is guilty of the crime of genocide, not the broader issue of whether a genocide occurred at all. The ICJ will likely take years or decades to bring anyone to trial (if it ever happens). For example, it was clear in the late 90s that there had been a genocide in Bosnia, but it took until 2016 for the ICJ to convict Karadžić of the crime, and the ICJ's own determination was of a much narrower legal sense that excluded many aspects of the conflict. So while an ICJ conviction would be big news in itself, I don't think it's the determining factor of whether genocide occurred. As an analogy: if someone is murdered, we don't wait years for a court conviction of the specific murderer before reporting that the death was a murder. Modest Genius talk 14:10, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Modest Genius I believe what you’re defining is the ICC, not the ICJ - the ICC prosecutes individuals, the ICJ nation-states. The Kip (contribs) 14:28, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
You're right, I mixed up the courts. For Bosnia, the relevant ICJ case was in 2007 - still more than a decade after the events. So I don't think that difference fundamentally changes the reasoning. Modest Genius talk 14:50, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Question of how binding this is or what actions this triggers. With the UN declaration of famine, that seemed to establish the need for more humanitarian programs to Gaza. This is a report by a three person panel and doesn't seem to have any immediate impact or even confirmation by the UN as a whole, so it seems less significant at this point.

Strongly oppose.
The Gaza genocide article has significant verifiability issues. -- mikeblas (talk) 14:25, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Mikeblas: This was a false-positive error and due to usage of {{invoke}} for short inline references.
See the response in your topic: Talk:Gaza_genocide#missing_citations
Unless you have other concerns, can you please strike down your assertion? Bogazicili (talk) 19:01, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Verifiability concerns remain. Dozens of footnotes show warnings for footnotes that don't have matching citations. There's no realistic way to tell which of those are false alarms and which are not, other than manually visiting each. Indeed, the use of {{invoke}} seems to cause false alarms in the code that indicates a footnote has no target. The use of {{invoke}} is required because the Wiki markup parser has a limitation in the amount of text it can handle (or generate?). The article has gone through a wave of changing how it annotates its references and then uses this {{invoke}} trick, ignoring the problems it causes for verifiability.
That the workaround is necessary is a bug: an undesired limitation in functionality. The house of cards that implements -- templates, invoke, LUA scripts, code in the parser, ... -- is Byzantine and falls over easily when stressed. This is just one such article with problems.
Verifiability is one of the fundamental tenets of the encyclopedia, but the Wiki itself makes it extremely difficult to implement. The main page (and its sub features like "In the News") should not be used to showcase articles that are struggling with the parser implementation. Particularly for pages that cover sensitive and controversial subjects and must rely on easy verifiability to maintain balance and objectivity.
And so I reiterate my Strongly oppose not-vote. -- mikeblas (talk) 21:16, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Mikeblas: I am not sure if you checked the page again after recent edits. Your comment may be outdated.

However, I am still not seeing any Category:Harv_and_Sfn_template_errors or any no-target errors. Another editor has confirmed these issues have been resolved [2]

Oppose: From the linked Reuters article (bolding by me): "The commission's 72-page legal analysis is the strongest U.N. finding to date but the body is independent and does not officially speak for the United Nations. The U.N. has not yet used the term 'genocide' but is under increasing pressure to do so." Cambalachero (talk) 17:33, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The altblurbs specify that it is an independent commission, not the UN as a whole.
–DMartin 22:03, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I Support the Alt1 blurb as concise and accurate. This has been all over the world's main news outlets and is the news lede [3] for the BBC's "flagship international news and current affairs radio programme" Newshour (for example). The other similar determinations made for instance by B'Tselem, Amnesty International, and the Médecins Sans Frontières only give further weight to the UN Commission's determination; this assessment is reflected in the editorial decisions of global newspapers to highlight their findings on their front pages. Our decision should disregard clearly false arguments that the report fails WP:ITNSIGNIF (belied by international reporting) or that the article has WP:V arguments, already resolved on the talk page. -Darouet (talk) 18:10, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
You seem to fail to get what WP:ITNSIGNIF is about. International reporting is Necessary But Not Sufficient, a story also needs consensus. Many people have pointed that, although the blurb may suggest otherwise to the unaware reader, this body is not the UN nor what it says is an official UN view on the topic.
If you want to change that, you should explain if we got it wrong somehow and this Commission is really the big deal you seem to think it is. Cambalachero (talk) 18:47, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I'm glad you brought this up. The language of Alt1 is identical to that of the most reputable news organizations. The BBC states, "a UN investigation has concluded that Israel has committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza."[4] Compare that to Alt1: "A UN Commission of Inquiry has concluded Israel has committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza." I agree with you that an editor could be, personally, confused about what that means. But the UN investigation's findings are consistent with determinations of most international and Israeli human rights organizations, which are remarkably unified in their consensus. -Darouet (talk) 19:01, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support. Prefer alt1. The report was titled: "Legal analysis of the conduct of Israel in Gaza pursuant to the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide" [5] The inquiry was headed by Navi Pillay [6], president of International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda relevant to Rwandan genocide. I don't know what does not officially speak for the United Nations means. UN is composed of different countries. Some UN bodies or officials may refrain until an official ICJ ruling in several years. But I don't think that's a reason to omit this from the news. Alt1 says A UN Commission of Inquiry, it doesn't say "The UN". So I am not sure where the confusion is in. Bogazicili (talk) 19:35, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Comment: I have just tagged the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory article for lack of NPOV, and explained it at the talk page. In short, it only mentions what the reports say and never the criticisms of such reports, even when those criticisms are already in the news pieces being cited. Cambalachero (talk) 19:36, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

–DMartin 22:06, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The article in Ongoing is Gaza war.
This uses the word genocide 62 times, it has a substantial paragraph about it in the lead and extensive coverage in the body including details of this particular report.
So, it's already much better covered by Ongoing than other issues such as protests. Andrew🐉(talk) 22:43, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

I lean towards oppose for now. This is an independent investigation body from the UN.

When the UN accept the findings, then it would be more significant.--ZKang123 (talk · contribs) 10:41, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose Independent commission that notably does not speak for the UN, nor does it claim to, makes claim regarding a war that several others agencies have already made. This feels more like an attempt to right a great wrong or be a WikiActivist. Not notable enough on its own; falls under ongoing regardless. Cheers, atque supra!

Oppose on quality. While I disagree with the article's orange tag (since the given sources claimed to be selectively used give relatively little prominence to the Israeli criticism and more would be WP:UNDUE), the article still mostly just presents the commission's reports (and briefly discusses criticism by Israel and the US), without much about the context, how the commission operates, its relationship with the UN, etc. Chaotic Enby (talk · contribs) 14:25, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I presume you are referring to the article on the commission? The altblurbs only bold link Gaza genocide, which seems in excellent shape. If you don't like the other bold link, would you support alt1? Modest Genius talk 15:20, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
My bad, didn't catch that the altblurbs changed the bolded links.

While civilian casualties are common in war, it is abundantly clear that is not what is happening here. I'm honestly not sure about this nomination specifically, but continuing to sweep up all of what is happening into the heading of "Gaza War" seems to be carrying water for Israel. Hamas military engagement is a rather trivial component of the ongoing crisis. GreatCaesarsGhost 15:12, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
A trivial component of news coverage, perhaps, but a significant component of why the war continues. If Hamas were to release the hostages, that would merit an ITN nomination. Coining (talk) 18:12, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Oppose As much as it pains me to say it, this is unfortunately a situation where "in other news, water is wet" applies. There has been a fairly longstanding consensus amongst the world's authorities and scholars on human rights and genocide studies that this was the case. One additional UN commission adding its voice to that consensus is notable and merits coverage on Wikipedia, but at the same time, it is not so independently newsworthy as to escape the fact that this is otherwise captured by ongoing.

Wait/Oppose Borrowing the words of Masem from the previous time this happened:
If this wasn't a cartel vessel and turns out the US hit a civilian ship, as to start a larger conflict, that might be a reason to post, but there's no indication that anything has been massively escalated due to this. Currently, I feel this lacks any impact to post. 5.57.242.223 (talk) 15:38, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

I just noticed 2025 US Caribbean naval deployment is the target article for this blurb. Wouldn't 2025 United States strikes on Venezuelan boats be a better target article seeing how the article focuses on the strikes themselves rather than just describing them in passing like 2025 US Caribbean naval deployment does?

I feel the focus here is less about the results and more on the race's disruption by the protestors, given that the race itself isn't ITNR and best as I can tell hasn't been posted before. Masem (t) 14:08, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Support usually this wouldn't meet WP:ITNSIGNIF as not usually as much coverage as the Tour de France. But exceedingly more coverage this year due to 3 stages cancelled/shortened due to protests, so this event meets WP:ITNSIGNIF. And article quality is fine. Joseph2302 (talk) 14:24, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Strong support per Joseph; this is getting enough coverage to be worthy of being put in the news. Also, let’s put “Vuelta a España” in bold, per 2604’s vote (which is now deleted). 64.114 etc 15:44, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Just a procedural note that I deleted the IP vote due to ECR - given the context of the race’s cancellations/protests, I figured it fell under the ARBPIA area enough for ECR to be in effect. The Kip (contribs) 16:02, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
What is ECR? 64.114 etc 16:03, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

@64.114 etc The broadly-construed (i.e. anything even tangentially related) WP:ARBPIA area is subject to the extended-confirmed restriction, meaning that an editor has to be logged-in and extended-confirmed (account age of at least 30 days + at least 500 edits) in order to edit articles/content related to the Arab–Israeli (more often just Israeli–Palestinian) conflict.

Oppose per The Kip. The protests aren't in themselves notable enough for ITN, and we don't post the Vuelta either. I don't think combining the two things makes this suddenly big enough news. Maybe a good candidate for a DYK listing.  — Amakuru (talk) 20:59, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

+1, there are plenty of sporting events that get posted due to the notability of a particular event despite not being ITN/R!
Turini2 (talk) 07:13, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose as per The Kip. The race itself is not ITNR and the protests are covered by ongoing. --MtPenguinMonster (talk) 23:26, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support The race not being ITNR is not really relevant, as sporting events which are not ITNR can still successfully pass the criteria independently. Also, I don't think a bike race in Spain with pro-Palestine protests is so proximate to the Gaza war that it is 100% covered by ongoing. Because neither of those factors are dispositive, that leads me to conclude this can be posted. The protests together with general hype around Jonas Vingegaard have pushed it over the line; this is evidenced by the widespread international coverage as well as domestic political attention. FlipandFlopped ㋡ 03:41, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Flipandflopped there’s generally been a consensus that Gaza war protests fall under the Gaza war ongoing item. The Kip (contribs) 13:20, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
And I agree with that general consensus, but this is at the intersection of Gaza protests, Spanish politics, and a sports event which was already bordering on newsworthy enough to blurb, so I think it clears the bar. FlipandFlopped ㋡ 05:21, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support This is a Grand Tour comparable with the Tour de France and the protests seem to have been quite disruptive.
The ongoing entry isn't much help as finding this would be a needle in a haystack, buried deep down in huge secondary articles like Gaza War protests. Andrew🐉(talk) 07:23, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Theoretically support alt blurb 1 or 2, but oppose for now Although the Vuelta a España isn’t ITNR, it looks like it’s about as important as the Tour de France & these protests make this edition of the Vuelta a España more notable than other editions. However, the “Final stage in Madrid” section describes the protests as anti-genocide protests when English language sources don’t describe them as anti-genocide protests, so I have NPOV concerns about that section. Blaylockjam10 (talk) 00:07, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
This section has now been updated to a more neutral POV e.g. demonstrations against the Gaza war rather than "demonstrations against the genocide in Gaza" Turini2 (talk) 12:19, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

It is incredibly rude to call a AGF nomination of a major sports results as "trivia". If you don't like sports, fine, but sports results are something we post commonly, and we do not require a sports results to be ITNR to be posted. That said, where we do have multiple ITNR for a specific sport, the posting of a non-ITNR sports results can be seen as lacking the significance as those listed at ITN.

Oppose on notability Results from the most significant sporting events may warrant a blurb; this isn't one of them. Dr Fell (talk) 22:43, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Comment Not sure why people considers this championship trivial since no reasoning was given in either case. I'm not sure either why it's not on the ITN/R list seeing how it's a reoccurring championship that is held every four years. That said, I concur with Howard the Duck in that the EuroBasket 2025 final should be the target article as with most other championship blurbs. I feel either article is not ready as the former has sourcing issues and the article about the final lacks prose. 5.57.242.223 (talk) 09:25, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose on notability and quality pretty sure this gets nominated most years, and rejected. Don't see coverage to meet WP:ITNQUALITY. And I certainly see no match summary prose on EuroBasket 2025 (the only reasonable target bold article- strongly oppose ALT0 with player listed in bold, as they're not the main focus of the event).

LOL we've posted more boat races than boxing fights in the last 10 years? Howard the Duck (talk) 13:38, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Boxing is difficult because there's nothing like a championship series, only various title matches to determine who the belt-holder is in a given weight class. That's where here, that multiple sources saying having the title in three different weight classes makes this significant. Masem (t) 16:24, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
There are more boxing title fights in a month that boat races in a decade, but we still have posted more boat races than boxing fights in the past 10 years, despite the fact we haven't posted boat races for years now (LOL). Howard the Duck (talk) 16:29, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Exactly that there are that many title fights in a month is why its hard to see what makes sense to post for boxing, because of how routine title fights are. This case is different, due to the multiple titles now held by Crawford. (That s, this is news because of that achievement, not because of the fight itself). Masem (t) 16:34, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

It's unclear why it was notable then, either. This seems more like pub trivia. I can't imagine a newspaper running this on a front page – or even as a lead story in the Sport section. Perhaps a candidate for a future Did You Know. Dr Fell (talk) 22:51, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Oppose. While certainly INTERESTING, I do believe "undisputed in three weight classes" is something that falls in the trivia category. And I don't get this claim that boxing is underrepresented at ITN - we literally posted the first undisputed heavyweight championship in years when Usyk won it the first time, IIRC. All due respect to Crawford and his accomplishment, but I don't think being the undisputed super middleweight champion has the same pomp, at the very least if we're going by what the public is interested in. DarkSide830 (talk) 16:58, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Weak Oppose Mostly on notability grounds.
Crawford was already champion, did this change anything? –DMartin 22:45, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Crawford was WBA light middleweight champion; Canelo Álvarez was the undisputed super middleweight champion, and the titles on the line were Álvarez's championships. What changed was Álvarez no longer champion, and Crawford is now the undisputed super middleweight champion, aside from being WBA light middleweight champion.

Support - new record in popular sport that hasn't been achieved in 90 years; article of decent quality. — Knightoftheswords 13:52, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support I will quote myself from the Usyk nom: "As a general rule, the top achievement in each sport should meet WP:ITNSIGNIF. Boxing is certainly as popular as many of the sports we post, but with the myriad titles and classes, it can be difficult to specify which achievement merits posting. However, when this problem impacts other sports, we have addressed it with more posts: 3 per year for marathons, 4.5 for golf, 4 for horse races and 7 total for the two codes of rugby. Crowning a new undisputed champ seems to be as good a standard as any for boxing. By my count, this is the 12th occurrence across classes in the last 5 years. I think that's a pretty good sweet spot in terms of posting frequency." The opposes here seem focused on the fact that Crawford is champion across several weight classes, which should amplify his accomplishment not detract from it.

(Post)Alternative blurb: ​ Australia and Papua New Guinea sign a mutual defense treaty that will integrate the Australian Defence Force and the Papua New Guinea Defence Force. News source(s): Australia and Papua New Guinea to 'totally integrate' military in defence treaty, minister saysCredits:
Updated and nominated by Chipmunkdavis (talk · give credit)
Article updatedNominator's comments: Substantial and unusual announcement of a "totally" integrated military, even allowing for potential ministerial hyperbole. Both militaries will be able to hire the others' citizens. The agreement comes in the context of growing competition for influence in the Pacific with China, as well as with the symbolic 50th anniversary of one country's independence from the other. This story will go on for a couple of days, with formal signing expected in the next day or two. (The agreement itself probably sits on the edge of notability at the moment, will likely become much more firmly notable in the near future.) CMD (talk) 20:17, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose Good faith nom, however there are some issues I have with this nomination; A) the target article is not directly primarily about the subject. I feel personally that ITN blurbs should target either the dedicated articles about the subject/event of the blurb or have substantial focus of the subject/event. There is currently relatively little prose about the announcement in the target article. B) I feel most treaty signings/announcements in general are a bit run of the mill to blurb C) relatively low impact/coverage globally. 5.57.243.123 (talk) 21:40, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Support in principle, but wait until full treaty details are revealed — The integration of two militaries, recruitment permitted from either side, along with a pathway to citizenship. I would change the blurb though: "strengthen ties" doesn't mean anything in particular, and "ahead of the latter's independence anniversary" is trivia. A better altblurb could come up the details of the treaty are released. Nice4What (talk · contribs) – (Thanks ♥) 23:13, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Not saying it has to be in the blurb, but the independence anniversary is not trivia but part of the story. The treaty is being specifically timed for the event, no doubt part of both countries weaving that narrative of how ties remain close past independence etc. CMD (talk) 08:10, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The timing is not necessarily important though; what is important is the military integration. The blurb will survive without this tidbit of information. Altblurb1 suggested. Nice4What (talk · contribs) – (Thanks ♥) 13:38, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Strong oppose the current blurb if nothing else. Considering the population of the United Kingdom is in the range of 60,000,000, 110,000,000 seems a bit of an odd estimate to me. The article cited in the page 2025 British anti-immigration protests cites 100,000. I want to see an article for Unite the Kingdom be created, or for there to be more than a one paragraph update at the target on it. Departure– (talk) 16:26, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
There was an article, but it seems to have vanished. I can only assume the current offical estimate of 110k has been put out because it sounds less scary than the "more than 100,000" that your cite actually says. Worth noting that London itself has under 10 million people, and the biggest ever march in London was probably the 1.5 million who opposed the Iraq War. But 110k is not exactly small, and it definitely feels significant that they now outnumber the counter protesters by 20 to 1. It would be helpful to know why. 82.132.187.52 (talk) 16:51, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose While large in size, this seems to have lacked any significant impact - non-violent (good), no expected change yet as a result (compared to, for example, the Nepal protests). Masem (t) 17:04, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
That's not how UK politics/protest works. The significance is the size, specifically that in the eyes of the organizers it has been a huge success (true mass attendance, headline news, failure of the counter protest). You will never see a UK Prime Minister stand down or change policy under these circumstances. Arguably he already made a significant change to satisfy them, he just did it before the protest actually happened. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce9rg9jj5kro Do not compare Nepal (or America) to the UK, they are (wildly) different countries. 82.132.187.163 (talk) 18:30, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
There is pretty much some protest going on somewhere in the world at any time, we have to be selective of what protests make sense to post to avoid ITN from becoming a protest tracker. A large but otherwise non-violent protest is very low on importance, compared to one that has caused an entire govt to collapse. Masem (t) 18:46, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
It doesn’t sound like you've put much thought into this at all. Would I be wrong in assuming you don't really have the first clue who Tommy Robinson, Nigel Farage, Shabana Mahmood or Kier Starmer even are? If the answer is no, then respectfully, please recognise you're probably not qualified to even give an opinion on what is and is not a significant protest in the UK. Your entire comment is inapplicable to the UK context - neither the poll tax protests of the 1990s or the Iraq War protests of the 2000s led to a change of government. But most will identify those as the two most significant political protests in recent UK history. Neither led to any immediate consequences, because that's not the British way of doing things. The day a mass protest in the UK leads to an immediate change in government, is the day Wikipedia will be completely irrelevant, because that will surely be the day something will have gone seriously wrong in the UK at large. Unimaginably wrong. 82.132.187.163 (talk) 19:39, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Anyone is allowed to voice their opinion at an open discussion of a matter like this and regionalism being used to gatekeep consensus building of such by suggesting someone outside of the area is "probably not qualified to even give an opinion" is not helpful in the slightest. Masem has a good point here, in my opinion, regardless of their knowledge of UK politics. The same argument could be used for a similar protest anywhere else in the world, because the substance of the argument is the same regardless of the specific people it concerns. Departure– (talk) 19:53, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
How is it a good point? Unless I have misunderstood it, it's a de facto ban on considering any political protest significant if it occurred in a non-violent politically stable country. Which is obviously nonsense because this is an encyclopedia where all countries are equally relevant, not a tabloid which only concerns itself with eye catching chaotic countries. Who benefits from this approach? Masem can't even answer that if he has absolutely no idea how many times his argument will have meant a politically significant protest in the UK has been rejected by Wikipedia. 82.132.187.163 (talk) 21:13, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
My point is that there are far too many protests that occur on a routine basis that to give any protest that lacks any clear and immediate impact a space on ITN would be too low of a bar and would lead to us likely to post protests on a nearly-daily basis. ITN is not a newspaper and is meant to feature quality articles that reflect the coverage in the news, and for the most part, non-violent protests tend to get minimal news treatment (even locally), whereas those with immediate effects often get far wider coverage that justifies the reason to post them.
This is nothing about UK politics, because the same is true for US politics or EU politics or the like. Masem (t) 23:34, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I'm going to add that at this stage the protests are still not ITN, but they are also still occurring with some heating up (a dozen some ppl arrested today). It could turn worse at which point that would become more likely as an ITN. Masem (t) 13:20, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Oppose. Notably large and yet another indicator of an ideological shift in Great Britain, but large political rallies are rarely if ever prominent enough for ITN.
Nepal’s “protests” were destructive riots followed by an overthrow of government. UtK is unlikely to be an inflection point. Current Events is the right home for this. Dr Fell (talk) 18:33, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Why are people even comparing this protest to what happened in Nepal? It's nonsense. There are sound reasons to believe this is already an era defining inflection point in UK politics, induced by protests. It stands in stark contrast to how this and other recent governments have reacted to mass but peaceful protests. This exact government has already flatly refused to give in to several rallies held for gaza, climate, welfare and tax policy. Their response to this movement is different. They're in an existential crisis, with Reform UK having already effectively destroyed the other mainstream UK party. There's the significance, for anyone who doesn't really understand the subtleties of how things now work in this peaceful two party democracy in a post-2008 world. Perhaps because they're numbed to the chaos of Trump's America, or the general violence seen elsewhere. This is not normal. The complete failure of the counter protest, is the truly scary part. That's new. 82.132.187.163 (talk) 20:20, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Because the events in Nepal quickly and directly led to a change in government. This isn't a venue to discuss politics only the notability of events. If UtK results in Starmer making a notable concession to the demands of the protesters or if it results in a collapse of his government, those events could be worth an ITN item. (I don’t see how Starmer can shift much to the right before he starts losing MPs to the fledgling Your Party.) There has to be a notable event for this to be featured news. The Met estimate is 110,000 attendees. I've seen reports that the actual number is higher but cannot find a reliable source with a solid estimate. The Iraq War protest in 2003 had over a million in attendance. The UtK rally would need numbers that high to be significant enough on its own to warrant mention. Or it would need to produce a significant political development – policy concession, MP defections in large numbers, leadership challenge, general election called, etc. Finally, to use somewhat fiery language, the 2025 British anti-immigration protests article that would be linked to is in a sorry state. Rather than documenting the event and offering balanced analysis, it’s overtly biased. Dr Fell (talk) 21:37, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Comment As of now, Unite the Kingdom rally is a redirect to the page 2025 British anti-immigration protests, but there is no prose on the 13 September rally outside the lede, itself uncited. Departure– (talk) 18:58, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose The No Kings protest saw a higher percentage of the country and a higher total number of people protest, and it wasn't posted. Protests only become notable enough for ITN when they lead to immediate change or some sort of riot, and until that happens, it won't be posted. Elipticon (talk) 20:18, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Whoever decided that should be the rule, is an idiot. It's a de facto ban on noting any significant political protests in the UK. I can't think of a single protest in recent UK history that would ever meet this ridiculous criteria, biased as it is toward violent and politically unstable chaotic countries. And for what purpose? Only a fool would think UK politics is not something the readers of Wikipedia are interested in, surely. The country has never felt less politically stable, and that's saying something given what happened in the last decade with Brexit etc. 82.132.187.163 (talk) 20:41, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Oppose, another nothing-burger in the grand scheme of immigration-related news in the UK. No change of government, no deaths, no widespread massive chaos.. not really worthy for ITN. Kline • talk • contribs 21:27, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
What a ridiculous opinion. People must be off their heads if they genuinely think the UK would change its government due to a peaceful protest of even this size. When the hell has that even happened? They must be barking mad if it genuinely takes people dying before Wikipedia should deem a "protest" to be significant. The word is PROTEST, not riot or revolution. Similarly if they want to see widespread chaos. The UK isn't France, it is perfectly possible for 100,000 people to make their opinions known without bringing the country to a halt. What you moronically call a "nothing burger" is a very large protest speaking to a very major issue that everyone here is hoping doesn’t get so badly handled it leads to a change of government any time soon, because that would be very very bad. But at least then, when the violence really erupts and centuries of political orthodoxy is overturned, maybe then you might deem it worthy. At which point, who the hell would care anyway? How self important do you people really imagine you are, if you assume a world where a country as important as the UK is, is in such dire straits over such an explosive issue that there is widespresd chaos and deaths and changes in government, anyone would still have the time or inclination to bother with Wikipedia at all? If the UK government is ever toppled by a mass march, that would probably be about the same time the USA is in a full scale civil war. So good luck with that. Hard to keep charity funded servers online in such a scenario, I would have thought. 82.132.186.240 (talk) 23:39, 13 September 2025 (UTC) Stuck!, Harassment to the editor.ROY is WAR Talk! 10:25, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Recent deaths of any person, animal or organism with a Wikipedia article are always presumed to be important enough to post (see this RFC and further discussion). Comments should focus on whether the quality of the article meets WP:ITNRD.Nominator's comments: Australian basketball player. Well sourced. Natg 19 (talk) 17:12, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support, article looks well-sourced. Looks like it's good to go.

Article needs updatingNominator's comments: I couldn't easily find if we had a separate article on this trial. Masem (t) 19:16, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
We have 2022 Brazilian coup plot which covers the trial, and should be linked in the blurb. Suggesting/support altblurb 1. Nice4What (talk · contribs) – (Thanks ♥) 19:18, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Thanks, I've made that swap of target and used that alt blurb for the main. Masem (t) 19:23, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Minor but should it be "convicts [...] of" rather than "for"? Dr Fell (talk) 20:15, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support Internationally covered, landmark ruling with possible political ramifications in the country, and I'd always support the convicting of former/current heads of state/government. Article seems to be in good shape and updated. --TDKR Chicago 101 (talk) 19:37, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support as per TDKR. 64.114 etc 19:43, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I oppose. Conviction is not sentence. I'm keeping up with it minute by minute, and the sentence should come out only tomorrow, so the time he will be imprisoned has not yet been defined. ArionStar (talk) 19:49, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The conviction has always been the point we consider the point of posting. If the sentence is tomorrow, we can update the blurb with it but there's no reason to wait for that. Masem (t) 19:53, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
With the update, the blurb would be posted as a September 12 event, not September 11. We should wait. No rush, please. ArionStar (talk) 19:59, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Given that the sentence was known to happen soon, sure. But normally, sentencing in cases like this comes weeks to months later, which is why we have nearly always posted at conviction, not sentencing, when the story is actually in te news. Masem (t) 22:29, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
In the meantime, it's virtually September 12 already, as this debate continues. I see no need to wait, when we can edit it later today. Nfitz (talk) 23:44, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support There is nothing more to wait for. ArionStar (talk) 01:01, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support after sentencing. Clearly significant event in the evolution of Brazil’s democracy and will entirely upend next autumn’s presidential election. Dr Fell (talk) 20:07, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support after sentencing I agree with Dr. Fell's reasoning. NewishIdeas (talk) 20:21, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support after sentencing per all above. Obviously notable event. The Kip (contribs) 20:43, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
SIince there seems to be agreement to wait fir the sentence that is supposed to happen tomorrow, I've added an alt blurb to fill in the terms of sentence once known. I urge editors to still review the article in the meantime for quality and update. Masem (t) 20:47, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support (with a day's delay, if that's consensus). Alt-2 suggested, to avoid three "Brazilians" in the blurb. Moscow Mule (talk) 21:32, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
No idea why sentencing is considered more important here. We have always posted convictions, and rarely posted sentencings, as convictions are what is in the news. Moot Support posting now, as this is a major story (but no issue in waiting a day or two). Natg 19 (talk)
Also added alt 3 which combines the conviction and sentencing. Natg 19 (talk) 22:02, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support altblurb2 for conciseness. --MtPenguinMonster (talk) 23:32, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support - When's the last time you've seen a leader of a country sentenced to this many years in prison. Onegreatjoke (talk) 02:00, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support alternative blurb iii Article seems to be in okay shape. Major political news in Brazil, also legal confirmation a coup was attempted. Bremps... 02:01, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The sentencing process ended (27 years and 3 months). Érico (talk) 22:15, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
CNN confirms, have updated blurbs. Masem (t) 22:24, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support altblurb2, significant and major coverage. I did not spot any glaring issues of the target article from a quick readthrough. Edit: altblurb1 -> altblurb2 5.57.243.123 (talk) 22:40, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose: The trial of Bolsonaro has been already posted Cambalachero (talk) 23:30, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
That wasn't a trial, @Cambalachero. That was merely a political restriction - not a criminal trial. The trial didn't even begin until a few days ago! Nfitz (talk) 23:47, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
In addition to what Nfitz pointed out, the consequences of these decisions are very different. Previously, he was barred from running for office for eight years. Now he is sentenced to 27 years in prison. There is a big difference between those two restrictions/sentences. I don't see this story as a "repeat" of the previous one, even if it might build on the previous 2023 story in some way. 98.170.164.88 (talk) 23:52, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Distinction without a difference. It's about Bolsonaro's legal woes either way, and over the same stuff to boot (they are not two unrelated cases over different things). The point is, this story has already been posted, and only details changed. Cambalachero (talk) 00:42, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Political ineligibility of Jair Bolsonaro ≠ Conviction of Bolsonaro. ArionStar (talk) 01:04, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Huge difference. And how many times do we post Trump's frequent convictions and various aspects of the Israeli war. Nfitz (talk) 01:04, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
If I found out I couldn't run for the presidency of Brazil, I'd be somewhat upset. I think I would be a little more so if I were sentenced to three decades in prison. Bremps... 02:02, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Support The conviction of once-prominent president of one of the largest and most significant countries on earth is extremely notable! Nfitz (talk) 23:49, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Posted - Fuzheado | Talk 02:40, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Fuzheado: the article AP 2668 was created. ArionStar (talk) 03:24, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
There are two major orange tags on there. When it gets more substantial and higher quality, perhaps we can link to it. - Fuzheado | Talk 03:33, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Fuzheado:  Done. The target article is Jair Bolsonaro, too. ArionStar (talk) 05:47, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I'm not sure I understand the "langx" template in the first sentence, but "Ação Penal" is red linked, so it seems not ready for publication. Need to fix before it's ready. - Fuzheado | Talk 10:50, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Fuzheado:  Done. ArionStar (talk) 14:46, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Perhaps you can propose a revised blurb with proper links and bolding, as I am not confident I am familiar enough with the specifics. Thanks. - Fuzheado | Talk 14:49, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Also, it may be good to link in that court case to more places, especially this navigation box: Template:2022_Brazilian_general_election.
- Fuzheado | Talk 14:51, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Fuzheado: "The Supreme Federal Court convicts former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro to 27 years in prison for involvement in the 2022 Brazilian coup plot". Because there's no sentence read yet. ArionStar (talk) 14:57, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Done - Please double check to make sure it is accurate. - Fuzheado | Talk 15:28, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
You shouldn't switch what is the target article without gaining consensus on its quality first. Its fine to link the trial article without bolding, but we'd need discussion to consider it as featured. Masem (t) 15:32, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
What Masem said. The "supports" above were for the coup article to be bolded, which provides a much better introduction to the topic for those who might not have been following this news. Moscow Mule (talk) 17:34, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
That's getting into the weeds (that they haven't actual read the sentence to him and the post-reading dealings that might go on to reduce it).
Also, the coup plot article is far better quality than the trial article, though it can still be linked, just not bolded. Masem (t) 15:29, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The plot article has issues, while his personal article hasn’t. ArionStar (talk) 15:47, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Fuzheado: convicted, not sentenced yet. ArionStar (talk) 02:00, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Every reliable source says he's been sentenced, even if a formal reading and onset of the sentence hasn't been started. Masem (t) 03:22, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Recent deaths of any person, animal or organism with a Wikipedia article are always presumed to be important enough to post (see this RFC and further discussion). Comments should focus on whether the quality of the article meets WP:ITNRD.Nominator's comments: Chinese actor. Unfortunate death. – robertsky (talk) 13:22, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Oppose Needs a full rewrite; currently just WP:PROSELINE and charts. GreatCaesarsGhost 15:37, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Not Ready, career section needs restructuring, and should have early life section, if possible. Other than that everything else looks good, sourcing of prose, filmography, and discography are great, and death section has a lot of depth. V. L. Mastikosa (talk) 00:40, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Ready?: Far from perfect but I think of sufficent quality for ITN.
–DMartin 23:02, 15 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
A few missed citations are okay, but less than half of the works are referenced here. GreatCaesarsGhost 12:45, 17 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Comment No citation for DOB. Filmography and discography need more citations. Curbon7 (talk) 01:08, 16 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
References[edit]
Nominators often include links to external websites and other references in discussions on this page. It is usually best to provide such links using the inline URL syntax [http://example.com] rather than using <ref></ref> tags, because that keeps all the relevant information in the same place as the nomination without having to jump to this section, and facilitates the archiving process.
