Tim Whelan (November 2, 1893 – August 12, 1957) was an American film director, writer, producer and actor, best remembered for his writing credits on Harold Lloyd and Harry Langdon comedies, and for directing mostly British films, such as The Thief of Bagdad (1940).[2]
In Britain he worked with leading production companies including British International Pictures, Gainsborough Pictures and Alexander Korda's London Films. In the United States he was employed by MGM and RKO. He returned to America following the outbreak of the Second World War, but came back to Britain for a film in 1948, This Was a Woman.
He was married to the film actress Miriam Seegar in 1932. Whelan died at his home in Beverly Hills.[3]
