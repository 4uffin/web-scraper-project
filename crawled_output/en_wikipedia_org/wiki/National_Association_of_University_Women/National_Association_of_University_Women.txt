The National Association of University Women (NAUW), founded in 1910, is a non-profit organization with a mission to "serve women, youth, and the disadvantaged in our communities and in developing countries by addressing educational issues, and strategically partnering with allied organizations."
History[edit]
The organization was founded in 1910 in Washington, D.C., with the original name of the College Alumnae Club. The organization's original founders were Mary Church Terrell, Nancy Fairfax Brown, Sara Winifred Brown, and Mary Cromwell.[1][2]
In 1923, the organization was expanded and renamed as the National Association of College Women (NACW).[3] In 1974, the organization updated its charter and was renamed to the National Association of University Women (NAUW).[1]
The organization is composed of African American college and university women graduates and is affiliated with the National Council of Negro Women, National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, United Negro College Fund, National Coalition for Literacy, and the American Council on Education.[4][5][6]
