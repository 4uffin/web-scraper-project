From top to bottom, left to right: the Second Italo-Ethiopian War begins as Italy invades Ethiopia, signaling growing tensions in Europe and Africa; the Nuremberg Laws are enacted in Nazi Germany, depriving Jews of citizenship and basic rights and cementing the regime’s racial policies; the 1935 Greek coup attempt unfolds in March but is swiftly suppressed, highlighting political instability in Greece; the 1935 Yangtze flood devastates large parts of China, killing tens of thousands and displacing millions; the Harlem riot of 1935 breaks out in New York City, the city’s first modern race riot, reflecting deep social and racial tensions; and the 1935 Labor Day hurricane strikes the Florida Keys with unprecedented force, becoming one of the most intense hurricanes in U.S. history.
