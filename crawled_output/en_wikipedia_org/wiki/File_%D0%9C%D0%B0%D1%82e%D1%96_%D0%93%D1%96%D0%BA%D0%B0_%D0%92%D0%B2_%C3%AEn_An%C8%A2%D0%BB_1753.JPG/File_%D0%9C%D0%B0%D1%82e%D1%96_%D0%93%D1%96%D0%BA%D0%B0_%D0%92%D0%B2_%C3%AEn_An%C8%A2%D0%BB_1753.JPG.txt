Summary
DescriptionМатeі Гіка Вв în AnȢл 1753.JPG

The Wallachian Prince Matei Ghica. Reproduction of a painting from Pantelimon Monastery, Bucharest, which is in turn a reconstruction of Ghica's likeness from a church fresco, dating back to 1753. The inscription headlining the painting is in a late variant of "transitional" Romanian Cyrillic, mixing Slavonic and Latin lettering. It reads: Матeі Гіка Вв în AnȢл 1753 ("Matei Gika V[oi]v[ode] in the Year 1753").
