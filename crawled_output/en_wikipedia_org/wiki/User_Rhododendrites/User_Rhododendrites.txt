From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Active on English Wikipedia and Wikimedia Commons; occasional user of other Wikimedia projects (Wikidata, Meta, etc.). Leave a message or feel free to email.
Wikipedian for quite a while now. Mainly as a researcher for the first few years. Then I started teaching with Wikipedia and finally jumped into [very] active editing in 2013. I tend to edit in a wide variety of topic areas. In fact, as I think about it, it's hard to point to topic area concentrations.
In addition to the s linked at the top of the page, here are some fun ones
guerilla gardening group who threw "seed grenades" into empty lots on the Lower East Side
site of a chocolate flood
site of a wine flood
first human cannonball
fictional order or mammals with diversely functional noses
largest ship graveyard in Rhode Island
mandarin duck who became a minor celebrity in Central Park
"the bug lady" of the American Museum of Natural History, also known for origami
the most trafficked animal in the world
first woman engineer at NASA
variant of chess where the pieces "explode"
myth of foreign ships being invisible to natives
little drawings of flies or bees in urinals
NYC's only wildlife hospital
art video game about marriage
when crime and corruption caused a third of the population or Rhode Island to lose access to their bank accounts
event space that almost burned down due to an eel in a fire hose, and later made "all your dreams come true" before it was demolished
one of the most successful jingle music groups in mid-20th century Chicago
devices used by people living in areas of conflict or under oppressive regimes to create pirate radio stations
social movement archive
compilation of psychedelic Cambodian rock music from just before the Khmer Rouge
former squat called the Batcave
cybernetic meadows...
landfill that a lot of people in Rhode Island think is the tallest point in the state (it's not though)
oldest nut company in the US, makers of ubiquitous displays of blue-packaged nuts/fruit
someone who led bird walks in Central Park for 40 years
how listening to music via headphones gives you a greater sense of control over your environment
one of the earliest sorta-kinda encyclopedias
beloved public bathroom
online black market
destroying ivory as an elephant conservation approach
journalistic technique for handling misinformation
dog memorialized in Green-Wood Cemetery
I tend to edit in waves, focusing on adding content for a while, then going into maintenance mode for a while. If you don't see me around here, there's a good chance I'm active over on Commons, or out in the world trying to take pictures for Commons.
I'm involved with WikiNYC and engage in a variety of Wikipedia-related activities both online and offline. Leave me a message if you want to talk about Wikipedia research, Wikipedia in education, or New York-area events/partnerships.
