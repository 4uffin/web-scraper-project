Frederick Edwin (born 19 February 1985) is an Indonesian businessman and politician who has served as regent of West Kutai Regency, East Kalimantan since February 2025.
Early life[edit]
Frederick Edwin was born on 19 February 1985 in Samarinda as the youngest son of Ismail Thomas and Lusia Mayo Thomas.[1] Ismail Thomas served two terms as West Kutai's regent between 2006 and 2016, and was a member of the House of Representatives from 2019 to 2023 when he was removed for a corruption case.[2] Edwin completed middle and high school at the W.R. Soepratman school in Samarinda, graduating from high school in 2002.[3]
Career[edit]
After completing his studies, Edwin began to enter business, eventually having interests in mining, bottled drinking water, and hotels.[3]
In 2024, Edwin contested West Kutai's regency election, selecting municipal civil servant Nanang Adriani as his running mate.[4] The ticket received the support of a coalition of 11 parties led by the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle,[5] which Edwin is a member of.[6] In the ensuing three-way election, Edwin and Adriani placed first after securing 37,282 votes (39.6%).[7] One of the competing candidates' running mates, Alexander Edmond, is Edwin's older brother.[8] Edwin and Adriani were sworn in as regent and vice regent on 20 February 2025, along with most other regional leaders elected in 2024.[9]
As a regent, Edwin has pushed for the strengthening of roads connecting West Kutai to the neighboring regencies of Mahakam Ulu and Kutai Kartanegara, which had previously required annual maintenance.[10] He also increased scholarship funding for basic education from the municipal budget, from Rp 600 million (USD 40,000) to Rp 3 billion (USD 200,000) in 2025.[11]
Personal life[edit]
Edwin is a Catholic. He married Maria Christiana Mozes on 19 February 2020, hosting a wedding attended by over 1,000 people.[12]
