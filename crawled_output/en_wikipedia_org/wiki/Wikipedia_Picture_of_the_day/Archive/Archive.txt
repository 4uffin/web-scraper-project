The Australian brushturkey (Alectura lathami) is a species of bird in the Megapode family, Megapodiidae. It is found in eastern Australia, from Far North Queensland to the South Coast region of New South Wales, as well as on Kangaroo Island in South Australia, where it is an introduced species. The Australian brushturkey inhabits wet forests, as well as drier scrubs and open areas, and lives in both mountainous and lowland areas. It is also common in urban environments including on domestic properties in the cities of Brisbane and Sydney. A black-feathered bird with a red head, the Australian brushturkey is typically a large bird, with a total length of around 60–75 cm and a wingspan of around 85 cm, although the subspecies A. l. purpureicollis from the northern Cape York Peninsula is somewhat smaller. The species is known for its mound-building, which is carried out by a dominant male and visited by a succession of local females, for mating and egg-laying. It uses a large nest on the ground made of leaves, other compostable material, and earth. This female Australian brushturkey was photographed in Crater Lakes National Park, Queensland.

The Freshman
is a 1925 American silent comedy film that tells the story of a college freshman trying to become popular by joining the school football team. It was released on September 20, 1925, and stars Harold Lloyd, Jobyna Ralston, Brooks Benedict, and James Anderson. It remains one of Lloyd's most successful and enduring films. The film was written by John Grey, Sam Taylor, Tim Whelan, and Ted Wilde. It was directed by Taylor and Fred C. Newmeyer. In 1990, The Freshman was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant," added in the second year of voting and one of the first 50 films to receive the honor.

The little pied cormorant (Microcarbo melanoleucos) is a species of waterbird in the cormorant family, Phalacrocoracidae. It is a common bird found around the coasts, islands, estuaries and inland waters of Australia, New Guinea, New Zealand, Timor-Leste and Indonesia, and around the islands of the south-western Pacific and the subantarctic. Measuring 56 to 58 centimetres (22 to 23 inches) in length with a short bill, it is usually black above and white below with a yellow bill and small crest, although a mostly black, white-throated form predominates in New Zealand. This little pied cormorant was photographed in Freycinet National Park in Tasmania, Australia.

The Battle of Antietam took place during the American Civil War on September 17, 1862, between Confederate General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia and Union Major General George B. McClellan's Army of the Potomac near Sharpsburg, Maryland, and Antietam Creek. Part of the Maryland campaign, it was the first field army–level engagement in the Eastern theater of the American Civil War to take place on Union soil. It remains the bloodiest day in American history, with a tally of 22,727 dead, wounded, or missing on both sides. Although the Union Army suffered heavier casualties than the Confederates, the battle was a major turning point in the Union's favor. This 1887 lithograph by Thure de Thulstrup depicts the charge of the Iron Brigade near the Dunker Church.

The Asaro Mudmen are a group of people in the Asaro River valley in the Eastern Highlands Province of Papua New Guinea who wear characteristic large decorative clay masks over their heads, accompanied by white body paint and long bamboo fingers. Likely inspired by traditional methods of obscuring faces during inter-tribal violence, researchers believe that the modern tradition of the Asaro Mudmen developed in the village of Komunive during the second half of the 20th century, first as a marker of village identity, and then as part of a significant tourism industry. Today, Mudmen imagery has become a cultural symbol for Asaro, the province, and to some extent the country as a whole. This Asaro Mudman carrying his clay mask on his shoulder was photographed in 2008 in the village of Kabiufa, part of the Asaro valley.

The 2024 Central European floods were a series of floods caused by a record heavy rainfall generated by Storm Boris, an extremely humid Genoa low. The flooding began in Austria and the Czech Republic, then spread to Poland, Romania and Slovakia, and then onwards to Germany and Hungary. The floods caused 28 fatalities and over 4 billion euros in damage. This photograph shows floodwater surrounding the Franciscan monastery in Kłodzko, Poland, on 15 September 2024.

The common ringed plover (Charadrius hiaticula) is a species of bird in the family Charadriidae. Its breeding range consists of much of northern Eurasia, as well as Greenland. It is a migratory bird and many individuals spend their winters in locations across Africa. Its breeding habitat is generally open ground on beaches or flats although some birds breed inland. They are commonly found both in low coastal plains and in cold uplands with sparse vegetation, in open habitats with little or no plant cover, where they nest on the ground. Breeding occurs from one year of age, with egg laying generally beginning around May. A clutch of three to four eggs is laid at intervals of one to three days, with the downy grey-buff chicks hatching after twenty-one to twenty-seven days. The common ringed plover forages for food on beaches, tidal flats and fields, usually by sight. It eats insects, crustaceans and worms, forages both by day and by night, and sometimes uses foot-trembling to reveal location of prey. This common ringed plover was photographed near Orkelsjøen, a lake in Oppdal, Norway.

The Austin J. Tobin Plaza was a large public square that was located on the World Trade Center site from 1966 until its destruction in 2001 during the September 11 attacks. It covered five acres (220,000 sq ft; 2.0 ha), making it the largest plaza in New York City by acreage at the time. The plaza opened as part of the original World Trade Center complex on April 4, 1973, and was renamed in 1982 after Austin J. Tobin, a former executive director of the Port of New York Authority. The plaza was damaged by a car bomb in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, and was destroyed by Islamist terrorists from al-Qaeda eight years later on September 11, 2001. This photograph, taken in 1976 by the Hungarian-American photographer Balthazar Korab, shows an elevated view of the Austin J. Tobin Plaza as seen from 5 World Trade Center. The Sphere and Ideogram, two of several public sculptures in the plaza, are visible in the image.

Plantago lanceolata, also known as the ribwort plantain, among other names, is a species of flowering plant in the plantain family Plantaginaceae. It is native to Europe and western Asia and has also been introduced elsewhere in the world, including North America, Oceania, Japan, South Africa and Chile. The plant is a rosette-forming perennial herb, with leafless, silky, hairy flower stems, typically growing to 45 centimetres (18 in) in height. The flower stalk is deeply furrowed, ending in an ovoid inflorescence of many small flowers each with a pointed bract. Plantago lanceolata is used in herbal teas and other herbal remedies and is also employed as a prop in various children's games. This P. lanceolata inflorescence was photographed in Kulna, Estonia.

The poplar hawkmoth (Laothoe populi) is a moth in the family Sphingidae. It is found throughout the Palearctic region and the Near East and is one of the most common members of the family in the region. The poplar hawkmoth produces one or two broods each year, the spherical, pale green eggs being laid on the underside of leaves. The larva is initially pale green with small yellow tubercles and a cream-coloured tail horn, later developing yellow diagonal stripes on its sides and growing to a length of 65 to 85 millimetres (2.6 to 3.3 in). It has a diet of tree leaves such as poplar, willow and aspen. The adult poplar hawkmoth is seen between between May and August and lives for a few weeks as an adult. During this time it does not feed, instead relying on fat built up during the larval stage. This male adult poplar hawkmoth of the subspecies L. p. populi was photographed in Cumnor Hill in Oxfordshire, England.

Arenal Volcano is a stratovolcano in north-western Costa Rica, in the province of Alajuela. It is within the Arenal Volcano National Park. The volcano is conically shaped with a height of 1,633 metres (5,358 ft) and a crater with a diameter of 140 metres (460 ft). Arenal is a young volcano, estimated to be less than 7,500 years old. The volcano was dormant for hundreds of years and exhibited two craters at its summit, with minor fumaroles activity, covered by dense vegetation. In 1968 it erupted unexpectedly, destroying the small town of Tabacón. Due to the eruption three more craters were created on the western flanks but only one of them exists today. By duration, Arenal's eruption from 1968 to 2010 is the tenth longest volcanic eruption on Earth since 1750. Since 2010, Arenal has been dormant.

The galah (Eolophus roseicapilla) is a species of bird in the cockatoo family, Cacatuidae. It is endemic to mainland Australia and is also an introduced species in Tasmania and New Zealand. The galah is adapted to a wide variety of modified and unmodified habitats and is one of Australia's most abundant and widespread bird species, being absent only from the driest areas and the far north of Cape York Peninsula. The galah is often found in flocks of 10 to 1,000 individuals, which can be mixed flocks also including the pink cockatoo, the little corella, and the sulphur-crested cockatoo. It is known to hybridize with all of these species. The galah nests in tree cavities and lays white eggs, usually two to five in a clutch. The eggs are incubated for about 25 days, and the chicks leave the nest about 49 days after hatching. Galahs in captivity have been known to live for up to 72 years. This male galah of the subspecies E. r. albiceps was photographed in the Adelaide Botanic Garden in Adelaide, South Australia.

John Cage (September 5, 1912 – August 12, 1992) was an American composer and music theorist. A pioneer of indeterminacy in music, electroacoustic music, and the non-standard use of musical instruments, Cage was one of the leading figures of the post-war avant-garde. Critics have lauded him as one of the most influential composers of the 20th century. He was also instrumental in the development of modern dance, mostly through his association with choreographer Merce Cunningham, who was also Cage's romantic partner for most of their lives. Cage's best known work is the 1952 composition 4′33″, a piece performed in the absence of deliberate sound; musicians performing the work do nothing but be present for the duration specified by the title. The content of the composition is intended to be the sounds of the environment heard by the audience during performance. This 1988 head shot of Cage is in the archives of Anefo, a Dutch photograph press agency.

Thelenota ananas, also known as pineapple sea cucumber, among other names, is a sea cucumber in the family Stichopodidae. It is found in tropical Indo-Pacific waters, on the sandy bottom of lagoons and in slabs near coral,
from the Red Sea and East Africa to Hawaii, Polynesia, the Maldives and Australia. The species is characterized by its large size – reaching up to 70 centimetres (28 inches) in length, with a mass of 3 to 6 kilograms (7 to 13 pounds) – and has pointed, star-shaped teats covering the entire body. The body is reddish-orange in color. It plays an important role in coral reef ecosystems, for example by recycling nutrients, and is often eaten as food. This T. ananas sea cucumber was photographed in the Red Sea off the coast of Egypt.

The Japanese Instrument of Surrender is a written agreement that was signed on the deck of the battleship Missouri in Tokyo Bay on 2 September 1945. It formalized the surrender of Japan and marked the end of hostilities in World War II. The agreement was signed on behalf of Emperor Hirohito by Japanese foreign minister Mamoru Shigemitsu, and on behalf of the Japanese armed forces by General Yoshijirō Umezu, Chief of the Army General Staff. It was then signed by representatives from the Allied nations: the United States, China, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, Australia, Canada, France, the Netherlands, and New Zealand. This image shows the Allied copy of the Japanese Instrument of Surrender, which is now housed in the United States National Archives Building in Washington, D.C.

Castle Square is a historic square in Warsaw, Poland, that serves as the gateway to Warsaw's Old Town. The square features the Royal Castle and Sigismund's Column, and is surrounded by historic townhouses. It forms the starting point of the Royal Route. The Old Town, including Castle Square, suffered extensive damage during World War II and was reconstructed in the postwar period. In 1980, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) inscribed the Historic Centre of Warsaw on the list of World Heritage Sites as an example of the near-total reconstruction of a historic town centre. This photograph shows an elevated view of Castle Square in 2024, as seen from the tower of St. Anne's Church, facing roughly northwards. Sigismund's Column can be seen in the foreground on the left, and the Royal Castle is the building on the right of the image. A part of the facade and roof of St. John's Archcathedral is visible in the background.

Sparassis crispa is a species of fungus in the family Sparassidaceae. It is sometimes called cauliflower fungus. It is common in Great Britain and temperate Europe (but not in the boreal zone), from July to November. Sparassis crispa grows in an entangled globe that is up to 10 inches (24 centimetres) in diameter, with larger specimens weighing up to 14 kilograms (30 lb) or more. It is considered a good edible fungus when young and fresh, but is difficult to clean before use. This S. crispa was photographed in Joure, Netherlands. The picture was focus-stacked from 20 separate images.

Images of the Mandelbrot set exhibit an infinitely complicated boundary that reveals progressively ever-finer recursive detail at increasing magnifications; mathematically, the boundary of the Mandelbrot set is a fractal curve. The Mandelbrot set is well-known outside mathematics and is commonly cited as an example of mathematical beauty.

The American avocet (Recurvirostra americana) is a large wader in the avocet and stilt family, Recurvirostridae, found in North America. It spends much of its time foraging in shallow water or on mud flats, often sweeping its bill from side to side in water as it seeks crustacean and insect prey. The bird is around 40–51 cm (16–20 in) in length and has a bill which is black, pointed, and curved slightly upwards towards the tip. Its breeding habitat consists of marshes, beaches, prairie ponds, and shallow lakes in the Midwestern United States and southern Canada. This American avocet was photographed in Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge East Pond, New York City, United States.

"I Have a Dream" is a public speech that was delivered by the American civil rights movement activist and Baptist minister Martin Luther King Jr. during the March on Washington on August 28, 1963. In the speech, which was delivered to more than 250,000 civil rights supporters from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., King called for civil and economic rights and an end to legalized racism in the United States. He noted the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863, which declared millions of slaves free, but said that "one hundred years later, the Negro still is not free". The speech is regarded as one of the most famous moments of the civil rights movement and among the most iconic speeches in American history. This photograph, from the collection of the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historical Park, shows King shortly after concluding his speech, waving to the crowd assembled around the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool. The Washington Monument is visible in the background.

Pardachirus marmoratus is a species of flatfish in the true sole family Soleidae, native to the western Indian Ocean from the Red Sea to Sri Lanka and along the east coast of Africa to Durban. It is found in shallow, coastal waters where the seabed consists of sand or mud, often near coral reefs, and feeds mainly on benthic invertebrates. The body is highly compressed, convex on the eyed side and flat on the blind side. Its colour is frequently whitish, pale brown to pale grey with a scattering of irregular dark brown ring shape markings and many dark brown spots on the head, body, and fins. Pardachirus marmoratus's colour provides camouflage when it rests on sandy or pebbled seafloors. This camouflaged P. marmoratus individual was photographed in the Indian Ocean near Zanzibar.

Willistead Manor is a historic house located in the former town of Walkerville, Ontario, now part of Windsor. Designed by Albert Kahn for Edward Chandler Walker and built between 1904 and 1906, the manor was ceded to the community in 1921, a few years after Walker's death. Having served as Walkerville's town hall, the Art Gallery of Windsor, and a branch of the Windsor Public Library, it is currently used as a banquet hall. The manor is designed in the Tudor Revival style, and the grounds also include a coach house and a gate house of similar design. This photograph shows the front facade of Willistead Manor in 2025.

The date palm (Phoenix dactylifera) is a species of flowering plant in the palm family, Arecaceae, cultivated for its edible sweet fruit known as dates. The species is widely cultivated across North Africa, the Middle East, the Horn of Africa, Australia, South Asia, and the desert regions of southern California in the United States. Phoenix dactylifera is the type species of the genus Phoenix, which contains 12 to 19 species of wild date palms. This focus-stacked photograph shows two mazafati dates grown in Iran, one whole and one halved with its seed removed.

The Apollo Lunar Module was the lunar lander that was flown between lunar orbit and the Moon's surface during the American Apollo program. Ten Lunar Modules were launched into space between 1968 and 1972. It was the first crewed spacecraft to operate exclusively in space, and remains the only crewed vehicle to land anywhere beyond Earth. Incapable of flight through Earth's atmosphere, the two-stage spacecraft was ferried to lunar orbit attached to the Apollo command and service module, about twice its mass. Its crew of two flew the Lunar Module from lunar orbit to the Moon's surface. During takeoff, the spent descent stage was used as a launch pad for the ascent stage which then flew back to the command module, after which it was also discarded. This photograph, taken by Neil Armstrong during the Apollo 11 mission in 1969, shows Buzz Aldrin removing equipment from the Lunar Module Eagle on the surface of the Moon at Tranquility Base.
