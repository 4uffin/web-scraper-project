WHAT I DO
I do image restoration, taking an old image with flaws that make it unusable, and carefully fixing it back into a useful image. For example:
BEFORE
AFTER
It requires careful work and attention to detail, and a willingness to spend a few hours removing individual dust spots with the healing brush, because you care about helping to share knowledge, and this is the best way to provide illustrations of that. My 744 restorations currently make up about 8.8% of all featured pictures on English Wikipedia, and you'd be surprised at just how much code I put in to keeping that as up to date as possible.
Fun fact, by the way: See those empty borders on images? They are the absolute worst, because the slightest discolouration will be incredibly visible. On some images, I've spent three times the effort on the bits no-one pays attention to... unless you don't spend that effort.
I've been working on a series of articles on how I research and restore images for the Wikipedia Signpost. You can read the first here.

These are not featured pictures yet. But should be. They are either currently being voted on or will be soon. Hopefully.
Things either currently nominated, about to be nominated, or awaiting renomination[edit]
May also include things about to be nominated, but only when there's a problem at WP:FPC (or they're only nearly done, but will be done in a day or two. This is wildly optimistic in most cases, and you should really not pay attention to anything I say about scheduling.)

Featured Sounds[edit]
(List not complete by any means - I have 40% of all FSes, so I need to copy over a lot more =) )
1898 – Fantasie
Gabriel Fauré's Fantasie (1898), performed circa 1976 by Alex Murray (flute) and Martha Goldstein (piano).
1906 – Frog Legs Rag
Frog Legs Rag, a classic ragtime piece by James Scott. Performed on a synthesized piano by Wikipedian Adam Cuerden in 2010 with technical assistance from Jujutacular.
1914 – Duo for violin and cello
Zoltán Kodály's Duo for violin and cello, Op. 7, performed by the U.S. Army Strings.
1917 – Études-Tableaux, Op. 39, No. 5
Sergei Rachmaninoff wrote two sets of Études-Tableaux in 1911 (Op. 33) and 1917 (Op. 39); this recording is one of the pieces in the second, Opus 39 set. Conceived as "picture pieces", meant to evoke a visual scene, Rachmaninoff nonetheless declined to identify which scene he had in mind for most of the pieces, saying, "I don't believe in the artist that discloses too much of his images. Let [the listener] paint for themselves what it most suggests."
Performed by Karine Gilanyan for Musopen.
