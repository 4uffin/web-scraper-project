Samoan LGBTQ rights activist and lawyer (1963–2025)
Ymania BrownBorn(1963-09-11)11 September 1963Died15 September 2025(2025-09-15) (aged 62)Berlin, GermanyKnown forLGBTQ rights advocacy
Lealaitagomoa Toalepaialii Tuisina Ymania Brown-Gabriel (11 September 1963 – 15 September 2025), better known as Ymania Brown, was a Samoan LGBTQ rights activist and lawyer.
Brown served as co–Secretary General of ILGA World from 2019 to 2024, as co-President of Interpride, and as Executive Director of Transgender Europe from 2024 until her death.
Background[edit]
Brown was born on 11 September 1963[1][2][3] and grew up in Samoa.[4] She began identifying as a girl at age three, which her mother was supportive of, but her father was resistant to.[5] Her mother left the family when she was nine, in response to domestic violence exacerbated by her father's alcoholism.[4] She helped raise her younger sibling after her mother left.[4] One of her father's cousins moved in with the family, and he sexually abused Brown for multiple years. She left Samoa to join her mother and stepfather in New Zealand.[4]
Brown later moved to Australia, but struggled to find jobs due to discrimination based on her gender identity.[4] She became homeless, and worked as a sex worker in Sydney.[4] She was able to save enough money to have gender-affirming surgery in 1989.[4]
After her surgery, Brown moved to Europe and worked as a model.[4] A few years later, she returned to New Zealand to attend college.[4] She held a master's degree in law.[6] In the late 1990s she returned to Sydney, where she found a corporate job for a software company through one of her university lecturers.[4] First working in human resources and later becoming in-house legal counsel, Brown continued to work in a corporate setting in Sydney for the next twenty years.[7] She chose to become a full-time activist during the COVID-19 pandemic.[8]
Activism[edit]
Brown served as Executive Director of TGEU[9] (from July 2024 until her death), as co-secretary general of ILGA World (from March 2019 until November 2024),[7] and as Co-President of Interpride.[4][10][11] She also worked as technical director of the Samoa Fa'afafine Association (from at least June 2013)[12] and with Sydney World Pride through Equality Australia.[7][4]
In 2014 Brown acted as the co-chair of ILGA Oceania.[4] She later became co-chair of the Global Interfaith Network for People of All Sexes, Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Expression (GINSSOGIE) and the International Trans Fund.[4] She also served on advisory boards for Astraea and WorldPride (Copenhagen 2021).[13]
Brown was involved with campaigns to have the Samoan government recognise adoption by LGBT individuals and to repeal laws that criminalised "impersonation of a woman".[4][10] Her advocacy primarily focused more on financial equality than marriage equality.[14] She also encouraged Australia to focus on LGBT rights as part of their foreign policy.[15]
She served as a matai across four districts in Samoa.[13]
Personal life and death[edit]
Brown identified as both a trans woman and as faʻafafine.[4] She had two sons, whom she adopted from the sister of a previous partner living in Samoa.[5][4] She was Catholic.[16]
Brown died on 15 September 2025, aged 62, at the Charité's German Heart Center in Berlin, Germany, from medical complications following a planned heart surgery.[7][3]
Recognition and awards[edit]
Shivananda Khan Award for Extraordinary Achievement, 2020 Asia Pacific HERO Awards, APCOM Foundation[6]
