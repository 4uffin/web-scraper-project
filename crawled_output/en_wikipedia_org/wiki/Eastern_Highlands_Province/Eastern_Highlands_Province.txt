Demography[edit]
Eastern Highland Province had a population of 432,972 (PNG citizens) and 1,173 (non-citizens) in the 2000 Census. This is an increase of 31% since the 1990 Census figure.[4]
Provincial leaders[edit]
The province was governed by a decentralised provincial administration, headed by a Regional Member, from 1977 to 1995. Following reforms taking effect that year, the national government reassumed some powers, and the role of Regional Member was replaced by a position of Governor, to be held by the winner of the province-wide seat in the National Parliament of Papua New Guinea.[5][6]
