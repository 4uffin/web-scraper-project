The 2024 MTV Video Music Awards were held at the UBS Arena in Elmont, New York, on September 11, 2024. The ceremony was originally scheduled to take place on September 10, 2024, but was rescheduled to a day later to avoid conflicts with the presidential debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. The show was hosted by rapper, Megan Thee Stallion, marking her hosting debut.
It honored the best music videos and songs released between June 22, 2023, and June 20, 2024.[4][5] Two new award categories, VMAs Most Iconic Performance and Best Trending Video, were awarded through the fan votes.[6] Taylor Swift was the most nominated and awarded artist, winning seven trophies out of twelve nominations, including five wins out of nine nominations for her collaboration with Post Malone on the single "Fortnight".[7][8][9] Katy Perry was honored with the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award presented by her fiancé Orlando Bloom.[10] This was the first VMA ceremony to be available on subscription streaming through Vix.
