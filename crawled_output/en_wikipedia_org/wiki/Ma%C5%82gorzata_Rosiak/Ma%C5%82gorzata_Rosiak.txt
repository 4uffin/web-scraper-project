I convinced my dad to buy me a snowboard."[7] Coached by her father, she was a member of the club Beskidzkiego Stow.

Rosiak won three national championships in 1996 (giant slalom, halfpipe, combined) and a medal at the Junior World Championships.[3][17] In 1997, she won a bronze medal at the World Championships in combined and won a silver at the European Championships in the same event.[3][10] With medals at the Junior World Championships, World Championships, European Championships and the World Cup, she became the most decorated Polish snowboarder at the time.[17] She also placed eighth in the parallel slalom and 32nd in the giant slalom at the 1997 World Championships.[3] Additionally, she won the halfpipe championship and finished as runner-up in the giant slalom and parallel slalom at the 1997 Polish championships.[3][18] Rosiak participated at the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, finishing 19th in the women's giant slalom event.[1] She won the Polish halfpipe and combined championships that year,[3] and won two bronze medals at the 1999 Polish championships.[19][20] She also participated at the 1999 World Championships, with a best placement of 16th in the snowboardcross, and at the 2000 European Cup, finishing 15th.[21][22] In her career, she won 14 gold and four silver medals at the Polish championships.[3]
