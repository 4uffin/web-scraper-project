Dev Mode is included in the Full and Dev seats on all paid plans.Get startedContact salesTrusted by teams atUnlock design-informed code generation through MCPThe Dev Mode MCP server brings Figma design context directly into your agentic coding tools, like VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf, and Claude, for a more efficient and accurate design-to-code workflow.Read this guide to the Dev Mode MCP ServerFind the information you need to start building, fastWith features designed to simplify code inspection and highlight what’s ready for development, your workflow will be smoother than ever.Compare design changesSee when a frame or component was last edited, or open version history to compare design changes side-by-side.Learn moreDive into design specificationsInspect component properties like color codes and token values, check spacing, and copy and paste code to speed up your development process.Learn moreChange the view for more clarityClick into the Ready for dev view to see designs that are marked as ready for development. You can also click on specific components to isolate them in Focus view.Learn moreBuild with VS Code extensionWork in an environment you already know and love with the VS Code extension—less screen switching and more coding.Learn moreFigma’s Dev Mode facilitates a streamlined collaboration between developers and designers, reducing the friction between the two — and we love it.Sandra Schaus Lead UX Expert, Business Development Services, Volkswagen Group ServicesConnect your design system and code base for consistent buildsDev Mode gives you the power to build consistent, reusable designs and seamlessly link them to your codebase using Code Connect.Link your codebase with Code ConnectCode Connect lets you instantly generate ready-to-use snippets by linking your codebase with your existing design system in Figma.Learn moreSee all component optionsThe Component playground lets you view all possible component variations, see how they behave, and even gives you the code to implement. All you have to do is choose the best option.Learn moreAccess system-wide design variablesStay on-brand and save time by using existing variables—or token values—with corresponding code syntaxes in Figma. This makes it easy to keep things consistent across your applications.Learn moreWhat we love about Code Connect is that it reduces so much of the context switching that developers had to do before.Gilson Hoffmeister Design Systems Strategist, HPStreamline the back and forth with design partnersFeatures like status updates, comments, and annotations keep you on the same page with designers throughout your build.Cut down on repeat work with better communicationGet notified of design changes in real-time so you’re never building based on outdated information. The Ready for dev view provides a clear summary of what’s ready to build, what’s changed, and what’s done.Learn moreCode with contextScan through annotations and comments from designers to get a clear understanding of what you need to build.Learn moreCheck your measurementsDesigners can add measurements to help you quickly visualize spacing and sizing, so nothing gets lost in translation as you go from design to code.Learn moreDig into more design and development resourcesEverything You Need to Know About Dev ModeWe built Dev Mode to make product development more efficient, from idea to code.
