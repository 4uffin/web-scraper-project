$28 | Releases October 28

Arrival was one of the best movies of 2016, earning “Universal Acclaim” on Metacritic and landing Academy Awards nominations for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Cinematography, among many others. The screenwriter for Arrival, Eric Heisserer, is now set to release his debut novel--Simultaneous: A Novel--on October 28.

Preorders are now open at Amazon, so give it a look if you want a mind-bending thriller to help ease you into these chilly fall nights.
Simultaneous: A Novel (Hardcover)
$28 | Releases October 28
Simultaneous follows Grant Lukather, a federal agent working in the Predictive Analytics department of Homeland Security. He’s tasked with listening to potential terrorists’ conversations and preempting any attacks. And when he learns of a potential explosion in New Mexico, he’ll set out on a mission with unexpectedly high stakes.Along the way, he’ll meet up with Sarah Newcomb--a therapist who has recently discovered a strange phenomenon while practicing hypnosis. The two, along with help from one of Newcomb’s patients, will set out on a thrilling quest that takes place across not just multiple locations, but multiple timelines and consciousnesses. The novel is earning plenty of praise from big names like Josh Malerman, the author of Bird Box, who said “Heisserer has outdone himself.” Leigh Bardugo, the author behind the Shadow and Bone trilogy, called it, “A twisty, mind-bending thriller that will keep you guessing until the final gut punch.”
