A few of the best GameCube-inspired controllers for Nintendo Switch, Switch 2, and PC are on sale for their best prices of the year at Amazon. NYXI's Warrior and Wizard wireless controllers combine the GameCube form factor with modern features like Hall Effect sticks, remappable back buttons, microswitch triggers, and other customization options. The Warrior Lite Bluetooth Controller released earlier this year with the GameCube's iconic purple color scheme. Normally $50, you can grab this versatile gamepad for $40, which is the best price yet.If you also want 2.4GHz Wireless support for original GameCube and Wii hardware--and PC with the included adapter--you can step up to the Warrior for $55 (was $69).NYXI Warrior Lite Bluetooth Controller for Switch 2, Switch, PC NYXI Warrior Lite Wireless Controller (Purple) -- $40 ($50)NYXI Warrior Wireless Controller -- $55 ($69)

PurpleOrangeBlackSilverAnd after being sold out for most of the year, the NYXI Wizard is back in stock and discounted to $56 (was $70). On the original Switch and Switch OLED, the Wizard can replace your left and right Joy-Con in handheld mode. It's also a traditional wireless controller for Switch and Switch 2 when both sides are connected to the included bridge. It does not work in handheld mode on Switch 2.We've tested the Warrior Lite, Warrior, and Wizard on Nintendo Switch 2, Switch, and PC. Take an in-depth look at each model below.

Key FeaturesBluetooth Wireless: Switch 2, Switch, PC, MobileHall Effect sticks and triggersModern trigger and bumper designAdjustable trigger locksTwo remappable back buttonsSwappable back button moduleSwappable sticks and gatesMicroswitch face buttons8-way microswitch D-pad6-axis gyroscope for motion controlsAdjustable dual-rumble motorsTurbo functionUp to 5 hours of battery lifeThe Warrior Lite replicates the general shape, layout, and color scheme of the original GameCube controller. It's a bit chunkier and wider than the real thing, so it doesn't have the same exact form factor, but it adds several compelling features that make it a versatile option for GameCube games on Switch Online as well as modern Nintendo games.Beyond offering conventional bumpers and triggers, the Warrior Lite has two remappable back buttons. The right and left back buttons have a one-piece panel design that can be removed and switched with an alternate panel inside the box. The main difference between the two styles of back buttons is that one of them is textured and slightly raised for increased tactile feedback.The Warrior Lite is equipped with anti-drift Hall Effect sticks. The right stick mimics the GameCube's yellow C-stick, but you can swap it out for a yellow stick with a more conventional, larger grip. Similarly, you can switch between octagonal stick gates inspired by the GameCube controller and regular stick gates with a circular range of motion.Face buttons, the 8-way D-pad, and shoulder bumpers are actuated by microswitches, giving them a mouse-click feel. Like the sticks, the triggers are activated with Hall Effect sensors, and can be set at two different stopping points with the locking switches on the back. Other core features include built-in, adjustable rumble and 6-axis motion controls.The main downside here is battery life, as the Lite version has a smaller battery that only runs for up to five hours on a full charge. Like many Bluetooth controllers for Switch 2 and Switch, you can use the Warrior Lite on PC, mobile, Steam Deck, and other devices.

The Warrior has the added benefit of working as a wireless controller on actual GameCube and Wii hardware. The included 2.4GHz receiver plugs into the GameCube's controller port and can also be used on PC with the included USB adapter. The Warrior also has a larger battery that can run for up to 10 hours between charges, which is a nice perk.While the Warrior Lite is only available in purple, the original Warrior has purple, black, and orange color options. All three are eligible for Amazon's discount.

NYXI Wizard Nintendo Switch 1/2 Wireless Controller
$56 (was $70) | Switch 2 - Docked Only / Switch - Handheld & Docked
Key FeaturesReplaces Joy-Cons in handheld mode on Switch & Switch OLEDBluetooth Wireless: Switch 2, Switch, PC, MobileAvailable in Purple, Black, Silver, OrangeHall Effect sticksMechanical triggers and bumpersTwo remappable back buttonsOctagonal and round stick gatesIlluminated ABXY buttons4-way D-pad6-axis gyroscope for motion controlsAdjustable dual-rumble motorsTurbo function6-8 hours of battery life The NYXI Wizard works on Nintendo Switch 2, but you can only use it for docked or tabletop modes. On the original Switch and Switch OLED, the Wizard can replace your Joy-Con in handheld mode. The left and right sides detach from the center bridge and connect to the console via sliding mechanisms. The Switch 2 uses a magnetic connection method for the updated Joy-Con 2 controllers, which makes the Wizard incompatible with Nintendo's new console for portable play.If you're picking up one of NYXI's GameCube-style controllers specifically for Nintendo Switch 2, most players should opt for the Warrior or Warrior Lite. But if you still use both consoles, the Wizard is potentially the more intriguing option. There are a few differences between the Warrior and Wizard controllers, though.The Wizard has slimmer, mechanical triggers and bumpers. Unlike the Warrior, it doesn't have dual trigger modes; all four shoulder buttons are activated via microswitches. These feel great, but you can't switch to the traditional trigger pull action like you can on the Warrior. The two built-in, textured back buttons are located in natural spots and feel great.The ABXY face button labels have customizable lighting effects, which is a cool addition, though the buttons and the 4-way D-pad ditch the microswitches for traditional membranes.Regardless of which base color you choose, the Wizard comes with one gray and one yellow Hall Effect stick. Round and Octagonal stick gates are included inside the box, but if you want the smaller C-sticks, you'll need to buy a thumbstick kit from NYXI for $10--unless you have one of the Warrior controllers, as they use the same sticks and gates.Other features include 6-axis motion controls, adjustable rumble, and turbo buttons on each side. Battery life falls between the Warrior and Warrior Lite.

It's worth noting that NYXI recently launched the Wizard 2. Just like the Wizard, the second-gen model works in handheld mode on Switch and Switch OLED. If you buy it for Switch 2, it will only work in TV mode. The Wizard 2 has upgraded TMR joysticks, dual trigger modes, and microswitch face buttons. Essentially, NYXI implemented some of the features found in its Warrior controllers, which are newer than the original Wizard. The Wizard 2 retails for $90 and hasn't received any discounts yet.NYXI Wizard in handheld mode on original Switch.

As mentioned, Nintendo's wireless GameCube controller for Switch 2 is as close to the original as you'll find. It feels almost exactly like the original, just without the cable and with a few extra small buttons on the top: C button for GameChat, home/menu buttons, and a small ZL button to make up for the fact the GameCube controller only had one shoulder button. But while this is best option for GameCube games on Switch Online, the aforementioned tiny ZL button makes it less than ideal for modern games.Unfortunately, the price of the official Nintendo Switch Online GameCube controller recently increased to $70.Officially licensed GameCube-style controllers from PowerA and Hori add Nintendo-inspired designs and have modernized shoulder and trigger layouts. The form factor of these controllers is closer to the original GameCube controller, as they have slimmer profiles compared to the NYXI Warrior. PowerA also recently raised the price of its GameCube-style controller to $70.Looking for a conventional Switch 2 or PC controller? Check out the 8BitDo Ultimate 2 and brand-new 8BitDo Pro 3 Wireless Controllers, both of which are discounted at Amazon this weekend.
