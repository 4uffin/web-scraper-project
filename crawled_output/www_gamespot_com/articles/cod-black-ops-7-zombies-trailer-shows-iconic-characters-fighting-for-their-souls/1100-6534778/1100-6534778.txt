Now Playing: Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 - Ashes of the Damned Zombies Cinematic Trailer
There is still plenty of uncertainty on how the original cast ended up in Janus Towers with Weaver's team, but the trailer shows the two separate casts fighting together as they face the undead and some mysterious new villain. This new threat is a man with a southern drawl and a cowboy hat, who lugs around caged-up zombie heads.The man uses his zombie heads to seemingly use magic to pull the life force from both teams, leaving all the characters looking purple-eyed and partially zombified. So, it seems the Black Ops 7 storyline will be based around fighting this new enemy, gaining back their souls, and escaping the Dark Aether.Black Ops 7 brings the new and old crews together for an epic fight.Gallery
Black Ops 7 launches with the largest round-based map the mode has ever seen, and as can be expected from the trailer, the map takes place inside the Dark Aether. The map is inspired by Black Ops 2's Tranzit map, and a new Wonder Vehicle will be used to traverse the dangerous roads that connect different areas of the map. Activision also appears to be creating a real-life version of this new Zombies vehicle, as spotted during an online stream.It's also worth noting that Treyarch has confirmed the iconic characters in Black Ops 7 are not the same variants of the cast we've seen in previous years. Instead of the Ultimis or Primis versions of the characters, they are "never-before-seen incarnations" of the original Zombies crew.The developer said more Zombies information would be revealed next week. Additional Black Ops 7 details and live gameplay will arrive during the Call of Duty: Next event on September 30. The Black Ops 7 multiplayer beta early access begins on October 2 for Xbox, PlayStation, and PC platforms.Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 launches on November 14 for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC. You can find highlights of all major Black Ops 7 announcements here, which includes details on the campaign, a massive round-based Zombies map, and a futuristic multiplayer.Black Ops 7 -- Here Are 8 New Things We Learned About The MultiplayerSee More
