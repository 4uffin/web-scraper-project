This past weekend saw the launch of Fortnite's new battle royale mode, Delulu. A take on Fortnite's familiar formula, the catch here is that you can talk to anyone--whether squaded up or not--thanks to the new proximity chat. While this adds a nice layer of sociality to the game, it's also resulted in an increase in discrimination and harassment, which led to developer Epic Games banning "thousands" of accounts before the weekend closed out.Delulu is exactly what you think it would be if you're familiar with both Fortnite and internet slang. Cutesy shorthand for "delusional," this new mode sees you potentially team up with--and likely betray, as there can only be one winner--anyone you see thanks to proximity chat. As you near another player, you can form a sort of temporary group chat to strategize as you play. This seems like it could be a fabulous idea, particularly for players who tend to play solo but still want to coordinate.

According to an IGN report, players on the game's subreddit have shared mixed experiences, with many discussing the bigotry they faced because of "their accent, their age or because they're a woman."Developer Epic Games took to X on September 21 to remind players to report chat that violates community rules, stating that "thousands" have been banned.Remember to report voice chat behavior in-game that violates our community rules.
