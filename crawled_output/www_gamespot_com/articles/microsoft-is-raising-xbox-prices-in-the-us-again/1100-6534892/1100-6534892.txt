If you were planning on getting an Xbox console for the holidays, you might want to act sooner rather than later, because Microsoft has just announced that it's once again raising the price of its consoles starting October 3.Beginning October 3, the most affordable Xbox on the market, the 512GB Xbox Series S, will cost $400 in the US. The most expensive Xbox Series X model, which comes with a disc drive and two terabytes of storage, will run folks $800. Here are the rest of the price changes to the Xbox lineup:Xbox Series S 512GB -- $400 (was $380)Xbox Series S 1TB -- $450 (was $430)Xbox Series X Digital -- $600 (was $550)Xbox Series X -- $650 (was $500)Xbox Series X 2TB Galaxy Black Special Edition - $800 (was $730)This is the second price increase that Microsoft has issued this year alone after it raised prices on the consoles earlier this May. In its announcement, Microsoft suggests that these price hikes are "due to changes in the macroeconomic environment." Prices outside of the US will remain as they are.The increase in prices for consoles, as well as their games and accessories, has been an alarming trend over the last year and is believed to be connected to tariffs being imposed by the current US administration, though few of these companies have outright come forward and said as much.Nevertheless, PlayStation similarly raised its prices earlier this year, and the Switch 2 pre-orders were even briefly delayed in the US while Nintendo weighed its options. When the console did finally become available, many of the prices for games and accessories were higher than audiences expected, and just last month, Nintendo even raised the price of the original Switch.More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals & Preorders
