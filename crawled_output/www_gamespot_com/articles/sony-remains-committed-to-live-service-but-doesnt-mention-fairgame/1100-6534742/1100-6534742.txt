Now Playing: Fairgame$ - CGI Reveal Trailer | PS5 & PC Games
Sony also called out one title that will be important to the company's live-service business going forward: Bungie's Marathon. The game was recently delayed indefinitely and has been caught up in stolen art claims. The document does not mention any other upcoming live-service games, however, including the reportedly troubled Fairgame$.That game is in development at Sony's Haven Studios, whose top boss, Jade Raymond, left the studio following apparent concerns about Fairgame$. The game was reportedly delayed and is now said to be coming in Spring 2026, putting it in the vicinity of GTA 6 in May 2026.The director of Fairgame$, Daniel Drapeau, left the company earlier this year. These changes, and the lack of mention in Sony's corporate report, do not necessarily mean Fairgame$ is in trouble.At one point in time, Sony wanted to release 12 live-service games over the coming years (alongside its commitment to single-player games). However, in May 2023, Sony announced that it was halving its planned live-service game output, with management stressing it wanted to focus on quality over quantity. After this announcement, Naughty Dog's The Last of Us multiplayer game was canceled in December 2023.At the beginning of 2024, though, Sony found its biggest success to date in the live-service market with Helldivers 2--the game went on to smash sales records and become the No. 3 overall best-selling game of 2024 in the US. It recently came to Xbox, and, along with a new update, has seen a huge surge in popularity.Sony's biggest failure in the live-service market was Concord, which launched in August 2024 and had such a dismal performance out of the gate that Sony quickly took the game offline and refunded all players. Its developer, Firewalk, was later closed. At the end of 2024, Sony confirmed that it canceled multiple projects, including a live-service God of War and another live-service title from Bend.Following the failure of Concord, top boss Hermen Hulst said Sony put new structures in place to help ensure its live-service games come to market in better shape.The Best PS5 Games In 2025See More
