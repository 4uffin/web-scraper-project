Silent Hill f Day One Edition (Amazon Exclusive)
$70 | Releases September 25
Preorder at Amazon
The first brand-new Silent Hill game in more than a decade releases this Thursday, September 25. Fresh off its sublime Silent Hill 2 remake, Konami has delivered another memorable survival horror game with Silent Hill f. The standalone spin-off earned a 9/10 in our review and currently holds an 86 critic average on Metacritic (a GameSpot sister site). If you haven't preordered the physical edition for PS5 or Xbox Series X yet, check out the Amazon-exclusive edition of Silent Hill f while it's still in stock. As of September 23, Amazon is still offering release-day delivery, too. The Amazon-exclusive version comes with a double-sided poster and retails for the same $70 price as the standard edition at other retailers. It's actually one of several soon-to-be-released games with Amazon-exclusive double-sided posters in the box. Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles and Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds also come with exclusive posters at Amazon. If you're unsure if you want to play on console or PC, the preorder deal at GameSpot sister site Fanatical may make that decision a bit easier. Fanatical is offering a 25% discount on Steam keys for the standard and Digital Deluxe Editions. With the preorder deal, you'll only pay $52.49 for the standard edition and $60 (was $80) for the Deluxe.
