Keep in mind that, depending on your location, the games may not arrive exactly on their release date. The versions with early access remain the best way to get your hands on Code Vein II as soon as possible--but be sure to check your location's specific shipping details for more info on when it'll arrive.Code Vein II sees you playing as a Revenant Hunter accompanied by Lou--a strange character that can manipulate time. The duo will travel between two timelines, manipulating the present by interacting with Revenants in the past. Along the way, they’ll unravel a mystery regarding the true reason the world collapsed, all while engaging in tense, Souls-like combat.Our Code Vein review gave the original title a 6/10, saying that while it leans a bit too much on the Souls-like formula, it nonetheless offers its own take on the style thanks to its worldbuilding and anime-inspired art style. “Code Vein establishes its own identity from the outset,” wrote critic Richard Wakeling. “It may latch onto a Dark Souls formula that has come to define a generation of action-RPGs, but Bandai Namco's latest manages to set itself apart from the rest by presenting a post-apocalyptic world filled with what are essentially anime vampires. Interesting concepts and mechanics filter out from this central blood-soaked idea, resulting in a game that feels familiar yet wildly different from its inspiration.” Sign up for GameSpot's Weekly Deals Newsletter: More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals & Preorders
