The first new Skate game in 15 years is out now in early access. It's off to a hot start on Steam, though there are also some issues impacting the experience as it relates to server stability and more. EA and developer Full Circle are addressing those issues now, and updates and improvements will continue, with the game planned to stay in early access for a year. Skate is a free-to-play game available in early access, meaning the experience is not up to 1.0 as of yet. Every early-access game is different, so here are some key things to know about Skate.

Now Playing: skate. | Early Access Release Date Reveal Trailer
Why early access?Posting on Steam, developer Full Circle said early access was the right call for Skate because the studio wanted to make the game "in partnership" with players. "Our early access launch will be a starting point from which new features, improvements, live events, and seasonal content will be added over time," the developer said.When is 1.0?Full Circle wasn't ready to commit to exactly how long Skate will remain in early access. However, the team said it expects Skate to reach a "full" release in about one year, meaning September 2026. That being said, Full Circle said "we don't know for certain at this time" if that will be the case.The FAQ also states that the Skate early access launch includes the "essentials" of what's going to be in the "full" release. Whenever that comes, players can expect more challenges, features, live events, and gameplay improvements.Will it get more expensive?Skate is a free-to-play that makes money from microtransactions and the sale of the Founder's Pack ($25) and the Founder's Pack Deluxe ($50). Some games change price after leaving early access, but that doesn't sound like it'll be the case for Skate. Full Circle said Skate will be free in early access "and beyond."The new Skate is the first entry in the series since 2010's Skate 3, so fans have been waiting a long time. The game is available now on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S. There is no word on if it's going to come to Switch 2, but an iOS and Android version is coming at a later date.If you're just getting started with Skate, you can check out some of GameSpot's guides below.How To Make Money In Skate And Get Free RewardsIf You're Playing Skate, Change These Settings ASAPHow To Add Friends In Skate - Crossplay And Cross-Saves ExplainedSkate Season 1 Start And End Dates, What You Can Expect25 Best Free Games To Play In 2025See More
