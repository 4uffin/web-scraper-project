2026 looks to be a very exciting year for video games. In addition to being the first full year for the Switch 2--we'll surely hear about even more games for the system as we move further into the year--2026 will also see the release of Grand Theft Auto 6, which is widely anticipated as one of the biggest entertainment launches of all time. We'll see plenty of other sequels to popular franchises, as well as a number of brand-new games across everything from console to mobile.In order for you to keep track of everything coming in 2026, GameSpot has broken down the entire year by month, showing games with final release dates as well as games given a nebulous "2026" window. As more games are announced, they'll be added to this list, and those given final dates will be shifted into the relevant sections.
