A few weeks back we covered a deal on the standard edition of God of War: 20th Anniversary Retrospective, but now it's the Deluxe Edition's turn. Normally $200, the beautiful Deluxe Edition box set is discounted to $115.41 at Amazon. This is a limited-time deal, and over 40% of copies have been claimed already. It probably goes without saying, but the $85 price cut is the best deal yet on the two-book hardcover box set. The 20th Anniversary Retrospective was published by Dark Horse in July. The standard edition box set is up for grabs for $80.79 (was $100), but it's worth noting the recent (expired) deal dropped the price to $66.33. It's also available as a Kindle ebook for $35. Check out both editions as well as deals on other God of War books below, including The Art of God of War Ragnarok Deluxe Edition for over 50% off.God of War: 20th Anniversary Retrospective: Standard Edition$80.79 ($100)God of War: 20th Anniversary RetrospectiveThe God of War: 20th Anniversary Retrospective Set is a two-volume hardcover book collection featuring 320 pages of artwork, behind-the-scenes materials, and exclusive interviews with key members of each game's development team.
