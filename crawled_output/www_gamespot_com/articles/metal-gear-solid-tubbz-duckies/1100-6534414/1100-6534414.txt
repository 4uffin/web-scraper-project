Between Funko Pops, Labubu, and Nendoroid, the in thing with toy manufacturers seems to be pocket-sized collectibles that put a distinct spin on fan-favorite movies and video games. Tubbz is one such company that does just that, but arguably, its "rubber duckie" versions of popular IP is one of the most distinctive right now. They're a combination of cute but goofy designs that retain the core appeal of their source material--including a line based on Konami's acclaimed stealth espionage action series, Metal Gear Solid.

Technically, these are cosplaying duckies. Some of them are packaged inside a general window box, others come in replica bathtubs, and there are even mini-duckies in case you'd like to carry one around with you. So far, the Metal Gear Solid line has covered a fair number of characters, including Solid Snake himself, Genome soldiers, and the Cyborg Ninja AKA Grey Fox. Amazon even has an exclusive Stealth Camouflage version of Solid Snake, but that box looks empty to us.If you'd like to grab some of these collectibles, we've listed all of the Metal Gear Solid duckies currently available for purchase.
Solid Snake
$14.27 (was $20.61)
Solid Snake comes equipped with everything you'd expect from a rubber duckie version of the character: a SOCOM pistol, sneaking suit, and a scowl that can pierce through the fabric of his bandana. This duckie also comes packaged inside of a sneaky bathtub, and f you'd like a reallysneaky Solid Snake, there's also a mini version of the hero.

Solid Snake (Mini)
Stealth Camouflage Solid Snake
$30
Available exclusively through Amazon, Solid Snake is virtually invisible thanks to the translucent green material used to create this collectible. It accurately mimics the stealth camouflage seen in the original PlayStation game, and the sculpt is identical to the standard Solid Snake figure.

Dr Hal "Otacon" Emmerich
$14.67 ($20)
Everyone's favorite scientist Otaku, Otacon sports his signature hair style, labcoat, and glasses. There's even a little identity tag with printed details on it.

Genome Soldier
$11.30 ($17)
A good Metal Gear Solid collection needs a few Genome Soldiers, and you can build your own private army with these FOX Hound duckies. They're dressed for arctic warfare, are armed with FAMAS rifles, and you can even grab one that has been placed into a high state of alert.

Grey Fox/Cyborg Ninja
$17 (was $30)
The mysterious Cyborg Ninja was eventually revealed to be Solid Snake's old friend Grey Fox in Metal Gear Solid, and now you can bring him to life with this highly detailed duckie. It's equipped with a helmet and armor that's based off of the original character, armed with a sharp sword, and the armor has a metallic gradient finish that makes it stand out in any collection.

Revolver Ocelot (Bathtub)
$20
Based on his appearance in Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, young Revolver Ocelot looks ready to throw down in a gunfight with Naked Snake. Dressed in his Russian military uniform--with a few extra pieces of flair--the Ocelot duckie is a dashing addition to the Metal Gear Solid shelf.

The Orange Box Cosplaying Duck (Boxed)
$26.49
A Metal Gear Solid collection wouldn't be complete without a cardboard box, and this collectible fills that requirement perfectly. The Orange Box duckie is perfectly hidden, if you can ignore its orange beak peeking out from an otherwise plain, unmistakable cardboard crate.

Speaking of Funko Pops, you can already pick up two figures based on Metal Gear Solid Delta characters. The first one is of Naked Snake, dressed in his jungle fatigues and armed with his signature SOCOM pistol and survival knife. You can pair Naked Snake with this vinyl figure of his mentor, the Boss. She's armed for a fight and wearing her trademark combat outfit, and for a nice game-accurate touch, the figure even includes the mole beneath her right eye.Metal Gear Solid Funk Pop Figures
