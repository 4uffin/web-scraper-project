$139.50 (was $150 | Releases September 30
Preorder at Amazon
The early '90s is arguably the peak of X-Men comic books, as this was when the series was setting new sales records and establishing itself as Marvel's biggest IP. Anyone looking to revisit this age of blockbuster sales and extreme storylines can preorder the upcoming X-Men: Blue and Gold - Mutant Genesis, which launches for $139.50 on September 30. This is a massive hardcover omnibus that collects over 1,000 pages of iconic X-Men storylines from the 1980s and 1990s.
X-Men: Blue & Gold - Mutant Genesis
$139.50 (was $150 | Releases September 30
Primarily written by the prolific Chris Claremont and featuring a stacked roster of artists, X-Men: Blue and Gold is a mammoth 1,360 pages in size, so you're going to get a great workout from holding this book. It collects several X-Men series together, as well as tie-in comic books like Ghost Rider, Marvel Comics Presents, and a few annuals. During the '90s, the X-Men had split into two teams--Blue and Gold--so that they could better respond to threats across the globe. Cyclops would lead the Blue squad, while Storm took command of the Gold team, and both units took on enemies like Omega Red, Mojo, and their archnemesis, Magneto.Two spin-off teams--X-Factor and X-Force--also featured in these tales, while other famous faces from across the Marvel Universe would often appear to lend a hand. After all, who better to fend off the Xenomorph-like Brood than the Spirit of Vengeance, Ghost Rider?Here's a look at all the issues in X-Men: Blue & Gold - Mutant Genesis:X-Men (1991) #1-16X-Men Annual (1992) #1Uncanny X-Men (1981) #281-297Uncanny X-Men Annual (1992) #16Ghost Rider (1990) #26-27X-Factor (1986) #84-86X-Force (1991) #16-18Stryfe's Strike File #1Materials from X-Factor Annual #7, X-Force Annual #1, Marvel Comics Presents (1989) #89, and X-Men: Odd Men Out

While X-Men comics weren't initially best-sellers, the team did see a resurgence in the '70s and a steady growth in popularity throughout the '80s, culminating in their rise to the top at Marvel Comics. The flagship series for the publisher, the comic books would break several sales records in 1990 and 1991 during a time when comic book creators and artists were the main selling point behind a series. X-Men continued to be popular throughout the decade, but with Marvel facing bankruptcy during that turbulent period, several comic book superstars leaving to form their own publishing company, and the comic book bubble burst, the good times sadly came to an end for a few years.The influence of the series even made its way to Japan, as the Saturday morning cartoon show was adapted into a best-selling manga. This has been out of print for decades, but earlier this year, Viz Media and Marvel launched X-Men: The Manga Remastered. The first paperback volume is on sale for $17.30 (was $25) and the second volume is just $15.30 (was $30). Combined, that's over 1,000 pages of X-Men manga for just $32, covering the first season of X-Men: The Animated Series.X-Men: The Manga Remastered Deals
