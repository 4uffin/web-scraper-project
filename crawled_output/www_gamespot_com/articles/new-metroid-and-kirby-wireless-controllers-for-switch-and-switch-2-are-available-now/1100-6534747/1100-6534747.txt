The rest of 2025 is looking strong for the Nintendo Switch 2, which has big new releases dropping at a decent clip between now and December, including two of the system's most anticipated releases, Kirby Air Riders on November 20 and Metroid Prime 4: Beyond on December 4. Both titles are even getting official merch and a selection of all-new Amiibo in the near future--but that's not all. Third-party accessory maker PowerA recently dropped two new Metroid and Kirby themed variants of its wireless controllers that are compatible with both Switch and Switch 2 and make for solid alternatives to the standard Switch Pro Controller. Both PowerA Wireless Controllers launched on August 27 and are available now for $70 apiece at Amazon, making them perfect for fans looking to grab some Metroid or Kirby merch before the new games and Amiibo releases.

The new Metroid and Kirby Edition PowerA Nintendo Switch Enhanced Wireless Controllers share the exact same specs--including two mappable back buttons, up to 30 hours of battery life, and gyro motion control support. The controllers connect to Switch, Switch 2, and PC via Bluetooth, though you can also plug the pad in using the included 10-foot USB-C charging cable. While the controllers work on Switch, Switch 2, and PC, they are designed specifically for the original Switch, meaning they lack the Switch 2's C Button and cannot be used to wake up the Switch 2 from sleep mode. And like many other third-party Switch controllers, it lacks HD rumble and Amiibo support. That said, their form factor is very similar to Nintendo's first-party Switch Pro controller, with a nearly identical button layout--with the added benefit of the unique game-themed skins.The Metroid Edition model features a blue and turquoise design inspired by the games, with a large render of Samus splashed across the face of the controller, and the iconic Samus emblem on the left grip.

Again, the PowerA Nintendo Switch Enhanced Wireless Controller - Kirby Edition offers the same features, functionality, and form factor as the Metroid Edition (and other variants) of the gamepad, but sports its own unique Kirby-themed design, with a collage featuring multiple versions of Kirby, Waddle-Dee, King Dedede, and Meta Knight, plus a larger Kirby illustration and logo on the right grip. It also features colored thumbstick bases and shoulder buttons.

If you pick up the new Metroid Edition PowerA Nintendo Switch Enhanced Wireless Controller, you might want to pair it with the new Metroid Edition PowerA Wired Earbuds. They're affordable at just $25, and with a blue and black design that matches the gamepad, they're the ideal companion. And if you love all the features of the above controllers but aren't a fan of the designs (or price tag), check out the Mario Pop variant. This is the exact same controller, but it boasts a colorful Mario design--and it's currently on sale for just $36 (was $60).For even more Pro Controller alternatives, be sure to check out the Turtle Beach catalog. These are essentially rebranded PDP controllers (Turtle Beach acquired PDP last year), and you'll find several designs inspired by Mario and Donkey Kong. For example, the Turtle Beach Rematch Wireless Controller (Mario Bricks) releases on October 12, and it's built with a cool lenticular design that changes depending on your viewing angle. It even features motion controls and comes with remappable back buttons, so it's a nice alternative to these Metroid and Kirby controllers from PowerA.Another version of the Turtle Beach Rematch Wireless arrives the same day, this one featuring a similar lenticular design--only it's inspired by Donkey Kong and offers gorgeous black and green artwork. Meanwhile, the Invincible Mario and Super Mario Star editions are available right now, so give them a look before adding the PowerA Metroid and Kirby controllers to your collection.Turtle Beach Rematch Wireless Controller (Donkey Kong)Gallery
Now is also a great time to preorder Samus and Kirby's next games. Preorders are live for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, which launches December 4 on Switch and Switch 2. There are also several cool new Metroid Prime 4 Amiibo available to preorder, including Varia Suit Samus and Samus' new Vi-Oh-La suit and motorcycle launching November 6, followed by a figure of the game's antagonist Sylux launching December 4. Along with the new game and Amiibo figures, the official Metroid Prime 1-3: A Visual Retrospective art book is also launching on October 28, which offers a deep dive into the development and in-game lore of the first three games in the Metroid Prime saga. Be sure to check our Metroid Prime 4: Beyond preorder guide for more information on the game, amiibo, art book, and other pieces of merch dropping soon.Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Preorders

It's also worth mentioning Nintendo's other big Holiday release, Pokemon Legends: Z-A, which drops for Switch and Switch 2 on October 16. Preorders are live now--though fans who have yet to pick up a Switch 2 will want to check out the new Pokemon Legends: Z-A Switch 2 Bundle, which includes the console and a digital copy of Pokemon Legends: Z-A Switch 2 Edition for $500. That saves you some cash compared to buying the system and game separately, which would normally cost $520. You can preorder the bundle at Amazon, Walmart, Target, Best Buy, and GameStop. You can also find more information on the game and in our Pokemon Legends: Z-A preorder guide.Pokemon Legends: Z-A Switch 2 Bundle
