Nintendo is also releasing its first Super Mario Galaxy Amiibo figures featuring Mario and Luma and Rosalina and Lumas. The new Amiibo are up for preorder for $40 each and are scheduled to launch April 2, 2026. Just keep in mind that preorders for the Amiibo at Amazon and Walmart sold out quickly, so you may want to secure the two figures at Target while you can. The lengthy wait for the new Amiibo was likely intentional, as The Super Mario Galaxy Movie releases in theaters April 2026.Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2
