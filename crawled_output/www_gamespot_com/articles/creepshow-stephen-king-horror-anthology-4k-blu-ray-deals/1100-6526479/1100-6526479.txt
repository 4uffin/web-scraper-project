Amazon has several scary good deals on the horror-comedy anthology franchise Creepshow, including steep discounts on two exciting upcoming releases. Creepshow 2's Limited Edition 4K Blu-ray is on sale for $33 (was $50) ahead of its September 30 launch. The first printing of Arrow Films' 4K restoration comes with numerous exclusive bonuses, including a comic book adaptation of an unpublished Stephen King short story. You can pair the 4K edition of the sequel with last year's Creepshow Limited Edition Steelbook, which is discounted to only $23 (was $40)--by far the lowest price yet. Creepshow fans can also save big on the upcoming Blu-ray box set of the complete four-season run of Shudder's anthology series. Preorders for the Creepshow: Complete Series Collector's Edition have dropped to $68.47 (was $100) at Amazon and Walmart. Slated for November 11, the box set leans into the franchise's roots and inspirations with a CRT TV display box containing comic book-inspired disc cases. It looks like an awesome collectible for Creepshow fans.

Creepshow: Complete Series (Blu-ray) As shown above, the CRT TV's display clearly can switch between a red background with the series logo and a picture of The Creep, but it's unclear how this mechanism works. In any case, it's one of the cooler display boxes we've seen this year. All four seasons have their own case modeled after the the in-universe Creepshow comics and Stephen King's graphic novel. You'll also get a real comic book based on "Skeletons in the Closet," which is one of the vignettes in Season 3, Episode 2. If you love Creepshow, you've come to the right place. Along with details on the two upcoming releases, we put together lists of Creepshow Blu-rays, making-of books, and the ongoing comic book anthology series. So make sure to creep farther down for some great Creepshow deals--unless you'd rather look for yourself, in which case you can check out the Amazon hubs we created: Creepshow Blu-rays | Creepshow books and comics.
Creepshow: Complete Series - Collector's Edition (Blu-ray)
$68.47 (was $100) | Releases November 11
Creepshow debuted on Shudder in 2019 and quickly became one of the horror streamer's marquee original series. It was undoubtedly a huge subscription seller for Shudder, especially Season 1 was the best take on the franchise since the original movie.The anthology series ran for four seasons and 25 episodes, including two TV specials, before ending in 2023. Episodes of Creepshow include a pair of distinct vignettes, roughly 20-25 minutes each.Franchise creators Stephen King and George A. Romero weren't involved with the production, but a few episodes are based on King's short stories, including the show's very first vignette "Gray Matter," adapted from a story in King's excellent collection Night Shift. The 2020 Halloween special adapted "Survivor Type" from Skeleton Crew. The back half of the special was based on "Twittering from the Circus of the Dead" from the story collection Full Throttle by Joe Hill, who also happens to be King's eldest son.The 9-disc box set has a total runtime of roughly 18 hours. All 23 episodes and the two specials are displayed in 1080p resolution and support DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1. Bonus features include cast and crew interviews, behind-the-scenes featurettes, and photo galleries.If you're interested in the behind-the-scenes content, you should also check out Shudder's Creepshow: From Script to Scream, a 240-page coffee-table book with a foreword by Stephen King. The hardcover book is on sale for $35 (was $50) at Amazon.

Creepshow 2 Limited Edition (4K Blu-ray)
$33 (was $50) | Releases September 30
Creepshow 2's Limited Edition 4K Blu-ray was restored from the original camera negative with HDR (Dolby Vision and HDR10) and three audio formats: 5.1 DTS-HD, stereo, and lossless monaural.Arrow Video originally created a 2K restoration that released as Creepshow 2: Special Edition back in 2016 on 1080p Blu-ray. The on-disc special features for the 4K release largely mirror the Special Edition. The reversible sleeve and cover art by Mike Saputo matches the 2016 release, too.Just like the first printing of the 1080p Blu-ray, the 4K release includes two limited-edition booklets. These are no longer included with the standard Blu-ray and were limited to 3,000 units, but now you have another chance. For reference, the first printing has a red sleeve, but after it sells out, it'll likely switch to a blue sleeve like the Blu-ray edition.Most notably, you'll get a booklet with the comic adaptation of "Pinfall," one of the two stories that were cut from the film. The story was written by Stephen King and adapted into a script by George Romero. Jason Mayoh adapted the story into a comic for the Blu-ray release in 2016. Along with the comic booklet, you'll get an illustrated booklet with commentary from Michael Blyth."Pinfall" has never been published as a short story or filmed, so this is the only way to experience one of Stephen King's unpublished stories.Creepshow 2 4K Limited Edition Bonuses"Pinfall" comic booklet (adaptation of unpublished King story)Illustrated booklet with commentary on the filmCollector's sleeve with original artwork and reversible cover artFeaturettes, audio commentaries, and interviewsA full list of on-disc special features can be found at the end of this article. For a deep dive on the sequel, check out The Making of Creepshow 2, a 320-page account of the film's production based on production documents and author Lee Karr's conversations with cast and crew.

Creepshow Limited Edition Steelbook (4K Blu-ray)
$23 (was $40) | All-time low
Though you can watch Creepshow 2 without watching the original, the 1982 anthology is a more well-rounded collection of horror-comedy stories, so it doesn't really make sense to skip it. Plus, it's already available on 4K Blu-ray. A Collector's Edition released in 2023, and the awesome Steelbook Edition shown above arrived just in time for Halloween last year. The Limited Edition Steelbook is on sale for only $23 (was $40), which is actually cheaper than the standard 4K Blu-ray edition by a few bucks.Both editions include 4K Blu-ray and standard 1080p Blu-rays and the same special features. The film was remastered in 4K using the original camera negatives and supports HDR (Dolby Vision and HDR10), Dolby Atmos audio, and DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and 2.0. Special features include three different audio commentary tracks, a roundtable on the making of the anthology, interviews, and a whole bunch more. You can check out the full list at the bottom of this article.

Creepshow 2 Limited Edition (Arrow Video) Creepshow and its numerous follow-ups blend horror and comedy while paying homage to classic comics like Tales from the Crypt and The Haunt of Fear. Directed by George Romero, the 1982 original is an anthology film with five distinct vignettes. Stories include a murdered man rising from the dead, a mysterious meteor that lands on a remote farm, and a cockroach army thatâ€™s hunting a man with Entomophobia. Stephen King made his screenwriting debut with Creepshow, and two of the five tales were adapted from his short fiction. Creepshow wears its comic book influences on its sleeve, and King adapted the film into a graphic novel the same year the movie released. Creepshow 2's screenplay was written by Romero and directed by the original film's cinematographer Michael Gornick. Though originally planned to mirror its predecessor with five vignettes, only three made it into the movie: "Old Chief Wood'nhead," "The Raft," and "The Hitch-hiker." All three are based on King's short stories, but "The Raft" is the only one that has been published and collected in the author's heralded collection Skeleton Crew. "Cat from Hell," the other King story that was cut from Creepshow 2, was included in Tales from the Darkside: The Movie in 1990. The spin-off film was based on a TV series created by Romero in 1983. Given the timing, it should come as no surprise that Tales from the Darkside--also a horror-comedy anthology--existed because of Creepshow's unexpected box office success. Tales from the Darkside: The Complete Series is available on DVD for $27.90. All Creepshow Movie & TV Anthologies Creepshow franchise 4K Blu-ray and Blu-ray releases Beyond the collectible editions, the first two Creepshow anthologies are available for $10-$12 each on standard Blu-ray. The Creepshow franchise technically has three film anthologies, but the 2006 straight-to-home-video Creepshow 3 is one that many fans want to forget exists at all (it's quite bad). If you want to be reminded of it, a region-free Blu-ray edition of Creepshow 3 is $22 at Walmart. All three films are collected in a DVD box set for $25. Another box set option is the King of Horror 8-Film Collection on Blu-ray or DVD. This one only includes the first Creepshow movie, but you'll also get The Shining, Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile, the 1990 It miniseries, and more. King of Horror's Blu-ray edition is only $36.30 (was $60) at Amazon.

The Making of Creepshow 2 (Paperback) -- $28 ($30)Shudder's Creepshow: From Script to Scream (Hardcover) -- $35 ($50) Shudder's series also led to the revival of Creepshow in print. Skybound and Image Comics have published 20 Creepshow comics since 2022, and 15 of them have been collected in paperback volumes. Each volume has five standalone comics written and illustrated by a rotating group of big names in the industry, including Garth Ennis and Joe Hill. As a child, Hill appeared in the prologue and epilogue of the original Creepshow film, and over 40 years later he wrote an official Creepshow comic called Joe Hill's Wolverton Station. The first issue in Volume 4 was published September 17. Volume 4 #2 releases October 22, and #3 is scheduled for November 19. If you want to catch up on the anthology series, the first three volumes are available in trade paperback for $10-$15 each. Volume 3 was published in April, and Volume 4's paperback edition is slated for April 14, 2026. Last holiday season, Image Comics published a hardcover Deluxe Edition compiling the first two volumes. Amazon has Creepshow Deluxe Edition for $21 (was $40), which is almost exactly the same price as the two paperback editions combined. Joe Hill's Creepshow comic and three others are one-shots that aren't included in the collected volumes, but you can buy Kindle digital editions for a couple bucks each or collected volumes for $8-$12. All 20 Creepshow comics released publsihed so far are available in a Kindle bundle for $43.80. But before reading the new series, we'd highly recommend Stephen King's original graphic novel, which is available in paperback for only $15 (was $20) at Amazon.
