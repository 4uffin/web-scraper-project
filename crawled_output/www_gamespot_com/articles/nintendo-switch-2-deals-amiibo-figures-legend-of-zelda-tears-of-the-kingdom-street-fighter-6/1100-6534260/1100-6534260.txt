See at Amazon See at GameStop
GameStop has dropped the price of all four Nintendo Switch 2 Zelda Amiibo and the trio of Street Fighter 6 Amiibo to only $16 each. Amazon is matching prices for five of the figures: Tulin, Riju, and Yunobo from Tears of the Kingdom and Luke and Jamie from Street Fighter 6. The only reason Amazon doesn't have the other two Switch 2 launch Amiibo for $16 is because Sidon and Kimberly are sold out at Amazon.The deals at GameStop extend beyond these seven figures, as the retailer also had the Donkey Kong Bananza Amiibo for $16--it's no longer available to ship--and a bunch of older Amiibo for only $6 each, including Wedding Mario, Peach, and Bowser, Daisy, Koopa Troopa, Goomba, Boo, Waluigi, Mr. Game & Watch, R.O.B., Charizard, Pikachu, Ness, and more.

Nintendo revealed seven new Amiibo for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, Kirby Air Riders, and Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2. The new Mario Galaxy Amiibo figures cost $40 each, and one of the three Metroid Amiibo is $40, too. That said, this particular Metroid figure is quite large. The upcoming Kirby Air Riders Amiibo, meanwhile, are priced at $50. There's some nuance to the price here, as Kirby is bundled with a Warp Star machine, and Banana Waddle Dee comes with the Winged Star.Preorder new Amiibo at AmazonPreorder new Nintendo Games at AmazonNintendo Switch 2 Amiibo - The Legend of Zelda and Street Fighter 6Nintendo Switch 2 Amiibo Deals at GameStopAmazon is sold out of the Kimberly Street Fighter Amiibo, but you can still get it for $20 at GameStop.

Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom - Tulin Amiibo

Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom - Yunobo Amiibo
$16 (was $30)
Even as an Amiibo, Yunobo is still confused to see you. Or maybe he's confused that he doesn't cost $30 right now. The lovable Goron is no longer wearing the mask that turned Goron City into an all-you-can-eat buffet of Marbled Rock Roast, but Yunobo will always be always be the president of YunoboCo in our hearts. As is tradition, Yunobo wields the historic Boulder Breaker hammer in one of his giant hands.The Yunobo Amiibo is compatible with Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, offering in-game extras and a special fabric for Link's glider in the latter.

Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom - Sidon Amiibo
$16 (was $30)
Sidon's smile has become a meme, so it's only fitting the Saga of Water's Amiibo figure features his exceedingly white teeth. The dapper Zora prince wields the Lightscale Trident passed down from Mipha. He's also adorned with a bunch of flashy jewelry you'd expect as the son of royalty. Like the other Zelda Amiibo, this one is compatible with Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom.
