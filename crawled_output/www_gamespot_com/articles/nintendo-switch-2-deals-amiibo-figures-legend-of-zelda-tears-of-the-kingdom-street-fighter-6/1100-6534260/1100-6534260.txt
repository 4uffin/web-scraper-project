Nintendo revealed seven new Amiibo for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, Kirby Air Riders, and Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2. The new Mario Galaxy Amiibo figures cost $40 each, and one of the three Metroid Amiibo is $40, too. That said, this particular Metroid figure is quite large. The upcoming Kirby Air Riders Amiibo, meanwhile, are priced at $50. There's some nuance to the price here, as Kirby is bundled with a Warp Star machine, and Banana Waddle Dee comes with the Winged Star.

Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom - Yunobo Amiibo
$20 (was $30)
Even as an Amiibo, Yunobo is still confused to see you. Or maybe he's confused that he doesn't cost $30 right now. The lovable Goron is no longer wearing the mask that turned Goron City into an all-you-can-eat buffet of Marbled Rock Roast, but Yunobo will always be always be the president of YunoboCo in our hearts. As is tradition, Yunobo wields the historic Boulder Breaker hammer in one of his giant hands.The Yunobo Amiibo is compatible with Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, offering in-game extras and a special fabric for Link's glider in the latter.

Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom - Sidon Amiibo
$20 (was $30)
Sidon's smile has become a meme, so it's only fitting the Saga of Water's Amiibo figure features his exceedingly white teeth. The dapper Zora prince wields the Lightscale Trident passed down from Mipha. He's also adorned with a bunch of flashy jewelry you'd expect as the son of royalty.
