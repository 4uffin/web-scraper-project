A movie based on EA's The Sims is in the works, with Oscar-winner Margot Robbie's production company, LuckyChap, attached. Prolific Hollywood producer Roy Lee is involved as well, and now he's shared some further insight into what fans can expect from the video game movie.Speaking to The Direct, Lee said he expects the movie to be "unique." He said it's similar to The Lego Movie, in that when it was announced, people wondered how it would translate to the big screen. People didn't understand until they saw it, Lee said, and a similar thing could happen for The Sims movie.Lee produced The Lego Movie as well, along with Robbie's blockbuster hit Barbie. "[Audiences] were probably wondering, 'What could a Barbie movie be?' Somewhere in between both The Lego Movie and Barbie is where The Sims movie will be," he said.There is no word yet on who may star in The Sims 4 movie. Some may recall that plans were first unveiled to make a Sims movie back in 2007 at Fox, but it didn't come together for a variety of reasons.The Sims movie is in production for Amazon MGM Studios, with Kate Herron (Loki) attached to direct and co-write with Briony Redman (Doctor Who). It's just the latest video game project at Amazon MGM Studios, as the company is also producing the TV shows based on Mass Effect, Wolfenstein, Tomb Raider, God of War, and Life is Strange. Amazon also produces the popular Fallout TV series, which returns for its second season this December.As for the game series, The Sims 4 continues to get more updates, including lots of new content this year.
