The Lego Ideas catalog is overflowing with cool display pieces, including those inspired by real-world locations like the Italian Riviera, iconic movies like Jaws, and important historical artwork like Vincent van Gogh's The Starry Night. On October 1, the list will expand with the new Lego Ideas: Mineral Collection, which will let you build a display featuring replicas of some of the Earth’s most precious minerals. If you're a geologist, jeweler, or rockhound--or just really into crystals--you can preorder the new set for $60 at multiple online retailers.
Lego Ideas: Mineral Collection (880 pieces)
$60 | Releases October 1
This 880-piece set features Lego replicas of six different minerals: pyrite, amethyst, fluorite, tourmaline, rhodochrosite, and quartz, each of which is composed of colorful, transparent bricks. You'll also build a set of display shelves for showing them off. The display is customizable, featuring modular shelves that can be arranged, combined, or separated as you see fit.While the set includes an instruction booklet to follow along with, the Mineral Collection is also compatible with the Lego Builder App, which lets you view your project from a variety of angles and saves your progress after each step.Preorders are available for $60 at Amazon, Lego Store, Walmart, and Target. Keep in mind that, while the set releases on October 1, both Amazon and the Lego Store likely won’t ship in time to have it in your hands by that date. Instead, expect it to arrive a few days later. Free shipping is available at most retailers.

If you’re looking for other Lego sets to pair with the upcoming Mineral Collection, consider one of the many Lego Botanicals kits. The line includes numerous model kits based on flowers and other plants that could go well with the new minerals set. Even better, many are currently discounted at Amazon. Some are themed around a specific plant and include Lego vases to display them in, such as the 608-piece Mini Orchid or the 327-piece Plum Blossom, both of which are on sale for $24 apiece (normally $30 each). If you'd like a bigger centerpiece, consider kits like the Succulents set that's available for $40 (was $50), the Wildflower Bouquet for $48 (was $60), or the Bouquet of Roses for $48 (was $60).
