Batman fans can now build the most notorious place in Gotham City out of Lego bricks: Arkham Asylum. The massive 2,953-piece Batman display model launched this week exclusively at the Lego Store for $300. The highly detailed recreation of Arkham Asylum includes 16 minifigures and has a modular design that allows it to double as a 24-day, buildable Advent Calendar--though it's far more expensive than Lego's newly released 2025 Advent Calendars.Check out the new Lego DC Batman: Arkham Asylum model as well as deals on cheaper Caped Crusader Lego sets below.

Though Lego DC Arkham Asylum isn't officially categorized as an Advent Calendar, the build is seemingly a great fit for one-piece-per-day setup of the popular holiday countdown calendars. You can build one chunk of the building each day for 24 days. Considering it comes with sprawling collection of 16 Batman heroes and villains as minifigures, you'll get a new character most days, too.Here's the full list of minifigures included with Lego DC Batman Arkham Asylum:BatmanRobinBatwomanCatwomanBatwingThe JokerHarley QuinnThe RiddlerThe PenguinBaneMr. FreezePoison IvyScarecrowKiller CrocSecurity Guard (x2)You can, of course, completely ignore the Advent Calendar approach and build the entire set in one weekend. The full three-story asylum is 10.23 x 9.84 x 12.59 inches. If that sounds a bit small based on the piece count, it's because this is more densely packed with a huge emphasis on the rooms inside. Plus, unlike some Lego sets that don't have exterior walls around the sides and back, Arkham Asylum is a complete structure.After finishing the build, you can separate the three floors to show off and make changes to the furnished rooms and holding cells. Sections on each floor are designed to be easily removable, too. Prison cell doors can swing open with the press of a button, and you can let the villains decorate their cells with 65 stickers pulled from Batman lore.All of the minifigures come wit transparent stands that attach to the building or front yard. The stands are designed to create active poses, as if you paused a movie.The build also comes with an Arkham Asylum inmate transport van. In the promotional images, the van is operated by Harley Quinn, who is clearly on the verge of successfully breaking Joker out of the hospital.

A 909-piece recreation of Batman Forever's unique Batmobile launched in August for $100. It's one of many Batman Lego sets that focus on the Batmobile or one of his other stylish rides like the Bat-Pod from The Dark Knight Trilogy. The Bat-Pod is available in a pretty awesome set with a Batman Construction Figure for $45 (was $65) at Amazon. Batman: You can also save 20% on the Batmobile Tumbler from The Dark Knight and the Batmobile from Batman: The Animated Series.The Arkham Asylum set is one of the most elaborate Batman Lego sets in the current lineup. It doesn't have the most pieces, though. That honor goes to Batman: The Animated Series Gotham City, a large piece of 3D wall art featuring the skyline. It retails for the same $300 price as Arkham Asylum, but it has 4,210 pieces. The Arkham Asylum build is more dynamic, though, as 3D art pieces like Gotham City have high piece counts partly because of all of the tiny bricks that create the backdrops.Walmart had the Lego Gotham City wall art for $267 last week for its Bricktember Sale but has since sold out. Amazon is offering a slight discount that drops the price to $288.If you want to revisit the trio of Lego Batman video games, check out the Lego Worlds Collide 2025 Humble Bundle. The PC game bundle comes with 17 Lego video games for only $15, including all three Batman titles and Lego DC Super-Villains.
