We're just one week away from the launch of the Game Boy--Lego's recreation of the original Game Boy handheld, that is. Preorders for the highly anticipated Nintendo Lego set have largely been sold out for over a month at this point. Last week, you could only preorder at the Lego Store, but now those units are gone, too. Thankfully, Walmart just restocked the Lego Game Boy. As of September 24, preorders are sold out at all other major retailers: Amazon, Target, Best Buy, and GameStop. The 421-piece replica of Nintendo's classic Game Boy handheld is $60 and releases October 1.The brick-built Game Boy is almost exactly the same size as the handheld that quickly became a worldwide sensation when it hit store shelves in Japan and North America in 1989. This looks like an awesome display piece, and retro Nintendo fans are sure to appreciate the nostalgic interactive elements. Lego Game Boy (72046) Part of Lego's display model series geared toward adult builders and collectors, the Game Boy building kit was teased in January and fully unveiled at San Diego Comic-Con in July. The Game Boy is tied with the Super Mario Piranha Plant as the most affordable display model in the Lego Nintendo lineup. It will be the eighth Nintendo-themed kit designed for adults since the pair kicked off their partnership with a replica of the Nintendo Entertainment System.

Lego's Game Boy looks like an authentic homage to the Game Boy DMG, all the way down to the font of "Dot Matrix with Stereo Sound" on the screen lens and the colors of the A/B buttons, D-pad, and Start/Select buttons. The switches and dials on the top and sides of handheld are located right where you'd expect them: power switch on the top left, contrast wheel on the left side next to the battery indicator light, volume dial across from it on the right, and the 3.5mm audio jack on the bottom.The brick-built Lego Game Boy measures 5.5 x 3.5 x 1 inches, which is very close to the dimensions of the real Game Boy DMG (5.8 x 3.5 x 1.3 inches). Lego's Game Boy can be displayed at an upright angle by connecting it to the buildable black stand shown above.Along with the Game Boy itself and a buildable stand, the set includes replica Game Paks (cartridges) of two timeless classics: Super Mario Land (1989) and The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening (1993). The cartridges can be loaded into the Game Pak slot just like a real Game Boy. You can display the other cartridge on a second buildable stand.The Game Boy doesn't have any electronics, so it won't interact with Lego Super Mario figures, but it does have a cool trick that makes it appear like a functioning Game Boy. The set comes with three swappable lenticular screens: the boot screen that greets you each time you flip the power switch, a still from World 1-1 of Super Mario Land, and the cutscene in Link's Awakening where you sit next to Marin on a log and have a pretty strange (one-sided) conversation. Tilting the Game Boy creates the illusion of movement, so the the Nintendo logo slides down the screen just like the real boot sequence; Mario moves across the side-scrolling level; and the memorable Link's Awakening cutscene (briefly) comes to life.

The Lego Game Boy's interactive features such as loading carts and displaying scenes from actual games is reminiscent of the Lego Nintendo Entertainment System. Released back in August 2020 to launch Lego's partnership with Nintendo, the 2,646-piece set included the console with a functional top loader, a Super Mario Bros. cartridge, a wired NES controller, and a CRT TV with a stand. There's a crank on the side of the TV that moves Mario through a side-scrolling level. Even five years later, the NES is arguably the coolest gaming-related Lego set.Unfortunately, the Lego NES was officially retired late last year, and it's sold out at every major retailer. A couple months back we noticed Amazon restocked the discontinued set but with an extra $60 added to the price. When Lego Game Boy preorders opened, we wrote here that we wouldn't be surprised if Amazon sold out of the Lego NES at the inflated $330 price. And that happened within days. At the moment, the Lego NES is only available via resellers, and some of the prices make $330 look like a deal.Lego Super Mario World: Mario & Yoshi launched last October.Speaking of deals, Lego Super Mario World: Mario & Yoshi is on sale for a steep discount at Amazon and Walmart. Released last October, the 1,215-piece build features pixel art versions of Mario and Yoshi based on their 16-bit sprites. Yoshi walks when you turn the crank on the side, and twisting the dial on the back recreates the animation of Yoshi sticking out his tongue.The most recent addition to the Lego Nintendo "for adults" lineup is the 1,972-piece Mario Kart set with a large buildable Mario and his famous red kart. It launched in May on the Lego Store for $170 and arrived at major retailers in July. Check out our Mario & Standard Kart review for more details on this charming display piece.While you wait for the Lego Game Boy to arrive, you could warm-up by building the 540-piece Piranha Plant from Super Mario Bros.

The other big one is Lego Icons: Atari 2600, a wonderful 2,532-piece build that authentically captures Atari's legendary home console. Unfortunately, Lego discontinued the Atari 2600 last year--but Amazon restocked it in September for retail price, so grab one while you can.The Lego Icons: Pac-Man Arcade is still available at major retailers for $270. This impressive 2,651-piece set has a bunch of cool interactive features that make it a stellar collectible for Pac-Man fans. But if you're looking for a cheaper set in the vein of the Game Boy, check out the adorable 468-piece Lego Arcade Machine. As you can see in the picture above, this isn't based on a real arcade machine, but it still looks awesome. Plus, the Lego Arcade Machine only costs $40 and includes a gamer-themed minifigure.Lego Arcade Machine (468 pieces) -- $40Lego Icons: Pac-Man Arcade (2,651 pieces) -- $261.66 ($270)Lego Icons: Atari 2600 (2,532 pieces) -- $240 | RetiredLego Game Boy (421 pieces) -- $60 | Releases October 1Lego NES (2,646 pieces) -- Sold out | Retired, $270 MSRP
