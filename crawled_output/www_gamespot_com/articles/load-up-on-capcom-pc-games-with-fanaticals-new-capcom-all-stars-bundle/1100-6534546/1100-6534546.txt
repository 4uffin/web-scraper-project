Capcom has rebuilt its reputation over the last decade as a company that produces quality games, and if you're looking to stock up on titles from its Resident Evil and Devil May Cry libraries, then you're in luck. Fanatical's new Capcom All-Stars Bundle includes a long list of Capcom-published PC games at a big discount. The build-your-own-bundle deal starts at two games for $13 ($6.50 each). The more you add, the cheaper the games become--at three games the price drops to $6.33 each, and at four or more games you'll pay just $6.25 per key. There's no limit to how many games you can select, and if you grab all 20 of them, you'll pay $125 instead of $695 if you'd purchased them individually. See bundle at Fanatical Resident Evil fans can load up on several recent and classic games in the series, including the excellent remakes of Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil 3, and the most recent releases in the series, Resident Evil 7: Biohazard and Resident Evil Village. You can also grab classic entries in double packs that include either Resident Evil HD and Resident Evil 0, or Resident Evil 4 (2005) and Resident Evil 5. That gets you almost the entire franchise at a big discount, which is perfect for catching up ahead of Resident Evil Requiem's launch early next year.Speaking of multi-game packs, there are numerous collections available in the bundle, including the Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy, Mega Man Zero/ZX Legacy Collection, Devil May Cry HD Collection, Capcom Fighting Collection, and more. The Capcom Fighting Collection includes 10 fighting games like Darkstalkers, Super Puzzle Fighter 2, Red Earth, and more. If you're interested in checking out Capcom's earliest titles, the Capcom Arcade Stadium and its sequel aren't just delightful time capsules. Each one is a nostalgic virtual arcade with some all-time classics like Strider, Giga Wing, and Saturday Night Slam Master, many of which are retro-fitted with online play in case you feel like teaming up with a friend.There's a long list of other Capcom games available in the bundle, including massive releases like Monster Hunter World and Marvel Vs. Capcom Infinite Deluxe Edition, as well as hidden gems like Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective and Okami HD. Check the list below for everything you can grab in Fanatical's Capcom All-Stars Bundle. All games purchased in the bundle are delivered as official Steam keys. Most of the games are playable on Steam Deck as well, so you can also load them up on your gaming handheld PC and take the action on the road with you.Fanatical Build Your Own Capcom All-Stars BundleFanatical Build Your Own Capcom All-Stars BundleCapcom Arcade Stadium (Steam Deck Verified)Capcom Arcade 2nd Stadium (Steam Deck Verified)Capcom Beat 'Em Up Bundle (Steam Deck Verified)Capcom Fighting Collection (Steam Deck Verified)Devil May Cry HD CollectionDevil May Cry 4: Special EditionDevil May Cry 5 Special EditionGhost Trick: Phantom Detective (Steam Deck Verified)The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles (Steam Deck Verified)Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite - Digital Deluxe Edition (Steam Deck Playable)Mega Man Zero/ZX Legacy Collection (Steam Deck Verified)Monster Hunter World (Steam Deck Verified)Okami HD (Steam Deck Verified)Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy (Steam Deck Playable)Resident Evil HD & Resident Evil 0 Double-PackResident Evil 2 Remake (Steam Deck Verified)Resident Evil 3 Remake (Steam Deck Playable)Resident Evil 4 (2005) and Resident Evil 5 Gold Edition Double-PackResident Evil 7: Gold Edition (Steam Deck Verified)Resident Evil Village (Steam Deck Verified)If that's still not enough Capcom for you, you can also head over to the Humble store to get a limited-time Capcom: Duo of Justice Ace Attorney and Mega Man Bundle. The deal offers up to nine Mega Man and Ace Attorney PC collections, as well as a 50% off coupon on Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney Trilogy and a 25% discount coupon for Ace Attorney Investigations Collection. While some of the games in Humble's bundle overlap with Fanatical's, you can end up with a massive catelog of Capcom games if you grab both while you can. Pricing starts at just $5 for a selection of Phoenix Wright, Mega Man X, Mega Man, and the two coupons, but if you feel like spoiling yourself, the entire bundle is just $40.25.For more deals, this month's Platinum Collection on Fanatical offers an interesting selection of hand-picked Steam games, there's the Very Positive Mystery Bundle with a curated assortment of games that have high ratings, and the Build Your Own Summer Superstars Collection offers games like Death Stranding: Director's Cut, Dungeons of Hinterberg, and Arranger for as little as $7.50 each.Disclosure: GameSpot and Fanatical are both owned by Fandom.
