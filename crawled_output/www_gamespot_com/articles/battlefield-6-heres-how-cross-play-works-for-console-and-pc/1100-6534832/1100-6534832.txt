A spokesperson for EA confirmed the finer details about how cross-play works on console, and that is that when it's toggled on, the game will prioritize console-only cross-play, but not guarantee it. Players can select Cross-play Off to only play against people on their platform.On PC, cross-play is on by default and cannot be turned off. Here are the two settings and their descriptions, as written by EA: Cross-play ONOn console, when cross-play is on, we will prioritize allocating you on servers with other console-only players, but players can expect to be in a larger matchmaking pool with players on all platforms. Cross-play On is the only option available on PC.Cross-play OFFYou will only play against players on your platform (Xbox only if on Xbox, PlayStation only if on PlayStation). Joining with friends/parties containing players from other platforms will not be available.Battlefield 6 launches on October 10 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. A battle royale mode is in development as well, and it could launch on October 28. Battlefield 6 -- See 154 Explosive Screenshots From The Upcoming ShooterSee More
