Everything To Know About ArkheronThe debut game from previous WoW lead designer Rob Pardo's Bonfire Studios is finally herePublished on September 17, 2025 at 9:00AM PDT

In a world of franchises, sequels, and remasters, it’s refreshing to see a new IP from a new studio delivering its very first title. Bonfire Studios – founded by the lead designer of World of Warcraft, Rob Pardo – is about to deliver an original, PvP isometric free-aim game set in a realm full of otherworldly combat and stunning character designs. Welcome to Arkheron.The game has been shrouded in mystery for years, but light is finally being shed on the world of Arkheron and its unique approach to top-down gameplay. Here’s Everything To Know about Arkheron.What is Arkheron about?Arkheron is a supernatural plane of existence where players each become a nameless, faceless entity called an “Echo.” These ghostly beings are the souls of people who died with unfinished business, and each match starts with the player’s unarmed Echo waking up at the bottom of a mysterious tower, believing that getting to the top of this creepy structure will give them the peace they need to pass on.Because Arkheron pits teams of players against one another, the only way to progress through the tower is to defeat other teams in combat using weapons and armor found throughout the tower. Win, and your team will ascend through the tower. Lose, and you’ll start from the bottom floor again.Where is Arkheron set?While Arkheron chooses to focus on PvP gameplay over interactive narrative, the developers have created a rich world within the ethereal dark tower for players to battle their way through. The tower is both familiar and alien to the Echoes because it is the physical manifestation of their lives before death.The surreal nature of this strange dimension means that each floor of the tower is filled with different locations that are shaped by those memories. This means that players will have to brawl their way through some bizarre maps as they ascend through the tower.Imagine Diablo or League of Legends, if they took place in the dreamy world of The Sandman… Or just look at some pictures, I guess.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.

Claiming the beacons allows players to move to the next floor, also reviving any fallen teammates at the same time. Teams are knocked out of each match until it becomes a final showdown of three versus three to see who will claim victory at the top of the tower.One of the most surprising elements of the top-down game is its free-flowing camera that allows the player to swivel their view to line up shots, almost like a shooter – a unique perspective for combat compared to other isometric titles that have come before it.Players should also pay close attention to Arkheron’s immersive audio, because they’ll be able to hear other teams, monsters, and other subtle clues that’ll be vital to winning the match. Speaking of monsters: Be wary of a giant bird-statue-monster called the Fury. It’s an unkillable beast that will show up to cause chaos for everyone on the map before leaving. Think of it like an environmental event, because it will force teams to adapt to the carnage it leaves in its wake.While other typical Royale modes let players pick their weapons and armor, in Arkheron, everyone has to explore the tower to build their loadout. This means that no two matches are the same, and Bonfire Studios has crammed Arkheron with a variety of wild weapons and armor called “Relics.” Players can only carry four Relics at a time: two weapons and two pieces of armor.Each Relic comes with a right-click and a left-click action, allowing players to wield multiple special powers or buffs at once. It means you can find the right skills that work for your playstyle in that specific match. This keeps things fresh, rather than players constantly maining one character class or loadout. During the press preview, the studio showed off a glimpse of weapons like a giant ice hammer, a ruby-tipped crossbow, and a magical golden staff, and confirmed that while you can mix the Relics together, most items come in sets of four.So, what happens when you collect a full set?How to play as an Eternal in ArkheronOnce you’ve run around the map to collect a full set of these ancient relics like a supernatural Lara Croft, Arkheron gives you the option to either use these powerful items as they are OR collect them for special effects. Collect a set of two in a mixed build to get a set bonus, or collect four items of a set to transform into a being called an Eternal (not affiliated with the Gemma Chan or Kumail Nanjiani versions).Eternals are hero characters that have retained their sense of consciousness even in death, unlike the nameless Echoes that players usually control. They come with a fifth ability, which can make players even more intimidating during battle, but do come with a trade-off: Once you’ve chosen to become an Eternal, you no longer have the freedom to change your build for the rest of that match.We saw a glimpse of one Eternal during the preview called Irenna, an icy warrior with white hair, piercing blue eyes, and a giant icy spike on each shoulder. Oh, and let’s not forget that massive ice hammer that had gargoyle-like faces in it.Who developed Arkheron?Arkheron was developed by Bonfire Studios, a company co-founded in 2016 by former Blizzard Entertainment CCO Rob Pardo. Before the game’s official announcement, Pardo told the press that the team settled on the concept that became Arkheron after everyone in the company was given the opportunity to pitch a game. After that, the studio whittled the pitches down into seven core ideas, which they then expanded on further before ultimately agreeing that Arkheron was the concept the team was most excited about.When is Arkheron out?While Arkheron doesn’t have an official release date yet, it will be available to play on PC, Xbox Series X & S, and PlayStation 5 in 2026. However, PC players can try it out this weekend in a Steam playtest running from Friday, September 19 to Sunday, September 21.
