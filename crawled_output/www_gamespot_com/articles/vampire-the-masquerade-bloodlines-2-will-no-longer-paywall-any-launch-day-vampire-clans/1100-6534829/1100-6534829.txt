Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 developer The Chinese Room has announced that two of the game's vampire clans--Lasombra and Toreador--will no longer be paywalled. Both of these factions have been added to the base game, giving players the option to choose from six distinct vampire clans when the game launches in October.Originally, the Lasombra and Toreador clans would only be unlockable via the $22 Shadows and Silk add-on pack or through the pricier deluxe edition of the game and the Santa Monica Memories DLC. This was met with fan backlash, and The Chinese Room said it was making adjustments to the game as part of its response. Clans have played a major role in the Vampire Bloodlines games, as not only do they have distinct identities, but also unique skills for players to master when they align with them. It is worth noting that Bloodlines 2 has a flexible system that will allow you to unlock the unique skills associated with each faction, but it does require more resources to do so, like a stock of special blood drained from high-value NPCs. The powers linked to your chosen clan are easier to obtain, while unrelated powers from different clans ultimately require a deeper investment from you.The Chinese Room also revealed two additional Story Packs scheduled to launch in 2026: Loose Cannon and The Flower and the Flame. These will allow players to explore Seattle through the perspectives of Camarilla Sheriff Benny Muldoon and Primogen Ysabella Moore, respectively, and they'll be included in the Premium Edition’s Expansion Pass.Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 launches on October 21 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.The Most-Anticipated Horror Games Of 2025 And BeyondSee More
