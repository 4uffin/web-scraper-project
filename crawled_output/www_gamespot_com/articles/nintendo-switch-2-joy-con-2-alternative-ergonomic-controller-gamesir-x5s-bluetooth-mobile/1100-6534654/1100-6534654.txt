GameSir X5s Bluetooth Controller For Switch 2, iOS, Android

If you're looking for an alternative handheld controller for Nintendo Switch 2, popular third-party manufacturer GameSir just launched a new budget-friendly option that's worth checking out. The GameSir X5s is a $50 Bluetooth mobile controller for Switch 1/2, iOS, and Android. It can hold devices measuring up to 8.38 inches and has several pro-style features and design elements that make it an intriguing substitute for Nintendo's Joy-Con 2 Controllers.The X5s isn't officially licensed by Nintendo. At this time, there aren't any official alternatives, and options are slim in general. I haven't tested the X5s, but I have used the higher-end GameSir G8 Plus on Switch 2 and were impressed by the ergonomics and build quality. The G8 Plus retails for $80--though it's on sale for $70 at Walmart--and has a few additional features. At $50, the GameSir X5s sounds like a bargain.

The GameSir X5s has ergonomic, textured handles that should be more comfortable for most players when compared to the flat Joy-Con 2 grips. Like other dedicated mobile controllers, the X5s has an extendable bridge and silicone pads to cradle devices measuring up to 8.38 inches: Switch 2, Switch OLED, Switch, all iPhones, most Android phones, and small tablets.The X5s is equipped with Hall Effect sticks and has removable face buttons, so you can switch between Xbox and Nintendo control layouts. Another advanced feature is dual trigger modes. The Hall Effect triggers can move linearly like a regular controller, or you can lock them as rapid-fire buttons. Speaking of rapid-fire, there's also a turbo function that can be assigned to the face buttons, bumpers, or triggers. It also has 6-axis motion controls and a conventional, 4-way D-pad.With GameSir's free mobile app, you can adjust stick and trigger sensitivities as well as the intensity of the dual rumble motors. The controller charges via USB-C and can run for up to 12 hours between charges.Key Features:Platforms: Switch 2, Switch, iOS, AndroidCradles devices up to 8.38 inchesConnects wirelessly via Bluetooth8-12 hours hours of battery life (USB-C charging)Hall Effect sticks4-way D-padSwappable face buttons6-axis gyro motion controlsDual rumble motorsTwo trigger modes:

GameSir isn't the only manufacturer producing Switch controllers with removable face buttons. 8BitDo's recently released Pro 3 Bluetooth Gamepad has swappable magnetic face buttons for the same reason. But unlike GameSir's controllers, the Pro 3 comes with an extra set of unlabeled buttons themed after the Super Famicom controller. The 8BitDo Pro 3 is one of the best Nintendo Switch 2 (and Switch) controllers, and it's available for $63 (was $70) for a limited time.
