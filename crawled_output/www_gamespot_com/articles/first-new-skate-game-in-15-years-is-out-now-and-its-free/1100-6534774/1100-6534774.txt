EA's skateboarding series, Skate, has been dormant since 2010's Skate 3, but it's officially back today with the launch of a reboot that's simply titled Skate. You don't have to pay a penny to get it, as it's a free game available for everyone on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. [Update: You may encounter some issues when playing, however, as Skate server queues have been put in place to deal with the influx of players.]The version of the game launching today is an unfinished, early-access edition of the game. As such, players may encounter bugs or other oddities. Additionally, developer Full Circle plans to add new game modes, tricks, leaderboards, party voice chat, and other improvements over time. The original Skate games were paid releases, but the new Skate is a free-to-play, always-online game, with EA making money off the game through the sale of microtransactions.The original Skate came out in 2007, with sequels Skate 2 and Skate 3 arriving in 2009 and 2010, respectively. A mobile game, Skate It, launched in 2008. The franchise went dormant for more than a decade before EA announce a new Skate, simply called Skate, in 2020.The game takes place in the fictional world of San Vansterdamn, which itself is made up of four unique neighborhoods. Full Circle said the world is "ever-evolving" and that players can expert new areas, challenges, and music to be added throughout early access.While the Skate series has been gone for some time before it came back today, Activision's Tony Hawk series has seen multiple successful releases, including Pro Skater 1+2 and then 3+4 more recently. Outside of Tony Hawk and Skate, the play-as-a-bird skateboarding game SkateBird came out in 2021, followed by the skater sim Session in 2022.The Best PS5 Games In 2025See More
