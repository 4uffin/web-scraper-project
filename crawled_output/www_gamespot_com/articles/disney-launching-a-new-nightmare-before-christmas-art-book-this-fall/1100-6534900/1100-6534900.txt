Regardless of whether you watch the film on All Hallow's Eve or Christmas Eve--or both--the good news is we're fastly approaching that time of year. Even better, a new official art book, Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas: The Ultimate Visual History, is launching smack dab between spooky season and Christmas time on November 4. The new hardcover tome is packed with art, interviews, and other information on the creation of the iconic stop-motion film. Preorders are available for $40 at Amazon.
