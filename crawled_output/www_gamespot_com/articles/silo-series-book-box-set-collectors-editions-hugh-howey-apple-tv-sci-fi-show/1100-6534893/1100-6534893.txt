Get deal at Amazon Get deal at Walmart
We're still waiting for a premiere date for Silo Season 3, but fans of the Apple TV+ dystopian science fiction series can bide the time by reading the source material in a stylish new format. A Deluxe Collector's Edition of Hugh Howey's best-selling book Shift was published earlier this week. Season 3 of Silo is based on Shift, so it's the perfect time to check out this stellar collection of novellas. Shift Deluxe Collector's Edition is up for grabs for $37 at Amazon or Walmart.Shift is the second book in the Silo series, though it takes place before Wool (Book 1). Fans can get a matching Wool Deluxe Collector's Edition for only $20 (was $40) at Walmart. This deal was also available at Amazon, but it sold out earlier this week. Amazon and Walmart also have The Silo Series 3-Book Box Set for an all-time low of only $22, which is saying a lot because William Morrow published the paperback collection in 2020. And if you like ebooks, the Kindle edition of the box set is only $3 for a limited time.

Shift Deluxe Collector's Edition: Silo Series 2
$37 (was $40)
Each Deluxe Collector's Edition has new cover art, sprayed edges, and illustrated endpapers. A full topographical map of the silos is printed in color on the inside of the dust jackets. Shift's sprayed edges are blue, while Wool has red edges. In addition to the original three novellas that make up Shift, this 608-page edition has an original Silo short story by the author.The first two seasons remained faithful to Wool while also carving their own path with unique character arcs and plot beats. It's expected that Season 3 will also differ from Shift in some big ways while maintaining the general story arc from the book.Shift and Wool are regularly referred to as novels, and they do read like novels, but sections of each book were originally released as novellas. Shift rewinds the clock roughly 200 years and chronicles the apocalypse as well as the creation of the eponymous Silos.The stories are largely told from the perspective of congressman Donald Keane, who begins working on the Silo project in 2049. Throughout the three novellas, you learn more about E-Day and the global disasters that led to opening of Silo 1 in 2110. The final section in Shift leads into Wool.Shift Deluxe Collector's Edition:First Shift - Legacy: A NovellaSecond Shift - Order: A NovellaThird Shift - Pact: A NovellaAn original short story

Wool Deluxe Collector's Edition: Silo Series 1
$20 (was $40)
The Deluxe Collector's Edition of Wool has the same features as the new edition of Shift, just with red sprayed edges. Wool has received numerous paperback and hardcover editions since its debut in 2011, but this is easily the best-looking version. Fans should snag a copy for $20 at Walmart before the hardcover sells out like it did at Walmart.This edition of Wool is 592 pages and includes four novellas and the short story titled Holston, which serves as Part 1 of the Silo series. Howey also wrote an original essay for this edition that has behind-the-scenes details about the Apple TV+ series.Wool Deluxe Collector's Edition:Holston: A short storyProper Gauge: A NovellaCasting Off: A NovellaThe Unraveling: A NovellaThe Stranded: A Novella

Hugh Howey - Silo Series: Deluxe Collector's EditionsSilo Series Deluxe Collector's Editions We would guess Dust will get a matching Deluxe Collector's Edition of its own next fall. For now, you'll need to settle for a paperback copy, as the hardcover edition of Dust is very expensive on the reseller market.Wool Deluxe Collector's Edition -- $20 ($40)
AmazonWalmartShift Deluxe Collector's Edition -- $37 ($40)
AmazonWalmart Wool tells the tale of a world struggling to survive. What is left of humanity has been forced to live in an underground silo, as the world above is no longer fit for life. Things grow even more troublesome when the silo's sheriff leaves his post, and a mechanic named Juliette is forced to take his place. What follows is a dramatic sci-fi epic that sees Juliette attempting to unravel a world-altering conspiracy.Howey originally self-published Wool via Amazon's Kindle Direct Publishing program. As mentioned, he released the book in chunks (novellas), which is reminiscent of serialized novels that were popular in the 1800s by authors such as Charles Dickens. The Martian author Andy Weir experienced similar success with a serialized release strategy, but Weir utilized his personal blog to deliver the story to readers.Wool quickly became one of the early massive success stories on the Kindle publishing platform. That success led to a distribution deal for a print version of Wool and eventually a hit TV series. The Apple TV+ series debuted in 2023 to critical acclaim. The series will conclude its run with Season 4, which is expected to air late next year. This timeline could change depending on whether Season 3 winds up airing later this year or in early 2026.The Silo Series also has an excellent audiobook version performed by Edoardo Ballerini. Audible members can get all three books for around $30, and non-members will wind up paying about $40. A graphic novel adaptation of Wool released in 2014 and is available for only $11.50 (was $19) in paperback.
