The standard 4K Blu-ray edition is up for grabs for only $23.79 at Amazon and Walmart.This has been a popular Steelbook Edition--it sold out for the first time in July before the official artwork was even revealed--and has been listed for as high as $45.49 at both retailers.

Corpse Bride's Limited Edition Steelbook continues a trend we've seen more of recently by including a transparent sleeve with artwork that changes the look of the display case. With the sleeve on, as shown above, Emily Merrimack's eyes are closed, and she's surrounded by butterflies. When you remove the sleeve, the Corpse Bride's eyes open and the butterflies disappear, leaving the night sky background clear besides the full moon.The back of the steelbook features Victor Van Dort, the man who unwittingly marries Emily (according to her, at least). More undead characters are featured on the interior covers, including General Wellington and Bonejangles.
