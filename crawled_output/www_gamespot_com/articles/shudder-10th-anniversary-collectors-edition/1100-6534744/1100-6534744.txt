Shudder 10th Anniversary Collector's Edition (Blu-ray)While this upcoming Shudder 10th Anniversary Collection looks to be a great pick for horror fans who want to add Shudder's films to their physical Blu-ray collection, it's worth noting that many of the films included in the bundle are already available on Blu-ray, including several 4K Blu-ray editions. However, two of the films in the collection--Late Night With the Devil and In A Violent Nature--are available now in Steelbook Edition 4K Blu-rays, and the same is true for In A Violent Nature. These are some of the only Shudder films available on 4K. That said, several of the other movies in the collection are also available as standalone Blu-ray releases, including Mad God, Skinamarink, Terrified, V/H/S 99, and more. These versions are available now--which is nice if you don't feel like waiting for the 10th Anniversary Collection to release later this year.Shudder Film Blu-raysShudder 10th Anniversary Collection (Blu-ray) -- $102 ($120) | Releases November 11Caveat (Blu-ray)-- $29The Dark and The Wicked (Blu-ray)-- $12.43 ($29)Host (Blu-ray)-- $8.49 ($15)In a Violent Nature Steelbook (4K Blu-ray)-- $25.49 ($40)Late Night With the Devil Steelbook (4K Blu-ray)-- $40Mad God (Blu-ray)-- $22 ($29)The Mortuary Collection (Blu-ray)-- $16.76 ($29)Skinamarink Steelbook (Blu-ray)-- $20Terrified (Blu-ray)-- $11.49 ($28.97)V/H/S 99 (Blu-ray)-- $12.43The 10th Anniversary Collector's Edition isn't the only big Shudder Blu-ray dropping on November 11.
