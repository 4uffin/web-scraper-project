Whiskerwood, a cat-and-mouse city-building game from Hooded Horse Minakata Dynamics, is coming to to PC Game Pass at launch on November 6.Whiskerwood has players controlling industrious mice who live under the "oppressive paw" of cat overlords. Players will travel the seas, explore new lands, and build cities as they make the best of things while the "oppressive demands" of the cat overlords are asking for more and more. "Establish waste management and healthcare facilities, ensure buildings are properly heated and maintained, and send forth your mice to fell trees, mine mountains, and tend to the fields and fish," reads a line from the game's description. "The cats will demand their due, and your own citizens will abandon the colony if their needs aren't met on a daily basis--you must strike a perfect balance between the needs of the mouse and the demands of the cat."Players must build complex systems to like pipelines for water flow, conveyor belts, and ramps to move goods quickly from one place to another, and spend time R&D efforts to find new technologies to "bring a bright future for mousekind.""There's only so far a mouse can be pushed before it must push back--the demands of the cat grow more unreasonable by the day, and they care not for the suffering with which these demands are met," reads a line from the game's description. "Come rain or shine, the shipments must be fulfilled to feline satisfaction lest they call upon their henchmen to violently remind you of your duties. Will you forever serve this oppressive paw? Or will you raise your whiskers in defiance?"In other news, an Xbox boss recently said Game Pass is getting its "largest investment" to date this year, amid criticisms of the service from a range of people, including former Xbox executives.For more: Upcoming Game Pass Titles In 2025 And BeyondThe Best Xbox Game Pass Games In 2025See More
