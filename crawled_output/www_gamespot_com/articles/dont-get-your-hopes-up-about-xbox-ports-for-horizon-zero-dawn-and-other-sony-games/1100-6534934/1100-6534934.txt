The console wars have reached a point where it's no longer uncommon for some of the biggest Xbox games to get a cross-platform release on PS5. A small handful of PlayStation 5 titles have also gone to Xbox Series X|S. But if you were hoping that meant games like Horizon Zero Dawn and Ghost of Tsushima were next in line for Xbox releases then you might be disappointed.A user on Reddit found a listing for Horizon Zero Dawn on the German Xbox Store. And it's not the only Sony title to appear there. Unfortunately, as pointed out by other Reddit users, this appears to be an indexing mistake by Google rather than Microsoft. Even some Nintendo games are listed on the Xbox Store because of that error.Regardless, porting games from PS5 to Xbox Series X|S may not be a bad idea. It's worked wonders for Helldivers 2, and dramatically driven up the number of players in the game. In short, it made Helldivers 2 an even bigger hit. Sony also shares MLB The Show with other platforms thanks to agreements made with Major League Baseball. However, Sony is under no such obligation to bring any of its top franchises to the competition.Meanwhile, Xbox Studios has seemingly opened the flood gates for games that were formerly exclusive titles. Gears of War: Reloaded was recently released on PS5, following in the footsteps of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Sea of Thieves, and Forza Horizon 5. Microsoft hasn't put all of its AAA games on PS5 yet, but it's no longer out of the question for franchises like Halo to eventually make the leap as well.The Best Xbox Series X Games In 2025See More
