Did you know that you can play Roblox with a VR headset? It's not a widely known feature, as many households don't have a virtual reality device readily available. The first VR headsets required a specific amount of space and multiple wires hanging off the device, making them awkward to use.That said, with the technology becoming cheaper and more streamlined by the year, some are ditching the cumbersome cables. It may now be worth playing some of the best Roblox games in virtual reality. First-person horror experiences like Doors would become even scarier from this perspective. Here, we'll show you how to set up Roblox on your VR headset and control your character on your device of choice.Table of Contents [hide]Which VR headsets are compatible with Roblox? Connect Roblox to a Steam-compatible VR device Connect Roblox to an Oculus VR device How to enable or disable VR mode in Roblox How to get Roblox on Meta Quest Which VR headsets are compatible with Roblox?If you own any Steam-compatible headsets, such as the HTC Vive, Valve Index, Pico, or Windows Mixed Reality range of devices, then Roblox will work. You can also use any recent VR device made by Oculus, but the setup processes are different.Sadly, the Apple Vision Pro is not supported by Roblox as it isn’t compatible with either the Steam or Oculus storefronts. You may also find that older headsets that are no longer supported by their manufacturers, such as the Meta Quest 1 from Oculus, will not work.Steam-compatible devices, such as the pictured Valve Index, will take the longest time to set up, but it's otherwise worth the hassle.Connect Roblox to a Steam-compatible VR deviceFor those using a VR device that connects to the SteamVR app, these are a few things you need to configure first before your headset is recognized by Roblox:Log in to Steam and install the SteamVR app.Go to SteamVR settings.Click on the Developer Tab.Select “Set SteamVR as OpenXR runtime”.Restart SteamVR.Turn on your controllers by pressing the System button until you hear a beep. The controllers should then appear on the SteamVR app with green lights indicating that they’re connected.Load any Roblox experience from the app or website, making sure you have downloaded and updated the Roblox app to the latest version.Once you’ve loaded the experience, you can put on the headset and play the game in fully-immersive VR. You may need to toggle VR mode on or off, depending on the experience you’ve opened. Refer to that section for the steps to enable your VR device.The Oculus Rift, despite being very old as far as VR tech goes, is still a viable option for Roblox.Connect Roblox to an Oculus VR deviceOlder devices made by Oculus that still connect to a PC also need to be set up before playing, but the process is a little simpler overall:Install the Oculus Meta Quest Link app on your computer if your device matches one of the ones on the official Meta website.Open the Oculus app and go to “Settings”.Click “General” and select “OpenXR Runtime”.Download the Roblox app and update it if you haven’t already done so, then load up a Roblox experience from the app or website.You can then put on the headset to play. If VR mode is turned off, follow the steps below to enable it on your Oculus device.Some experiences have the option to turn on VR, even if you've not connected your device. This means it should work with your headset.How to enable or disable VR mode in RobloxTo switch on VR mode in Roblox, click the icon that resembles a hamburger or press the Esc key to open the System Menu. From there, select Settings and toggle the VR option on or off. You will need to restart the experience to enable or disable VR, so make sure you’ve finished what you’re doing.If you wish to disable VR, you’ll need to point your controller at the menu and press the relevant action button based on your device. There’s a handy infographic showing all the configurations on the Roblox VR control schemes page. If you’re using an Xbox controller, the menu button also brings up the System Menu.Newer Oculus devices, such as the Meta Quest 3 range, just require the download of a dedicated app.How to get Roblox on Meta QuestIf you have a non-PC-based VR headset, such as the Meta Quest, the method for connecting to Roblox is handled via the Quest Store. Simply search for Roblox and install it on your device. From there, you can start it up and sign in to your Roblox account via the Quick Log In feature. After entering it, you should be good to go.
