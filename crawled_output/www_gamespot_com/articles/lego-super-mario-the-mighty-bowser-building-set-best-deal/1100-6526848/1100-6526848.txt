Lego Super Mario: The Mighty Bowser (2,807 Pieces)
$250 (was $270)
See at Amazon
The massive 2,807-piece Mighty Bowser Lego set is on sale for $250 at Amazon. Normally $270, the elaborate Super Mario display model for adults is the largest Lego Nintendo set so far. Despite launching back in October 2022, The Mighty Bowser rarely receives price cuts. It's worth noting that Walmart briefly had it for $219 a couple months back, but Amazon's current deal is still noteworthy due to how uncommon discounts are for this particular Lego Super Mario set. The Mighty Bowser deal is shipped and sold directly from Amazon.The Mighty Bowser is one of three Lego Nintendo display models Amazon has in stock for discounted prices right now. The best deal is Lego Super Mario World: Mario & Yoshi for $104 (was $130).
Lego Super Mario: The Mighty Bowser (2,807 Pieces)
$250 (was $270)
Bowser may consistently fail in his attempts to rule the Mushroom Kingdom alongside Princess Peach, but he does own the record for highest brick count in the Lego Super Mario series. At 2,807 pieces, Mighty Bowser stole the crown from the replica Nintendo Entertainment System kit (2,646 pieces).Once fully built, King Koopa is 12.5 inches tall and 16 inches wide, so you may need to clear some shelf space to display the big guy. With the included stand and Bowser's tail, the build has a depth of 11 inches.While you could call The Mighty Bowser a statue, it's also a giant action figure. His tail, arms, and legs are posable, so you can display Bowser in a variety of different poses. In addition to articulated joints, Bowser's jaw snaps and buttons beneath it turn his head. He can also shoot fireballs to (try to) stop Mario from thwarting his plans once again. When on his stand, Bowser is flanked on each side by fiery towers.There's also a hidden POW Block, which was implemented specifically for Lego Mario, Luigi, and Peach figures to step on. While The Mighty Bowser isn't considered a playset--it's one of the five Lego Mario sets geared primarily toward adults--it does interact with the figures included in the starter courses. If you press Lego Mario against Bowser's shell, he will react to Bowser's presence.
