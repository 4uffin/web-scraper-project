Silent Hill f is out now, and the series' first foray into Japan features many of its classic staples. This is noticeable early on during the altar puzzle, the game's first puzzle sequence you'll encounter. If this early puzzle has you stumped, don't worry, we have the solution right here to help you. Here's how to solve the Silent Hill f altar puzzle.Silent Hill f - altar puzzle guideThis first puzzle won't be as tricky as some of those you'll encounter later, like the shrine vault puzzle or the Silent Hill f locker codes, but it may still stump you if you've not noticed a key detail that reveals the answer.When you reach the altar, you'll find five stands and five items, or "offerings," before you on plates. It may be immediately apparent that you must place the items in a specific order, but the related poem sure leaves you guessing. The five offerings include a vase, a paper fan, and three dead animals, each of them dressed in some kind of ceremonial wrappings, including a bird, mouse, and fish.The alter poem, as confusing as it is, reads:AltarThy restless heart betrays thee as unfit for this auspicious day.Thou must first pay respect to the gods and the spirit of thine ancestors.A restless heart leads to a corrupt soul.Only through sufficient offerings laid upon many stands may thy soul be cleaned.If you tried relying on just this poem for the answer, you'd probably have better luck using simple trial and error. It's not very clear at all. Instead, the answer is in the details on the offerings themselves. If you interact with each offering, you'll see that you can spin them. Do so and you'll notice each has a symbol somewhere on them that matches the symbols on one of the altar's stands.With this in mind, you simply need to place each offering on the altar that matches its symbol. If you're still stumped, don't fret. Here's the answer, plain as day to help you.Silent Hill f altar puzzle solutionFrom left to right:Fan - front leftFish - back leftVase - front middleBird - back rightMouse - front rightSilent Hill f altar puzzle answerPlacing the offerings in this order will immediately solve the puzzle and initiate a cutscene.
