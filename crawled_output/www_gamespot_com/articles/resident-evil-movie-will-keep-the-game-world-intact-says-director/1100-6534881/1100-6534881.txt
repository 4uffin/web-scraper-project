Barbarian and Weapons director Zach Cregger previously said that his upcoming Resident Evil movie is a "weird story" that won't use the games' already established heroes like Leon Kennedy. But he wants fans to know that this film is set firmly in the same world as Capcom's survival-horror games."It's an entirely original story," Cregger told Entertainment Weekly. "When you watch it, you'll be like, 'This is very Zach.' It's just [that] it takes place in the Resident Evil world. I don't think fans of the games are gonna be bummed. ... I respect the games enough where I'm gonna like tell a Resident Evil story in the Resident Evil canon that still leaves everything they love intact from the games, you know what I mean?"Cregger also confirmed that Weapons actor join Austin Abrams has a leading role in Resident Evil, but didn't share any specifics about his character. He only said that, "[Abrams is] so right for the role in Resident Evil."Abrams may soon be joined by another veteran actor, as Paul Walter Hauser reportedly signed on earlier this week. The Resident Evil movie will begin shooting this October in Prague, and more casting announcements should follow soon. Resident Evil will hit theaters on September 18, 2026.Next year is also the 30th anniversary of the original Resident Evil. Capcom is celebrating by releasing Resident Evil 9: Requiem in February 2026, alongside Resident Evil ports for Switch 2.Best Resident Evil Games, RankedSee More
