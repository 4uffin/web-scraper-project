The GameSpot Deals Team Now Has A Weekly Newsletter: Here's What You Need To KnowEach week, GameSpot's commerce editors highlight a handful of stories and products across gaming, tech, and entertainment.By

GameSpot's commerce editorial team has launched a weekly deals newsletter that, in the words of Larry David, is "pretty, pretty, pretty good." Totally kidding, Larry David doesn't subscribe to our newsletter--at least not that we know of--but Curb Your Enthusiasm will be available on Blu-ray for the first time next month. That's (pretty) great news. You could even say that's precisely the kind of fun news you will find in GameSpot's new weekly deals newsletter every Tuesday.Sign up for GameSpot's Weekly Deals Newsletter: Wait, you're saying the GameSpot Deals newsletter is about Blu-rays? That's the fun thing about GameSpot's commerce editorial section: We cover a wide variety of product categories across gaming, tech, and entertainment. While gaming is our main focus--with this week's newsletter centered solely on the latest Nintendo Direct, because wow, that was a lot--our small group of passionate editors and writers also extensively cover Blu-rays, Lego sets, graphic novels and manga, sci-fi and fantasy novels, trading card games, collectibles, general tech (the fun kind!), and more.GameSpot Deals Newsletter Is the newsletter written by a human?This is a good question, all things considered. I can indeed confirm that I am a human. As GameSpot's lead commerce editor, I handpick the products we cover on a day-to-day basis. All of the deals we cover on the site are vetted by myself or Brendan Hesse, GameSpot's associate commerce editor. We publish dozens of stories each week, and our newsletter pulls directly from our recent coverage.Is this newsletter going to take as long to read as this article?Absolutely not! In fact, our newsletter is designed to take up barely any of your time. Each week, you'll find one paragraph written by me, along with links to notable GameSpot stories you can read if interested. We also link directly to a few products featured in the stories. You'll often find Amazon and Walmart affiliate links--we earn a commission on products purchased from our links--as well as links to GameSpot sister site Fanatical, an online retailer specializing in PC game deals.If you enjoy the newsletter, we'd humbly suggest bookmarking the deals section on GameSpot's site. All of our weekly content can be found there, with the newest stories at the top. With Amazon Big Deal Days 2025 confirmed for October 7-8, there will be even more great promotions than usual in the coming weeks. We have a dedicated Amazon Prime Day hub that we use for Big Deal Days, so it's worth bookmarking that one, too!More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals & Preorders
