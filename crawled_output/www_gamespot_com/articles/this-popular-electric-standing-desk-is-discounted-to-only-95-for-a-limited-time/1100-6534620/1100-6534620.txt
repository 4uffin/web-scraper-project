Looking to upgrade your home office ahead of the dark winter months? Amazon is currently discounting the wildly popular Claiks Standing Desk to just $95 (was $120), which matches its lowest price ever. It's holding down a rating of 4.5 stars with over 4,000 reviews--and while it's probably not going to be as luxurious as something from Razer or FlexiSpot, it looks like an absolute bargain at under $100. There's also another standing desk from ErGear that's a bit more expensive, but it too is budget-friendly and earning rave reviews from buyers.
Claiks Electric Standing Desk (48")
$95 (was $120)
This version of the standing desk is 48 inches long and 24 inches deep. That's a pretty good size for most rooms, as it's small enough to fit the majority of spaces yet large enough to hold your monitor, keyboard, and other accessories while still giving you enough real estate to maneuver your mouse. Only the rustic brown color is seeing the discount to $95, with all other models costing at least $127.The Claiks Electric Standing Desk offers a load capacity of 176 pounds, is adjustable from 28.3 inches to 46.5 inches, and offers a quiet 45dB operating noise. You can even save your favorite heights to three buttons on its control panel, allowing you to quickly go from sitting to standing without difficulty. You'll find hooks off both sides of the desk for easy headphone and backpack storage, while its sturdy metal legs should keep it stable regardless of height. For $95, that's an impressive list of features.

ErGear Electric Standing Desk (47")
$100 (was $140)
While the Claiks Electric Standing Desk is cheaper, this one from ErGear is also worth considering. It has the same 4.5-star rating--but it's received over 8,000 reviews. Dimensions are similar (47.2 x 23.6 inches), it's adjustable to similar heights (28.35 to 46.46 inches), and you'll find storage hooks on both ends of the desk.There are only a few differences between this and the Claiks. For one, this is a standard black design, with a black surface and legs giving it a more minimalistic feel--compared to the rustic aesthetic of the desk above. It also features four programmable height buttons, giving you one more slot for your most-used settings. Beyond that, these two budget-friendly standing desks are quite similar, so be sure to check them both out before making a purchase.
