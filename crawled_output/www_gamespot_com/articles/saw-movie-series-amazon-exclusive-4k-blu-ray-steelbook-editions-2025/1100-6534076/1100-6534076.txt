Saw Limited Edition Steelbooks (4K Blu-ray)
On 4K for the first time: Saw II / Saw III / Saw IV
Preorder at Amazon
Amazon has restocked its trio of exclusive Saw Limited Edition Steelbooks for $35 each. Jigsaw's gruesomely diabolical games from the second, third, and fourth Saw films are releasing on 4K Blu-ray for the first time on October 21. After selling multiple times since preorders opened in August, all three are back in stock as of September 23. At this time, the Amazon-exclusive Steelbook Editions are the 4K Blu-ray only versions of Saw II, III, and IV, so fans will want to secure preorders to ensure they get them. It also helps that these editions have extremely cool designs.Exclusive to Amazon | In stock on September 23Saw II Steelbook Edition (4K Blu-ray) -- $35Saw III Steelbook Edition (4K Blu-ray) -- $35Saw IV Steelbook Edition (4K Blu-ray) -- $35Each Limited Edition Steelbook comes with a clear O-ring sleeve. Rather than just replicating cover art on the protective sleeve, the O-rings have strategically placed graphics that alter the look of the character featured on the front cover. This effectively gives fans two different covers to display for each movie.Saw IV Limited Edition Steelbook (4K Blu-ray) | Amazon ExclusiveAll three Saw films come with 4K Blu-ray, Blu-ray, and digital versions for Movies Anywhere. The 4K discs support Dolby Vision and HDR10. And all of the unsettling noises, grinding gears, and the many terrified screams will benefit from immersive Dolby Atmos surround sound. Multiple new bonus features were recorded for the Saw Steelbook Editions to go along with the wealth of legacy bonus content. Check out the awesome packaging designs below.
Saw 2 Limited Edition Steelbook (4K Blu-ray)
$35 | Releases October 21
Saw 2's sleeve and steelbook art revolves around John Kramer. With the sleeve on the case, Kramer is wearing an oxygen mask with a hood over his head. When you start to remove the sleeve, his hood and oxygen mask begin to pull away to reveal falling jigsaw puzzle pieces.The back of the steelbook case shows pair of syringes. Anyone who has watched Saw 2 can guess why the syringes are on the back. There are a lot more of them on the interior art.Director Darren Lynn Bousman refects on the second film in the series in two exclusive featurettes. John Kramer actor Tobin Bell also gives his thoughts on the franchise's first sequel. In addition to those new special features, there are three legacy audio commentaries, and several other behind-the-scenes featurettes.Saw 2 Bonus FeaturesAudio commentary with director Darren Lynn Bousman and actors Donnie Wahlberg and Beverley MitchellAudio commentary with Darren Lynn Bousman, production designer David Hackl, and editor Kevin GreutertAudio commentary with executive producer James Wan and writer Leigh WhannellThe Scott Tibbs DocumentaryThe Story Behind the StoryGregg Hoffman: In MemoriamBits and Pieces: The Props of Saw 2Zombie: A Short Student Film by Darren Lynn BousmanNew Blood: Director Darren Lynn Bousman Looks Back (Exclusive)Appreciating Life: Actor Tobin Bell on Saw 2 (Exclusive)Establishing Shot with Darren Lynn Bousman (Exclusive)Theatrical Trailer (Exclusive)

Saw III Limited Edition Steelbook (4K Blu-ray)
$35 | Releases October 21
Saw 3's sleeve art showcases the creepy pig mask worn by a certain character in the early movies. When you remove the slipcase, the person beneath the mask is revealed, so you probably don't want to show the case art to a friend who hasn't watched it yet. The back of the steelbook case shows Jigsaw in a doorway, ready to ride his tricycle down the ramp and play a game.Actor Tobin Bell and director Darren Lynn Bousman provide their thoughts on the third film in separate featurettes. If you like listening to the cast and crew of your favorite films talk about each scene, you'll appreciate that the third film has a trio of legacy audio commentaries from previous Blu-ray and DVD releases. You can also take a closer look at the production with behind-the-scenes features about the traps and props as well as the writing.Saw 3 Bonus ContentAudio commentary with director Darren Lynn Bousman, writer Leigh Whannell, and executive producers Peter Block and Jason ConstantineAudio commentary with producers Oren Koules and Mark BurgAudio commentary with Darren Lynn Bousman, editor Kevin Greutert, and cinematographer David A.

Saw IV Limited Edition Steelbook (4K Blu-ray)

Saw 4's Limited Edition Steelbook might have the best cover of the three. A giant Billy the Puppet mask is illustrated on the front and back of the steelbook. Billy's eyes can change colors thanks to the illustrated mechanisms on the O-ring sleeve. The interior art shows the cluttered workbench where Jigsaw tinkers with his contraptions and records tapes.Special features include a pair of legacy audio commentaries, behind-the-scenes clips discussing the props and traps, and two new featurettes. Director Darren Lynn Bousman reflects on the film, and John Kramer actor Tobin Bell is interviewed.Saw 4 Bonus ContentAudio commentary with director Darren Lynn Bousman and actor Lyriq BentAudio commentary with producers Oren Koules and Mark Burg, and executive producers Peter Block and Jason ConstantineDarren's video diaryThe Traps of Saw 4The Props of Saw 4Saw 4 Music Video by X JapanBonus deleted scenesGame Over: Darren Lynn Bousman Looks Back (Exclusive)My Work Will Continue: Tobin Bell on Saw 4 (Exclusive)Theatrical Trailer (Exclusive)

It would've been cool to get a new Steelbook Edition for the first movie, but it's understandable why it's missing. The Unrated edition of Saw released on 4K Blu-ray back in 2021, and you can grab a copy of the 2004 horror classic for $14.79 at Amazon.The only other films in the series with 4K Blu-ray editions are the three newest entires: Jigsaw (Saw VIII), Spiral (Saw IX), and Saw X. The 10th film in the series actually takes place between Saw and Saw II, so Saw X would be a good one to rewatch in the coming weeks while you wait for your preorders to arrive. Spiral, meanwhile, is a spin-off starring Chris Rock that can be watched on its own--though it's not very good. Like Spiral, the 2017 film Jigsaw takes place well after the events of the original seven-film series--10 years later, in this case--and is largely self-contained. That said, you'd enjoy Jigsaw more if you watch the original series first.Saw Movies on 4K Blu-raySaw -- $14.79 ($23)Saw Limited Edition -- $58.48Saw II Steelbook Edition -- $35 | October 21Saw III Steelbook Edition -- $35 | October 21Saw IV Steelbook Edition -- $35 | October 21Saw 8: Jigsaw -- $16 ($35)Saw 9: Spiral -- $12 ($23)Saw X -- $18.77 ($30)Saw Movie Blu-ray Box Sets & Standalone Blu-raysSaw 10-Film Collection (Blu-ray) / Saw 7-Film Collection (Blu-ray)Blu-ray and DVD Box Sets:Saw: 10-Film Collection (Blu-ray + DVD) -- $40 ($65)Saw: 8-Film Collection (Blu-ray + DVD) -- $18 ($25)Saw: 8-Film Collection (DVD) -- $11.39Saw: 7-Film Collection (Blu-ray) -- $18 ($20)Saw: 7-Film Collection (DVD) -- $8.86 ($15)If you pick up the trio of preorders and the existing four Saw movies on 4K Blu-ray, you're left with only three gaps in your collection. You could wait for 4K restorations of Saw V, VI, and The Final Chapter to arrive, as this seems likely now that more than just the first movie is on 4K. But if you don't want to wait, we'd recommend either the standalone Blu-ray editions or the 10-Film Collection. Saw V, Saw VI, and The Final Chapter are $15 or less on 1080p Blu-ray, and the Saw 10-Film Collection is available for $40 (was $65).For an even cheaper option, you could grab those three movies as part of the Saw 7-Film Collection for only $18, but if you're accustomed to watching the series on 4K Blu-ray, you may be disappointed in the video quality. The collection has seven movies, but it only comes with three Blu-ray discs, so multiple films are compressed onto each disc. You will also miss out on bonus features and some menu/setup options.The Saw 8-Film Collection is normally sold for $25, but Amazon has it for only $18 right now, so you may want to opt for this one instead. This nine-disc set comes with four Blu-rays and five DVDs. Jigsaw is presented on its own Blu-ray disc and DVD, and special features are included on a bonus disc--but only for Jigsaw. The other three Blu-ray discs mirror the 7-Film Collection.
Saw 10-Film Collection: 20th Anniversary Edition (Blu-ray)
$40 (was $65)
See at Amazon
While not perfect, the Saw 10-Film Collection is certainly the best option when it comes to box sets--and not just because it includes all 10 films. Released last spring to celebrate the franchise's 20th anniversary, the 10-Film Collection comes with 23 discs. Unlike the older Blu-ray box sets, each movie is pressed onto its own 1080p Blu-ray disc and DVD. That means you don't have to worry about overly compressed video files, and you'll have access to the special features from the standalone Blu-ray and DVD releases. The first three Saw movies also have extra special features DVDs, which is why the total number of discs is 23 instead of 20. You'll also find four collectible art cards in the box. The discs are stored in an oversized plastic case, and the set is packaged in a cardboard box featuring one of Jigsaw's ruthless contraptions on the front.Saw V / Saw VI / Saw VII Unrated on Blu-rayWe'd recommend the 7-Film and 8-Film Collections to those who simply want to watch all of the movies and aren't terribly concerned about special features and the differences between 4K and 1080p. The 7-Film Collection breaks down to less than $3 per film, so it's quite the bargain even as a bare-bones box set. And if you're only really interested in Saw's original storyline, the $20 collection has the Unrated editions of the mainline arc, from the franchise's 2004 debut through 2010's Saw 3D, otherwise known as The Final Chapter.That said, even if you are one of the Saw fans who considers the series a seven-movie series that ended in 2010, the 8-Film Collection for $25 might be worth it to you purely to also have DVD versions of each film.Complete Saw Series on 1080p Blu-rayAs mentioned, all 10 movies are also available as standalone 1080p Blu-rays. The Unrated editions of the seven mainline movies retail for $15 each and have matching cases with artwork showcasing one of of Jigsaw's games from the movie. Bonus content varies from one of Jigsaw's games to the next, but the series has audio commentaries, making-of featurettes, retrospectives, short films, and other fascinating behind-the-scenes content. The modern trio of Saw movies are also on standard Blu-ray for cheap, though the cases sadly don't match the originals.Saw -- $10.81 ($15)Saw II -- $15Saw III -- $11.67 ($15)Saw IV -- $8.33 ($15)Saw V -- $14.49 ($15)Saw VI -- $8 ($15)Saw: The Final Chapter -- $15Jigsaw -- $9.24 ($15)Spiral -- $12 ($20)Saw X -- $10 ($20) See full series at Amazon Saw fans may also be interested in the upcoming Billy the Puppet Funko Pop. The exceedingly creepy vinyl figure comes with its signature tricycle. You can preorder Billy the Puppet's Funko Pop for $15 ahead of its September 27 release.
