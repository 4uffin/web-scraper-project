See at Amazon
New Nintendo Switch 2 owners can save on one of the most popular travel cases at Amazon. Tomtoc's form-fitting, hardshell case is on sale for as low as $29.59 (was $37) for a limited time. If you recently purchased a Switch 2 or if you're planning on getting the upcoming Pokemon Legends: Z-A Switch 2 Bundle, Tomtoc's sleek carrying case is consistently one of the top sellers for Nintendo's new console. Take a closer look at Tomtoc's signature case as well as two other Switch 2 travel bags from the accessory manufacturer below.First-party Nintendo Switch 2 travel cases are almost always sold out, but if you'd prefer an officially licensed option, we'd recommend RDS Industries Game Traveler series. You can get the Game Traveler Deluxe Switch 2 case for $20, and the full system case with room for the dock and multiple accessories is just $40.
Tomtoc Hardshell Carrying Case for Nintendo Switch 2
$29.59 (was $37) | Limited-Time Deal
The Switch 2 version of Tomtoc's signature design, this hardshell case offers a form-fitting, sleek design. Tomtoc used water-resistant felt materials to provide a soft feel on both the outside and inside of the case. The case has shock-absorbing cushions and is built with lightweight materials that are sturdier than EVA. If you prefer slim carrying cases, Tomtoc makes one of the best options around.Other useful features include a sturdy buckle, an adjustable wrist-strap that can also double as a handle, and slots for storing up to 12 game cards.The $29.59 deal is only available for the black version of the case, but several other models are on sale, including gray and white for $30.59 each. Several colorful editions like Ocean Blue and Cherry Blossom are discounted to $31.44. There are 12 color options in all; here are the ones with notable limited-time deals:Black -- $29.59 ($37)Gray -- $30.59 ($37)White -- $30.59 ($37)Matcha Green -- $31.44 ($37)Ocean Blue -- $31.44 ($37)Cherry Blossom -- $31.44 ($37)Iris Purple -- $31.44 ($37)

Tomtoc Crossbody Sling Bag for Nintendo Switch 2
$42.49 (was $50)
Tomtoc also makes a crossbody bag designed with the Nintendo Switch 2 in mind. Constructed from lightweight materials, the Tomtoc Crossbody Sling Bag has storage space for the Switch 2 console and several accessories. The dedicated compartment for the console is lined with EVA to shield against collisions while also boasting a soft lining to protect the Switch 2's display from scratches--though we'd still recommend grabbing an amFilm auto-alignment screen protector.The Crossbody Sling Bag also has enough space for the Switch 2 Pro Controller or another comparable model, up to eight game cards, and an AC adapter. It also has two mesh pockets that can be used to store extra cables, earbuds, and other small accessories.The bag measures 12.32 x 5.91 x 3.66 inches and comes with an adjustable strap with two buckles.Three color options are available: black, two-tone gray, and red and white. All three editions are on sale for $42.49 (was $50).

Tomtoc Shoulder Bag for Nintendo Switch 2 & Steam Deck
$45 (was $53)
If you have multiple large gaming handhelds, Tomtoc also offers a bag that is shaped to hold a Switch 2 or one of several mobile PC gaming handhelds like the Steam Deck or ROG Ally X. This plush shoulder bag has a removable EVA insert designed to protect your handheld from drops as well as plenty of space for accessories. Unlike the two options above, this Tomtoc bag isn't a recent release, but it's worth mentioning here because of its versatility and standing as one of Tomtoc's most popular travel bags.
