Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell Novels
Catch up on the story ahead of Netflix's new animated series
See at Amazon
It’s been a while since we saw a new entry in the Splinter Cell series, but fans can look forward to the return of Sam Fisher when he sneaks onto Netflix with a fresh animated series on October 14. Liev Schreiber (Ray Donovan, Logan) will voice the Third Echelon operative for its eight-episode run, and if you’re excited about the upcoming series, but have already played through the stealth-action video game series, consider checking out the classic Tom Clancy Splinter Cell novels that both the video games and the new Netflix animated series are based on. Better yet, many of the books are discounted at Amazon, making now the ideal time to dive into the espionage thriller series. See all Splinter Cell novels at Amazon Like many other books, video games, or TV series bearing the late author's name, Tom Clancy never actually wrote any of the Splinter Cell books. Instead, they’re written by David Michaels, Peter Telep, and other popular authors who follow a similar format to Clancy's earlier works.If you’re just getting started, it makes sense to start with the first book, aptly titled Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell, which is on sale for just $8.94 (was $10). The book introduces Third Echelon, Fisher, and the many people on his team who help him survive out in the field. Fans of the Splinter Cell video games will recognize the tense military espionage action and Sam Fisher’s morbid sense of humor. From there, the Splinter Cell book series includes eight more novels, for a total of nine (so far). The direct follow-up Splinter Cell: Operation Barracuda, while book three, Splinter Cell: Checkmate, and book four, Splinter Cell: Fallout, introduce new storylines.While the first few books are largely original stories that only lightly touch on the video games, several of the later novels tie into or outright retell the events of several games in the series--including Splinter Cell: Conviction and Splinter Cell: Endgame, which serve as the basis for the game also titled Splinter Cell: Conviction. Then Splinter Cell: Blacklist Aftermath details events that take place after the last game, Splinter Cell: Blacklist, making it a great choice for fans who've been waiting for Ubisoft to resurrect the dormant series. Blacklist Aftermath is the most expensive physical edition book in the series at $25.86, but you can grab the Kindle version for just $7.Fans will also be excited to know that there are even more novels set after the events of the video games. 2022's Splinter Cell: Firewall and its sequel, Splinter Cell: Dragonfire, see Fisher return once again, this time training his daughter, Sarah, as the next generation of super-spy, and both team up against new threats. The two latest books are available as Kindle-exclusive ebooks on Amazon. In fact, for those who prefer ebooks, the rest of the series is also available on Kindle.
