Yes, Stardew Valley is getting another patch in the future. No, it's not coming anytime soon, and creator Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone doesn't "want too much hype at this point" for update 1.7 after announcing it last month.Barone responded to fans on X about the 1.7 update for Stardew Valley after they asked for a hint about what might be included with the patch. The game's creator noted "more will come," but at the same time stated, "It's going to be a while before the update is ready." Keep in mind that this is separate from the Switch 2 Edition update coming this fall, which will include mouse controls and four-player local co-op.more will come. I just don't want too much hype at this point. It's going to be a while before the update is ready

The Stardew Valley 1.6 update was packed with a ton of additions after launching in 2024, such as eight-player multiplayer, the Meadowlands farm, and fishing festivals. In December, Barone said he was resuming work on Haunted Chocolatier after finishing up the Stardew Valley 1.6 update. The action-RPG was originally unveiled in late 2021 and will focus on a combo of mystery mixed with whimsy. The follow-up to Stardew Valley also has a shot at achieving the same stellar launch as Hollow Knight: Silksong just saw earlier this month.As for a Stardew Valley 2, Barone has acknowledged that he could make that at some point. But in the meantime, he likes doing updates for the original game. "It's so much easier to just add more stuff to Stardew Valley than to make a whole new game from scratch," Barone said on a podcast in May.40 Best Stardew Valley Mods To Use In 2025See More
