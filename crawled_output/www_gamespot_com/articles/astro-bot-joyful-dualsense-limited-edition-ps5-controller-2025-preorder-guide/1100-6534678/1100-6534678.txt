Astro Bot fans have another chance to get a DualSense Controller themed around the adorable little robot. Preorders for PlayStation's Astro Bot Joyful Limited Edition DualSense are available now at Walmart, Amazon, and PlayStation Direct for $85. The remixed version of the incredibly popular DualSense launches October 30.Two additional Astro Bot-themed PlayStation accessories are available to preorder: a DualSense Controller Case and Plush Bundle, plus a 5TB Seagate Limited Edition Game Drive.

$85 | Releases October 30
As the "Joyful" moniker suggests, the 2025 edition makes one change to the design: Astro's eyes on the touchpad match his smiling face from the PS5 game. The original edition depicted Astro's eyes as circles. The updated design matches Astro's face on the game's cover art.Outside of that small, but noticeable alteration, this is the same controller that launched in September 2024.The white and blue color scheme simply looks fantastic, so it's not surprising this controller was popular enough to warrant a second edition. It's arguably the best-looking Limited Edition DualSense yet. It also helps that Astro Bot is one of the best 3D platformers ever made and has a strong argument for best overall PS5 game.Note: The links below are search results where you can expect to find the controller once retailers create store pages. We will update with direct store pages once available.

Astro Bot DualSense Controller Case & Red Panda Plush

PlayStation Direct has also opened preorders for an officially licensed Astro Bot DualSense Controller Case created by PowerA. The limited-edition travel case launches in a bundle with a Red Panda Astro Bot plush (made by Youtooz) on February 27.

Heads up: The original Astro Bot controller sells for around $150 on eBay. Amazon says 50+ people have purchased preowned Astro Bot controllers for $155-$170 in the past month. Though we'd be surprised if the new edition sells out as quickly as the first one--just because many people already have a very similar controller--we wouldn't count on this remaining in stock for too long.That said, it's worth noting that PlayStation's Ghost of Yotei Limited Edition DualSense Controllers (and PS5 consoles) remain in stock a week after preorders opened. PlayStation Direct has an exclusive edition with black artwork, while the gold edition is available at all major retailers.
