Rounding out the From Software game guidebooks is the Armored Core 6 Pilot's Manual--a very useful resource for the latest Armored Core game, which is arguably more complex than any Souls game or Elden Ring. The Pilot's Manual had been sold out for months, but it's back in stock alongside the Elden Ring restocks. Future Press was also responsible for the Animal Crossing: New Horizon's Official Complete Guide, which released in 2023 and clocks in at 688 pages. Though not published by Future, it's worth mentioning that there's another very exciting gaming book launching October 28. Metroid Prime 1-3: A Visual Retrospective is available to preorder for $46.49 (was $50) at Amazon. This hardcover book will be published by Piggyback, the team behind the superb Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom guides--which are available for great discounts right now.
