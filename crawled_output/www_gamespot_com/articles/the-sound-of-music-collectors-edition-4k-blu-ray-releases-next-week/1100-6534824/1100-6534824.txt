This Collector's Edition includes a new 4K version of the classic film painstakingly recreated by Disney's restoration team. The entire process took nine months, with the team creating a digital scan of preserved film footage before manually editing out issues caused by warping and debris on the original film. The 4K version also benefits from Dolby Atmos and Dolby Vision. Standard Blu-ray and digital copies are also included in the set.Along with the movie, The Sound of Music Collector's Edition also includes three high-quality prints of iconic moments from the movie, and a bonus disc with hours of special features, which we've outlined below.
