Note that Hogwarts Legacy on Switch 2 comes on a Game-Key Card, which means none of the game data is on the cartridge itself, and instead it acts as physical DRM that unlocks the digital version. You'll need to download the game to your console before you can play. If you already own Hogwarts Legacy on Switch, you can purchase an upgrade pack for $10 on the eShop. Notably, the Switch version of Hogwarts Legacy still retails for $60 on the eShop, and the physical edition appears to be out of print. Hogwarts Legacy takes place well before the events of Harry Potter. It sees you creating your own character and enrolling in Hogwarts. You’ll learn a variety of useful spells during your adventure, as you set out to discover a secret regarding ancient magic and a dangerous dragon. It earned positive reviews from critics and was the No. 1 bestselling game of 2023.
