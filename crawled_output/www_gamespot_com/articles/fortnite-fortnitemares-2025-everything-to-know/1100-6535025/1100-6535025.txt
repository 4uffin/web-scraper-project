With each new day we're inching closer and closer to a new edition of Fortnitemares, the annual spooky battle royale event that Fortnite holds each October. While Epic has not yet announced this year's event, or even teased it, there's no doubt it's coming--Fortnitemares is one of Fortnite's most beloved annual traditions.There have been several leaks about this year's Fortnite Halloween party--about cosmetics and gameplay changes alike--so we actually know a decent amount about what to expect even though Epic hasn't begun promoting it. Let's take a look at what we know, and think we know, so far about Fortnitemares 2025.Table of Contents [hide]When does Fortnitemares 2025 start?What collaborations are we expecting for Fortnitemares 2025?Will there be any original Fortnitemares skins?Fortnitemares 2025 gameplay changesWhen does Fortnitemares 2025 start?We don't know, but there will be major Fortnite updates on both October 2 (for the new OG season) and October 9 (for the new Festival season), and either of those dates could also mark the start of the new Fortnitemares. It's worth noting that the new OG season is Season 6, which originally gave us the first proper Fortnitemares event back in 2018, so it would make plenty of sense to start this year's Fortnitemares at the same time. But, again, we don't know when Fortnitemares 2025 will begin. We just have educated guesses.What does Fortnitemares 2025 have in store?What collaborations are we expecting for Fortnitemares 2025?It's become standard for Fortnite to drop new skins based on horror-themed franchises each October--last year we got Leatherface from The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and Billy the Puppet from Saw. The buzz is that this year we're getting two more horror icons: Ghostface from Scream, and Jason Voorhees from Friday the 13th. And keeping with the spooky spirit, it's rumored that we're getting a full set of Scooby Doo stuff this year--including skins for all five members of the gang, and a Mystery Machine van skin. For good measure, it looks like there will be cosmetics related to the creepy/hilarious co-op extraction game R.E.P.O., though we don't know what exactly that will involve.Considering nothing mentioned in the previous paragraph is owned by Disney, which has been ever-present in Fortnite since its massive investment in Epic Games, there's a good chance that we'll see another major collab or two for Fortnitemares. Last year's Fortnitemares added several sets of Disney items, including the Disney Villains, the second wave of Nightmare Before Christmas skins, Edward Scissorhands, and several spooky Marvel skins like Mephisto and Agony. It would be exceptionally surprising if Disney sat out of Fortnitemares 2025 completely.Will there be any original Fortnitemares skins?It's very likely, since each Fortnitemares in the past has also added a pile of Fortnite original spooky skins, like last year's Lexa Hexbringer. This year, it's looking like we're getting a butcher wearing a pig mask, a moth person, and new spooky remixes of Peely and the wolfman Dire. Last October gave us a half-dozen new Fortnite original spooky people, so it's unlikely that the four I just mentioned are the only ones we should expect.Last year's Fortnitemares lineup was pretty stacked.Fortnitemares 2025 gameplay changesThe start of Fortnitemares should dramatically change both the loot pool and the season's meta--it's very likely that Chapter 6 Season 4 is three months long because Fortnitemares will be almost like its own mini-season in terms of how much it will change how the season plays.So far, only two changes have leaked so far. It's rumored that there will be a Jason Voorhees medallion, which has an unknown function, and also that there will be a mythic version of Ghostface's trademark knife.As more is discovered about Fortnitemares 2025, we'll update this space, so look for frequent updates here as Epic's spooky season creeps ever closer.
