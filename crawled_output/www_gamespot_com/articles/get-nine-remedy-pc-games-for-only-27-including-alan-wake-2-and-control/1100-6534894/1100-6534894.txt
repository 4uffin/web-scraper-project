Remedy Entertainment has made some of the best games of the last several years, including Alan Wake 2 and Control, and thanks to a new Humble Bundle, has made it possible to snag the studio's entire oeuvre for a ridiculously low price. The Remedy 30th Anniversary Bundle includes up to nine of the studio's game for $27. A portion of the proceeds for each bundle go to charity. In this case, it's Save the Children, which works to improve the lives of children around the world and to help protect them when disasters strike. You can also increase your donation by choosing to pay more than the bundle price. This is an awesome deal, but you'll want to grab the bundle soon, as it's only available through October 10.

Pay $5 or moreAlan Wake's American Nightmare (Steam)Death Rally (Steam)Max Payne (Steam)Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne (Steam)Pay $12 or moreAlan Wake's American Nightmare (Steam)Alan Wake Collector's Edition (Steam)Alan Wake Remastered (Steam)Control Ultimate Edition (Steam)Death Rally (Steam)Max Payne (Steam)Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne (Steam)Quantum Break (Steam)While the full $27 bundle offers the best value since it's the only tier that includes Alan Wake 2, there are two lower-priced tiers, too. The cheapest tier is just $5 and includes the arcade racer Death Rally, the gritty noir third-person shooters Max Payne and Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne, and Alan Wake: American Nightmare, which is a standalone expansion to the first Alan Wake game. This tier is great if you want to check out the studio's earliest works. Death Rally is an interesting one to look back on, since it differs so much from the action and survival horror games the studio is now known for. However, the real standout of this tier are Max Payne and Max Payne 2. Both helped define the third-person shooter genre of their time, and they offer a strange, surreal story that is absolutely worth a visit. The first will be quite clunky by modern standards, but Max Payne 2 holds up pretty well thanks to its more refined storytelling.If you step up to the $12 tier, you'll also get Alan Wake Collector's Edition, Alan Wake Remastered, Quantum Break, and Control Ultimate Edition. At the time, the original Alan Wake was another fascinating genre departure, as Remedy blended influences like Stephen King and Twin Peaks into a unique survival horror thriller. And this tier comes with both the original game and the great remaster. That said, Control is probably the standout of this tier. It stands as one of the best action games of the last several years, combining the studio's penchant for supernatural sci-fi and third-person action-adventure with a giant metroidvania-style map to explore. It's also where Remedy really turned up the dial on its universe-building and weird fiction aesthetics. Quantum Break is also worth a look, as its mix of live-action storytelling and gameplay levels is an early example of ideas the studio would later iterate on with Control and Alan Wake 2.Humble Remedy 30th Anniversary BundleEven though it's more than double the price of the middle tier, the full $27 bundle offers the best value. You're effectively getting Alan Wake 2's Deluxe Edition for $15. It's worth emphasizing that Alan Wake 2 isn't available on Steam, so this is the only game in the bundle that activates via the Epic Games Store. The Deluxe Edition includes the base game, the Night Springs and Lake House story expansions, and a additional DLC like costumes for Alan and Saga. Alan Wake 2 is one of the rare games we've awarded a 10/10, with GameSpot reviewer Mark Delaney saying "The mere existence of an Alan Wake 2 would have, at different points over the years, felt like a minor miracle, but for it to be this one, that feels singular in its achievements, and coming from a studio that refuses to shy away from the paths less traveled, makes Alan Wake 2 a miracle."Console players who don't yet own Alan Wake 2 can get the physical Deluxe Edition for PS5 or Xbox Series X for $50 (was $60) at Amazon. The console version includes all of the DLC plus a voucher to claim a digital copy of Alan Wake Remastered.

If you're looking for even more Remedy goodness, you should check out the novelizations of both Alan Wake and Quantum Break, both available on Amazon. The book version of Alan Wake draws the story together in a way that flows a little more clearly and concretely than the game--you can't miss picking up hidden manuscript pages when you're reading a book. Meanwhile, Quantum Break: Zero State is more adaptation than novelization, since it doesn't include that game's player-driven choices, and provides a different angle on the game's events and its smart approach to time travel. illuminated."
