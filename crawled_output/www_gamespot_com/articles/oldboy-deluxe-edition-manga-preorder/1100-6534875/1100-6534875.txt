While Oldboy is best known as the 2003 crime drama from Korean director Park Chan-wook (and the lesser-known 2013 Hollywood version directed by Spike Lee and starring Josh Brolin), the movie was actually adapted from a 1990s manga series of the same name written by Garon Tsuchiya and illustrated by Nobuaki Minegishi. If you're interested in checking out the cult-classic manga, it's getting a two-volume Deluxe Edition reprinting from Dark Horse Books in 2026. Each volume will cost $70, with Oldboy Deluxe Edition: Book One launching January 26, 2026, followed by Book Two on March 24, 2026. Preorders for both volumes are now live at Amazon.
Oldboy Deluxe Edition: Book One
$70 | Releases January 26
Both of these volumes will feature hardcovers with metallic silver foil paper, a ribbon bookmark, and a 7" x 10" page size, which is larger than the standard manga format. They will also feature brand-new English translations by Kumar Sivasubramanian, as well as updated lettering by Michael David Thomas and Kathryn Renta. Oldboy Deluxe Edition: Book One covers volumes 1-4 of the original manga across 848 pages.

Oldboy Deluxe Edition: Book Two

Oldboy Deluxe Edition: Book Two is another 848-page omnibus volume that collects the second half of the series with volumes 5-8.

If you've never read it (or haven't seen the movie), Oldboy follows Shinichi Goto, who was kidnapped and trapped alone in a mysterious prison for 10 years. When he's suddenly released from prison, he embarks on an investigation into who is responsible for his imprisonment that soon turns into a bitter quest for revenge.
Oldboy (4K Blu-ray)
$37
If you'd like to check out the manga's live-action adaptations, Park Chan-wook's 2003 film is also available in 4K Blu-ray and standard Blu-ray versions. While some details differ between the manga and the film--such as the protagonist's name being changed to Oh Dae-su, and his time in prison extended from 10 years in the manga to 15 in the film, and certain characters being changed or omitted entirely--the core story is kept intact. The movie is also more violent--and more disturbing--than the manga, with some stomach-churning twists. The 4K Blu-ray version features a 4K restoration of the film supervised by Chan-wook, and it's loaded with a stack of bonus features, including a documentary, several audio commentary tracks, deleted scenes, interviews with the cast and crew, and more. Here's a look at the full list of bonus materials:Archival audio commentary tracks with director Park Chan-wook, cinematographer Jung Jung-hoon, and actors Choi Min-sik, Yu Ji-tae, and Kang Hye-jungNew audio commentary track with film critic Jasper Sharp and writer Simon WardOut of the Past retrospective featuretteDeleted scenes with optional director's commentary11 behind-the-scenes featurettesCast and crew interviewsTheatrical trailersImage gallery

Oldboy (Blu-ray)
$25
You can also pick up a standard Blu-ray edition of Oldboy, which contains all of the same special features and the excellent audio-visual restoration as the 4K edition.

Oldboy (Blu-ray)
$8.34 (was $15)
Oldboy was eventually remade in the US several years later, but this attempt is regarded as the black sheep of the series. While Josh Brolin puts in a decent performance in the Spike Lee-directed film, it ultimately fails to reach the bar set by the Korean movie and the manga. Still, if you want to grab it, the Blu-ray is just $8 right now (was $15).

For more deluxe manga, you'll find that you're spoiled for choice these days. Dark Horse has been reprinting several popular manga series in a deluxe edition format, and they all share features like oversized page formats, higher-quality materials, and covers that make them feel like deluxe tomes. You can't go wrong with the dark fantasy of the Berserk series, and Vinland Saga is a thought-provoking saga about revenge and redemption that'll make you ponder the destructive cycle of violence. The creator of Vinland Saga's first manga, Planetes, has also gotten the deluxe reprint treatment, and this switches gears from ancient Nordic lands to the far future for a sci-fi tale about the challenges of space travel.We'd also recommend Vagabond as the fictionalized tale of legendary swordsman Miyamoto Musashi is one of the most beautifully illustrated manga series of all time, while Hellsing is a cult-classic vampire tale that isn't afraid to spill some blood. Check out the list below of a selection of even more deluxe edition manga releases.More deluxe edition manga
