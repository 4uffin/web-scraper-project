I want a Bloodborne remake. You want a Bloodborne remake. People who've never played it probably want a Bloodborne remake. It's safe to say that everyone wants a Bloodborne remake. Unfortunately, though, those wants may not amount to anything, as an insider has suggested that "nothing is happening" with Bloodborne--not even any progress on making a PC port.Giant Bomb co-owner and reliable newshound Jeff Grubb sat down with site co-owner Mike Minotti for a recent episode of the Game Mess podcast. During the episode, which was livestreamed on September 18 and spotted by Insider Gaming, Grubb and Minotti responded to chat requests for commentary around various aspects of the games and technology industries. At one point, the duo fielded a question from someone seeking speculation about Sony's PC ports, particularly regarding Bloodborne.

Now Playing: First 16 Minutes Of PS5 Bloodborne Gameplay
"Has the PC porting kind of slowed down recently? Am I imagining that, or [has] there just [not] been too many games for them to port?" Minotti asked of Grubb.Minotti noted that Bloodborne can't move because developer From Software must be involved with the project and the studio is busy--presumably with Elden Ring Nightreign, The Duskbloods, and whatever else Hidetaka Miyazaki's scary mind is cooking up. Grubb agreed with this notion, adding that it seems like "[From doesn't] want to do it with Sony." He extrapolated on this point a bit more."Anything beyond From Software would have to be involved and they're not going to do it right now, I don't know," Grubb said. "But that's my understanding of the situation and it continues to be that way. I checked in on it relatively recently and kind of continue to hear, 'Nothing is happening with Bloodborne, so don't expect that.'"In confusion, Grubb and Minotti couldn't make sense of why the 2020 remake of Demon's Souls and the 2022 racing sim Gran Turismo 7 aren't already on PC. But the one that really tripped them up was a Bloodborne remake, which fans have been clamoring for.Bloodborne doesn't need much of an introduction. However, if you can believe it, it's been 10 years since the acclaimed Lovecraftian action-RPG graced our PS4s. Unfortunately, it's been locked on that ancient hardware ever since, with nary a peep about it leaving that vault. Miyazaki has remained tight-lipped about a potential remake for the cult favorite, but he did say in February 2024 that the new hardware--namely, the PS5--could give a theoretical remake some "value."Although the value proposition Miyazaki proposed as a result of more powerful hardware sounds enticing, what this means in relation to Bloodborne is moot, considering there's been little movement on a port or remake for forever now. While a former PlayStation executive has theorized that Miyazaki is likely too busy for a Bloodborne remake--or a remaster or a 60fps update or some kind of morsel--Sony has taken action against a fan-made patch that added a higher frame rate to the legendary soulslike.It truly does feel like Bloodborne is stuck in a grave, never to be resuscitated ever again. But as the saying goes, never say never. There's no official confirmation; however, you can never rule out the impossible. Maybe Miyazaki and friends are just waiting for the right time, or maybe Sony is looking for Miyazaki to pick the right team. Either way, though there's no movement right now, that doesn't mean there won't ever be movement. Patience is a virtue.In other From Soft news, Nightrein just receieved a new Deep of Night mode that makes the game even harder than it already was. Yeesh. Good luck out there, Nightfarer.Best Elden Ring Nightreign ModsSee More
