Fortnite is celebrating the release of its new Marvel-themed Blitz Royale island by offering a new free skin that everyone can earn this weekend. According to in-game messaging, any players who earn a win this weekend in the Six Stack (Pure Chaos) variety of the recently added Blitz Royale mode will be granted the new Bug Punk Sunny skin on Monday. Yes, this is the first-ever new version of Sunny, the popular alien fangirl character from the Chapter 2 Season 7 battle pass.You can earn the Bug Punk Sunny skin in Fortnite Blitz Royale this weekend.For those who aren't up to date on Fortnite's many different battle royale modes, Blitz Royale is a small-scale mode with a max of 32 players and matches that last five minutes or less that was added this summer as an appeal to mobile gamers after Fortnite returned to iOS in the USA. But Blitz Royale is not exclusive to mobile devices--you can play the mode on any platform Fortnite works on. And in Six Stack (Pure Chaos) mode, there are teams of six players, and no bots or skill-based matchmaking, and so with the quick nature of these games this version of the mode tends to get pretty wild.It's already a pretty momentous occasion for Blitz Royale, which replaced its entire map on Friday with a new island that's full of stuff owned by Tony Stark/Iron Man--in fact, these locations come from Chapter 2 Season 4, which was the first full-on Marvel season back in the fall of 2020. But the makeover isn't just an aesthetic one, because the loot pool is also now full of Marvel items, including the frequently maligned War Machine items that were everyone's bane during Chapter 5 Season 4.Bug Punk Sunny is the ninth free skin that Epic Games has offered Fortnite players this year, and there was a tenth skin, Skulldroid, that cost 100 V-Bucks for folks who had received free Twitch drops of his accessories. That's already more free skins in 2025 than we'd normally get in a full calendar year, and we're still three months away from Winterfest, which has traditionally been Fortnite's biggest source of free skins.Everything New in Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 4: Shock 'N' AwesomeSee More
