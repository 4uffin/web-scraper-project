This year marks the 30th anniversary of director Martin Scorse's gambling crime drama Casino, and it's celebrating with the release of the Casino 30th Anniversary Limited Edition Steelbook on 4K Blu-ray. Preorders are now open at Amazon and Walmart, though we're still waiting for a firm release date.
Casino 30th Anniversary Limited Edition Steelbook (4K Blu-ray)
$30 | Release Date: TBA
This 30th anniversary release includes 4K Blu-ray, standard Blu-ray, and digital copies of the film. Of course, you're also getting a stunning steelbook, featuring the main cast on the front along with additional artwork on the case back and interior. It's a pretty striking design, and it perfectly captures the glitz and glamour of Las Vegas. Dolby Audio and HDR are both supported, which should help bring the old 1995 film to life on modern screens.Preorders are available at both Amazon and Walmart. The latter is currently offering it for $30, while the former has it listed at $35. The two prices will likely align once we have a firm release date--and preordering at either retailer makes you eligible for any price cuts between now and launch.

If you don't need the fancy steelbook, you'll find the traditional 4K Blu-ray of Casino on sale for just $13. Like the steelbook, it supports Dolby Audio and HDR and comes bundled with the film on standard Blu-ray and digital. Unlike the steelbook, it's available today.

Casino 30th Anniversary Limited Edition SteelbookCasino 30th Anniversary Limited Edition Steelbook Bonus FeaturesWhile you'll be treated to plenty of bonus features with this steelbook, none of them are new--all of them can be found on the existing Casino 4K Blu-ray. Still, they offer a good way to dive deeper into the film's production. Here's what you'll find:Interviews with director Martin Scorsese and actors Sharon Stone, author Nicholas Pileggi, and othersThe History Channel documentary History Alive: True Crime Authors - Casino, featuring Nicholas PileggiVegas and the Mob featuretteA selection of deleted scenesDirected by Martin Scorsese and adapted from the book Casino: Love and Honor in Las Vegas by author Nicholas Pileggi, Casino stars Robert De Niro as Sam "Ace" Rothstein, a gambling expert hired to fun the Tangiers Casino in Las Vegas on behalf of the notorious crime family, The Chicago Outfit. The film follows Sam's life from 1973 to 1983, during which he becomes entangled in mafia politics, the world of con artists, and the FBI's investigations. The film is one of Scorsese's more overlooked projects, earning more muted praise than many of his other films, but has seen a positive reappraisal by critics in the years since it premiered, and is now considered one of the director's stronger films.Interested in adding other mob movies to your collection? There are a bunch of great Blu-rays to choose from. This includes 4K Blu-ray versions for two of the best movies of all time, The Godfather for $19.59 (was $26), The Godfather Part II for $18.63 (was $26), and Scarface for $16.52. If you don't mind straying from the 4K format, The Godfather Collection is available on standard Blu-ray for $34.77 (was $42). It includes The Godfather Parts I and II, as well as the less-beloved--but still mostly worth watching--Godfather Part III.Outside of the Godfather trilogy, you can also grab Scarface - Gold Edition on 4K Blu-ray for $15. Starring Al Pacino as the titular Miami crime boss, the 1983 film is regarded as another acclaimed entry in the crime genre. Another excellent choice is HBO's landmark drama, The Sopranos. The six-season series is widely regarded as one of the best TV shows ever created and is credited with ushering in a golden age of premium television. You can pick up The Sopranos: The Complete Series on Blu-ray for $63.38 or on DVD for $55.And over on DVD, you can snag Sopranos: The Complete Series for $55 (was $90).More Crime Film Blu-raysThe Godfather (4K Blu-ray) -- $19.59 ($26)The Godfather Part II (4K Blu-ray) -- $18.63 ($26)The Godfather Collection (Blu-ray) -- $34.77 ($42)Scarface: Gold Edition (4K Blu-ray) -- $15The Sopranos: The Complete Series (Blu-ray) -- $63.38The Sopranos: The Complete Series (DVD) -- $55 ($90)More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals & Preorders
