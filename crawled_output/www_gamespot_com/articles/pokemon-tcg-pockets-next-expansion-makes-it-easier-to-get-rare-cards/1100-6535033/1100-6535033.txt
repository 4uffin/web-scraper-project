Pokemon TCG Pocket's next expansion arrives on September 29. This set is called Deluxe Pack ex, and it guarantees at least one rare card in every pack. However, unlike previous expansions, it will only be available for a limited time.According to the official Pokemon website, every Deluxe Pack ex pack will include "one card with a rarity of ♦♦♦♦ or higher from previous expansions, from Genetic Apex to Wisdom of Sea and Sky." Moreover, the expansion will introduce "parallel foil" cards that boast a special shine effect, as well as older cards with new artwork. You can take a look at some of the cards in the trailer below. As mentioned, unlike previous Pokemon TCG Pocket expansions, the Deluxe Pack ex set will only be available through October 29, giving you a month to take advantage of the improved rates and fill out your card collection. However, the game has a few events lined up for that time period, including a Raichu ex drop event and a special Bonus Week event.Pokemon TCG Pocket has been introducing new expansions on a monthly basis since the game officially launched last October. The most recent set, Secluded Springs, arrived in August and added new cards primarily based around Pokemon from the Gold and Silver versions. Mega Evolutions are slated to come to the game as well sometime this fall, although that set does not yet have a firm release date.Mega Evolutions also play a pivotal role in the series' next installment, Pokemon Legends: Z-A, which launches for both Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 on October 16. The game is set entirely in Lumiose City and shakes up the series' formula with a reinvented battle system.Pokemon Presents July 2025: All The Biggest AnnouncementsSee More
