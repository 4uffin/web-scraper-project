A new patch for Sloclap's action football sim Rematch just landed in beta, and with it comes a host of changes--including cross-play so you can kick balls with (or at) your friends on other platforms.The French developer announced the new update on September 17. Taking to the game's official website, Sloclap said Patch 1.201.000, which is Rematch's season one update, goes into beta on the same day, with the full release tentatively scheduled for September 23. Although one of the headlining features is the addition of cross-platform play, the team also highlighted the "long-awaited" 3v3 ranked mode, alongside new cosmetics, customization options, and quality-of-life adjustments.

Now Playing: Rematch GameSpot Review
Some of these adjustments include making goalkeeper dives "more reliable," nerfing certain exploits, and improving player responsiveness across the board.There's also a new technology, dubbed Network Next, which should reduce the latency for players with high ping. It's currently only available in the São Paulo server region for now, but the team is looking at implementing the feature in more regions in the future.Of course, considering this update is in beta, Sloclap made it clear that the patch notes you'll read at the bottom of this article are "tentative" and may change between now and September 23.GameSpot gave Rematch--the latest, non-martial arts effort from Sloclap--a 7/10 in our official review. Critic Richard Wakeling said the game could be "something special" if the team could sand off its rough edges. It appears this update is an effort at doing just that.Rematch is available on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. You can check out the full patch notes below:Matches / Core Gameplay ImprovementsMajor Changes / FixesFixed an issue where the invulnerability remains on the Goalkeeper after a dive deflect.Fixed an issue where the Goalkeeper can catch shots from inside the net.Fixed an issue where Extra Effort can be canceled during a movement direction change.Fixed some occurrences where using Extra Effort would lock movement in the starting direction.
This will still happen in some cases, but more fixes are on their way.Fixed an issue where using Push Ball would allow players to move at a higher speed than intended, regardless of stamina.Fixed an issue on Mouse and Keyboard where aiming towards the ground would move the crosshair toward the left of the aimed direction at the end of a shot.Refined goalkeeper dive calculation to prevent unwanted edge cases.Tweaked the touch distance during ball control to improve clarity and updated the Ball Touch animation.Fixed an issue where the Goalkeeper would sometimes be made to face the wrong direction under specific circumstances.Fixed an issue where the player would slow down when trying to sprint after a Push Ball.Fixed an issue where the Extra Effort is canceled during a direction change or after a Push Ball.Fixed issue where the Goalkeeper would not be able to correctly dive on an incoming ball at close range from a volley.Players who lost priority on a volley duel will now properly interrupt their animation.Minor Changes / FixesFixed an edge case when the deflect/deviate preemptive animation didn't play before the ball interacts with the defense mode.Fixed some issues where the Goalkeeper invulnerability indicator would not behave properly.Fixed an issue where a volley short tap would apply too much power.Fixed the transitions from dive and dash to sprint and Extra Effort.Fixed an issue where the player’s movement would not match the character’s facing direction when sprinting forward following a backward dribble.Some fixes to the behavior when turning quickly after using a push ball (impacts “ippy slide”).
