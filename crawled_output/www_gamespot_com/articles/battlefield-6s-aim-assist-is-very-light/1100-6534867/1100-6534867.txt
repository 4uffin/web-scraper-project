"It's an evolution of what we had in Battlefield 2042," Nickerson said, adding that the team is using "real-time" renders in Battlefield 6 to improve aim-assist.

"We've really upped the level of consistency and performance across the board. We're going very light with aim assist. We're not adding rotational aim assist; we actually removed snap zoom, which was in 2042, as we believed it was too mechanically heavy. We want to humanize aim assist, as we call it here internally."The goal of aim assist in Battlefield 6 is to simply assist the player, Nickerson said, and not feel like the controls are being taken out of their hands when it switches on."We need player input to even activate the system. We want the player to feel good about what they're doing in-game, achieving those kills, and they feel like they achieved it," Nickerson said. "Not some system or code that achieved it for them.Nickerson acknowledged that aim assist is a "hot topic" in the FPS space. "We're really excited about the solution we have, and we're focused on what we feel works best for Battlefield," he said.Battlefield 6 launches on October 10 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. A battle royale mode is in development as well, and it could launch on October 28.In other news, EA and Battlefield Studios recently clarified how cross-play works, while a lot of gameplay footage from the new map, Mirak Valley, has come online.
