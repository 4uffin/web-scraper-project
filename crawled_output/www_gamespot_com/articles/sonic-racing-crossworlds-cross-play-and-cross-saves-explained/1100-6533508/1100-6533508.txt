Now Playing: Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds - Summer Game Fest Guest Characters Trailer
All of this is best enjoyed with friends, right? Well, what if your friends play on platforms different from yours? Or what if you want to move your progress between platforms? Here's what you need to know about cross-play and cross-progression in Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds.Does Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds have cross-play?Sonic fans can rejoice, as Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds has full cross-play matchmaking for everyone, regardless of which platform they choose to play on. This means that PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC players will all be able to race in the same lobbies.Additionally, Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds supports up to four-player split-screen to allow family and friends to join in the fun while hanging out on the couch. So, whether you're enjoying Grand Prix, Race Park, or Time Attack with a group, no one's left behind in this frenetic racer. Just remember to play nice. No one likes a gloater.Does Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds have cross-progression?Things don't fare quite the same when it comes to carrying saves between ecosystems, as Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds does not feature cross-progression between all platforms. This means you won't be able to play on PS5 and carry your progress over to Xbox, for instance. Instead, you'd need to start over entirely on the other platform.That being said, SEGA does allow you to carry your progress from Nintendo Switch to Nintendo Switch 2 one time when upgrading your copy to the improved version. However, this does not work in the opposite direction, meaning that once you've played on Nintendo Switch 2, you won't be able to carry your progress backward to the original Nintendo Switch version.Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds launches September 25 for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, Nintendo Switch, and PC. A Nintendo Switch 2 version is expected Holiday 2025 and will be available via an upgrade path or as a standalone purchase.The 15 Best Sega Genesis Games Of All TimeSee More
