PS5 Slim NBA 2K26 Bundle
$550 | Valued at $620

A new PS5 Slim bundle with NBA 2K26 is available now at Amazon, Walmart, PlayStation Direct, and other retailers. Priced at $550, the bundle includes the PS5 Slim with a disc drive and a voucher for the digital version of NBA 2K26. If the price sounds high, it's because PlayStation raised the price of PS5 consoles on August 21. The PS5 Slim on its own now goes for $550, so the bundle throws in 2K's brand-new basketball sim for free.Even with the increases in mind, there's another reason why this could sound pricey: PlayStation's last couple of console bundles--Astro Bot and Black Ops 6--included a game and a $50 discount. Earlier this year, the Astro Bot and Black Ops 6 PS5 Slim Bundles were selling for only $450. Those two offers were also available with the PS5 Slim Digital for $400.Last year's NBA 2K25 PS5 Slim Bundle had the disc-based and digital-only consoles as options, but it appears PlayStation is moving away from that release structure.
