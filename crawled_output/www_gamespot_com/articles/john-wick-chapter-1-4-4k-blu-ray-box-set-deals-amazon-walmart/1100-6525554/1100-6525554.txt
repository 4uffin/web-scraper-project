John Wick: Chapters 1-4 Collection on Blu-ray
$26.49 (was $45) | Limited-time deal
John Wick: Chapters 1-4 Collection is an eight-disc set with 1080p Blu-ray and DVD versions of all four mainline films. It also comes with four art cards with pretty awesome character art. The cardboard slipcase has a window frame, allowing you to switch between the four pieces of artwork for display.The box set already offers terrific value just for the movies themselves, but you'll also get hours of bonus features, including audio commentaries and over 35 featurettes.Note: You'll find a voucher in the case for digital copies of the four movies, but the codes expired in October 2024. Technically, the wording says "may not be valid," so it's still worth trying on the off-chance it does work.If you already own Chapter 4, there's a Chapters 1-3 box set for $19.38. Alternatively, you can buy each John Wick movie on Blu-ray for $7 to $9 each.John Wick on Blu-ray:Chapters 1-4 Box Set -- $26.49 ($45)Chapters 1-3 Box Set -- $19.38 ($35)Chapter 1 -- $7 ($15)Chapter 2 -- $7.50 ($15)Chapter 3 -- $7.50 ($15)Chapter 4 -- $9 ($15)

John Wick: Chapters 1-3 on 4K Blu-ray
$28.49 (was $45) | Limited-time deal
Unfortunately, a four-film John Wick box set hasn't released on 4K Blu-ray in the US. You can get a region-free 4K collection, but it's quite pricey through resellers on Amazon ($80). It's much cheaper to buy the John Wick: Chapters 1-3 4K Blu-ray set and purchase Chapter 4 separately.Chapters 1-3 on 4K is $28.49 (was $45), and Chapter 4 is $17.44 (was $30), which brings your total cost to just under $46. The first three films are also available on 4K Blu-ray for $15 or less each.Amazon also has an alternative version of the Chapters 1-3 collection on 4K Blu-ray. Released in February 2023, this one is bundled with officially licensed John Wick playing cards from John Wick: Chapter 4.John Wick on 4K Blu-ray at AmazonChapters 1-3 Box Set -- $28.49 ($45)Chapters 1-3 + Playing Cards Box Set -- $41 ($45)Chapter 1 -- $15 ($23)Chapter 2 -- $11 ($23)Chapter 3 -- $14.44 ($23)Chapter 4 -- $17.44 ($23)

John Wick: Chapters 1-3 - Stash Book Collection (4K)
$50 (was $100) | Exclusive to Walmart
Arguably the coolest John Wick Blu-ray collection, the Walmart-exclusive Stash Book Collection bundles Chapters 1-3 on 4K Blu-ray and 1080p Blu-ray. The six-disc box set is on sale for $50 (was $100) right now. Each film comes with its own collectible steelbook case. The trio of steelbooks are stored inside a replica of Wick's stash book. The front cover folds open like. a book, and there's a window to view the steelbook "pages" of the fancy book.The Stash Book Collection was initially released as a Best Buy exclusive, but once Best Buy stopped carrying Blu-rays, Walmart nabbed the exclusivity and reprinted it last year.
