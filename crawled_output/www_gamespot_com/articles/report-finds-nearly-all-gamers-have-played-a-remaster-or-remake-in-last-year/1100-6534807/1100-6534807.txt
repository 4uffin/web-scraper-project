If you've played any PC or console games over the last 12 months, there's a good chance that at least one of them was a remake or a remaster. That's according to new research, which found that not only have these games been popular with the people they polled for this research, they've also been "desirable" diversions.Specialist strategy and insights consultancy firm MTM (via GamesIndustry.Biz) polled 1,500 people--750 people each in the US and the UK--who play games regularly. "Our report shows that there is a strong appeal for remakes and remasters, but it's a tight balancing act for studios to get right," said Martin Bradley, head of gaming at MTM. "Many of these games are far out-selling their original release."

Now Playing: Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater Review
MTM also revealed that 85% of the people who played a remaster or remake in the last year had not even played the original version of the game, so this wasn't entirely a case of nostalgia guiding their choices. That being said, MTM added that nostalgia is still a powerful influence, even when gamers understand that they might be missing out on fresher and novel gameplay experiences by choosing reimagined games over newer titles.It hasn't been difficult to find a remastered game either, as publishers have focused their efforts on reviving classic games in addition to new projects. The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered--one of the best-selling games of the year so far--Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4, and the House of the Dead 2: Remake were all released this year, and looking ahead, remakes of Persona 4, Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time, and Splinter Cell are also on the way.Nintendo has also been keenly aware of the value of its older games for years now, and while it has produced several remakes and remasters, it's even going a step further this year by remaking its flop Virtual Boy console--sort of.Virtual Boy functionality is coming February 17, 2026, to Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pass, and to play these games, you'll need a new accessory modeled after the original console that you can slot your Switch or Switch 2 device into.The 25 Best Video Game RemakesSee More
