Stephen King - The Long Walk - First Hardcover Edition
$29 | Releases October 7
If you want to read Stephen King's original novel before or after watching the film adaptation, Scribner is publishing a new hardcover edition of The Long Walk on October 7. New editions of King's books are often printed when an adaptation is made, but most of the time these are paperbacks. For big King fans who want to collect hardcover editions, the upcoming edition of The Long Walk is a big deal.This is the first standalone hardcover edition of The Long Walk sold at bookstores and major retailers. The reason for this is because The Long Walk is one of a handful of novels King wrote under the pen name Richard Bachman. Novels published under the Bachman name were only available as paperbacks. The Long Walk hit stores in 1979, but it's actually the first novel King wrote.When the author revealed the true identity of Bachman in 1985, The Long Walk and three other books initially published under the pseudonym were collected in hardcover as The Bachman Books. The Long Walk also received a pricey Limited Edition from Centipede Press in 2023.Earlier this month, Scribner published a paperback tie-in edition with The Long Walk movie poster as the cover art. Amazon has a limited-time deal that drops the price of this edition to $14.24.The Long Walk by Stephen KingHardcover -- $29 | Releases October 7Paperback (movie cover) -- $14.24 ($19)Paperback -- $15.67 ($19)Mass Market Paperback -- $12

The Running Man's new film adaptation starring Glen Powell and directed by Edgar Wright premieres November 7.

Stephen King Movies on 4K Blu-rayStephen King movies - 2025 4K Blu-ray releasesAs mentioned, The Long Walk is the first 2025 King adaptation with a Steelbook Edition, but we'd be surprised if The Running Man doesn't get one. The two 2025 adaptations without Steelbook Editions are The Life of Chuck and The Monkey. Directed by Osgood Perkins, The Monkey is a horror-comedy about a cursed toy monkey. It received a standard 4K Blu-ray release in June, and Amazon has it for only $19.67 (was $43) right now. The Life of Chuck, meanwhile, is a fantasy drama directed by Mike Flanagan. The 4K Blu-ray edition releases September 30 and is available to preorder for $27.49 (was $40) at Amazon.Several older film adaptations of King's work have received new 4K Blu-ray editions this year. The Dead Limited Edition Steelbook released in June as an Amazon exclusive; The Dark Half was finally restored in 4K in July; and Creepshow 2 arrives on 4K Blu-ray later this month as a Limited Edition from Arrow Video. The 1990 film Graveyard Shift also released on 4K Blu-ray this year, but unlike the other movies we mentioned, Graveyard Shift is pretty bad.We put together a list of Stephen King movies on 4K Blu-ray.
