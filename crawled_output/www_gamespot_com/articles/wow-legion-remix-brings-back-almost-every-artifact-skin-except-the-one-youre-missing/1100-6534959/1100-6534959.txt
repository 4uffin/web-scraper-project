World of Warcraft's upcoming Legion Remix event will include plenty of new and returning transmog options for players to collect, but one highly coveted set of Artifact appearances from the original Legion expansion won't be among them.Legion, originally released in 2016, is one of WoW's most popular expansions. That popularity is, in part, due to its Artifact-weapon system. Every player was granted an iconic weapon from Warcraft lore to upgrade over the course of the expansion. Because WoW's real endgame is transmog, each Artifact weapon also sported a variety of different skins and color variations for players to pursue and collect.WoW Legion Remix's content schedule.Now, as part of Legion Remix, players are getting a second chance at the expansion. In a forum post from WoW community manager Kaivax, Blizzard clarified that nearly all of Legion's original Artifact-weapon appearances (minus ones available only through PvP, since Legion Remix is a PvE-only event) will be available during the event. Many of these Artifact appearances are technically still earnable in the modern version of the game, though Legion Remix's increased leveling speeds and power levels will make leveling new characters for the event and blasting through some of the prerequisites faster."In Legion Remix, you'll have a great opportunity to obtain Artifact appearances that you haven't already," Kaivax said.However, there is one notable exception--Mage Tower Artifact appearances. One of Legion's most innovative additions, the Mage Tower was introduced later on in the expansion and served as a challenge mode for various class specializations. Completing the different Mage Tower challenges originally granted exclusive Artifact weapon tints. However, once Legion ended, the Mage Tower was removed, as were its rewards. While Blizzard did eventually bring the Mage Tower back with new rewards, many of the original rewards, including exclusive Artifact-weapon tints, weren't made available.Those Artifact appearances won't be obtainable in Legion Remix, either, and will thus remain unobtainable for all of those who didn't complete the various Mage Tower challenges back when it was originally available.Many players have long hoped Blizzard would bring back the ability to earn the original Mage Tower appearances, first when it was reintroduced in 2022 and now as part of Legion Remix. Blizzard, however, laid out its reasoning for excluding these rewards when Legion Remix was first announced, and is continuing to stick to its guns."Many times throughout the history of World of Warcraft, there have been items, titles, and other kinds of rewards that belong in a category of the most prestigious and historic accomplishments--rewards that we believe should be preserved in a historical context for only those players who earned them at the time," Kaivax wrote in a July forum post.WoW Legion Remix will launch as part of WoW's 11.2.5 patch on October 7. Like last year's Mists of Pandaria Remix event, those looking to participate won't need to purchase WoW's latest expansion but will need a subscription or game time in order to play.Legion Remix will speedrun through the expansion's original content by releasing its content patches in chunks every two weeks. Players will be able to earn all kinds of new and returning cosmetic rewards, as well as level up their Artifact to even greater levels than ever before. That extra power can then be put to the test with the event's new, Diablo-inspired Heroic World Tier and Timeworn Mythic+ Keystone dungeons.The 22 Best MMORPGs To Play In 2025See More
