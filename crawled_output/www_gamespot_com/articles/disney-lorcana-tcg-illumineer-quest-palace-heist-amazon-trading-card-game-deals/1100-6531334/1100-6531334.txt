Disney Lorcana's latest standalone card game is up for grabs for an incredibly low price at Amazon. For a limited time, you can save 50% on Illumineer's Quest: Palace Heist, dropping the price from $60 down to only $30. This is the lowest price yet for Palace Heist, which launched in June as part of the TCG's Reign of Jafar set. Palace Heist is a standalone game that can be played solo or cooperatively with another player. This makes it ideal for brand-new players and seasoned Lorcana enthusiasts looking for a change of pace. Palace Heist is only the second cooperative game in the Disney Lorcana TCG's two-year history.Palace Heist isn't the only Lorcana deal at Amazon right now. Collectors can save on various Booster Boxes, Illumineer's Trove bundles, budget-friendly Gift Sets, Starter Decks, and the Gateway Board Game. We rounded up Amazon's best Disney Lorcana TCG deals at the bottom of this story.

Disney Lorcana TCG: Illumineer’s Quest: Palace Heist
$30 (was $60)
Palace Heist comes with everything you need to play the new standalone game, including two player decks with 60 cards each, a scenario deck themed around the Aladdin villain, a playmat, and a bunch of other game pieces and tokens.Illumineer's Quest is designed to be a replayable experience and offers four different difficulty levels. Players place character and item cards from their deck on the game mat and square off against Jafar's 50-card deck. Your objective is to make it through the palace and secure the Reforged Crown. It's not a straightforward journey, however, as Supreme Sorcerer Jafar has plenty of tricks up his sleeve to impede your progress.Palace Heist is a compelling variant on Lorcana that is especially great for those who don't always have someone around to battle. It's also a good tool to introduce new players to the game, since it's fully playable as a single-player experience as well as cooperatively with one other player. You can also use the cards in the standard Lorcana TCG.Illumineer’s Quest: Palace Heist includes the following:1 Jafar Scenario Deck (50 cards)2 Player Decks (60 cards each)1 Oversized Jafar Card4 Battleground Cards1 Reforged Crown Tile1 Palace Heist Playmat1 Jafar Draw Token5 Lore Tracker Tokens29 Damage Counters1 Victory CardPalace Heist Rules SheetAs mentioned, this is the second Illumineer's Quest game. The first, Deep Trouble, released as part of the Ursula's Return set in May 2024. Illumineer's Quest: Deep Trouble still regularly sells for full price, though you can save a few bucks at Amazon. It's worth clarifying that Palace Heist and Deep Trouble are different games with unique scenarios and entirely separate decks of cards, so both games are worth checking out.

Best Disney Lorcana TCG Deals at AmazonAlong with the terrific deal on Palace Heist, Amazon has the Disney Lorcana TCG: Gateway Board Game for $19.88 (was $25). Gateway teaches new players how to play Lorcana's traditional competitive card game, and it's an especially great introduction for parents to play with kids. Several Lorcana Booster Boxes are up for grabs for $30-$40 off. Reign of Jafar's Booster Box is available for $115 (was $144); the best deal is the Azurite Sea Booster Box for $98. Each box comes with 24 booster packs with 12 cards in each, so you're getting 288 cards total.Though not marked as a deal, it's worth noting that Amazon recently relisted the Into the Inklands Bundle for $35. Originally released in early 2024, this budget-friendly bundle comes with two single-player decks, six booster packs, and a Glimmer Foil Mickey Mouse Pirate Captain promo card. The bundle originally sold for $45 and was thought to be out of print, so Amazon's restock lets collectors circle back to Lorcana's third set.
