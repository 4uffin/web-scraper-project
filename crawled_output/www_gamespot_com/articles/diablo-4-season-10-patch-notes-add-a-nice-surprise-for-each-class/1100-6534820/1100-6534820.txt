Diablo 4 Season 10 is looking to make its addition of Chaos Armor an even bigger deal, stealthily adding an additional Chaos Armor option for each class and making it so players have an even better way to earn guaranteed Chaos Armor drops.Official patch notes for Diablo 4 Season 10, Infernal Chaos, are out now, and while they are mostly the same as the ones from the season's public test realm build, there are a few noticeable changes coming alongside the Season 10 update on September 24 based on player feedback.Everything new coming in Diablo 4 Season 10.Chief among them are improvements to Chaos Armor, an even more powerful type of Unique item being introduced this season that gives players more build options by making it so that certain Unique effects can appear as items for additional armor slots than normal. Chaos Armor is also guaranteed to have at least one greater affix, making them on average stronger than a typical Unique.Each class had a number of Chaos Armor Uniques to choose from during the PTR, but Blizzard has sweetened the deal, adding an additional Unique that can roll as Chaos Armor for each class. They are:Barbarian - Ramaladni's Magnum OpusDruid - Dolmen StoneNecromancer - Mutilator PlateRogue - Scoundrel's KissSorcerer - Esu's HeirloomSpiritborn - Sunbird's GorgetCome the update, Chaos Armor will be visually distinct from normal Uniques, with a greenish hue, so players can better identify them. To earn a guaranteed piece of Chaos Armor, players will want to face down the new boss Bartuc as part of the game's revamped Infernal Hordes activity. Those who are able to bring down Bartuc on Torment IV difficulty will score even more Chaos Armor drops than before. In another change, Chaos Armor drops in the game's open world will no longer replace a Unique drop, and will instead be an additional reward.Blizzard additionally outlined how Season 10 will rework the game's frustrating boss-immunity phases. Bosses will instead gain a shield at 2/3 and 1/3 life that, if players are strong enough to deplete in five seconds, will prevent the boss from becoming immune. The shield's value at 2/3 life will be equal to 1/3 of the boss' max life, while the shield at 1/3 life will be equal to 2/3 of the boss' max life.The full Diablo 4 Season 10 patch notes, filled with various bug fixes and class-balance changes, can be found below. While Season 10 does bring some significant changes, some Diablo content creators have teased that even bigger changes are in the works, though Blizzard has not yet discussed what those might be. Diablo 4's next expansion is slated to arrive sometime in 2026.Diablo 4 Season 10 Full Patch NotesUpdates from PTRSeason of Infernal ChaosChaos RiftsReduced the damage of the Chaos Wave projectiles.Removed the stacking debuff system where getting hit by an attack from a Chaos Portal would increase the damage the player received.The Chaos Rift Nightmare Dungeon Affix now gives more rewards.Chaos ArmorChaos Armor is now visually distinct from normal unique items.Bartuc now has an increasing chance to drop Chaos Armor as players progress through Torment Tiers, granting more Chaos Armor at Torment IV than on the PTR.Chaos Armor world drops are now an additional reward instead of replacing a Unique.We’ve added New Chaos Armor to increase the heat for Season launch:

To preserve the novelty of Chaos Waves, and to ensure interesting and unique runs are possible, we've reduced the number of Chaos Waves that appear.Reduced the chance of Aether to spawn on kill while holding a Reliquary in the Reliquary Chaos Wave from 25% to 10%.Chaos Wave types now have different rarities. For example, Aether Goblins will be more rare.The player no longer drops the Reliquary if they are immune when Chaos Lightning impacts them during the Reliquary Chaos Wave.The Number of Chaos Waves per Infernal Horde run has been reduced from 3/4/5 to 1/1-2/2. These values are respectively for 6/8/10 wave Infernal Horde runs.Chaos Waves now spawn at more unpredictable waves than they did before.The description when choosing Chaos Waves now also mentions that additional Aether can be earned.Spirit Chaos Wave ghosts are now far more responsive to the player colliding with them.The Chaos Aetheric Mass may no longer be healed. Contrary to popular belief, it’s surprisingly ticklish.Chaos Rifts inside the Lunatic Siege Chaos Wave now drop additional Aether. This is to make sure the Chaos Wave has a better chance to gain Aether.The maximum amount of Aether gainable from a full health Aetheric Mass in the Lunatic Siege Chaos Wave was increased from 80 to 200.Closing Chaos Rifts in the Lunatic Siege Chaos Wave has a chance to spawn additional Chaos Rifts, gradually increasing the intensity of the mode.Base Aether AdjustmentsDeveloper’s Note: We found that too much Aether was being earned through lucrative Infernal Offering choices, which made the gap between a good run and a poor run unsatisfying. We've raised the base Aether granted by Aether Events to ensure a greater percentage of your Aether earned through a run is represented by your ability to simply blast monsters.Aether Mass increased from 1 to 3 base Aether.Aether Fiend increased from 2 to 4 base Aether.Soulspires increased from 1 to 5 base Aether.Aether Goblins reduced from 25 to 20 base Aether.Aetheric MassesThe Teeming, Hellish, and Anchored Mass Offerings now have a 50% chance to spawn their respective Aether Events, up from 30%.Puffing Masses has been reworked. Masses now drop 1 additional Aether for each Offering you have selected, doubled for Mass Offerings you've selected.Massing Masses reworked: Now has a 30% chance for the destroyed Aetheric Mass to reform.Hellborne spawned from the Hellish Masses Offering as a bonus from Aether Masses now scale with your additional Hellborne spawn Offerings.SoulspiresDeveloper’s Note: Soulspires have been a lacking category since Infernal Hordes has launched. We've taken a good look at Soulspire Offerings, and worked to make them far more lucrative options for a successful run. The team will continue to monitor feedback across Season 10 launch.The Rising Spires Offering can now appear a maximum of 2 times up from 1.Draining Spires Aether gain increased from 1 to 3.Precious, Treasured, and Coveted Spires multipliers changed to 2.5x, 2.25x, 2x from 3x, 4x, 5x.Developer’s Note: This change was made because the base Aether was increased.Precious, Treasured, and Coveted Spires rarity changed from Normal, Rare, Legendary to Rare, Legendary, Unique.Precious, Treasured, and Coveted Spires frequency reduced from a reduction to 75% of previous frequency from a reduction to 50% of previous frequency.Corrupting Spires renamed to Hungry Spires and reworked.
The Curse now pulls both players and enemies from outside to the inside of the area. Additionally, the chance for enemies to drop Aether was increased from 20% to 33%.Transitive Spires has been renamed to Rising Spires and reworked.
It now causes a Soulspire to spawn at the start of each wave and empowers enemies inside Soulspires.Fiends and LordsColossal Fiends now properly multiply the Aether gained from Aether Fiends that transform into Aether Lords.When both The Colossal Fiends and The Fiendish Legions Offerings are active at the same time, it will now correctly cause Aether Fiends that replace Elites to spawn instead as Aether Lords.Hellfire destruction from Aether Lord Offerings is now more subdued and will properly despawn when an Aether Lord is defeated.HellborneSummoned Hellborne is now a Legendary Infernal Offering from Common and Ambushing Hellborne is now a Common Infernal Offering from Legendary.Meteoric Hellborne rarity increased from Normal to Rare.Summoned Hellborne now only has a 20% chance to spawn additional Hellborne from an Aether Event down from 100%.MiscellaneousThe Burning Butcher in Infernal Hordes now has more health and deals more damage.Bartuc no longer becomes invulnerable.

Instead, he uses the new shield mechanics for Lair Bosses (see more details further down the patch notes in the Lair Bosses section).Bug FixesSeason of Infernal ChaosFixed an issue where the Mythic Chaos Rift did not always reward a Mythic item upon completion.Fixed multiple visual issues with Chaos Armor pieces.Fixed an issue where Masterworking Chaos Armor did not consume Forgotten Souls.Fixed an issue where Sharp Rock Splitter would not properly reset the cooldown of your Core Skills when using the Combined Strikes Chaos Perk.Fixed an issue where Rallying Cry and Challenging Shout received an incorrect amount of bonus from Deafening Chorus Chaos Perk.Fixed an issue where defeating Bartuc would drop items to grant Chaos Perks instead of directly unlocking them.Fixed an issue where Basic Skills with Unstable Power did not trigger Chaotic Cooldowns.Fixed various other issues where Chaos Armor and Chaos Perks did not function as intended in various contexts.GameplayInfernal HordesFixed an issue where Aether Goblins didn't always drop Aether.Fixed an issue where Party Members could use the Bartuc offering for free if they were outside of the Infernal Hordes when it was selected.Fixed an issue where players could join a party after Bartuc was already summoned and get rewards.Fixed an issue where the player could stand in a specific area to avoid damage from Bartuc during phase transition.Fixed an issue where Bartuc could be defeated before spawning.Fixed an issue where Bartuc's Fire Wave and Laser attacks could damage the player several times at once.Fixed an issue where the Fell Council could become invulnerable if too much damage was done at once in party play.Fixed an issue where Hellborne and Hellfire could remain after a wave ended.Fixed an issue where Aether rewards were inconsistent when clearing a Goblin Chaos Wave.Fixed an issue where the Area of Effect for the knockback from Aetheric Masses was much larger than intended.Fixed an issue where Chaos Bringers spawned in the initial wave could be missing substantial amounts of health.Fixed an issue where The Colossal Fiends affix didn't properly replace Aether Fiends with Aether Lords.Fixed an issue where the displayed health for Soulspires was not accurate when Transitive Spires was active.BarbarianFixed an issue where Ugly Bastard Helm would no longer convert damage to fire if a weapon swap occurs.Fixed an issue where the Rank 5 bonuses for Call of the Ancients and Wrath of the Berserker didn't benefit from Sabre of Tsagal.DruidFixed an issue where Grizzly Rage did not periodically increase the player's damage as expected.Fixed an issue where Ravens could scale infinitely when being auto cast.Fixed an issue where Airidah's Inexorable Will could deal Shadow damage instead of Physical damage.Fixed an issue where the puddles from Rotting Lightbringer didn't function properly in certain terrain, such as in Belial's boss area.Fixed an issue with Balanced Aspect not functioning while in Town.NecromancerFixed an issue where Lidless Wall did not properly increase Critical Strike Damage when you had multiple Bonestorms active.Fixed an issue where the Bone Prison from Indira's Memory did not trigger when using Blood Wave.Fixed an issue where Minions did not always respawn with the Necromancer.Fixed an issue where the Aspect of the Great Feast was not properly gaining ancestral ranks.Fixed an issue where Aphotic Aspect was not properly Stunning enemies and it disabled the bonus damage from Skeletal Priests.RogueFixed an issue where Shadow Clone was not gaining the damage bonus of Orphan Maker.Fixed an issue where Rain of Arrows could stop functioning.Fixed an issue where Shadow Imbuement from Assassin's Stride would occasionally not be applied to enemies who were very close to you.Fixed an issue where Rapid aspect would not function with Orphan Maker.SorcererFixed an issue where Ball Lightning would stop dealing damage when enough attack speed was gained.Fixed an issue where Familiars summoned by Sidhe Bindings would not gain their Enhancement.Fixed an issue where Serpentine Aspect was only consuming up to 500 Mana rather than all Mana.Developer’s Note: It is intended to give a damage bonus up to 500 Mana, but still consume all Mana, even if it is above 500. Using this Aspect along with the Mana Shield Chaos Perk should be very powerful, but great power comes with a bit of risk. The previous 4 second timer on the Mana Regeneration for Mana Shield was a bit too punishing to this playstyle, so we have reduced it to 2 seconds to help balance this risk and reward.Fixed an issue where Destructive Fireball would increase in damage the more it bounced.Fixed an issue where Inferno didn't always apply vulnerable when expected.SpiritbornFixed an issue where Harmonious Protector's damage bonus didn't properly apply when using Hesha E Kesungi.Fixed an issue where Harmonious Protector could apply barrier to enemies.Fixed an issue where The Protector didn't apply the intended amount of barrier.Fixed an issue where The Protector could reduce the player's damage.Fixed an issue where the Devourer was not gaining its Rank 5 bonus damage under any circumstances.Fixed an issue where Harmony of Ebewaka would not properly increase the damage of the Firestorm from Sunbird's Gorget.Fixed an issue where the secondary Eagle Spirit Hall's Vulnerable Damage bonus did not always increase when expected.Fixed an issue where the player could go outside the map when entering a Chaos Portal using The Hunter.MiscellaneousFixed an issue where some Ancestral Items could drop without Greater Aaffixes.Fixed an issue where the description for the Cadaverous Aspect was inconsistent between the Codex of Power and when the Aspect was present on an item.Fixed an issue where the visual effect for Barbarian's Wrath of the Berserker didn't appear.Fixed an issue where Shroud of False Death could grant more passive skill ranks than intended.Various performance, stability, UI, and visual improvements.Vessel of HatredGame UpdatesSpiritbornNew ItemsHesha e Kesungi: Unique GlovesAffixes
