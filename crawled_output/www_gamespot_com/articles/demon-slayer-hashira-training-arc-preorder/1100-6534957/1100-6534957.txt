$54.45 (was $70) | Releases December 9
Preorder at Amazon
Demon Slayer: Hashira Training Arc Limited Edition Box Set (Blu-ray)
$112 | Now available

Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle is currently slicing its way through the global box office, and while it'll be a long wait for the movie to make its way to Blu-ray, you can prep with the Demon Slayer: Hashira Training Arc season of the anime, which is coming to Blu-ray on December 9. For those who don't know, the Hashira Training Arc leads directly into the new Infinity Castle film, which kicks off the final Demon Slayer storyline. That makes this an important set of episodes to catch up on. Like previous Demon Slayer Blu-ray releases, the Hashira Training Arc is getting both standard and Limited Edition Blu-ray releases, and both are available to preorder now.
Demon Slayer: Hashira Training Arc Standard Edition (Blu-ray)
$54.45 (was $70) | Releases December 9
The standard edition Demon Slayer: Hashira Training Arc Blu-ray includes all eight episodes of the arc (with the option to watch with English or Japanese voice tracks) along with a small selection of special features across three discs. You can check out the list of extras below. Preorders are available now at Amazon, and are currently discounted to $54.45 (was $70).

Demon Slayer: Hashira Training Arc Limited Edition Box Set (Blu-ray)
$112 | Now available
The $112 Demon Slayer: Hashira training Arc Limited Edition Blu-ray Box Set comes with all eight episodes and the same bonus materials as the standard edition, plus a four-CD soundtrack and four accordion booklets. The entire set comes in a deluxe slipcase packaging with unique cover art illustrated by character designer Akira Matsushima. This Blu-ray box set is available now at Crunchyroll, which is nice if you don't want to wait for the standard edition Blu-ray's launch in December--though it's quite a bit more expensive.

Catch up on the Demon Slayer saga before Infinity Castle
To complete the set, you can also pick up the rest of the Demon Slayer series on Blu-ray. The show has been critically acclaimed since it first debuted several years ago, as this adaptation of Koyoharu Gotouge's manga doesn't just look amazing in action, it's also full of heart and charm. One thing to note here is that after the first season, a feature film of the Mugen Train arc was released. This story was also adapted into an episodic anime series, which stretches things out over several episodes. This story is essential viewing, but you can watch either animated adaptation of it before you jump straight into the Entertainment District arc and not have to worry about losing any valuable narrative context.Demon Slayer: Standard Blu-raysDemon Slayer Season 1: Part 1 -- $30Demon Slayer Season 1: Part 2 -- $48.74 ($65)Demon Slayer Season 2, Part 1: Mugen Train Arc -- $22.49 ($30)Demon Slayer: Mugen Train Movie -- $23.61 ($35)Demon Slayer Season 3: Swordsmith Village Arc -- $48.96 ($71)Demon Slayer Season 4: Hashira Training Arc -- $54.45 ($70) | Releases December 9Amazon still has stock of all the standard Blu-ray releases, but for the pricier limited editions, you'll want to check out the Crunchyroll store for these.

Demon Slayer manga volumes
$7 - $10 each
Currently, parts two and three of Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle don't have release dates, but they're rumored to be out in 2027 and 2029. That's a long wait, but at least you can find out how the story ends by reading the original manga paperbacks. You can grab each volume individually or you can get the enmtire collection as part of a box set deal. This giant collection has all 23 volumes, an exclusive booklet, and a double-sided poster inside a nice slipcase, and you can get it for $161 through an Amazon reseller.Alternatively, we've listed all the individual trades below, although this will work out to be more expensive as each paperback retails for $7-$10 on average. For the chapters specifically related to the Infinity Castle saga, we'd recommend volumes 16-18 for the first film, and then working your way through the rest of the library to see how things wrap up. The upcoming movies will feature several major battles with Muzan's Upper Rank demons, and don't expect anyone who takes part to walk away unscathed from this clash.Demon Slayer manga volumesDemon Slayer: Volume 1Demon Slayer: Volume 2Demon Slayer: Volume 3Demon Slayer: Volume 4Demon Slayer: Volume 5Demon Slayer: Volume 6Demon Slayer: Volume 7Demon Slayer: Volume 8Demon Slayer: Volume 9Demon Slayer: Volume 10Demon Slayer: Volume 11Demon Slayer: Volume 12Demon Slayer: Volume 13Demon Slayer: Volume 14Demon Slayer: Volume 15Demon Slayer: Volume 16Demon Slayer: Volume 17Demon Slayer: Volume 18Demon Slayer: Volume 19Demon Slayer: Volume 20Demon Slayer: Volume 21Demon Slayer: Volume 22Demon Slayer: Volume 23
