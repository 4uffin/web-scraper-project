Chucky has haunted screens and instilled the fear of dolls in the minds of many for decades. Thanks to the long-running film franchise and recent TV series, the creepy doll has become one of the most recognizable horror characters of all time. Soon, fans of the amateur comedian and full-time murderous doll can add two collectible editions from the Chucky franchise to their display shelves. Chucky: The Complete Series Steelbook Edition is up for preorder for $60 (was $65) at Amazon. The Steelbook Edition Blu-ray releases alongside standard edition Blu-ray and DVD collections this Tuesday, September 23.While you're picking up Chucky: The Complete Series, make sure to check out the Child's Play Limited Edition Steelbook. Exclusive to Amazon and slated to launch October 7, this collectible edition of the franchise's original 1988 film has already sold out multiple times since preorders opened, but it's back in stock as of September 21.
Chucky: The Complete Series Steelbook Edition (Blu-ray)
$60 (was $65) | Releases September 23
Chucky: The Complete Series includes all 24 episodes of Syfy's awesome TV series across six Blu-ray discs. Syfy canceled the show last fall, a few months after airing the third season. If you're a fan of the movies and haven't watched the show, we'd highly recommend it. The series is a sequel to the 2017 film Cult of Chucky. And while it leans more into the comedy, Chucky still commits plenty of gruesome murders. Plus, the show retains Brad Dourif as the voice of Chucky.The artwork on the steelbook's front cover looks cool, though it's not a brand-new design. The image of Chucky sitting against a school locker was first used to promote Season 1, but with "Wanna Play" written in blood instead of "The Complete Series." The back of the case features polaroid pictures with characters and references. When you open the steelbook, you're peering inside Chucky's locker. Along with more pictures, there's a bloody knife, because the Biology and Literature textbooks wronged him, apparently.Like many TV series with physical editions, Chucky has only ever been available on 1080p Blu-ray. The discs support Dolby Audio and DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1. The list of bonus features is a light, but you'll still find deleted scenes on all six discs along with a featurette called The Legacy of Chucky. In total, the series runs close to 19 hours.As mentioned, Chucky: The Complete Series also has a standard Blu-ray edition for $50 (was $55) and a DVD box set for $40 (was $45). It's also worth noting that all three seasons are available on Blu-ray. You'd spend roughly $55 total if you purchased each season individually instead.Chucky: Complete Series:Blu-ray Steelbook Edition -- $60 ($65)Blu-ray -- $50 ($55)DVD -- $40 ($45)Chucky: Seasons on Blu-ray:Season 1 -- $20 ($30)Season 2 -- $15 ($30)Season 3 -- $19.19 ($30)

Child's Play Limited Edition Steelbook (4K Blu-ray)
$45 | Releases October 7

Both Dolby Atmos and Dolby Vision are supported, as is DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1. You'll get a chilling steelbook featuring a close-up shot of Chucky, while a third disc (standard Blu-ray) is loaded with bonus features. Here's what's included:Behind-the-scenes special effects footageHoward Berger: Your Special Effects Friend 'Til The End - Interview with special makeup effects artistLife Behind the Mask: Being Chucky - Interview with Ed GaleEvil Comes in Small Packages - Interviews with Don Mancini, David Kirschner, Kevin Yagher, and moreChucky: Building a Nightmare - Featuring Kevin YagherA Monster Convention - Archival piece from The 2007 Monster Mania PanelIntroducing Chucky: The Making of Child's PlayVintage Child's Play featuretteTheatrical trailerTV spotBehind-the-scenes photo galleryPosters and lobby cards galleryAll of the on-disc content matches the original 4K Collector's Edition that released in 2022.
