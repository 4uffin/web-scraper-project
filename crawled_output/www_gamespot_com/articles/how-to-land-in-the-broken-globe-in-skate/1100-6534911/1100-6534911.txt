Stunt Challenges are one of the main goals you consistently have access to in Skate. They can be completed all across the map and offer terrific rewards for your character if you manage to finish all of the tasks included in the challenge. Of course, as you've likely already figured out, some of the Stunt Challenges in Skate feature extremely difficult tasks that seem impossible to complete at first glance.One of the most infamous Stunt Challenges in the early life cycle of Skate is called "Good Luck," and it has four separate tasks you need to complete. The last of these tasks requires you to "Land in the Broken Globe," which is arguably the toughest goal in the entire game. To see the best way to complete this task and the Good Luck challenge in Skate, take a look at the guide below.How to start the Good Luck challenge in SkateThe Good Luck Stunt Challenge can be started in the middle of the Hedgemont district in Skate. It's located between a few fast travel points and is indicated by a yellow diamond icon with a character wearing a skull helmet on it. Once you find it, you can head straight there or fast travel if you've unlocked one of the nearby points. At the challenge location, choose to begin the Stunt Challenge to start with your first task, which is to "Caveman onto the Rooftop."Like with all Stunt Challenges, you don't have to complete all of the goals in the order they appear on your mission list, as each task can be completed from the same location. However, we suggest leaving the broken globe task for last so you can finish the challenge on that task.Skate 2025 brings back the series' ample challenges, but none may be harder right now than the Broken Globe.You want to ensure you're setting Session Markers whenever you complete a goal and start a new one, as you usually won't complete the next task on your first try. This goes double for the last task in the Good Luck Stunt Challenge, which is to Land in the Broken Globe.How to Land in the Broken Globe in SkateWhen you manage to complete all three previous tasks in the Good Luck Stunt Challenge, you'll have to Land in the Broken Globe, which can really only be done from one spot on the map. This is the exact spot where you have completed the other tasks, so make sure you have a Session Marker on the rooftop that overlooks the curved rooftop (you can see mountains in the background).From this roof, get some speed and jump off to reach the curved rooftop. You'll want to get off your board and fly until just before you reach the rooftop. Then, get on your board, ride down and up the curved rooftop, and fly again.From here, you'll see the rooftop dumpster from earlier in the challenge, as well as the window in the roof where you had to go to land in the garage dumpster. However, you don't want to go near those locations to find the Broken Globe. Instead, you need to go left of those locations, towards the angled roof with all of the windows on it.What you want to do is angle yourself to the left of these broken windows, and then cut towards them at the last second. Your goal should be to have your character hit the wall halfway up the angled roof with the windows. With any luck, this will ragdoll your character straight down, which is where you'll find the Broken Globe.The exact spot you need to hit on the wall will change depending on how your character ragdolls when they hit it. Some players will get a nice bounce off the wall and land straight into the globe. However, other players might have to hit the wall higher or lower than halfway up if their character has a strange bounce. Either way, you should aim for halfway up the wall and try to angle your character sideways when they hit the concrete. This gives you the best chance to land in the globe right below you. We recommend watching the YouTube video here to get a better idea of how and where to hit the wall to land inside the broken globe.Skate Tips: 7 Things To Know Before You Drop In To EA's Skate RevivalSee More
