A Call of Duty movie is in the works now at Paramount, but it's still early days and there isn't much to go on at this stage. But now, Activision is seeking fan feedback about what they want a live-action Call of Duty movie to be "inspired by."A survey being sent to members of the community feedback program Recon Squad asks fans to rank what they want the film to be inspired by. The choices include Black Ops, Modern Warfare, Zombies, or something other than Black Ops or Modern Warfare. Alternatively, Activision wants to know if people would instead want a totally new Call of Duty story to serve as the inspiration for the movie.The survey was first reported on by Detonated.EXCLUSIVE | NEW #CallofDuty Recon Survey asks Players to RANK what they want the â€˜Live-Action Movieâ€™ to be INSPIRED BY, with these options:ðŸ’¥ Black Ops ðŸ’¥ Modern WarfareðŸ’¥ â€˜Call of Duty Zombies Storyâ€™ðŸ’¥ NOT BO or MW (Ghosts, AW, etc)ðŸ’¥ NEW Call of Duty Story pic.twitter.com/38hgahd2d9

Of course, Activision and Paramount aren't going to make the movie based on fan feedback alone, but the companies are clearly keen on gathering notes from fans.Paramount boss David Ellison said in the Call of Duty movie announcement that he's a big fan of the series, singling out the original World War II games, all the way through Black Ops and Modern Warfare."We're approaching this film with the same disciplined, uncompromising commitment to excellence that guided our work on Top Gun: Maverick, ensuring it meets the exceptionally high standards this franchise and its fans deserve. I can promise that we are resolute in our mission to deliver a cinematic experience that honors the legacy of this one-in-a-million brand--thrilling longtime fans of Call of Duty while captivating a whole new generation," Ellison said.Activision has been trying to make a Call of Duty movie for years. In 2015, the company established Activision Blizzard Studios and announced it would make an entire universe of Call of Duty movies. At the time, the team said it had plotted out "many years" of Call of Duty movies based on Call of Duty sub-brands like Modern Warfare and Black Ops, but none have ever come to be. Stefano Sollima (Sicario: Day of Soldado) was at one point attached to direct one of the Call of Duty movies, with Oscar-nominated writer Scott Silver signed on to write.Iconic Hollywood director Steven Spielberg reportedly wanted to make a Call of Duty movie, but he apparently had a series of demands that Activision wasn't willing to agree to.The next Call of Duty game, Black Ops 7, launches in November. A multiplayer beta for Black Ops 7 launches in early October.Black Ops 7 - Here Are 130 Screenshots For The Next Call Of DutySee More
