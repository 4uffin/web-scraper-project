Now Playing: Halloween The Game - Official Announcement Trailer
“Our goal is to push the horror experience to the next level with single and multiplayer modes so players can get the most out of the game,” said Jared Gerritzen, CCO of IllFonic. “Whether they become the boogeyman or fight to protect Michael Myers’ victims, Halloween promises an unforgettable battle of fear and survival.”Play as a Civilian and race to save your neighbors by guiding them to safety, scavenging weapons and supplies, and finding a phone to call the police before time runs out. Survival will come down to smart planning, teamwork, and split-second decisions. Players controlling Michael Myers will get to use powers like Shape Jump to move unseen and strike without warning.Illfonic was also the developer behind Friday the 13th: The Game, another asymmetrical survival-horror game that released in 2017. The game, while popular, had its multiplayer servers shut down in December of 2024. Illfonic is also well known for other horror adaptations like Predator: Hunting Grounds and Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed.PlayStation State Of Play September 2025: All The Biggest Announcements And GamesSee More
