The 8BitDo 64 Bluetooth Controller is on sale for the first time at Amazon. Released at the end of July, the reimagined N64 wireless controller is discounted to $30.57 (was $40). Only the white edition is available for this price; the black edition has been harder to find in stock, but Amazon restocked it today for full price.Though designed in partnership with retro hardware manufacturer Analogue, the 8BitDo 64 Bluetooth Controller also works wirelessly on Nintendo Switch, Switch 2, PC, and Android. To sync the controller to Switch 2, you'll likely need to download a firmware update. If you're a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscriber, the new controller offers a cool way to play classic N64 games.The 8BitDo 64 Bluetooth Controller was revealed alongside the Analogue 3D last October. Analogue's 4K Nintendo 64 has been delayed three times and is expected to launch Q4 2025.

The 8BitDo 64 Controller is a wireless Bluetooth gamepad that sports all the buttons you'd expect from a device designed to play N64 games but reorganized into a contemporary form factor that resembles the 8BitDo Ultimate Controller series.The reworked shape moves the joystick to the left side of controller. This is a Hall Effect joystick with a metal ring, so it should feel as smooth and precise as 8BitDo's other controllers with the same tech. Hall Effect sensors eliminate the risk of stick drift, and metal rings hold up better over time.8BitDo recreated the N64 control stick's surface by adding three circular ridges. Thankfully, it has a rubberized stick cap instead of the original's hard plastic surface. 8BitDo also included the octagonal stick gate, which Nintendo implemented on the N64 controller to mimic an eight-way D-pad. The actual D-pad on the new controller is in a new location, too, but it still sits in a recessed pocket.The large A/B buttons and four C buttons match the N64 layout and are the same size/shape. The should buttons and triggers have been redesigned to match modern expectations. The shoulder buttons are labeled R and L, just like the N64 controller, while both of the top triggers are Z buttons. The N64's Z button was on the back of the middle prong. The dual triggers will be helpful if you want to use the controller for games outside of the N64 library.The N64's big start button returns and is joined by three buttons found on many 8BitDo Switch controllers: minus (select), 8BitDo (home), and Turbo. Once you assign the turbo function to a button, pressing and holding it is registered as repeated taps.You can fully remap the controls and make other adjustments using the 8BitDo Ultimate Software desktop or mobile app. It has two different input modes: S-Input (Switch) and D-Input. Though it has built-in rumble motors, vibration is limited to Analogue 3D and Switch.

What is the Analogue 3D?The Analogue 3D is the premium retro hardware manufacturer's next FPGA console. Unfortunately, preorders for the $250 console sold out last October, so interested retro gamers will want to keep an eye on potential restocks after the console launches in Q4 2025.The console lets you play your original N64 game cartridges with hardware-accurate emulation and 100% compatibility in up to 4K resolution. The console has four controller ports for real Nintendo 64 three-prong controllers or third-party wired controllers. It does not come with a controller, though, so you'll want to grab an 8BitDo 64 Bluetooth Controller or another controller or two.Preowned N64 controllers are available to purchase at GameStop. Alternatively, you can buy one of the many clones of the original controller on Amazon for cheap.Sign up for GameSpot's Weekly Deals Newsletter: More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals & Preorders
