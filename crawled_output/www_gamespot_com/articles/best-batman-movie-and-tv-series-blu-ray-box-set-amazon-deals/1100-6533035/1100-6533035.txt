DC's annual celebration of Batman kicked off last week and runs through September 23. Amazon is observing Batman Day 2025 by offering superb deals on Batman movie and TV series box sets. Many of the limited-time deals are even better than the discounts Amazon offered during Prime Day 2025. Unsurprisingly, some deals have sold out, but you can still take advantage of a bunch of excellent offers, including Batman: The Complete Animated Series on Blu-ray for $29, The Batman on 4K for $13, and Batman Beyond: The Complete Series for $23 (was $55).A few deals are even better now than they were earlier this week. Most notably, Batman's 85th Anniversary 10-Film 4K Blu-ray Collection is on sale for only $80--it was $96.49 earlier in the week--and Batman's 80th Anniversary 18-Film Blu-ray Collection is $33 (was $70).We separated Amazon's Batman movie and TV deals into sections to make it easy to browse the lists below. If you want to see all of the deals in one place, we created an Amazon hub collecting all of the best Batman Blu-ray deals.
