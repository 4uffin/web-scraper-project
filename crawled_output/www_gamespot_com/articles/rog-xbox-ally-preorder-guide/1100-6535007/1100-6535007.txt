Asus has revealed the launch prices of the ROG Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X in the US. The ROG Xbox Ally is $600, while the more powerful Xbox Ally X clocks in at $1,000. The first Xbox-branded gaming handhelds launch October 16, and preorders are starting to go live at major retailers. The ROG Xbox Ally is up for preorder at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy. The Xbox Ally X is only listed at Best Buy and the Microsoft Store (for now). An official carrying case is up for preorder for $70 at Amazon.The $600/$1,000 price points are higher than some expected, though not all that surprising. After Best Buy quickly removed $550/$850 prices from the Xbox Ally store pages, it seemed likely that the prices of both devices would be at least a bit higher. As with many new tech products this year, Asus and Microsoft waited longer than usual to announce price points and preorder details. The ongoing tariff situation in the US has led to price increases for PlayStation, Nintendo, and Xbox hardware in 2025. Just last week, Microsoft announced price increases for the Xbox Series X|S in the US; the new prices take effect October 3.Check out the specifications of each ROG Xbox Ally handheld below.

Comparisons to the Xbox Series X|S are natural due to the branding, but it's worth emphasizing that these devices aren't really Xbox handhelds. The ROG Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X are Windows PCs running custom UI that will remind players of the Xbox. At the end of the day, though, the ROG Xbox Ally is playing Windows versions of games. As such, the prices are more aligned with other Windows handhelds like the regular Asus-branded ROG Ally handhelds, Lenovo Legion Go, and MSI Claw. But that also means you aren't restricted to the Xbox Store; you can launch Steam, GOG Galaxy, the Epic Games Store, and any other PC game client supported by Windows.ROG Xbox Ally AccessoriesAsus 2-in-1 Hard Case | Asus 100W Charger DockOfficial Accessories:ROG Xbox Ally 100W Charger Dock -- $100ROG Xbox Ally 2-in-1 Premium Case -- $70We also know the prices of two official ROG Xbox Ally accessories from Asus: A $70 hardshell carrying case with a built-in stand and accessories pouch, and a 100W Charger Dock.
