Diablo 4 Season 10 arrives September 23, and it will bring with it a major change to boss fights that players have long been asking for.Since Diablo 4's launch, players have complained about boss immunity phases, scripted moments in boss battles where endgame bosses become invincible and force players to contend with various mechanics before they can be harmed. While on paper it might make sense, it was resulting in a frustrating experience for many players who could easily kill the boss in just a few blows were it not for them becoming invincible for extended periods of time. Those phases became even more frustrating in Diablo 4 Season 8, which overhauled its endgame boss ladder to put even more of an emphasis on boss fights that heavily featured the mechanic.Boss immunity phases are finally gone in Diablo 4 Season 10. As detailed in a recent Diablo 4 developer update, endgame lair bosses will instead gain a shield that, while potent, can still be blasted through by players with sufficiently strong characters."If you're powerful enough, you can still nuke the boss and continue on your way, but it still provides a meaningful and significant challenge for less powerful characters," lead seasons designer Ben Fletcher said.A look at the new content and changes coming in Diablo 4 Season 10.A new boss, Bartuc, that can be battled as part of the season's overhaul of its endgame Infernal Hordes activity has also been updated to use the same shield mechanic following testing on the Diablo 4 public test realm, Fletcher said.Diablo 4 Season 10, Infernal Chaos, will not only bring major changes to Infernal Hordes, but additionally introduce an even more powerful type of Unique item called Chaos Armor. Meanwhile, Blizzard continues to tease major changes are in the works for Diablo 4, even though its next expansion isn't coming until 2026.Games Like Diablo To Loot Your Way Through In 2025See More
