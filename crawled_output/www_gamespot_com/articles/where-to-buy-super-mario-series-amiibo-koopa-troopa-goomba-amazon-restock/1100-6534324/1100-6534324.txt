Amazon has restocked a pair of Nintendo Amiibo figures that it hasn't had in its inventory in more than seven years. Super Mario fans can add Koopa Troopa and Goomba Amiibo to their collections for $16 each. Both characters are shipped and sold by Amazon, so we wouldn't expect Mario's iconic punching bags to remain in stock for very long. Goomba and Koopa Troopa are part of the long-dormant Super Mario Amiibo series.Both figures released in the US in October 2017 and were sold out at Amazon by time the calendar flipped to 2018. The regular price of Nintendo Switch Amiibo recently increased to $20, so you're technically saving 20% on Koopa Troopa and Goomba. The same could be said about Sora from Kingdom Hearts, which launched in early 2024 and is in stock for $16.Nintendo Switch Amiibo at AmazonSuper Mario Amiibo series - Koopa Troopa and GoombaSplatoon fans can get the Pearl & Marina 2-Pack for $25, but you'll need to move fast; the combo pack is $10 below MSRP and almost out of stock. Randomly, the European edition of Robin from Fire Emblem is also in stock, though for the peculiar price of $20.90.Koopa Troopa (Super Mario) -- $16Goomba (Super Mario) -- $16Sora (Kingdom Hearts) -- $16Pearl & Marina 2-Pack (Splatoon) -- $25Robin (Fire Emblem) -- $20.90Switch 2 Amiibo deals at AmazonYou can find many other Switch Amiibo figures on Amazon, but the five listed above are the only characters sold/shipped by Amazon at this time. Check out the Koopa Troopa and Goomba Amiibo below. Nintendo Switch 2 owners should also take a look at the deals on the new Zelda and Street Fighter Amiibo before they're gone.
Goomba: Super Mario Amiibo Series
$16 | MSRP is $20
The Goomba Amiibo launched October 6, 2017, the same day as Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga + Bowser's Minions for Nintendo 3DS. Other Super Mario role-playing games have supported Amiibo figures, but Goomba and Koopa Troopa are the only characters to release with a Mario RPG.In Bowser's Minions, the figure unlocks Gold Goomba as well as several stamp sheets. Several other Nintendo 3DS games can read the Goomba Amiibo. Most notably, if you scan the figure while playing WarioWare Gold, Wario will draw a hilariously terrible Goomba picture.Goomba also has unique functionality in a handful of Nintendo Switch games, including Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury, Super Mario Party, and Bayonetta 2. In Super Mario Party, you'll get an exclusive shiny Goomba sticker.

Koopa Troopa: Super Mario Amiibo Series
$16 | MSRP is $20
Koopa Troopa joined the Super Mario Amiibo series the same day as Goomba, so this figure has similar read/write functionality with Superstar Saga + Bowser's Minions. Players can unlock Gold Koopa Troopa and themed stamp sheets for Bowser's Minions and the mainline story mode. Koopa Troopa is compatible with several other Mario games for 3DS. And yes, in case you were wondering, Wario is bad at drawing Koopa Troopa, too.On Switch, Koopa Troopa functions similarly to Goomba in Smash Bros. Ultimate, Bowser's Fury, Bayonetta 2, and Super Mario Party. You'll unlock the Koopa Troopa Spirit in Smash Bros., but since a shiny Koopa sticker doesn't exist in Super Mario Party, it unlocks the Goomba sticker (if you don't already have it).Koopa Troopa also unlocks exclusive costumes in two additional games: Conga Master Party and Yoshi's Crafted World.

Goombas and Koopa Troopas have been franchise fixtures since the original Super Mario Bros. debuted in 1985 on the Nintendo Entertainment System.In World 1-1, the first few obstacles Mario encounters are the ever-grumpy mushrooms with feet. After flattening a handful of Goombas by jumping on their heads, Mario meets the perpetually smiling tortoise for the first time. There's only one Koopa in World 1-1, but that's enough to introduce players to the more efficient method for eliminating Goombas. Over the past 40 years, Super Mario fans have hurled countless Koopa Shells at groups of Goombas.Nintendo has iterated on Bowser's original henchmen on many occasions, but you can still count on seeing regular Koopas and Goombas in the vast majority of Super Mario Bros platformers and spin-offs. When you encounter one, there's a good chance the other is nearby, so it's only fitting that Amazon has both of these Amiibo in stock at the same time.
