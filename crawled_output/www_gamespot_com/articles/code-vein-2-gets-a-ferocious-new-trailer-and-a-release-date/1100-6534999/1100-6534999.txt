A new trailer for Bandai-Namco's Code Vein II debuted on the September 24th PlayStation State of Play broadcast. A release date of January 30, 2026 has also been revealed. Code Vein II is the sequel to 2019's cult-classic vampire-themed action/RPG Code Vein. The game takes place in a dark fantasy world where humans coexist among undead, vampiric beings known as Revenants. A mysterious, malevolent force, the Luna Rapacis, is transforming Revenants into rampaging monstrosities. Your custom-created protagonist character teams up with a time-bending young woman named Lou to discover the origin of the Luna Rapacis and stop the world's decay.Time-travel and exploration will be important elements of gameplay, as will the series' unique "blood action" combat skills. You'll be able to customize many aspects of your player character, from appearance to skills and weaponry--including two new weapons, Rune Blades and Dual Swords. Also new are the "Forma" skills that generate a variety of powerful effects: thus far, we've seen the Motorcycle Forma and the Absolute Execution Sword, debuting in this trailer.PlayStation State Of Play September 2025: All The Biggest Announcements And GamesSee More
