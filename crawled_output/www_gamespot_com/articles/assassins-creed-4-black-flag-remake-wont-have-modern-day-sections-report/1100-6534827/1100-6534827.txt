It sounds like those present-day, first-person non-Animus sections in Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag will be scrapped in the long-rumored remake--if a new report from a French outlet is to be believed.According to Jeuxvideo, as spotted by IGN, the modern-day sections in Black Flag--you know, the ones where you get out of your pod-like Animus to roam the Abstergo Entertainment offices to make sense of protagonist Edward Kenway's connection to the game's overarching narrative--have been gutted from the remake rumored to drop sometime in 2026.

These sections were pivotal to Black Flag's story structure. Following the events of Assassin's Creed III, Abstergo found new ways to tap into a host's genetic memories and wanted to use you--the unnamed character during these modern-day segments--as a means of gaining intel on Kenway, the late Desmond Miles, and the power the two were after. You and a host of resistors thwart Abstergo's plans for ultimate power by, well, getting out of and hacking multiple Animuses (Animi?) while also shooting and swashbuckling as the pirate-turned-assassin Kenway.To make up for the reportedly cut content, however, Jeuxvideo claimed developer Ubisoft is adding more stuff to the Black Flag remake, including an additional story for the English pirate and fellow assassin Mary Read. Apparently, this is content that never made it into the base game, but it's unclear if this additional story stuff will fill out the game's roughly 24-hour runtime.Alongside the apparent removal of modern-day sections, there are other supposed changes and improvements coming to the unannounced remake. This includes overhauled combat and gear to bring this 2013 open-world pirate adventure closer to more modern Assassin's Creed games like Valhalla and Shadows.In other, more substantiated news, Ubisoft just dropped Assassin's Creed Shadows' Claws of Awaji expansion. The new DLC--which is free for folks who preordered the game and was created by Mirage developer Ubisoft Bordeaux--adds new gear, weapons, and 10 hours of story content. With the expansion now available, Ubisoft also dropped a new update that introduces more upgrade tiers and a higher level cap.Assassin's Creed Shadows is available on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.Best Assassin's Creed Shadows Skills For YasukeSee More
