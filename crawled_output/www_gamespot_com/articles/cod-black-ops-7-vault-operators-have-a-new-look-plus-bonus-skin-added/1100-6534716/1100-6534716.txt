Now Playing: Call of Duty Black Ops 7: First Impressions
The T.E.D.D. operator now looks less human and more like the robot originally featured in Black Ops 2's Zombies mode. The flesh has melted off his face to show more of his robotic features. The bonus T.E.D.D. skin added to the Vault Edition bundle will look more like the original Black Ops 7 design that was announced, but Activision says it does have some minor changes.Redesigned Vault operatorsFor Karma, her holographic plates and visor have been adjusted. This redesign shows more of her face than the original version. Harper's operator skin also has slight adjustments with armor now recolored and looking more streamlined. The only operator who didn't receive a change is Reaper EWR-3.The operators' new looks can be seen in the image above. A more detailed 360-degree-look at the skins can be seen in the videos shared on Call of Duty's blog.Activision says these changes were made as part of Call of Duty's commitment to the "authentic look and feel of Black Ops 7," and after receiving community feedback specifically related to the Black Ops 7 Vault Edition operators.The publisher recently made changes to Call of Duty's Carry Forward program, allowing only specific skins and items to transfer from Black Ops 6 to Black Ops 7. This will include some of the Zombies-themed skins players earned by completing the main story quests, but wacky skins like Ninja Turtles and Beavis and Butt-Head won't carry over.Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 launches on November 14 for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC. More details and gameplay will be revealed during Activision's Call of Duty: Next event on September 30. You can find highlights of all major Black Ops 7 announcements here, which includes details on the campaign, a massive round-based Zombies map, and a futuristic multiplayer.
