Activision has confirmed that you can indeed pet the dog in Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, but it's not exactly what you think. Black Ops 7 is a futuristic game set in 2035, and it features the Deployable Armored Weaponized Groundcraft, or D.A.W.G. In a newly released video, the developers from Treyarch said a small team put in the work to add the ability to pet the killer robot machine. "This is a fun one. It started as a small, little Easter egg and, inevitably, somebody asked the question, 'Can I pet that dog?' And a very small group of people made it happen," design director Matt Scronce said.You can see the character petting the D.A.W.G. in the video below, but Scronce said Treyarch is not going to reveal exactly how players achieve petting the D.A.W.G. You'll have to figure that out for yourself, he said.In our latest Dev Talk, we break down every little detail in the #BlackOps7 MP Reveal Trailer.Here's what you might have missedâ€¦ ðŸ‘€ pic.twitter.com/1Hec6cCGdd
