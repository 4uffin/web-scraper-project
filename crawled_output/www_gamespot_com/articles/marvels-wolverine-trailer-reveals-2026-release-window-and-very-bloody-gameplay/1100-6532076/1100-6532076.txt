Today, during the PlayStation State of Play livestream, Insomniac Games provided a new look at Marvel's Wolverine, the studio's next Marvel superhero adventure. It also revealed that Spartacus actor Liam McIntyre will voice Wolverine in the game. The trailer pits Wolverine against a few familiar faces, including Omega Red and a giant sentinel. Mystique also put in an appearance, but not necessarily as a friend or foe. Most of Wolverine's enemies appear to be from the Reavers, a group of cyborgs who hate mutants. Insomniac also confirmed that the story will take Wolverine all over the world, from the Canadian wilderness to the streets of Tokyo, as well as to Logan's old stomping grounds in Madripoor.Marvel's Wolverine was first revealed during the PlayStation Showcase in September 2021, while this new trailer is the first official update for the game since that initial reveal. Insomniac Games suffered a massive data breach in December 2023, and the data released from the breach included some raw footage of a pre-alpha Wolverine build.Insomniac will show off more information about Wolverine next spring, and the game will hit PlayStation 5 in fall 2026.PlayStation State Of Play September 2025: All The Biggest Announcements And GamesSee More
