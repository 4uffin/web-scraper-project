While previous Borderlands games had a single Golden Chest that could be unlocked with Golden Keys, Borderlands 4 has four of them scattered around the primary safehouses of Kairos--Belton's Bore, The Launchpad, Carcadia, and The Lockaway. You'll find your first one early in the game, and the rest you'll unlock as you continue the campaign.What are Shift codes?A reward system comprised of 25-character codes, Shift codes have been around since the days of Borderlands 2. Typically, these reward players with Golden Keys that can then be used in a special treasure chest, but they can also unlock cosmetics to be used in a Borderlands game. Codes also have an expiry date, usually ranging between 48 hours and a week, and they're found online through affiliated social media channels.How to redeem Shift codesTo redeem your Shift code, you'll first need to create a Shift account on the Gearbox website. This is quick and easy to do, and you can then activate your Shift codes on the same website or via the in-game Social menu or via Borderland 4's Social menu at launch. The other thing to note about Shift codes is that they typically have expiration dates, so it's a good idea to redeem one as soon as possible.From there, you can bank the rewards if they turn out to be Golden Keys, or splurge and use all of them to grab some new gear in one go.One important note: The rewards contained within these chests scale to your current level, so you may want to consider waiting to use a Golden Key. Otherwise, using one early in the game will net you low-level gun as opposed to one you can use long-term.For more on Borderlands 4, you can see how Gearbox plans to keep you looting and shooting after launch, how to get a free Borderlands 4 gun skin, and this deep dive into every Vault Hunter in the game.Borderlands 4 Classes Tier List - Which Class Is Best?See More
