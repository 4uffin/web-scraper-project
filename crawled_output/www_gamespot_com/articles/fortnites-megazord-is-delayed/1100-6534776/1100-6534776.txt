Tuesday was supposed to mark the arrival of the Power Rangers Megazord in Fortnite, both in the form of a battle pass skin and as an in-game event in which one player in each round of Battle Royale gets to become the full-sized Megazord and terrorize the island for a few minutes. The patch was delayed, but you'll be forgiven for not knowing that since Epic hasn't yet added any in-game notification about the delay. So the Megazord page of the battle pass just looks bugged right now.The Megazord's arrival on the Fortnite island has been pushed back a couple days.Epic has not acknowledged the delay, nor has it said when the patch will now be deployed, but a leaked trailer for the Megazord in-game event says it begins on Thursday, September 18, so that's our best guess for now. As has been the case the past few seasons, battle pass owners will be able to unlock the Megazord skin and all its related cosmetics by gaining 24 levels in any Fortnite mode. Despite the Megazord page of the pass already being unlocked, you cannot gain these levels early since the quests haven't yet been activated.We don't know why it was delayed, but the patch appears to be a pretty beefy one, as it's expected to include the new Party Crashers battle royale mode, which will have proximity voice chat and support teaming with opponents, Hunger Games-style.Beyond that, this week marks the start of a new season of Rocket League, and so this Fortnite patch should add the Pontiac Firebird and Chevy Astro van from Rocket Pass 20, as well as a pile of other new vehicle cosmetics.Fortnite Festival Gorillaz Pass: Skins And RewardsSee More
