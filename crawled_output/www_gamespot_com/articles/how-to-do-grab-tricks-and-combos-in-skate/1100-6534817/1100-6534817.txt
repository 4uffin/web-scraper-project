During the tutorial phase in Skate, you'll learn how to perform simple flip tricks and grinds. While these mechanics are integral to the core gameplay in Skate, they're not the flashiest tricks you can do in San Vansterdam. Grab tricks have always been the bread and butter of any skateboarding game, as they look incredible in the air and showcase your skills with a board. Grab tricks also allow you to rack up huge points with your multiplier in Skate, which is something you'll need as you progress to harder challenges.However, once you've locked in the best Skate settings and the tutorial phase is over in Skate, you'll mostly be left in the dark when it comes to grab tricks. Fortunately, we have a simple way for you to learn how to perform these flashy tricks.How to perform grab tricks in SkateThere are dozens of different grab tricks you can do in Skate, and while it might take you a long time to memorize each one, you have a useful tool to help you along the way. This tool is the Skatepedia, otherwise known as the full Skate trick list, which every player has access to after completing the tutorial.You can access the Skatepedia by going to the main menu and selecting it after clicking the cog icon at the top-right of the screen. Inside the Skatepedia, you'll find sections on how to perform every style of trick in Skate. This includes flip tricks, grinds, off-board mechanics, and, most importantly, grab tricks.The Skatepedia section on grab tricksIf you hover over any one of the tricks in the "Grabs" section of the Skatepedia, you can read exactly what the trick entails and what buttons you need to press to perform the trick. Generally, a grab trick involves holding LT/L2 and RT/R2 while in mid-air. Variations of grab tricks can be performed by pressing a certain direction on your right stick as well. Some of the more advanced tricks will also have you moving the right to a specific direction before going into mid-air and using LT/L2 and RT/R2.The grab tricks in Skate are classified into several different sections: Basic Grab Tricks, Modified Grab Tricks, One-Foot Grab Tricks, No-Foot Grab Tricks, Ground Grab Tricks, Hand Plants, and Foot Plant Tricks. The Skatepedia also specifies that more grab tricks are "coming soon," so look for this list to grow during early access.We recommend starting with the Basic Grab Tricks if you want to begin with the mechanics in Skate. Then, once you master the 10 tricks in that section, you can move on to the other, more advanced tricks. Here's a list of how to do those Basic Grab Tricks:BS Grab: Hold RT/R2FS Grab: Hold LT/L2Double Grab: Hold LT/L2 + RT/R2Tail Grab: Hold Up on RS + LT/L2Nose Grab: Hold Down on RS + RT/R2Stale Grab: Hold Right on RS + LT/L2Weddle Grab: Hold Right on RS + RT/R2Crail Grab: Hold Down on RS + LT/L2Seatbelt: Hold Up on RS + RT/R2Rocket Air: Hold Down on RS + RT/R2 and LT/L2Grab tricks definitely take more practice than flip tricks or grinds in Skate, but the effort is more than worth the result. Learning how to do grab tricks is your ticket to higher scores and more XP in Skate, so find a ramp you like, place your session marker, and start practicing your grabs.Skate Tips: 7 Things To Know Before You Drop In To EA's Skate RevivalSee More
