Last week's hour-long Nintendo Direct was filled with exciting announcements, including brand-new reveals like Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2 and long-awaited release date confirmations such as Metroid Prime 4: Beyond. We now know that Nintendo has six big game launches in a two-month span starting with the Mario Galaxy collection on October 2 and ending with Metroid Prime 4 December 4. Between those holiday season bookends, Nintendo will release Pokemon Legends: Z-A, Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment, and Kirby Air Riders. And that's not even counting the wide assortment of third-party games, including Hades II, a timed exclusive published by Nintendo.Nintendo Direct Preorders:Preorder new Nintendo Games at AmazonPreorder new Nintendo Amiibo at AmazonNintendo also revealed seven new Amiibo figures: three for Metroid Prime 4, two for Kirby Air Riders, and two for Super Mario Galaxy. Metroid and Mario also have upcoming books releasing this fall: Metroid Prime 1-3: A Visual Retrospective and Rosalina's Storybook.We've rounded up all of the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 (and original Switch) games and accessories from the Nintendo Direct that you can preorder now at Amazon.

Nintendo Switch 2 Games at Amazon Upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 and Switch exclusives All Switch 2 Games at AmazonSee Nintendo Exclusives at AmazonSee upcoming games at Amazon Mario Kart World's $80 price led many Nintendo fans to believe this would be a common price point for Switch 2 exclusives. It turns out that's not the case--at least not yet. Metroid Prime 4, Hyrule Warriors, Kirby Air Riders, and all of the other Switch 2 games in Nintendo's popular franchises are $70. Original Switch editions of Pokemon Legends: Z-A and Metroid Prime 4: Beyond are $60. The outlier here is Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2. The lone physical edition is an original Switch game that's priced at $70. The collection has a free upgrade pack for Switch 2.Note: A couple of the games in the list below aren't exclusive to Switch 1/2--Dragon Quest VII Reimagined and Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade--but they were part of the September Nintendo Direct. Hades II is a timed console exclusive published by Nintendo, but it will also be available on PC at launch.Nintendo Direct (September 2025) - Switch 1/2 Game PreordersSuper Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2 -- $70 | Oct. 2Pokemon Legends: Z-A -- $60-$70 | Oct. 16Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment -- $70 | Nov. 6Kirby Air Riders -- $70 | Nov. 20Hades II -- $50 | Nov. 20Metroid Prime 4: Beyond -- $60-$70 | Dec. 4Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade -- $40 | Jan. 22, 2026Dragon Quest VII Reimagined -- $60 | Feb. 5, 2026Mario Tennis Fever -- $70 | Feb. 12, 2026Nintendo Switch 2 Exclusives Available NowBravely Default: Flying Fairy HD Remaster -- $40Donkey Kong Bananza -- $69 ($70)Kirby and the Forgotten Land + Star-Crossed World -- $79 ($80)The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild -- $69 ($70)The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom -- $79 ($80)Mario Kart World -- $79 ($80)Super Mario Party Jamboree + Jamboree TV -- $79 ($80)Yakuza 0 Director's Cut -- $40 ($50)Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S -- $30 ($40)Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma -- $49-$60 ($60-$70)

Metroid Prime 4's trio of Amiibo figures have two release dates and price points. The large Samus & Vi-O-La motorcycle figure is $40 and launches alongside the new $30 Samus Aran Amiibo on November 6. An Amiibo version of Sylux hits store shelves the same day as Metroid Prime 4: Beyond. The two Kirby Air Riders Amiibo are $50 each, which makes them the priciest Amiibo figures yet. It's not very surprising, though, as the Warp Star and and Winged Star Machines shown above are separate figures, so these are more like double packs. Super Mario Galaxy fans will have to wait until April 2026 to add the new Mario and Rosalina Amiibo figures to their collections. Each figure is $40, though the character stands are more elaborate than we typically see with Amiibo.Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Amiibo PreordersSamus & Vi-O-La -- $40 | Nov. 6Samus -- $30 | Nov. 6Sylux -- $30 | Dec. 4Kirby Air Riders Amiibo PreordersKirby & Warp Star -- $50 | Nov. 20Banana Waddle Dee & Winged Star -- $50 | Nov. 20Super Mario Galaxy Amiibo PreordersMario and Luma -- $40 | Apr. 2, 2026Rosalina and Lumas -- $40 | Apr. 2, 2026The seven new Amiibo join an existing lineup of eight Zelda, Street Fighter, and Donkey Kong Switch 2 Amiibo figures.

Not all of the official Switch 2 accessories were impacted, but the Pro Controller and Joy-Con 2 each increased by five bucks. The list below also includes a couple of the most popular officially licensed third-party accessories like Samsung's 256GB microSD Express Card and Hori's Piranha Plant Camera, which looks cool but isn't a good piece of tech.Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller -- $89Joy-Con 2 Controller 2-Pack -- $99Joy-Con 2 Charging Grip -- $40Joy-Con 2 Racing Wheels (2-Pack) -- $25Joy-Con 2 (Right, Red Strap) -- $54Joy-Con 2 (Left, Blue Strap) -- $54Joy-Con 2 Straps (2-Pack) -- $15Samsung 256GB microSD Express Card -- $59AC Adapter -- $35Nintendo Switch 2 Camera -- $54Hori Piranha Plant Camera -- $40 ($60)Carrying Case & Screen Protector -- $40 | Sold outAll-In-One Carrying Case -- $85 | Sold outThe official Nintendo Switch 2 carrying cases have been sold out for months. We'd recommend the officially licensed RDS Game Traveler Deluxe series of Switch 2 cases. The $20 Game Traveler Deluxe is comparable to the $40 Nintendo case, and the $40 Game Traveler System Case is comparable to the All-In-One edition.
