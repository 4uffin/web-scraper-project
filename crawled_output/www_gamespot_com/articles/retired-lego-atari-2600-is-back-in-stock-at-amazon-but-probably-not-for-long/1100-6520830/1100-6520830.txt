Lego Atari 2600 (2,532 Pieces)
$240 | Discontinued in December 2024
See at Amazon
After selling out earlier this year, Amazon has restocked the discontinued Atari 2600 Lego set. We doubt that these Lego sets were unearthed from a mass Atari burial site in New Mexico, because unlike the E.T. video game, the Atari 2600 Lego set is awesome, but it is interesting that Amazon has units available. It's also a nice that Amazon is charging the original $240 MSRP for this 2,532-piece set. Lego retired the Atari 2600 last December, and most retailers have been sold out all year. Earlier this year, Amazon restocked the retired Lego Nintendo Entertainment System, but the retailer charged $60 above MSRP--sadly, that $330 price sounds like a deal compared to reseller prices these days. The looming launch of the Lego Game Boy caused the NES to sell out, so we wouldn't be surprised if the Atari 2600 building set disappears soon (again).

The Atari 2600 is part of the Lego Icons series of display builds for adults and experienced builders. Lego based the model after the original and most popular edition of the classic console, so it has faux wood paneling on the front.The completed console build is 13 x 8.5 inches. At its tallest point, the console is 3 inches from the ground. The four switches--two on each side--are functional and mimic the original settings: Power, TV Type, Game Select, Game Reset. You'll also build small gamer room complete with a minifigure playing Asteroids on a CRT TV. The diorama also includes other era-appropriate details like a landline phone, boom box, and vintage posters. The vignette, shown atop the console in the image above, flips up when you push the front panel.

Lego Atari 2600 also comes with a handful of smaller builds. In addition to the console itself, you'll build a replica of the CX40 Joystick with a cable that plugs into the back of the system. You'll also piece together three Atari 2600 game cartridges: Adventure, Centipede, and Asteroids as well as miniature dioramas themed around each game. For an Atari that actually plays real games, check out the upcoming Pac-Man-themed Atari 2600+. The retro console is releasing alongside four classic Namco games as well as a series of Ghost Gang CX40+ Wireless Joysticks.

Lego Video Game Hardware Building Models As mentioned, Lego next's gaming hardware replica is the original Game Boy. Set to release October 1 for $60, the Lego Game Boy is a 421-piece model with two cartridges and a authentic design. If you haven't preordered the Lego Game Boy yet, you can still grab one at the Lego Store, but all major retailers are sold out at the time of writing. You should also check out the Lego Arcade Machine, a 468-piece buildable arcade cabinet that opens to reveal an '80s-themed game room. The Lego Arcade Machine released August 1. The other licensed, large-scale build that's still available today is the Lego Icons: Pac-Man Arcade. The 2,651-piece set is in stock at Amazon for $270.

Though it's not gaming hardware, it's worth pointing out that Amazon and Walmart are offering a big discount on the Lego Super Mario World: Mario & Yoshi Lego set. The 1,215-piece build creates a large pixel art model of Mario and Yoshi based on the 16-bit SNES classic. Normally $130, Lego Super Mario World: Mario & Yoshi is discounted to $104 for a limited time.
