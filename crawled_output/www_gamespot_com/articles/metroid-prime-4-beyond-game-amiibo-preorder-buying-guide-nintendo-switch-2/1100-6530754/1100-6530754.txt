Retailers typically add the bonus to your order if you preorder before it was announced.

Metroid Prime 4: Beyond was initially revealed back at E3 2017, just a few months after the Nintendo Switch launched. Preorders actually opened at the same time. Many fans had an Amazon preorder for nearly eight years before the retailer finally canceled all existing orders earlier this year. Prime 4 was originally being developed by Bandai Namco, but the project was scrapped and restarted in 2019 by Retro Studios. The Nintendo subsidiary developed the previous three Prime games, and Beyond is led by the original producer Kensuke Tanabe. Gameplay footage shown so far has looked very promising.Metroid Prime 4: Beyond takes place after the events of Metroid Prime 3: Corruption, though how far after remains unclear. What we do know is that it will see Samus explore an all-new planet, Viewros, populated by a new musical alien race called____ who have called on Samus to save the planet from an unknown threa. To aid in her adventure, the ____ imbue Samus with all-new psychic powers that will allow her to interface with the strange ruins and artifacts on Viewros and defend herself against the deadly creatures that live there.As confirmed in an earlier gameplay trailer, Samus' enigmatic rival, Sylux, will also appear and likely play a pivotable role in the storyline. Gameplay footage shown so far has looked very promising, and fans don't have to wait much longer to explore the planet of Viewros through Samus' iconic visor.
Metroid Prime Remastered for Nintendo Switch
$40

If you're looking to play earlier Metroid Prime games before the Beyond arrives, unfortunately, the long-rumored Metroid Prime Trilogy for Switch never materialized. But you can at least play the gorgeous 2023 remaster of the original GameCube hit. Metroid Prime Remastered is a brilliant modernization of the 2002 classic. You can snag the physical edition for Nintendo Switch for $40 at Amazon. Samus' 2021 side-scrolling adventure Metroid Dread is also well-worth playing.Metroid Prime Remastered (Switch) -- $39Metroid Dread (Switch) -- $55 ($60)Metroid Dread (Import) -- $47 ($60)Metroid Dread Amiibo 2-Pack -- $29Metroid: Samus Returns (3DS) -- $47In August, PowerA launched a pair of Metroid Prime-themed accessories. After initially selling out, the new PowerA Enhanced Wireless Controller and wired gaming earbuds are back in stock at Amazon. Take a look at both of the stylish pieces of gear below.
PowerA Metroid Prime Enhanced Wireless Controller
$70
PowerA's new Metroid-themed wireless controller is compatible with Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 via Bluetooth. The controller is officially licensed and has a traditional form factor similar to Nintendo's Pro Controllers.It has anti-friction joystick rings, motion controls, dual rumble motors, and two back buttons that can be remapped on the fly. The eye-catching design features Samus Aran wearing her Varia Suit and a space-themed background on the right. The Metroid Prime logo is on the left grip. The controller can run for up to 30 hours between charges and comes with a 10-foot USB-C cable.

PowerA Metroid Prime Trilogy Wired Gaming Earbuds
$25
PowerA's Metroid Prime-themed gaming earbuds look pretty cool, but it's worth noting upfront that the controller doesn't have a 3.5mm headphone jack. The Switch 2 console, however, does support wired earbuds.The $25 earbuds feature Metroid iconography on each side and three swappable silicone tips. It has an inline microphone for voice chat, 8mm dynamic audio drivers, and an adjustable slider to prevent the wires from becoming tangled. Honestly, though, the coolest feature might be the drawstring storage bag, as it features three pieces of key art depicting Samus based on her appearances in the original trilogy.

Speaking of the Metroid Prime Trilogy, the highly anticipated, official visual retrospective is slated to release October 28. Made by the team behind the beautiful Legend of Zelda strategy guides, Metroid Prime 1-3: A Visual Retrospective is a 208-page cloth hardcover that sounds like a must-read book for fans.The book includes concept art, sketches, and illustrations as well as commentary from Retro Studios developers and other behind-the-scenes materials such as producer's notes from Nintendo's archives. The book covers Metroid Prime, Prime 2: Echoes, Prime 3: Corruption, and Metroid Prime Remastered.Series producer Kensuke Tanabe wrote the foreword for the book, and each game's section is introduced by a developer from Retro Studios.We have yet to see any of the pages, but the etched metallic-foil illustration of Samus on the cover looks awesome. Publisher Piggyback printed the book on premium art paper and stitched the pages to the binding. The hardcover is wrapped in cloth, which adds to the collectible-quality aesthetic.
