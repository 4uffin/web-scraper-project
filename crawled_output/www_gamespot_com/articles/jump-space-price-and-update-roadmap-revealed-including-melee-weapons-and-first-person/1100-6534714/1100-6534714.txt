Jump Space is almost ready to exit space port and enter early access. Ahead of the game's debut later this month, Keepsake Games has set the price for Jump Space and laid out the update calendar well into 2026.On Bluesky, Keepsake announced that Jump Space's early access release will be available for $20 on Xbox Series X|S and PC on September 19. Chapter 1: The Resistance Coalition will begin at the start of early access, with Chapter 2: Atira Strikes Back launching by early 2026. In a series of short updates in that time frame, Keepsake plans to introduce text chat, hangar vendors, a ship shield revamp, melee weapons, an expanded story, new missions, photo mode, and other additions.The roadmap for Jump Space's updates.In Q1 2026, Chapter 3: Secrets of the Telmari will bring support for a first-person mode, more sectors, a scanner revamp, voice chat, new enemies, and a ground boss into the game. There are plans for Chapter 4: Heart of Corruption before the game exits early access. However, there are no dates or concrete details about when that might occur.Until fairly recently, this game was known as Jump Ship before the name was changed over trademark issues. Jump Space is a co-op game that brings together up to four players as the crew of a ship that can control and repair their shared vessel. The gameplay resembles Left 4 Dead and Sea of Thieves, with some additional sci-touches touches like planetary exploration and space walks. It's a dangerous galaxy out there, and players will run into trouble when enemies appear during on-foot encounters or during space combat when the crew is still on their ship. However, the game is strictly PvE, rather than PvP.Keepsake Games has previously mentioned that Jump Space will feature several "handcrafted missions with random elements" to keep the game fresh. More than 1 million players have wishlisted Jump Space on Steam. For now, the game will only be available on Xbox Series X|S and PC.Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on GoogleThe Best PC Games To Play In 2025See More
