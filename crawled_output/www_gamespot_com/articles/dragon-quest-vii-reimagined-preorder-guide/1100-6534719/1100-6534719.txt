Dragon Quest VII Reimagined is a ground-up remake of the original PS1 version of Dragon Quest VII that launched in 2000. This is actually the second remake of the sprawling console JRPG; it was also remade for the Nintendo 3DS in 2016. However, Reimagined looks to be an even bigger overhaul of the game, featuring a gorgeous new artstyle reminiscent of sculpted figurines that resembles the FMV cutscenes of the PS1 version. It also maintains the top-down viewpoint of the PS1 version. Based on what we've seen so far, the new visual style looks to be a great fit for the late Akira Toryiama's classic character and monster designs.According to the announcement trailer and the game's official website, Dragon Quest VII Reimagined will also make notable changes to the story and gameplay. While the exact changes to the story have not been detailed, Square Enix says the narrative has been "reworked to be pacier and more accessible to players," which isn't surprising, considering the PS1 and 3DS versions are notoriously large games that can easily take over 100 hours just to complete the main storyline.On the gameplay side, Reimagined maintains the turn-based battles of the original game, with the option to increase battle speed or turn on auto-battling. Like the 3DS version, Reimagined will let players see monster encounters on the field, and you'll automatically defeat low-level enemies without having to enter combat. The game will also feature a reworked class system that lets party members select two classes at once, as well as tweaks and updates to each of the various vocations.Dragon Quest VII Reimagined isn't the only upcoming Dragon Quest remake. Dragon Quest 1 & 2 HD-2D Remake also launches on PS5, Xbox, Switch 2, Switch, and PC on October 30. Preorders are available for $60 on al platforms. The game will feature enhanced versions of the first two Dragon Quest games from the 1980s with all-new graphics, gameplay updates, and even new content. The new HD-2D version follows up a similar HD-2D remake for Dragon Quest 3 that launched last year on all consoles, and recently got a Switch 2 Edition upgrade that increases performance on Nintendo's new handheld. Eventually, we'll hopefully hear more about the long-awaited Dragon Quest 12, but these remakes of classic entries in the series will keep fans busy until then.More Dragon Quest remake deals
