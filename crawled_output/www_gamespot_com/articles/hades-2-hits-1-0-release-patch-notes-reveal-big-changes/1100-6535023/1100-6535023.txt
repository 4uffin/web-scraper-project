Hades 2 has officially launched in full, and the day-one patch notes reveal just how far the game has come since it started its early-access journey. Currently available for PC and Switch consoles, the 1.0 version of Hades arrives with a substantial number of changes to the game, ranging from minor tweaks to new additions that'll keep you exploring the Underworld for hours on end.Some of the biggest highlights here include the true ending of the game, so if you want to see how Princess Melinoe's story really concludes, you'll want to go give Chronos a good kicking. Supergiant Games added that this ending will not change key events in the game, and earning it will unlock the final Vow of Rivals rank. Getting to that ending is quite the achievement, and one that will be celebrated with some digital kudos, as 50 different achievements have been unlocked as well.

Now Playing: Hades 2 Review
You do not need to start the game over to earn any achievements, so once you load it up, you may be pleasantly surprised to find these retroactively added to your account. Players can also expect new artwork--like visual effects, environmental art, and other visual improvements--new music to listen to, more decorations to liven up the Crossroads, and even more Keepsakes to collect. Beyond that, there are scores of tweaks to virtually every part of Hades 2, from combat to character animations and much more.If you feel like scrolling through the lengthy patch notes, you can click this link to read about every change, big and small."Hades 2 exits early access as a finely-honed and deeply engaging roguelite that builds upon the strong foundations established by the first game," Alessandro Barbosa wrote in GameSpot's Hades 2 review. "It's larger in every way, with more characters and conversations to enjoy, an entirely new roster of weapons to learn, and deeper customization options to its expanded combat system, yet none of these upgrades compromise Hades' legacy. Rather, Hades 2 improves upon its predecessor in every way, making it a masterfully crafted sequel that is essential to play."If you're looking to dive into one of the best games of 2025, you can check out GameSpot's guides on the best Hades 2 endgame builds, where to find soot to wake up Hypnos in Hades 2, and where to locate the three Fates in Hades 2.Every GameSpot 10/10 Review ScoreSee More
