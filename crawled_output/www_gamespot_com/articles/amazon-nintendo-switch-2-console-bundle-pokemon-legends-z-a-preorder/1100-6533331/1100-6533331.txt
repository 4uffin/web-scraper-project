Amazon has restocked preorders for the Nintendo Switch 2 Pokemon Legends: Z-A Bundle. The retailer opened preorders September 12, nearly two months after its competitors, and sold out in a few days. The $500 console bundle is back in stock as of September 22. In case it sells out again, it's worth noting that the retailer has removed the invitation system from the Mario Kart World Switch 2 Bundle and standalone console, so anyone can buy a Switch 2 from Amazon now. The Pokemon Legends: Z-A Bundle launches October 16 alongside the new game. Like the Mario Kart Bundle, you get a digital copy of Pokemon Legends: Z-A for Switch 2.Preorders for the bundle are also available at Walmart, Target, and Best Buy. Multiple of those retailers have sold out at least once, and the bundle remains out of stock at GameStop.

The Pokemon bundle is essentially replacing the Mario Kart launch bundle. Nintendo hasn't revealed an exact end date for the Mario Kart edition, but it was initially revealed as a release-window promotional offer expiring Fall 2025.Just like with the Mario Kart bundle, this bundle saves you money versus buying the $450 console and $70 game separately. You're saving $20 overall with the Pokemon bundle, whereas the Mario Kart bundle offers a $30 savings due to Mario Kart World's $80 MSRP.Unlike Mario Kart World, Pokemon Legends isn't a Switch 2 exclusive; the open-world adventure will also be available on the original Switch for $60.
