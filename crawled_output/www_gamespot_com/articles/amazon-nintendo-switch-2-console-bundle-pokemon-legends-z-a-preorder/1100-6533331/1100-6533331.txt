Nearly two months after preorders first opened at competing retailers, Amazon now has the Nintendo Switch 2 Pokemon Legends: Z-A Bundle in stock for $500. And unlike Amazon's listings for the Mario Kart World Bundle and standalone console, you don't need to request an invite to place your preorder. The new bundle launches October 16, the same day as the game. Like the Mario Kart World Bundle, you'll get a digital copy of Pokemon Legends: Z-A with the console.Preorders are also still available at Walmart and Target, but the bundle is sold out at Best Buy and GameStop.

$500 | Valued at $520 | Releases October 16
This bundle is essentially replacing the Mario Kart World launch bundle, which has always been listed as a limited-time bundle expiring this fall. An exact end date for the Mario Kart Switch 2 bundle hasn't been revealed, but it seems likely that it'll be gone when the Pokemon bundle hits store shelves on October 16.Just like with the Mario Kart bundle, this bundle saves you money versus buying the $450 console and $70 game separately. You're getting a $20 discount by opting for the bundle. But unlike Mario Kart World, Pokemon Legends isn't a Switch 2 exclusive; the game will also be available on the original Switch for $60.
