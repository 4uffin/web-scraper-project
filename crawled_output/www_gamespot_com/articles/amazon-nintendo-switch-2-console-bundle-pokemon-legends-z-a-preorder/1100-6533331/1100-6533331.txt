Nintendo Switch 2 Pokemon Legends: Z-A Bundle

Preorder at Amazon Preorder at Walmart Preorder at Target Preorder at Best Buy Preorder at GameStop
Nearly two months after preorders first opened at competing retailers, Amazon now has the Nintendo Switch 2 Pokemon Legends: Z-A Bundle in stock for $500. If it sells out, it's worth noting that the retailer has removed the invitation system from the Mario Kart World Switch 2 Bundle and standalone console, so anyone can buy a Switch 2 from Amazon now. The Pokemon Legends: Z-A Bundle launches October 16 alongside the new game. Like the Mario Kart Bundle, you get a digital copy of Pokemon Legends Z:A for Switch 2.Preorders are also still available at Walmart and Target, but the bundle is sold out at Best Buy and GameStop.

This bundle is essentially replacing the Mario Kart World launch bundle, which has always been listed as a limited-time bundle expiring this fall. An exact end date for the Mario Kart Switch 2 bundle hasn't been revealed, but it seems likely that it'll be gone when the Pokemon bundle hits store shelves on October 16.Just like with the Mario Kart bundle, this bundle saves you money versus buying the $450 console and $70 game separately. You're getting a $20 discount by opting for the bundle. But unlike Mario Kart World, Pokemon Legends isn't a Switch 2 exclusive; the game will also be available on the original Switch for $60.
