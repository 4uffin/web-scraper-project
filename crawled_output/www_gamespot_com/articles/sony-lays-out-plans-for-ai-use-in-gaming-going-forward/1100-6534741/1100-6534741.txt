Sony has spoken once again about exactly how it is utilizing AI in video game development, which it says allows it to accelerate and streaming the process. The company has already utilized some AI use with Spider-Man 2 and even tested some models using Horizon Zero Dawn's Aloy. However, Sony believes AI should support creativity, not replace it, according to its own mission statement about its own AI tool called Enterprise LLM, which helps employees across the company use AI safely.According to its 2025 corporate report, since 2023, over 50,000 people in 210 different teams have started using this system. Employees are using it not just for chat or writing help, but also by connecting it directly to their daily work tools. So far, Sony has tested more than 300 AI projects, with over 50 now part of regular work routines.To make sure AI is used safely, Sony is also working closely with teams that focus on legal issues, privacy, and ethics. In the process, clearer rules are being created for how AI should be used, especially to avoid problems like copying music or other content without permission. The company is also using AI to help protect creators' work by building systems that can detect if something has been stolen or used without approval. At the same time, Sony is using AI to make older movies sound better and to improve picture quality on the PS5 with new upscaling tech.Some in the gaming industry agree that changes like these are needed. Masahiro Sakurai, the famous game developer known for Kirby and Super Smash Bros., said big games take too much time and effort to make and that the current way of doing things can't last. He believes AI could help teams work faster and smarter, especially in large game studios. Sakurai said only the studios that adapt to AI will be able to keep up in the future.AI in gaming is still a hot topic. Some companies, like Activision, are already using AI tools during game development, but say they don't use AI to replace creative work as everything is still "human-created and touched."Others are more cautious and have genuine concerns. Last year, a deal between SAG-AFTRA, the actors' union, and an AI voice company called Replica Studios caused controversy. This past May, a group of video game companies made important changes to their offer in an effort to end the actors' strike led by SAG-AFTRA. Since the beginning of the strike, which finally ended in June, SAG-AFTRA had pushed for stronger protections around how these digital replicas are used and how actors are paid for them.Samantha Beart, who played Karlach in Baldur's Gate 3, has criticized the use of AI in the entertainment industry for short-term profit, warning that it could lead to long-term damage. Beart emphasized that actors won't back down in the fight against AI, as accepting it could mean giving up their careers. She added that while the industry is filled with passionate, creative people, it's being influenced by investors who don't play games and are only focused on quick returns.Even Microsoft, which had reaffirmed its $80 billion investment in artificial intelligence for 2025, openly acknowledged that AI advancements will lead to job losses--a long-anticipated consequence in certain sectors.The Best PS5 Games In 2025See More
