Hitman: World of Assassination Anniversary Edition (PS5)
$50 | Releases October 17
Preorder at Best Buy
It's not often that every entry in a video game trilogy is satisfying from start to finish, but in the case of Hitman: World of Assassination, that series is the very definition of perfect execution. If you haven't played it yet, all three Hitman games from IO Interactive--the developer of the upcoming James Bond game 007: First Light--are getting a new PS5 collection dubbed the Hitman: World of Assassination Anniversary Edition. The $50 collection launches on October 17, and preorders are available through Best Buy.
Hitman: World of Assassination Anniversary Edition (PS5)
$50 | Releases October 17
The PS5-exclusive Hitman: world of Assassination Anniversary Edition includes all three of IO Interactives latest Hitman titles--Hitman, Hitman 2, Hitman 3--plus a selection of DLC content like The Banker cosmetics pack and the Celebrity Elusive Targets pack, as well as several physical extras like a lenticular card featuring a collage of key art from across the entire history of Hitman and a 3D shadowbox portrait of Agent 47. Here's a full breakdown of everything includedHitman: World of Assassination base game (includes Hitman, Hitman 2, and Hitman 3)Hitman lenticular cardAgent 47 3D Shadowbox portraitCelebrity Elusive Targets DLCThe Banker cosmetic DLCNote that while this is a physical copy of the game, you'll still need an internet connection to access all of the content available for the games.

Hitman: World of Assassination (PS5)
$40
If you can't wait, you can pick up the standard Hitman: World of Assassination edition for $40 on PS5, but considering that the Anniversary Edition offers a lot of extra physical and digital content for only $10 more, it might be worth waiting for that deluxe version instead.

Hitman: World of Assassination Signature Edition (Switch 2)
$60
Nintendo Switch 2 owners can also get Hitman: World of Assassination Signature Edition for $60, and this is a comprehensive package that also offers the full campaigns for all three games, Contracts mode, Escalation, Elusive Target arcades, Freelancer mode, Sniper Assassin mode, and more. Admittedly, performance on Switch 2 isn't the best--but fixes are on the way--and this is a Game Key Card version of the game, so you'll need to have a chunk of free space on the Switch 2 SSD to store the game on.You'll also get exclusive--and stylish--DLC, that you can use to dress Agent 47 up like a Mario or a Luigi cosplayer on the Paris fashion circuit.

So what makes Hitman so great? Following the mixed reception to Hitman: Absolution, IO Interactive went back to basics with the next chapter in the series. The soft reboot of Hitman was released in an episodic format, and it was followed by Hitman 2 and Hitman 3 in short succession. Improvements from the sequels were retroactively applied to the older games, and the entire experience plays like a toybox for assassins.Each mission gives you a target to pursue and execute--don't worry, they're always terrible people or actor Sean Bean--and the magic here comes from figuring out how to make each assassination look like a freak accident. There are opportunities to get rid of your marks with ballistic or neck-snapping methods, but it's far more fun to use killer Yoga, sabotaged race cars, or a vegan cake to deliver some karmic justice. The Hitman games have also been supported with several pieces of substantial post-launch content over the yearsWith this version of the game, you're also getting more than just dozens of highly replayable levels. Several modes like Contracts, Escalation, and the roguelike Freelancer will push your skills and your lethal creativity to the limit. If you'd like an idea of what you can expect, you can check out GameSpot's reviews for Hitman, Hitman 2, and Hitman 3.As mentioned above, IO Interactive is also working on a James Bond game. 007 First Light launches March 27, 2026, on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch 2, and PC, and two physical editions are available to preorder at Amazon. The $70 Specialist Edition comes with several in-game bonuses, but if you feel like spoiling yourself, there's the $300 Legacy Edition. This comes with a steelbook case, preorder DLC bonuses, a physical copy of 007 First Light, and it's capped off with a replica Golden Gun figurine.
