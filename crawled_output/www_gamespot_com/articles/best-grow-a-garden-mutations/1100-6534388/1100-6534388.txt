Mutations are the key to making your fortune in Grow A Garden. Each one makes plants more valuable, while pets gain the ability to convert plants or other animals into the mutated variant. Therefore, if you want to make a lot of money quickly, you’ll need these mutations or ways to manipulate the odds and get these multipliers easily.Discovering which are the best Grow a Garden mutations is a huge reason why everyone is playing this Roblox game every day. But where do you start? We’ll go over everything you should know in advance about all the mutations available in Grow A Garden. These range from which ones you should focus on getting to start with, to why events are so valuable, and which pets give you the mutation with the highest multiplier.Table of Contents [hide]The best Grow A Garden mutationsAll Grow A Garden Mutations and effectsStandard mutationsEvent mutationsCombining mutations turns an otherwise worthless strawberry into a fruit worth hundreds of thousands of Sheckles.The best Grow A Garden mutationsThe best Grow a Garden mutations are:CosmicShockedParadisalCelestialDawnboundSundriedFrozenZenCorruptDiscoMeteoricObviously, the best Grow A Garden mutations are the ones that give you the highest multiplier bonus for selling the affected plants at the shop. For example, Cosmic, Shocked, Paradisal, Celestial, and Dawnbound all give the highest increase of values available in the base game without any events. However, they’re also the most difficult to obtain as they require either luck for the plant to be hit by lightning or meteors, combining even rarer weather effects, or submitting sunflowers to a god that rarely appears. Pets with the Ascended mutation give plants a whopping 150 times their value, but you’ll rarely, if ever, see them.As for the more commonly available base game weather events, Heat Wave weather gives Sundried mutations, which have a massive 85x multiplier. They’re rare, but only require the Heat Wave weather to be in effect to apply to your crops or pets. The rates do drop significantly from here, though a Frozen crop gives 10 times the value of the base crop and is relatively easy to get, provided a Wet or Drenched plant is subjected to a Frost weather effect. Sushi Bears also grant plants the Frozen effect.Your best bet is to focus on the event-only weather conditions and unlocking the associated pet. Obtaining the animal companion requires a lot of investment of time and resources, completing event quests, and eventually buying the egg to stand a chance to hatch the correct critter. Some events also trigger effects, such as the Zen update’s Zen and Corrupt weather, which automatically converted plants and gave them an extra 20 times their overall value. The most valuable event pets in the game are the Disco Bee and the Lobster Thermidor, as they have a chance to affect your crops with the Disco and Meteoric mutations, respectively, granting affected plants 125 times their value.Even something as simple as the humble carrot can become somewhat valuable when it's made of gold.All Grow A Garden Mutations and effectsStandard mutationsThese mutations are available at any time in the game, but outside of having a developer or content creator use Grow A Garden cheats and console commands, the appearance of these weather effects is random.MutationSheckles MultiplierObtaining MethodsSilverX5During the Crystal Beam weather.Apply Silver Fertilizer gear.10% chance to grow instead of normal plant.Goldx201% chance to grow instead of normal plant.Applied by Dragonfly or Golden Bee pets.Applied during Golden Bee pet while harvesting.Rainbowx500.1% chance to grow instead of normal plant.Applied by Butterfly pet when crop has 5+ environmental mutations, removing all other mutations when it does so.Wetx2During Rain and Thunderstorm weather.Applied by Sprinklers, Sea Turtle or Kappa pets, and the Mutation Spray Wet item.Windstruckx2During Windy or Gale weather.Applied by Pterodactyl or Windy mutated pets.Use Mutation Spray Windstruck.Moonlitx2During Night weather (up to six plants mutated every two minutes).Applied by Tanuki pet.Chilledx2During Frost weather.Applied by Polar Bear, Tanuki, or Sushi Bear pets.Use Mutation Spray Chilled.Chocx2Use Chocolate Sprinkler.During Chocolate Rain weather (dev only)Applied by Tanuki pet.Use Mutation Spray ChocPollinatedx3During Bee Swarm, Worker Bee Swarm, or Beenado weather.Applied by Bee, Honey Bee, Petal Bee, Queen Bee, Wasp, Tarantula Hawk, Pack Bee, or Golden Bee pets.Use Mutation Spray Pollinated.Sandyx3During Sandstorm weather.Applied by Jackalope pet.Clayx3Plant affected by Wet and Sandy mutations.Crackedx4Applied by the Badger pet.During Earthquake weather.Verdantx4During Solar Flare or Sunset weathers.Applied by Scarlet Macaw pet.Use Mutation Spray Verdant.Bloodlitx5During Blood Moon weather.Replace Wet into Bloodlit by using the Kappa pet.Twistedx5During Tornado weather if hit by tornadoes.Chance to be applied by Pterodactyl if not already Windstruck.Drenchedx5During Tropical Rain, Water Your Garden, Rain Dance, or Tsunami weathers.Can replace Wet mutation during Tropical Rain.HoneyGlazedx5Applied by Bear Bee pet.Use Honey Sprinkler or Mutation Spray HoneyGlazed.Cloudtouchedx5Applied by Hyacinth Macaw pet.Use Mutation Spray Cloudtouched.Frozenx10Combine Wet or Drenched with Chilled mutation.Applied by Sushi Bear or pets with Frozen mutation.User Flower Froster Sprinkler on flower-type plants only.Acidicx12During Acid Rain weather.Tempestuousx12Have the plant affected by Windstruck and Twisted mutations.Acidicx15During Acid Rain weather.Eclipsedx15During Solar Eclipse weather.Ceramicx32Combine Clay with one of the following: Burnt, Fried, Cooked, Molten, Sundred, Meteoric, or Plasma.Friendboundx70Use Friendship Pot when it’s fully grown or have five friends in a server.Sundriedx85During a Heatwave or Solar Flare weather.Aurorax90During Aurora Borealis or Crystal Beam weather.Shockedx100Struck by lightning during Thunderstorm, Jandel Storm, or Flamingo Storm.During Crystal Beam weather.Use Mutation Spray Shocked.Applied by Raiju or Shocked pets (during Thunderstorm weather only) or Firefly pets at any time.Paradisalx100Combine Verdant and Sundried mutations.During Solar Flare weather.Celestialx120Struck during a Meteor Shower weather event.During the Crystal Beam weather.Discox125Applied by Disco Bee pet.During Disco, Monster Mash, DJ Sam, or Boombox Party weather.Hold a Wet Fruit during the Rain Dance weather to give it Disco mutation.Use Mutation Spray Disco.Dawnboundx150Applied by pets with Ascended mutation.During Sun God weather (four players must hold sunflower in front of the Sun God NPC.Cosmicx240Combine Celestial and Aurora mutations.During certain events, it's worth leaving plants to thrive in your garden, just in case a frozen bamboo shoot becomes corrupted.Event mutationsThese mutations are not available through standard play, instead appearing during certain weather effects or requiring limited-time items to activate.
