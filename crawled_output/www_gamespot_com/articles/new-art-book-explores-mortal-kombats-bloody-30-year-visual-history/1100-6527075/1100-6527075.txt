While the 2021 Mortal Kombat movie isn't something you'd consider for a historical tour of the franchise yet, it's still a ton of fun to watch. With its sequel delayed to May 2026, now is a great time to revisit the movie since it's getting a new 4K steelbook release. The new edition launches October 7, and the cover features Scorpion's mask on the front and his deadly kunai on the back. This version also comes with a voucher to claim the digital version of Mortal Kombat, giving you the option to download or stream the film on a wide variety of apps and devices.
