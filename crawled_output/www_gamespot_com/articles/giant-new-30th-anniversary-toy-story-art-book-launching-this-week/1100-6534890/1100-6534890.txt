Disney/Pixar The Color of Toy Story: A 30th Anniversary Celebration of Colorscripts and Creativity
$35 | Releases September 23
Preorder at Amazon
This year marks the 30th anniversary of Pixar's Toy Story, a landmark movie in the early days of CG animation. While the style of animation it pioneered is now ubiquitous, Toy Story had a long road from its initial concept to its debut on the big screen, and you can learn more about its tumultuous production--as well as the creation of its three sequels--with The Color of Toy Story: A 30th Anniversary Celebration of Colorscripts and Creativity. The new hardcover book launches September 23 for $35, and you can still sneak in a last-minute preorder at Amazon.
Disney/Pixar The Color of Toy Story: A 30th Anniversary Celebration of Colorscripts and Creativity
$35 | Releases September 23
Clocking in at an impressive 328 pages, the hardcover book goes behind the scenes on the creation of Pixar's first full-length feature. It features reprints of the original sequential art and colorscripts for Toy Story and its follow-ups. Similar to movie storyboards, colorscripts serve as a visual guide for the animation team during production. Along with the colorscripts, the book also includes insights from artists and animators who worked on the series, offering details on the creation of iconic characters like Woody and Buzz and how their adventures were conceived.

The Art of Toy Story 4
$30 (was $40)
If you're interested in a deeper look at the final film in the series, Amazon still has stock of The Art of Toy Story 4. This art book smaller than the new 30th Anniversary book, but it's still packed with info on the making of the movie accross its 160 pages. As you'd expect, the book contains rare concept art, storyboards, character profiles, and colorscripts from the 2019 movie. It's on sale for $30 (was $40) at Amazon.

Toy Story Manga: 30th Anniversary Edition
$20
The 30th anniversary of Toy Story is being celebrated with a few more books that you can grab right now. Released earlier this year, The Toy Story Manga: 30th Anniversary Edition is a 272-page manga adaptation of the first two films priced at $20, and it comes with a foreword by Shawn P. Krause, who worked as an animator and layout artist on Toy Story. This isn't the only Disney franchise to get a manga adaptation, so if you're wanting to grab a few more Pixar classics retold in print, then you can pick up the Pixar Collection for $26.21 (was $35). This will give you softcover versions of not only the Toy Story manga, but also Monsters Inc, Wall-E, and Finding Dory.We'd also recommend the Toy Story: Little Golden Book Library, as this box set retells each movie with toddler-friendly art. Perfect for when you want to do some quick storytime reading with them before bed.Disney Pixar's Toy Story Manga: 30th Anniversary Edition -- $20Disney Manga: The Pixar Collection box set -- $26.31 ($35)Disney Manga: Pixar's Toy Story Collector's Edition Manga -- $12.60Disney and Pixar Toy Story Little Golden Book Library -- $24.61 ($30)

Toy Story: Storytellers Packs
$16 - $27
A celebration of Toy Story just wouldn't feel right without some toy replicas, would it? While these probably won't come to life and go off on adventures when you're not looking at them, the Toy Story Storytellers packs are cute recreations of the iconic characters. These are available in various editions, and they're pocket-friendly figures that look like they hopped straight off the big screen. Each pack includes key characters from the movies, and they're affordably priced as well.Toy Story Storytellers 4-Pack (Woody, Rex, Ham, Slinky Dog, Bo Peep, and Army Men) -- $27Toy Story Storytellers 6-Pack (Woody, Buzz Lightyear, Bo-Peep, Rex, Forky, and Duke Caboom) -- $54Toy Story Intergalactic Storytellers 3-Pack (Buzz Lightyear, Zurg, and Pixar Alien) -- $16.19Toy Story Storytellers 4-Pack (Woody, Jessie, and Bullseye) -- $22.83Toy Story 30th Anniversary: Woody and Buzz Funko Pops -- $35

Toy Story 30th Anniversary Funko Pop Woody and Buzzy

More Toy Story toys
$20 - $37
While the toys listed below aren't part of the 30th anniversary celebrations, they're still great Toy Story figures regardless. These are all larger action figures that have a high range of articulation, and each one is designed to look as authentic as possible. You're getting all the major players here, like a Buzz Lightyear with LED and voice effects, Jessie is dressed up in finely embroidered clothing, and the iconic claw-worshipping come in a two-pack. They can also come loaded with 11 phrases that they'll speak when you push their action button.Bullseye -- $37 ($40)Buzz Lightyear -- $32.85 ($38)Forky -- $20Jessie -- $32.29Pixar Aliens -- $25Rex -- $38 ($40)Woody -- $33Zurg -- $35 ($40)

Toy Story: Rocket Rescue Buzz Lightyear
$30 (was $39)
Buzz Lightyear is arguably the most toyetic of the Toy Story characters, and one of his best figures is a recreation of the rocket rescue scene from Toy Story. This version of Buzz comes with a--non-functioning, thankfully--rocket strapped to his back, and you can hear movie phrases and rocket sounds when you push his chest buttons. He can also strike a pose, and his space ranger suit has a removable visor so that you can see his winning smile.

Toy Story Blu-rays
$9 - $30
Finally, you can go back to the very beginning with Toy Story on Blu-ray. All four of the main movies have gotten 4K Blu-ray releases over the years, and the original film is just $24 right now instead of its usual $35 price. While the movie visuals might be dated by today's standards, there's still a charm to them and the 4K version is decently upscaled from the original Blu-ray release. You're also getting a healthy amount of bonus features on the included standard Blu-ray disc, like audio commentary with Toy Story's crew, several informative documentaries, deleted scenes, and design galleries.The sequels follow the same pattern--these all come with standard Blu-ray discs loaded with supplemental features and a digital streaming code--so you're getting an extended tour behind the scenes on each movie. If you'd like to get all of them in one go, all four films are available in a Toy Story box set on standard Blu-ray, which also comes with DVD copies and what we'd guess are expired digital streaming codes by now. Each movie also includes its respective bonus materials.If you really want to flesh out the collection, you can also pick up the Toy Story spin-offs currently available on Blu-ray and DVD. Toy Story: That Time Forgot sees the gang facing off against dangerously delusional action figures, and Toy Story of Terror is a Halloween story set in a roadside motel.Toy Story 4-Movie Collection (Blu-ray) -- $41.19Toy Story 4-Movie Collection (DVD) -- $28Toy Story (4K) -- $24.39 ($35)Toy Story 2 (4K) -- $27.39 ($35)Toy Story 3 (4K) -- $29.15Toy Story 4 (4K) -- $8.89 ($11.87)Toy Story: That Time Forgot (Blu-ray) -- $21Toy Story: That Time Forgot (DVD) -- $12.63 ($15)Toy Story of Terror (Blu-ray) -- $9.74Toy Story of Terror (DVD) -- $9.32
