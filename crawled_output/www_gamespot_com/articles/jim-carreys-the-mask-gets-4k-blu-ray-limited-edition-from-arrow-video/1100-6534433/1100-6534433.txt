The Mask Limited Edition (4K Blu-ray)
$45 (was $60) | Releases November 11
Released in 1994, The Mask was one of three blockbusters starring Jim Carrey that year, cementing his status as the next breakout star in Hollywood. It's hard to imagine anyone but Carrey pulling off the role as mild-mannered Stanley Ipkiss and his zany counterpart as successfully as he did, as the comedic actor's talent for delivering laughs and his malleable face were key factors in the film's success. Directed by Chuck Russell, The Mask was a big gamble for distributor New Line Cinema, but it paid off handsomely with an impressive box office haul of $351 million at the time.The popularity of the film led to an animated series adaptation, and a few years later, a sequel was made that we'd really really like to forget about.This new version of The Mask is a 4K restoration of the film from the original camera negative by Arrow Video that was approved by Russell himself. The 4K edition supports High Dynamic Range--Dolby Vision and HDR10--as well as lossless stereo, DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 surround sound, and a new Dolby Atmos mix.Like other Arrow Video releases, the Limited Edition comes with a reversible sleeve and cover art: One side has the original theatrical poster featuring Carrey's toothy grin, while the other is a simple but striking shot of the Mask as he prepares to P-A-R-T-Y. You'll also find an illustrated booklet with commentary from author Alexandra Heller-Nicholas and original production notes, a double-sided fold-out poster featuring two original artwork options, and six postcard-sized reproduction art cards.

Then check out the original The Mask comicsThe Mask Omnibus EditionsThe Mask was an adaptation of the comic book miniseries of the same name published by Dark Horse Comics. While the film was lighthearted and played like a live-action Looney Tunes cartoon whenever Jim Carrey donned the ancient relic, the comics it was adapted from were much darker in comparison and featured more over-the-top graphic violence. While Jim Carrey's version of Stanley Ipkiss is a lovable loser with a heart of gold, the comic book version isn't nearly as likable, and once he gets his hands on the mask, he quickly uses its power to brutally exact revenge on everyone who harmed him.The Mask Omnibus Volume 1 (Paperback) -- $23.62 ($30)The Mask Omnibus Volume 2 (Paperback) -- $30Some of these scenes made it into the movie, albeit toned down. For example, the mechanics who extort Ipkiss in the film are humiliated by his alter-ego, but in the comics, they meet a gruesome end at his hands. Other characters are gunned down in cold blood and the book doesn't have a happy ending for Ipkiss. If you'd like to see just how absurdly violent the original comic is, you can pick it up right now as part of The Mask Omnibus Edition for just $23.62 (was $30). After the film became a blockbuster hit, more comic books were produced under several creative teams, but nothing beats the original mini-series by John Arcudi and Doug Mahnke, as it's a grim tale about revenge and how absolute power corrupts absolutely.New & Upcoming Arrow Video Limited Edition 4K Blu-raysThe Mask is just the proverbial tip of the 4K Blu-ray spear for Arrow Video, as the company has several other cult-classics on the way.
