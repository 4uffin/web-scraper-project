The Last of Us Season 2's Limited Edition Steelbook is up for grabs for $35 (was $45) at Amazon ahead of the HBO show's 4K Blu-ray release tomorrow, September 23. Amazon is the only retailer offering the $10 discount. The Steelbook Edition is currently priced at $40 at Walmart and Gruv. If you're interested in owning the collectible 4K Blu-ray edition of Season 2, it's not a bad idea to snag a copy soon, seeing as the Steelbook Edition for Season 1, which launched in March, now sells for rather high prices on the reseller market. Plus, Season 2's 4K Steelbook is the same price as the standard 4K edition.

The Last of Us Season 2's Limited Edition Steelbook features promotional photography of Joel (Pedro Pascal) and Ellie (Bella Ramsey) with Cordyceps fungus forming a moth--like Ellie's tattoo--in the background. The interior artwork shows Ellie surrounded by a horde of people who have succumbed to the Cordyceps fungus.The three-disc set includes all seven episodes of Season 2 in native 4K (2160p) resolution and supports Dolby Vision and HDR10. The infected's growls and the unsettling calling card of Clickers should sound pretty unnerving with Dolby Atmos audio and 7.1 lossless surround sound. All 4K Blu-ray and Blu-ray editions of The Last of Us Season 2 have the same bonus features, most of which originally aired on HBO Max. There are two brand-new exclusive bonus features, though. One is called Ellie's Ultimate Revenge and explores Ellie's motivations throughout Season 2. The other new bonus featurette is Beneath the Surface: The Visual FX of The Last of Us, a deep dive into the props, special effects, and backdrops from the show.The Last of Us Season 2 Bonus Features:Ellie's Ultimate Revenge (New)Beneath the Surface: The Visual FX of The Last of Us (New)Growing the World of The Last of UsWelcome to Jackson set tourJoel's Journey to Season 2Ellie's Journey to Season 2Q&A with Pedro Pascal and Bella RamseyBattle of Jackson, DeconstructedOpen Book: Isabela & Young MazinoMushroom Taste Test4 Character featurettes: Joel, Ellie, Abby, Dina7 "Making of" featurettes (Episodes 1-7)

The Last of Us: Season Two Limited Edition SteelbookThe Last of Us Season 2 continued HBO's largely faithful adaptation of the Naughty Dog video game franchise. While Season 1 had nine episodes, Season 2 only had seven. The new season adapted a portion of The Last of Us Part II, though it was largely told from Ellie's perspective. Season 3 is expected to flip the script and follow Abby, the other playable character from the second game.While the show's overarching storyline has remained aligned with the games--some of the scenes are nearly identical--it has, at times, explored previously uncharted backstories and introduced new characters within self-contained episodes.The Last of Us Season 1 on 4K Blu-rayThe Last of Us: Season 1 (4K Blu-ray) -- $20The Last of Us: Season 1 (Blu-ray) -- $16As mentioned, the Steelbook Edition for The Last of Us Season 1 sold out earlier this year. If you still need to pick up Season 1, the 4K Blu-ray standard edition is only $20 at Amazon or Walmart. The standard Blu-ray version is $16 at Walmart and $20 at Amazon.The Last of Us Season 1 Special FeaturesAs mentioned above, you're also getting a solid selection of extra content here. Each of the nine episodes come with short documentaries, and some of the documentaries on the fourth include a look at how the video game was adapted for TV, profiles of the actors, and the connections between the video game source material and the TV show. Here's the full list of Season 1 bonus content:Inside the Episode (No. 1-9)Controllers Down: Adapting The Last of UsFrom Levels to Live ActionThe Last of Us: Stranger than FictionAshley Johnson SpotlightGet To Know Me actor profilesIs This a The Last of Us Line?The Last Debrief with Troy BakerIf you also love the Naughty Dog game series, there's a pretty interesting book releasing this holiday.

Preorders are available for $70 at Amazon ahead of the book's December 16 release.
