If you’re not scoring goals in EA Sports FC 26, then you’re not going to win any games. In Ultimate Team, you’ll need to have different skills up your sleeves in order to beat your opponent. To that end, we’d recommend varying your shots and learning how to beat the keeper with low driven shots.How to do low driven shots in FC 26To perform a low driven shot, you’ll need to press B / Circle to power up your shot and then B / Circle again straight away. This will take some practice as the second button needs to be pressed almost immediately after powering your shot. You’ll want to aim for the area you want to place the ball, too.This is different from the low driven finesse shot, which can be completed by pressing RB/R1 while double tapping B/Circle, and the low driven power shot, which can be completed by holding LB and RB / L1 and R1 while double tapping B/Circle.Low driven shots are a great way to beat the keeper in the box.The low driven shot is brilliant for drilling balls past the goalkeeper into the bottom corners of the net. Finesse shots are better if you’re coming in off the wing and need a bit of spin on the ball, while power shots are brilliant to use if you’ve got the time to perform them.Since all three take a bit of time to perfect, we’d recommend trying the shots out in Moments or low-difficulty Squad Battles.Obviously, you’ll need players with a high shooting stat to pull these shots off, but if you want the time to perfect it, you’ll also need someone with a decent amount of pace to break through the defence and go one on one with the keeper. You can also invest in players like Milito or Haaland who have the Low Driven Shot Playstyle, which will increase your overall chances of execution.While there were different metas in the game last year, low driven shots were one of the most broken mechanics and presumably that’ll continue this year.The Biggest Game Releases Of September 2025See More
