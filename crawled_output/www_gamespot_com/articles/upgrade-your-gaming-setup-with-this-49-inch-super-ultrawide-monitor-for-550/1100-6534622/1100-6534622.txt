Innocn produces a bunch of great, budget-friendly monitors. I personally have been using one of its 40-inch models for years--whether it's working or gaming, it's handled everything I throw at it with ease. Amazon is now discounting several Innocn 49-Inch Curved Gaming Monitors, all of which are billed as limited-time deals that'll likely end in the coming days. Some are discounted by over $300, making this a great time to be in the market. So if you have the space on your desk and want a gaming monitor the size of a small TV, take a look at these reliable super ultrawide displays.

Resolution: 3840 x 1080Refresh Rate: 144HzResponse Time: 1msWith a 3840 x 1080 resolution, 144Hz refresh rate, and 1ms response time, this monitor should work for both a dedicated battlestation or a hyper-productive home office. The stand can tilt and swivel, and its height is adjustable. As for ports, you'll find one DisplayPort, one USB-C port, one HDMI port, a 3.5mm audio port, and several USB-A ports for all your accessories.Color performance meets the standards for Display HDR 400, and Adaptive-Sync should bring images to life with impressive clarity for a $550 display. The monitor can even be configured to display inputs from two different sources. That's a pretty nifty feature, and since the product is currently matching its lowest price ever, it's the ideal time to scoop it up.Be sure to also take a look at the Innocn 49-Inch Curved Gaming Monitor (1440p, 120Hz), which boasts a reduced refresh rate but impressive 1440p resolution. It's a bit more expensive at $617.49 (was $795), but it could be worth the extra cash if you're accustomed to 1440p resolution.
