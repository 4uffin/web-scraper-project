Lego's new Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse minifigure collection is back in stock at Amazon. Spider-Man fans can get mystery boxes with six Lego minifigures for $30 while supplies last. Walmart also restocked 6-packs today (September 18), but only a few units remain, so it's likely to sell out before the end of the day. Target sold out of the Spider-Verse collection earlier this month, and it's on backorder at the Lego Store; orders placed today at the Lego Store are expected to ship October 13.Lego Minifigures: Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse features 12 different characters from the beloved animated film. In addition to the $30 mystery boxes with six minifigures, select retailers have singles. At the time of writing, single Spider-Verse minifigures were in stock at the Lego Store and Best Buy. Strangely, Best Buy is currently charging $4.24 per minifigure for online orders.Lego Minifigures: Spider-Verse 6-Pack -- $30Amazon - In stockWalmart - Low stockLego Store - BackorderedTarget - Sold outLego Minifigures: Spider-Verse -- $5 eachLego Store - In stockBest Buy - In stock ($4.24)Walmart - Sold outTarget - Sold outArticle updated September 18.
Lego Minifigures - Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse 6-Pack
$30
Since we're talking about Spider-Verse here, the set has a few of the zanier Spider-Men from the multiverse, including Werewolf Spider-Man., Spider-Punk, and Sun-Spider.Many of the Spider-Verse minifigures come with accessories. For instance, Spider-Punk has an electric guitar; Web-slinger, otherwise known as Patrick O'Hara, actually comes with a horse figure; and Pavitr Prabhakar's minifigure is accompanied by a cat figure that is reminiscent of Bodega Cat from Marvel's Spider-Man 2. Perhaps most notably, Peter B. Parker has a baby carrier that holds a mini-minifigure of his daughter Mayday.All 12 minifigures come with a display stand for the character and any included accessories.Here's the full list of minifigures in the Spider-Verse collection:Miles Morales (Spider-Man)Prowler (Miles G. Morales)Peter B. Parker (Old Spider-Man)Gwen Stacy (Ghost Spider)Spider-Punk (Hobart Brown)Sun-Spider (Charlotte Webber)Werewolf Spider-Man (Peter Parker)Spider-Byte (Margo Kess)Web-Slinger (Miguel O'Hara)Patrick O'Hara (Web-slinger)Cyborg Spider-Woman (Petra Parker)Pavitr Prabhakar (Spider-Man)It's not impossible to receive a duplicate in these minifigure mystery boxes, but it is unlikely. What is likely, however, is that you'll need to purchase more than two boxes to get all 12 characters in the Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse collection. Unless you're quite lucky.

Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse Lego MinifiguresMore Lego Minifigure CollectionsLego has released some pretty cool minifigure collections over the past year, including a Dungeon & Dragons set. Unfortunately, that set has been discontinued--minifigure collections are retired much faster than regular sets--but you can buy a Dungeons & Dragons 6-pack for $44 (with shipping) from a third-party reseller on Amazon. Earlier this year, Lego launched a collection of 12 miniature F1 race cars; this series is still available, and you can get a 6-pack for only $20 (was $30).Lego Minifigure Mystery 6-PacksLego F1 Collectible Race CarsAmazon -- $20 ($30)Walmart -- $20 ($30)Target -- $21 ($30) | Sold outLego Dungeons & Dragons Minifigures -- $44 | RetiredLego Minifigures Series 27 -- $40 | RetiredLego Minifigures Series 25 -- $40 | Retired

Spider-Man minifigure collectors may also be interested in Lego's larger, articulated action figures, such as this Spider-Man Mech that's on sale for only $9.49 (was $15). The Spider-Man Mech set includes an Anti-Venom minifigure and multiple accessories. Speaking of Venom, he also has his own buildable Lego mech that comes with a Miles Morales minifigure. The Lego Venom Mech is available for $12.50 (was $15).Two of Lego's Spider-Man Construction Figures are available for discounts at Amazon. The 303-piece Iron Spider-Man Construction Figure is only $24 (was $30). If you want Iron Spider-Man to have a villain to fight, check out the 471-piece Green Goblin Construction Figure for $28 (was $35). Heads up: the Green Goblin is retiring soon, so this might be your last chance to buy it for less than MSRP.Spider-Man Mech vs. Anti-Venom (107 pieces) -- $9.49 ($15)Venom Mech vs. Miles Morales (134 pieces) -- $12.50 ($15)Iron Spider-Man Construction Figure (303 pieces) -- $24 ($30)Green Goblin Construction Figure (471 pieces) -- $28 ($35) | Retiring soonSpider-Man Construction Figure (258 pieces) -- $36.49 | Retired, MSRP was $25Miles Morales Construction Figure (238 pieces) -- $43.70 | Retired, MSRP was $25Lego Spider-Man Buildable Action Figures + MechsIron Spider-Man and Green Goblin Construction FiguresWhile you're checking out the Spider-Verse minifigures, take a look at the recently released Lego Minecraft and Star Wars gift set bundles.

The Lego Star Wars 3-in-1 Adventure Gift Set has nine minifigures, five droid figures, multiple vehicles, and more.

In fact, there are two Spider-Man bundles. The first bundle features the two most recent Spider-Man display models for adults: Miles Morales' Mask and the Iron Spider-Man Bust. The other Spider-Man bundle is for kids and themed around Spidey and His Amazing Friends.Spider-Man Lego Bundles at Walmart:Lego Marvel Spider-Man: 2-in-1 Bundle -- $92 ($130)Lego Marvel Spidey & His Amazing Friends: 2-in-1 Bundle -- $75 ($110)

$92 (was $130)
Walmart also has an exclusive bundle with Miles Morales' Mask and the Iron Spider-Man Bust, which launched in August for $60. With Walmart's deal on Miles Morales' Mask, it's actually cheaper to buy each set separately.In any case, Walmart is currently sold out of the Spider-Man bundle--though the retailer has restocked a bunch of its Bricktember Lego bundles over the past few weeks. We wouldn't be surprised to see this one back in stock soon.Includes:Miles Morales' Mask (76329) - $70 (487 pieces)Iron Spider-Man Bust (76326) - $60 (379 pieces)
