8BitDo has revealed an officially licensed controller themed around the popular free-to-play RPG Honkai: Star Rail. Just like the recently released Wuchang: Fallen Feathers collaboration, the Honkai: Star Rail model is an Ultimate 2 Wireless Controller for PC, Apple devices, and Android. The design revolves around Evernight, the mysterious upcoming playable character that's set to join Honkai: Star Rail soon.The Honkai: Star Rail: Evernight 8BitDo Ultimate 2 is available to preorder starting today for $70, which is 10 bucks more than the price of the regular editions (and five bucks more than the Wuchang model). The controller is slated to release this fall; Amazon currently lists the launch date as October 16.8BitDo is also releasing a Collector's Bundle that comes with four stick caps, a themed, hardshell carrying case, temporary tattoo stickers, and a glittery coaster featuring Evernight.

The 8BitDo Ultimate 2 has an impressive list of features, especially when you consider the price. It's equipped with TMR electromagnetic joysticks, which are even more precise and durable than Hall Effect sticks. You'll find two remappable buttons on the back and two extra shoulder buttons. Switches on the back change the triggers from conventional Hall Effect linear triggers to rapid-fire microswitch buttons. The Ultimate 2 also has RGB lighting rings, dual rumble motors, motion controls, and more pro-style features. With 8BitDo's Ultimate Software V2, you can create and save up to three custom profiles as well as adjust settings like stick sensitivity.The Ultimate 2 comes with a matching charging dock, which has a compartment to store the 2.4GHz adapter. This isn't the Bluetooth model, so it won't work on Nintendo Switch 1/2, but the 2.4GHz model also has Bluetooth support for Android, Apple devices, and SteamOS.Key Features2.4GHz Wireless on PC (USB-C dongle)Bluetooth on Apple, Android, SteamOSWired on PCTMR electromagnetic joysticksChange trigger type by flipping switches:
