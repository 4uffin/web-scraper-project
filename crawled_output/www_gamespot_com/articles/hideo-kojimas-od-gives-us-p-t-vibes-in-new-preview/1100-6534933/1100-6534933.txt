Nearly two years ago, Hideo Kojima and director Jordan Peele revealed their upcoming horror game, OD. Since then, Kojima was largely focused on finishing Death Stranding 2: On the Beach. Now, Kojima Productions has shared a fresh look at OD during the Beyond the Strand event. And from the preview, it looks like Kojima is evoking P.T., the playable trailer for his canceled game Silent Hills. The new video redacts some of the backstory text that sets up the game, which makes it difficult to understand what's supposed to be happening. Stephen King's It star Sophia Lillis plays the game's leading character, but most of the action takes place from a first-person perspective. Near the beginning of the clip, Lillis' character receives a card through the door with enigmatic instructions.Lillis' character goes on to light a few candles, and that's where the creep factor rapidly expands. By the time someone--or something--enters the room behind Lillis' character, she's too frightened to run before it lays its hands upon her.Udo Kier and Hunter Schafer will co-star in the game alongside Lillis, but details about their characters have yet to be disclosed. However, Kojima Productions did confirm that the hyper-realistic character models and the game itself were created with Unreal Engine. You can check out some OD screenshots from the trailer in our gallery.OD doesn't currently have a release date, but it will be published by Xbox Game Studios. While that doesn't necessarily rule out a PS5 release, that is yet to be confirmed. Resident Evil 2 and Devil May Cry director Hideki Kamiya recently shared his wish for Kojima to make a P.T.-like game, and it appears that he got his wish.See 40+ Images Of Kojima's Terrifying New Xbox Game, ODSee More
