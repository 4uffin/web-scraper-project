Several games offer the chance to explore real-world locations, but the upcoming Pigeon: A Love Story will make you realize just how big a city can really be. Revealed during the Six One Indie showcase, Pigeon: A Love Story does exactly what it says on the box: You're a pigeon, and you're looking for your life-partner inside of a densely populated metropolitan area like Paris, London, or New York.Not only is each "global pigeon hub" rendered completely to scale, but they're also populated with an "accurate number of pigeons" as well, developer Alex Taylor added.
Described as a slow game for fast times, Pigeon: A Love Story will allow players to explore every building, every street, and every pigeon in a real-time, city-wide simulation. Hundreds of thousands of autonomous pigeon NPCs are flying around, and if the task of finding a feathery soulmate sounds almost impossible, you can team up with a friend to collaborate, compete, or try to find one another.There's even a zen aspect to the romantic adventure, as you can choose to let the game play itself--screensaver-style--and enjoy some digital birdwatching. There's even a chill soundtrack to add some lo-fi vibes to the experience.While this isn't the first game to focus on pigeons--remember Hatoful Boyfriend--it is an ambitious title aiming to simulate the romantic pursuits of these birds. A release date hasn't been set yet, but it will launch for PC via Steam.The Best PC Games To Play In 2025See More
