Yakuza 0 Director's Cut is back on sale for $37 (was $50) at Amazon and Walmart. The $13 discount matches the best price since the Nintendo Switch 2 edition of the stellar action game launched in June. At the moment, Yakuza 0 Director's Cut is exclusive to Switch 2, though it's always been understood that this is a timed exclusive. A new leak suggests the Director's Cut could make its way to PlayStation 5 and PC in December, so that's worth keeping in mind if you have access to multiple platforms.Yakuza 0 is one of two Sega-published RPGs for Switch 2 on sale for a steep discount. Shin Megami Tensei fans can get Raidou Remastered: The Mystery of the Soulless Army for $35 (was $50) on Switch 2 as well as Switch, PS5, and Xbox.

If you've never played a Like a Dragon/Yakuza game, Yakuza 0 is first in the series timeline and the best place to start.Yakuza 0 Director's Cut contains all of the action and drama from the original 2015 game, as well as new scenes created exclusively for this edition and a brand-new English voiceover. On top of that, you'll also be able to take part in online co-op battles through the Red Light Raid mode, teaming you up with players around the world to shake down the seedy underworld of the game's infamous districts.One thing to note about Yakuza 0 and the other Sega Switch 2 games is that it's a Game-Key Card. Essentially, this means that you'll still need to download Yakuza 0 onto your Switch 2 and the cartridge will act as an authentication device. Game-Key Cards are not tied to your Nintendo account, so if you want to sell the game when you're done with it, it will work fine on a different Switch 2 console. An internet connection is only required when booting up a Game-Key Card for the first time, after which the game can be accessed in offline mode on the Switch 2.

Set in 1988 Japan during its financial boom, Yakuza 0 is an origin story for longtime Yakuza characters Kazuma Kyru and Goro Majima, revealing how they became the legends known as the Dragon of Dojima and the Mad Dog of Shimano, respectively. At its core, Yakuza 0 is a 3D beat-'em-up with a heavy emphasis on storytelling, with major beats in the game playing out like episodes of a gangland drama series.In addition to the superb mainline campaign, Yakuza 0 is packed with engaging optional content, including side stories and minigames. About a third of the way through the storyline, you'll unlock Real Estate Royale, a side-story that places Kiryu (you) in the role of an investor who needs to outwit and pummel the Five Billionaires syndicate. Goro also has his own unlockable side hustle managing the Sunshine Cabaret Club. Like the investment side-story, it mixes Yakuza's beat-'em-up gameplay with management sim features. Both modes are surprisingly deep, and either one could work well as a standalone game.If you don't own a Nintendo Switch 2 or are considering buying one as a gift this holiday, Amazon now has all three models in stock, and you no longer need to request an invite to buy one. The Mario Kart World Bundle remains the best value at $499, but you can also preorder the Pokemon Legends: Z-A Bundle for $500 ahead of its October 16 launch.
