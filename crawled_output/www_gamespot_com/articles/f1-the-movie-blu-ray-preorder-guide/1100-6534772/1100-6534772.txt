Formula One racing has become massively popular in the US over the last few years--thanks in part to Netflix series like Drive to Survive--and it was only a matter of time before the sport raced onto the big screen. Released earlier this year, F1: The Movie was a blockbuster hit that starred Brad Pitt, and now you can preorder the upcoming 4K steelbook Blu-ray release for $38 ahead of its release on October 7. Preorders for the standard 4K and Blu-ray versions are available as well.

F1: The Movie 4K Steelbook EditionDirected by Joseph Kosinski (Top Gun: Maverick), F1: The Movie tells the story of former F1 driver Sonny Hayes (Brad Pitt). After a big crash in the '90s saw him walk out on the sport, Hayes has spent three decades as a nomadic racer-for-hire. After his former F1 racing partner, Ruben Cervantes (Javier Bardem), offers him the chance to join his F1 team, Hayes takes him up on his offer as he aims to prove to himself that he has what it takes to race competitively at the highest level.The only problem? Only a handful of races are left in the season, the APXGP team is millions of dollars in debt, and its rookie driver Joshua Pearce (Damson Idris) has an attitude that puts him at odds with Hayes' old-school attitude and skills. Both drivers have to learn to work as a team if they want to finish the season and save APXGP from financial ruin.At the global box office, F1: The Movie earned an impressive $623 million. Critics praised the movie for its ensemble cast and authenticity, as it was filmed during both the 2023 and 2024 F1 seasons. This meant that many real-life F1 drivers appeared in it, including champions like Max Verstappen, Fernando Alonso, and Lewis Hamilton. to add even more authenticity to the movie, F1 commentators Martin Brundle and David Croft provided commentary for the film's races, and these were filmed on real Grand Prix tracks.Beyond the eye for detail, F1: The Movie also does an excellent job at making you feel what it's like to be in the driver's seat. Kosinksi once again teamed up with cinematographer Claudio Miranda to create several stunning shots from behind the wheel, and with the film's cast also driving the story forward, the risks taken in each race felt all too real. Complementing all of this is the score by famed composer Hans Zimmer, which fits the highly technical nature of modern-day Formula One racing perfectly.Blu-ray collectors can look forward to several big releases throughout the year. The Mask is getting a Limited Edition 4K Blu-ray on November 11 from Arrow Video, and the company also has new restorations of Spawn , In the Mouth of Madness, and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Trilogy (4K) arriving throughout the year. Stephen King fans can also preorder an Amazon-exclusive The Long Walk Limited Edition Steelbook for just $35. You can also celebrate the 50th anniversary of one of the greatest musicals of all time, Rocky Horror Picture Show, with a new 4K steelbook release launching October 7.More 4K Steelbook Blu-ray PreordersF1: The Movie Steelbook Edition (4K Blu-ray) -- $44.12 | Releases October 7In The Mouth of Madness Limited Edition (4K Blu-ray) -- $59 | Releases October 28The Long Walk Steelbook Edition - Amazon Exclusive (4K Blu-ray) -- $35 | Release date TBAThe Mask Limited Edition (4K Blu-ray) -- $45 ($60) | Releases November 11Rocky Horror Picture Show 50th Anniversary Collectible Steelbook Edition -- $40 | Releases October 7Spawn Limited Edition (4K Blu-ray) -- $50 | Releases October 7Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Trilogy Limited Edition (4K Blu-ray) -- $70 | December 16More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals & Preorders
