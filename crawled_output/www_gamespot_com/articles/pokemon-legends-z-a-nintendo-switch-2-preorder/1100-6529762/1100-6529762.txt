We're just a month away from the launch of Pokemon Legends: Z-A. If you haven't preordered your copy yet for Nintendo Switch or Switch 2, there's still time to secure exclusive preorder bonuses ahead of Z-A's October 16 release. Preorders for the physical or edition for either platform at Best Buy come with an oversized desk mat featuring a map of Lumiose City and Pokemon key art. Meanwhile, Walmart is giving away an exclusive pin of the game's logo or one of the three starter Pokemon. GameStop also has an exclusive tote bag bonus, but it's only for customers who preorder and pick up the game at midnight when Pokemon Legends: Z-A launches October 16. Pokemon fans who are considering upgrading to the Switch 2 to play Z-A can get a console bundle with the game for $500. The bundle was unveiled back in July, but Amazon just opened preorders September 12. Preorders for the bundle are also still in stock at Walmart and Target. The Switch 2 console bundle releases the same day as the game.

Pokemon Legends: Z-A Preorder BonusesSo far, Walmart, Best Buy, and GameStop are the only major retailers to announce exclusive preorder bonuses, but we wouldn't be surprised if Target and Amazon wind up offering unique bonuses of their own.If you preorder at the Pokemon Center in the US, Canada, or UK, you'll get one random Pokemon Sitting Cuties plush of Chikorita, Tepig, or Totodile.
Pokemon Legends: Z-A Best Buy Bonus
Preorder to get exclusive desk mat ($30 value).
According to Best Buy, the mat is valued at $30, which sounds about right for an oversized desk mat. It has a map of Lumiose City in the center and key art surrounding it. The left side of the mat features the three starter Pokemon and the logos for Switch 2 and Switch. The right side showcases Zygarde and Eternal Flower Floette below the game's logo.Best Buy hasn't revealed the exact dimensions of the desk mat, but it looks like a traditional oversized edition with enough space for a keyboard and mouse. Or perhaps you could use it for Joy-Con 2 mouse controls. Nintendo hasn't confirmed whether Z-A supports the new Switch 2-exclusive control method, but the existence of this desk mat makes us wonder if it's only a matter of time.Technically, ahem, the bonus is a "Gamer Mat," but it's clearly a desk mat/mouse pad with a cloth surface, stitched edges, and (likely) a rubberized base. You could also use the mat for the Pokemon Trading Card Game.

Walmart's store pages had hinted at exclusive bonuses since preorders first opened in early June, and now we know that the retailer's mystery gift is a pin. If you preorder the physical edition for Switch 2 or Switch, you'll get one of the following pins at random:ChikoritaTepigTotodilePokemon Legends: Z-A logo

Pokemon Legends: Z-A for Switch 2
$70 | Releases October 16
The Nintendo Switch 2 version features the full game on the card. It's available to preorder at the following retailers for $70:AmazonWalmart - Exclusive pin with preorder (physical)Best Buy - Exclusive desk mat with preorder (physical/digital)TargetGameStopThe digital edition at Best Buy includes the exclusive desk mat preorder bonus, so even if you don't buy physical games, it makes sense to preorder from a major retailer instead of the eShop. You can preorder the digital edition at Amazon, too.Like other games with separate versions for the old and new Switch consoles, Pokemon Legends: Z-A will take advantage of the Switch 2's superior tech to offer improved overall performance, including higher frame rates and resolution.Pokemon Legends: Arceus had some slowdown, general choppiness, and pop-in on Switch, so it will be interesting to see how Z-A runs on original hardware compared to Switch 2. Hopefully the gap between the two isn't as wide as it is in Pokemon Scarlet & Violet. The latest mainline Pokemon games had rather extreme performance issues on Switch, but the free Switch 2 update has the open-world Pokemon adventure running at 1080p at 60fps.

Z-A is the second game in the Pokemon Legends series. If you haven't played Pokemon Legends: Arceus, which launched back in 2022 and earned rave reviews, you can grab a physical copy for $52 at Amazon or Walmart. Pokemon Legends: Z-A Key Features The sequel to Pokemon Legends: Arceus takes players back to Kalos, the setting of Gen 6's Pokemon X and Y for 3DS. The bustling metropolitan setting of Lumiose City will offer a significant change of pace from rolling hills and wilderness in Pokemon Legends: Arceus. Your first partner Pokemon will be either Chikorita, Totodile, or Tepig. The streamlined catching system from Arceus will return, so you won't have to battle every wild Pokemon you encounter before lobbing a Poke Ball at them. Z-A will also be a major departure in another way: the battle system. The traditional turn-based combat from Arceus and the mainline series will be replaced by a strategic real-time system. You and your partner Pokemon can move during combat encounters--though you'll still be confined to a specific area. Positioning and timing will impact your success on the battlefield, both when attacking and defending incoming attacks by executing dodges. Several features return from Arecus, including the ability to throw Poke Balls without needing to enter a battle--streamlining your quest to catch them all. Along with the new and reworked elements, a familiar system will make its return after a long absence. Mega Evolutions, which last appeared in Pokemon: Let's Go, Pikachu and Eevee in 2018, will temporarily turn your partner Pokemon into a super powerful version of itself. Mega Evolutions also alter the appearance of your Pokemon, but only certain species have Mega Evolutions, and you'll need a Mega Ring and a Pokemon-specific Mega Stone to activate it. We've seen several Mega Evolution Pokemon in trailers so far, including Lucario, Ampharos, and Kangaskhan. Mega Evolutions were originally introduced in Pokemon X and Y, so it's cool that the return trip to Kalos will also have them. Pokemon Legends: Z-A - Mega Dimension DLC Pokemon Legends: Z-A - Mega Dimension DLC As part of the September Nintendo Direct, Nintendo revealed a paid DLC for Pokemon Legends: Z-A called Mega Dimension. The DLC is available to preorder for $30 on the eShop and is expected to launch February 28, 2026. The storyline centers on Mega Evolutions and prominently features Raichu, who has not one, but two Mega Evolutions. Along with the story expansion, the Mega Dimensions DLC comes with Raichu-themed Holo-X and Holo-Y Mega Evolution apparel items, which can be worn when the game launches October 16.
