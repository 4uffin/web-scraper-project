The September Nintendo Direct today had a lot of news about upcoming Switch 2 games, but that wasn't all. During the Super Mario Bros. Wonder segment where a Switch 2 edition was announced, Nintendo also revealed something totally unexpected: a talking flower product you can buy.Based on the talking flowers from Super Mario Bros. Wonder, the real, physical product can speak on their own and say things like, "We kinda look alike, huh?" In the Direct, we saw Nintendo's Yoshiaki Koizumi speak to the flower. However, the flower is not interactive like, say, an Amazon Alexa is. It only speaks. "These talking flowers can make everyday life a little more fun," Koizumi said.Nintendo is getting into the floral business.The talking flowers go on sale in Spring 2026. Pricing has not been announced, however. Super Mario Bros. Wonder and the Meetup in Bellabel Park DLC will launch in Spring 2026 for Switch 2.You can't buy this talking flower yet, but you can purchase another Nintendo plant: the piranha plant camera for the Switch 2.The September Nintendo Direct included some big news, including the Metroid Prime 4: Beyond release date, Resident Evil ports, and the return of the Virtual Boy, including a physical item you can buy for $100. A number of new Nintendo Amiibo toys are on the way as well, demonstrating that Nintendo remains keen on expanding beyond games and into numerous other physical items you can buy.
