Since the days of the PlayStation 3, players have been earning Trophies in their PlayStation games by completing challenges and finishing games, but outside of their online profiles, there hasn't been a way for the most loyal PS fans to show off those in-game achievements. Today, Sony has provided a solution in Franchise Rewards, a new program where unlocking certain trophies will give a player access to special physical "rewards."The program kicks off today with Ghost of Tsushima, and it offers two pieces of unique merch for those who earn certain trophies by December 31. Players who have unlocked the "Mono no Aware" gold trophy can preorder a t-shirt for $30, while those who have unlocked the "Living Legend" platinum trophy can preorder a pin for $25.The Living Legend pin, available to those who unlock Ghost of Tsushima's platinum trophy.A new article on the PlayStation Blog goes into further detail about the special merch, saying that both items were "created with close input from Sucker Punch Productions to make sure they authentically capture the game’s atmosphere and artistry." The blog post also confirms that Ghost of Yotei will join the program "later this year," with details on that merch coming "closer to launch."While the Franchise Rewards program is new for PlayStation and Ghost of Tsushima fans, the idea of earning physical merch for in-game feats has been used by other games in the past. One notable example is Destiny 2, which allowed players to purchase exclusive apparel and other items when they finished newly added raids.Ghost of Tsushima's Ghost Rewards program begins today, while the sequel to Sucker Punch Studios's samurai epic, Ghost of Yotei, is set to launch October 2 exclusively on PlayStation 5.Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on GoogleGhost Of Yotei: Check Out Over 40 New Screenshots Of The PS5 ExclusiveSee More
