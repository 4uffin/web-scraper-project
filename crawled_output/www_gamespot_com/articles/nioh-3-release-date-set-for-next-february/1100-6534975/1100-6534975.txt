Following rumors that Nioh 3 may soon be getting a release date, developer Team Ninja has officially announced the souls-like Action-RPG will be out on February 6, 2026. The announcement comes as a part of PlayStation's September State of Play, in which the publisher gave fans a look at upcoming games like Saros, Battlefield 6, and more.Nioh 3's release date comes as little surprise, however, thanks to an earlier leak from Amazon Japan. Earlier today, the site reportedly had two listings for Nioh 3: a standard-edition release and a "Treasure Box" collector's edition, packed with an art book, mousepad, CD soundtrack, and furry keychain. Both of these listings (via Gematsu) have since been removed, but they did briefly show cover art and collector's edition contents.

Now Playing: Nioh - 3 Minutes of 4K Gameplay
Nioh 3 sees players step into the boots of a fictionalized version of Japan's first shogun, Tokugawa Takechiyo. With supernatural threats on the rise, it's up to Tokugawa to battle these malevolent forces by using both samurai and ninja fighting styles. Team Ninja says that its Ninja Gaiden games inspired a shift in the gameplay, and that players can freely shift between these stances.The samurai fighting style has a unique Ki Pulse ability that can be used after attacking to recover stamina, while the ninja fighting style has a mist ability that can be used to create a doppelganger of Tokugawa that draws enemy attention away from him.Team Ninja’s next game, Ninja Gaiden 4, is launching on October 21. This new installment in the cult-classic Ninja Gaiden series has been co-developed with Platinum Games and features dual protagonists: former Ninja Gaiden hero Ryu Hayabusa, and newcomer Yakumo. Last month, GameSpot released its Ninja Gaiden preview, in which editor Jessica Cogswell wrote, "Ninja Gaiden 4 is shaping up to be a fun reunion for series veterans, as well as a great entry point for newcomers."PlayStation State Of Play September 2025: All The Biggest Announcements And GamesSee More
