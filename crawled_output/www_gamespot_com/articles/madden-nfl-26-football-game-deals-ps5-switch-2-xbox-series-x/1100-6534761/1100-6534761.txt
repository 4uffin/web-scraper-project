Madden 26 is the first entry in the series for a Nintendo console since Madden 13 back in 2012. Madden NFL 26 earned an 8/10 in GameSpot's review thanks to welcome updates to Franchise mode, improved presentation, more realistic player movements, and a variety of other tweaks and additions.

It could come back in stock soon, just like the retailer's $43 deal for the PS5 edition of College Football 26. Here's a quick rundown of the active promotions.

If you're running out of space on your Nintendo Switch 2--Madden NFL 26 will fill more than 20% of the Switch 2's 256GB SSD on its own--it may be time to get a microSD Express Card. Samsung's officially licensed 256GB microSD Express Card is available for $59 at Amazon. For a higher-capacity option, check out the SanDisk Gameplay 512GB microSD Express Card for $78 at Walmart. This is by far the best price for a 512GB model from a major brand. The Walmart-branded Onn 512GB microSD Express retails for $65.77, but it's often sold out and only available in select US regions.
