EA's new Skate game, the first in 15 years, launched this week and put up big numbers on Steam for its early-access release. The launch hasn't gone over totally smoothly, however, as players encountered server issues and other problems. Another issue people are reporting is a "softlock" problem that prevents people from accessing certain points in the skateboarding game."We've seen a lot of reports on getting softlocked in various points--the Isle of Grom Tutorial, various Missions and/or Challenges," the developer wrote in the game's forums. "The Full Circle team are working to identify the cause of the issues and get a fix out as soon as possible, but we need some info."EA is asking people to reply to this thread if they're softlocked--which is to say, they cannot complete a mission, challenge, or the tutorial. Players should submit information like what platform they're on, what specific mission or challenge is affected, and their username."Thanks for your patience. We're on it," EA said.Skate is a free-to-play, always-online game, and the servers ran into issues on launch day. There was an "ongoing outage" overnight that prompted EA to conduct maintenance--and that's now resolved.The version of Skate people are playing now is unfinished and known to include bugs and other issues, which is pretty standard for early-access games. EA and Full Circle have said they will examine feedback to try to make the full release better whenever it's ready.Skate is out now for PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. The game reached more than 80,000 peak concurrent users today on Steam, and that's just on one platform.25 Best Free Games To Play In 2025See More
