Batman: 80th Anniversary Collection offers terrific value, as you're getting 18 animated Batman movies on Blu-ray for just $1.83 each. There are some very good Batman movies included here as well that you won't find ini the newer 85th Anniversary edition, like The Dark Knight Returns Parts 1 and 2, Batman: Ninja, and Batman: Gotham Knight. Even if you purchased the 85th Anniversary 4K Collection, those movies alone are worth buying the 80th Anniversary Collection for.Here's the full list of movies:Batman: Assault on ArkhamBatman: Bad BloodBatman: Gotham by GaslightBatman: Gotham KnightBatman: Mask of the PhantasmBatman: Mystery of the BatwomanBatman: NinjaBatman: Return of the Caped CrusadersBatman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 2Batman: The Killing JokeBatman: Under the Red HoodBatman: Year OneBatman and Harley QuinnBatman Vs.

Batman 85th Anniversary 10-Film Collection (4K Blu-ray)
$80 (was $205)
Batman's 85th Anniversary Collection launched last September with a rather high $205 list price. The current $80 price is a new all-time low for this 4K Blu-ray box set. At this price, you're paying $8 per movie on 4K and digital.It comes with a colorful slipcase and a 24-page commemorative booklet. The box set comes with 4K Blu-ray and digital versions of 10 animated Batman movies:Batman: Mask of the PhantasmBatman Year OneBatman: Assault on ArkhamBatman: The Killing JokeBatman and Harley QuinnBatman: Gotham by GaslightBatman: HushBatman: Soul of the DragonBatman: The Long HalloweenBatman: The Doom That Came to GothamThis is a pretty solid collection of Batman movies. The highlights here are obviously Mask of the Phantasm and Year One, while some of the other entries are fun popcorn flicks you can binge through like comfort junk food. Soul of the Dragon reimagines Batman as a '70s-era martial arts master in a cheesy adventure film starring several other skilled DC fighters, Assault on Arkham is an action-packed dive into Rocksteady's Arkhamverse that mostly focuses on the Suicide Squad, and Gotham by Gaslight puts a Victorian-era spin on Batman.The Killing Joke, Harley Quinn, and Hush don't reach the same heights, but they remain faithful the DC source material and are still worth watching.
