Nintendo Switch 2 Consoles at Amazon
Mario Kart Bundle: $499 / Pokemon Bundle: $500 / Console: $449
See at Amazon
If the recent Nintendo Direct has you thinking about upgrading to the Switch 2, it just became easier to buy the new console from Amazon. The online retailer has removed its invitation system from the Nintendo Switch 2 Mario Kart World Bundle ($499) and the standalone Switch 2 console ($449). Up until this week, Amazon required customers to request an invite and then wait for an approval email. The invitation sometimes arrived the same day, while other times you had to wait a week or longer (if you received an invite at all). But now you can purchase either model just like any other product, and both editions are eligible for Prime shipping; you may even be eligible for same-day delivery.Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World -- $499 | Available nowNintendo Switch 2 + Pokemon Legends Z-A -- $500 | October 16Nintendo Switch 2 -- $449 | Available nowThe removal of the invite system comes a week after Amazon opened preorders for the Pokemon Legends: Z-A Switch 2 Bundle. The new bundle retails for the same price as the Mario Kart edition and launches alongside the brand-new Pokemon adventure on October 16.Check out all three Nintendo Switch 2 console options at Amazon below. And if you want to pair your new console with more Nintendo games and gear, take a look at our roundup of Switch 2 games and accessories available at Amazon.
Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World Bundle
$499 | Available Now
The Mario Kart World launch bundle comes with the Nintendo Switch 2 and a digital copy of the exclusive kart racing game. Since Mario Kart World is one of the few Switch 2 games with an $80 MSRP, this bundle saves you $30 compared to buying the standalone console and game separately.The Mario Kart console bundle is expected to be discontinued this fall. Nintendo hasn't stated an exact end date for the bundle, but we imagine once retailers sell out of their current stock, it will be gone for good.There are two versions of the Mario Kart Bundle in the US: This one has printed artwork on the box, while the other one is a regular Switch 2 box with a sticker. Most people probably won't care too much, but if you like displaying your game console boxes, this version looks nicer.

Nintendo Switch 2 + Pokemon Legends: Z-A Bundle
$500 | Releases October 16
The Pokemon Legends Z-A Bundle effectively serves as the replacement for the Mario Kart World Bundle. Nintendo hasn't revealed how long this one will stick around for, but it's likely considered a 2025 holiday bundle.Pokemon Legends: Z-A retails for $70 on Switch 2, so you're saving $20 versus buying the console and game separately. But unlike Mario Kart World, Z-A will also launch on the original Switch for $60.The Pokemon Switch 2 Bundle has printed artwork on the front and sides of the box. Inside the box, you'll find a voucher to redeem the digital version of Pokemon Legends: Z-A from the Nintendo eShop.

Heads up for new Switch 2 buyers: All physical editions of Switch 2 exclusives include the full game on the card, but most third-party titles utilize Nintendo's Game-Key Cards. These look like regular cartridges, but they are simply unlock keys. You will still need to download the full game if you purchase a Switch 2 physical game marked on the front of the box as a Game-Key Card.The Switch 2's onboard 256GB storage can be filled quickly with AAA third-party titles. Many Switch 2 players will need to expand the console's storage space with microSD Express. You can double your storage with the officially licensed Samsung 256GB microSD Express Card for $59. Alternatively, you can snag the 512GB SanDisk Gameplay microSD Express Card for $78 at Walmart.
