Preorder at Amazon
Fans of Pierce Brown's best-selling dystopian sci-fi series Red Rising can soon add a stunning collector's edition of the first novel to their bookshelf. The Red Rising Deluxe Slipcase Edition releases October 14 and is available to preorder at Amazon for 30% off, which drops the price to only $35 (was $50). This edition is published by Del Rey, the Penguin Random House imprint that has handled the science fiction series since its 2014 debut.The Deluxe Slipcase Edition is one of two exciting Red Rising books hitting stores soon. On September 30, the prequel comic book series Son of Ares launches in a single-volume omnibus edition. The 456-page omnibus is available to preorder for $50 in paperback and $60 in hardcover.
Red Rising Deluxe Slipcase Edition (Hardcover)
$35 (was $50) | Releases October 14
Red Rising's Deluxe Slipcase Edition is one of the most beautiful collectible books I've seen this year. Most deluxe edition hardcovers of popular sci-fi and fantasy novels feature sprayed edges, illustrated endpapers, and perhaps foil-stamped artwork. But Red Rising takes it up a notch with a full-color illustrated slipcase with a quote from the novel on the back of the case. The front and back covers also have exclusive character art set against colorful red and white backgrounds.This edition still has the aforementioned common features found in the deluxe editions: sprayed page edges and illustrated endpapers. For the sprayed edges, the book's designed blended multiple shades of red to create a unique look. Full-color maps of the solar system are included as endpapers. A beautiful fold-out poster depicting the military academy where Darrow and his fellow classmates train. The Mars branch of The Institute is a high-tech fortress resembling a medieval castle. Just like in the book, the isolated school is surrounded by canyons in every direction.The Deluxe Slipcase Edition is 400 pages--slightly longer than the 382-page standard hardcover--and is just a tad bulkier overall at 9.88 x 6.63 x 1.5 inches. Those figures likely include the slipcase, so the actual book is probably about the same size as the standard hardcover (9.5 x 6.38 x 1.25 inches).

Catch up on Pierce's Brown Red Rising Series
The sci-fi series currently has six novels and a graphic novel prequel.
Six novels in the Red Rising series have been published so far. The seventh and final novel, Red God, is expected to hit stores in 2026. The story is set many hundreds of years in the future. In the first novel, Darrow, a lower-class miner in the caste-based society, infiltrates the upper echelons of society and inspires an uprising from within. The series has been compared to The Hunger Games and The Ender Saga. The first three books are narrated solely by Darrow and make up the Red Rising Trilogy. A paperback box set of the Red Rising Trilogy is available for $37.66 (was $54) at Amazon. Books 4-6, known as the Iron Gold Trilogy, are still told from the first-person perspective, but Darrow is one of four narrators. All six books are available in hardcover, paperback, and Kindle ebook formats. The audiobook versions narrated by Tim Gerard Reynolds are very good, too.The Red Rising books could aptly be described as page-turners. They are fast-paced and filled with action, exciting twists, and high-stakes moments. It's worth noting that while the first book is only around 400 pages, some of the Red Rising books are doorstoppers. Iron Gold (Book 5) is the longest at 800 pages, and Light Bringer (Book 6) is over 700 pages. The time investment is worth it, and with no release date set for Red God (Book 7), you have time to catch up.We've listed each Red Rising book in paperback and hardcover below.
