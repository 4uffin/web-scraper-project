After a month of speculation, it turns out that the big monolith up in the mountains on the Fortnite Battle Royale island is, in fact, a teaser for a major new Daft Punk event that starts on Friday, September 27. It's not a live event that you 'll have to show up for at a specific time, but rather an "experience" through which you'll explore Daft Punk's music in an interactive way, similar to the Soundwave Series that Fortnite used to do.Update 11:30 AM PT: For whatever reason, Epic has scrubbed its news post announcing the event as well as related social media posts. It's not clear at all why this has happened, but since they left up their social posts teasing the collab from over the weekend, it's probably not because the event was canceled. It's more likely that the announcement was scheduled for the wrong day or time, or had some major error, but without any comment from Epic we don't really know anything.These are the upcoming Fortnite Daft Punk skins.In addition to the musical experience, the item shop will be adding a Daft Punk bundle on September 25 that includes a pair of skins that include multiple distinctive style options, as well as well as elements that react to music. The set of cosmetics bundled with the skins will also include a double-neck guitar-and-bass instrument, emotes for the songs Around the World and Get Lucky, and a jam track for Get Lucky. And beyond that, we're getting three other Daft Punk jam tracks: Instant Crush ft Julian Casablancas, and The Weeknd's Starboy and I Feel It Coming, which both feature Daft Punk.Gallery
And unlike Fortnite's usual music collabs, this one will heavily involve Lego, as there will be an assortment of Daft Punk-themed Lego sets in the shop as well, including a large pyramid that lights up in time with any music that's playing nearby.In its announcement, Epic emphasized that this event is not a reunion for Daft Punk, which broke up in 2021, but rather a celebration of their massive library of excellent music. So don't expect any new songs from them.Oddly enough, it seems as though The Weeknd will be heavily involved in this event, since he teased it on his Instagram account over the weekend, and two of the new jam tracks this week include his vocal talents. It's possible that The Weeknd could get his fourth Fortnite skin as part of this, but nothing has been announced on that front yet.Fortnite Festival Gorillaz Pass: Skins And RewardsSee More
