As mentioned, Superman's Limited Edition Steelbook has been sold out since shortly after preorders opened. It was priced anywhere from $38 to $51. We'd recommend checking for restocks this week, as it's not uncommon for sold-out Steelbook Editions to pop back up on launch day. The steelbook cover is an an attention-grabber, as it features the entrance to Superman's Fortress of Solitude secret base on the cover, and on the inside, you'll spot the Man of Steel walking through this crystalline ode to his lost homeworld.
