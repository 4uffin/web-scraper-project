Borderlands 4 boss Randy Pitchford is encouraging people to request refunds if they aren't enjoying the newly launched game, and now one publisher known for being cheeky has weighed in and offered up an alternative.Devolver Digital said anyone who gets a refund for Borderlands 4 can spend that money on one of its games, Mycopunk, which launched in July and costs $15. The game bears some stylistic resemblances to Borderlands 4, and, like that game, is also a co-op shooter set on an alien planet.Hey, between you and me - if you do refund Borderlands 4 and "play a different game" please know that Mycopunk is just $15. pic.twitter.com/0Dc7sZFsha

He's involving himself in the discussion about Borderlands 4's PC version, calling people "4K stubborn" and disputing reports of performance issues. In one highly publicized post, Pitchford said, "Please get a refund from Steam if you aren't happy with it."Exactly how many people are getting Borderlands 4 refunds is unknown.
