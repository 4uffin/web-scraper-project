Battlefield 6 will apparently include licensed music, including the Limp Bizkit song "Break Stuff," which was featured in an earlier trailer for the game. That song, of course, is fitting for the Battlefield universe given the games are all about breaking stuff.Some of the other songs to be featured in Battlefield 6 include "Bodies" by Drowning Pool, "Awake" by Godsmack," and "Can't Stop" by the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Bob Dylan's "Master of War" is said to be included as well, along with "Nuthin But A G Thang" by Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg.Battlefield Bulletin discovered the track list. The tunes will appear as in-game vehicle audio.Battlefield 6 track list"Awake" - Godsmack"Bodies" - Drowning Pool"Break Stuff" - Limp Bizkit"Can't Stop" - Red Hot Chili Peppers"Domination" - Pantera"Got Each Other" - The Interrupters ft.
