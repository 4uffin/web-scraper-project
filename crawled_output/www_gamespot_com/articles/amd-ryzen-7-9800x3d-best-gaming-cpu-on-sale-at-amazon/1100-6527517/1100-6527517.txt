The best processor for PC gaming is on sale for $49 off at Amazon. The AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D is up for grabs for $430 (was $479). Amazon doesn't list an end date for the discount, but considering the popularity of the high-performing 3D V-Cache CPU, it probably won't be available to purchase for $430 for long. The 9800X3D has been one of the best-selling CPUs on Amazon since its release last November. It has earned top-notch reviews from critics and customers alike.Amazon estimates orders placed today (September 22) will arrive anywhere from two weeks to a month from now.

The Ryzen 7 9800X3D is one of the newest in the burgeoning line of 3D V-Cache CPUs, with each one proving to be an essential part of an enthusiast-gaming PC. It was the first to feature AMD's 2nd-generation 3D V-Cache technology, with AMD saying that the 9800X3D is, on average, 8% faster than the previous generation's 7800X3D, which itself was widely viewed as the best CPU on the market for gaming. The 9800X3D has a base clock speed of 4.7GHz, with a boost to 5.2GHz and a TDP of 120W. It was the first X3D chip with overclocking, allowing enthusiasts to squeeze even more out of the silicon with meaningful tweaks. The processing cores were redesigned using AMD's Zen 5 architecture. In addition to top-notch gaming performance, the 8-core, 16-thread CPU offers a marked improvement in productivity performance.

The 9800X3D is the fastest gaming CPU on the market today. Earlier this year, AMD released a pair of Ryzen 9 3D V-Cache CPUs that have similarly robust specs, just with more of a productivity focus over gaming. The Ryzen 9 9900X3D is available for $588 at Amazon, while the more popular 9950X3D is priced at $664 (was $699). But if you're looking for a gaming processor for a high-end rig, the 9800X3D is the best option on the AMD side.At the moment, the 9800X3D is slotted in the No. 2 spot on the Amazon's best seller chart for CPUs. The only processor ahead of it is the aforementioned AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D, which is still a very good processor for gaming more than two years after its release. You can get the Ryzen 7 7800X3D for $358.49 (was $449) at Amazon.Sign up for GameSpot's Weekly Deals Newsletter: The Best PC Games To Play In 2025See More
