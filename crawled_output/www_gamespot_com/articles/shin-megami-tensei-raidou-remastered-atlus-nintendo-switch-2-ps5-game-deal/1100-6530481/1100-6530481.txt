Raidou Remastered: The Mystery of the Soulless Army is part of Atlus' Shin Megami Tensei series. More specifically, it's part of the Devil Summoner subseries, which is also home to the 2022 RPG Soul Hackers 2. Raidou Remastered originally released in 2006 on PS2 as Devil Summoner: Raidou Kuzunoha vs. the Soulless Army.The remaster earned largely positive reviews at launch and has been well-received by fans, too. At the time of writing, Raidou Remastered has a "Very Positive" Steam user review average based on 687 reviews.Amazon's store page still refers to Raidou Remastered as the "Launch Edition," so you might find a voucher for the early purchase bonus in the box (Raidou Glasses cosmetic item).

It's worth noting that Raidou Remastered's physical edition on Switch 2 is a Game-Key Card, so an eShop download for the game will begin when you first insert the cartridge. Raidou Remastered's Switch 2 file size is 12.7GB.The majority of Switch 2 third-party games use the controversial Game-Key Cards, including the upcoming port of Persona 3 Reload.Since you are effectively buying digital copies of games with vanity cartridges, regular Switch 2 users could run out of storage space faster than they might expect. You can expand your Switch 2 storage space with a microSD Express Card. The officially licensed Samsung 256GB model is a good choice for $59, but you can also get a 512GB SanDisk Gameplay microSD Express for only $78 at Walmart.

While Raidou Remastered: The Mystery of the Soulless Army drops the Shin Megami Tensei and Devil Summoner nomenclature from its title, the game still takes place within the series. It follows Raidou Kuzonoha--who fans may recognize from his appearances in other MegaTen games like Shin Megami Tensei III and Soul Hackers--an apprentice occult investigator and Devil Summoner who allies with demons to solve various mysteries in 1930s Tokyo and the mysterious Dark Realm.Unlike other games in the MegaTen series, Raidou Remastered is an action-RPG featuring real-time combat where players combo attacks as Raidou and leverage the powers of over 120 recruitable demons. Interestingly, the remaster retools the game to use the combat system of the original game's sequel, Devil Summoner 2: Raidou Kuzunoha vs. King Abaddon--though the sequel is not included in this remaster. Along with the new combat system, the remaster has revamped visuals, new voice acting, an all-new interface, expanded environments, and numerous quality-of-life changes.Disclosure: GameSpot and Fanatical are both owned by Fandom.More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals & Preorders
