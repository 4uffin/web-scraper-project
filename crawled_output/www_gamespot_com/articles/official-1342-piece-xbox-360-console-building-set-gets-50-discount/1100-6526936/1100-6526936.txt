Along with the console itself, you'll build a detachable hard drive, Xbox 360 controller, and Halo 3 game box. You can actually place the fake Halo 3 disc on the disc reader by popping off the side panel. With the disc loaded, the Cortana chip on the motherboard lights up. The Xbox Guide button also illuminates with a removable battery pack.The power button on the front of the console lights up as well, but thankfully you don't have to worry about seeing the infamous Red Ring of Death.
