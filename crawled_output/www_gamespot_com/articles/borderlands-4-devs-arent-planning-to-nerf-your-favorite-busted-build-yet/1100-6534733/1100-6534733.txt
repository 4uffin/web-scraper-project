Borderlands 4 places a bigger emphasis on buildcrafting the perfect Vault Hunter, and as many players have discovered, there's plenty of potential to create some truly broken builds in the game. This has led to some fears about an imminent nerf coming--especially to Vex, the witchy Siren who is capable of dishing out some truly ludicrous damage--but Gearbox says it won't "knee-jerk react" to what it sees from the Borderlands fandom, unless it poses a risk to the stability of the game."Chill guys, we're not going to knee-jerk react to anything," Borderlands 4 creative director Graame Timmins wrote on X/Twitter, in response to a video showing off how quickly Vex can melt a boss down to scrap metal with the right gear and skills equipped. "That said, this looks like a bug we fixed with Harlow and Rafa prior to launch that could recursively cause damage it and actually crashed the game and/or froze the UI. Going to investigate, could be legit stability problem."

Now Playing: Borderlands 4 Video Review
With action-RPGs, it's not uncommon for players to discover character builds that do a little too much damage than initially intended. For example, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 players leveraged the power of the Stendhal build to wipe the floor with enemies until developer Sandfall Interactive toned down the damage, and Bungie has nerfed numerous Guardian builds over the years, much to the annoyance of the game's fanbase. Borderlands has often been an exception to that school of thought, as players have discovered killer combos between weapons, gear, and skills that have helped them overcome tough fights. These have rarely been patched, as additional difficulty modes have helped keep players on their toes instead.Borderlands 4 is out right now for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, and while the game has reached an impressive number of concurrent players on Steam, it has also been slammed with negative user reviews. The game's performance on PC has been heavily criticized alongside Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford's response to various complaints.If you're planning to play through the performance and optimization issues, you can check out our Borderlands 4 guides hub for several helpful features, as well as our updated list of Shift Codes so that you can quickly power up your arsenal.How To Unlock Vaults In Borderlands 4See More
