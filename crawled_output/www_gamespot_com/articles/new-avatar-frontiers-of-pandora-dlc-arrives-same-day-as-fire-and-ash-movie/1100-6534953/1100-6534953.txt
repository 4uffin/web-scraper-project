Now Playing: Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora Review
Creative director Omar Bouali told IGN that From the Ashes takes place "a few weeks" after the upcoming Fire and Ash film and "roughly six months" after the events of Frontiers of Pandora and its two previous story expansions (The Sky Breaker and Secrets of the Spires)."From the Ashes is set in a ravaged and occupied version of the Kinglor Forest which includes a new sub-region, The Ravines," Bouali said. "It mirrors the themes of the film as it sees the RDA ally with the Ash Clan, fierce Na’vi warriors who thrive on chaos and pain as they intensify their efforts to eliminate threats to their regime. So, whilst the film and expansion are set in different regions of Pandora, there is some shared DNA and we've worked closely with Lightstorm to ensure both pieces of Avatar media are [complementary]."Keeping his cards close to his chest and choosing his words carefully, Bouali gave a brief hint of what to expect when From the Ashes comes out this December. Apparently, there's a connection between this upcoming story expansion and the upcoming theatrical release."We have been able to share some elements across both pieces of media--the most obvious being the Mangkawn, otherwise known as the Ash Clan, but also the Wind Traders who appeared first in our game but will also appear in Fire and Ash," Bouali said. "There’s also one very special creature that will appear in both our game and Fire and Ash that we’re very excited for fans to discover. So yes, without revealing too much, it is a process of strong collaboration and we each have been able to share and contribute in an organic, complementary way to ensure fans get an authentic and consistent experience across both the expansion and film."This isn't the only thing coming to Frontiers of Pandora. On December 5, two weeks before From the Ashes and Fire and Ash come out, Ubisoft Massive will release an update for the open-world action-adventure game that introduces New Game Plus, as well as a third-person camera for a different perspective.From the Ashes will be available for $20 USD on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Ubisoft+, and PC via Steam, Epic Games Store, and Ubisoft Connect. There's also a $40 USD From the Ashes Edition, which includes the base Frontiers of Pandora game and this story DLC.Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is available now on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.Avatar: Fire And Ash Release Date, Cast, Director, And Everything Else To KnowSee More
