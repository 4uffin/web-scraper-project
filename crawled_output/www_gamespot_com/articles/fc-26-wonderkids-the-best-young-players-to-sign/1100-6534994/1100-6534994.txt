Starting a new Career Mode in EA Sports FC 26? Then you’re probably eyeing up the transfer market, scouting for future stars to build your squad around. While the board might give you a period of grace to begin with, the pressure to perform kicks in fast. That’s where the best FC 26 wonderkids come in--sign the right ones early, and you’ll set yourself up for success.While you can still have a successful season without wonderkids, they’ll certainly help things along. These youngsters have the potential to become world-beaters, and while some are already at big clubs, others are waiting in the wings, desperate for their big break.What are FC 26 wonderkids?Wonderkids are talented youngsters who have plenty of potential in their chosen position. With the right facilities and training, you can turn a teenager into a household name, making some easy profit for yourself along the way.To help you sign the best players, we’ve highlighted the top 10 youngsters (ages 15-21) in each main position. You’ll have heard of some names, like Yamal, Agyemang, and Endrick, but there’ll be a few unknowns that’ll surprise you and your transfer budget.Best young players in FC 26 overallThese are the players with the highest potential overall in EA Sports FC 26. Unsurprisingly, Yamal takes the crown, but there’s plenty of talent set to challenge him in the coming years.PlayerClubAgePositionOverallPotentialGenderLamine YamalFC Barcelona18RM, RW8995MaleLinda CaicedoReal Madrid20LW, LM8591FemaleEndrickReal Madrid19ST7791MaleDesire DouePSG20RW, LW, RM8591MaleGuilia DragoniRoma18CM, CAM7190FemaleJoao NevesPSG20CM, CDM8590MaleEstevaoChelsea18RM, RW7889MaleJorthy MokioAjax17CDM, CM7089MaleSydney SchertenleibFC Barcelona18CAM, CM7489FemaleMichelle AgyemangBrighton & Hove Albion19ST7689FemaleBest young strikers in FC 26If you’re looking for a deadly threat to fill your striker role, look no further than these talented strikers. Endrick will be the most expensive choice here, but Camarda would be a great option for a team looking to bolster their promotion chances.If you’re looking for greener strikers with growth potential of up to 25, we’d recommend Igor Tyjon, Ranneke Derks, and Jonah Kusi-Asare.PlayerClubAgePositionOverallPotentialGenderEndrickReal Madrid19ST7791MaleMichelle AgyemangBrighton & Hove Albion19ST7689FemaleFrancesco CamardaLecce17ST6587MaleSamuFC Porto21ST7986MaleMathys TelTottenham Hotspur20ST7786MaleYoan BonnyLombardia FC21ST7686MaleJhon DuranFenerbahce21ST7986MaleBo van EgmondAjax18ST6585FemaleEli Junior KroupiAFC Bournemouth19ST7485MaleConrad HarderRB Leipzig20ST7485MaleBest young wingers in FC 26The wonderkid wingers are certainly a talented bunch, but they’re also pretty pricey. If you’re looking to spin a profit at the next transfer market, consider picking up someone like Ngumoha.If you’re looking for a cheaper option, consider Amiani Tatu, Franciszek Franczak, or Predro Villalba -- all 17-year-old stars with the potential of hitting 82 OVR.PlayerClubAgePositionOverallPotentialGenderLamine YamalFC Barcelona18RM, RW8995MaleLinda CaicedoReal Madrid20LW, LM8591FemaleDesire DouePSG20RW, LW, RM8591MaleEstevaoChelsea18RM, RW7889MaleArda GulerReal Madrid20RM, RW8189MaleRio NgumohaLiverpool17LW, LM6888MaleGeovany QuendaSporting CP18RM, LM, LW, RW7688MaleAntonio NusaRB Leipzig20LW, LM7688MalePablo GarciaReal Betis Balompie19RM, LM, RW6887MAleAlara SehitlerBayern Munich18RM, RW7387FemaleLoreen BenderBayer 04 Leverkusen20RM, RW7387FemaleAoba FujinoManchester City21RM, RW7787FemaleBest young midfielders in FC 26There’s plenty to choose from in the midfielders category. Serrajordi is a favourite of mine--and would be the perfect option for anyone embarking on a women's coaching journey.Lawrence Wong and Pablo Agudin would also be good options. The 17-year-olds have the potential to turn into 81 and 82-rated players.PlayerClubAgePositionOverallPotentialGenderGuilia DragoniRoma18CM, CAM7190FemaleJoao NevesPSG20CM, CDM8590MaleJorthy MokioAjax17CDM, CM7089MaleSydney SchertenleibFC Barcelona18CAM, CM7489FemaleKenan YildizJuventus20CAM, CM7989MaleNico PazComo21CAM, CM7989MaleGaviFC Barcelona21CM, CAM8389MaleRodrigo MoraFC Porta18CAM, CM7689MaleClara SerrajordiFC Barcelona17CM, CAM, CDM6588FemaleJauregizarAthletic Club de Bilbao21CM, CDM7888MaleBest young centre backs in FC 26Our centre back options are pushing on in age, but they’re solid options for your defensive line.
