Fanatical is running the aptly named September Savers event right now, giving you a chance to save on hundreds of PC games--including new and upcoming releases like Silent Hill f, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, and more. During the event, Fanatical is also giving away September Savers Scratchcards when you spend $15 or more on a single order. These virtual scratchcards include bonus items like a free game key or a discount coupon. These are limited to three per customer during the event. Along with the scratchcards, all orders also include a 5% off voucher code usable on your next Fanatical purchase. See all deals at Fanatical If you're looking for some meaty RPGs to play in the coming Fall and Winter months, you're in luck, as several of the best recent games in the genre are part of the sale. This includes Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, which is down to $40 (was $50). The RPG is one of the frontrunners for 2025's Game of the Year thanks to its deep storyline and engaging turn-based battle system that incorporates real-time action elements like dodges and parries. It's an easy recommendation at full price, so this price cut makes it a no-brainer. A similar pick would be GameSpot's 2024 Game of the Year, Metaphor: ReFantazio, which is a superb turn-based RPG from Atlus that takes aspects of the Persona and Shin Megami Tensei series into a new high fantasy setting. It's on sale for $35 (was $70).If you're looking for an RPG that favors crunchy gameplay systems over story, Dragon's Dogma 2 is an excellent choice while it's on sale for $24.84 (was $70). Capcom's open-world action RPG was another of our favorite games last year, earning a 9/10 for its rewarding exploration and emergent sandbox design, as well as the ways it melds old-school RPG design with fast-paced action combat.Another of Capcom's recent action RPG releases, Monster Hunter Wilds, is on sale for $47.24 (was $70). While the game's post-launch discourse has been divisive due to its lingering performance hiccups and more streamlined gameplay that some players find too easy, it's nevertheless a fun new entry in the long-running series that's perfect for new players or anyone seeking a meaty game to grind through in co-op. Other Monster Hunter deals include Monster Hunter Stories Collection - Deluxe Edition for $29.74 (was $70) and Monster Hunter Rise + Sunbreak - Deluxe Edition for $16.79 (was $70).Speaking of online co-op, Fallout 76 is down to $8.79 (was $40). While it didn't earn the best reviews at launch, constant updates and patches have pushed the large-scale multiplayer RPG closer to what fans would expect from single-player entries in the Bethesda-era Fallout series.Some other big discounts in the sale include Saints Row - Gold Edition for $8 (was $40) or Batman: Arkham Collection for $7.49 (was $60). Saints Row - Gold Edition is an open-world crime game that should make the wait for GTA VI a bit easier, while the Batman: Arkham Collection bundles Batman: Arkham Asylum and its sequels, Arkham City and Arkham Knight, together into a single package.Plenty of other great PC games are on sale during the Fanatical September Savers Event; we've compiled a list of some of our favorites below, or you can browse the full sale at Fanatical.
