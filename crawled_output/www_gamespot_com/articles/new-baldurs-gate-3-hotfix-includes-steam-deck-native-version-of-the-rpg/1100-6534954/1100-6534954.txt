Baldur's Gate 3 is apparently even better to play on the go now, as Larian Studios has released a new native version of the RPG for Steam Deck as part of a hotfix update. The developer states that the game has "a more stable frame rate, lower loading times, and smoother gameplay" on the PC handheld. Larian detailed what's included with hotfix 34 on Steam in a set of patch notes, with the spotlight on the Steam Deck-native build. But the developer pointed out this new portable version of Baldur's Gate 3 has led to "overall improvements to the way game models are streamed on all platforms, which should reduce framerate spikes in busy areas, such as the Lower City in Act 3." Previously, the RPG utilized the "Proton compatibility layer, which requires extra CPU processing power," to run on Valve's handheld.Hotfix #34 is now live! You'll no longer turn into a floating torso when talking with Ketheric’s dog, the Apostle of Myrkul will stop regaining hit points when you load a save mid-combat, and we've attempted to save you from some annoying crashes.

Mods can carry over to the native Steam Deck build of Baldur's Gate 3. Larian stated that by logging "in to your Larian Account and hav[ing] it connected to mod.io" will lead to your mods downloading for the game. Meanwhile, hotfix 34 also addresses other issues for Baldur's Gate 3, like crashing instances on Xbox Series X|S.Last month, Baldur's Gate 3 celebrated its second anniversary with a lot of fun player stats. For instance, there have been more than 265 million mod downloads for the game and 1.1 million players finished the RPG in Tactician mode. Earlier this year, Baldur's Gate 3 got a beefy update that introduced cross-play and 12 new subclasses.For more, check out GameSpot's Baldur's Gate 3 review.
