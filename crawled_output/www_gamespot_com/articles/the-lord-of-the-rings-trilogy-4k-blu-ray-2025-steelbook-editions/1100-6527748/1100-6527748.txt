The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King's upcoming standalone 4K Blu-ray edition is available to preorder at Amazon and Walmart for $30 (was $35). Amazon's price started at $35 before rocketing to $53, but now the retailer is matching Walmart's deal. The Return of the King will join the existing 4K Steelbooks for The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers, both of which released earlier this year and are also discounted to $30 each. With current deal prices at both retailers, fans of Peter Jackson's superb adaptation can own matching collectible editions of the full trilogy for only $90.The Lord of the Rings Trilogy on 4K Blu-ray - Limited Edition SteelbookThe Lord of the Rings Trilogy Limited Edition Steelbooks on 4K Blu-rayThe Fellowship of the Ring Steelbook (4K, Digital)See at Amazon -- $30 ($35)See at Walmart -- $30 ($35)The Two Towers Steelbook (4K, Digital)See at Amazon -- $30 ($35)See at Walmart -- $30 ($35)The Return of the King Steelbook (4K, Digital) | October 14Preorder at Amazon -- $30 ($35)Preorder at Walmart -- $30 ($35)Securing these beautiful Steelbook Editions of The Lord of the Rings Trilogy for only $90 from Walmart or Amazon is quite the deal. Especially when you consider these editions were previously only available in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy Steelbook Collection with a $170 MSRP. The box set also comes with a metal display box, so you're missing out on that by purchasing the movies individually. The slipcase probably isn't worth paying double for most fans, though. Unlike the box set, the standalone editions include digital versions of the movies for your Movies Anywhere library.

If you haven't watched The Lord of the Rings on 4K Blu-ray, all three films (and The Hobbit Trilogy) look and sound beautiful. Along with upscaled 4K visuals, The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and The Return of the King support Dolby Vision and HDR10 on compatible displays. The audio experience can be enhanced with Dolby Atmos or Dolby TrueHD 7.1 surround sound.These are the only standalone 4K Blu-ray editions of The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers in North America. Jackson's Tolkien adaptations are typically printed as trilogy box sets on 4K Blu-ray and/or Blu-ray.Although the new Steelbook Editions offer a budget-friendly way to get collectible versions of Peter Jackson's excellent adaptations of J.R.R. Tolkien's fantasy classic, there are still cheaper ways to buy the films on 4K.

Published last October with a staggering $325 price tag, this expanded edition of the beloved 1992 three-volume collection includes stunning hardcover editions of each part of LOTR accompanied by dozens of drawings and paintings by Alan Lee. More than 50 of the illustrations are new to the remastered edition.Quarterbound leather and cloth board bindings make these editions feel and look quite beautiful. The covers have original artwork by Lee in the center, and all of the symbols and lettering on the front and spines are foil-stamped in silver. Each book has sprayed top and bottom edges as well as illustrated side edges. Those illustrations match Lee's Mount Doom artwork found on the interior walls of the custom-designed cloth board slipcase. This handsome box set also comes with three art cards and two foldout maps created by Christopher Tolkien.Before you pick up the Deluxe set, you'll also want to take a look at the upcoming four-book hardcover set that includes The Hobbit. Like the Deluxe editions, these hardcovers are the editions with illustrations by Alan Lee. The covers and display case are fully illustrated, so this set has a decidedly different look.
