What's in the Black Ops 7 beta?On September 22, Activision released a new Black Ops 7 multiplayer trailer and confirmed which maps and modes will be in the beta. The details follow below.Black Ops 7 beta mapsBlackheartCortexExposureImprintThe ForgeToshinBlack Ops 7 beta modesOverloadTeam DeathmatchDominationKill ConfirmedHardpointTraining CourseThe new Black Ops 7 mode, Overload.ZombiesIn addition to head-to-head multiplayer, the Black Ops 7 beta will include Zombies Survival on the Vandorn Farm map.Anti-cheatFor the PC edition of Black Ops 7 (beta and full release), players will need both TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot to play. "These protections make it harder for bad actors to load cheats before our gameplay begins. These new features, alongside our upcoming updates, raise the bar for security in PC gaming and give a stronger foundation to build on when Black Ops 7 officially launches on November 14th," Activision said. These may already be enabled on your computer, but if not, you can follow our guide on how to enable Secure Boot to ensure you don't run into any issues with this (or Battlefield 6, which also requires it).Black Ops 7 takes place in the year 2035 and will feature futuristic weapons and gear. New for Black Ops 7 is a multiplayer mode called Skirmish, which is a 20v20 mode feature multiple objectives. Also in this mode players can use wingsuits and grappling hooks, along with vehicles in what's described as a large-scale mode. Additionally, Black Ops 7 has a new "Overlock" system that allows players to further augment their loadouts.Additionally, the Omnimovement system from Black Ops 6 is back in Black Ops 7, and it's beefed up with a wall-jumping ability. Black Ops 7 will have 18 maps at launch along with 30 weapons.
