Battlefield 6 got a new trailer during the PlayStation State of Play, providing a new look at the single-player campaign. The campaign follows Dagger 13, a squad of Marine Raiders, fighting against Pax Armata, a tech-focused private military organization that is trying to establish itself as a global power following the fall of NATO. The trailer starts with a brief cinematic, showing Dagger 13 performing a synced attack. The rest of the trailer focuses on a mix of gameplay and small bits of cutscenes. Gameplay sections include exploring a bombed out Brooklyn, HALO jumping from a plane, and even storming a Gibraltar beach.These sections highlight both the grand scale of Battlefield 6 and the destructibility, with buildings in the distance getting completely leveled, and the walls of a building getting blown out as the player runs through it. To really drive home the massive scale of combat and destruction in Battlefield 6, the trailer also features tons of explosions. We see small explosives blowing open walls, collapsing hallways, firing RPGs into buildings, and even bombing runs on military facilities.EA is planning on sharing even more about Battlefield 6's campaign ahead of launch, with a Tokyo Game Show panel dedicated to providing more details. In the meantime, you can read our new Battlefield 6 campaign hands-on preview.Battlefield 6 launches on October 10 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.
