Annapurna Interactive went to Tokyo Game Show with three game reveals ready to go, and the results of its three-pronged showcase have resulted in an eclectic slate of upcoming games the company will be publishing. The team showed off a new puzzler in a strangely cozy dystopia, a turn-based RPG that's also part musical, and perhaps most interesting of them all, a game that looks quite like a Legend of Zelda sequel. Here's what you need to know about all three.D-topia D-Topia is described as a puzzle game in which you play the role of a "Facilitator" working at the D-topia residential facility. There, you'll address concerns of the residents while uncovering a secret at the heart of the AI-run society. The "perfectly happy world" that the game is set in seems to be nothing more than a facade, and it's up to you to expose the reality of the situation. D-topia is developed by Marumittu Games and it's coming to PC, Switch, Switch 2, PlayStation 5, and Xbox in 2026.People of Note People of Note is one part musical, one part turn-based RPG. Basically, it's the dream game for GameSpot's Jordan Ramee. Both the story and the game's combat mechanics lean into the musical aspect of the experience, giving players a big cast of characters who can belt out solos and beat down rivals. People of Note comes from Iridium Studios in 2026 for PC, Xbox, and PS5.Demi and the Fractured Dream This is the one Zelda fans ought to circle on their calendars (if people still kept physical calendars, anyway). Demi and the Fractured Dream stars its titular hero, Demi, in a world called Somnus. Demi's quest has him chasing a means of escaping his "cursed fate" and is an ode to classic action-adventure games, with its hack-and-slash combat, environment puzzling, and an emphasis on its story and world. From the team at Yarn Owl, Demi hits PC, Switch, Switch 2, Xbox, and PS5 in 2026.This was Annapurna's first time bringing news to Tokyo Game Show, but not nearly the first time it's revealed games I quickly wishlisted.
