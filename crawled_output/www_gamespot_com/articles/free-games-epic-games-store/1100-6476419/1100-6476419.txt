The Epic Games Store continues to give away a free game each week, and this week is another nice find with a price that can't be beaten. Every Thursday at 8 AM PT / 11 AM ET, Epic offers at least one free PC game (and sometimes even as many as two or three). All you need to do to claim the free games is create a free Epic account and enable two-factor authentication. You have a week to add the freebies to your library before the new one(s) take their place. At this point, Epic has given away hundreds of free games, and there's no sign that the program will stop any time soon. The company has also extended its freebies to Android devices, and you can claim a free game every week here as well. We keep this article up to date weekly to highlight both the current free games and next week's offerings.If you're looking for more freebies, you can check out our list of the 25 best free PC games to play in 2025, or for more options, the 25 best free games to play in 2025 on multiple platforms.Current free games at EpicProject Winter This week, you can grab Project Winter and Samorost 2 for free. Project Winter is a survival game with a twist, as your group will have to gather resources, repair structures, and brave the wilderness while keeping an eye out for any potential traitors who'll sabotage your efforts. Samorost 2 is an old-school point-and-click adventure game, and it tells a surreal story of a space gnome looking to rescue his dog from mischievous aliens. See all free games at Epic Next free games at EpicEastern Exorcist Next week, you can get Eastern Exorcist and Jorelâ€™s Brother and The Most Important Game of the Galaxy for free. Eastern Exorcist is a 2D side-scrolling action-RPG where you eliminate vicious spirits and monsters, and it features a hand-drawn Chinese ink painting style. Joel's Brother--I'm not rewriting the entire title--isn't a game about Superman's uncle but it is an old-school point-and-click adventure about an eight-year-old boy who lives with his eccentric family and is constantly overshadowed by his older brother.Epic Games Store free games listWe're keeping a running list of every free game that Epic users have been able to claim in the past. From AAA hits to indie darlings, Epic has really made its mark with free games. You can even snag these games if you don't have a powerful PC so you can play them if you ever get one. Look at the list below to see the frankly ridiculous list of free games that have been available.GameDateJorel's BrotherSeptember 25 - October 2, 2025Eastern ExorcistSeptember 25 - October 2,
