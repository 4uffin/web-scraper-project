The Epic Games Store continues to give away a free game each week, and this week is another nice find with a price that can't be beaten. Every Thursday at 8 AM PT / 11 AM ET, Epic offers at least one free PC game (and sometimes even as many as two or three). All you need to do to claim the free games is create a free Epic account and enable two-factor authentication. You have a week to add the freebies to your library before the new one(s) take their place. At this point, Epic has given away hundreds of free games, and there's no sign that the program will stop any time soon. The company has also extended its freebies to Android devices, and you can claim a free game every week here as well. We keep this article up to date weekly to highlight both the current free games and next week's offerings.If you're looking for more freebies, you can check out our list of the 25 best free PC games to play in 2025, or for more options, the 25 best free games to play in 2025 on multiple platforms.Current free games at EpicGhostrunner 2This week, you can get Ghostrunner 2, Monument Valley 2, and The Battle of Polytopia for free. If you never grabbed Ghostrunner 2 when it was given away for free on EGS in December 2024, then you missed out on a slick first-person hack-and-slasher set in a cyberpunk world. Its developer is currently working on a souls-like first-person game called Valor Mortis. The Battle of Polytopia is a turn-based strategy game set in a strange--and very flat--world, and it features both single-player and multiplayer modes.

Project Winter is a survival game with a twist, as your group will have to gather resources, repair structures, and brave the wilderness while keeping an eye out for any potential traitors who'll sabotage your efforts. Samorost 2 is an old-school point-and-click adventure game, and it tells a surreal story of a space gnome looking to rescue his dog from mischievous aliens.Epic Games Store free games listWe're keeping a running list of every free game that Epic users have been able to claim in the past. From AAA hits to indie darlings, Epic has really made its mark with free games. You can even snag these games if you don't have a powerful PC so you can play them if you ever get one. Look at the list below to see the frankly ridiculous list of free games that have been available.GameDateSamorost 2September 18-25, 2025Project WinterSeptember 18-25, 2025Monument Valley 2September
