$100 (was $544)
See at Stack Social
If you're looking to turn your PC into a dedicated home office, Adobe Acrobat Classic and Microsoft Office Pro are necessities. However, they're typically quite expensive, with the duo costing upwards of $500 for the standalone licenses, or steep recurring prices for the subscription versions. Luckily, you can pick up Adobe Acrobat and Microsoft Office Professional License for just $100 total (normally $543)--that's an 81% discount--via a limited-time bundle deal from Stack Social.
Adobe Acrobat Classic + Microsoft Office Professional License Bundle
$100 (was $544)
This bundle includes a 3-year license for Adobe Acrobat Classic PDF Software (also known as Adobe Acrobat Pro 2024), which lets you create and modify PDF files, sign electronic documents, and more. It also includes Microsoft Office Pro 2021, which gets you the full suite of Microsoft Office productivity software, including MS Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams, OneNote, Publisher, and Access.

For reference, here's a full list of the included software:Adobe Acrobat + MS Office BundleAdobe Acrobat Pro 2024 (3-Year)Microsoft Office Word (Lifetime; single device)Microsoft Office Excel (Lifetime; single device)Microsoft Office PowerPoint (Lifetime; single device)Microsoft Office Outlook (Lifetime; single device)Microsoft Office Teams (Free version)Microsoft Office OneNote (Lifetime; single device)Microsoft Office Publisher (Lifetime; single device)Microsoft Office Access (Lifetime; single device)There are a few caveats to this deal. For one, the Microsoft Office Pro 2021 license is a one-time purchase that can only be used on one PC. It's tied to your actual device--not your Microsoft account--so if you decide to upgrade your laptop or PC, you'll need a new license. As for Acrobat Classic, it's only a three-year license available to US customers, and premium features aren't available through web browsers or mobile devices.Despite a few quirks, this is still a great deal for anyone who isn't interested in signing up for Adobe or Microsoft's monthly subscriptions.A few other deals are available at StackSocial right now, including a standalone Microsoft Office Professional 2021 Lifetime License for just $40 (was $220) and AdGuard VPN (5-Year Subscription) for $40 (was $359.40). The latter might not be the most popular VPN on the planet, but it features over 60 server locations, allows for up to 10 devices to connect simultaneously, and works across both mobile and desktop.Sign up for GameSpot's Weekly Deals Newsletter: More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals & Preorders
