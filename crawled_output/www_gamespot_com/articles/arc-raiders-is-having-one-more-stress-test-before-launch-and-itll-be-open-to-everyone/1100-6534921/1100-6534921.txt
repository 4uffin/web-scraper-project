Despite saying that it wasn't planning to have any more playtests for Arc Raiders, it looks like developer Embark Studios is ready to recruit people for one more weekend of action in its extraction shooter. The studio will host a Server Slam Open Test from October 17-19 on PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, and it's aiming to stress-test its servers before the game officially launches later this month.This open weekend will allow players to explore the Dam Battlegrounds and experience "elements of progression and crafting" while completing a set of quests, Embark Studios said. One thing to note here is that progress will not carry over from the Slam Test, but participating players will unlock an exclusive backpack cosmetic for the full game.This will be open to everyone aged 16 and older, so you won't need a download key or an invite to get an early taste of Arc Raiders.The exclusive backpack that can be unlocked by participating in the stress test. Earlier this year, it looked like there'd be a showdown between extraction shooters as Arc Raiders was scheduled to launch in close proximity to Bungie's Marathon. Following claims of art theft, Marathon was delayed indefinitely from its planned release date of September 23. One thing to note about Arc Raiders is that it will not be a free-to-play game, as the PvPvE extraction shooter will cost $40 when it launches on October 30.It's also arriving during a busy month in the gaming calendar, as it'll be released shortly after The Outer Worlds 2, Dragon Quest 1 & 2 HD-2D Remake, Ninja Gaiden 4, and Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2.The Best PC Games To Play In 2025See More
