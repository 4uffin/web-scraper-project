Developer Gearbox has revealed that Borderlands 4 players can pick up two legendary weapons by watching the looter-shooter on Twitch. To start, the Midnight Defiance sniper rifle will be available by viewing two hours of partnered creators playing the game from now through September 30.Players can also claim a legendary shotgun called the Forsaken Chaos by viewing two hours of the game via the Borderlands 4 category on Twitch (just make sure Drops are enabled). Gearbox notes on the Borderlands website that Midnight Defiance and Forsaken Chaos can't be earned at the same time, so collectively a person would need to watch four hours of the game to obtain both legendary weapons.The Midnight Defiance legendary sniper rifle will be available as a Twitch Drop for Borderlands 4 from now through September 30. If watching hours of Borderlands 4 sounds like a bit too much, you can also grab a "Watch, Drop, and Roll" ECHO-4 Drone Skin by viewing 20 minutes of the game on either the official Borderlands 4 Twitch channel or Gearbox Twitch channel. This skin will be available through September 26.The Borderlands 4 gear you receive from Twitch Drops "will scale to whatever level your Vault Hunter is" at the time of claiming them, per Gearbox. However, there is a minimum set at level 5. As such, it might be worth waiting until processing further into the game before claiming them from your Twitch inventory. This way the gear is usable at higher levels.How to claim Twitch Drops in Borderlands 4Watch the necessary amount of time of a Drops-enabled stream on TwitchClick "claim" next to each one on your Twitch Drops inventory page.
