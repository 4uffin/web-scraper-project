If you want to hook up with your friends in Roblox, you no longer need to use third-party software such as Discord. This is because the Roblox Corporation released a dedicated Party feature that allows you and your friends to join the same experience, even if you play on different devices.Hosting a Roblox Party is relatively straightforward, and joining one is even simpler. Right now, there are a few restrictions on who can use the feature in an effort to keep Roblox safe for all players. There are also benefits to joining a Party within some of the best Roblox games too, so below we’ll go over everything you need to know to keep the fun entertaining, while also keeping you safe.Table of Contents [hide]How to start or join a Roblox PartyHow to keep your Roblox Party safe How to disable Party ChatBest Roblox games to play with friends Eventually, you'll be able to chat with your voice along with your close friends. For now, it's just text chat.How to start or join a Roblox PartyTo start a party, open Roblox on either the PC or mobile app, and go to the Party tab. From there, you can click the plus sign to add users in your friends list to your group. Once you’ve finalized adding the people you want to invite, click or tap the Join button to send the invitation. After everyone arrives, you have the option to pick an experience for you all to play and send invites for them within the Party screen to join your game. Even when you’re offline, the party will still be available for the next time you play.If you want to add a user to a party you’ve already created, go to the group you wish to edit and click the three dots on the top right of your screen. You can then select “Add Connections” and search for the player’s username, finally clicking “Add” to include them in the group.Those who are waiting to join a party should first ensure that they’re on the host’s friends list. If so, you’ll receive a notification either through the app or via mobile push notifications. You can also open the Party tab to see any active parties. Tap on the host’s party or notification and click “Join” to get into the group.There are a few limitations for you to keep in mind. The first is that only players over the age of 13, or a parent or caregiver, can create a party. Those using parental controls can restrict party access entirely or limit it to one-on-one access only, such as you playing a game with your child or having one friend join them at a time. If you are over 13, you can also only chat via text, but voice chat is coming soon. Finally, the maximum party size is six players, including the host.As the host, you'll have control over the games you play with your friends, as well as the ability to moderate the party.How to keep your Roblox Party safeAs the host of the party, you should absolutely be able to trust the players you game with. Should anyone need a time out, you can navigate to the group they are in, click the three dots on the top right of the screen, then the three dots next to the user in question. You can then “Report” or “Remove from group,” depending on how serious it is. Remember that if the user breached the Roblox Community Standards and Terms of Use, you can report the user first, then remove them to ensure that Roblox moderators are aware of the infractions.If anyone breaches that trust, either by scamming your friends or other questionable behavior, then it may be time to cut ties with them. Unfriending someone isn’t a nice thing to have to do, but it’s at least a simple process if you need to do it. If they’re an active user, go to the player’s profile on the Roblox website or app, then click the “Remove Connection” button. If you are following that player, you can also click the three-dot menu on the user’s page and select “Unfollow”.Suppose the user is banned, temporarily or permanently? In that case, you can find their profile by navigating to the Following or Followers tab on your Connections page, which we’ve provided a link to here for your convenience. From here, you can find the user whose profile box will be deactivated if banned. You can then click the three dots and then “Unfollow” as before.If all of the members of the Party someone else created are making you feel uncomfortable, you can leave the group. Use the Party tab on the PC app, find the group you want to leave, then click the three dots on the top right, and select “Leave Group”. This is under the Connections tab on mobile devices.How to disable Party ChatUsers aged 13 and over can disable Party Chat by checking the Connections page and changing the settings from the default settings to “No one”. You can also limit the number of Connections to a one-on-one party if you so wish.One of the many experiences you can play with friends is Tower of Hell, as you can see who can get up the course the highest as quickly as possible.Best Roblox games to play with friendsWhile many of the experiences could work with friends, some are designed with multiplayer as the main focus. Some of the best ones include party games such as Natural Disaster Survival and Epic Minigames, which do their best to invoke the chaotic fun of minigame-focused retail games, like the Mario Party series.Other popular games with multiplayer modes include Theme Park Tycoon 2, in which you and your friends can help each other build the best rides and rollercoasters, as well as competitive PVP games like Blox Fruits. Finally, if you’re a little older, Doors is a particularly decent match for friendship groups. As you traipse through the hallways with your buddies watching your back, monsters will spring out of nowhere to scare you and everyone nearby senseless.The Best Roblox Games To Play Right NowSee More
