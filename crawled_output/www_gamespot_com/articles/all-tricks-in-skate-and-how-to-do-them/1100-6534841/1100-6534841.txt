While Skate limits you to some simple flip tricks and grinds at the beginning of the game, there's so much than meets the eye. Skate offers over 100 tricks you can perform while on your board, and there are even some different tricks for wiping out with your character. You're free to figure out how to perform each of these tricks on your own time, but why not take a peek at everything that's possible?Table of Contents [hide]All tricks in SkateFlip TricksGrindsGrab TricksBelow, you can see every currently available trick in Skate and the buttons required to perform each one. As a note, the developers have confirmed more tricks are on the way, so we'll be updating this guide as tricks are added to the game.All tricks in SkateThe different tricks in Skate are divided up into several categories, including: Flip Tricks, Grinds, Grab Tricks, and Off-Board. You can find all of these tricks by going to the Skatepedia, which is found in the settings section of the main menu.The Skatepedia menu in SkateWe will divide each trick up by its given category and then provide you with the button combination needed to perform each one. We won't be including the "Riding" section of the Skatepedia, though, as those are more mechanical and not actual tricks.Flip TricksOllie TricksOllie - Right Stick (RS) UpKickflip - RS Up and RightHeelflip -
