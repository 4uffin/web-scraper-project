Marvel Rivals exploded into existence in late 2024 and hasn't relented in pace since. While 2025 codes for freebies in NetEase's hero shooter are scarce, the developer has been known to dish out rewards, including free skins, in the past.We've got a full list of the current active Marvel Rivals codes, as well as any that were once active and have now expired. We'll be regularly updating this guide as soon as new Rivals codes drop, so make sure to bookmark it.New Marvel Rivals codesThere is a new Marvel Rivals code!

In the past, there have been giveaways, Twitch drops, and platform-exclusive freebies. The current Twitch drops event is giving away the following items between September 12 and October 10:Blade Will of Galacta Spray - Watch 30 minutesBlade Will of Galacta Nameplate - Watch one hourBlade Flex Up Emote - Watch two hoursBlade Will of Galacta Costume - Watch four hoursTo claim Twitch drops, first ensure that your Twitch account is linked to your Marvel Rivals account by visiting the official website. Then, once you've met the criteria above, login to your Twitch inventory and claim your freebies. The next time you log in to Marvel Rivals, your rewards will be in your inbox. Any streamer who has enabled drops playing Marvel Rivals in the correct category will count towards your progress, and you do not need to watch the same streamer for the entire duration in order to qualify for the free items. If you're unsure how long you've been watching for, you can also check your Twitch inventory for your progression percentage.Peni Parker's Blue Tarantula skinAnother way to get free skins is by just playing the game. If you've reached far enough on the free version of the battle pass you'll be collecting the in-game currency, Chrono Tokens. 400 Chrono Tokens can currently get you the Golden Age Captain America or The Trial of Magneto skin from the battle pass pages, and these change each season. If you're playing the game's ranked mode, reaching gold by the end of the season will also get you the Siriana's Silver Angela skin. There are more skins to be redeemed if you've purchased the Luxury Battle Pass, too.Finally, Marvel Rivals events come and go, and sometimes these provide free skins too. The current Immortal Beast event is offering the Wasteland Robot Ultron skin for clearing its missions. A Costume Coin can be earned by playing the Galacta's Gift event. This Costume Coin can be used to grab a free skin from a small selection. The Best Marvel Rivals Character Based On Your Overwatch MainSee Moredepict the resentment towards
