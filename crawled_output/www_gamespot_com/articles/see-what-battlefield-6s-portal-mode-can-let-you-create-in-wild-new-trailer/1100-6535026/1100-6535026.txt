Battlefield 6 brings back the Portal mode from Battlefield 2042, but it's juiced up and gives players more options to create custom modes and maps. The developers put out a new trailer today showing off some of the zany things people can build using Portal, but when Battlefield 6 gets into the hands of a big audience, we can only imagine the kinds of things people will build using the tools.Community manager Kevin Johnson said, "Truly looking forward to seeing this level of power in your hands for the first time in Battlefield." Johnson added that the last iteration of Portal only "scraped the surface," but Battlefield 6's Portal mode gives players a lot more freedom.Design it. Play it. Break the mold ðŸ”§Forge the fight in Battlefield Portal with custom modes, object tools, a flexible map editor, control over rules and objectives, and more.#Battlefield6 arrives October 10. pic.twitter.com/GMHJzaQZv3

Johnson said it might be a fan who comes up with the next Rush or Conquest, referring to Battlefield's best-known modes.As you can see in the new trailer posted today, your imagination seems to be the limit of what you can make in Battlefield 6's Portal mode. As an example, we see tanks falling from the sky to create falling missiles that players have to avoid while riding ATVs. That's just one possibility of what people can make.Battlefield 6's Portal mode will also allow players to earn XP, and players will be able to find custom games and modes through the game's server browser.A bigger investment in Portal for Battlefield 6 is no big surprise. After all, EA CEO Andrew Wilson has said the company wants to lean into user-generated content to fuel the company's growth in the future, and it seems Portal will be part of that.Battlefield 6 launches on October 10 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.Battlefield 6 -- See 154 Explosive Screenshots From The Upcoming ShooterSee More
