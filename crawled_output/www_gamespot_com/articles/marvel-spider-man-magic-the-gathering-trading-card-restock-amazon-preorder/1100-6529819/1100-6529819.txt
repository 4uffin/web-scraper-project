Magic: The Gathering Spider-Man Play Booster Box
$180 (was $209.70) | Releases September 26
Preorder at Amazon
The Magic: The Gathering Marvel's Spider-Man Play Booster Box is on sale for its lowest price yet ahead of Spidey's September 26 arrival in the MTG universe. Normally $209.70, the box of 30 Boosters (420 cards total) is discounted to $180 at Amazon. The price has fluctuated regularly since preorders for the Spider-Man set opened in March, so this deal might not stick around for long. Adding to the potential interest in this promotion is the fact that every other Magic: The Gathering Spider-Man product is almost always sold out.That said, If you're interested in picking up the Marvel's Spider-Man Bundle, the Gift Bundle, or Spidey's Spectacular Showdown Scene Box, we'd recommend checking the links below frequently. Amazon has restocked each of them in recent weeks. The problem is that these restocks seem to sell out in a minutes. This isn't too surprising since this is a trading card crossover set starring arguably the most popular superhero in the world.Magic: The Gathering x Marvel's Spider-Man SetSpider-Man Play Booster Box (30 Packs, 420 Cards) -- $180 ($209.70)Spidey's Spectacular Showdown Scene Box -- $42Marvel's Spider-Man Bundle -- $70Marvel's Spider-Man Gift Bundle -- $90Collector Booster Pack -- $40Collector Booster Box -- $430

Marvel's Spider-Man - Magic: The Gathering Bundle

The Marvel's Spider-Man Bundle has been difficult to find since preorders for the set opened in early March.

Marvel's Spider-Man - Magic: The Gathering Gift Bundle
$90 MSRP
The $90 Gift Bundle has largely been sold out since preorders opened. Amazon has restocked it numerous times, but luck needs to be on your side to place your order. The last time we saw it in stock we added it to our cart but weren't able to finalize the transaction.The Gift Bundle comes with everything that's in the regular bundle as well as a Collector Booster Pack with 15 Rare, Foil, and Special Treatment cards. Another cool aspect is the box itself. The Gift Bundle recreates the cover of Amazing Fantasy #15 (August 1962), the first appearance of Spider-Man.1 Collector Booster Pack (15 cards)9 Booster Packs (14 cards each)30 Basic Land Cards (15 Foil, 15 Non-foil)1 Traditional Foil Alternate-Art Promo Card2 Reference Cards1 Spindown Life Counter1 Spider-Man Storage Box

Marvel's Spider-Man - Magic: The Gathering Collector Booster Box (12 Packs)
$430 MSRP
The Collector Booster Box comes with 12 of the $40 Collector Booster Packs detailed above.
