Sometimes the difference between nailing that first-time shot or shanking it in EA Sports FC 26 comes down to what camera you’re using. With the wrong settings, working out where your support runners are or shots on goal can feel like a real pain.But by carefully curating your camera settings to benefit you--and your setup--you can gain the upper hand in pretty much any game mode. So to help you win more games, we’ve been experimenting to find the best camera settings in EA Sports FC 26.Best camera settings for Ultimate TeamUT Competitive Camera: DisabledSingle Player Camera: Co-opMultiplayer Camera: Co-opHeight: 20Zoom: 0*The co-op camera gives you the best view of the pitch, in our opinion. It’s a wide angle that gives you visibility on both halves, making it easier to spot player runs and target better through balls.We’ve opted to max out the height of the camera to provide a more top-down view, while zoom is zeroed to give you the most visibility. However, if you’re playing on a large TV or sitting far away from your screen, you might want to increase the zoom level to make it easier to play.Personalised camera settings make all the difference in online competitive Ultimate Team games, so spend your time learning what works for you.We’ve disabled the UT Competitive Camera, which is new to the game, only because we found it too distracting. The setting is meant to give you more visibility of the pitch while still showing off the stadium and its atmosphere. However, we’re here to win games--not look at the stands.Best camera settings for RushRush Camera: Rush TacticalHeight: 20Zoom: 0It’s a similar story for Rush. We’ve changed the camera from the default broadcast to Rush Tactical to improve overall visibility and provide more of a top-down view.With only 10 players on a pitch at one time, you need to make use of the space around you - and you can only do that if you can actually see where the space is.So those are the best camera settings in FC 26--in our view, at least. You’ll see lots of professional players and streamers playing with different settings online, but the important thing is to play around with them yourself to find what works for you.The Biggest Game Releases Of September 2025See More
