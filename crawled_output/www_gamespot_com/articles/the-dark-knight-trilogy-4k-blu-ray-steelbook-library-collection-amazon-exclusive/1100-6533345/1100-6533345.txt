The Dark Knight Trilogy Steelbook Library Collection is back in stock at Amazon ahead of its release tomorrow, September 16. Outside of brief restocks, the $131 limited-edition box set had been sold out since preorders opened in July. The Amazon-exclusive collection includes four steelbook cases, a premium metal library case, and an assortment of collectibles themed around the beloved Christopher Nolan-directed trilogy of Batman movies starring Christian Bale. But if you simply want to own the trilogy on 4K Blu-ray, Amazon also has a tremendous deal that drops the price of The Dark Knight Trilogy to only $29 (was $75).We'd expect the standard edition deal and the Steelbook Library Collection to sell out. The latter previously released in the UK without digital editions. Walmart is actually taking preorders for the region-free version of the Steelbook Library Collection, but it retails for $190 and launches November 4.
The Dark Knight Trilogy Steelbook Library Collection (4K Blu-ray)
$132 | Released September 16
Easily the best-looking Batman movie box set we'e seen, The Dark Knight Trilogy Steelbook Library Collection has clean yet striking artwork on the metal display tin and each steelbook case. It's clear the designers carefully considered the tone and artistic direction of Nolan's legendary trilogy when crafting each piece of artwork found here. Each cover has a key character within a wrap-around Batarang logo that should look stunning whether you display the cases as unfolded landscape images or closed.Batman Begins features the Dark Knight himself, The Dark Knight has the late Heath Ledger's Joker leering at you, and Tom Hardy's Bane is ready to make a speech on case for The Dark Knight Rises. The fourth steelbook case is gold and features a flock of bats as silhouettes. Here's the full list of goodies included with The Dark Knight Trilogy Steelbook Library Collection:Inside the case, you'll find the following physical collectibles:Metal Library CaseBatman Begins Steelbook EditionThe Dark Knight Steelbook EditionThe Dark Knight Rises Steelbook EditionExtra Steelbook Case for:
Lenticular Art CardsCity Billboard Art CardsStoryboardsThe Bat BlueprintReplica of The Gotham Times NewspaperCertificate of AuthenticityAs mentioned, all four steelbook cases are housed inside of a library case--a high-quality metal display box--featuring the Batman logo. This looks like a pretty awesome collector's box set for big fans of The Dark Knight Trilogy.The nine-disc collection comes with three 4K Blu-ray discs and six 1080p Blu-ray discs--where you'll find the bulk of the special features--as well as digital editions of all three movies to download and watch on your favorite platforms and devices.

The Dark Knight Trilogy (4K Blu-ray)
$29 (was $75)
The on-disc content is the same as the standard edition of The Dark Knight Trilogy. As mentioned, Amazon has a limited-time deal that drops the price of the standard 4K Blu-ray box set to only $29. The standard edition also comes with nine discs, but you won't get digital versions of the movies.The 4K UHD versions of these three films are superb. Rendered in native 4K (2160p) with support for HDR10 and DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1, the nine-disc collection should be in every Batman fan's personal library.Each film has a rich selection of special features. Batman Begins takes a fascinating look at Nolan's mission to create a more grounded Batman, with featurettes that focus on the various filming locations of the movie, designing the iconic Batsuit and tank-like Batmobile, casting for the film, and a look at how Bale got into beastly shape for the role of Batman.The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises also packed with content, as these films explore the psychology of villains like the Joker and Bane, offer more featurettes to watch, and have various behind-the-scenes content to enjoy.

Batman and Superman are just the latest pair of major franchises to get an Amazon-exclusive box set with a library case. In June, Amazon released the Sean Connery James Bond Library Collection. And later this month, A Nightmare on Elm Street 7-Film Library Collection will launch exclusively at Amazon. Both of those sold out fast, though it's worth noting they contain movies that previously weren't available on 4K.Sign up for GameSpot's Weekly Deals Newsletter: More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals & Preorders
