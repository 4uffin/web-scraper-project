The Lego Worlds Collide 2025 bundle does have a couple of minor differences compared to last year's iteration. This time around, you also get Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga's Deluxe Edition, whereas last year the bundle included a coupon to get the game for 85% off. Additionally, the two Lego Harry Potter games are noticeably absent, dropping the total number of titles from 18 to 17. But you're getting extra content elsewhere: Four of the games that were standard editions last year are now Deluxe/Premium Editions that include season passes with additional content.Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker SagaThe headliner is The Skywalker Saga, the newest game in Traveller's Tales series. The Skywalker Saga broke from the familiar mold by offering large, open-world environments, an overhauled combat system, and a modern third-person camera angle.The Skywalker Saga was the biggest and most ambitious Lego game yet when it launched in 2022--though we'll see if that changes when Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight releases in 2026. And what we've seen and played so far has been quite promising. With that in mind, now's a pretty good time to revisit the first three Lego Batman games, all of which are included in Lego Worlds Collide 2025.For bundle deals on real Lego sets, check out our roundup highlighting all of the great offers in Walmart's Bricktember Sale.
