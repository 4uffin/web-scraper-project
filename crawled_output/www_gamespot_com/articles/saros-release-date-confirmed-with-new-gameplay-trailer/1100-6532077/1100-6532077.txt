During today's State of Play, a new look at Housemarque's Saros was shown off. Following the cinematic teaser for the game during the PlayStation February State of Play, this new trailer confirmed the release date is March 20, 2026. It also offered a first look at gameplay and how the protagonist of Arjun Devraj--voiced by Midnight Mass actor Rahul Kohli--can turn every death into a painful learning experience to help him grow stronger. Saros is a spiritual successor to Housemarque's previous game, Returnal. Similar to that action-packed roguelite, Saros is set on the planet Carcosa, a world inhabited by all manner of creatures looking to stop Devraj's investigation. Caught in the shadow of a sinister eclipse, Devraj has to deal with nightmarish characters that want him dead. It looks like they'll succeed--and frequently--but death is not necessarily the end for Devraj.The big difference between Saros and Returnal is that there will be permanent resources and progression to help players out should they die during a run. Housemarque says that you will be able to choose and permanently upgrade your loadout from an evolving set of weapons and suit upgrades to help you overcome deadly challenges on Carocosa.Saros will be released on March 20, 2026 for PS5.PlayStation State Of Play September 2025: All The Biggest Announcements And GamesSee More
