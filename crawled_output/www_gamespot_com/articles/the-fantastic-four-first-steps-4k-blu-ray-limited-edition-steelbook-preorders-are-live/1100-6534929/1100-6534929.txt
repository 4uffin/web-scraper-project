The Fantastic Four: First Steps is now available to watch from your couch by purchasing the digital edition from Prime Video or another streaming service. But if you're willing to wait a few more weeks, the physical editions offer much better value than the $30 digital edition. Amazon and Walmart have opened preorders for a handful of different editions of First Steps on 4K Blu-ray, Blu-ray, and DVD. There are three 4K editions to choose from, including a handsome Limited Edition Steelbook for $45 and an Amazon-exclusive collector's edition that includes the steelbook with a slipcover, a comic book, and some bonus collectibles for $75. The two Steelbook Editions and the regular $30 4K Blu-ray edition come with 1080p Blu-ray and digital editions. See all editions at Amazon
If you don't need to watch The Fantastic Four in 4K, the standard Blu-ray edition is up for grabs for as low as $25--though there is a Walmart-exclusive Blu-ray with pop-up art for $30. All editions of The Fantastic Four: First Steps release October 14. Note: Amazon's prices for the standard editions are much higher than Walmart's at the moment, but we expect those to drop soon. Neither retailer charges for preorders until the item ships, and you automatically get the lowest price offered before release.Left: Amazon-exclusive Steelbook Edition | Right: Steelbook Edition Quick look: The Fantastic Four: First Steps EditionsSteelbook Bundle (4K Blu-ray)-- $75 | Amazon ExclusiveBlu-ray Pop-Up -- $30 | Walmart ExclusiveSteelbook (4K Blu-ray)Amazon -- $45Walmart -- $454K Blu-rayAmazon -- $50Walmart -- $30Blu-rayAmazon -- $41Walmart -- $25DVDAmazon -- $35Walmart -- $20 Check out the collectible 4K Blu-ray and Blu-ray editions of First Steps below.

The steelbook case gels with the retro-futuristic trappings of the film with colorful character art against a muted backdrop. It almost looks like an advertisement for a classic sitcom.

The back of the case includes headshots of the team in their normal human forms with Galactus (Ralph Ineson) looming overhead and Silver Surfer (Julia Garner) flying on her cosmic surfboard.The Limited Edition Steelbook comes with 4K and 1080p Blu-ray discs as well as a voucher to claim the digital edition from Movies Anywhere.
