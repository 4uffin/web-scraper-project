The Fantastic Four: First Steps is now available to watch from your couch by purchasing the digital edition from Prime Video or another streaming service. But if you're willing to wait a few more weeks, the physical editions offer much better value than the $30 digital edition. Walmart has opened preorders for five different editions of First Steps on 4K Blu-ray, Blu-ray, and DVD, including a handsome Limited Edition Steelbook for $45. The Steelbook Edition and the regular $30 4K Blu-ray edition come with 1080p Blu-ray and digital editions. And if you don't need 4K resolution, the standard Blu-ray edition is up for grabs for as low as $25--though there is a Walmart-exclusive Blu-ray with pop-up art for $30.The physical editions of The Fantastic Four: First Steps release October 14. We'll update this story with Amazon preorder links once they are available.

The back of the case includes headshots of the team in their normal human forms with Galactus (Ralph Ineson) looming overhead and Silver Surfer (Julia Garner) flying on her cosmic surfboard.The Limited Edition Steelbook comes with 4K and 1080p Blu-ray discs as well as a voucher to claim the digital edition from Movies Anywhere.
