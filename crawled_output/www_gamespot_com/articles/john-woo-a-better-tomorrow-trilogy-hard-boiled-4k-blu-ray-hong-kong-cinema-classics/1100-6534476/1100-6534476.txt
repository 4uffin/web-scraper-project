When it comes to action, the golden age of Hong Kong cinema is hard to beat. During the '80s and '90s, some of the best movies in the genre were made here, and at long last, all three movies in the A Better Tomorrow saga are headed to 4K Blu-ray as a box set with tons of new special features. Restored by Shout Factory, A Better Tomorrow Trilogy is available to preorder for $83 (was $100) ahead of its November 18 release.Shout Factory is also releasing a 4K Blu-ray edition of Hard Boiled on November 4. This Deluxe Edition looks promising as well, but it's worth noting the price has jumped from $40 to $65 at Amazon and Walmart. It's unlikely to launch at this price, and you won't be charged for preorder until it ships.
A Better Tomorrow Trilogy on 4K Blu-ray
$83 (was $100) | Releases November 18
Directed by renowned filmmakers John Woo and Tsui Hark, all three A Better Tomorrow movies have been remastered in 4K from the original camera negatives. Each one is presented in Dolby Vision--and are HDR-10 compatible and viewers can choose between the original Cantonese language track or the English dub, in DTS-HD Master Audio mono and English DTS-HD Master Audio mono. If you choose to go with the original Cantonese audio, each film features newly translated English subtitles. You'll also get an exclusive poster in this box set, based on the newly commissioned art.Each film is accompanied by dozens of brand-new extras, which are mostly audio commentary tracks and interviews with established film critics, members of the cast and crew, and even notable directors like Gareth Evans (The Raid). The real jewel of this collection is the sought-after workprint of A Better Tomorrow 2, which was thought to be lost for years. This version of Woo's sequel was originally re-edited producer Tsui Hark, and it features an extra 30 minutes of footage. While Woo considers it to be the black sheep of the trilogy--the third film was in turn directed by Hark--he has still spoken fondly about its climatic gunfight as some of his best work in cinema.You'll also find the Taiwanese cut of A Better Tomorrow 3 here, which adds around 10 extra minutes of content, resulting in several extended scenes. The seven-disc collection includes 4K UHD and 1080p Blu-ray editions of each film.You can check out the full list of features on each disc below.

Released in 1986, the film was a big critical hit and it set the stage for director John Woo and Chow Yun-fat's eventual journey to Hollywood.In 1987, A Better Tomorrow 2 was released, and it featured a wild plot twist to justify its existence--for reasons we won't spoil here in case you never saw the first movie. Like its predecessor, the film featured over-the-top action, explosions, and a ludicrous bodycount once characters finally ran out of bullets.A Better Tomorrow 3: Love and Death in Saigon brought the series to a close in 1989 and it's a prequel to the first movie. Set during the final days of the Vietnam War, the story isn't the best, but it does boast incredible action sequences throughout. Interestingly, Woo's original vision for the film was different and led to him exiting the director's chair after he and Hark experienced creative differences. Woo's script would eventually evolve into 1990's Bullet in the Head.As mentioned, the other big new release in the Hong Kong Cinema Classics collection is Hard Boiled. Released in 1992, Hard Boiled is one of the best action movies of all time--and the best collaboration between John Woo and Chow Yun-fat. Over-the-top and incredibly fun, Hard Boiled as a straightforward plot centered around a cop seeking revenge against a gang of criminals. Mayhem ensues, the action is extreme, and Chow Yun-fat is effortlessly cool in every scene, including that iconic shootout in a hospital.

Like the A Better Tomorrow trilogy, there are also new English subtitles in this release as well and the box set includes an exclusive 52-page collectible booklet.The three-disc set also includes a standard Blu-ray copy of the film and it contains plenty of bonus materials, like several newly filmed interviews with Woo and other key members of the crew. Topping it all off is a collection of new audio commentary tracks with film critics and historians--as well as the audio commentary from John Woo and several more people that the Criterion Collection recorded--deleted scenes, trailers, and an image gallery.We included a list of features on each disc below.
