The best Lethal Company mods can fulfill a wide range of needs. The vanilla experience of the co-op horror game already hosts plenty of scary surprises and enemy patterns to learn. But if you're looking to spice things up or give the experience a fresh look and feel, there are hundreds of mods available. The vast variety of player-created content is a testament to how active the community is, but it can be hard to know what to pick.As you and your friends explore abandoned facilities in order to collect scrap and then sell it to meet increasingly higher quotas for your employer, there's plenty to learn and discover. While Lethal Company isn't exactly the viral sensation it was when it first launched, the modding community has plenty to offer to incentivise you to invite the group chat into a few new multiplayer sessions.If you've been on the lookout for the best Lethal Company mods to shake up the early access game, you'll find our top choices below. We recommend using the mod manager r2modman, which allows for an easier install process overall. It also has the option to export a code of your profile, which your friends can input on their end to install all the same mods that you have.Share this GalleryLatest Image GalleriesSee 40+ Images Of Kojima's Terrifying New Xbox Game, ODBest Fallout: New Vegas Mods To Download In 2025The Best Fighting Games To Throw Down With In 2025More CompanyCreator: notnotnotswipezDownloadlink: ThunderstoreDo you have more than three friends? If so, this Lethal Company mod is for you. More Company does what it says on the tin, allowing players to create or join lobbies that host more than the default four-player limit. Modder notnotnotswipez has tested the mod with eight players and found no issues with either connectivity or how the user interface accommodates the extra workers, so that's the ideal sweet spot. With this mod, the scavenging results and spectating screens also fit all eight players.MirageCreator: qwbarchDownloadlink: ThunderstoreYou might have heard of Lethal Company mods that turn players' voices against them, and Mirage is a great example of it. The mod gives any enemy the ability to mimic a player's voice, and this is fully synced to everyone in the lobby, meaning everybody hears the same voice and words simultaneously. If the prospect doesn't sound scary enough, it can also make it so that whenever someone dies, that player returns to "life" as a masked enemy, making them a perfect mimic candidate.Lethal ProgressionCreator: StonemanDownloadlink: ThunderstoreIf you're looking to add some extra progression incentives to Lethal Company, modder Stoneman has you covered. Lethal Progression expands the existing experience feature by adding experience points, numbered levels, and even stat upgrades. You can increase your health regeneration, stamina, battery life, hand slots, loot value, and oxygen level. Actions such as depositing loot at the ship and killing enemies give everyone XP. The mod provides a nice way to lead you and your teammates to pick different roles based on the stats you want to prioritize, and the playstyle you want to bring into each mission.GeneralImprovementsCreator: ShaosilGamingDownloadlink: ThunderstoreGeneralImprovements gives you a catch-all package with an assortment of improvements and tweaks. There are dozens of small changes and quality-of-life features, and most of them can be disabled or tweaked further depending on your preferences. Some examples include an option to scan tools, a decrease in the time required between scrolling through inventory slots, options to hide player names, a conversion of lbs to kgs in the UI, and more. Take a few minutes to read the full list--you're guaranteed to find something you didn't know you needed until now.Lethal ResonanceCreator: LethalResonanceDownloadlink: ThunderstoreIf you ever thought the audio department isn't Lethal Company's strongest suit, the Lethal Resonance mod adds over 700 sounds to enhance this aspect, pushing for a scarier ambiance. This includes feeling sound roll off objects with a mix of bass and subtle reverb for added effect. The mod is made out of completely custom sounds, and adds more sounds that the game currently offers for certain creatures. Oh, and it's safe for streamers, so don't worry about copyright strikes.NeedyCatsCreator: JordoDownloadlink: ThunderstoreCats in space? It's more likely than you think. The NeedyCats mod adds feline friends to the abandoned facilities, and you'll see them roam around during missions. They'll sit down quietly when they feel safe, but if you don't pet them regularly, they'll meow loudly. This, in turn, might bring the attention of hostile guests. A small price to pay to have a few fur balls chilling around.LethalThingsCreator: EvaisaDownloadlink: ThunderstoreModder Evaisa offers a couple dozen additions to Lethal Company in case you want to spice things up without doing complete overhauls. The exact math is as follows: 11 scrap items, six store items, one enemy, four decor items, one map hazard, and one game mechanic. There's a bit of everything, with scrap items including plushies, a revolver, and a glizzy that can be thrown at colleagues. The store gets a utility belt for additional scrap storage, as well as a remote radar to access the ship radar system remotely, to name a few examples. Alongside the clearly advantageous items, be careful of a deadly roomba enemy, as well as the teleporter traps that will warp you to a random place in the facility if you step on them.ControlCompanyCreator: ControlCompanyDownloadlink: ThunderstoreOne of the best Lethal Company mods available is an ambitious project like no other. ControlCompany allows you to gain direct control over most monsters, each with its distinct abilities and attributes. Using ghost mode, you're free to roam the facility and look for any solitary players to find the perfect opportunity to attack. It's a mod that adds a new massive strategy layer, strengthening the already daunting enemy pool with player autonomy.LethalCompanyVRCreator: DaXcessDownloadlink: ThunderstoreVirtual reality is a perfect vehicle for jump scares and moody ambiance, and modder DaXcess clearly knows this. LethalCompanyVR allows you to use a VR headset when you play (with built-in controller profiles for Meta Quest headsets, Valve Index, HTC Vive, and more), while keeping the game compatible with non-VR users as well, so you can still play with friends. You can use apps like Virtual Desktop and SteamVR, too. It might not be official VR support, but it gets quite close. If playing this mod encourages you to pick up your headset more often, make sure to check out our best VR games list for recommendations.MinimapCreator: TyzeronDownloadlink: ThunderstoreIt's easy to get lost in Lethal Company. While many would argue that it's part of the game's charm, the Minimap mod offers an enticing alternative. It integrates a persistent minimap on your screen that works both in solo and co-op modes. For the former, it emulates real-time information that you would typically receive from a teammate at the ship's terminal. When playing with others, it enables everyone to take part in expeditions, erasing the need to have a player stay back at the ship. Even with the mod installed, you can toggle it on and off at any time, so there's no harm in giving it a go.ReservedFlashlightSlotCreator: FlipModsDownloadlink: ThunderstoreEver thought that the flashlight should have its own dedicated item slot? The ReservedFlashlightSlot makes it so. This isn't free, however, as you must purchase it at the in-game terminal first. Once you do, you'll be able to activate the flashlight at any time, regardless of which item you're carrying in your hands. The mod proposes a change similar to Doom 3 BFG Edition, which made it so you didn't have to hold the flashlight anymore, unlike the original. Not everybody's cup of tea, but I'm glad that it exists for those who prefer it.LethalCasinoCreator: mrgrm7Downloadlink: ThunderstoreNot everything needs to be about work. One of the best Lethal Company mods available adds a casino to the company moon (Gordion), allowing players to use scrap items as currency to gamble on different machines. Aside from the much-needed diversion, you do have a chance to multiply your earnings and get closer to your quota. LethalCasino includes slot machines, roulette, and blackjack, as well as a jukebox, an ATM, and a bar including beer and pipes, because why not. Just remember to play responsibly.Welcome To OoblterraCreator: Skeleton_StudiosDownloadlink: ThunderstoreWelcome To Ooblterra isn't introduced as a mod, but rather a community-made expansion pack for Lethal Company. It adds a moon that has seven new enemy types, four hazards, more than 10 scrap items, and more. Amidst the new foes is the Wanderer, which is a passive creature found roaming Ooblterra during the day, as well as the Gallenarma, which is found strung up in different places around the facility's lab, unless they're awakened by your noise. If you've exhausted the vanilla Lethal Company experience, this pack is a must-get.LockerCreator: zealsprinceDownloadlink: ThunderstoreA mysterious enemy joins the fray. The Locker is similar to the Coil-Head in nature, responding to the player's vision, but with a few different tricks. If you scan the environment within a range of 90 meters in a clear line with the enemy, the Locker will activate and charge at you at high speed. It also responds to flashlights when aimed at it, as well as touch, which can be tough if you're running around the facility and happen to make a seemingly innocent turn toward a dead end. If you want to learn the behavior of an enemy that reacts to your actions, this is a great mod for it.Wesley MoonsCreator: Magic_WesleyDownloadlink: ThunderstoreModder Magic_Wesley has created dozens of new moons to explore in Lethal Company since the game's release. Wesleys Moons is an all-encompassing package, adding all of them, as well as other additions and a roguelike structure. This adventure includes questlines that include lore and voice acting that fit the game world. It's a showcase of the ambition of the modding community, as well as the potential of Lethal Company as a canvas for new stories. And hey, if you're looking for games with similar structures, make sure to check out our best roguelike games list.While Lethal Company is still in early access and there are no indications of a console port in the near future, we have lists covering the best PS5 games and the best Xbox Series X|S games, in case you don't want to sit at your desk after a long day's work.SkinwalkersCreator: RugbugRedfernDownloadlink: ThunderstoreOne of the best tools you have at your disposal in Lethal Company is communication with your friends. What if you couldn't even trust that, though? The Skinwalkers mod is a plug-in that allows enemies to learn the voices of your teammates and then use their voices to talk to you. So, it will sound like one of your teammates is calling you over somewhere, but if you listen to the call, you'll be ambushed by a monster who was pretending to be your teammate. It's a trippy mod, and every player who wants their voice used needs to have it downloaded.BetterStaminaCreator: FlipModsDownloadlink: ThunderstoreLow stamina is a common problem many players face in Lethal Company, and it's often a reason for dying. Fortunately, the BetterStamina mod gives you some leeway when it comes to the mechanic. The mod provides better stamina regeneration and slower consumption while also changing how the weight of your gear affects your overall stamina. If you've ever found yourself on the losing end of an encounter because you couldn't run, then this mod is certainly for you.MimicsCreator: x753Downloadlink: ThunderstoreThe enemies in Lethal Company are terrifying and varied enough, but why not add a new foe to the game? The Mimics mod does just that, adding the Mimic into your games. The tricky part about this enemy is that it will always disguise itself as a common item you wouldn't think twice about. When you head over to the item or get near it in general, the Mimic will pop out and have a decent chance at killing you. The mod creator states that there are ways to counter the Mimic, but you'll have to uncover those methods yourself.PushCompanyCreator: MidgeDownloadlink: ThunderstoreLethal Company is a game all about teamwork and trying to survive together with your party. However, sometimes it's more fun to sabotage your teammates. After all, better them than you, right? The PushCompany mod adds in a way to physically push your teammates, which can come in real handy when you're all trying to escape together. The push mechanic can be done just by pressing the interact button near a teammate, but be careful, as it might ruin a friendship or two.
