It's that time of the month again, as Sony has revealed a new selection of games coming to the PlayStation Plus Game Catalog on September 16 for PS Plus Extra and Premium subscribers. September is a smaller month in terms of releases--with just eight games being added--but there are some great titles here. One of the recent releases joining the library is WWE 2K25, a classic Legacy of Kain game will be playable for the first time, and you won't want to sleep on the cute horror of Crow Country.As a reminder, all PS Plus subscribers can also claim new games in September, as Psychonauts 2, Stardew Valley, and Viewfinder are all available until October 6.Share this GalleryLatest Image GalleriesWhere To Find All Tools In Hollow Knight: SilksongGames Like Diablo To Loot Your Way Through In 2025All The Nintendo Switch 2 Games (Confirmed And Rumored) So FarWWE 2K25 (PS5, PS4)Like other annual game releases, the WWE 2K series has settled into a comfortable groove of evolution--no, not the legendary heel stable led by Triple H--in stead of revolution with each new release. WWE 2K25 didn't stray from that formula, as this year's game polished up its hard-hitting gameplay, added new modes, and gave players the chance to go from rookie sensation to Wrestlemania main-eventer. Overall, a fun game--especially when you check out the Bloodline Dynasty in Showcase mode.Persona 5 Tactica (PS5, PS4)The Persona series has really taken off over the last couple of years, and while mainline entries are few and far between, spin-offs like Persona 5 Tactica help to keep the IP fresh. This is a turn-based strategy game with an all-new story that riffs on the Isekai genre, as the Phantom Thieves find themselves transported to a bizarre realm that's in dire need of a revoution.Green Hell (PS5, PS4)For a brutal taste of the wilderness, check out Green Hell this month. Set in the unique and uncharted setting of the Amazonian rainforest, you'll have to use real-life techniques to craft, hunt, fight, and gather resources in this challenging open-world survival-simulator.Fate/Samurai Remnant (PS5, PS4)Released in 2023, Fate/Samurai Remnant is a stylish action-RPG with musou genre influences and published by Koei Tecmo. As Miyamoto Iori, players will have to hack and slash their way through enemies during the Holy Grail War that has begun in in Edo-era Japan. Crow Country (PS5, PS4)Horror with a nostalgic influence, Crow Country drops you into a deadly theme park of the same name that's crawling with all manner of nasty creatures. Developed by the studio behind the celebrated Tangle Tower, Crow Country looks like it'd be right at home on the original PlayStation console, and as the protagonist Mara Forest, it's up to you to find the connection between her and the seemingly abandoned theme park in this cute but creepy game.The Invincible (PS5)Another game that aims to make your skin crawl, The Invincible offers eerie gameplay and a story that makes you think about humanity's ambitions and biases. It also has a fantastic retro-futuristic aesthetic, and as you explore the planet of Regis 3 to your lost crewmates, you can expect to uncover a grand mystery along the way. Conscript (PS5)Completing the hat trick of unnerving games is Conscript, a survival-horror inspired by classics of the genre. It's 1916 and you play as a French soldier searching for his missing-in-action brother during the Battle of Verdun. What lies beyond overrun forts, trenches, and the sheer dread of crossing no-mans-land during this conflict? You'll have to find out for yourself while navigating through wartime environments designed to feel oppressive and intricate.Legacy of Kain: Defiance (PS5, PS4)PlayStation Plus Premium subscription requiredFinally, the classic PS2 game Legacy of Kain: Defiance rounds out the collection this month. This is the first time that the game has been playable on PS5 and PS4, and it stars both Kain and Raziel as they battle through a world poisoned by conflict and intrigue. Dark forces stand in their way, and if the bickering duo can triumph, they might just save the world from damnation.
