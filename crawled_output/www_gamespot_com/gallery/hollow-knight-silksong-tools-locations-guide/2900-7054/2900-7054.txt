Are you planning to obtain all the tools in Hollow Knight: Silksong? These contraptions and devices are absolutely necessary if you want to brave the dangers of Pharloom. Several are amazing when used during boss fights, while others offer unparalleled utility functions. Our guide has all the details for you, but be forewarned that there are some spoilers ahead.Where to find all tools in Hollow Knight: SilksongThere are dozens of tools scattered all throughout Pharloom. A few of these can be purchased from vendors, but the vast majority can only be acquired if you explore every nook and cranny. Our guide is organized per region based on general progression. We've included larger maps, as well as inset images in some cases.Here are some additional caveats:The number and types of tools that you can equip are dependent on the Crests that you've found during your travels. That said, you can unlock more slots by using Memory Lockets.It goes without saying that you need to acquire Hornet's abilities to help with traversal. You can check our articles about the Clawline grappling hook and Faydown Cloak double jump if you've yet to obtain these.Some vendors sell tools in exchange for Rosaries. Other NPC and workbenches, meanwhile, also require a special resource known as Craftmetal.Many tools can be obtained during the game's first two chapters. A select few, however, come from Act 3. You can learn more about how to unlock this chapter in our Silk and Soul guide.Share this GalleryLatest Image GalleriesPlayStation State Of Play September 2025: All The Biggest Announcements And GamesCoD: Black Ops 7 Zombies Adds Zombie Bears, Bees, And A Pack-a-Punched VehicleThe Best Games Of 2025 (So Far)Mosshome tools: Magnetite Brooch and Druid's EyesMagnetite Brooch - This will likely be one of the first Hollow Knight: Silksong tools that you spot in the game. You can purchase it from Pebb in Bone Bottom.Druid's Eyes - You receive this tool as part of the Berry Picking wish that comes from the Druid of Mosshome. You only need to gather three Mossberries for him. However, if you find all of the items that he needs, he'll empower the accessory further. We've got all the info for you in our Mossberry locations guide.The Marrow tools: Compass, Shard Pendant, and Straight PinCompass - This can be purchased from Shakra the map vendor. It also happens to be one of the most useful tools in the game because it shows Hornet's position on the map. Note that the NPC will move around depending on how far you've progressed into the campaign, so you have to track her down if you haven't bought this item yet. You can learn more about this character in our Shakra locations guide.Shard Pendant - Found in a small room along the left-hand side of the central shaft in The Marrow.Straight Pin - Make your way to the cells at the far-right section of The Marrow--i.e. the bench near the exit to Hunter's March.

You should see the glowing item above you.Hunter's March tools: Curveclaw and Fractured MaskCurveclaw and Fractured Mask - Both of these items can be purchased from the Mottled Skarr vendor. To find him, go to the small room above the bench. Next, jump up and smack the walls as you keep pushing to the upper-left portion. Traverse the secret passageway to meet this vendor.

You need to pay 30x Rosaries just to enter his shop. However, if you destroy the mechanism above the door, the shop will remain open for later visits. Note that Mort disappears from his location once you reach Act 3 of the campaign.Curve Sickle - Enter the small room with the circular icon and make sure you've equipped the Curveclaw from Hunter's March. Then, position yourself and jump as you throw it so that the boomerang hits all four wooden targets. A red ant NPC will appear, and you can give the Curveclaw to it. Leave the room and come back to see a glowing item on the ground.Warding Bell - Go to the bottommost portion of Far Fields' main vertical shaft. There's a hidden path to the left that has the Warding Bell. Note that this also leads to Deep Docks and the aforementioned Flintslate tool.Silkspeed Anklets - You can acquire this tool after defeating the Bellhart boss, which nets you the Needolin ability. Play your Needle weapon in front of the cocoon door to gain access to Weavenest Cyndril. Next, sprint back and forth along the corridor until the plinth appears.Greymoor tools: Pimpillo, Flea Brew, and Threefold PinPimpillo - Go to the upper-left corner of this zone and check the area above Yarnaby's house--i.e. the NPC that's part of the Twisted Bud quest.

You can learn about this quest in our Lost Fleas guide.Threefold Pin - Head over to the rightmost section of Greymoor--i.e. the large building with lots of balloons surrounding it. Use your "pogo" maneuver to hop on the balloons until you see a ledge to your right. The item is inside a small nook.Shellwood tools: Longpin and Pollip PouchLongpin - Take a look at the large chamber near the exit to Bellhart. You'll notice a purple flower that can be destroyed.

It's a reward for completing the Pollip Hearts quest from Greyroot.Bellhart tool: MultibinderMultibinder - You'll free the townsfolk from the curse that has afflicted them once you defeat the Widow boss at the upper reaches of Bellhart. The Multibinder should then appear in the shopkeeper's inventory.Weavenest Atla tool: WeavelightWeavelight - As mentioned earlier, the Bellhart boss rewards you with the Needolin, an ability that unlocks cocoon doors. Once you have it, return to the cocoon door in Moss Grotto. Play your Needolin to gain entry to Weavenest Atla.

Take them out to receive your prize.Wormways tools: Dead Bug's Purse and Plasmium PhialDead Bug's Purse - The Wormways zone can be accessed once you leave Shellwood or, alternatively, if you use a Simple Key.

Sadly, this whole process boils down to luck, so you might end up wasting a lot of time.If you beat Lumble multiple times, leave the area and come back to find this glowing item.If you didn't beat Lumble but you've reached Act 3, you'll be able to purchase this item from Grindle's shop.Sands of Karak tools: Volt Filament and ConchcutterVolt Filament - You gain access to this area during Act 3 after you've obtained the Silksoar super jump ability.

As an aside, if you weren't able to complete the Roach Guts quest by the time you reach Act 3, then you'll find the item in their hut.Mount Fay tools: Memory Crystal and Pin BadgeMemory Crystal - Mount Fay is where you acquire the Faydown Cloak double jump ability. For the Memory Crystal item, go to the bench area in the lower-left corner of Mount Fay--i.e. it's the one which requires you to spend Rosaries to unlock. Destroy the breakable wall there and explore the passageway while smashing the ice blocks that continuously form.Pin Badge - You can only obtain the Pin Badge tool in Hollow Knight: Silksong upon reaching Act 3. Here's what you need to know:As you progress, you'll see the Fatal Resolve side quest on the Bellhart bounty board.Accept the quest and revisit the Pinstress' hut in Blasted Steps. Read the note to learn that she made her way to Mount Fay.Return to Mount Fay and, upon arriving at the area just before the summit, you'll see the Pinstress' head emerging from the ground. Strike her and defeat her in combat.High Halls tools: Cogfly and Rosary CannonCogfly - The Cogfly is one of the best tools in the game since it lets you summon little insects that buzz around and attack your foes. It can be yours by entering the small room at the right side shaft in High Halls. Interact with the workbench and spend a piece of Craftmetal to receive your reward.Rosary Cannon - To acquire the Rosary Cannon, you need to have an extra Simple Key. Unlock the door between the bench/fast travel point and the Threefold Melody gauntlet battle.

We've got all the details for you in our Wandering Merchant/Lost Merchant guide.Whiteward tool: Injector BandInjector Band - Ride the elevator down to the bottom of Whiteward, then continue along the corridors as it loops back to the middle area.
