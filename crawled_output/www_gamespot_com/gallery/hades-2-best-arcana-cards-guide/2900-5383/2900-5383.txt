In a roguelike game like Hades 2, you're expected to fail numerous times. However, you don't really have to start from scratch. That's because there are perks and power-ups that can help you with each successive run. Here's our guide on the best Arcana Cards in Hades 2. We also discuss how the whole feature works, and the resources that you need.Hades 2 Arcana guide: The best Arcana Cards in Hades 2There are 25 Arcana Cards in Hades 2. Once unlocked, you can keep some of them activated for future runs. This ensures that you have some bonuses to support Melinoe right from the beginning.Share this GalleryLatest Image GalleriesHades 2 - All Keepsakes And How To Unlock ThemHades 2 - How To Unlock Animal Familiars And PetsWhere To Find All Resources And Materials In Hades 2How the Arcana system worksThe Arcana screen can be accessed in Melinoe's room. Here's a quick summary:Most Arcana Cards require a resource called Ash before they're unlocked.Obtaining a card also unlocks other cards that are adjacent to it.While Ashes are often required, some high-level cards also need high-end materials, such as those that are dropped by bosses.Arcana Cards have a Grasp point value, which is the number in the upper-right portion of the card.There's a limit to the number of Grasp points that you have early in the game (seen in the right-hand section of the screen). This means you have to deactivate some Arcana Cards if you're above the limit.You can increase your maximum Grasp points by spending another resource called Psyche.How to upgrade Arcana CardsWhen talking about the best Arcana Cards in Hades 2, we also have to consider that they have basic/default effects. However, it's also possible to upgrade them further. This is done by completing an incantation called Consecration of Ashes (seen in the image above). It requires:6x Ash - Obtained from various sources (mentioned in the next sections).1x Cinder - Dropped by Hecate in Erebus.6x Fate Fabric - Purchased from the Wretched Broker or ordered from Charon's Chest at the Crossroads.Upon completing this incantation, you'll be able to upgrade Arcana Cards--select one, then press Enter (keyboard) or "X" (Xbox gamepad). Most upgrades require a new resource called Moon Dust. Later, though, you need materials that are harder to acquire, such as Star Dust.Resource location 1: Rewards from dungeon treks and Charon's shopThe most common method of amassing resources needed for Arcana Cards is to delve deeper into the game's dungeons. Along the way, you might notice the following as part of random encounters:Resources like Ash (i.e. grey slime) and Psyche (i.e. green slime) that appear as potential rewards in rooms.Charon might also have these for sale when you stumble upon his shop.Certain characters and gods might have perks that provide these resources or a means of increasing yields.Resource location 2: Purchased from the Wretched BrokerThe Wretched Broker in the Crossroads also sells these resources in exchange for Bones (i.e. a common currency you acquire as you defeat enemies and clear encounters). Examples include:1x Ashes for 30x Bones.5x Psyche for 30x Bones.1x Fate Fabric for 60x Bones.3x Moon Dust for 80x Bones.Resource location 3: Ordered from Charon's ChestAfter purchasing many items from Charon's shop, he'll appear at the Crossroads. Eventually, you'll gain access to Charon's Chest. This lets you order various materials in bulk. However, you need the following too:Obol Points - You earn these for every 1,000 obols/gold you spend when buying things from Charon in the dungeon.Encounter completions - Each batch of resources requires you to complete several rooms/encounters before they're delivered.Here are the materials that you can obtain:20x Ashes - Requires 1x Obol Point and 20x encounters.80x Psyche - Requires 2x Obol Points and 40x encounters.10x Fate Fabric - Requires 3x Obol Points and 60x encounters.Resource location 4: Moon Dust and Star Dust recipes/activitiesAs mentioned earlier, Moon Dust and Star Dust are used to upgrade Arcana Cards. Moon Dust can be readily purchased from the Wretched Broker each time you visit the Crossroads. Later, though, you can check the cauldron's Alchemy tab to see the Moonlit Essence from Shadow recipe. It grants 5x Moon Dust and costs the following:1x Cinder - Dropped by Hecate in Erebus.1x Shadow - Crafted via the Shadow Extraction recipe; requires 30x Ashes, 30x Psyche, and 3x Fate Fabric.Apart from this, there's also the Abyssal Insight incantation for the Star Dust item. It requires:2x Moly - Gathered from Erebus.2x Nightshade - Dig these up from dirt mounds in Erebus using the Silver Spade gathering tool. Then, plant them in your garden and complete encounters until they're ready to harvest.2x Fate Fabric - Purchased from the Wretched Broker.2x Pearl - Dropped by Scylla and the Sirens in Oceanus.This unlocks the Chaos Trials activity, which can be accessed via the obelisk in Melinoe's room. The goal is to clear a region using a specific weapon/aspect, while also being mindful of limited resources.Picking the best Hades 2 Arcana Cards for your next runNow that we're done talking about the basic mechanics and resources, it's time to discuss the best Arcana Cards in Hades 2. Below, you'll find a list of all the unlockable cards in the game, as well as their Grasp point value.Those with an asterisk (*) are the ones that we suggest. Likewise, be reminded that some cards have zero (0) point value, but there's a special requirement before they can be activated automatically.The Sorceress* - Your omega moves are faster.The Wayward Son* - Whenever you exit a location, restore HPThe Huntress* - While you have less than 100% magick, your attacks and specials deal additional damage.The Messenger - Your casts momentarily make you impervious and you move faster.The Furies* - Deal additional damage to enemies in your cast.Persistence* - Gain HP and magick.The Unseen - Restore magick every one second.Night - You have an increased chance to deal critical damage with each move in a omega comboThe Lovers - Take no damage from the first hit when you're fighting a Guardian-type boss (i.e. main bosses).Swift Runner* - Your sprint is faster and lets you pass through most foes in your way.Eternity* - While you channel your omega moves, everything moves slower.The Centaur(0)* - For every five locations that you clear, you gain HP and magick. To awaken this card automatically, you must activate cards that have Grasp point values from 1 to 5.Death: You gain Death DefiancesThe Moon - Your Hex also charges up automatically as though you used 1 Magick every 1 second.Strength - While you have no Death Defiance, you take less damage and deal more.The Fates - Start each run with a chance of fate dice that lets you alter location rewards.The Boatman - Start each run with gold.Origination - Deal more damage to foes afflicted with at least two curses (i.e. debuffs).The Enchantress: You can use a change of fate to alter location rewards.Excellence* - All boons you're offered have an increased chance to be a rare boon.The Queen (0)* - All boons you're offered have an increased chance to be a duo boon when possible. To awaken this card automatically, you must activate no more than two cards that have the same Grasp point value.The Champions * - Start each run a change of fate dice, and you can alter boons and other certain choices.The Artificer - Start each run with a chance to turn any minor find into a random major find.Divinity (0) - Any boons you are offered have an increased chance to become an epic blessing. To awaken this automatically, you must activate all five cards in any row.Judgment (0)* - After defeating a Guardian-type boss, activate three random inactive Arcana Cards. To awaken this automatically, you must activate no more than three cards.Our choices when it comes to the best Arcana Cards in Hades 2 are mostly based on increased survivability (i.e. Sorceress, Wayward Son, Titan, and Eternity), as well as higher damage output (i.e. Huntress and Furies). We also picked a few that help negate randomized rewards in a way (i.e. Excellence and Champions).The Queen card, meanwhile, should get activated because of other cards with their point values. Lastly, we only recommend the Judgment card if you've already experienced going for deep runs/clears. With the three-card-activation requirement, you could probably just choose among those we suggested above.That does it for our Hades 2 best Arcana Cards guide. We hope that you clear all the tough battles ahead.Hades 2 stars Melinoe, the Princess of the Underworld. This roguelike game promises challenging encounters as you keep retrying until you can have the perfect run. If you want more tips and tactics, you can head over to our guides hub.
