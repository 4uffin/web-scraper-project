What to play on Switch 2 right nowNintendo Switch 2 is out and setting sales records, but exciting as new hardware is, it's ultimately all about the games. The best games to play on Switch 2 games so far include a lot of familiar names, including some games from Switch 1 that have either received paid upgrades, or just run better with the increased horsepower.Mario Kart World gave the Switch 2 a well-deserved boost as its marquee launch game, and Donkey Kong Bananza is a superb single-player adventure that takes inspiration from Super Mario Odyssey and even recent Zelda games. This list will evolve over time, both as we spend more time with Switch 2 and as more games make their way to the platform in the months ahead. There are other games we expect could end up on here but we want to test them all to ensure that the Switch 2 versions are a good way to play them. We already found that Hitman, unfortunately, isn't great on Switch 2.For now, here are what we feel are the best Switch 2 games to play right now, listed in alphabetical order. With most Switch games also being supported through backwards compatibility (even if they aren't getting Switch 2 Editions or free updates), you can also consult our picks for the best Switch games to play in 2025.Share this GalleryLatest Image GalleriesWhere To Find All Tools In Hollow Knight: SilksongGames Like Diablo To Loot Your Way Through In 2025All The Nintendo Switch 2 Games (Confirmed And Rumored) So FarBravely Default: Flying Fairy HD RemasterA remaster of a great RPG from 2013, Flying Fairy HD Remaster looks promising based on our time with it so far. This version rescues the original from being solely available on 3DS and gives it a great-looking new coat of paint, while maintaining the excellent combat system. There are some modern conveniences added and some new minigames that leverage Switch 2 mouse controls, but all of that takes a backseat to HD Remaster simply providing a better-looking, easier way to spend some time with a quality RPG.See at WalmartFeatured in this ImageBravely Default: Flying Fairy%gameName%Get the latest news and videos for this game daily, no spam, no fuss.

You're Good to Go!We'll begin emailing you updates about %gameName%.FollowCyberpunk 2077: Ultimate EditionCyberpunk 2077 overcame its initial, rough launch through numerous updates and improvements to become a terrific game--one made even better with the release of the Phantom Liberty expansion. Both that DLC and the original game are packed into Switch 2's Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition, which also introduces motion and mouse controls for those looking for a different style of experience (you can even use a keyboard, apparently). Based on our time with Cyberpunk on Switch 2, it runs very well, and with the ability to play in handheld mode, that makes this a great way to experience an RPG you shouldn't miss.See at AmazonFeatured in this ImageCyberpunk 2077%gameName%Get the latest news and videos for this game daily, no spam, no fuss.

You're Good to Go!We'll begin emailing you updates about %gameName%.FollowDeltarune: Chapters 1-4There's nothing quite like Deltarune, a game that gives you all the tools you need to fight back against anything in your way and then encourages you to find a better way to solve problems. The spiritual prequel to Undertale is surprisingly earnest with the themes and emotions it tackles, while also managing to constantly surprising with how it approaches these topics. It's one of those games that you want to go into as blindly as possible so that you can savor its brilliant surprises in this elegant RPG.Donkey Kong BananzaNintendo's first big single-player adventure on Nintendo Switch 2 isn't a Mario game, but a fresh start for classic mascot Donkey Kong. Though Donkey Kong Bananza has a lot in common with Super Mario Odyssey, it sets itself apart with an inventive terrain deformation mechanic. The mighty Donkey Kong smashes his way through solid rock to find hidden secrets and delicious bananas, accompanied by the aspiring young singer Pauline. With the help of animal elders, DK unlocks "Bananza" forms that give him new powers to augment your exploration and puzzle-solving abilities. The central hook of smashing your way through layers of the planet core never gets old, thanks to a huge array of delightful surprises, so this one is not to be missed.Featured in this ImageFantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time%gameName%Get the latest news and videos for this game daily, no spam, no fuss.

It's still the best game in the entire Yakuza/Like a Dragon series, as it deftly combines gangland drama with hard-hitting action and absurd diversions off the beaten path. It's that heartfelt approach to being both silly and emotionally gripping that makes it stand apart from its competitors, and with new features like English voice-overs and expanded cutscenes, it's also the perfect starting point for newcomers to the series.See at WalmartFeatured in this ImageDonkey Kong Bananza%gameName%Get the latest news and videos for this game daily, no spam, no fuss.

You're Good to Go!We'll begin emailing you updates about %gameName%.FollowFantasy Life I: The Girl Who Stole TimeThe Switch was the perfect platform for cozy games, and with Fantasy Life I: The Girl Who Stole Time, that trend continues on the Switch 2 with an engaging combo of action, exploration, and crafting. Playing like a mash-up between classic The Legend of Zelda and Animal Crossing, Fantasy Life I is a relaxing RPG that lets you set your own pace inside of its magical world.Fast FusionAt $15, Fast Fusion is an easy recommendation for Switch 2 owners who enjoy a good racing game. Yes, players already have Mario Kart World, but Fast Fusion offers a no-frills, pure racing experience akin to the iconic Wipeout series.However, the one frill Fast Fusion does include is a smart one, offering players the ability to fuse different vehicles into one design to mix and match stats. It's also one of the few Switch 2 games to offer different graphics options. And don't worry; while the game currently looks very overprocessed with Nintendo's DLSS upscaling, developer Shin'en has promised that the game's slight visual hiccups will soon receive a patch.That one foible aside, Fast Fusion's design feels like a natural evolution of the Wipeout style.Featured in this ImageFAST Fusion%gameName%Get the latest news and videos for this game daily, no spam, no fuss.

You're Good to Go!We'll begin emailing you updates about %gameName%.FollowKunitsu-Gami: Path of the GoddessAn underrated gem from 2024, Kunitsu-Gami is a clever blend of action and strategy games, with its varied gameplay helping to keep things feeling fresh throughout. The boss battles, in particular, are a real highlight. The day/night cycle splits the game into two halves: Days see you planning the strategy side of the game, scouting out an area, making decisions about how to prepare for the battle ahead, and assigning jobs to rescued villagers. At night, you'll shift to hack-and-slash action as you battle against enemy hordes.What distinguishes the Switch 2 version of Kunitsu-Gami are its mouse controls: Tilt the Joy-Con to the side and you're able to control gameplay in a way that works far better than standard gamepad controls. That makes this the best way to play the game on a console, which could very well become a recurring trend with other Switch 2 ports.Featured in this ImageKunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess%gameName%Get the latest news and videos for this game daily, no spam, no fuss.

You're Good to Go!We'll begin emailing you updates about %gameName%.FollowThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Switch 2 EditionBreath of the Wild presents a similar argument to Tears of the Kingdom. All of the same improvements to Tears of the Kingdom 2's Switch 2 Edition are present here (save for the Autobuild sharing, given the building feature is exclusive to the sequel), providing even die-hard players a reason to re-explore Hyrule with the new commentary. The frame-rate improvements also stand to be a meaningful enhancement here--just imagine if you can finally visit the Korok Forest without the frame rate tanking.While Tears of the Kingdom introduced a number of steps forward for the foundation BotW built, the older of the two games is still very much a worthwhile experience. It has a demanding combat system that forces you to constantly weigh the choice of what weapons to use, rewarding exploration, and creative tools to use to solve puzzles. Both of these Zelda games received a rare 10 in GameSpot's respective reviews, and with good reason.See at WalmartFeatured in this ImageThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild%gameName%Get the latest news and videos for this game daily, no spam, no fuss.

You're Good to Go!We'll begin emailing you updates about %gameName%.FollowThe Legend of Zelda: Echoes of WisdomBorrowing the Link's Awakening visual style for a new adventure, Echoes of Wisdom has the distinction of letting you play as Zelda herself. Yes, Zelda finally gets to be the hero of her own story, as she seeks to clear her name after being falsely imprisoned for causing deadly rifts all over the kingdom.This being Zelda's first game, she isn't just a duplicate of Link with his sword-slashing h'yahs. Instead, Zelda uses a magic wand to summon copies of hundreds of things she encounters in her journey--traps, rocks, enemies, and more. This summoning power is used as both a flexible way to solve the game's many puzzles, and as a combat tool to summon creatures to your defense. As your summoning power increases the puzzle and combat challenges ramp up as well.Like the Link's Awakening remake on the original Switch, Echoes of Wisdom sometimes struggled on the original Switch, so the upgrade to Switch 2 just makes for a better experience, smoothing out rough patches and improving the frame rate overall. A free Switch 2 update also adds HDR support and optimizes it for high-resolution displays.See at AmazonThe Legend of Zelda: Link's AwakeningThe beloved Game Boy classic Link's Awakening got a modern remake on Switch, but it seemed at times to be pushing the hardware just a little too hard. That's not a problem on Switch 2, which has the horsepower to handle it and then some, making the remake run smooth as butter. That means you get to soak in the lovely art style that makes Link and the inhabitants of Koholint Island look like little maquette dolls without compromising on frame rate. A free update also optimizes it for the Switch 2 with improved visuals and HDR support.Link's Awakening was a trailblazer on Game Boy, squeezing a Zelda-sized adventure onto the modest portable cartridge. Its standalone story follows Link to a mysterious island being terrorized by Nightmare beasts, as he collects the sacred instruments to wake the Wind Fish. The gameplay is modeled largely after the Super NES Link to the Past but adds new elements like an item that enables jumping, and served as the template for later portable Zelda games. It's considered a classic for a reason, and the Switch remake largely didn't mess with success. This version also includes the Color Dungeon that was added for the Game Boy Color release.See at AmazonFeatured in this ImageThe Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening%gameName%Get the latest news and videos for this game daily, no spam, no fuss.

You're Good to Go!We'll begin emailing you updates about %gameName%.FollowThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Switch 2 EditionArguably the best game on Nintendo Switch will be even better on Switch 2. Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom both looks better (including HDR support) and runs better on Switch 2--the smoother frame rate really jumps out the moment you boot into gameplay. Load times are faster, too, helping to keep you in the action.Both Tears of the Kingdom and Breath of the Wild's Switch 2 Editions incorporate support for the Zelda Notes section of the Nintendo Switch mobile app (formerly known as the Switch Online app). This includes a bunch of new features: progress-tracking and voice guidance for hunting down things like shrines and Koroks; the ability to share Autobuild blueprints or items with other players; commentary from characters (including Zelda) when visiting certain locations; and more.Beyond what's new, Tears of the Kingdom is also just a spectacular experience that you can sink a huge amount of time into as you explore its expansive open world, which takes the Hyrule of Breath of the Wild and adds new underground and sky areas to venture through.See at WalmartFeatured in this ImageThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom%gameName%Get the latest news and videos for this game daily, no spam, no fuss.

You're Good to Go!We'll begin emailing you updates about %gameName%.FollowMario Kart WorldEven prior to launch, we had spent some time with Mario Kart World and were struck by it being such a bold sequel, especially given how Switch 2 itself feels like a conservative, iterative follow-up to its predecessor. It was also just plain fun in our time with it, and if there's a safer bet in gaming than "a new Mario Kart game will be enjoyable," we'd like to see it.The inclusion of Cow as one of Mario Kart World's characters might be reason enough to put the game on this list, but the new open-world format is a breath of fresh air for the series without jeopardizing the core experience. The racing itself feels largely unchanged from Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, albeit with some new forms of variety like the ability to race across water, a day/night cycle, an increase to the number of competitors in a race, and a Free Roam mode that lets you explore. There look to be a ton of tracks and new items, too.But, again: Cow. 'nuff said.You can check out our Mario Kart World review for a more in-depth analysis.See at WalmartFeatured in this ImageMario Kart World%gameName%Get the latest news and videos for this game daily, no spam, no fuss.

You're Good to Go!We'll begin emailing you updates about %gameName%.FollowPokemon Scarlet & VioletThe original launch of Pokemon Scarlet and Violet was maligned for its underwhelming visuals and even worse performance. While the duo haven't received any new gameplay features or changes on Switch 2, they do benefit from one of the aforementioned free updates, making it both look better and--more importantly--run far more smoothly, with a more consistent and much higher frame rate than on Switch. While it's not the best-looking game around by any means, the improved performance is transformative, making it feel like a brand-new game. That means those of us who held off playing due to that issue can now enjoy what we called the best new mainline Pokemon game in years.Pokemon battles are deeper than before thanks to the new Terastallizing mechanic, while hardcore players into shiny-hunting and egg-hatching will find welcome improvements. Its open-world format and non-linear progression also breathe new life into the series, making this the best opportunity to jump into Scarlet and Violet.See at WalmartFeatured in this ImagePokemon Scarlet / Pokemon Violet%gameName%Get the latest news and videos for this game daily, no spam, no fuss.

You're Good to Go!We'll begin emailing you updates about %gameName%.FollowShinobi: Art of VengeanceStreets of Rage 4 developer Lizardcube is quickly becoming the go-to studio for resurrecting Sega classics, as the developer just delivered another killer game with Shinobi: Art of Vengeance. Combining its eye for crafting engaging combo-laden 2D action with a beautifully illustrated art direction, Lizardcube brings Joe Musashi into the modern age with a rip-roaring adventure. The game is at its best when you nail its flow-state, as a killer combo of acrobatics, attacks, and ninja arts makes for a joyful homage to the classic Shinobi games.See on the Switch eShopFeatured in this ImageShinobi: Art of Vengeance%gameName%Get the latest news and videos for this game daily, no spam, no fuss.

You're Good to Go!We'll begin emailing you updates about %gameName%.FollowStreet Fighter 6The Switch 2 port of Street Fighter 6 has two big things going for it. First, it includes all of the extra DLC characters from the first two years of the game's life on other consoles, so characters like Akuma, Rashid, Bison, and guest characters Terry Bogard and Mai Shiranui are available from the start. Secondly, it's a damn good port of what was already a damn good fighting game, with impressive visuals, smooth gameplay, and a serviceable online experience.What's more, the portable nature of the Switch 2 lets you take SF6 with you wherever you go, which was technically possible on portable PCs, but Nintendo's console makes it easier for non-PC players to enjoy. Street fighting on the go has never been easier, as SF6 is a perfect fit on Switch 2.Featured in this ImageStreet Fighter 6%gameName%Get the latest news and videos for this game daily, no spam, no fuss.
