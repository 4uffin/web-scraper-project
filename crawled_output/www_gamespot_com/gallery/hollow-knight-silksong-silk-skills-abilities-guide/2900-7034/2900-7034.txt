This will likely be the first Hollow Knight: Silksong silk skill that you obtain in the campaign. It's fairly hard to miss since the game nudges you to explore this area thoroughly.Usage: Attack by throwing your Needle forward.Silk Skill #2: Thread StormRegion: GreymoorLocation: All the way to the far-right corner of the zone. Once there, use your pogo maneuver--i.e. downward stabs while in mid-air--to jump on the balloons until you reach the top. Note that you'll also find a Lost Flea and the entrance to Verdania in this area.Usage: Whip up a storm of silk around yourself. This is basically your first area-of-effect (AoE) damage skill.Silk Skill #3: SharpdartRegion: WormwaysLocation: You can get this silk skill in Hollow Knight: Silksong by reaching the Wormways. It's possible to access this zone early if you use a Simple Key. In any case, once you're inside the area, make your way to the far-left section while avoiding the falling worms and spikes.Usage: Dash forward and pierce through enemies.Silk Skill #4: Cross StitchRegion: Bilewater/The MistLocation: Successfully escape The Mist. Then, explore the Exhaust Organ until you encounter the Phantom boss. Defeat her to claim your prize.Usage: Deflect enemy attacks and instantly strike back. This is your parry-and-riposte maneuver.Silk Skill #5: Rune RageRegion: The SlabLocation: Acquire the Key of Apostate from the lower-left corner of Putrefied Ducts. Then, use it to open the door at the lower-right corner of the Slab--i.e. the one near the bench and fast travel point. Continue along the corridor and face the First Sinner boss.Usage: Weave runes of blazing silk magic that explode after a short while.Silk Skill #6: Pale NailsRegion: The Cradle (Act 3)Location: Make sure you unlock Act 3 by completing the Silk and Soul quest. Then, after obtaining the Silksoar ability from The Abyss, return to The Cradle where you fought Grandmother Silk earlier in the campaign.
