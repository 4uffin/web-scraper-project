Silent Hill f, a brand-new entry in the series, has arrived. Following the story of teenage girl, Shimizu Hinako, in 1960s Japan, this survival-horror game puts a major emphasis on inventory management. While you will always find yourself needing to make hard choices about what items you take and what you leave, collecting the inventory upgrade items found throughout Silent Hill f will make that a bit easier.There are 6 total inventory upgrades, four are available in your first playthrough, while the other two are only available in New Game Plus.Silent Hill f is mostly linear, but you will occasionally backtrack through locations. The items are listed in chronological order, with minimal story spoilers, but some events and locations are mentioned.Share this GalleryLatest Image GalleriesJump Space Tips - 8 Things You Need To Know Before You PlayAll Call Of Duty: Black Ops 7 Guns, Weapons, And Perks Available At LaunchAll Call Of Duty: Black Ops 7 Maps Available At LaunchShoulder BagAfter returning from the shrine realm and reuniting with Shu, on your way to Rinko's house, you can detour off down a side area. Once you reach this back alley, there are two enemies there, but the shoulder bag can be found on a wooden box in a blocked-off alley.School BagIn the middle school, you will have to decipher a code to open students' lockers. Among them is Suga Yosie, whose locker contains the school bag. To learn that her locker code is 505, you need to open Aoi's locker by using his name, but you can also just enter the code directly.Dirty Drawstring BagDuring the ritual sequence in the spirit realm after reaching Shu's house, you will have to complete three rituals. After completing two rituals, you will be placed into a hallway in the southeast corner of the first floor. One door will lead back into the main first floor, the other leads to a staircase in the southeastern section, which leads to a large room with a couple enemies and a crack in the floor. Loop all the way around the room to find the bag on a shelf.FuroshikiDuring the sequence at Hinako's house, you will be tasked with finding crests to open a door. This sequence involves finding calendars and placing them on the wall to change the layout of the house. After placing the second calendar (you should have one crest), this item can be found in the southwest section of the house. On the map screen, this is considered "Shimizu Residence III".Packing Tips (NG+)On NG+, new rooms and areas will be open for you. In the opening town section of the game on your way down the hill, there is a house just past the first shrine. Head inside and go upstairs to find a Balcony Key in a room. Head onto the balcony and use it to access the adjacent room, where you can find Packing Tips in a box.Embroidered Drawstring Bag (NG+)In the Corridors, there is a small room off to the western side as soon as you reach the first diverging path. It is inside this room sitting on a shelf.
