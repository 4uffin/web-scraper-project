Death, taxes, and video games getting delayed--it seems these are the three constants in 2025, with a number of high-profile video games getting delayed past their initial release dates. Some of these have been delayed far past their initial dates, while others have only been delayed more recently. To help keep everything organized, we've made a list of every game delayed right now, including those with delays announced weeks, months, or even years ago. Once a game has been released, it will be removed from this list.Share this GalleryLatest Image GalleriesSee 40+ Images Of Kojima's Terrifying New Xbox Game, ODBest Lethal Company Mods To Enjoy With The Group Chat In 2025Best Fallout: New Vegas Mods To Download In 2025Grand Theft Auto VIWe all knew this was coming, if we're really being honest with ourselves. Initially planned to launch later this year, GTA 6 will now arrive on May 26, 2026. Rockstar said in the delay announcement that it needs "extra time to deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve." Every Rockstar game from the last decade has been delayed.Featured in this ImageGrand Theft Auto VI%gameName%Get the latest news and videos for this game daily, no spam, no fuss.

Ubisoft cited wanting to make a remake that still feels fresh while staying true to the spirit of the original version, but it didn't specify how long the delay would be. The series has been largely on ice since Assassin's Creed exploded in popularity over a decade ago, though we did get the excellent The Lost Crown spin-off recently.

The decision to push the game to 2023 was made by developer Sad Cat Studios along with Coatsink and Thunderful because the studio has developers located in both Belarus and Ukraine. With the ongoing war, the team opted to relocate and had to pause development during this period. The second and third delays appear to be related to game quality as the team continues development.Featured in this ImageReplaced%gameName%Get the latest news and videos for this game daily, no spam, no fuss.
