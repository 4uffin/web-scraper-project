The best RPGs can be hard to find. The long-running staple of the video game landscape is home to some of the most memorable games of all time, but by their nature, role-playing games tend to be a big time investment compared to some other genres. That's why we want to help you narrow them down and make the very best use of your gaming hours and dollars. It's been an especially busy year so far for big RPGs, given the release of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, and the surprise release of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered.The RPG genre is so large that there are multiple subgenres that some games can fall into depending on where they were created or their gameplay mechanics. You'll often see RPG elements pop up in games that otherwise largely fit into other genres; action-RPGs like the Diablo series have long been popular, while RPG-style character building has worked its way into shooters, action games, and numerous others. And the worlds, characters, and stories that developers create in RPGs have been turned into movie and TV franchises as well.While there are hundreds of RPGs that are worth your time, we're going to shoulder the difficult task of ranking the 32 best RPGs to play in 2025. As a note, this list only features one game from a given RPG franchise so that more specific titles can be included. However, that rule doesn't apply to developers, so you're going to see some entries from the same devs. Our selections are listed alphabetically. For more, be sure to check our picks for the best games on PS5, best games on Switch, and best games on Xbox.Share this GalleryLatest Image GalleriesHades 2 - All Keepsakes And How To Unlock ThemHades 2 - How To Unlock Animal Familiars And PetsHades 2 Arcana Guide And The Best Arcana Cards To UseAvowedDeveloper: Obsidian EntertainmentRelease Date: February 13, 2025Platforms: Xbox Series X|S, PCThe latest from Obsidian is another journey into the Pillars of Eternity universe, exploring a new corner and from a new perspective. Avowed puts you in the role of a Godlike, a mortal who has been touched by the gods and given special gifts--along with a plant-like growth that marks you as clearly distinct. You're sent as an envoy to investigate the source of a deadly plague, and you become embroiled in both royal and godly intrigue as you go. What makes Avowed stand out most, though, is the stellar first-person combat, which is great at making you feel connected with every swipe of the blade or flourish of your magic tome. It also takes place in a wide open world to explore, giving you plenty to do between your questing.Read our Avowed review.Baldur's Gate 3Developer: Larian StudiosRelease Date: August 3, 2023Platforms: PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, PCBaldur's Gate 3 is among the most renowned RPGs in recent years. The game of a generation for many RPG fans, BG3 is one of the impressive feats in the video game industry. A compelling narrative that grips you right from the start leads you to fantastic locations filled with quests, side activities, and characters to meet. Some of those characters can be recruited to your party, and all of them have distinct and enthralling quest lines to complete. The number of choices you can make in BG3 is truly mind-boggling, with each choice having the potential to alter your ending. You can also build your character in a variety of different ways, giving you total freedom to role-play whatever you want, which is truly what an RPG should be about.See on SteamBloodborneDeveloper: From SoftwareRelease Date: March 24, 2015Platforms: PlayStation 4Bloodborne is From Software at its finest when it comes to game design; the bosses in the world are extremely challenging, but all can be overcome, and the world flows together masterfully. It's also worth mentioning the Victorian-era setting of Bloodborne is a true marvel from an artwork perspective. Like with any From Software game, you may to think Bloodborne is the worst, most unfair game ever created at some point during your playthrough, but all the trouble is worth it once you reach the end credits.See on AmazonChrono TriggerDeveloper: SquareRelease Date: March 11, 1995Platforms: SNES, Nintendo DS, PCChrono Trigger is a popular pick for many players' top RPG of all time, and there are no complaints about that here. Released in 1995 as the first entry in the Chrono series, the game takes you on a ride through time, visiting the past, present, and future. The story starts with a malfunction that leads to time travel but ends with a planet's fate in your character's hands. You'll visit prehistoric times, the end of time, and everything in-between in this historic RPG.See on SteamClair Obscur: Expedition 33Developer: Sandfall InteractiveRelease Date: April 24, 2025Platforms: PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|SThe first game from a new studio based out of France, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has a distinct style and tone all its own, set in an imaginative original world. The story centers around a civilization being slowly winnowed away by a hostile goddess called the Paintress, who once per year writes a number on an obelisk, upon which everyone of that age dies. The doomed people send yearly expeditions to stop the Paintress, each one failing but helping pave the way for the next. That premise lets you explore a strange landscape full of monsters and beasts, with turn-based RPG combat augmented by a parry and dodge system inspired by souls-likes. The production values are top notch and this debut has already put developer Sandfall on the map.See on AmazonDiablo IIDeveloper: Blizzard EntertainmentRelease Date: June 28, 2000Platforms: PC, NIntendo Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|SDiablo 2 is the famous series at its finest, and it makes for an incredible RPG that still gets talked about to this day. Even if you don't want to play a now-ancient game, there's also Diablo II: Resurrected, which is a modern remaster of the classic title. Diablo 2 features an intriguing story, plenty of ways to build your character, and an experience unlike anything else on this list.See on BlizzardDivinity: Original Sin IIDeveloper: Larian StudiosRelease Date: September 14, 2017Platforms: PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PCDivinity: Original Sin 2 is another RPG from Larian Studios, but this one came six years before Baldur's Gate 3. That fact makes it all the more impressive what Larian was able to do, as it designed yet another massive world full of unique characters and locations. While the characters in Divinity: Original Sin 2 aren't as memorable as ones in other RPGs, the world is absolutely unforgettable. From the start of the game, you're thrown into a conflict between magic users and those who wish to restrict all forms of magic. The plot in Original Sin 2 plays out beautifully, with your choices being the most impactful aspect of how the story ends.See on SteamDisco ElysiumDeveloper: ZA/UMRelease Date: October 15, 2019Platforms: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, PCIf you're feeling burned out on combat in RPGs, then Disco Elysium needs to be the next game you play. Featuring a revolutionary dialogue system, Disco Elysium is a 25+ hour epic that takes you on the thriller of a lifetime. You play as a detective with some special skills you can use to your advantage when solving murders and other crimes. However, as with any good RPG, you can make a flurry of choices throughout the story that affect how the plot plays out in the end. The voice acting in Disco Elysium is some of the best you'll come across, and you'll be gob-smacked at how in-depth the dialogue system can be.See on FanaticalDragon's Dogma 2Developer: CapcomRelease Date: March 21, 2024Platforms: PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|SIf there's a constant in Dragon's Dogma 2, it's that there's always a surprise around the corner in this grand fantasy adventure. There's a sense of discovery at its core, a drive to hold onto that feeling of joy that comes from a case of virtual wanderlust as you stumble into new locations, people, and dragons along the way. The hack-and-slash combat feels as thrilling as ever--not surprising given that Devil May Cry's Hideaki Itsuno is the game director--the Pawn System feels magical this time around, and the world around you feels alive at all times. Don't be too surprised if Dragon's Dogma 2 results in your sleeping schedule getting wrecked, thanks to its "just one more quest" appeal.Read our Dragon's Dogma 2 review.See at AmazonThe Elder Scrolls V: SkyrimDeveloper: Bethesda Game StudiosRelease Date: November 11, 2011Platforms: PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox 360, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PC, Nintendo SwitchThe Elder Scrolls franchise is arguably the best set of RPG games you can play. While this spot could have gone to Morrowind or Oblivion, the third and fourth entries in the series, respectively, we're choosing Skyrim for a couple of reasons. Not only does Skyrim have one of the best video game worlds to explore, but its cultural impact is as far-reaching as any other game on this list. When Skyrim was released, it became an instant phenomenon, as the developers pushed and exceeded the boundaries of what gamers thought an open-world RPG could be. Whether you're going into a random cave or completing a quest for one of the several in-game factions, you always have something enjoyable to do when playing Skyrim. If you play on PC, be sure to check out our picks for the best Skyrim mods, which can further improve your experience.See on FanaticalElden RingDeveloper: From SoftwareRelease Date: February 25, 2022Platforms: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PCFew games have as much hype as Elden Ring had and manage to completely exceed so many players' expectations. From Software's masterpiece features one of the best open worlds ever created, full of highly challenging bosses and enemies around every corner. The sense of accomplishment you get for beating Elden Ring is next to none for most players, as conquering the entirety of this world is a truly difficult feat. Elden Ring's world is also built on top of extremely deep-seated lore that you have to uncover for yourself in the most peculiar of locations. While there's not much dialogue that occurs in Elden Ring, few games make you feel as deep of a connection to your character thanks to all of the hardships you go through with them in the Lands Between. If you jump, be sure to check out our many Elden Ring guides to help you make the most of the experience.See on FanaticalFallout: New VegasDeveloper: Obsidian EntertainmentRelease Date: October 19, 2010Platforms: PC, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360Fallout is one of the most recognizable RPG franchises in existence. Sporting several games in the series and plenty of lore to go around, it's tough to pick the best overall game from Fallout. However, as many fans of the franchise will likely say, nothing truly beats Fallout: New Vegas when it comes to RPGs. New Vegas pulls you in right from the get-go, as you're shot in the head by a mysterious man with the lights of the Vegas Strip in the background. When you awake, you're set off on a gripping tale with twists and turns around every corner. Your choices play a vital role in how the game ends and you're able to pick a distinct side when everything is said and done, something other Fallout games struggle with.You can see where we ranked the best Fallout games in a previous list.See on FanaticalFinal Fantasy Pixel RemastersDeveloper: Square EnixRelease Date: VariousPlatforms: PC, PlayStation 4, Nintendo SwitchThe early Final Fantasy games were some of the most influential RPGs of all time, and the new Pixel Remaster versions are simply the best way to play them. Not only do the newly polished graphics and remastered music make the original pixel art and music shine like never before, each game also features boosts to aspects like EXP and Gold to speed you along. It's never been easier to experience these classics without all the grind. Some of these games have aged better than others--FF6 is the standout by far--but you can't beat having the whole early history of Final Fantasy in one package.Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2Developer: Warhorse StudiosRelease Date: February 4, 2025Platforms: PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|SRPGs often fall into fantasy and science fiction categories, allowing lots of room for magical spells and or alien environments. The Kingdom Come series is distinct in that it's set in historical fiction, placing it in a particular time and place: early 15th century Bohemia. That gives a more lived-in feel to the castle intrigue as you navigate the complex politics of the era, building up your influence in the region against the backdrop of a civil war. The combat has been more streamlined from the first game, and the quests are designed to give you lots of ways to approach them.Read our Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 review.Like A Dragon: Infinite WealthDeveloper: Ryu Ga Gotoku StudiosRelease Date: January 25, 2024Platforms: PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|SIchiban Kasuga's second games as the face of the Like A Dragon series--previously known as Yakuza--takes him far away from Japan to the tropical paradise of Hawaii, in search of his long-lost mother. The lengthy story has all the heart and hijinks you've come to expect from the series, and returning minigames like Sujimon are joined by the new and massive Dondoko Island quest. That minigame, which could almost be an entire game in itself, has you managing an island resort to maximize customer satisfaction while chasing away ruffians. Think of it like Animal Crossing but with more beating up thugs with a baseball bat.Read our Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth review.Mass Effect 2Developer: BioWareRelease Date: January 26, 2010Platforms: PC, PS3, Xbox 360, PS4, Xbox OneThe Mass Effect series features one of the best overall stories an RPG franchise has ever told. While the ending, or endings, to Mass Effect 3 soiled the series for some players, there's no denying how much of an impact it had on future RPGs. As for the best title in the series, we're going with Mass Effect 2, which was a step up from the first game in most ways. The world is more expansive, the characters are fleshed out, and the gameplay keeps you hooked for the entire game. Your choices in Mass Effect 2 also set up the story in the third game if you import your save, which is a neat feature that's not seen often in games even today. 2021's Legendary Edition bundles together and remasters all three games from the original trilogy. See on AmazonMetaphor ReFantazioDeveloper: AtlusRelease Date: October 11, 2024Platforms: PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X|SIt's up for debate what the best Atlus-developed game is, but Metaphor ReFantazio makes a strong case for itself with its exquisite design, polished turn-based action, and a cast of characters that you'll grow to love. A celebration of stories set in a world rife with inequality, Metaphor ReFantazio mixes escapism with real-world issues and pragmatism with idealism, resulting in a story that feels both magical and all too real at times. It's a stunning journey from beginning to end, and you'll never feel like you've wasted a single minute in this lengthy odyssey. It earned the distinction as GameSpot's Game of the Year in 2024.Read our Metaphor ReFantazio review.See at AmazonPaper Mario: The Thousand-Year DoorDeveloper: Nintendo / Intelligent SystemsRelease Date: May 23, 2024Platforms: Nintendo SwitchThe Paper Mario series is widely seen as one of the best of the Mario RPGs, and The Thousand-Year Door is a major reason why. The game originally published on GameCube got a vibrant remake on Switch, showing off what makes it so beloved in the first place. The colorful world never looked better than it does on Switch, and small quality-of-life tweaks and a retouched translation help it shine. Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door is especially notable for its array of great characters, especially a roster of usual Mario baddies who get infused with some personality to become his sidekicks.Read our Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door review.Persona 5Developer: AtlusRelease Date: October 31, 2019Platforms: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, PCThe Persona franchise is widely recognized as one of the best the RPG genre has to offer, and the fifth installment is where the series has shined brightest. If we want to get more specific, Persona 5 Royal is the best version of the game as a whole, but Persona 5 itself won plenty of awards in 2019. You play as a high school student who receives their special Persona powers overnight. These powers allow you to transform into a Phantom Thief, patrolling the streets for corrupted adults to change them into good-hearted people. Persona 5 is distinct in that you still have to attend school and classes during the day, which adds a fresh social sim/RPG element to your experience.See on FanaticalPokemon Legends ArceusDeveloper: NintendoRelease Date: January 28, 2022Platforms: Nintendo SwitchThis entry carries a few caveats with it. There are definitely better overall Pokemon games than Legends Arceus, including Platinum, Emerald Heart Gold/Soul Silver, Black 2 and White 2, etc. However, from an RPG standpoint, Legends Arceus allows you to truly step into the footsteps of the main character. The open world design mixed with classic Pokemon elements gives you as the player an unprecedented amount of freedom for a Pokemon title. The catching process in particular stands out, as there's much more depth to capturing a Pokemon and using your existing team to whittle down a foe's HP. Though Legends Arceus does have some standing issues, the game is perfect for those looking to fully dive into the RPG aspects of Pokemon. See on AmazonShin Megami Tensei V: VengeanceDeveloper: AtlusRelease Date: November 11, 2021Platforms: PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStataion 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo SwitchShin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance is a prime example of a game delivering both quality and quantity, as this remaster of the JRPG can easily consume dozens of your hours. The original game was a rough diamond, but this new version polishes those flawed edges and delivers an absurd amount of extra content alongside its quality-of-life updates. There was a lot to love about the original 2021 game, but the Vengeance edition amplifies its satisfying gameplay, vivid art direction, and engaging storyline.Read our Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance review.See at AmazonStardew ValleyDeveloper: Eric BaroneRelease Date: February 26, 2016Platforms: Nintendo Switch, PC, Android, iOS, PlayStation 4, Xbox OneWhile it might not seem like a traditional RPG, Stardew Valley is considered a role-playing game by its community and the original developer, Eric Barone. You inherit your grandfather's farm and have to tend to it in the best way you can. This involves heading into various towns to meet and talk to new people as well as exploring mysterious and dangerous locations across a large map. Stardew Valley is certainly a farming simulator, but the RPG elements are prevalent enough that it warrants a spot on our list. It's one of the best-reviewed Steam games of all time and still beloved by millions.See on SteamSuikoden 1&2 RemasterDeveloper: KonamiRelease Date: March 6, 2025Platforms: PC, PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo SwitchThe Suikoden games are considered among the best RPGs of all time for good reason, and that applies especially to the first two. Those games, Gate Rune and The Dunan Unification Wars, received a lovely HD remaster this year, featuring improved movement and retouched visuals. At the core, though, these are just the best way to play two classics of the genre, exploring a rich and detailed fantasy world and recruiting dozens of party members to your cause.Read our Suikoden 1&2 Remaster review.Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven StarsDeveloper: NintendoRelease Date: March 9, 1996Platforms: SNES, Nintendo SwitchSuper Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars features outstanding gameplay and a great story set against unique locations. This was also the first RPG in Mario, so Nintendo certainly started well. In Legend of the Seven Stars, Mario and Bowser, Princess Toadstool, and others are trying to retrieve the seven pieces of Star Road, which have been scattered across the world by the Smithy Gang. There are plenty of side activities and locations to visit to keep you busy in between completing main quests. A remastered version is now available on Nintendo Switch.See on AmazonUndertaleDeveloper: Toby FoxRelease Date: September 15, 2015Platforms: Android, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PCOther RPGs on this list are impressive for a variety of reasons, whether it be graphics, gameplay, story, RPG elements, or whatever else. With Undertale, the story is entirely different. The game was created and published by an indie developer named Toby Fox. While Fox might not have known it at the time, they made one of the best RPGs of all time. Few games have received more glowing reviews than Undertale, which sits at a 10/10 rating on Steam with over 100,000 reviews. The game looks incredibly simple at first glance, and it is, in many ways, as you play a child who has fallen into an underground world. However, the adventure you go on will stick with you for a lifetime.See on SteamVampire: The Masquerade – BloodlinesDeveloper: Troika GamesRelease Date: November 16, 2004Platforms: PCIt's not often that a developer can pull off a vampire game or form of entertainment well, but Troika Games truly delivered a masterpiece back in 2004. Vampire: The Masquerade Bloodlines allows you to fully feel like a vampire, sucking blood from anyone you can find. However, along this basic journey, you're forced to make moral choices that shape your character and the story as a whole. There are warring factions, tons of lore, and unique characters that make your first playthrough extremely memorable. See on SteamThe Witcher 3: Wild HuntDeveloper: CD Projekt RedRelease Date: May 19, 2015Platforms: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PC, Nintendo SwitchThe RPG genre was in a slight rut for a couple of years during the mid-2010s, and then CD Projekt Red released The Witcher 3. A true masterclass in every sense of the word, The Witcher 3 lives on nearly 10 years after its launch as easily one of if not the best RPG ever. The final chapter for monster-slayer Geralt of Rivia, the game takes place across a war-torn map that's filled with gorgeous and dangerous locations. The storytelling, individual quests, characters, and choices you make all have a lasting impact on anyone who decides to pick the third chapter in The Witcher saga. The Witcher 3 also has two of the best DLC expansions ever released for a game in Hearts of Stone and Blood and Wine.See on AmazonWorld of WarcraftDeveloper: Blizzard EntertainmentRelease Date: November 23, 2004Platforms: PCWhile you might not think of World of Warcraft when going over the best RPGs ever, it has every right to be included on this list. Arguably the best MMORPG of all time, World of Warcraft is one of the famous video game franchises of the 21st century. It still pulls in millions of players every year and has delivered steady content updates every year of its existence. World of Warcraft might not allow you to make as many story choices as other RPGs, but building your character and interacting with other players is extremely fulfilling no matter how many hours you have in Azeroth. New content continues to regularly roll out, with ambitious plans for the next three expansions, The Worldsoul Saga, being revealed at BlizzCon 2023.See on AmazonMonster Hunter WildsDeveloper: CapcomRelease Date: February 28, 2025Platforms: PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, PCMonster Hunter games aren't traditional RPGs with an in-depth story, NPC dialogue, and character choices. However, what they do allow for is unparalleled character building that gives you the chance to role-play as a monster hunter of any variety. Monster Hunter Wilds is the latest game in the legendary franchise and features the same general gameplay loop as its predecessors. You have a world to explore, teeming with monsters and resources that you can use to craft new gear, weapons, and tools. Then, when you feel you're ready, you can take on gigantic monsters that are crucial to the campaign in one way or another. These monsters can take up to 30 minutes to kill, and they're a true test of your skills and the gear you brought along. In Wilds, the main campaign is roughly 15-20 hours long, but the real gameplay starts during the endgame. This is when you get to really sink your teeth into the different character builds and monster hunting. You have access to more loot that allows you to try out dozens of combinations of gear and weapons. If that aspect of RPGs is appealing to you, then Monster Hunter Wilds should enthrall you for dozens of hours.See on FanaticalAssassin's Creed OdysseyDeveloper: UbisoftRelease Date: October 2, 2018Platforms: PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PCThe Assassin's Creed franchise didn't originally consist of RPGs. The early games, such as AC II, Black Flag, and Syndicate, are more seen as action-adventure games with a far more linear storyline and character progression. However, the new age of Assassin's Creed brings RPG elements into the mix, and no game in the series has implemented these elements better than Odyssey. Odyssey is set in 430 BC during the Peloponnesian War between Athens and Sparta. You play as a Greek warrior, either Alexios (male) or Kassandra (female), and get to partake in this war and discover some personal secrets about yourself and your family. Odyssey features dozens of different skills to unlock that can change your character's gameplay, and the story allows for some personal choices that have an effect on the world. You'll also be able to equip more armor and weapons than you'll know what to do with, and explore a massively open world that consists of both land and sea traversal. The core elements of Assassin's Creed are also present, so assassinations, parkour, and an arsenal of tools all play a part in your journey. Odyssey is one of the best AC games in the series and an all-around fantastic RPG.See on SteamCyberpunk 2077Developer: CD Projekt REDRelease Date: December 10, 2020Platforms: PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PC, Nintendo Switch 1+2CD Projekt RED certainly knows a thing or two about crafting world-class RPGs, and while Cyberpunk 2077 didn't start off terrific, it's now one of the best RPGs on the market. The game has fully recovered from its bumpy start in 2020 and has had a small revitalization in 2025 thanks to its release on the Nintendo Switch 2. Set in a dystopian version of Los Angeles, California, Cyberpunk 2077 follows the story of V, a criminal who gets mixed up in the conspiracy of a lifetime. A series of events results in V receiving an implant that contains the consciousness of a legendary rockstar, who guides you throughout the game. Cyberpunk 2077's world is teeming with life, neon lights, and in-depth NPCs that fully react to your actions. You can complete numerous side quests, unlock new abilities for V, buy or steal some blistering fast vehicles, or just head back to your fully fleshed-out apartment and relax. While the base story in Cyberpunk 2077 is incredible, things are taken to a new level with the game's only expansion, Phantom Liberty. It's potentially one of the best DLCs in video game history and truly encapsulates everything that makes Cyberpunk 2077 great.See on Best BuyHogwarts LegacyDeveloper: Avalanche SoftwareRelease Date: February 10, 2023Platforms: PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PC, Nintendo Switch 1+2Role-playing as a Hogwarts student in the Wizarding World was a fantasy for many Harry Potter fans over the years. Avalanche Software had a major task in bringing that world to life, and, fortunately, Hogwarts Legacy delivers an unforgettable experience. Set prior to the events of Harry Potter, Hogwarts Legacy starts with you creating your own fourth-year student at Hogwarts School. You soon discover that you're not a normal student, and you team up with professors and other students to uncover mysteries and conspiracies once you arrive at school. Hogwarts Legacy fully and faithfully recreates the legendary wizarding school right down to the last detail. You can explore the entire school, go to individual classes, be sorted into your house, and even go beyond the castle walls to the hamlets and other areas beyond the school grounds. The game offers incredible customization, from the gear you wear to the spells you can cast with your trusty wand. You'll also get the chance to fly a Hippogriff or a broom all around the map. Hogwarts Legacy is everything a Harry Potter RPG should be, and it's a blast from start to finish regardless of your Wizarding World knowledge.See on Fanatical
