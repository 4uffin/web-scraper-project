The gist is that you need to look for areas with sparkling light orbs. These spawn from shrines, altars, white flowers, and, in some cases, minibosses, too. The goal is to rush toward each light orb in sequence. Once you've touched all of these, the main light orb will fly off into the distance.Lost Verdania: Boss fight and rewardsNote that there's a miniboss in Lost Verdania known as the Palestag. That foe also spawns light orbs that you need to catch. Next, assuming you've found every single light orb in the zone, make your way to the top-middle section of the area. There, you'll be able to enter a house. Inside, you'll face the Green Prince.The Green Prince boss fight--i.e. Clover Dancers--is akin to the Cogwork Dancers encounter from the Citadel. But there are some notable differences:There's only one target--the Green Prince--not his light clone.The powerful ability performed in the middle of the room causes a cyclone that rotates.Once you've beaten the Green Prince, Hornet will wake up back in the ruins of old Verdania.
