However, don't let that fool you, as Elden Ring offers a massively deep role-playing experience. Developed by From Software, Elden Ring is a souls-like game, which means it offers tough, deliberate combat and extremely difficult bosses. When you're not fighting bosses or enemies, you can explore any extremely detailed and surprisingly large open world where you never know what's around the next corner. In lieu of traditional quests, Elden Ring forces you to find your own way and truly get lost in the world so you can create a unique path to your next destination.Fanatical and GameSpot are both owned by Fandom.See on FanaticalFeatured in this ImageElden Ring%gameName%Get the latest news and videos for this game daily, no spam, no fuss.

However, the recent arrival of Oblivion Remastered is arguably a better RPG experience than Skyrim. A complete remaster of the original The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, Bethesda absolutely knocked it out of the park with this release. Oblivion was already one of the best RPGs ever made, but the remastered version takes everything to new heights. Oblivion Remastered offers a massive map, quests that evolve as your journey goes on, and more loot than you'll know what to do with. You can also engage with various factions to carve out what kind of character you want to be, or just stick to your own devices and use the skill tree to make any build you want.See on FanaticalFeatured in this ImageOblivion%gameName%Get the latest news and videos for this game daily, no spam, no fuss.

Kingdom Come 2 continues the story of Henry of Skalitz, picking up immediately where the original left off. However, you don't have to play the first game to understand the events of the sequel. Kingdom Come 2 is meticulously designed all across the map of Bohemia. Characters react to how Henry is dressed or smells, quests can be completed in a variety of ways, and the world truly feels alive as you're exploring it. One of the best parts about Kingdom Come 2, though, is the dialogue between Henry and the other characters. All of the dialogue is wonderfully written and will have you laughing and crying at the same time at random points during the game. Between the dialogue, the story, and the world, you'll feel truly attached to Henry and his journey.See on FanaticalFeatured in this ImageKingdom Come: Deliverance II%gameName%Get the latest news and videos for this game daily, no spam, no fuss.

At the start of play, the game will decide the entire history of the lands and its people--naming rulers and factions and how different groups are treated and what made it that way. It also allows for contradiction, hearsay, and bias within this, creating a world that feels real and complex.See at SteamFeatured in this ImageCaves of Qud%gameName%Get the latest news and videos for this game daily, no spam, no fuss.

The game is surreal and messy and confusing and brilliant, all at once. It's one of those games that truly feels like an experience to play. The unique visual style of pastel collage, stop-motion, and 3D-scanned clay figures--as well as the incredible soundtrack--lend another layer of artistic merit to what is also a solid turn-based RPG.Protagonist Wayne is charged with stopping the tyrant Gibby and his minions from resurrecting a once-defeated threat, teaming up with other strange fellows and utilizing just about anything he can get his begloved hands on. If you enjoy Yume Nikki-style games but wish they had a plot and a bit more focus, this should be next on your list. There's not a great deal of direction, so it's not for the faint of heart, but Hylics 2 is an incredibly rewarding experience and one of the best RPGs you can play if you're looking for something a bit different.See at SteamFeatured in this ImageHylics 2%gameName%Get the latest news and videos for this game daily, no spam, no fuss.
