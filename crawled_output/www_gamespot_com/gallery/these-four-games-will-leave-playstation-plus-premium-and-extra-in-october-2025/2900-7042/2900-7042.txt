The PlayStation Plus Game Catalog will lose four games next month, headlined by Battlefield 1. The FPS will actually leave the service for Premium and Extra members on its ninth anniversary: October 21. That's not all, though, as Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed, Tour de France 2023, and The Last Clockwinder will also be on the way out on October 21.Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed sees four players throwing on their proton packs to hunt down another person as a ghost in the asymmetrical multiplayer game. Meanwhile, Tour de France 2023 is a simulation sports game in which you can make your own rider to take on some of the most iconic cycling races.Last but not least might be the most niche of the list, since it's a PlayStation VR 2 game. The Last Clockwinder sees players creating clones of themselves to harvest fruit in a game that mixes puzzles with automations.Earlier this week, Sony added eight games to the PlayStation Plus Game Catalog for the Premium and Extra tiers. A couple of the standouts on that list include Legacy of Kain: Defiance and Persona 5 Tactica.Share this GalleryLatest Image GalleriesSee 40+ Images Of Kojima's Terrifying New Xbox Game, ODBest Lethal Company Mods To Enjoy With The Group Chat In 2025Best Fallout: New Vegas Mods To Download In 2025Battlefield 1Ghostbusters: Spirits UnleashedTour de France 2023The Last Clockwinder
