Hades 2 challenges you to keep trying after every failure. Thankfully, you don't always have to go at it alone. If they like you well enough, you have allies who provide nifty accessories. Here's our guide on how to unlock all Keepsakes in Hades 2. Likewise, please be reminded that this article contains minor spoilers.Hades 2: Keepsakes guide - How to unlock all Keepsakes and what is the best oneOur Hades 2 Keepsakes guide has all the details you need as you progress deep into the Underworld and well above it. We start by discussing the basics on how Keepsakes are unlocked. This is followed by sections on the accessories given by each character. Lastly, we've got suggestions on the best Keepsakes in Hades 2.Share this GalleryLatest Image GalleriesHades 2 - How To Unlock Animal Familiars And PetsHades 2 Arcana Guide And The Best Arcana Cards To UseWhere To Find All Resources And Materials In Hades 2Nectar gifts, Keepsake rewards, and the characters you meetTo unlock all Keepsakes in Hades 2, you need a lot of Nectar. You can take a look at our Nectar sources guide to see how you can acquire several of these concoctions.Now, when you meet a supporting character in the game (or a god's sigil/boon), you might see the Gift option. Press the button and select the Nectar to hand it over. The first time you gift Nectar to an NPC, they'll give you their Keepsake as a reward. There are, however, some caveats when it comes to the characters themselves:Crossroads NPCs - Most of these characters can be gifted Nectar as soon as you have one. But there are times when they might not be present in the area. You can reenter the main chamber to see if they've respawned. If not, then you might need to do another run to see them reappear in the hub.Olympians - You give Nectar to (most) Olympian gods by clicking the Gift button when next to their sigil. This must be done before you select the Talk option (i.e. the first time you encounter them in a particular run).Dungeon NPCs - These characters may not always appear during your dungeon treks. It's all random, so just keep your fingers crossed.Surface World NPCs - Furthermore, there are some characters that are only found in the surface world (i.e. City of Ephyra and Rifts of Thessaly). There's a fairly convoluted process that allows you to reach new zones. You can learn more about this in our surface world/wards guide.Kindred Keepsakes and leveling up your collection of accessoriesThere are 33 unlockable Keepsakes in Hades 2. These accessories can be seen in a repository/cabinet in Melinoe's room.If you’re looking for the new Keepsakes related to the 1.0 version of Hades 2, make sure to scroll down to the bottom of the list to see the unlock requirements.Here are a couple of notable tidbits:The effects of a Keepsake that you've equipped will be improved upon completing several encounters. The idea is to focus on a particular Keepsake that you like until you've maxed out its level.By default, you're allowed to equip only one Keepsake per run. However, once you've completed the Kindred Keepsakes incantation, the repository will also appear in the transition areas between major zones (i.e. after main boss fights). This allows you to change your current Keepsake for something else, which is useful if you plan on leveling something else or if you want a particular accessory's effects/procs.The Kindred Keepsakes incantation requires the following materials:
2x Moly - Collect these golden flowers in the Erebus zone.1x Lotus - Collect these pink flowers in the Oceanus zone.4x Lime - Equip the Crescent Pick gathering tool. Then, use it to mine Limestone deposits in the Oceanus zone.HecateLocation: CrossroadsKeepsake: Silver WheelEffect: After spending magick, you can restore the amount over the next three seconds; you can replenish up to 1,000 magick per run.NemesisLocation: CrossroadsKeepsake: Evil EyeEffect: Deal +20% damage to the last foe that vanquished you. Note that this applies to bosses and regular mobs.OdysseusLocation: CrossroadsKeepsake: Knuckle BonesEffect: The next Guardian (i.e. main boss) you face loses -5% HP. You take -15% damage from Guardians.DoraLocation: CrossroadsKeepsake: Ghost OnionEffect: Whenever you exit a location, fully restore your HP. You can restore up to 50 HP in total per run.SchelemeusLocation: CrossroadsKeepsake: Luckier ToothEffect: When Melinoe's health falls to zero, automatically restore +51 HP (once per run).MorosLocation: Crossroads - Note that you must complete the Doomed Beckoning incantation for Moros to become a resident of the Crossroads hub.Keepsake: Engraved PinEffect: If Melinoe's HP falls to zero, she becomes impervious/immune to all damage for 10 seconds and gains +30 HP. If you're able to defeat all enemies (including additional spawns), you get to live. If you fail, Melinoe perishes (or uses up a Death Defiance).ErisLocation: Crossroads - You must first meet Eris in various regions in the Underworld. Later, she'll appear at the Crossroads. She tends to vanish more frequently compared to other NPCs in the hub.Keepsake: Discordant BellEffect: You deal and receive +0.5% more damage; this effect stacks with each encounter that you clear.AphroditeLocation: Underworld and surface worldKeepsake: Beautiful MirrorEffect: Boons from this deity are more likely to appear; you can increase the rarity of this deity's boons once per run.ApolloLocation: Underworld and surface worldKeepsake: Harmonic PhotonEffect: Boons from this deity are more likely to appear; you can increase the rarity of this deity's boons once per run.ArtemisLocation: Underworld and surface world - Note that Artemis' appearance is even more random and unpredictable compared to other Olympians. You can learn more in our Artemis boons guide.Keepsake: White AntlerEffect: Gain +20% critical hit chance if you have 30 HP or less.ChaosLocation: Underworld - As far as we've seen, Primordial Chaos' realm only appears in the Underworld. Just like Artemis, it's hard to determine when and if you'd spot it during your attempts. You can learn more in our Chaos boons guide.Keepsake: Transcendent EmbryoEffect: Gain a random Chaos blessing once per run; this is replaced every eight encounters.DemeterLocation: Underworld and surface worldKeepsake: Barley SheafEffect: Boons from this deity are more likely to appear; you can increase the rarity of this deity's boons once per run.HephaestusLocation: Underworld and surface worldKeepsake: Adamant ShardEffect: Boons from this deity are more likely to appear; you can increase the rarity of this deity's boons once per run.HeraLocation: Underworld and surface worldKeepsake: Iridescent FanEffect: Boons from this deity are more likely to appear; you can increase the rarity of this deity's boons once per run.HermesLocation: Underworld and surface worldKeepsake: Metallic DropletEffect: You move, strike, and channel omega abilities 200% faster for the next 200 seconds.HestiaLocation: Underworld and surface worldKeepsake: Everlasting EmberEffect: Boons from this deity are more likely to appear; you can increase the rarity of this deity's boons once per run.PoseidonLocation: Underworld and surface worldKeepsake: Vivid SeaEffect: Boons from this deity are more likely to appear; you can increase the rarity of this deity's boons once per run.SeleneLocation: Underworld and surface world - The hex granted by Selene is more akin to a super ability.

Note that you have to meet up and speak with Echo a couple of times before the Gift button appears.Keepsake: Concave StoneEffect: After choosing a boon, there's a chance that you'll take an extra boon; can only happen once per run.HeraclesLocation: Surface World (City of Ephyra) - Once you've managed to reach the surface world, you're bound to meet Heracles during one of your treks in the City of Ephyra. He appears randomly during encounters, similar to Artemis and Icarus. The first couple of times you see him, you might not be able to gift Nectar. However, you should be able to give a gift on your third meeting onward.Keepsake: Lion FangEffect: Deal +30% bonus damage, but lose 5% of this bonus after each encounter.MedeaLocation: Surface World (City of Ephyra) - Enter the room that has a hand with the dialogue box symbol.Keepsake: Blackened FleeceEffect: After you take a total of 250 damage, your omega abilities deal +20% damage.CirceLocation: Surface World (Rifts of Thessaly) - Reach the portion where you have to battle foes aboard multiple ships. If you're lucky, you might see a door with the hands and dialogue box symbol.Keepsake: Crystal FigurineEffect: After the next Guardian boss, you activate one random Arcana Card.IcarusLocation: Surface World (Rifts of Thessaly) - Icarus appears randomly to help you during encounters at the ships. There's a chance that you won't be able to give a gift during your first couple of meetings. Keep at it and, eventually, luck will be on your side when you cross paths with him again.Keepsake: Experimental HammerEffect: Gain a random Daedalus Hammer effect (for your current weapon); this effect lasts for 10 encounters.AresLocation: Underworld and surface worldKeepsake: Sword HiltEffect: Boons from this deity are more likely to appear; you can increase the rarity of this deity's boons once per run.AthenaLocation: Surface worldKeepsake: Gorgon AmuletEffect: While you have no Death Defiance, Athena may appear once this night to offer boonsDionysusLocation: Surface worldKeepsake: Fig LeafEffect: A single encounter in a region may be blissfully free from foes the rest of this nightHades and PersephoneLocation: Obtained during underworld runs. At the House of Hades, the region where you fight Chronos, make sure to visit the NPC room to find Hades and Persephone. Offer them Nectar, and you'll get the Keepsake. This won't become available until after you've beaten the main storyKeepsake: Jeweled PomEffect: While at the Fates' Whim, gain a random Hades blessing and most boons get a bonus levelZagreusLocation: Obtained after beating Zagreus twice at Elysium--these fights won't become available until you've finished the main storyKeepsake: Calling CardEffect: While at the Fates' Whim, you can rarify Olympian blessings a couple of times this nightChronosLocation: Obtained during underworld runs, speaking to Chronos after the fight with Hecate and right before entering Oceanus, near the water fountain. You have to offer him Nectar. It's worth mentioning that this won't become available until you've finished the main story.Keepsake: Time PieceEffect: While at the Fates' Whim, you can purge most rewards for gold a couple of times this nightBest Keepsake from Crossroads NPCs: Schelemeus' Lucky ToothThe best Keepsake in Hades 2, at least in the early-game, is Schelemeus' Tooth. It essentially acts like an extra life or Death's Defiance. In moments when you're unlucky (or careless), it could save you from having to restart your run. You can learn more about extra lives in our Death Defiance guide.Best Keepsake from Crossroads NPCs: Moros' Engraved PinSpeaking of Death Defiance, Moros' Engraved Pin is another great option, albeit one that's also extremely risky. Basically, if your HP drops to zero, Moros will start a 10-second countdown of your impending doom. If you manage to defeat all enemies within the time limit, then you just saved your life. If not, Melinoe will perish (or use up one of her Death Defiance tokens).Engraved Pin is one of the best Keepsakes in Hades 2 since it triggers before all other Death Defiance tokens (the moment your HP reaches zero). Technically, it means you have an unlimited number of extra lives.The biggest problem is if you're unable to eliminate all hostiles within the 10-second time limit. For instance, maybe an additional enemy wave just spawned or the boss' HP is still too high. It would mean Melinoe's death or a wasted Death Defiance token. Likewise, it only grants a small amount of HP, and you're often at risk of perishing against hard-hitting foes in the later stages of your run.Best Keepsake from Olympians: Demeter, Apollo, or HephaestusA more generalized approach involves equipping a Keepsake from an Olympian whose boons are ideal for your playstyle. For instance, let's say you prefer freezing your enemies dead in their tracks. That means you should bring Demeter's Barley Sheaf to make the appearance of her boons more likely. You may also increase the rarity of her boons once per run.You can learn about the ideal skills and abilities in our best boons/build guide.Best Keepsake from dungeon NPCs: Echo's Concave StoneThe reason why we feel that Echo's Concave Stone is one of the best Keepsakes in Hades 2 is that it leads to ideal starts. Imagine the beginning of a run where you see a boon from Hephaestus or Demeter. More often than not, you can only choose one blessing. However, with the Concave Stone, there's a chance that you'd pick an extra blessing automatically. In most cases, this is also beneficial in the long run, such as getting one of Hestia's abilities that applies scorch, as well as a passive that increases the effects of scorch.Best Keepsake for permanent upgrades in your run: Chaos' Transcendent EmbryoSpeaking of the Concave Stone, the Transcendent Embryo is another Keepsake that can truly aid you for the entirety of your run. The way this accessory works is that you receive a random Chaos blessing (without a curse/detrimental modifier) that changes every eight encounters. If you decide to replace this accessory in the transition areas between zones, you get to keep the blessing for the rest of your run.Here's a good example of how to use these accessories effectively:Start with Concave Stone to, hopefully, get two abilities that you need early on.Assuming you've completed the Kindred Keepsakes Incantation, you can switch to Transcendent Embryo after clearing Erebus.From there, let's say Transcendent Embryo randomly gives you a Chaos blessing like Will or Blood just as you're about to leave Oceanus.Replace Transcendent Embryo with something else. You'll still keep the Chaos blessing that it granted even if you switch to another Keepsake.In any case, that does it for our Hades 2 Keepsakes guide. For other unlocks, you can check our Nocturnal Arms weapons/aspects guide, Arcana Cards guide, and Incantations guide.Hades 2 stars Melinoe, the Princess of the Underworld. This roguelike game promises challenging encounters as you keep retrying until you can have the perfect run. If you want more tips and tactics, you can head over to our guides hub.
