It's located in the top-right portion of the map, and is reachable via Memorium or Bilewater. You do need to be careful in this zone, though, because there are deadly vines that can grab and chew through Hornet easily.Once you've arrived in Putrefied Ducts, go to the bottom-left corner of the zone. Enter the hut, which also has a bench, and talk to an NPC named the Huntress. She tells you that she hungers for meat that could feed her brood.Note: You'll find the Key of Apostate in the upper-left corner of this chamber. It unlocks a couple of doors in The Slab.Where to find the right tools for Broodfeast?As mentioned earlier, you need to use specific tools if you want to complete the Broodfeast quest:Sting Shard (Deep Docks) - Purchase from the Forge Daughter for 140x Rosaries and 1x Craftmetal.Flintslate (Deep Docks) - Use the Simple Key to unlock the ornate door to the east of the Forge Daughter's area. The Flintslate is in a small nook at the top of the second chamber.Cogwork Wheel (The Underworks) - Purchase from the Twelfth Architect for 360x Rosaries and 1x Craftmetal.Architect's Crest (The Underworks) - Buy five of the Architect's tools/devices, then purchase her key.

Well, just make sure that you use the aforementioned tools to land the killing blow on regular enemies. Here's a quick summary:Skewered Organs - Sting Shard is a trap, so toss it at a foe that you think would die soon.Seared Organs - Flintslate, when activated, temporarily imbues your weapon with fire. Make sure you defeat enemies while you have the elemental effect. Note that you cannot equip the Pollip Pouch while doing this task, as that changes the Flintslate's elemental damage to poison.Shredded Organs - The Cogwork Wheel, as well as the Architect Crest's normal/pogo attacks, have a "drill-like" motion that shreds foes.Broodfeast quest rewardsOnce you have all the organs, return to the hut in Putrefied Ducts. You'll realized that the Huntress is no more. Instead, a lil' fella named Runt has replaced her. Give all the organs to Runt to complete the task.That does it for our guide on how to complete Broodfeast in Hollow Knight: Silksong. For your efforts, you'll receive the Longclaw, a blue/support-type tool that increases the range of your Needle strikes.
