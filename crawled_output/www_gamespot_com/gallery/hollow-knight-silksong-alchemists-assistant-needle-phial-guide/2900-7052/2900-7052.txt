Take note of the locations for the Hollow Knight: Silksong Alchemist's Assistant quest.Zylotol is at the upper reaches to the left of the main shaft. Talk to him to start the quest proper.We've also marked the locations of Plasmium sources.Lastly, there's a boss named Plasmified Zango, who might be of some use when you're undertaking the next quest.How to extract Plasmium for the Alchemist's Assistant quest?Talking to Alchemist Zylotol lets you begin the Hollow Knight: Silksong Alchemist's Assistant quest. He'll give you a special tool known as the Needle Phial, so make sure you equip it by resting on a bench.Your goal now is to look for three buds with a bright blue glow (we've marked their locations in the previous map). Approach them and hold down the button prompt for the Needle Phial tool. Once fully charged, let go of the button and Hornet will extract a sample.Plasmium location #1 - In the large chamber directly below Zylotol's quarters.Plasmium location #2 - Near the exit that leads you back to Bonegrave.Plasmium location #3 - In the lower-left portion of the zone, which also happens to have a Memory Locket.How to get Plasmified Blood for the Advanced Alchemy quest?After obtaining 3x Plasmium, return to Alchemist Zylotol. He'll have another task for you called Advanced Alchemy. Your objective now is to collect 10x Plasmified Blood from enemies in the Wormways. Here are some tips:You still have to charge and use the Needle Phial to begin the extraction process. However, since you're dealing with enemies now, you need to be mindful of their attacks, movement, and positioning.You're probably better off targeting the smaller worms known as Plasmids. Some of the larger ones--i.e. Plasmidas--that cling to the ceiling can't be reached.There's a breakable wall near Plasmium location #3. It leads to a chamber where you can battle a boss named Plasmified Zango, who used to be Zylotol's assistant. Zango moves quite slowly and he has a basic ability where he belches out globules of plasma. He does gain a bit of speed depending on how much health he has left.You can repeatedly stab Plasmified Zango with the Needle Phial. Each successful extraction nets you a Plasmified Blood sample.Rewards from Alchemist ZylotolReturn to Alchemist Zylotol once you're done to receive more goodies:Completing the previous quest, Alchemist's Assistant, nets you the Plasmium Phial. You can use this red-type tool to gain a temporarily health pip that lasts for roughly five seconds.Completing Advanced Alchemy rewards you with the Plasmium Gland permanent item. It automatically replenishes Plasmium Phial charges whenever you rest on a bench.That does it for our guide on how to complete Alchemist's Assistant in Hollow Knight: Silksong. If you want to tackle other side quests in the game, we've got your back with our Great Taste of Pharloom guide and Broodfeast guide.Play as Hornet and brave the dangers of the Kingdom of Pharloom.
