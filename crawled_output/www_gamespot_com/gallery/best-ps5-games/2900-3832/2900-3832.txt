The game follows Alan Wake as he seeks to escape from the Dark Place, while a concurrent campaign follows FBI agent Saga Anderson. The twisting (and very meta) story lets both characters inform and illuminate one another, delivering a visually striking and eerie experience full of moments like you've never seen in a game.Read our Alan Wake 2 review.See at PlayStation StoreAssassin's Creed ShadowsAssassin's Creed Shadows finally makes good on the promise of a shinobi fantasy set in the Assassin's Creed universe. You play as two separate protagonists on their own quests--the shinobi Naoe who is seeking revenge, and the samurai Yasuke who was brought into a strange land. Eventually the two join forces, but the dual protagonist mechanic lets the play wildly differently. Naoe is the traditional stealthy assassin, while Yasuke is a heft armored samurai. Exploring the landscapes of Japan is a joy, especially as the game beautifully renders the changing of seasons in ways that can impact your approach.Read our Assassin's Creed Shadows review.See at AmazonAstro BotPlayStation mascot Astro had already debuted on PlayStation 5 with Astro's Playroom, a pre-installed tech demo that showed off the capabilities of the DualSense controller. In Astro Bot, the adorable little Sony mascot comes into its own with a full-fledged sequel that is also, as of now, the best-reviewed game of the year. Not only does Astro Bot squeeze technical wonder out of the PS5 capabilities, but it's also just a constantly surprising and impeccably well-crafted platformer that earns a place next to the very best the genre has to offer. It's a can't-miss on PS5, especially if you enjoyed the little taste from Astro's Playroom.See our Astro Bot review.See at AmazonBaldur's Gate 3Larian's masterpiece RPG is an incredible display of player agency and choice. The game replicates the Dungeons & Dragons experience like no other, giving you the freedom to approach scenarios in almost any way you can imagine, truly crafting your own tale as you engage with a multitude of memorable characters. It's mechanically complex but approachable, often beautiful to watch, and always gripping.Read our Baldur's Gate 3 review.See at PlayStation StoreBlue PrinceWhat if you inherited an old manor house, but it changed radically every time you entered it? That's the core premise of Blue Prince, one of this year's best-reviewed games. The first-person puzzle game has you exploring the Mount Holly house, with its ever-shifting layout that you help to draft as you goal. The primary goal is to reach the final room and earn your inheritance, but the house holds many mysteries that unfold beautifully as you make your way through.Read our Blue Prince review.See at PlayStation StoreCall of Duty: Black Ops 6The Call of Duty series has been among the top sellers for years, but some CoD games are clearly better than others. Black Ops 6 is a smart and varied action spectacle, and the best the series has been in some time. The 1990s paranoid thriller sets you on thrilling missions set against the backdrop of global events in the 1990s. On the multiplayer side, the new omni-movement makes matches feel fast and fluid, especially with the addition of inventive new maps that let you explore the space in a variety of ways. A revision to the perks system helps you specialize to fit your playstyle. Call of Duty has earned its reputation for a reason, and this latest release shows why.Read our Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 campaign review and multiplayer review.See at AmazonClair Obscur: Expedition 33Easily one of the biggest surprises of the year, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a harmonious fusion of turn-based JRPG gameplay and souls-like combat. The end result is a riveting gameplay experience full of fist-pumping moments of joy when you nail the timing on parries and dodges. The game also features a story that pulls no punches, thanks to an all-star cast flexing their dramatic muscles as they breathe life into a cast of lovable heroes and believable villains.Read our Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 review.Control: Ultimate EditionWhile Control was a great game when it launched in 2019, it had some issues with performance on PS4, especially on base models. With the power of the PS5, Control runs amazingly well. The particle physics really pop in 4K, and the performance is silky smooth. The Ultimate edition comes with both of Control’s expansions, which expand on a story that’s full of surprises and gripping performances. In Control, you play as Jesse Faden, the new director of the Federal Bureau of Control, a secretive agency that investigates supernatural events. Control’s combat is thrilling, with a great mix of standard third-person gunplay and abilities that ooze with style. The story is thought-provoking and, at times, mind-bending. It’s also elevated by a foreboding atmosphere and beautiful art style. If you missed out on Control the first time around, you can now play it in its ideal form on PS5.See our Control review.See at AmazonDeathloopDeathloop is set on Blackreef island, a strange place where the party never stops and everyone wants to kill our protagonist, Colt. The island is stuck in a time loop, and the only way to break it is by hunting down and killing a list of targets. Colt retains his memories from each loop but so do all of his targets. They know he's coming. Deathloop is an absolutely enthralling shooter that deftly weaves into systems into the loop in a coherent manner that gradually builds over time. It also tells a gripping tale and features some incredible acting. It earned a rare 10/10 in our review.See our Deathloop review.See at AmazonDestiny 2There's a reason the long-running Destiny 2 is the standard-bearer for live-service games. With rock-solid shooting mechanics, tons of customization options in both gameplay and cosmetics, and years of post-launch content with more on the way, the game has attracted and retained a large and devoted audience of Guardians. Plus, Destiny 2 is free to download, allowing you to play a decent chunk of story content as well as competitive multiplayer without spending a dime. Destiny 2 also happens to look incredible in 4K on PS5.See our Destiny 2: The Final Shape review.See at PlayStation StoreDevil May Cry 5: Special EditionA fast-paced action game with stylish combat is the perfect candidate for a PS5 upgrade. Enter Devil May Cry 5 Special edition, the definitive console version of Capcom’s 2019 action game. DMC 5 Special edition is impressive from a technical perspective and offers three different graphics and performance settings that offer different combinations of improvements such as ray-tracing, 4K resolution, or even gameplay at up to 120fps. It also comes with the Vergil DLC, which lets you play through the game as Dante’s twin brother. Two new modes are included as well: Turbo and Legendary Dark Knight. Turbo speeds the game up, while Legendary Dark Knight adds more enemies to the fight. Overall, the technical improvements and new content make DMC 5 Special Edition worth playing even if you already beat the original on PS4. It’s one of the best action games in recent years and includes one of the deepest combo systems ever in the genre.See our Devil May Cry 5 review.See at AmazonDiablo 4: Vessel of HatredDiablo 4 was already a well-crafted dungeon-crawling RPG, but it got a whole lot bigger with the addition of its first major expansion, Vessel of Hatred. The expansion adds a lengthy new story chapter picking up right where the main campaign left off, detailing the creeping influence of Mephisto. While the expansion comes alongside a host of changes and improvements to the core game and leveling structure, many of them available to all players with or without the expansion, the major centerpiece of Vessel of Hatred is the new Spiritborn class. The powerful new melee class focuses on swift strikes that smoothly combo into each other, from a variety of disciplines that can be mixed-and-matched.See our Diablo 4 review and Vessel of Hatred review.See at AmazonDoom: The Dark AgesThree games in, id Software's reborn Doom series continues to surprise. Gone are the days of the Doom Slayer being a highly acrobatic killer of demons, as The Dark Ages keeps the action grounded and focused with hard-hitting offense. The prequel to 2016's Doom wants you to make a glorious stand whenever you face the hordes of Hell, and with the tools it gives you, ripping and tearing through demons feels better than ever.Read our Doom: The Dark Ages review.See at AmazonElden Ring: Shadow of the ErdtreeElden Ring was the runaway hit of 2022 and our Game of the Year. We've been patiently awaiting the promised Shadow of the Erdtree expansion, and this year From Soft delivered in a big way. The DLC provides a massive new area to explore, dense with secrets to uncover and new challenges to overcome. The smart balancing system lets you experience the feeling of progression even with your most overpowered build, and it deepens and expands upon the beloved Elden Ring lore in rich, sometimes shocking ways.Read our Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree review.See on AmazonThe Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion RemasteredOblivion is an odd game to remaster. It's admittedly a rough diamond, caught between two distinct eras of The Elder Scrolls games and full of "quirky" gameplay issues, but that's what makes it so charming in the first place. Bethesda Game Studios and Virtuos Studios knew this as well, as the studios seemingly managed the impossible: Overhaul Oblivion without losing any of its essence. The results speak for themselves, because Oblivion Remastered is a bridge to the past that is worth crossing thanks to its modern enhancements.Read our The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered review.Final Fantasy VII Remake: IntergradeFinal Fantasy VII Remake earned a rare 10/10 from GameSpot for its exhilarating and strategic combat, charming characters, stunning depiction of Midgar, and the ways it stands on its own apart from the original. Its PS5 version, sold as Final Fantasy VII Remake: Intergrade, majorly upgrades the game's graphics and performance with next-gen power, offering two modes: one that lets you play the game in 4K with a lower frame rate, while the other prioritizes running the game in 60fps with sacrificing some graphical improvements. Notably, Intergrade also includes the Intermission DLC, which features a new story starring the lovable ninja Yuffie, adds new side missions and the Fort Condor minigame, and helps flesh out the wider FF7 universe. Whether you already own and played FF7 Remake on PS4 (in which case you can upgrade your game to the PS5 version for free) or are jumping in for the first time, Intergrade is the definitive version of a must-play adventure.See our Final Fantasy VII Remake: Intergrade review.See at AmazonFinal Fantasy VII RebirthFinal Fantasy VII Remake impressed us with how it rethought the very structure of what a classic game remake could be. The second in the planned trilogy, Rebirth, expands its scope outside the steampunk city of Midgar and into a lush open world, giving you no shortage of activities and minigames to occupy your time as you pursue the deadly Sephiroth. While this middle chapter loses some of the focus of its predecessor, it makes up for it by further polishing the already tightly designed combat, introducing a wide cast of new and familiar faces, and deepening the mysteries at the heart of the remake trilogy. Plus, we just can't get enough Queen's Blood, the new card game that's so good it could stand on its own as a separate release.See our Final Fantasy VII Rebirth review.See at AmazonGhost of TsushimaGhost of Tsushima was the last major exclusive to release on PS4 and made the most of the hardware since it already looked incredible and ran extremely well. The free PS5 upgrade makes the details of Tsushima’s lush open world even more rich and expressive. If you missed out on Ghost of Tsushima at the end of the PS4’s lifecycle, the upgrade, which supports gameplay at 60fps and 4K resolution, makes it look and feel like a native PS5 game. You play as Jin Sakai, a samurai who barely staves off a violent death and sets off on an adventure to thwart the first Mongol invasion of Japan. Ghost of Tsushima has great, fluid combat and well-integrated stealth mechanics. The open-world quest structure does feel fairly familiar, but all of the other aspects make it worth the occasional repetition.Outside of the campaign, there’s a surprisingly awesome co-op multiplayer mode dubbed Legends that adds numerous new layers to an already-great game. You can also opt for the Director's Cut, which includes a brand-new story expansion that adds to the overall narrative.See our Ghost of Tsushima review.See at AmazonGod of War / God of War RagnarokGod of War is one of the most stunning PS4 games, and it is even prettier on PS5. The PS5 update adds a performance mode with 4K resolution that runs at 60fps. God of War is one of the best PlayStation exclusives in a long time already, so it’s definitely worth revisiting or playing for the first time on PS5 if you haven't yet. Its sequel, God of War Ragnarok, is a massive expansion of the concept and a continuation of the story. It's just as visually outstanding, while refining the already stellar combat and giving you new tools and RPG-like features to help you make the combat your own. It also continues, and possibly concludes, the apocalyptic story that the first game began, making these two a perfect duology to experience on your PS5.See our God of War Ragnarok review.See at AmazonGran Turismo 7Though it doesn't have much competition, Gran Turismo 7 is the best racing game on PlayStation 5 so far. That's probably not much of surprise considering the franchise's pedigree, but it's wonderful to experience a return to form for the iconic Gran Turismo brand. As hard as it is to believe, it's been more than eight years since the release of Gran Turismo 6. GT 7 ushers the series into a new, stunning era thanks to the PS5's powerful hardware. Gran Turismo 7 has top-notch car handling, a wide variety of single-player content, and heaps of customization that will undoubtedly make car enthusiasts happy. With more than 30 tracks and 400 cars, Gran Turismo 7 has a lot to offer at launch. If you get one racing game on PS5, it should be Gran Turismo 7.See our Gran Turismo 7 review.See at AmazonHadesHades is a roguelike that could make you fall in love with the genre. In Hades, you play as Zagreus, the god of rebirth. Your goal is to escape from the underworld, but it won't be easy. Played from an isometric perspective, Hades has fast-paced and challenging combat that relies both on nimble fingers and strategic forethought. Between each run through the enemy-laden rooms, Hades compelling tale filled with interesting gods and goddesses unfolds. With plenty of room for experimentation and a structure that rewards you for sticking with it, Hades is an immensely satisfying action game.See our Hades review.See at AmazonHitman: World of AssassinationIO Interactive’s Hitman reboot trilogy has proven to be one of the most inventive and interesting stealth-action series ever made. Hitman 3 caps off the World of Assassination trilogy on an all-time high note for the franchise as a whole. The hallmark of the trilogy has been player choice in intricate sandbox-style levels, and that is readily on display in Hitman 3, giving players a dizzying number of ways to tackle objectives as Agent 47. Brilliant level design is complemented by lively characters who draw you into this mesmerizing and often absurd world. Hitman 3 also places a greater emphasis on its story, which trickles down to the atmosphere to create a campaign that feels more consequential. With the "World of Assassination" update, you can play through all three games of content along with the engaging roguelike Freelancer mode.See our Hitman 3 review.See at AmazonHorizon Forbidden WestHorizon Forbidden West is an excellent demonstration of the power of the PS5. Arguably the most beautiful open-world game ever made, Horizon Forbidden West is a visual triumph whether you're playing in performance or graphics modes. Aloy's second adventure takes place after the events of Zero Dawn, with the heroine on a new quest to unearth answers to the past in order to save the future of the world. Horizon Forbidden West has a nice mix of stealth and action-oriented combat when it comes to the signature machines (robot dinosaurs). If you're looking for a gorgeous open-world game with near endless activities, Horizon Forbidden West is bursting at the seams with content. The main quests are the stars of the show, but there are a bunch of compelling sidequests that encourage players to explore. While there might actually be too many systems in Forbidden West, those who like these sorts of open-world games will undoubtedly appreciate how much there is to see and do.See our Horizon Forbidden West review.See at AmazonKingdom Come: Deliverance 2The historical epic RPG Kingdom Come: Deliverance was a surprise hit in 2018, and now its sequel has come to expand upon the world. This is a role-playing game with an emphasis on actually playing a role, as both the combat and conversation systems are rich with layers to explore and craft your own path through the world. The combat has been streamlined and feels more fluid, but not at the expense of its predecessor's depth. And the quests are well-written and draw you deeper into the world.Read our Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 review.See on AmazonKunitsu-Gami: Path of the GoddessCapcom has had a string of wins with its established franchises, recently releasing a steady stream of well-received new games like Street Fighter 6 alongside remakes like Resident Evil 4. Kunitsu-Gami shows the publisher hasn't lost its step for new franchises, producing an inventive blend of demon-slaying action and tower defense strategy that each feel intense and satisfying in their own ways, and especially combined together. Inspired by Japanese folklore, you need to constantly balance purging the demons, rescuing villagers, and building traps. It's a lot to manage, but spinning these plates simultaneously creates a compelling gameplay loop that's hard to put down.Read our Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess review.See at PlayStation StoreMarvel's Spider-Man 2Following the blockbuster success of the first Spider-Man game from Insomniac and its interstitial sequel Miles Morales, Marvel's Spider-Man 2 lets the two Spider-Men join forces in a sprawling and gorgeously rendered New York City. The two are come face to face with Kraven the Hunter, who has come to New York targeting Spidey's rogues gallery. The dual protagonists lets you play with two sets of powers, while the cinematic story is a treat for long-time web-heads.Read our Spider-Man 2 review.See at AmazonMetaphor: ReFantazioPersona series director Katsura Hashino has returned with his first new game since 2016, and it's a fantastic one. Metaphor: ReFantazio is similar structurally to the Persona series, but it features a new original storyline set in a fantasy world, and a wide array of characters to find and classes to unlock. The turn-based RPG combat unfolds beautifully into deep layers of strategy, and the story is an affecting meditation on the power of storytelling. Metaphor: ReFantazio is one of the few games in our history to earn a 10/10 review.Read our Metaphor: ReFantazio review.See at AmazonMLB The Show 25The annual baseball season means a new MLB game, and this year's MLB The Show 25 is the best it's been in years. A revised progression system makes Road to the Show better than it's been in years, and this iteration makes significant tweaks to the defensive and free agent systems. The Storylines mode remains a standout, delivering another season of the Negro Leagues story, albeit without a new individual story to set it apart. All in all there's a reason The Show has gained a reputation as a premiere annual sports franchise and this year's doesn't disappoint.Read our MLB The Show 25 review.See at AmazonMonster Hunter WildsMonster Hunter Wilds takes the basic framework we've come to know and expect and improves it in numerous ways. The new style of open world allows you to seamlessly move back and forth from the village where you'll organize hunts to the actual area where you'll engage in combat. The core loop of hunting and crafting new gear remains as engaging as ever, and it's made all the better when played online with friends. Capcom has sanded off some of the edges--making for a simpler experience overall, but one that is still not especially welcoming to newcomers. What's here is still a very deep action-RPG you can spend countless hours with, and the urge to go on just one more hunt remains as strong as ever.See at AmazonNo Man's SkyNo game had a better comeback story last generation than No Man’s Sky, the ambitious space-exploration sim from Hello Games that originally launched to mixed reception in 2016. In the years since, Hello Games has changed the narrative from unfulfilled promises to exceeding expectations. From adding a bevy of new features like base-building and space fleet management to introducing entirely new ways to play thanks to multiplayer, No Man’s Sky has become a wonderful experience. On PS5, No Man’s Sky runs in 4K at 60fps, has more detailed planets, and features better lighting and shadows. For a game that focuses on exploration and discovery, No Man’s Sky’s visual and technical improvements make it an even worthier voyage across space.See our No Man's Sky Next review.See at AmazonPrince of Persia: The Lost Crown2024 opened with a pleasant surprise, as the classic and influential platforming series Prince of Persia returned as a metroidvania. The mysterious Mount Qaf is a perfect setting for an exploration-focused adventure, with biomes ranging from a royal library to a dank catacombs. Combat is tight and focused, with enough depth and nuance in its parry and counter system to provide a satisfying challenge, and flexible difficulty options to let players of almost any skill level feel appropriately tested.What stands out most about The Lost Crown, though, is its array of thoughtful metroidvania choices. Subtle visual cues and smart map options make it clear that this was a labor of love from fans of the genre, and the result is a new leader in the space. Expect to see other metroidvanias following the Prince's lead.Read our Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown review.See at WalmartRatchet & Clank: Rift ApartA PS5 exclusive, Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart is a thrilling adventure in the action-platforming series, and it looks and feels incredible on next-gen hardware. Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart introduces a lovable new character, Rivet, who teams up with the iconic duo after they're thrust into an alternate dimension. With gorgeous visuals, immersive DualSense functionality, and new traversal tools that refine platforming and combat, Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart was one of the first games that felt truly "next-gen" and is a must-play for any PS5 owners.See our Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart review.See at AmazonResident Evil 4Resident Evil 4 is one of the most revered third-person action games of all time, and one that helped set the standard for years to come. Capcom's decision to remake the classic couldn't have come lightly, but the studio pulled off the feat with aplomb and met the understandably high expectations. The remake of Resident Evil 4 is not just a significant visual improvement over the original. It's a thoughtful reimagining of the best parts of RE4, and a reinvention of the pieces that were less successful. The result is a game that is both recognizable and fresh, paying homage to a fantastic game and making it feel utterly modern in the process.See our Resident Evil 4 review.See at AmazonReturnalReturnal is not a game for everyone--it's extremely difficult and its roguelite structure can feel overwhelming at first--but those who keep playing will be rewarded with one of Housemarque's best games. Essentially a AAA-level third-person shooter with arcade sensibilities, it retains the essence of Housemarque's older, smaller games like Nex Machina and Resogun, with dodging through enemy projectiles and memorizing their attacks playing a huge role. But on top of this is a surprisingly deep story focused on an astronaut named Selene and a planet that she just can't seem to escape, even in death. Shortcuts and a little bit of luck can make the run between the game's six different biomes much less daunting, and little tidbits of exposition and world-building make even your failed runs feel worthwhile. And that's good, because you're likely going to have a lot of them before you see the ending.See our Returnal review.See at AmazonSilent Hill 2A remake of one of the most celebrated and influential survival horror games of all time, Silent Hill 2 had a daunting task, which Bloober Team handled with aplomb. The remake is a haunting thrill ride, featuring tense combat that has been reimagined for the new perspective, more wide-open atmospheres that don't compromise the original's atmosphere, and great creepy sound design that enhances the experience. By reverently keeping the things that worked best about the original while carefully updating certain aspects for modern audiences, this is a great way to experience Silent Hill 2 again, or for the first time.Read our Silent Hill 2 review.See at AmazonShin Megami Tensei V: VengeanceAfter debuting on Nintendo Switch, Shin Megami Tensei V has come to other platforms as SMT V: Vengeance. This enhanced port addresses feedback from the original release with new features, like better navigation tools. But the real draw of any Shin Megami Tensei game is its story and characters, which have gotten a major update with loads of new story content to enhance your relationships with human and demons alike, including some real surprises for returning players.See our Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance review.See on AmazonSplit FictionHazelight has made a name for itself as the premiere cooperative game studio, and Split Fiction is just the latest display why it's earned the title. The platform action game follows the story of two aspiring writers--one sci-fi author and one fantasy author--whose worlds are smashed together by a high-tech firm. What makes Split Fiction stand out is Hazelight's characteristic inventiveness, consistently surprising the players with new challenges that test their cooperative prowess.Read our Split Fiction review.See at AmazonStreet Fighter 6Street Fighter 5 was a divisive part of the long-running fighting franchise, and clearly Capcom intended Street Fighter 6 to be a reset. It appears to be mission accomplished, as the latest game is getting praise across the board for being an excellent entry for fighting game veterans as well as a great entry point for those who have had trouble penetrating the scene. A newly refined combo system also helps novices learn not just how to pull off complicated moves, but also the strategy behind when and why to do it. Perhaps the wildest revision is a new World Tour mode, which has you create a custom fighter with their own blend of moves that you learn from several masters--famous Street Fighter characters like Ken and Chun-Li. And the fighters themselves are a diverse set of strange and inventive new characters alongside classic faces like Blanka and Dhalsim. It all comes together to be the best Street Fighter package in years.See our Street Fighter 6 review.See at AmazonSunderfolkSunderfolk isn't a game we'd recommend you play on your lonesome, but gather a few friends and you're in for a magical ride. It's a digital board game for fans of tabletop adventures, one that is incredibly fun once you dive into its world, lore, and gameplay that rewards you for being a team player.Read our Sunderfolk review.The Talos Principle 2The philosophical first-person puzzler The Talos Principle demanded a sequel as ambitious and heady as it was, and the second game delivers. Talos Principle 2 is once again a contemplative experience that raises big questions even as you stay occupied with a series of clever puzzles. You'll explore deep existential questions and unravel the nature of the world. The first game was an unexpected treat but The Talos Principle 2 shows that developer Croteam can still create a delightful puzzle box even when we think we know what to expect.Read our The Talos Principle 2 review.See at PlayStation StoreWarhammer 40,000 Space Marine 2The cult classic Space Marine has finally received a sequel more than a decade later, and it's just what fans have been waiting for. The new game retains its predecessor's brutal and bloody action, but with refinements that make it feel more fluid and tactile. It uses the Warhammer tabletop license to great effect with excellent world-building and an overwhelming sense of scale, but its crunchy combat should appeal to those who have never delved deep into the franchise as well.Read our Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine 2 review.See at AmazonYakuza: Like a DragonYakuza: Like a Dragon's PS5 version supports native 4K resolution or 60fps with a slight dip in resolution. Like a Dragon is the most experimental entry in the beloved Sega series. With a charming new protagonist, Ichiban Kasuga, and an inspired turn-based battle system, Yakuza: Like a Dragon takes the series in a whole new direction. Still, it retains all of the endearing quirks that Yakuza is known for, which makes Like a Dragon a great experience for longtime fans and newcomers alike. Along with its incredible mainline story, Like a Dragon has a ton of awesome side content that makes seeing and doing everything in its beautiful world a worthwhile endeavor. It's worth noting that while the PS4 version has a free upgrade to PS5, save data doesn't transfer.See our Yakuza: Like a Dragon review.See at AmazonTony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4Pulling off sick tricks, defying gravity, and grabbing a few collectibles along the way were hallmarks of the Tony Hawk Pro Skater franchise, and this remaster of the best games in the series matches the quality of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2. While the changes to Tony Hawk Pro Skater 4 might be disappointing to fans of the original, you're still getting a slick remaster full of iconic locales to revisit, familiar faces to jog your memory, and gameplay that'll reawaken your skateboarding muscle memory.Read our Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 review.See at AmazonRematchEA has pretty much ruled the roost when it comes to soccer games, but Rematch is here and more than ready to give the company a few sleepless nights. Developed by the same studio behind the martial arts epic Sifu, Rematch mixes arcade action with authentic soccer gameplay to create a thrilling experience. The only thing that matters on this level playing field is your skill, the ability to change tactics on the fly, and trusting your teammates.Read our Rematch review.See on the PlayStation StoreDeath Stranding 2: On the BeachYears in the making, Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is legendary developer Hideo Kojima at his best. It's a wonderfully weird and masterfully crafted post-apocalyptic adventure that's stuffed with small details to savor and substantially improved gameplay. Death Stranding 2 is also a surprisingly sincere experience, one full of moments of subtle reflection from a developer at the top of his game.Read our Death Stranding 2: On the Beach review.See at Amazon
