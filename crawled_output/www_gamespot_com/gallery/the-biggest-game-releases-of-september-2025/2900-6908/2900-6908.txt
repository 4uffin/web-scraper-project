Green Day typically takes a month-long nap during September, which is a terrible idea because the band is missing out on some truly terrific game releases this month. With the finish line for the year drawing closer, September is typically a month when several big games are released.This year is no different, as we're looking at a stack of games from across a varied selection of genres, like looter-shooter action with Borderlands 4, survival-horror in Silent Hill F, and some strategic fun in Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles. Of course, these games are also arriving in and around one of the most highly anticipated games of recent memory, Hollow Knight: Silksong.On top of that, smaller titles are releasing this month that are also vying for your attention, like Jetrunner, Hirogami, and Slime Rancher 2. Overall, expect to be spoiled for choice in September. You can see all our picks for the biggest releases below, and for a closer look at the rest of the year, you can check out 2025's upcoming game release dates.Share this GalleryLatest Image GalleriesHades 2 - All Keepsakes And How To Unlock ThemHades 2 - How To Unlock Animal Familiars And PetsHades 2 Arcana Guide And The Best Arcana Cards To UseHirogamiRelease date: September 3Platforms: PC, PS5A 3D platformer inspired by the art of Origami, Hirogami will see players take on animal forms to explore the mystical landscape and solve puzzles so that they can save the realm. Every problem has a solution, whether it be beating enemies to a pulp or transforming the protagonist of Hiro into a paper plane to make use of air currents; success is just a few folds away.See on SteamIndiana Jones and the Great Circle: The Order of GiantsRelease date: September 4Platforms: PC. Xbox Series X|S, PS5Indiana Jones and the Great Circle was one of last year's best games--or really brilliant this year, if you're on PS5--and its first expansion takes Dr. Jones to the streets of Rome. Between forgotten catacombs, a dangerous cult, and a sinister mystery revolving around the dark legacy of the Nephilim giants, it looks like the famed archeologist has his work cut out for him in his latest adventure.Star Wars OutlawsRelease date: September 4Platforms: Switch 2Speaking of things related to Lucasfilm, Star Wars Outlaws makes its grand debut on Switch 2 this month. Released last year for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, the game follows scoundrel Kay Vess as she gets tangled up with dangerous underworld factions, the Empire, and situations that require a shoot-first mentality. This version of the game also includes the two DLC expansions and several Switch 2 exclusive gameplay features.Star Wars Outlaws: Gold Edition$60 | Releases September 4Preorder on AmazonPreorder on WalmartKejoraRelease date: September 4Platforms: PCWhat if Studio Ghibli made a Groundhog Day-esque animated movie? Then you'd have a pretty good idea of what to expect from Kejora, a beautifully illustrated puzzle-platformer adventure game in which a group of kids have to figure out why their village is repeating the same day over and over again.See on SteamVoid CrewRelease date: September 4Platforms: PS5, Xbox Series X|SAfter two years in Steam Early Access, Void Crew is finally ready for its full 1.0 release. A co-op game set in the far reaches of space, players will have to team up to run a spaceship and embark on cosmic adventures. Up to six players can take part, with pilots, gunners, and maintenance being some of the roles that team members will be assigned to. Developer Hutlihut Games says that players can also expect flexible gameplay to help teams find a path to success that suits their preferred style of play.See on SteamJetrunnerRelease date: September 4Platforms: PCBilled as Trackmania meets Titanfall, Jetrunner is a parkour-focused FPS where gravity is optional and style is mandatory. The game features dozens of arenas scattered across the globe for rookie sensation Nina White to blaze through as she aims for the top of the Jetrunning leaderboards, and with an arsenal of gadgets and preparation, players can compete to be the best of the best.See on SteamHollow Knight: SilksongRelease date: September 4Platforms: PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Switch 2, SwitchSix years after it was first announced, Hollow Knight: Silksong is finally landing on PC and consoles this month. Team Cherry's follow-up to the acclaimed 2017 metroidvania Hollow Knight has been one of the most highly anticipated games of recent years, with the studio confirming its release date after years of silence. Since the announcement was made, Hollow Knight has gotten a nice bump on Steam as fans brush up on their skills, and we're already seeing multiple game delays as several studios are opting to avoid being caught in Silksong's wake.See on SteamHell Is UsRelease date: September 4Platforms: PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|SHell Is Us might just be thetime-sink action-RPG of 2025, because this game demands your undivided attention. There's no hand-holding at all here for this exploration-focused game, as you'll need to gather clues and strike up a conversation to figure out where to go. That's an intriguing design choice with some deliberately bold ideas at its core, and if you're curious to see what developer Rogue Factor has been cooking up, you can try out a demo for Hell Is Us right now.Hell Is Us$60 | Releases September 4Preorder at AmazonPreorder at WalmartPreorder at GameStopHell Is Us: Deluxe Edition for PS5$80 | Releases September 1Preorder at AmazonPreorder at WalmartCronos: The New DawnRelease date: September 5Platforms: PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch 2Bloober Team earned critical acclaim last year for its Silent Hill 2 remake, and this year, the studio is looking to put its own stamp on a spiritual successor to Dead Space. Mixing horror with time travel, Cronos: The New Dawn is set in a futuristic version of Eastern Europe where an event known as The Change has radically altered the region. As the Traveler, players will travel back to 1980s Poland so they can rescue key people from the past. All kinds of gruesome monsters stand in their way, and these creatures also possess the ability to incorporate the remains of their brethren into them so that they can rapidly evolve into even deadlier threats.Cronos: The New Dawn Standard Edition$60 | Releases September 5Preorder at AmazonPreorder at WalmartPreorder at Best BuyCronos: The New Dawn Deluxe Edition$70 | Releases September 3Preorder at PlayStation StorePreorder at Xbox StorePreorder at SteamEverybody's Golf: Hot ShotsRelease date: September 5Platforms: PC, PS5, SwitchAlmost a decade has passed since the last installment in this popular golf game was released, but at long last, you can tee up for 18 rounds of casual fun. Everybody's Golf: Hot Shots combines easy-to-learn gameplay with cartoonish visuals, and it's also the first game in the series to launch on PC and Nintendo platforms.Everybody's Golf Hot Shots (PC)$33.59 (was $40)Preorder at FanaticalDaemon X Machina: Titanic ScionRelease date: September 5Platforms: PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch 2The first Daemon X Machina game played like a spiritual successor to From Software's Armored Core, and for its first sequel, it looks like we're getting a game that channels the spirit of BioWare's Anthem, but in a good way. The shift to a smaller mechanized pilot inside of a bleeding-edge suit allows for some interesting new gameplay systems, and it'll be interesting to see just how deep the mechanized rabbit hole is when Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion flies into action.Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion Standard Edition$70 | Releases September 5Preorder at AmazonPreorder at WalmartPreorder at TargetPreorder at Best BuyPreorder at GameStopDaemon X Machina: Titanic Scion Limited Edition$100 | Releases September 5Preorder at AmazonPreorder at WalmartPreorder at TargetPreorder at Best BuyPreorder at GameStopNBA 2K26Release date: September 5Platforms: PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Switch 2Another year, another reason to hit the digital courts with NBA 2K26. The franchise is a consistent best-seller with each annual release, and this year, 2K is looking to attract players with a massive overhaul to its ProPlay animation system alongside several other tweaks designed to make the game look and feel more realistic than ever before. 2K is also promising new and revamped controls, with these changes aimed at rewarding players who can bring skillful gameplay and fast decision-making to each match.NBA 2K26 Standard + WNBA Editions$70See at AmazonSee at Best BuySee at GameStop (WNBA)NBA 2K26 Superstar Edition$100See at PS StoreSee at Xbox StoreSee at SteamNBA 2K26 Leave No Doubt Edition$150See at PS StoreSee at Xbox StoreSee at SteamGarfield Kart 2: All You Can DriftRelease date: September 10Platforms: PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, SwitchSeptember is already looking more stuffed than a double-thick serving of lasagna, and fittingly, you can also expect Garfield to rock up to the party in September. The third-best cartoon strip cat--behind Heathcliff and Hobbes--Garfield's planning to tear up some asphalt in a new racing game that features him and all of the other popular characters from the eternal cartoon strip--and Jon Arbuckle. Between this and Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds, September is looking like a great month for racing fans who want to see anthropomorphic animals with a need for speed.See on SteamBorderlands 4Release date: September 12Platforms: PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|SThe loot-and-shoot formula of Borderlands is still a captivating draw to the series, and with Gearbox claiming that Borderlands 4 has an obscene number of weapons to collect, we're expecting to spend a lot of time hunting after an elusive firearm or two. Borderlands 4 also looks set to introduce some interesting upgrades to its gameplay, as prospective Vault Hunters will be gliding, double-jumping, and jetting about a world full of secrets and loot when it lands on PC and console.Borderlands 4 Standard Edition$70 | Releases September 12Preorder at AmazonPreorder at WalmartPreorder at Best BuyPreorder at TargetPreorder at GameStopBorderlands 4 Super Deluxe Edition$130 | Releases September 12Preorder at AmazonPreorder at WalmartPreorder at GameStopPreorder at Best BuyPreorder at TargetBorderlands 4 Echo-4 Bundle$150 | Exclusive to GameStopPreorder at GameStopNHL 26Release date: September 12Platforms: PS5, Xbox Series X|SSeptember is shaping up to be a great month for sports fans, as you can hit the ice in NHL 26 and experience the next evolution of EA's popular ice hockey series. This year's edition includes new gameplay changes and updated movement using the ICE-Q 2.0 tech, as well as a reworked Be A Pro mode, new HUT Seasons, and team-building mechanics. All that, and an expansive roster of officially licensed teams, players, and leagues.EA Sports NHL 26 Standard Edition$70 | September 12Preorder at AmazonPreorder at WalmartPreorder at Best BuyEA Sports NHL 26 Deluxe Edition$100 | Releases September 5Preorder at PS StorePreorder at Xbox StoreLego VoyagersRelease date: September 15Platforms: PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, SwitchWhile it's sadly not a Lego take on the best Star Trek TV series, Lego Voyagers does look like a cute co-op adventure game. As a pair of single-stud bricks embarking on a lengthy journey, players will need to overcome obstacles and puzzles by teaming up and building their way forward. Not only does Lego Voyagers look like a fun game, but also the perfect co-op game for parents and children to enjoy.See on SteamHenry HalfheadRelease date: September 16Platforms: PCSay hello to Henry, who is literally just half a head. Fortunately, they're the top part of a disembodied head that has functioning eyes, ears, and a nose, and they'll have to use their ability to become any object within reach to help them get through everyday life. Every object has unique properties and abilities, and combining them will help Henry get through their day in this wholesome adventure.See on SteamSkateRelease date: September 16Platforms: PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox OneThe skateboarding genre has been enjoying a renaissance in the 2020s, and finally, EA's Skate franchise is making a comeback. The first Skate game in 15 years, the reboot launches in early access for PC, PlayStation, and Xbox this month. Several core elements are getting a modern touch--like the flick-it controls--and Skate is launching as a free-to-play live-service game that will evolve over time as players explore the skateboarding sandbox.See on SteamFrostpunk 2Release date: September 18Platforms: PS5, Xbox Series X|SThe first Frostpunk game was one of those rare real-time strategy games that worked surprisingly well on console, thanks to developer 11 Bit Studios coming up with intuitive controls, and we're hoping to see history repeat itself when Frostpunk 2 launches for Xbox Series X|S and PS5. If you missed it when it first came out on PC, Frostpunk 2 evolved the eternal winter formula of its predecessor, as it tasked players with making tough choices to keep the fires burning and humanity alive in a harsh world. Xbox players will be able to check out the game as a day-one launch through Game Pass.Dying Light: The BeastRelease date: September 19Platforms: PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|SAfter a short delay, Dying Light: The Beast is finally out this month. A spin-off from the main series that sees Kyle Crane--the protagonist of the original Dying Light--return, this new game put an interesting spin on the fight-or-flight mechanics of the previous two games by giving you rage-fueled powers that can be used to viciously tear through mobs of zombies. The end result is an ultraviolent power-up, but since it's temporary, you'll still need to sharpen your parkour skills when you're not drop-kicking or blasting away at enemies.See on SteamTrails in the Sky 1st ChapterRelease date: September 19Platforms: PC, Switch 2, SwitchThe Trails series has been running for over 20 years now, and in 2025, players can return to the roots of this JRPG franchise with Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter. A complete remake of the 2004 game, the game offers 3D visuals, new voice acting, turn-based and real-time battle systems, and plenty of new content. If you never played the game, Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter follows the siblings Joshua and Estelle Bright, members of the Bracers peacekeeping organization, who find themselves caught up in an international conspiracy that threatens to destabilize the world.See on AmazonJump SpaceRelease date: September 19Platforms: PC, Xbox Series X|SOriginally titled Jump Ship, developer Keepsake Games renamed the game to Jump Space in August. The game arrives next month in Steam Early Access, and it looks like a fusion of Left 4 Dead and Sea of Thieves with a sci-fi theme. Purely PvE, players can explore the cosmos from the relative safety of their spaceship or touch down on alien worlds to get up close and personal with enemies.See on SteamEndless Legend 2Release date: September 22Platforms: PCFans of 4X strategy games are spoiled for choice these days, and you can add Endless Legend 2 to that turn-based buffet. Set in a fantasy realm, players can lead various factions, build empires, and wage wars that span entire planets as they secure their legacy. There are diplomatic solutions to avoid needless bloodshed, but it's up to you to decide what kind of mark you want to leave on history. The game will also be coming to the Microsoft Store and PC Game Pass via Game Preview.See on SteamBaby StepsRelease date: September 23Platforms: PC, PS5Many games have been derogatively referred to as glorified walking simulators over the years, but that's a label that Baby Steps wears with pride. A game that tells the story of Nate--one awkwardly placed footstep at a time--Baby Steps is all about climbing a proverbial and literal mountain while dressed in a onesie that's bound to get increasingly dirty as you go along this ambitious journey. Developed by an all-star crew of people that includes Bennett Foddy (Getting Over It), Gabe Cuzzillo (Ape Out), and Maxi Boch, Baby Steps looks like it could be a hilarious and inspiring tale of putting your best foot forward.See on SteamSlime Rancher 2Release date: September 23Platforms: PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|SOh yes, it's slime time. A sequel to the quirky 2017 game, Slime Rancher 2 continues the story of Beatrix LeBeau and the Far Far Range as she works to build the greatest slime farm in the galaxy. It first launched in Steam Early Access back in 2022, and since then, developer Monomi Park has worked to make the game bigger, look better, and add more slimes to wrangle.See on SteamAgatha Christie: Death on the NileRelease date: September 23Platforms: PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, SwitchWhile the big-screen adaptation of Agatha Christie's classic detective story Death on the Nile gave birth to a fantastic meme--enough champagne to fill the Nile--this video game version of the famous whodunnit looks like it'll put a groovy spin on it. Set in the '70s, detectives Hercule Poirot and Jane Royce have their work cut out for them as they work to solve seemingly unrelated cases full of twists and turns. The big twist here is that the story continues after the book ends, ensuring a few surprises for Christie fans and newcomers alike.See on SteamSilent Hill FRelease date: September 25Platforms: PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|SThe last couple of years have seen Silent Hill come back in a big way, and hot on the heels of last year's incredible Silent Hill 2 remake, Konami is looking to unleash a chilling new chapter in its psychological-horror franchise. For the first time, the action takes place far away from the titular town of Silent Hill, as players will instead explore a spooky slice of rural Japan that has been invaded by horrific creatures based on ancient myths and monsters. Not only does this put a fresh new spin on the series, but the new combat gameplay also has the potential to make this one of the best Silent Hill games yet.Silent Hill f Day One Edition (Amazon Exclusive)$70 | Releases September 25See at AmazonSilent Hill f Physical Edition (PS5, Xbox Series X)$70 | Releases September 25Preorder at WalmartPreorder at Best BuyPreorder at TargetPreorder at GameStopSilent Hill f Digital Deluxe Edition$60 (was $80) for PC | $80 for ConsolePreorder at FanaticalPreorder at PSNPreorder at Xbox StoreSonic Racing: CrossworldsRelease date: September 25Platforms: PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, SwitchSure, Sonic might be fleet of foot, but some of his best spin-off adventures have seen him put the pedal to the metal in racing games. Sonic Racing: Crossworlds sees Sega's mascot race across land, sea, and air against his friends and foes, as well as a few crossover characters from the Persona series and--we kid you not--SpongeBob Squarepants. How can SpongeBob race against Sonic when he doesn't even have a driver's license? Remember, you don't need a license to drive a sandwich. The game looks gorgeous in action--and it's mechanically solid--but we're also worried that it's a little too much like other kart racers on the market right now.Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds for PS5 / Xbox Series X$70 | Released September 25See at AmazonSee at WalmartSee at Best BuySee at TargetSonic Racing: CrossWorlds for Nintendo Switch$60 | Upgrade to Switch 2 for $10See at AmazonSee at WalmartSee at Best BuySee at TargetAtelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist & the White GuardianRelease date: September 25Platforms: PC, PS5, PS4, SwitchThe Atelier series has become one of the best JRPG franchises over recent years, especially if you're in the mood for something that combines classic gameplay systems with modern-day graphics. The next Atelier game from Koei Tecmo follows protagonists Rias Eidreise and Slade Clauslyter on a journey to solve the mystery behind entire villages being seemingly abandoned, and the game features several new systems to keep combat and exploration exciting. In case you missed it, this is the second Atelier release this year, as Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories & the Envisioned Land launched back in March.See at AmazonEA Sports FC 26Release date: September 25Platforms: PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, SwitchAnother big sports game arriving this month, EA Sports FC 26 sees EA evolve the beautiful game of soccer with several new gameplay mechanics and features. Competitive and Authentic gameplay presets will determine the difficulty level at which you'll be playing in various modes--Competitive for online and Authentic for offline play--gameplay mechanics have once again been tweaked based on player feedback, and goalkeepers have been updated to act more realistically than ever before. All of these changes are accompanied by a plethora of real-life players, teams, and leagues alongside career management Ultimate Team modes.EA Sports FC 26 Standard Edition$70 | Releases September 26See at AmazonSee at Best BuySee at GameStopEA Sports FC 26 Ultimate Edition$100 | Releases September 19See at PlayStation StoreSee at Xbox StoreSee at Switch eShopFinal Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice ChroniclesRelease date: September 25Platforms: PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, SwitchA classic from the PlayStation era, turn-based strategy game Final Fantasy Tactics gets a new lease on life with The Ivalice Chronicles. While the original was overshadowed by Final Fantasy 7 when it first released, Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles launches during an otherwise quiet time for the franchise in 2025. A complete overhaul of the beloved spin-off, the game has been thoroughly modernized with new voice-overs, cleaned-up graphics, and various quality-of-life adjustments.Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles$50 | Amazon Exclusive EditionPreorder at AmazonHades 2Release date: September 25Platforms: PC, Switch 2, SwitchHades 2 has been in early access on PC since last year, but on console?

Revealed during Nintendo Direct September 2025, Supergiant's Hades 2 will be a timed exclusive on Switch 2 and Switch consoles, and on the newer Nintendo hardware, it'll run at a blistering 120 frames per second in docked mode. There's no word yet on when it'll come to PS5 and Xbox Series X|S yet.Alien Rogue Incursion: Evolved EditionRelease date: September 30Platforms: PC, PS5Alien: Rogue Incursion was not a good game when it launched for VR devices last year, but could the upcoming PC and PS5 release improve on this imperfect organism? That's the pressing question, as this new version of the game will include more xenomorphs and enhanced visuals when it escapes VR confinement. Rogue Incursion takes place in yet another human offworld colony that has been overrun by the free-facehugs monsters.See on SteamNicktoons and the Dice of DestinyRelease date: September 30Platforms: PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, SwitchWe've seen kart-racing and fighting games featuring an all-star roster of characters from the Nickelodeon Universe, but this month, you can embark on an action-RPG across mystical lands with the likes of SpongeBob Squarepants, the Fairly OddParents, and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Designed to be a kid-friendly adventure, Nicktoons and the Dice of Destiny is a top-down action-RPG that plays similarly to games like Path of Exile 2 or Diablo 4, but is much more forgiving.Nicktoons & The Dice of Destiny Standard Edition$50 | Releases September 30Preorder at AmazonPreorder at WalmartPreorder at Best BuyNicktoons & The Dice of Destiny Collector's Edition$80 | Releases September 30Preorder at TargetPreorder at GameStop
