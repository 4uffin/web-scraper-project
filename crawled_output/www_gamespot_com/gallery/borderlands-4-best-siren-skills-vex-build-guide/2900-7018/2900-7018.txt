Turns all melee damage and gun damage into that elemental type.Elemental affinities: Kinetic and all elements.Skill trees and action skills:
Here Comes Trouble: Phase Phamiliar - Summons a large cat companion named Trouble.The Fourth Seal: Dead Ringer - Summons a Reaper clone that can taunt and attack with a scythe, or a Specter clone that shoots guns.Vexcalation: Incarnate - Changes into an eldritch being that fires projectiles.Siren skill tree: Here Comes Trouble / Phase PhamiliarFor our Borderlands 4 best Siren skills and Vex build, we've opted for Here Comes Trouble--i.e. being able to summon a large cat companion.Action skill: Phase PhamiliarTrouble joins you as a companion. When killed, Trouble will respawn after a short cooldown.Press "F" to teleport Trouble to deal damage in an area. Trouble transforms into a Badass, fully restoring his health and gaining increased damage for a duration.Activating Phase Phamiliar respawns Trouble if he's currently dead.Augment option 1: Vorpal FangTrouble gains a chance to cirtically hit with all attacks.Press and hold "F" to command Trouble to spawn Phase Daggers that fire at nearby enemies.Augment option 2: Beast ModePress and hold "F" to command Trouble to enter Beast Mode. He gains immunity to damage, increased attack speed, and movement speed for a duration.Kill Skill: Extends the duration of Beast Mode.Capstone: Double TroubleTrouble gains a chance to create an illusion. Critical hits double the chance of this occurring.Illusions become Badasses when Phase Phamiliar is active.Notable Here Comes Trouble perks:Vorpal Fiends - Vex and her minions gain increased critical hit damage.Elemental Essence - Vex gains increased elemental damage; doubled effect when your action skill is active.Infernal Sum - Vex and her minions gain increased critical hit damage against enemies who have less than 66.6% health.Additional perks to get:Here Comes Trouble: Keen Fiends - Minion damage has a chance to critically hit on any body part of an enemy.Here Comes Trouble: Tail Whip - Trouble can do whip his tail to deal damage in an area.Here Comes Trouble: Shocking Attunement - While Vex is attuned to Shock, gain increased movement speed and gun damage while moving/walking.The Fourth Seal: Cold Iron - Vex and her minions gain increased gun damage.The Fourth Seal: Portents of Suffering - Vex and her minions gain increased status effect damage.The Fourth Seal: Grave Assault - Vex and her minions gain increased fire rate for a duration after killing an enemy.Vexcalation: Grave Sights - Vex gains increased critical hit damage and gun handling.What makes the Trouble skill tree the best choice?We feel that Here Comes Trouble and related perks are the best Vex skills in Borderlands 4. It's not just because cats are awesome--we all know this for a fact. Rather, it's because Trouble has a ton of health, allowing him to tank lots of damage. He also stays on the battlefield longer, a far cry from the Dead Ringer specters that gradually lose health and dissipate over time.Perhaps the most important aspect is that Trouble already distracts enemies effectively--i.e. you don't necessarily need the Hexus Nexus Augment which commands him to taunt foes. He basically "pulls so much aggro" that there's a good chance some enemies and even bosses will just focus on him. Vex is free to deal as much damage from farther away and, if you're focusing on building up your critical stat, you can rip apart your foes with ease.That does it for our guide on the best Vex Siren skills in Borderlands 4. To complement Vex's abilities and build, we encourage you to check our best Firmware mods guide. The set bonuses from Deadeye and, to an extent, High Caliber, are great for ranged damage.From exploring vast frontiers to watching legendary loot rain down on you, there's a lot to keep you engaged as you continue your adventures as a Vault Hunter.
