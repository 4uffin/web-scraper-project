The best games with multiple endings give all the power to the player, allowing them to guide the story and influence events as they progress. Sure, we all love a linear game with a defined narrative but sometimes you want your choices to matter, especially if you can play the whole game again and get a totally different result. This list is for when one ending is not enough--for those who demand more!Some of these games were designed to have a small selection of specific paths to choose from, while some allow great variation in play style, rewarding the player with countless endings and endless replayability. There's plenty of crossover with the best RPG games, but also some unexpected entries from a wide range of genres. We've picked our favourite games with more than one ending, but in explaining why they hit so hard you may come across some spoilers, so be prepared!Share this GalleryLatest Image GalleriesHades 2 - All Keepsakes And How To Unlock ThemHades 2 - How To Unlock Animal Familiars And PetsHades 2 Arcana Guide And The Best Arcana Cards To UseUndertaleWhen many of us first played Undertale we didn't realise there was a different way to play. Inspired heavily by Earthbound, the format felt familiar--you'd get ambushed by a monster and start attacking it until it was dead. Little did we realise there was another path, we didn't have to kill anyone, and could in fact reunite every monster at the end. Over time this became better known. There was a "neutral" ending for those who had slipped and killed one or two monsters, a "pacifist" (or "true") ending for those who kept things light throughout, but there was also the "genocide" ending--for players who wiped out every single monster in the Underground.The third path was packed with harder boss fights and eerie commentary, ending in a jumpscare from a previously unseen character. It felt like the stuff of a creepypasta legend when we first experienced it, with online rumours and videos being shared to prove this nasty ending was possible. Just be aware if you want to try it, you'll have to go to great lengths to wipe all existing data off your PC or console first.Toby Fox's next game Deltarune also has (at least) two routes, even though he's said there may not be multiple endings. Either way, we won't have to wait too much longer for Deltarune's next chapter.See at Best BuyFeatured in this ImageUndertale%gameName%Get the latest news and videos for this game daily, no spam, no fuss.

You're Good to Go!We'll begin emailing you updates about %gameName%.FollowDisco ElysiumDisco Elysium has three main endings and twelve "game over" screens for various drunken cop exploits. These game overs include things like suffering a heart attack, falling asleep in the trash, electrocuting yourself, and even shooting a kid on duty. These are failure states, however, and don't count as full endings.Of the real endings of Disco Elysium, these become apparent after the Mercenary Tribunal shoot-out. From here, the game splits into three paths. We won't go too spoiler-y, but each ending is worth exploring at least once, just to see the highs and lows of Harry's experience. Depending on the decisions you made leading up to the end of the game, there's a few "good but not perfect" endings, a "true" ending… and some pretty awful outcomes.See at FanaticalFanatical and GameSpot are both owned by Fandom.Featured in this ImageDisco Elysium%gameName%Get the latest news and videos for this game daily, no spam, no fuss.

You're Good to Go!We'll begin emailing you updates about %gameName%.FollowThe Dark Pictures Anthology SeriesThe games in the Dark Pictures Anthology include The Devil In Me, Little Hope, and Man of Medan among others, all looking to explore the world of horror a little more since Until Dawn took the genre by storm. The games throw you headfirst into various genres of horror from slow-burn survival to slasher flick, asking you to make split-second decisions to try to survive the horrors and save as many people as you can.Often, saving other characters isn't purely about physical strength or cunning, but also helping them deal with their own demons or finding them closure. This can be tough among the monsters, killers, and weapons being hurled at you, but through a series of QTEs it can be done. The goal of the player is often to try to save everyone, although this is usually the hardest outcome to achieve. More often than not, you'll have to say goodbye to a few other characters as you battle to survive, but can always go back and try again if you don't get the ending you want.See at FanaticalFeatured in this ImageThe Dark Pictures Anthology: The Devil in Me%gameName%Get the latest news and videos for this game daily, no spam, no fuss.

You're Good to Go!We'll begin emailing you updates about %gameName%.FollowDetroit: Become HumanNot only does Detroit: Become Human have multiple endings, it shows you the full branching path as you go. Decisions, triumphs, and fumbles will block off certain options and open up new ones, meaning you'd be hard pushed to have the same playthrough twice in a row.Most of the decisions you make in the game are quick-fire, reacting emotionally to the events playing out before you. From themes of domestic violence to slavery and capitalism, much of what you choose goes on to impact the larger world in the game until your stories start to intertwine. Eventually, you'll get to one of 85 endings.In terms of letting players decide their own path, the game set a new standard, inspiring countless other games to try and reach these heights of player autonomy. If you're looking for more games like Detroit: Become Human, check out our list of games with branching narratives and choices that really matter.See at FanaticalFeatured in this ImageDetroit: Become Human%gameName%Get the latest news and videos for this game daily, no spam, no fuss.

You're Good to Go!We'll begin emailing you updates about %gameName%.FollowBaldur's Gate 3There are so many pathways and endings in Baldur's Gate 3 that Larian Studios even released some of the rarest choices and stats picked by players to shed some light on general trends, including the fact that only 3.87% of players beat Gortash in Wyrm's Rock without activating any traps.One of the most notable things about Baldur's Gate 3 is that choices don't get lost in its wide scope. Choices you make right at the start or when you're just finding your feet, can come back to haunt you all the way in the final battle. Details like this are what makes it one of the best RPGs of all time.There are 3 main endings with a few major variations, but the opportunity for tiny changes means there are around 17,000 different ways your run of Baldur's Gate 3 could end. Check out our Baldur's Gate 3 Endings Guide if you want to give one of the main endings a shot, or wrap up some of the companion storylines ahead of time.See at SteamNine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine DoorsThere are a total of six endings in Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors. The puzzle-packed visual novel presents multiple dilemmas as you're forced to take part in a deadly game, making your way through a series of rooms at the behest of an unseen villain who has implanted you and your companions with an internal bomb.Some of the endings are purely "game over" screens, like the Submarine Ending which kills everyone off pretty much instantly. Depending on which door you go through, you'll find other endings, some being necessary components of the "real" ending which will eventually be available as you continue on. Although a fail state ending might feel like a bad thing, Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors hides nuggets of lore in every ending, meaning you'll get the fullest experience from trying to find them all.See at SteamFeatured in this ImageNine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors%gameName%Get the latest news and videos for this game daily, no spam, no fuss.

You're Good to Go!We'll begin emailing you updates about %gameName%.FollowOmoriAnything we write about Omori will probably be considered a massive spoiler. Despite its cute, colourful, wholesome appearance, Omori presents a startlingly traumatic story and dishes out waves of true psychological horror. Between turn-based RPG combat and puzzle solving, the player is invited to unpack a great deal of trauma and make choices that determine not just your fate, but that of other characters as well.After a while, the game branches into two routes, and from here there are multiple endings available. You either answer the knock at the door, or you ignore it. Such a simple action leads the main character, Sunny, down such different paths, blending with other decisions to absolve--or condemn--him and his friends.See at SteamFeatured in this ImageOmori%gameName%Get the latest news and videos for this game daily, no spam, no fuss.

You're Good to Go!We'll begin emailing you updates about %gameName%.FollowChrono TriggerChrono Trigger celebrated its 30th anniversary in 2025, but remains a powerful, relevant classic--a must play for anyone interested in RPGs. It was also the first game to introduce the concept of a New Game Plus in the way we think of it today, and embraced multiple endings as a part of this near-endless replayability.Chrono Trigger's story is simpler than you remember (which is what makes it so great) but still manages to pack in a total of 12 main "good" endings (13 if you count the DS, mobile, and PC exclusive ending) one "bad" ending, and a smattering of additional minor endings. All of these endings spring from one central point: where, when, and how you fight Lavos, the final boss. For things to go really sour and the apocalypse to arrive, all you have to do is lose.See at SteamFeatured in this ImageChrono Trigger%gameName%Get the latest news and videos for this game daily, no spam, no fuss.

You're Good to Go!We'll begin emailing you updates about %gameName%.FollowThe Forgotten CityA deeply satisfying puzzle game that grew out of a humble Skyrim mod, The Forgotten City has four different endings, each dependent on the player's moral choices. You can read our review of The Forgotten City here, but the gist of it is that you're transported back in time to an ancient Roman city to try and save the inhabitants from a terrifying curse. If anyone in the city commits a sin, everyone gets turned to gold.You'd think everyone would just behave, but as you explore you discover that morals and values differ greatly in this archaic society, and what's right for one person might not always be right for everyone else. You'll have to draw conclusions for yourself and make all the tough decisions, leading to one of the four possible endings, only one of which is the "true" good resolution to this city's woes.See at FanaticalFeatured in this ImageThe Forgotten City%gameName%Get the latest news and videos for this game daily, no spam, no fuss.

You're Good to Go!We'll begin emailing you updates about %gameName%.FollowThe Witcher 3: Wild HuntThere is no shortage of endings in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. 36 of them, to be exact. Granted, some of them deviate very slightly from each other, but the point remains that your every action in the game has some impact on how the world looks when you set down your controller for the final time. What will happen to you, to your companions, to your lovers, friends, and foes--it's all up to you.The Witcher 3 is another one to make an appearance on many best RPG lists, but is also one of the top 10 best-selling video games of all time. If you want to experience a deeply immersive tale that allows you to hold the fate of a kingdom in your hands, you can't go wrong with The Witcher 3. You can even spice it up with this great selection of Witcher 3 mods.See at SteamFeatured in this ImageThe Witcher 3: Wild Hunt%gameName%Get the latest news and videos for this game daily, no spam, no fuss.

You're Good to Go!We'll begin emailing you updates about %gameName%.FollowFallout: New VegasWhile it's true we could have chosen any Fallout title for this list, Fallout: New Vegas is a personal favourite and exemplifies the potential for branching endings that the series is so known for. Your actions throughout the game, right up until the finale, will dictate the round-up slide show at the close of play. Much like in earlier Fallout games, the slides take you through key settlements, characters, and factions, describing where they ended up with your intervention (or negligence) taken into account.There are apparently millions of potential combinations, depending on who you side with and who you bothered to assist, but the main story quest has four possible "key" endings. These are split into factions--did you side with Mr House, Caesar's Legion, the NCR, or did you claim New Vegas for yourself?If you've already played to each of the various endings but still want more, the Fallout Season 2 trailer suggests it'll be the New Vegas remaster everyone's been asking for, with Robert House being a key character when the show returns in December.See at FanaticalFeatured in this ImageFallout: New Vegas%gameName%Get the latest news and videos for this game daily, no spam, no fuss.

You're Good to Go!We'll begin emailing you updates about %gameName%.FollowReventureReventure is a little different from the other entries on this list, because the whole point of the game is to find different endings. It's not a byproduct of an immersive system, but rather the game's main premise. Every decision you make on this query hero's quest takes you down another path, and you'll eventually come out at one of Reventure's 100 different endings. All you have to do is work out which is the real one--or if there's even a "real" one at all.100 endings are nice and all, but what really elevates Reventure is how packed with secrets, references, and surprises it is. Once you've unlocked some endings, you can view them in the gallery and attempt to take on all 100, unravelling more of the story as you go.See at SteamFeatured in this ImageReventure%gameName%Get the latest news and videos for this game daily, no spam, no fuss.

You're Good to Go!We'll begin emailing you updates about %gameName%.FollowThe Hundred Line: Last Defense AcademyAlthough your first playthrough of The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy may throw you off the scent, the game actually has 100 full endings available if you follow through. Back when the game was being made, the goal was to create one "true" route, and 99 potential alternative paths, but they all had to read as fully-fleshed out endings. No throwaway end-game screens or glib "bad choice" scenarios, each ending had to carry its own significant meaning. They wanted all routes to be dense enough to be considered potentially canon, alongside the one they themselves considered to be the real ending.What's more, the multiple angles take the player through multiple different genres depending on their choices, opening up whole new avenues of narrative in what is already a sizable story.See at Best BuyFeatured in this ImageThe Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy%gameName%Get the latest news and videos for this game daily, no spam, no fuss.
