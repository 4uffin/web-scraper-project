Available on PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and Switch.See at FanaticalClair Obscur: Expedition 33Claire Obscur: Expedition 33 feels like a breath of fresh air in the fantasy RPG genre. While there are familiar elements here, developer Sandfall Interactive also puts a novel spin on these ideas by re-imagining the traditional turn-based structure and blending it with action to create an engaging experience.

A game that'll appeal to people who care deeply for animals and nature, Herdling is a beautiful trek across scenic vistas and it tells a grand story without ever needing to speak a single word.

This coming-of-age story feels authentic and explores adolescence through a superb presentation, relatable characters, and novel camcorder-focused gameplay.Read our Lost Records: Bloom and Rage review. Available on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.See at AmazonMario Kart World -- 9A colorful racing game that builds on the foundation of Mario Kart 8, Mario Kart World is both a joy to play and constantly rewarding. It's the first big exclusive of the Switch 2 era, and one of the best games in the long history of this beloved franchise.Read our Mario Kart World review. Available on Switch 2.WalmartTargetBest BuyMetal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater -- 9Remaking a beloved classic is no easy feat, and the task becomes even more daunting when that game is considered to be the very best entry in the legendary Metal Gear Solid series. To its credit, Konami has successfully modernized Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, bringing it to life with vivid graphics, an overhauled control scheme on par with contemporary games, and a wealth of extra content. These upgrades and tweaks enhance Snake's dangerous mission for a new generation while still feeling familiar to veterans of the series, and its unchanged Cold War-era story remains as timeless as ever.Read our Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater review. Available on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.See at AmazonShinobi: Art of Vengeance -- 9After years of hiding in the shadows, Sega's Shinobi series has made a big comeback with a game that both honors its legacy and evolves it for a new audience. With Streets of Rage 4 developer Lizardcube at the helm, Shinobi: Art of Vengeance is a fast-paced action game full of delicious combos to dial in and shurikens to hurl at unsuspecting foes. Old-school at its core, this new Shinobi adventure does the franchise proud with its slick gameplay and reverence for the past. It's good to see Joe Musashi back in action.Read our Shinobi: Art of Vengeance review. Available on PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and Switch.See on FanaticalThe Alters -- 8An engrossing combination of base-building, survival, and self-reflection, The Alters is a captivating experience. Managing a workforce comprised of your alternate selves while you race to avoid being fried by a looming sunrise on a barren alien planet is consistently engaging, but it's moral dilemmas and interactions with your human resources that'll stick with you after you roll credits on this sci-fi gem.Read our The Alters review. Available on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.See at AmazonAssassin's Creed Shadows -- 8A beautiful tour of feudal Japan, Assassin's Creed Shadows is an exciting adventure full of moments that'll keep you on the edge of your seat. Admittedly, that's if you decide to focus on Naoe for your playthrough, as co-protagonist Yasuke feels out of place in this action-RPG when compared to his shinobi counterpart. Naoe's gameplay elevates the traditional stealth experience, and while there are narrative shortcomings, Assassin's Creed Shadows is still a worthwhile entry in the series.Read our Assassin's Creed Shadows review. Available on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.See at AmazonCapcom Fighting Collection 2 -- 8Capcom continues to raise the bar for game preservation with its compilations, and while some entries in Capcom Fighting Collection 2 haven't aged too well, this is still a rock-solid package to check out. Titles like Capcom Fighting Evolution and Power Stone are weak in comparison to gems like Plasma Sword and Street Fighter Alpha 3 Upper, but this is still a treasure trove of classic games to check out.Read our Capcom Fighting Collection 2 review. Available on PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch.See at AmazonCronos: The New Dawn -- 8Bloober Team delivered an impressive remake of Silent Hill 2 last year, but with Cronos: The New Dawn, the studio proves that it's just as adept at crafting original tales of suspense. Best described as Dead Space meets a cult-classic '80s time-travel dystopian movie, Cronos will keep you on your toes with its sci-fi horror and enemies that'll test your fight-or-flight responses. It has a dangerous world that you'll want to explore in its entirety, as well as one of this year's best video game soundtracks with its catchy synth beats.Read our Cronos: The New Dawn review. Available on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.Cronos: The New Dawn Standard Edition$60 | Releases September 5Preorder at AmazonPreorder at WalmartPreorder at Best BuyCronos: The New Dawn Deluxe Edition$70 | Releases September 3Preorder at PlayStation StorePreorder at Xbox StorePreorder at SteamDead Take -- 8Surreal and intellectually stimulating, Dead Take is a fascinating dive into the mind of an actor. It's anchored by a cast of incredible performers and meaty gameplay with rewarding puzzle mechanics, making for a short harrowing experience that's hard to put down once it sinks its hooks into you.Read our Dead Take review. Available on PC.See on SteamDoom: The Dark Ages -- 8With its medieval-inspired direction, Doom: The Dark Ages is thrilling to play thanks to its harmonious fusion of solid gunplay and heavy metal close-quarters combat. The appeal of ripping and tearing through armies of demons feels better than ever, as the game finds a satisfying balance between fast-paced action and satisfyingly brutal new gameplay mechanics.Read our Doom: The Dark Ages review. Available on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.See on AmazonDying Light: The Beast -- 8Dying Light: The Beast puts a fresh spin on the established gameplay mechanics of the original games. While the core concept of adventuring during the day and keeping a low profile at night create two distinct ways to play the game, it's the brutally satisfying combat, nerve-wracking survival-horror, and cheesy B-movie vibes that make it an exciting addition to the Dying Light franchise.Read our Dying Light: The Beast review. Available for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.See on SteamEA Sports College Football 26 -- 8After more than a decade away, EA's collegiate football series made a triumphant return last year, and this year's entry in the franchise builds on that momentum. While EA Sports College Football 26 is an iterative sequel, there's still plenty here to enjoy from renewed emphasis on rivalries between colleges to exciting modes that offer a thrilling alternative to other football games on the market.Read our EA Sports College Football 26 review. Available for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.See at AmazonThe Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered -- 8It might have been one of the worst-kept secrets in gaming, but the grand remaster of The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion still manages to surprise thanks to the sheer depth of the work done to freshen it up for a new generation of gamers. While some of the gameplay is admittedly still rough, the charm here lies in the incredible visual overhaul alongside numerous quality-of-life changes done by developer Virtuos and Bethesda.Available on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. Read our The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered review.See at FanaticalFatal Fury: City of the Wolves -- 8Fatal Fury: City Of The Wolves is a colorful fighting game that offers a polished fighting system inspired by its past and some forward-thinking with the balanced REV System. Energetic and loaded with a roster that encourages experimentation, Fatal Fury: City Of The Wolves is only slightly hamstrung by its sparse selection of gameplay modes.Available on PC, PS5, PS4, and Xbox Series X|S. Read our Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves review.See on AmazonFBC: Firebreak -- 8Remedy Entertainment is known for its single-player games, but FBC: Firebreak sees the studio venture into live-service territory in this Control spin-off. While its opening hours are admittedly a bit of a slog to get through, FBC: Firebreak does start to open up once all the pieces fall into place. Making class-based builds feels rewarding, the gunplay is rock-solid, and the intentional push to reject the trappings of live-service FOMO makes for a fun time with friends.Read our FBC: Firebreak review. Available on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.The First Berserker: Khazan -- 8The First Berserker: Khazan wears its souls-like inspiration on its sleeve, but at the same time, it puts its own spin on the genre with a few clever ideas. A killer combo of parry-heavy combat straight from Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, visuals that pack a punch, and hard-hitting action will keep you on the edge of your seat in this thrilling adventure.Read our The First Berserker: Khazan review. Available on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.See at AmazonLies of P: Overture -- 8Featuring a compelling story at its core, Overture is more of the same in the best way possible. You've got an expanded arsenal to experiment with, more enemies to test your skills, and imaginatively designed locations to explore in this meaty expansion.Read our Lies of P: Overture review. Available on PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One.See on FanaticalLuto -- 8It's downright criminal that we never got to see Hideo Kojima's take on Silent Hill--PT--but the next best thing might just be Luto. An unpredictable ghost story, Luto is undeniably inspired by PT but it rises above that comparison by being a well-crafted experience that can shock and amaze you in equal measure.Read our Luto review. Available for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.See on SteamMadden NFL 26 -- 8With annual franchises like Madden, there's no getting around the fact that each game provides iterative upgrades at best. In Madden NFL 26, those new gameplay features are being added to an already solid foundation of sporting action, and they're surprisingly bigger than you'd imagine them to be. Pairing the series' great on-field gameplay with a complete overhaul of Franchise mode has resulted in the best NFL sports-RPG fantasy in years.Read our Madden NFL 26 review. Available on PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch 2.See at AmazonMLB The Show 25 -- 8Like other sports games, MLB The Show 25 is another fine example of incremental improvements leading to impactful changes. Tweaks have helped to further polish its captivating gameplay, resulting in a game that feels more dynamic than ever with every swing of the bat.

Available on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch.See at AmazonMonster Hunter Wilds -- 8Monster Hunter World and Monster Hunter Rise did a great job in building a rock-solid foundation for the series, and with Monster Hunter Wilds, Capcom's series feels more welcoming than ever to newcomers.

Available on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.See at AmazonNBA 2K26 -- 8The NBA 2K series is in a league of its own when it comes to basketball, and once again, it raises the bar for just how authentic a sports-simulator video game can be. While the deeply embedded pay-to-win shenanigans can sour the experience, at its core, NBA 2K26 is still a dynamic game full of welcome tweaks to its gameplay and graphics that take another step forward toward photo-realism.Read our NBA 2K26 review. Available for PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox, Switch 2, and Switch.Ninja Gaiden: Rebound -- 82025 is turning out to be the year of Ninja Gaiden, as this gem of a retro-inspired game is comfortably sandwiched between a well-crafted remaster and an upcoming sequel from the series. Blasphemous developer The Game Kitchen recaptures the magic of the classic Ninja Gaiden games, using them as inspiration to create a relentlessly challenging action-platformer that feels like it was ripped straight out of the SNES era.Read our Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound review. Available for PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and Switch.See at AmazonOld Skies -- 8A touching tale of love and loss wrapped up in an engrossing mystery, Old Skies is an enchanting point-and-click adventure game in which you play as professional time traveler Fia Quinn.

Available on PC and Switch.See on SteamRevenge of the Savage Planet -- 8While its combat could feel more impactful, Revenge of the Savage Planet is still a fun game and a sharp satire of corporate greed. It never takes itself too seriously, and whether you're on your lonesome or teaming up with a friend in co-op, exploring its diverse planets makes for an engaging mix of platforming and puzzle-solving.Read our Revenge of the Savage Planet review. Available on PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One. See at AmazonSid Meier's Civilization VII -- 8Civilization VII doesn't reinvent its 4X turn-based wheel, but it does make some significant changes to its design. How these changes will shape up in the grand scheme of things remains to be seen--as some of them could very contentious with longtime players--but at its core, the Firaxis-developed strategy game is still as compelling as ever. Whether you're shaping civilization through diplomacy or warfare, Civilization VII has a strong foundation to build upon in the years to come.Read our Civilization VII review. Available on PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and Switch.See at AmazonThe Sims 4: Enchanted By Nature -- 9At this point in the life-cycle of The Sims 4, there's a mountain of DLC out there for the life-simulator. Enchanted By Nature solidifies its position as one of the best paid DLC releases for the game, as it goes all in on the idea of living your best fantasy life with its vibrant locales and enchanting fairy gameplay.Read our The Sims 4: Enchanted By Nature review. Available for PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One.Skin Deep -- 8Skin Deep is a fine example of taking a genre known for being traditionally dark and injecting some absurdity into it. The oddball immersive sim is delightfully silly, but it's also a puzzle box that requires you to think on your feet, come up with clever solutions, and experiment with every tool in the environment to triumph against overwhelming odds.Available on PC. Read our Skin Deep review.See at Green Man GamingSouth of Midnight -- 8South of Midnight plays it safe with its gameplay, but it more than makes up for it with a fantastic story, a setting that feels authentic, and imaginative visuals. An exploration of the American Deep South, South of Midnight is mechanically sound in its construction and stunning in its storytelling.Read our South of Midnight review. Available on PC and Xbox Series X|S.See on SteamTony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4 Review -- 8Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 and 4 perfected the gameplay of the series, and decades later, they're getting a chance to shine once again in a package that enhances them for a new generation.

Available for PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and Switch 2.See at AmazonTrails in the Sky 1st Chapter -- 8With multiple games in the Trails series, it can be daunting to find an entry-point into this franchise. Fortunately, Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter solves this problem by remaking the debut game in Falcom's epic industrial-fantasy saga. With the original story intact--but thankfully with the fat trimmed off--a well-balanced gameplay system, and a cast of lovable characters at its core, this is a faithful remake that'll appeal to series veterans and newcomers alike.Read our Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter review. Available for PC, PS5, Switch 2, and Switch.Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter$60 | Releases September 19Preorder at AmazonPreorder at WalmartPreorder at Best BuyPreorder at TargetSunderfolk -- 8Like the best board game experiences, Sunderfolk is a blast when you have a few friends along for the ride.

Available on PC, PS5, and PS4. See at FanaticalDisclosure: GameSpot and Fanatical are both owned by Fandom.Wuchang: Fallen Feathers -- 8It's very easy to see the souls-like DNA in Wuchang: Fallen Feathers, and while it can play like a derivative compilation of From Software's greatest hits, it also hits that mark with exceptionally well-crafted gameplay that'll appeal to fans of the genre. There are admittedly some balancing and performing issues to work out, but if you're looking for a souls-like with meaty combat, beautifully designed levels, and a gorgeous art direction, this is highly recommended.Read our Wuchang: Fallen Feathers review. Available for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.See at AmazonWWE 2K25 -- 8This year's entry in the sports entertainment video game franchise sticks to that script, delivering an engaging Showcase Mode, a gigantic roster of superstars, and gameplay tweaks that make WWE 2K25 feel like a main-event superstar. The game also introduces The Island, a PvPvE social space heavily inspired by NBA 2K's The City, but you'll want to avoid it in case you aren't a fan of egregious microtransactions.Read our WWE 2K25 review. Available on PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One.See at AmazonEvery other GameSpot review in 2025As mentioned above, not every game released this year is a winner.
