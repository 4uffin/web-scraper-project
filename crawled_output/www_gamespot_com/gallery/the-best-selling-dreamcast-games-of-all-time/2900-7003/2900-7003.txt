Sega's last home console system was released in America 26 years ago. The Dreamcast was the first console to include a built-in modular modem for internet access and online play, beating Sony's PlayStation 2 to the punch by a whole year. Despite its shortened lifespan, some of the Dreamcast's games, such as Shenmue, Jet Set Radio, and Crazy Taxi, are still revered for their innovation.On the list, you'll find some Sega staples like Sonic Adventure and its sequel, as well as a slew of sports titles from the NBA, NFL, NHL, and MLB.The system sold over 9 million units worldwide and produced over 600 games. Now, on its birthday, let's take a look at the best-selling titles for the Dreamcast in both units sold and dollars in the United States, according to Circana--a retail tracking service. The list is split with the first 20 that were measured in units sold, followed by the top 20 that were top sellers in actual dollar amounts. There is a lot of crossover, with only one game difference between the two lists.Share this GalleryLatest Image GalleriesHow To Unlock All Endings In Hollow Knight: SilksongWhere To Find All Pale Oil Weapon Upgrades In Hollow Knight: SilksongThe Biggest Game Releases Of September 20251.
