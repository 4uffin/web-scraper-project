Are you excited to unlock all endings in Hollow Knight: Silksong? Hornet's journey across the lands of Pharloom is fraught with many dangers and harrowing experiences. That said, your adventures will come to a conclusion... somewhat. That's because there are certain segments that lead to even bigger discoveries. Our Hollow Knight: Silksong endings guide has all the details for you, but do expect that this article has major spoilers.How to unlock all endings in Hollow Knight: SilksongSeveral of the game's endings require you to defeat a boss named Grandmother Silk, who awaits at the top of the Citadel. These conclude Act 2 of the campaign. However, a certain quest also unlocks Act 3, which also leads to more ending cinematics.Share this GalleryLatest Image GalleriesJump Space Tips - 8 Things You Need To Know Before You PlayAll Call Of Duty: Black Ops 7 Guns, Weapons, And Perks Available At LaunchAll Call Of Duty: Black Ops 7 Maps Available At LaunchNormal ending: Weaver QueenThis is the default Hollow Knight: Silksong ending. The goal is to complete main quests, culminating in Pharloom's Crown - Threefold Melody. This grants you access to the very top of the Citadel where you do battle against Grandmother Silk. Defeat her, then choose the bind option to finish the game.Note: The next time you load your save, you'll be back at the last bench that you used. This is a save state where the boss is still alive, which means you can unlock other endings.Cursed ending: Twisted ChildAs the term implies, the cursed ending in Hollow Knight: Silksong does have a unique twist. We discuss all the steps further in our Twisted Bud/Rite of Rebirth guide, but here's a quick summary:You need to acquire the Twisted Bud item in Bilewater.Then, bring this to Greyroot in Shellwood--i.e. the NPC from the Pollip Hearts quest.Get afflicted with a curse that prevents you from using your healing bind and other silk spells.Defeat Grandmother Silk while you're cursed.Obviously, this ramps up the challenge since you need to beat the final boss without being able to heal (outside of the benches that you use before the battle). Upon landing the final blow, something different happens and you get to watch a new cinematic.Note: You can cure the affliction, but we only recommend doing this after obtaining the cursed ending. Once Hornet is freed from the curse, there's no way to be afflicted again unless you start another playthrough.Silk and Soul ending: Snared SilkThis secret ending actually unlocks Act 3 in Hollow Knight: Silksong, but it requires a bit of work. You can learn about all the specifics in our Silk and Soul guide. Here's the gist:You must complete all bounty board quests in every settlement. The side quests from NPCs aren't required.You must rescue a lot of Lost Fleas so that the Flea Caravan moves to the Putrefied Ducts.Do the Silk and Soul quest, where you need to obtain four items in different locations.Defeat Grandmother Silk and choose the Needolin option.You'll be back at the main menu after the credits roll. Load your save file to begin Act 3.True ending: Sister of the VoidAssuming you've already started Act 3, then you'll receive this ending if you follow the main quest normally. That means acquiring various abilities and defeating several bosses as part of The Old Hearts mission. Eventually, you'll head deeper into the Abyss for one last confrontation against a certain foe.Mushroom ending: Passing of the AgeMister Mushroom, an NPC from the previous game, makes his return in Silksong. And, yes, there's another obtainable ending that's related to his quest. The goal is to find all seven Mister Mushroom locations throughout Pharloom.Talk to him in each location in the correct order. Then, defeat the final boss in the Abyss--i.e. the Sister of the Void ending. This leads to an extra cutscene where Mister Mushroom makes an appearance.Note: We got the Sister of the Void and Passing of the Age endings separately. We cannot confirm if you're able to get both achievements in one go if you complete Passing of the Age prior to your first clear of the final boss encounter.These are all the Hollow Knight: Silksong endings that we've discovered so far. We'll let you know if there are still others that are extremely well-hidden secrets, so stay tuned. For now, though, we encourage you to continue boosting Hornet's capabilities by acquiring Mask Shards, Spool Fragments, and Pale Oil.Play as Hornet and brave the dangers of the Kingdom of Pharloom.
