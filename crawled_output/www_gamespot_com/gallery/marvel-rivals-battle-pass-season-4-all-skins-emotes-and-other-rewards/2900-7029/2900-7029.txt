Marvel Rivals Season 4 has arrived, bringing the hero shooter to PS4 along with adding a new Vanguard hero, Angela, and a brand new battle pass. Angela is another Norse character, joining Thor and Loki, and will serve as a melee-focused dive tank. In addition to Angela, Daredevil will join the roster as part of the Season 4.5 update, which should arrive in the latter half of October.The new battle pass breaks the pattern established with the previous couple of seasons by now having a unifying theme, instead offering a mishmash of different cosmetics. It features one additional Abyssal Flame skin, the cosmetic theme of Season 3, for Luna Snow. The battle pass also includes two iconic comics outfits, Golden Age Captain America and The Trial of Magneto skin for, well, Magneto, naturally. There is also a Moon Knight Mech skin based on What If… Season 3, the Chinese mythology-inspired Immortal Firebird Loki, and Dark Phoenix for, yup, Phoenix.The battle pass also includes a number of cosmetics, like MVP animations, nameplates, sprays, and emotes. There is also a bunch of currency included in the premium pass, with 600 Lattice, 600 Units, and 500 Unstable Molecules.The battle pass costs 990 Lattice, about $10, with a premium version available for about $22, which includes 2,800 Chrono Tokens, about two pages worth of currency, and a 20% boost to the amount of Chrono Tokens you earn during the season. Season 4 marks the continuation of the shorter seasons for Marvel Rivals, now lasting about two months. Below you can see every reward in the Marvel Rivals Season 4 battle pass.Share this GalleryLatest Image GalleriesWhere To Find All Tools In Hollow Knight: SilksongGames Like Diablo To Loot Your Way Through In 2025All The Nintendo Switch 2 Games (Confirmed And Rumored) So Far
