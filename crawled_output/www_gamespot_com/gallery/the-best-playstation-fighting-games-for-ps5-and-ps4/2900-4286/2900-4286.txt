As long as PlayStation has been around, it has been seen as one of the best consoles to have for fighting game fans. A rock-solid line-up of games, legacy franchises, and one of the best controller D-pads for multiple generations has made Sony's gaming hardware the default choice for some of the greatest fighting games of the era, and right now, not much has changed on that front. We've rounded up the best PlayStation fighting games for PS5 and PS4.With the PS4 being a hub for fighting games during their renaissance in the 2010s and the PS5 being backwards compatible with the vast majority of that library, we've slipped into our most comfortable Walmart-sourced karate gi and stepped into the ring to face off with the best that the PlayStation has to offer. Below, you'll find our picks for the best PlayStation fighting games to play on PS5 and PS4. Instead of ranking these fighters, we've listed our choices in alphabetical order.For more lists, you can check out the best RPGs for PS4 and PS5, the best free PS5 games available right now, and the must-play PS5 titles for the system.Share this GalleryLatest Image GalleriesHades 2 - All Keepsakes And How To Unlock ThemHades 2 - How To Unlock Animal Familiars And PetsHades 2 Arcana Guide And The Best Arcana Cards To UseBlazBlue: Cross Tag BattleYou could fill this entire list with games from renowned developer Arc System Works--and trust us, they're here in force--but some of its lesser-known properties are worth looking at. BlazBlue: Cross Tag Battle looks and feels like the perfect template for an Arc game, a flashy anime brawler with ultimate attacks that can melt your retinas if you stare too long. Beyond that initial snazzy impression, Cross Tag is a standout title in the 2D anime fighting game genre thanks to its dynamic tag system, fascinating mechanics, and a versatile selection of characters to choose from.Read our BlazBlue: Cross Tag Battle review.See on AmazonCapcom Fighting CollectionIt's a slight cheat, but we're hellbent on getting Darkstalkers on this list and can do so thanks to the release of the Capcom Fighting Collection.It's full of Darkstalkers titles that prove just how important this series is to the history of fighting games. It's not just Darkstalkers being represented with a loving approach in this collection though, as you can also go hands on with the superb Super Gem Fighter Mini-Mix in a presentation that goes all in on its arcade heritage.Read our Capcom Fighting Collection review.See on AmazonDead or Alive 6The best entry in the long-running Dead or Alive series, DOA 6 perfects its trademark formula by making every single jab, roundhouse kick, and grapple feel like it genuinely matters. Every member of the massive cast has an X-factor that makes them deserving of dedicated Wiki fan clubs, battles erupt with explosive displays of power, and the the rock-paper-scissors strategy feels better than ever in this classic clash of icons.Read our Dead or Alive 6 review.See on AmazonDNF Duel2022 has been a terrific year for fighting games, with titles such as DNF Duel leading the charge. Another knockout from Arc System Works, DNF Duel is set in the world of Dungeon Fighter Online and gives players an experience that's easy to pick up but rewarding to invest time and effort into as they master its systems. It's Arc System Works once again delivering a wonderfully complex fighting game, adapting an established IP into a title that's fun in online or offline play.Read our DNF Duel review.See on AmazonDragon Ball FighterZOne of the best fighting games of the last generation, Dragon Ball FighterZ hits every beat for what a Dragon Ball game should be. It's a mix of style and substance that looks amazing to see in action and feels even better when you go hands-on with it, has a stacked roster of fan-favorite characters, and it's loaded with special moves that can vaporize a planet when properly executed.Read our Dragon Ball FighterZ review.See on AmazonEA Sports UFC 5UFC 5 is a culmination of the entire franchise's history, featuring some of the most iconic fighters in the sport along with fresh faces as well. Several new fighters have also been introduced since the release of the game, so there's always something to look forward to. Gameplay-wise, UFC 5 features similar game modes you've come to expect from the franchise. There's Career, which is the bread-and-butter online mode that acts as a ranked playlist for the game. UFC 5 also offers more authentic combat than its predecessors and features a fulfilling live-service experience that's based on real UFC fights throughout the year.See on EAGarou - Mark of the WolvesFatal Fury doesn't get nearly enough love for its influence on the fighting game genre. If you missed out on the superb series during its heyday, then the school of hard knocks is in session with this updated gem. Originally released in 1999 and then regularly released onto more modern platforms every couple of years, Garou: Mark of the Wolves can still land a stylish knockout blow with its fast-paced action, colorful characters, and rollback netcode that makes it a cult-classic with fans.Read our Fatal Fury: Garou - Mark of the Wolves review.See on PlayStation NetworkGranblue Fantasy: VersusRead our Granblue Fantasy: Versus review.See on AmazonGuilty Gear StriveBefore it was producing the best adaptations of Dragon Ball, Granblue, and Dungeon Fighter Online, Arc System Works was making a name for itself with Guilty Gear. Transitioning from its 2D anime fighter roots to a more modern design in Unreal Engine, Guilty Gear Strive is heavy metal melee action that's perfect for newcomers and fighting game veterans. It's welcoming to rookies, rewarding for experts, and everyone can have a great time when they throw down in this stylish genre gold standard.Read our Guilty Gear Strive review.See on AmazonInjustice 2Could Batman beat Superman in a fight? If you want to end that debate once and for all by taking matters into your own hands, then you should grab Injustice 2 for a super-powered showdown. From Mortal Kombat studio NetherRealm, Injustice 2 is a hard-hitting and good-looking fighting game that stars the greatest heroes and villains of DC Comics and smashes them together into a clash of titans. It has its own distinct feel, one of the best loot systems in the genre, and a story that makes the superhero civil war hit you right in the emotion organs with every cataclysmic haymaker.Read our Injustice 2 review.See on AmazonThe King of Fighters XVSNK's long-running King of Fighters franchise has struggled to find a mainstream audience over the decades, but if one game was to find a dedicated global player base, then it was this splendid redemption story. With KOF 14 receiving a tepid response when it first launched, SNK went back to the drawing board for KOF 15 and turned it into a serious contender. Gameplay was tightened up, the cast was as impressively massive as usual, and it had more personality in every pixel than ever before. It may not be a fighting game paradigm shift, but KOF 15 is still a satisfying return to form for the veteran franchise.Read our The King of Fighters XV review.See on AmazonMortal Kombat 1Arguably the most recognizable fighting game franchise on the planet, Mortal Kombat 1 is the latest game in the series. This particular title marks a new era for the franchise, as it delivers a brand new combat system and game modes. The single-player campaign is especially notable, as it features RPG elements and deep progression for your character. Of course, you can always partake in online multiplayer, which pits you against similarly skilled players in a true test of wits. You'll see brand new fatalities and combat mechanics, such as Kameos, which allow you to call in some help during a battle.See on FanaticalMultiversusHaving just released this year, Multiversus is already making waves with its Smash-like gameplay that gives Nintendo's premier fighting game series a run for its money. It has one of the quirkiest rosters in video game history--Shaggy Rogers, Bugs Bunny, and Batman are just some of the inspired choices here--and its core gameplay makes it a blast to play. Even better, you can try out the game for free, and if it gets its wascally wabbit hooks in you, you can earn new characters with regular play.Read our Multiversus review.See on PlayStation NetworkNidhogg 2While most fighting games have a rich selection of mechanics for you to learn and master over many hours of play, Nidhogg 2 emphasizes simplicity. It's a fast-paced duel of wits and reflexes that improves on the original, offering wonderfully grotesque visuals, an expanded arsenal, and a layer of speed that makes every round a frantic rush to the finish. That core gameplay makes it easy to pick up, and within a few minutes, you'll be shouting "EN GARDE" to your friends as you start swinging steel in this spectacular party game.Read our Nidhogg 2 review.See on PlayStation NetworkSamurai ShodownSamurai Shodown is the type of fighting game where a match can be decided with a minimal number of moves. It looks fantastic, and the focus on weapon-based combat forces a more measured approach to each round. The difference between life or death makes for a tense experience, and once you've got the hang of its unique flow, you'll find that this game is an exhilarating dance of sharp-edged strategy and combat.Read our Samurai Shodown review.See on AmazonSoulcalibur VISticking to the sharper side of fighting games, Soulcalibur VI is a highlight in the eternal tale of swords and souls. The three-dimensional combat still has a sharp edge to it, while the sheer variety of characters available makes each match a game of tactics and clever maneuvering. It's the grand atmosphere of adventure and treasure where Soulcalibur VI feels ahead of its contemporaries, adding that drive for epic stories into a game that has deep and rewarding mechanics at its heart.Read our Soulcalibur VI review.See on AmazonSkullgirls 2nd EncoreA western take on the 2D animated fighter subgenre, Skullgirls 2nd Encore will knock your digital socks off with haymakers and its passionate design. Going for quality over quantity, the small roster of Skullgirls features unique gameplay tricks up their sleeves, distinct personalities, and outstanding animation. Throw in a soundtrack that'll have you tapping a hole in your floor with your foot, and you've got a winning combination.See on AmazonStreet Fighter 6Street Fighter 6 has been one of the most well-received fighting games of the 2020s, and it's still going strong in 2025, two years after its initial release. Replayability is not an issue whatsoever with Street Fighter 6, as you can partake in three separate game modes: World Tour, Fighting Ground, and Battle Hub. Each mode offers a different kind of gameplay, but you'll have access to the game's roster of 18 fighters regardless. You'll see some of your favorite fighters return, as well as new additions to the roster. Street Fighter 6 also introduces different ways to engage with combat, as you can utilize one of three combat styles that each have their own pros and cons. Combat changes even more with the Drive Gauge system, which adds a new layer of resource management to each fight.See on FanaticalTekken 8The Tekken franchise has remained right up there with the best fighting games on the market since the original was released in 1994. Tekken 8 offers over 30 characters to choose from as well as an engaging and lengthy single-player campaign. Of course, the main draw of any Tekken title is the online multiplayer, which allows you to battle against other players in both unranked and ranked playlists. In these battles, you can master your character's moves and combos and take advantage of the new Heat mechanic or use Rage Arts to get yourself out of a tight jam.See on FanaticalUltimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3More than a decade has passed since Capcom decided to cross fists with Marvel, and in the years since Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 released, it remains one of the go-to games for over-the-top action. Still an absolute beast in the graphical department, the Ultimate edition has it all: characters, stages, and extra features that put its spiritual follow-up, 2017's Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite, to shame. Setting a high benchmark for the franchise, you can pick this gem up for a bargain and enjoy plenty of bang for your buck.Read our Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 review.See on PlayStation NetworkVirtua Fighter 5 Ultimate ShowdownThere's no getting around the fact that Virtua Fighter 5 Ultimate Showdown has a barebones single-player setup, but beyond that, it's a showcase of what makes Virtua Fighter special. Remade in Yakuza's Dragon Engine and looking better than ever, it has a lot of depth to its tactical martial arts and keeps getting better as you invest more time into its rich selection of systems.Read our Virtua Fighter 5 Ultimate Showdown review.See on PlayStation NetworkSifuSifu is one of the more unique fighting games you can play. Instead of going for the more visceral and gory graphics that most fighting games are synonymous with, Sifu opts for beautiful, animated visuals and environments. Of course, the graphics don't change the nature of the core gameplay, as you'll still engage in violent combat that requires quick reactions and strategy. The game utilizes a Kung Fu-style of combat, and you'll play through Sifu's entire single-player story to master this art form. There's no online multiplayer in Sifu, but after one playthrough of the story, you'll be more than satisfied with your experience.See on FanaticalUNDER NIGHT IN-BIRTH II Sys:CelesThe Under Night In-Birth franchise is fairly underrated outside of the hardcore fighting game community. It doesn't offer the realistic and visceral graphics of other fighting games, opting for an anime visual style, but the core gameplay should still feel familiar to any fan of the genre. The second installment of the Under Night In-Birth series, Sys:Celes, boasts two dozen characters to choose from and a casual and ranked playlist so players of all skill levels have something to enjoy. While Sys:Celes offers the same in-depth combos and combat mechanics you see in other fighting games, the game also has a simplified combat style for beginners. However, don't expect Sys:Celes to be a carbon copy of similar games, as it features plenty of different mechanics that make it stand out from the crowd.See on Fanatical
