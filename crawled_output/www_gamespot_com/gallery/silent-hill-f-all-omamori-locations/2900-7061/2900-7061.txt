Omamori function like equipment in Silent Hill f, providing different boosts to your character. They can be as simple as boosting one of your primary stats, like Health or Stamina, or have more specific effects, like providing extra damage with high durability weapons.Omamori are obtained in two ways in Silent Hill f: by either finding them hidden throughout the game, or by rolling for them via the Shrine shop. In the Shrine shop, Omamori cost 400 Faith to start, increasing by 100 with each Omamori purchased. This caps at 1,000 Faith, with a total of 23 Omamori available via the shop. These appear to be given out randomly. The list of Shrine shop Omamori is listed up top, with the hidden Omamori listed afterwards in the order you can obtain them. Mild spoilers ahead.Only some hidden Omamori can be found on your first playthrough, while some are only available in New Game Plus. As of now, this guide only contains the inital playthrough hidden Omamori, but will be updated soon with the rest. There is one Omamori that is single use, the Blessed Hand Mirror. If used, you will be able to find another one at some point, but this one will be placed in your direct path at some point, you only need to collect one for it to count towards the collect all hidden Omamori achievement/trophy.Share this GalleryLatest Image GalleriesJump Space Tips - 8 Things You Need To Know Before You PlayAll Call Of Duty: Black Ops 7 Guns, Weapons, And Perks Available At LaunchAll Call Of Duty: Black Ops 7 Maps Available At LaunchShrine store OmamoriOmamori (Clam)Omamori (Plum)Omamori (Bamboo)Omamori (Sakura)Omamori (Owl)Omamori (Bear)Omamori (Mantis)Omamori (Boar)Omamori (Turtle)Omamori (Crab)Omamori (Kudzu Leaf)Omamori (Willow)Omamori (Butterfly)Omamori (Otter)Omamori (Serpent)Omamori (Beetle)Omamori (Camel)Omamori (Swordfish)Omamori (Dolphin)Omamori (Elephant)Omamori (Tanuki)Omamori (Weasel)Omamori (Daisy)Omamori (Whale)During the early sections after the initial fog monster attack, you will enter a house with a locked back door.

You need to head into that room and grab the back door keys. Head downstairs, out the back door, and down a ladder to find this Omamori.Omamori (Cat)In the Shrine Path where you need to complete the Shrine Vault Puzzle while you need to search for three specific emas, you need to look for a fourth one. It's found on a board in the southwestern part of the area, on the same board where you find one of the puzzle emas. You need to interact with an ema with an orange cat and blue background. On the back of it you will find the Cat Omamori.Omamori (Pine)On the way to Rinko's House, you will pass by the doctor's house, across from some fields. Head around the back of the house to find a ladder that can get you inside via the second floor.

After exploring the switching doors, you will ultimately have to solve a light puzzle by turning statues. Once you complete the puzzle, instead of returning to the Grand Hall, head back into the locker room here. A door in the back will now be open, which is where the Bull Omamori is located.Omamori (Horse)After completing the school section, you will venture into the mountains heading towards Shu's house. On the way there, after the section with the small lake, this is tucked in the corner just off the main path.Omamori (Crow)During the ritual sequence within the spirit realm after reaching Shu's house, you will receive a new arm. This arm allows you to open doors with small gaps in the frame, which will grant you access to this room in the northwest corner of the first floor.Omamori (Suzuran)After the ritual sequence, you will need to head down the mountain from Shu's towards town so you can head home. Partway down the mountain before reaching town, there is a small house near a blocked path. Around the back of the house in a breakable crate is the Omamori.Omamori (Spider)In an early town section, you will be in the farm fields on the eastern side of town. Take time to head to the shrine in the northern part of the farms, where you will obtain a key to the Sakuko's Mailbox. This is the house with the image of the pigtailed girl on the map, in the southwestern part of town. This area is accessible here, but you will be able to return later in the game, specifically after returning to Hinako's house.
