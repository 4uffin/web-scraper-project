Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 launches this November, and Activision has revealed tons of new information about the game's Zombies mode. This includes the full list of perks, ammo mods, and field upgrades found in Black Ops 7 Zombies, as well as all of the upgrades you can apply to each of them.Black Ops 7 Zombies features several Perk-a-Colas, field upgrades, and ammo mods that you can equip. The augment system also returns from Black Ops 6, so you can still upgrade these items to make them even more powerful, but there are a few changes to how the augments work, which we'll explain below.There are a whopping 192 augments available to unlock and equip at the game's launch, which are divided as follows:12 Perk-a-Colas with eight augments eachSix ammo mods with eight augments eachSix field upgrades with eight augments eachIt's also worth noting that many of the perks, field upgrades, and ammo mods return from Black Ops 6, and your progress on the augment upgrades will carry over. However, some augments have changed for returning items, and they will also have new augments to choose from as well.As seen in the images below, we highlight all of Black Ops 7's perks, field upgrades, and ammo mods, explaining how to unlock and use the augments for each one.Black Ops 7's Zombies launches with the largest round-based map ever, an upgradable Wonder Vehicle, a new Wonder Weapon, and the introduction of a zombie bear named Zursa.Share this GalleryLatest Image GalleriesHades 2 - All Keepsakes And How To Unlock ThemHades 2 - How To Unlock Animal Familiars And PetsHades 2 Arcana Guide And The Best Arcana Cards To UseHow augments work in Black Ops 7 ZombiesTo start researching an augment, you simply need to select an augment in the research menu and start earning XP in-game to make progress toward unlocking the augment.Each loadout item has two available augment slots: one for a major augment and one for a minor Augment. Each item has four major augments and four minor augments to choose from. A major augment offers a substantial advantage to the behavior of the item, while a minor augment offers a limited advantage to the item.New for Black Ops 7: If you unlock all eight augments for a specific item, you can then unlock the "Extra Slot" minor augment, which enables you to equip a second minor augment in-game.Unlocked augments can then be chosen before the start of a match for each individual perk, ammo mod, or field upgrade. This allows you to tailor the augments for your specific playstyle, such as roles for healing, being geared toward speed, or just dealing tons of damage.How Perk-a-Colas work in Black Ops 7 ZombiesThe perk drinks in Black Ops 7 mostly function as normal. Perk-a-Colas are purchased in-game using points called Essence. When knocked down, you will lose perks depending on how many you've obtained and how long you've been downed for.Additionally, there is no limit to how many perks you can have. You can obtain as many perks as there are available in a map.At launch, expect to access the following perks:Wisp Tea: This is the new perk in BO7.
