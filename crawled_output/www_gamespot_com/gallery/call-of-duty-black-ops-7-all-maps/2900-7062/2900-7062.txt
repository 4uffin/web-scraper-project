We now know what all of the Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 maps will be at launch, including which will be available during the game's upcoming betas. There are 18 in total, with six of those being released throughout the beta. Sixteen of those are Core 6v6 offering Call of Duty combat at its most recognizable, while two are 20v20 Skirmish zones that are designed for a more intense experience across a larger area. All maps offer a three-lane approach which allows for fast gunplay while thinking strategically.Six maps will debut throughout the Black Ops 7 beta, and 16 Core maps will be available at launch. Favorites such as Express, Hijacked, and Raid that featured in Black Ops 2 will return to the series with a rebuilt appearance for the game's 2035 setting. Below are all of the maps coming to Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 at launch, and we'll update this list whenever new maps are added to the game post-release:Blackheart (Beta)Cortex (Beta)Exposure (Beta)Imprint (Beta)The Forge (Beta)Toshin (Beta)ColossusDenFlagshipHomesteadParanoiaRetrievalScarExpress (Returning from Black Ops 2)Hijacked (Returning from Black Ops 2)Raid (Returning from Black Ops 2)Mission: Edge (Skirmish)Mission: Tide (Skirmish)Share this GalleryLatest Image GalleriesJump Space Tips - 8 Things You Need To Know Before You PlayAll Call Of Duty: Black Ops 7 Guns, Weapons, And Perks Available At LaunchSilent Hill F - All Omamori LocationsBlackheart Blackheart takes place on a drilling platform in the ocean, which will see close combat around the central drill as well as more open warfare on the surrounding barge. It's a small map, playable during the beta, and even features a dangerous grinder pit that could prove more lethal than the enemies you're trying to take down.CortexCortex is another small map that's playable during the beta. It's a laboratory set into the cliffside, which is doing experimental research. Huge vat chambers hold questionable test subjects, while an adjoining morgue and autopsy room are sure to provide some gruesome scenes. An extended underpass will play home to some territorial fighting, while the skybridge that overlooks the water will allow for more long-range gunplay.Exposure Exposure is a medium-sized map that's available during the beta. It's set in a solar plant installation in the Australian Outback, meaning most of the action takes place outdoors. There is a small interior control room as well as a suspended crate which allows you to jump across to a nearby ladder and gain the advantage of elevation. Thanks to the plentiful towers, storage, and pumps, you can expect plenty of cover. Imprint Playable during the beta, Imprint is a medium-sized map set in a cold, snowy robotics complex. The complex, which produces drones and battle tanks, has a large center area that splits into smaller corridors. Be careful of the deadly drops around the outside of the map. There's a handy control panel near the inclinator which will give you a lift through the snowy terrain.The ForgeAnother medium-sized map playable during the beta is The Forge. This is where the majority of The Guild's research and development for its technology is carried out. It's built on a harbor and, at first glance, looks client-friendly with product demonstrations and a modern lobby showcasing The Guild's work on autonomous weapons. There are two wings of The Forge that connect via covered walkways, while the central area has rotating walls that will provide alternating cover.ToshinSet in the neon-clad streets of a downtown shopping district, Toshin is a medium-sized map that's the sixth one playable during the Black Ops 7 beta. A monorail has derailed outside the station, and this strange addition to the otherwise polished environment offers plenty of cover and vantage points. You can take on enemies in the park or through the market, as well as encountering other urban hazards.Colossus Colossus is the first of the new maps that won't be playable until the full Black Ops 7 release date. It's a medium map and features a floating resort that has been heavily damaged and is slowly floating away from the shoreline. The atrium and bar offer close-ranged combat, while the main site of the outdoor wreckage features two wrecked helipads and the opportunity to engage from a distance.Den This Japanese compound houses The Guild and offers stunning views of the oriental surroundings. A large outdoor courtyard is the predominant area for engaging in gunfights, but there are paths toward the driveway, helipad, and conference room for more close-range warfare. A damaged roof that connects the garage to the armory will provide a test of your agility.Flagship Flagship is a smaller map, set underneath a giant aircraft carrier that's undergoing repairs. You can use the ascender to reach the upper areas, or move out from underneath to fight in the surrounding areas. Watch for the sparks flying as the mechanical arms work to repair the aircraft carrier above.Homestead Homestead offers stunning views of the Northern Lights over David Mason's Alaskan home. You can engage in combat in the cabin indoors, or use the outdoor terrain to flank enemies. There are various outbuildings offering useful vantage points, or risk hypothermia by diving into the freezing waters to reposition.ParanoiaParanoia, as its name suggests, is a small map set in a medical facility that occasionally offers psychedelic visions and floating objects. You might question whether you're imagining it--Paranoia could be just as deadly an environment as the enemies you're facing off against.RetrievalRetrieval is a large map set around a crash-landed Guild aircraft. The frozen tundra offers challenges of its own, but a convenient ice cavern grants opportunities for longshots, and discarded crates and underpasses give points to ambush unsuspecting enemies. ScarSet in a mountainside village, Scar is a medium map with plenty of tanks and military vehicles scattered around. Fight around the general store, health clinic, restaurant, and local carpentry business or ascend to the top of the motel's balcony for a better viewpoint. ExpressExpress is the first of three maps returning from Black Ops 2 with a visual overhaul for Black Ops 7's 2035 setting. Express is a high-speed train station, and under new management. You can use the tracks to engage enemies, take a higher viewpoint while putting yourself at risk on top of the parked train, or use the terminal for cover. There will be people staking out the control room, and you'll have to watch for passing trains.Hijacked Hijacked is another returning map from Black Ops 2. The superyacht's small size means there's constant action, and all lanes converge in the center deck. There are a few vantage points from each side to keep an eye on while retaining a close watch on your immediate surroundings. You can even descend to the engine room for truly close-up combat.Raid The final returning map is Raid, which takes place in an extravagant high-end Japanese mansion compound on the coast. The large courtyard and circular drive offer opportunities for longshots, while the interior of the house is set to take huge damage from the close-up gunfights taking place throughout it.Mission: EdgeThe first of two 20v20 Skirmish maps, Mission: Edge takes place in downtown Avalon. You can fight in and around hotels and cafes, towering apartment blocks, underpasses, courtyards, and parks. There are ascenders available to quickly reach high vantage points, or take the stairs for a more inconspicuous approach. There are vehicles available to assist your assault, whether that's to cover a lot of ground quickly in a helicopter, or outrun a sniper in a truck.Mission: TideThe second Skirmish map sees teams of 20 pitted against each other in Mission: Tide. This large-scale military compound is built on the coast of Avalon, but its environment couldn't be more different than the metropolis featured in Edge. Use the rocks on the shoreline as cover, or head into the compound via ascenders to rapidly get to the inner areas. There's an armory, mess hall, barracks, garages, and other structures to explore.
