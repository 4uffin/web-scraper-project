OD looks pretty spookyHideo Kojima has a number of upcoming projects in the works, including the Xbox-published horror game OD. During the Beyond the Strand event celebrating the 10th anniversary of Kojima Productions, Kojima himself debuted a terrifying new trailer for the game.The brand-new trailer includes redacted backstory text, so we don't know exactly what's happening and why--and that's pretty standard stuff for a Kojima game. Stephen King's It star Sophia Lillis plays the game's leading character, it looks like, and the cast will also include Udo Kier and Hunter Schafer. Details about their characters are unknown for now.OD doesn't currently have a release date, but it will be published by Xbox Game Studios, so it's expected to release on Xbox Series X|S and PC. While that doesn't necessarily rule out a PS5 release, that is yet to be confirmed.For now, you can check out 90+ images from the trailer in this gallery.Share this GalleryLatest Image GalleriesHades 2 - All Keepsakes And How To Unlock ThemHades 2 - How To Unlock Animal Familiars And PetsHades 2 Arcana Guide And The Best Arcana Cards To Use
