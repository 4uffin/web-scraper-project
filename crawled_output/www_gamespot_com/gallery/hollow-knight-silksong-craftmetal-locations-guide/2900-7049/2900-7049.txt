This unique resource is one of the most important in the game, as it allows you to purchase high-end items from vendors. That said, you also have to travel to different regions just to acquire the material.Where to find all Craftmetal in Hollow Knight: SilksongThere are eight Craftmetal resources in the game. A few of these can be purchased from merchants, but the rest are in far-flung locations. We've organized our guide to list down each main region.

It's sold by Pebb in Bone Bottom for 60x Rosaries. You can't miss her as she's smack dab along the main path.Craftmetal #2: The MarrowTo obtain this Craftmetal, you need to go to the right-hand side of The Marrow, just before the exits to other zones. Once there, look for magma rocks that you can hit. Doing so causes them to explode, revealing a short tunnel just below you.Craftmetal #3: Deep DocksThere are a couple of ways to obtain this Craftmetal:You can take the Far Fields exit that connects to Deep Docks.Alternatively, you can unlock the ornate door just to the east of the Forge Daughter's chamber by using a Simple Key.Either way, you'll come across a large chamber with floating enemies and platforms. The goal is to hit the wooden platform, which causes the rocks to fall. This lets you access a nook with a chest.Craftmetal #4: Blasted StepsThis Hollow Knight: Silksong Craftmetal can be found in Blasted Steps:From the fast travel station/bench, keep going to the right until you reach a large open area with a bunch of sand worms.As you're making your way to the right--i.e. the upper path to Grand Gate--look below you.You'll notice a narrow opening between patches of sand worm-infested dunes. Float down and go to the left to pick up this item.Craftmetal #5: UnderworksThis location is actually directly below The Cauldron, the area where you obtain the Clawline grappling hook. Keep heading across the corridor while avoiding the lava flows, searing hot platforms, and flying enemies.Craftmetal #6: Wisp ThicketTrying to get this particular Craftmetal item takes a bit of effort. Basically, you need to go to the part of Wisp Thicket that has ledges and netted structures. There's a hidden passageway at the top, so just keep climbing until you reach the cavern's ceiling. The Craftmetal node is to the right.If you go directly to the left of the Craftmetal, you'll be able to destroy a breakable wall. There's another secret path here that takes you to an area with deadly traps, but there's a Lost Flea that you could rescue that the very end.Craftmetal #7: Choral Chamber Songclave - JubilanaYou can purchase a piece of Craftmetal from a merchant named Jubilana for 180x Rosaries. However, the item only shows up in her inventory once you've completed her quests. You can learn more about these details in our Wandering Merchant/Lost Merchant guide.Craftmetal #8: Putrefied DuctsThere's one more piece of Craftmetal in Hollow Knight: Silksong, and it's at the very edge of the map in the Putrefied Ducts. Make your way to the lower-right corner past the Flea Caravan area. Swim across the pool of water and jump up the small nook at the top.Where to use your Craftmetal?As mentioned earlier, you can use Craftmetal to buy all sorts of goodies from vendors:The Forge Daughter in Deep Docks and Twelfth Architect in the Underworks have several wares for sale in exchange for Rosaries and Craftmetal.You may also create a unique variant of the Silkshot, which is limited to one item per playthrough.There are a few crafting tables/workstations in specific areas, and these net you tools or gear pieces.That does it for our guide on where to find all Craftmetal in Hollow Knight: Silksong.
