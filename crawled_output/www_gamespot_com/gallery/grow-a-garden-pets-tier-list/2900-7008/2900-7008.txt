The key to making a fortune in Grow A Garden is which of the many pets you have in the active slots. You can only have a few roaming your garden at any time, but once you’ve let the critters loose, you’ll find that they’ll benefit your garden every time they activate their abilities. So when there’s a huge variety being added every time, it’s handy to have a tier list of the best ones available at all times.Of course, having developer permissions or the right contacts in one of the best Roblox games may bestow upon you the very best pets--all done with a simple entry of one of the many Grow A Garden cheats and console commands. But for everyone else, you need to participate in events and save up enough resources to buy the correct egg or craft the relevant crate to get the very best Grow a Garden pets.Share this GalleryLatest Image GalleriesSee 40+ Images Of Kojima's Terrifying New Xbox Game, ODBest Lethal Company Mods To Enjoy With The Group Chat In 2025Best Fallout: New Vegas Mods To Download In 2025The best Grow A Garden PetsThere are over 150 animals, dinosaurs, and mythical beasts available to give a home in your garden, each having an ability scales in power depending on the rarity. You can hatch them via eggs, open crates, craft them, and buy them through specialist shops with event currency. Not all pets are available right now, but they may return in future events. This list will consist of every available pet in the game’s history.Here is our Grow A Garden Pets tier list:TierPetsSMimic Octopus, Golem, Spaghetti Sloth, Disco Bee, Raiju, Spinosaurus, T-Rex, Lobster Thermidor, Golden Goose, Griffin, Kitsune, Corrupted Kitsune, Apple Gazelle, Phoenix, Lemon Lion, Sugar Glider, Space Squirrel, Red PandaAParasaurolophus, Kodama, Corrupted Kodama, Tanuki, Sushi Bear, Praying Mantis, Squirrel, Bear Bee, Hamster, Cooked Owl, Hyacinth Macaw, Tanchozuru, Raptor, Dilophosaurus, Pterodactyl, Koi, Chicken Zombie, Junkbot, Red Fox, Dragonfly, Queen Bee, Raccoon, Fennec Fox, Peach Wasp, Drake, Luminous Sprite, Swan, Mallard, SeedlingBWasp, Tarantula Hawk, Scarlet Macaw, Peacock, Polar Bear, Mandrake, Bald Eagle, Sand Snake, Meerkat, Pachycephalosaurus, Triceratops, Stegosaurus, Gorilla Chef, Hotdog Daschund, Giant Ant, Butterfly, Owl, Blood Kiwi, Night Owl, Axolotl, Brontosaurus, Kappa, Mochi Mouse, Blood Owl, French Fry Ferret, Wisp, Imp, Green Bean, Red Squirrel, WoodpeckerCChicken, Sunny-side Chicken, Bacon Pig, Toucan, Sea Turtle, Orangutan, Seal, Pig, Rooster, Kiwi, Pancake Mole, Caterpillar, Snail, Bee, Jackalope, Honey Bee, Pixie, Petal Bee, Moth, Ostrich, Cabybara, Cow, Sea Otter, Turtle, Mole, Frog, Moon Cat, Iguanodon, Football, Brown Mouse, Pack Bee, Glimmering Sprite, Echo Frog, Ankylosaurus, Cardinal, Gnomed, Shroomie, Badger, Grizzly Bear, Barn Owl, Chipmunk, Marmot, SalmonDBunny, Black Bunny, Dog, Golden Lab, Starfish, Crab, Seagull, Ladybug, Dairy Cow, Bagel Bunny, Cat, Deer, Elk, Shiba Inu, Maneki-neko, Flamingo, Orange Tabby, Spotted Deer, Monkey, Hedgehog, Grey Mouse, Silver Monkey, Panda, Blood HedgehogFNihonzaru, RobinAs for which ones are the best, you need to look at which ones either give you the most money when you sell them, or the ones that grant your plants the best Grow A Garden mutations. The Disco Bee is the pet with the best multiplier that’s always available.In addition, there are pets with unique effects such as copying other pets’ abilities (Mimic Octopus), spreading mutations (Spinosaurus and T-Rex), and tinkering with the Mutation Machine (Golem) that are simply too good to ignore. Their effects will nearly always buff your garden the longer they remain in the active slot, so they’re worth keeping out.Outside of the S-tier, you’ll find effects to increase the growth rate or size of your plants or grant pets experience. Mutations with lower values appear here and are plenty decent enough if you can’t get hold of the top-tier ones. As the rarity becomes more common, you’ll find that the tiers your pets are in will be in the lower tiers, where their perks are so minor that you’ll barely notice them.While most pets do at least something, the Nihonzaru has been nerfed so hard that it is an inhabitant of the F tier. This is because it had its multiplier buffing ability removed during the 1.77.1 update, and is now effectively useless. The new Robin also joins it in the F tier, as all it changes is the player's height, a rather meaningless effect.All Grow A Garden pets and effectsIn this list, some pets are now unobtainable as their eggs were distributed as part of an event. However, if you somehow held onto the eggs, you would still be able to hatch them, potentially getting one of these rarer pets.
