Jump Space is a sci-fi co-op adventure where you and some friends can team up to operate your very own spaceship and explore the vastness of space. You'll need to salvage materials, keep your ship in working order, and also stay alive. In this guide, we'll provide some beginner tips to help you survive your interstellar travel in Jump Space.It's also worth noting that Jump Space is currently in early access for PC and Xbox Series X. The game already has plenty of content, but Keepsake Games laid out the roadmap for Jump Space, which details plans for an expanded story, new missions, photo mode, and other new features.Share this GalleryLatest Image GalleriesSee 40+ Images Of Kojima's Terrifying New Xbox Game, ODBest Lethal Company Mods To Enjoy With The Group Chat In 2025Best Fallout: New Vegas Mods To Download In 2025Materia is an important resourceMateria is the main resource of the game, and you'll want to constantly collect a supply of it. This is what you'll need in order to craft important ship parts, make repair kits, replenish ammo, trade with merchants, and even revive your fallen teammates.This resource is most simply found in glowing blue canisters, as you are introduced to in the tutorial. It can also be gained by tossing unwanted items into the dissembler machine, and you can collect it while piloting your ship by flying through the glowing blue clouds left behind by enemy ships you've destroyed. An example of this blue cloud can be seen in the image above.Get familiar with your shipThe tutorial does a decent job of teaching you the basics of the game's movement, combat, and ship navigation, but it can take a while to get yourself familiar with every nook and cranny of your ship. Taking a wrong turn while your ship is on fire or under attack can be costly. Make sure you always know the fastest route back to the pilot seat or where to locate your fire extinguishers.For example, there is a fire extinguisher just outside the doorway that leads to the ship's bridge with the pilot seat. Make sure to return the extinguisher to its original location when you're finished. However, if lost, you can also craft additional fire extinguishers using Materia.Communicate and assign rolesJump Space is essentially a cooperative game, and while there aren't really assigned roles, it might be best to designate jobs for teammates. Maybe you're the better pilot and another teammate is best for extinguishing fires while under pressure. You'll also want someone who can man the gunner for the defense turrets. Regardless, communicate what everyone is doing so all the necessary roles are filled.Know what you can and can't keepYou can collect plenty of items and resources on your missions in Jump Space, but many lootables won't carry over between missions.Your weapons, ammo, and healing items don't carry over between missions. So, if you see a cool rocket launcher or LMG you want to try, use it before you lose it.Ship components will carry over, so if you find some on your mission and send it to your ship, you'll be able to access it in your hangar after the mission ends.Use and upgrade your artifactsArtifacts are found randomly while looting on your explorations. There are two types you can find: Cosmetic and Perk artifacts.Artifacts you want to keep must be placed inside your ship's artifact slots, or they will be destroyed at the end of your mission. There are perk artifacts that can benefit your crew or your ship, so pick ones that cater to your playstyle. There seem to be several, but they include perks like health for crewmates, extra damage for ship weapons, and shield buffs.Unwanted artifacts can be used to upgrade the artifacts installed in the artifact slots. Artifacts you installed into the ship can also be destroyed by using the red button at the bottom of the slot.Make use of your grappleMake sure you're utilizing your grapple for faster movement. Sometimes your ship will get damaged, and you'll need to quickly move around the outside and repair your shields. Or maybe you're away from the ship, and the remaining crew members on board are in trouble. The grapple is your friend.Explore beyond the main objectivesMost missions will have a main objective as well as additional points of interest marked on your map. Read the intel card (as shown in the image above) for each location to see what loot opportunity you'll have there. You can just breeze right through to the main objective site, but then you'll miss out on rare loot like the map chart fragments or artifacts.Don't be afraid to fly soloJump Space is designed as a co-op experience, but you can play the game solo. This is made possible with the Buddy bot, who will automatically join you on missions. This bot will help you fight off enemies on the ground, revive you, and even operate the ship's turret system to assist you in aerial fights.
