As if September weren't busy enoughThe Game Pass library is about to be updated with more games soon, as Microsoft has announced a big batch of new additions to its subscription service. Right now, you can test out your skills in repairing towns and roads with RoadCraft, and starting September 17, you can pick up the Vampire Survivors-like Deep Rock Galactic: Survivors when it exits early access, command Captain Price and Task Force 141 in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, and manage your kingdom in the chaotic city builder Overthrown.While Hades 2 will be a timed console exclusive for Switch 2 and Switch consoles, you can also grab the first--and excellent--game in the series on September 19 when it returns to Game Pass. For something more cerebral, you can check out the city-building strategy game Frostpunk 2 later this month when it debuts on console, and Endless Legend 2 will be a day-one launch on Game Pass. Feel like doing some globe-trotting? Then you can join Peppa Pig and her family as they tour various countries like the US, Italy, and Australia. Who knows, Peppa might learn how to whistle on her international journey.Other highlights this month include the return of the iconic JRPG series Mana with Visions of Mana, the very good puzzle-action game Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light, and the day-one launch of Sopa: Tale of the Stolen Potato, a touching narrative-adventure inspired by Latin America. Game Pass Core is also being updated with three more games on October 1. Lastly, several games will be leaving Game Pass on September 30, so you only have a few more days left to play several action-packed titles from the Ninja Gaiden series.
