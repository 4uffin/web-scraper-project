There is no shortage of Diablo-like video games to play in 2025. The dungeon-crawling RPG series has been an iconic part of gaming as a pioneer in Western RPGs, setting a foundation for others to follow and build upon. Diablo 2 created an entire subgenre of similar titles originally referred to as action-RPGs (Diablo pioneered and popularized real-time combat in isometric computer RPGs) but are now more commonly called ARPGs to avoid confusion with behind-the-back action-RPGs like The Witcher 3. Regardless of what term you use to describe them, these isometric RPGs all aim to recreate Diablo's satisfying gameplay loop with an emphasis on dungeon crawling, monster slaying, character-enhancing loot, and multiplayer features. However, it's definitely fair to say that some Diablo-likes are better than others.In case you're looking for something to scratch the Diablo itch, we've selected our favorites in the action-RPG genre. From well-known homages like Torchlight 2 to lesser-known fare like Victor Vran, we've covered nearly all the games in this style that you'd ever want to play. We've even honed in on a few selections that deliver some of the same thrills without quite fitting into its exact genre niche. The next time you feel that urge to grind, give one of these a try. You might be surprised how much you like it.Meanwhile, the Diablo franchise itself is as varied as this list, with Diablo 2, 3, 4 and even the mobile title Diablo Immortal each offering their flavor of demon-slaying and loot hunting. Diablo 4 is on Xbox Game Pass, so you can play it as part of your subscription. The Vessel of Hatred expansion isn't included in the Game Pass version, but your subscription includes a discount for it. Blizzard additionally remade Diablo 2 in the form of 2021's Diablo 2: Resurrected, for those who prefer a more old-school dive into the genre. You can also check out the best Game Pass games, as well as tons of other great dungeon-crawlers.Share this GalleryLatest Image GalleriesHades 2 - All Keepsakes And How To Unlock ThemHades 2 - How To Unlock Animal Familiars And PetsHades 2 Arcana Guide And The Best Arcana Cards To UseThe AscentDeveloper: Neon GiantRelease Date: July 29, 2021Platforms: PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|SGenre: Twin-Stick Shooter ARPGMultiplayer: Four-player Co-opThis dungeon-crawler is notable mostly for its setting, which is about as far from the traditional swords and sorcery as you can get. The Ascent adopts a cyberpunk aesthetic, and instead of descending into the depths of a dungeon, you're actually climbing up a massive corporate tower. Your usual suite of spell-like powers are represented by high-tech gadgets, and you can climb the tech tree and customize a cyberdeck to your liking. It does focus more on ranged combat than many other Diablo-likes, since every build uses guns by default, but the enemy design is well-tuned for that purpose. And like the best dungeon crawlers, you can play with up to three friends to take down cyber-threats cooperatively.Read our The Ascent review.See at FanaticalFeatured in this ImageThe Ascent%gameName%Get the latest news and videos for this game daily, no spam, no fuss.

You're Good to Go!We'll begin emailing you updates about %gameName%.FollowDarksiders: GenesisDeveloper: Airshop SyndicateRelease Date: December 5, 2019Platforms: PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, MobileGenre: Action RPGMultiplayer: Two-player Co-opA lesser-known spin-off of the Darksiders franchise, Genesis is an isometric hack-and-slash game with co-op support and tons of enemies to slay. It's less of an RPG than other games on this list, with fewer mechanics to explore, and not much in the way of proper builds. However, a lot of players feel that it's one of the best games in the franchise, perhaps even better than some of the mainline entries. This is definitely a game that is best picked up on sale for a weekend play with a friend, and it excels in that situation.Read our Darksiders: Genesis review.See at FanaticalFeatured in this ImageDarksiders Genesis%gameName%Get the latest news and videos for this game daily, no spam, no fuss.

Unlike most games in the genre, Grim Dawn doesn't have randomized enemy camps and dungeons, instead opting for a hand-designed approach. Players praise it for its replayability and variety of builds, while also noting substantial support from developer Crate Entertainment and a vibrant mod scene that continues to this day. If you missed it on its original release in 2016, it's worth a look.Read our Grim Dawn review.See at HumbleFeatured in this ImageGrim Dawn%gameName%Get the latest news and videos for this game daily, no spam, no fuss.

You're Good to Go!We'll begin emailing you updates about %gameName%.FollowHadesDeveloper: Supergiant GamesRelease Date: December 6, 2018Platforms: PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo SwitchGenre: Action RoguelikeMultiplayer: NoneThe roguelike Hades isn't a loot-driven RPG like the Diablo games, but its thrilling action combat and emphasis on crafting a build delivers some of the same satisfaction in a run-based package. Though you'll earn permanent boosts, much of the enjoyment of Hades involves selecting from a wide array of weapons and upgrades as you descend through the bowels of the underworld, giving an accelerated and repeatable experience of crafting your build. The combat itself is slick and fast-paced, and the enemy variety will keep you on your toes. Hades 2, currently in early access, introduces a new protagonist with her own playstyle, which should be more than enough to keep you on your toes.Read our Hades review.See at SteamFeatured in this ImageHades%gameName%Get the latest news and videos for this game daily, no spam, no fuss.

The auto-shooter survival genre popularized by Vampire Survivors attracted many imitators, and Halls of Torment takes that concept and applies it to a Diablo 2-like setting and style. You'll still go on quick roguelike runs that almost inevitably lead to your own demise, but as you do, you'll chip away at upgrades to make your barbarian or archer that much heartier. If you want a Diablo fix mixed with the quick bite-sized play of a Survivor-like, this is a great mix that compels you to play just one more time, over and over.See at SteamFeatured in this ImageHalls of Torment%gameName%Get the latest news and videos for this game daily, no spam, no fuss.

There's no complex build diagrams or multi-phase bosses requiring in-depth strategies here--just a lot of hacking, slashing, and watching the numbers go up. It's certainly one of the better-looking games on this list, as the voxel aesthetic of Minecraft stands out in the field, and its lighting is especially impressive. It's not a hardcore experience, but if you're looking for a grindfest that you can play with anybody, Minecraft Dungeons is very much in that ballpark.Read our Minecraft Dungeons review.See at HumbleFeatured in this ImageMinecraft Dungeons%gameName%Get the latest news and videos for this game daily, no spam, no fuss.

Developed by a team of Diablo fans who were frustrated by the lack of new games in the genre in the early 2010s, Path Of Exile appeals the most to players who value depth of content over all else, as the game has received ten years of regular updates from developer Grinding Gear Games. A sequel, Path Of Exile 2, is currently scheduled to release in November. Even with the early-access launch of Path Of Exile 2, the original will continue to receive new seasonal updates, with many cosmetics and quality-of-life microtransactions (like additional stash tabs) carrying over between games.Read our Path of Exile review.See at SteamFeatured in this ImagePath of Exile%gameName%Get the latest news and videos for this game daily, no spam, no fuss.

You're Good to Go!We'll begin emailing you updates about %gameName%.FollowPath Of Exile 2Developer: Grinding Gear GamesRelease Date: December 6, 2024 (Early Access)Platforms: PC, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5Multiplayer: Six-player Co-opPath Of Exile 2 may be in early access and currently only feature half of its campaign and character classes, but it's already a content for one of the best ARPGs ever made. It shares a lot of DNA with its predecessor but manages to carve out its own place in history thanks to its fantastic presentation and more methodical (at least for the first several dozen hours) combat that puts a heavy focus on From Software-style boss battles. It also takes some of the more confusing and frustrating aspects of the original Path Of Exile, like skill gems, and presents them in a new, more beginner-friendly system that still features loads of depth for those who love fine-tuning builds for maximum efficiency. Though its punishing endgame may not be to the liking of some, its campaign, even in its half-finished state, is a must-play for any who consider themselves an ARPG aficionado. The early access version of Path Of Exile 2 costs $30, but the game will eventually be free-to-play.See at SteamFeatured in this ImagePath of Exile 2%gameName%Get the latest news and videos for this game daily, no spam, no fuss.

You're Good to Go!We'll begin emailing you updates about %gameName%.FollowTitan Quest 2Developer: Grimlore GamesRelease Date: August 1, 2025 (Early Access)Platforms: PC (Early Access)Genre: Action RPGMultiplayer: Still in early stages but due in full releaseWhile Titan Quest 2 is still in Early Access on Steam, the game reportedly sold more than 300,000 copies in its first three days. The appetite for a follow up to 2006's Titan Quest is clearly sizable, and the fan response so far has been positive. When the game releases fully, hopefully by the end of 2026, Titan Quest 2 will also be available on PS5 and Xbox Series X.It doesn't get much more epic than Greek mythology, and Titan Quest 2 puts you right in between the gods, to do battle with and alongside these all-powerful beings, as well as featuring famous villains from the ancient world like centaurs, gryphons, and cyclopes. Like Diablo, there's plenty of roleplay between bursts of frenzied battle, as you choose your own class, gear up, and forge relationships with allies and enemies throughout.See at FanaticalFeatured in this ImageTitan Quest II%gameName%Get the latest news and videos for this game daily, no spam, no fuss.

They combined the satisfying mob-killing action that made the series so enjoyable with a simpler approach that appeals to those who were scared away by the relatively complex builds and strategies required for the Diablo games. Torchlight 2 improved on every aspect of the original and is generally considered the peak of the series, though the new Torchlight Infinite is worth a look if you're interested in a live service version with a gacha system. Torchlight 2 also has a successful mod scene if you don't mind doing some research.Read our Torchlight 2 review.See at FanaticalFeatured in this ImageTorchlight II%gameName%Get the latest news and videos for this game daily, no spam, no fuss.

Like Minecraft Dungeons, it doesn't require a build guide or hundreds of hours of grinding to reach the end, though it does have a substantial endgame with fancy loot. The game is also surprisingly hard on the higher difficulties, but not so much that it requires you to look up a guide online. If you're looking for a forever ARPG like the Diablo series or Path of Exile, Victor Vran isn't for you, but it's a great game to play with a friend over a weekend if you want to relax.Read our Victor Vran review.See at HumbleFeatured in this ImageVictor Vran%gameName%Get the latest news and videos for this game daily, no spam, no fuss.

As a result, you need to avoid certain dangers like sunlight and make sure you constantly feed on the blood of NPCs, and as you progress you'll even begin building and customizing your own castle. As you build up your array of vampiric powers, the isometric combat bears a striking resemblance to Diablo's mage-casters, and you can put your skills to the test against an array of gruesome bosses.See at FanaticalFeatured in this ImageV Rising%gameName%Get the latest news and videos for this game daily, no spam, no fuss.

Battling against an assortment of Xenos and other vicious enemies, you make use of classic Warhammer 40,000 abilities and weapons, including the legendary chainsword. Being able to slaughter endless waves of enemies--heretics who defy the Emperor of Mankind--is very satisfying, even if the game's campaign lacks the variety of some of the other games on this list.See at SteamFeatured in this ImageWarhammer 40,000: Inquisitor - Martyr%gameName%Get the latest news and videos for this game daily, no spam, no fuss.

It may be less complex than Warhammer 40K: Inquisitor - Martyr, but it's still a fun (albeit more casual) romp through the Warhammer setting, with satisfying gameplay, unique boss fights, and five (or six, if you buy the Witcher Hunter DLC) different classes to choose from, including the iconic dwarven Slayer. Each class feels distinct yet still easy to pick up and play, and in addition to unique active and passive abilities, every class sports a special Bloodlust "ultimate" style ability that charges by defeating enemies that can be used to devastating effect. It can be lacking in terms of enemy variety and its story isn't exactly riveting, but Warhammer: Chaosbane still manages to be a fun distraction, especially when played with friends.See at FanaticalFeatured in this ImageWarhammer: Chaosbane%gameName%Get the latest news and videos for this game daily, no spam, no fuss.

It's easy to see why. 11th Hour Games clearly is a fan of the genre and put a ton of thought into Last Epoch's systems, with one great example being how it solves the longstanding ARPG debate over whether to play with item trading or going the solo self-found route with its unique Trade Factions system. Toss in five base classes (each with three Mastery classes to evolve into), highly customizable skill upgrade trees for the game's more than 120 skills, an excellent crafting system, and seasonal updates, and there is plenty of ARPG goodness for fans of the genre to sink their teeth into here.See at FanaticalHell ClockDeveloper: Rogue SnailRelease Date: July 22, 2025Platforms: PCGenre: Roguelike ARPGMultiplayer: NoneHell Clock is a snappy and complex new release, combining all the best bits of roguelikes and dungeon crawlers with that of detailed RPG gameplay. Although it has the overtones of dark fantasy you want from the best games like Diablo, Hell Clock is also grounded in the very real War of Canudos, a seismic event in Brazil's rich history, which took place in the 1890s. This mix of historic fact with magical fiction creates a unique setting with plenty of lore to get stuck into.Like Diablo, Hell Clock's risk/reward ratio is well-balanced, with big risks meaning even bigger payoffs (or punishments). One minute you feel invincible, and the next you're dead.See at SteamFeatured in this ImageHell Clock%gameName%Get the latest news and videos for this game daily, no spam, no fuss.

Its vibe and isometric combat focus is a treat for Diablo fans, but it has plenty of its own unique content to offer.Players can choose their preferred class, which translates into playstyle and card decks. Card decks are split into items, spells, and artifacts, with multiple variants and rarities therein. Mostly confined to the labyrinthine, procedurally-generated tunnels under the cathedral, you'll fight to destroy an ancient evil, surfacing only to snatch tidbits of lore from gossiping NPCs above ground. Your skills in combat are reflected in monthly public leaderboards, adding a little more competition to the process.See at FanaticalFeatured in this ImageBook of Demons%gameName%Get the latest news and videos for this game daily, no spam, no fuss.
