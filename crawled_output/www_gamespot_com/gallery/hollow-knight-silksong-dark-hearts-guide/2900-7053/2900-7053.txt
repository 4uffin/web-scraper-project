We've got you covered with our guide, but be forewarned that there are spoilers ahead.How to complete Dark Hearts in Hollow Knight: Silksong - Void Masses locations guideDark Hearts is a quest that's only available during Act 3 of the campaign. That means you need to complete the Silk and Soul quest during Act 2 to have access to the next chapter. Here's what you can expect:The Dark Hearts wish comes from the wish board in Bellhart. You're tasked with destroying 12 Void Masses. These look like mish-mashed amalgamations of various creatures, all cobbled together by black goop.The presence of a Void Mass is usually denoted by corrupted enemies in the same area. These hostiles tend to have a shadowy hue and they have new attacks.Void Masses can also deal damage to Hornet. These entities use their tendrils to attack in melee and they fire black ooze from a distance.There are more than 12 Void Masses in the game. Some regions even have three or more of these targets.Share this GalleryLatest Image GalleriesJump Space Tips - 8 Things You Need To Know Before You PlayAll Call Of Duty: Black Ops 7 Guns, Weapons, And Perks Available At LaunchAll Call Of Duty: Black Ops 7 Maps Available At LaunchVoid Masses in The Marrow and MosshomeIf you want to quickly complete the Hollow Knight: Silksong Dark Hearts quest, then your best bet is to check out The Marrow.
