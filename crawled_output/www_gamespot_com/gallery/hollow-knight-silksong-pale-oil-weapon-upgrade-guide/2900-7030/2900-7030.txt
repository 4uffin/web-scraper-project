He's located in the settlement of Bellhart, which is halfway between the regions of Greymoor and Shellwood.Plinney and the rest of the citizens of Bellhart won't appear right from the get-go. That's because the town is afflicted with a curse. To remove it, you must defeat a boss named the Widow, who resides in the upper reaches of Bellhart.

This material is what's used to upgrade your weapon further past the first tier.You can obtain one in the Whispering Vaults sub-zone of the Citadel. At the left-hand side, there's a large room with several crates. The goal is to strike the crates to create a passageway that leads to the exit to the left. Pay attention to the horizontal and vertical beams in the background, as these represent where the crates can move toward when hit.Needle upgrade #3: Choral Chamber - Great Taste of PharloomThere's another Pale Oil that can be yours if you complete a quest called Great Taste of Pharloom.
