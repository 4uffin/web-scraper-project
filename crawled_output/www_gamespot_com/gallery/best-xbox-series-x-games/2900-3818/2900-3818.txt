Whether you're looking for something new to play via the Game Pass subscription service or need buying advice for your next full game purchase, this list of games will steer you in the right direction.Most, but not all, of the games we've chosen are available on Xbox Game Pass.

Alan Wake 2 is the sequel 13 years in the making, and it delivers. The story follows the author Alan Wake and FBI agent Saga Anderson through a mind-bending dual campaign. It leans more into horror than its predecessor and contains some truly unforgettable moments.Read our Alan Wake 2 review.See on Xbox StoreAlan Wake RemasteredWhile it might be a stretch to call Alan Wake underrated, it definitely didn't receive the massive audience that it deserved when it originally launched in 2010. Hopefully Alan Wake Remastered (and the rousing success of its sequel) will change that. The action-adventure game stars a thriller novelist whose wife disappears while they are on vacation. Things really start to get weird when plot points from a novel he doesn't remember writing start happening in real life. The remaster gives the wonderful written game a fresh look and adds some new secrets to uncover. It's worth playing whether you experienced the original or not and the gameplay holds up remarkably well.Read our Alan Wake Remastered review.See on Xbox StoreAssassin's Creed ShadowsAssassin's Creed has always approximated the experience of being a stealthy ninja, so it was only a matter of time before the series went to Japan. Assassin's Creed Shadows is set in feudal Japan, with a split narrative that lets you sneak as the stealthy shinobi Naoe or bust through doors as the tank-like samurai Yasuke. The landscape of Japan looks beautiful, letting you explore pastoral landscapes in-between your missions to hunt and mete out justice on those who wronged you.Read our Assassin's Creed Shadows review.See at AmazonAvowedThe studio behind The Outer Worlds has been busy. Not only is a sequel to its sci-fi RPG due later this year, but it delved back into a fantasy setting this year with Avowed as well. Obsidian's latest doesn't quite have as many deep and interlocking systems as similar-looking games like Fallout and Elder Scrolls, but it's a refined take that lets you skip to the fun and customize your character's combat to your liking. It's some of the best first-person RPG combat around, and definitely worth a try on that basis alone. Plus it takes place in the Pillars of Eternity universe, helping flesh out that universe for fans.Read our Avowed review.See at AmazonBlue PrinceBlue Prince is an incredible puzzle adventure game that is bound to stay with you for a long time. As the inheritor of the stately Mount Holly manor, you are tasked with reaching the mysterious Room 46 in order to keep your new property. But this is no ordinary mansion, as the layout of rooms shifts every day. Each time you open a door you determine which room will be "drafted" on the other side, letting you create your own pathway. But as you learn more about the house, and how the rooms and their systems interact, you'll learn there's much more to Mount Holly than meets the eye.Read our Blue Prince review.See on the Xbox StoreCall of Duty: Black Ops 6The Call of Duty series has been among the top sellers for years, but some CoD games are clearly better than others. This year's iteration, Black Ops 6, is the best the series has been in some time. The campaign is a smart and varied action spectacle that keeps you on your toes as it explores paranoid thriller tropes set against global events in the 1990s. Meanwhile, the multiplayer's new omni-movement makes matches feel fast and fluid, especially with the addition of inventive new maps that let you explore the space in a variety of ways. A revision to the perks system helps you specialize in interesting ways. Call of Duty has earned its reputation for a reason, and this latest release shows why. This is also the first year that the newest Call of Duty has been available on Game Pass at launch, so if you're a subscriber to Xbox's signature service you can hop right in.Read our Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 campaign review and multiplayer review.See at AmazonClair Obscur: Expedition 33There's a lot to love about Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, from its exquisite art direction through to its elegant marriage of turn-based RPG and souls-like influences, but one of the factors that makes it so mesmerizing is that it's consistently satisfying to play. Whether you're pumping your fist in delight after you execute a perfect series of parries or you're reeling from the emotional rollercoaster of its story, Expedition 33 will keep your eyes glued to it whenever you boot it up to continue your journey across its beautiful world.Read our Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 review.Control Ultimate editionWhen Control originally launched in 2019, it seemed to be too taxing for console hardware. The next-gen release of Control: Ultimate edition remedies these issues. On Xbox Series X, Control can run in 4K, and it retains a steady 60fps. Alternatively, you can enable a graphics mode (not available on Series S) that runs at 30fps with ray tracing. Either option looks great, especially when making use of Jesse's powers. Control is a narrative-focused action game revolving around a mysterious government agency that investigates supernatural activity. With excellent and varied gameplay that feeds into the well-written tale, Control is one of the best action games in recent memory.Read our Control review.See on Xbox StoreDead SpaceDead Space spent years as a revered but dormant franchise, and a symbol of the types of games EA put out in the late-aughts. This remake took what was great about the original and modernized it, not just in terms of visual style but with smart revisions. The result is a game that effectively introduces Dead Space's unique, body horror style of action to a new generation of gamers. Slicing limbs off of necromorphs has never been so gross--or felt so satisfying.Read our Dead Space review.See at AmazonDestiny 2: The Final ShapeThe long-running live-service multiplayer game Destiny 2 has been going strong since 2017, but this may be among the best times in its entire history to jump in. After multiple expansions, Bungie has reached The Final Shape--the promised closing chapter of the story that has been building since launch--so you can now see how the story concludes its first saga and prepares for more to come. And with tons of past expansions, raids, cooperative play, PvP, and the Crucible, you'll never run out of things to do and new power combos to test. Destiny 2 also runs in 4K at 60fps on Xbox Series X and load times are drastically quicker than past generations where Destiny launched, which is a big deal for a game that has a decent number of loading screens.Read our Destiny 2: The Final Shape review.See on Xbox StoreDoom: The Dark Ages is an intoxicating blast of unrelenting brutality. Once all the gears start meshing and you've built up an arsenal of weapons powerful enough to level the solar system, the game becomes an overpowerfantasy as you slam the metaphorical pedal to the death metal soundtrack and bulldoze your way through the worst that Hell can throw at you. The flow-state of combat keeps you perched forward on your couch--if you've fine-tuned the difficulty to nail the balance of power and challenge--and solid first-person action alongside mechanized warfare sweetens the over-the-top action you'll gleefully throw the Doom Slayer into.Read our Doom: The Dark Ages review.See at AmazonElden Ring: Shadow of the ErdtreeFrom Software's Elden Ring is a masterpiece in open-world game design. With an absolutely massive world teeming with secrets, scenic vistas, and an almost overwhelming amount of activities to complete, Elden Ring was the defining game of 2022. Now the long-anticipated Shadow of the Erdtree expansion has been released, and it is once again an arresting and incredible action experience with seemingly boundless freedom to explore its massive landscape. Both the lore and the suite of gameplay opportunities have been greatly expanded, giving players new story details to explore and weapons to master. The combat is once again a challenge that will test even the most-experienced Tarnish to hone their skills and explore The Lands Between.Read our Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree review.See at AmazonThe Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion RemasteredOblivion Remastered is a prime example of how nostalgia remains one of the most powerful forces in existence. It's also a new gold standard for what a remaster can be, as Bethesda Game Studios and Virtuos Studios have pulled out all the stops to improve on the original game and polish up some of its rougher spots, modernizing it for a new audience while making certain that enough of its signature jankiness has been kept intact. It's a perfectly imperfect RPG adventure that looks better than ever.Read our The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered review.Forza Horizon 5Playground Games is, hands down, the most consistent studio within the Xbox family, and the UK-based developer has been doing it for a decade without getting the recognition it deserves. Forza Horizon 5 just happens to be the best game it's ever made, taking drivers to a gorgeous and environmentally diverse Mexico filled with races to complete, challenges to try out, and hundreds of cars to earn. What makes Forza Horizon 5 so wonderful is that it fully embraces the core pillar of every great open-world game: choice. Do succeed, you can essentially play the game however you want, whether that's taking part in cross-country marathons or just jumping all the danger signs you can find. There's no wrong way to play, unless it's doing something you don't find fun, in which case there are probably 15 things within a mile of your location that you will find fun.Read our Forza Horizon 5 review.See at AmazonGroundedObsidian has had a surprisingly quick output since being acquired by Microsoft, including dabbling in some unusual projects. Grounded isn't the most off the beaten track that the studio has ventured--for that, see Pentiment below--but it's also not exactly what we would have expected from the studio most famous for games like The Outer Worlds. This is a sandbox survival game that takes place entirely in a suburban backyard, a la Honey, I Shrunk The Kids. It spent some time in early access but has since launched as a full release, challenging players to build their miniature survival camp and take on massive spiders and other threats, all while unfurling a surprisingly rich narrative.Read our Grounded review.See at AmazonHadesUnlike many roguelikes, Hades uses its structure to its narrative advantage. This starts with the protagonist Zagreus, who happens to be the god of rebirth. Played from an isometric perspective, Hades' loop sees you running through procedurally generated rooms filled with increasingly challenging enemies. The fast-paced action gameplay is an absolute joy, and it has some serious legs thanks to a plethora of different builds, including wildly different weapon play styles and abilities. Much of the storytelling is sandwiched between runs when you converse with other Greek gods and prepare for your next attempt to escape the underworld. Combining brilliant combat with top-notch writing, Hades is a must-play game even if you typically don't care for roguelikes.See on Xbox StoreHalo: The Master Chief CollectionHalo: The Master Chief Collection has been around since 2014, but Microsoft and 343 have slowly built it into a living monument to its most iconic franchise. Now not only does the MCC encompass the original three Halo games and a suite of multiplayer options that spans the entire series history, but also includes Halo 3 ODST, Halo 4, and the highly regarded Halo Reach. Altogether, it's an incredible homage to one of gaming's most storied franchises.See at AmazonHi-Fi RushAfter making its name on spooky games like Ghostwire: Tokyo and The Evil Within, Tango Gameworks surprised players with this bright and colorful rhythm-action game. Hi-Fi Rush stars Chai, a lovable loser who accidentally gets his MP3 player embedded in his chest during a cybernetic surgery, which also granted him a robotic limb. What follows is a character action game in the model of a Devil May Cry, but set to catchy tunes. The animated art style is particularly a standout, taking a cel-shaded look to a whole new level and blurring the line between cinematics and gameplay.Read our Hi-Fi Rush review.See at AmazonHitman: World of AssassinationGiven the prowess of IO Interactive's first two entries in the World of Assaassination trilogy, it's not really a surprise that Hitman 3 was an exceedingly good conclusion to Agent 47's latest arc. That said, Hitman 3 expanded on the foundation of its predecessors in some surprising ways. The game has since rebranded as "World of Assassination," encompassing the full trilogy with added features.New spins on the loop, including a delightful murder mystery level, make Hitman: World of Assassination feel fresh and inventive, too. In addition to tremendous level design and choice-driven gameplay, Hitman 3 does a better job of focusing on its story and the many lively NPCs that inhabit the sandbox-style levels. This is Hitman at its finest, though you should definitely play the entirety of the World of Assassination trilogy. You can also import the levels from Hitman and Hitman 2 and play them in one place with enhancements. The latest addition, the roguelike mode Freelancer, makes an already excellent game even better.Read our Hitman 3 review.See on AmazonIndiana Jones and the Great CircleIndiana Jones has had video game adaptations before, but MachineGames' new game is the definitive take on the famous relic hunter. The story is rich and engaging and fits right in with some of Indy's other great adventures. The character and worldbuilding help create a new original story set against the backdrop of Dr. Jones' other classic adventures. And in fitting with the character's improvisational style, the gameplay is a tightly designed clockwork of action, stealth, and immersive-sim elements. It's also available on Game Pass, so subscribers can don their stylish fedoras for free.Read our Indiana Jones and the Great Circle review.See at AmazonKingdom Come: Deliverance 2The sequel to the surprise hit 2018 Kingdom Come: Deliverance expands upon the original in just about every way. Sporting an emphasis on actually playing a role, combat and dialogue systems are layered to allow you loads of flexibility. The combat has been made more fluid with some smart streamlining, but not at the expense of the original KCD's depth. And the quests are surprising stories in their own right, broadening the scope historical epic.Read our Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 review.See on AmazonKunitsu-Gami: Path of the GoddessOne of Capcom's newest games is also its newest franchise, a demon-slaying action game that blends tower-defense elements. You'll purge demons, rescue villagers, and build traps in a setting and story inspired by Japanese folklore. It's a combination of elements that can feel almost overwhelming, but learning how to manage the various demands at once, and how the systems feed into and enhance each other, makes a package that feels special.See our Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess review.See on Xbox StoreMetaphor: ReFantazioPersona series director Katsura Hashino has returned with his first new game since 2016, and it's a fantastic one. Metaphor: ReFantazio is similar structurally to the Persona series, but it features a new original storyline set in a fantasy world, and a wide array of characters to find and classes to unlock. The turn-based RPG combat unfolds beautifully into deep layers of strategy, and the story is an affecting meditation on the power of storytelling. Metaphor: ReFantazio is one of the few games in our history to earn a 10/10 review.Read our Metaphor: ReFantazio review.See at AmazonMLB The Show 25MLB The Show 25 is the latest installment in the long-running baseball franchise, and once again it's the next-best thing to hearing the crack of the bat in-person. Road to the Show has gotten significantly improved through a revised progression system. Small but noticeable adjustments to the free agent and defensive systems help further refine what was already a solid experience. And the latest season of the Negro Leagues Storyline mode helps delve into the history of America's pasttime.Read our MLB The Show 25 review.See at AmazonMonster Hunter WildsMonster Hunter Wilds is the next evolution of the classic action-RPG series. It streamlines numerous aspects of the game to remove or mitigate some areas of friction: Things like tracking monsters, eating meals, and traversal have been streamlined to varying degrees. Some of that may not sit well with Monster Hunter veterans, but the core gameplay loop of hunting monsters, crafting better gear, and then using that gear to hunt even more dangerous monsters remains as deeply satisfying as ever. A new approach to having a somewhat seamless open world removes some of the rigidity of the best for the better. It still may not be the friendliest game to newcomers, but what awaits those willing to invest the time is an experience that remains unrivaled.See at AmazonMortal Kombat 11 UltimateAlready one of the best fighting games in recent memory, Mortal Kombat 11 is even more impressive on the powerful Xbox Series X hardware. Featuring 4K resolution and new visual flourishes, the gruesome action on screen is rendered in a ridiculous amount of detail. The base game already had an ample amount of content, including multiple single-player modes and competitive multiplayer. The Ultimate edition tosses in the Aftermath story expansion and Kombat packs including 12 additional fighters. Mortal Kombat 11 is one of those rare fighting games that balances solo and multiplayer content well, and it's also the type of fighter that's appealing to both casual players and die-hard fans alike.Read our Mortal Kombat 11 review.See on AmazonNo Man's SkyNo Man's Sky, much like Sea of Thieves, has improved mightily since launch. Over the years, developer Hello Games has released steady and substantial updates that have brought the space exploration game closer to its original, ambitious vision. No Man's Sky now features far more tangible activities, including base-building and even racing vehicles across tracks in multiplayer. No Man's Sky's next-gen update allows the game to run in 4K at 60fps. The performance enhancements also extend to lighting and shadows, which makes each of the randomly generated planets look even more detailed and alive. No Man's Sky is on Xbox Game Pass, so subscribers should absolutely check it out to see if they enjoy its loop.Read our No Man's Sky Next review.See on Xbox StoreOri and the Will of the WispsOri and the Will of the Wisps is a gorgeous platformer from Moon Studios that truly benefits from the power of the Xbox Series X. The stirring sequel runs in 4K at 120fps and supports HDR. Since Ori and the Will of the Wisps is filled with evocative, colorful settings and fast-paced platforming sequences, the boost in performance makes the already stellar experience even better. Ori and the Will of the Wisps is more of an action-platformer than its predecessor and introduces a number of new moves to employ in combat against enemies both big and small. The sprawling map is deftly designed to force you to make full use of Ori's expanded arsenal, which creates a more dynamic and satisfying adventure. If you haven't played Ori and the Blind Forest, you should play that first to get the full emotional weight of the understated but profound tale. Both games are available in the Xbox Game Pass library.Read our Ori and the Will of the Wisps review.See on Xbox StorePentimentLike Grounded, Pentiment is another example of Obsidian exploring new ground, and this adventure game certainly isn't your typical big-budget blockbuster. You play as Andreas Maler, a 16th century illuminator who becomes caught up in the mystery of a murder at an Abby. The game unfolds over the course of decades as you see how layers of history are built on top of each other, building toward a stirring conclusion. It's unlike anything you've ever played before.Read our Pentiment review.See at AmazonPrince of Persia: The Lost CrownPrince of Persia is known for being a precise and influential platformer series, but this latest entry makes it feel right at home in the metroidvania genre. The new direction fits the series like a glove, allowing Ubisoft to combine exploring a wide and varied map with series-favorite elements like precise platforming and tough combat challenges.Breaking with tradition, you don't play as the prince himself, but rather a member of his royal guard dispatched to save him from a betrayal within your ranks. The story that follows takes a few narrative shortcuts and can feel muddy, but it hints at a well-realized world full of mystery and magic. Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown is one of the best new metroidvania games in years, and will likely serve as a template for others to follow.Read our Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown review.See at Xbox StorePsychonauts 2Remarkably, Psychonauts 2 is even better than its predecessor. After suffering multiple delays, Psychonauts 2 released over the summer to critical acclaim. The return to the psychic camp for kids was long overdue, and Double Fine made the most of this sequel. It retains the humor and charming storytelling of the original while refining the platforming gameplay and upping the psychedelic nature of the levels. From a gameplay perspective, Psychonauts 2 is a huge improvement over its predecessor, both when traversing the levels and fighting baddies in combat. Where Psychonauts 2 really shines, however, is in its portrayal of its characters. Revolving around empathy and growth, Psychonauts 2 has an impactful message. It's easily one of Double Fine's best games, and you can play it on Xbox Game Pass.Read our Psychonauts 2 review.See on Xbox StoreResident Evil 4Resident Evil 4 was already considered one of the greatest action horror games of all time, and as a result it had been ported to other platforms countless times since release. After successful remakes of the previous games, expectations were set high for an RE4 remake, and Capcom delivered. This isn't just the best Resident Evil 4 has ever looked, it's also a beautifully refined take on the modern classic. It revises just enough to modernize and smooth out any rough edges while remaining utterly recognizable, and then builds new challenges on top of that to test even the most experienced players. It's a true testament to the enduring quality of Resident Evil 4.Read our Resident Evil 4 review.See at Best BuySea of ThievesSea of Thieves has come a long way since launching in 2018. Rare has turned Sea of Thieves from a somewhat shallow pirate adventure into a swashbuckling success thanks to steady updates that have drastically overhauled the experience. Most importantly, Sea of Thieves now has an abundance of content, ranging from story missions to skeleton fleet hunts and much more. With better systems and more tangible rewards at stake, the core Sea of Thieves experience is more satisfying. On the next-gen consoles, Sea of Thieves runs at a smooth 60fps in 4K on Series X and in 1080p on Series S. The reduced load times on both consoles really help limit interruptions during your voyage, too. Sea of Thieves is well-worth diving into on Xbox Series X, and it's available on Game Pass.Read our Sea of Thieves review.See on AmazonShin Megami Tensei VengeanceShin Megami Tensei V was originally released exclusively for Nintendo Switch in 2021, but its enhanced version expands to new platforms and adds a ton of new content for fans of deep narrative-focused RPGs to absorb. Vengeance adds new story details and enhancements to connect with both human and demon characters, better navigation tools for exploring the rich world, and even a number of surprises for returning players to discover.Read our Shin Megami Tensei V Vengeance review.See at AmazonSplit FictionSplit Fiction is Hazelight's first game since It Takes Two, and it carries itself with the same spirit of constant reinvention. As dual authors whose worlds get a high-tech merging, you have to navigate through smashed-up fantasy and sci-fi environments while constantly dealing with new challenges that will have you laughing alongside your co-op partner. Hazelight already gained its reputation as a premiere co-op studio and this just further cements it.Read our Split Fiction review.See at AmazonSunderfolkAiming to recapture the magic of a Friday night Dungeons & Dragons session with friends is an ambitious goal for any game, but it's one that Sunderfolk excels at. The fantasy-RPG goes all in on its DnD influences, and while it doesn't roll a Nat-20 on every one of its ideas, it still manages to translate a tabletop adventure into an enjoyable adventure on console.Read our Sunderfolk review.The Talos Principle 2The Talos Principle 2 expands and builds upon everything that made the cult debut memorable. The first-person puzzle game has you slowly peel back the layers of the world as you learn more about the web of mysteries at its heart, while also raising fascinating philosophical questions. This is a game that uses the medium to explore heady topics, and it's unlike anything else.Read our Talos Principle 2 review.See at Xbox StoreTetris Effect: ConnectedTetris Effect: Connected is magical on Xbox Series X. With 4K resolution and up to 120 fps, the particle effects that are so integral to Tetris Effect's presentation are even more detailed and stunning. Beyond the enhancements, Tetris Effect: Connected is just a delightfully inventive take on the best puzzle game ever made. It turns Tetris into an all-encompassing visual and audio experience thanks to an explosion of colors seen both in and outside the grid and the reactive tunes that will have you nodding along to the beat. In addition to an already great stable of modes, the Connected edition comes with great cooperative and competitive multiplayer modes to play locally or online. It's a relaxing experience, and one that's perfect to play for short spurts over the course of months (or even years).Read our Tetris Effect Connected review.See on Xbox StoreWarhammer 40,000 Space Marine 2Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine came out more than a decade ago, and fans of the action spectacle have been thirsting for a sequel ever since. It's finally arrived, and it's just what the Primarch ordered. The sequel adds refinements to make the combat feel more fluid than ever, as you crunch your way through hordes of Orks. It also makes excellent use of the Warhammer 40K license, building a world with a huge sense of scale while remaining approachable for those who don't know a Purgator from a Justicar.See our Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine 2 review.See on AmazonYakuza: Like a DragonYakuza: Like a Dragon released as a launch title for Xbox Series X with better performance, including options for native 4K or a solid 60fps at a slightly lower resolution, and these visual enhancements make Like a Dragon's world more vibrant and detailed. Sega has never been afraid to take risks with the quirky and moving Yakuza franchise, and Like a Dragon takes the biggest risk in franchise history by moving away from beat-'em-up combat in favor of a turn-based RPG system. The change funnels in from the personality of the new protagonist Ichiban Kasuga. Ichiban's mind often wanders, and he sees himself as a hero ripped out of Dragon Quest. This, in turn, shifts enemies into silly beings that are fought using an old-school turn-based system. Ichiban's personality is infectious, and the party-based system leads to some of the best interpersonal moments in franchise history. Yakuza: Like a Dragon may play wildly differently than previous entries in the series, but it still has all of the heart and charm that have kept fans coming back for more.Read our Yakuza: Like a Dragon review.See on AmazonTony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 is a slick trip back in time to the golden age of the skateboarding franchise. Like its predecessor, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2, you're getting a pair of beloved games that expertly combine nostalgia with modern-day upgrades, breathing new life into these classics.Read our Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 review.See at AmazonSouth of MidnightThe weakest part of South of Midnight is undoubtedly its passable gameplay, but fortunately, everything else about this Southern Gothic adventure helps to elevate the experience. With an emotional story at its core, fascinating folklore to explore, a strong art direction, and one of the best soundtracks of the year, it's a charming and atmospheric game to check out.Read our South of Midnight review.See at AmazonRematchSwitching from fists to feet, the team behind cult-classic Sifu puts its own unique spin on the beautiful game of soccer. If EA and Konami's efforts have left you jaded over the years, then you'll want to check out this arcade twist on soccer that makes you feel like you're actually on the field.Read our Rematch review.See on the Xbox Store
