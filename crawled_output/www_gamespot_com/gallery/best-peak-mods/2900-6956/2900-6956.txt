The best Peak mods expand the creative spirit of developer Team Peak. The vanilla experience is already enticing as is, inviting you and up to three other friends to cruise through biomes filled with hazards and absurd obstacles as you climb toward a volcano's summit. The community, however, has been hard at work coming up with ideas of its own.While Peak's foundation provides no shortage of thrills and can keep you busy for a while, there are multiple mods that add interesting quality-of-life updates, from features that aren't supported officially to gadgets and gimmicks that fit the in-game world.Our list provides a jack-of-all-trades collection of Peak mods to get you started. It's worth mentioning that the game has only had a few months of lifespan, and Team Peak is constantly updating it with fixes and the occasional new biome or item. But if you'd like to get a jumpstart and start expanding the game on your own with the best Peak mods available, here are our top choices gathered in one place.If you're looking for some help, we have guides about doing the scout cannon glitch, where to find the Scoutmaster, and all the items currently in the game.Share this GalleryLatest Image GalleriesHades 2 - All Keepsakes And How To Unlock ThemHades 2 - How To Unlock Animal Familiars And PetsHades 2 Arcana Guide And The Best Arcana Cards To UseGhostPingCreator: boxofbiscuits97Downloadlink: ThunderstoreGhostPing is the immediate "I didn't know how much I needed this" selection of this list. As the title teases, this makes it so you can use the pin feature when you're a ghost. While you can still use voice proximity chat by default even if you're dead, there's always that moment when you want to manually pin at an obstacle, a poisonous flower, or a specific ledge. GhostPing removes that frustration entirely.Peak UnlimitedCreator: glarmerDownloadlink: ThunderstoreOne of the best Peak mods out there, and for good reason. Peak Unlimited increases the multiplayer capacity in a lobby from the default four-player limit. Only the host needs to have this mod installed, which makes the process very easy. And in case you're wondering, yes, there will be marshmallows for the extra players when you're gathered at the campsite, and this also applies to late joiners.StableThirdPersonCameraCreator: LeftOutDownloadlink: ThunderstoreWhether you're not accustomed to first-person views due to motion sickness or you're looking for a different perspective, StableThirdPersonCamera adds a different option. All you have to do is press N, and you'll get to see your character in third person. And hey, you may have a lower chance of stepping on obstacles with this mode on.EverestCreator: StevenDownloadlink: ThunderstoreThe Peak experience tends to be self-contained within a lobby, but Everest presents an intriguing alternative. With this mod, when somebody dies, their location is saved to a server. As you play, your world is populated with skeletons of fellow fallen players, left as a mark. It's similar in nature to a Bloodstain in Dark Souls, albeit with the difference that you won't see an animation of how the player met their demise. You'll have to imagine it, and hopefully avoid recreating it.sPEAKerCreator: onlystarDownloadlink: ThunderstoreIf you're a music person, you're going to love sPEAKer. This mod adds a portable speaker that mimics its real-life counterpart to a painstaking degree. Rather than playing plain music for everyone in the background, it leverages spatial audio to make it part of the experience in an immersive way, adding to the chat proximity aspect of the game. The community has been uploading mixtapes to Thunderstore, but you can also go ahead and add your own music tracks.MorePeakCreator: smckeenDownloadlink: ThunderstoreThe daily map rotation in Peak keeps the game fresh and enticing, but you might not always want to wait 24 hours to mix things up. As part of our best Peak mods list, MorePeak removes the daily wait timer entirely. Instead, every time you start a round, the game will load a new map. It could be a good method to keep in mind if you're trying to find the secret entrance in the Mesa biome.MultiplayerPauseCreator: CodeBurstDownloadlink: ThunderstoreHere's a Peak mod that every multiplayer lobby host should have. MultiplayerPause does what it says on the tin, allowing the host to pause the game for everyone by merely pressing "P" on the keyboard. It's perfect for quick breaks, especially as the fog can start to rise quite fast depending on the difficulty.PiggybackCreator: RooseDownloadlink: ThunderstorePiggyback is similar to MultiplayerPause, but it's not as disruptive. Basically, if one player has gone AFK or if they simply want a shortcut, this mod allows players to carry other characters even if they've not passed out. Only the players who intend to carry others need to have the mod installed, so it can happen by surprise if conditions are met.BetterRagdollCreator: LuluberluDownloadlink: ThunderstoreRagdoll is an important aspect of Peak, but the BetterRagdoll mod allows you to manually trigger it with just the press of a button (X on the keyboard). This makes it so you get a little push in the direction that you're moving, making it feel more dynamic, while also speeding up the process of getting back up.PeakClassModCreator: SafronDownloadlink: ThunderstoreAs part of our selection of best Peak mods, this selection is a substantial addition, getting close to an overhaul of how the multiplayer experience works. PeakClassMod introduces eight classes with distinct abilities and playstyles, as well as disadvantages to balance them out. The classes include Scout, Medic, Tech-Priest, Mushroomancer, Great Épée, Rogue, Eddie, and Bill. It's definitely not a mod that takes itself seriously, which is fitting for Peak. If you've already accrued dozens of hours in the game and you've been wanting to try something new with your usual multiplayer group, this is the Peak mod for you.
