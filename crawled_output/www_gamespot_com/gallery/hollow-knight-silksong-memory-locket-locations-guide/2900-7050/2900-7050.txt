Are you eager to find all Memory Lockets in Hollow Knight: Silksong? These materials remain useful throughout your journey. When used, they actually allow you to unlock additional slots for your tools and utility items. Our guide has all the details that you need, but we'd like to warn you ahead of time that there are a few spoilers regarding endgame content.Where to find all Memory Lockets in Hollow Knight: SilksongThere are 20 Memory Lockets in the game. They're directly tied to the Crest feature given their use and functionality:You can learn about your equipment in our Crest locations guide.Each Crest has a limited number of slots that allow you to equip tools--i.e. red for offense, blue for support, and yellow for utility.However, Memory Slots unlock additional slots, so you'll be able to equip more items for your build or loadout.Note that our guide is organized based on each region in Pharloom. We've also included separate maps for a select few zones that have multiple Memory Lockets. Lastly, we suggest acquiring abilities like the Clawline grappling hook and Faydown Cloak double jump to make exploration and navigation a breeze.Share this GalleryLatest Image GalleriesWhere To Find All Tools In Hollow Knight: SilksongGames Like Diablo To Loot Your Way Through In 2025All The Nintendo Switch 2 Games (Confirmed And Rumored) So FarMemory Locket #1: Bone BottomThis is one of the first few Hollow Knight: Silksong Memory Lockets that you can find while exploring. To get it, start the Volatile Flintbeetles wish from the board in Bone Bottom. Then, defeat the Flintbeetles in The Marrow. Turn in the quest to receive your reward.Memory Locket #2: The MarrowThis Memory Locket is directly to the right of the top-middle bench in The Marrow. Use the wall climb ability that you obtained after beating the Shellwood boss to claim your prize.Memory Locket #3: Hunter's MarchFrom The Marrow, keep going to the right and use your pogo maneuver on the red flowers to reach Hunter's March. The Memory Locket is in the lower-right corner of this zone just past a bunch of red flowers and red spikes. Destroy the bone cage and pick up the item from the corpse.Memory Locket #4: Deep DocksThis particular Memory Locket in Hollow Knight: Silksong is actually at the bottommost section of Deep Docks--i.e. it's to the left of the large chamber with the diving bell. When you're at the narrow shaft, you'll notice a breakable wall. It leads to a chasm with searing hot spikes on the walls. Float down safely to claim your reward.Note: We only discovered this area during Act 3 of the campaign. We're unable to confirm if you can reach this place earlier, such as by following a roundabout loop from the Simple Key doorway.Far Fields map: Memory Locket locationsThe map above shows the locations of two Memory Lockets in the Far Fields region. Note that Memory Locket B can only be acquired much later in the campaign.Memory Locket #5: Far Fields ASold by a vendor named Mort for 150x Rosaries. Note that you have to spend 30x Rosaries just to open the door to Mort's shop. That said, you can destroy the mechanism above the door once you're inside the shop. This keeps the place open in case you need to revisit it later.Memory Locket #6: Far Fields BYou can only reach this particular location in Far Fields during Act 3. Specifically, it's when you obtain the Elegy of the Deep power as part of The Old Hearts main quest.From Hunter's March, use your Silksoar super jump in the room with the rabbit statue.Head to the secret passageway through Far Fields until you reach the very top.The doorway leads to a battle against Skarrsinger Karmelita, who drops an item for the main quest.But if you keep going to the right of the doorway, you can pass through a hidden opening. In the next area, you have to defeat a Skarrgard elite that's been corrupted by the darkness. Eliminate this foe to pick up your reward.Greymoor map: Memory Locket locationsThere are two additional Hollow Knight: Silksong Memory Lockets in the region of Greymoor. Both are actually in fairly easy to reach areas.Memory Locket #7: Greymoor AMake your way to the Halfway Home. Then, double-jump and mantle up the small cubbyhole to the left of the innkeeper.Memory Locket #8: Greymoor BWhile you're in the Bellway fast travel area, destroy the breakable wall to the left of the Bell Beast to reveal a hidden passageway. It leads to the dank cellars filled with nasty bugs and rats.Memory Locket #9: Bellhart shopMake sure you defeat the Widow boss to lift the curse that plagues the citizens of Bellhart. The shopkeeper, Frey, will then sell this Memory Locket for 330x Rosaries.Memory Locket #10: Bellhart ceilingReturn to Bellhart during Act 3 after you've unlocked the Silksoar super jump ability. Climb up the ledges in the central area, then use your Silksoar to reach the small nook above.Memory Locket #11: WormwaysThis Memory Locket can be found in the lower-left portion of the Wormways. You can access this location after getting past the Shellwood region. Alternatively, you can go to this place a lot earlier in the campaign if you use a Simple Key.Note that there's a blue bud near this area. It's a requirement for the Alchemist's Assistant quest in the Wormways.Memory Locket #12: Blasted StepsYou need to be very careful when grabbing this Memory Locket in Hollow Knight: Silksong. It's at the central section of the Blasted Steps, which is teeming with sand worms in most rooms. At the central section--i.e. before the main shaft--you'll notice ledges down below if you slide down the walls. One of the ledges has your prize.Memory Locket #13: Sands of KarakSince you're already in Blasted Steps, you might as well travel to Sands of Karak, which has even more frustrating platforming sections. The item is in the left-hand side of the zone.The idea is to cross the spike-filled floor via the disappearing tree branches. When you're at the opposite side, you have to circle back around by using the other tree branches. Doing so lets you reach a nook in the upper-left corner.Underworks map: Memory Locket locationsWe've got a map of the Underworks that shows the locations of two more Memory Lockets. You definitely need the Faydown Cloak double jump for these areas.Memory Locket #14: Underworks ACheck the upper portion of the room with the three benches that cost Rosaries. There's a hidden passageway through the ceiling. If you keep going left, you'll find a glowing item on the floor.Memory Locket #15: Underworks BTrying to get this Hollow Knight: Silksong Memory Locket can be an unbelievable ordeal:Assuming you haven't unlocked various shortcuts yet, then you have to go through the Whiteward sub-zone to reach the central portion of the Underworks.From the tall vertical shaft, float down and get across the spike walls and floors.You'll be able to circle back to the top of the shaft.The Memory Locket is at the end of the tunnel to the left. If you go back down, you'll unlock a shortcut to the Grand Bellway.Memory Locket #16: MemoriumWhile exploring Memorium, you'll notice that the zone is divided into six horizontal corridors layered on top of each other. The Memory Locket at the left-hand side of the third corridor from the bottom. You have to avoid plants with elongating necks, as well as thorny vines that line the walls.Memory Locket #17: Whispering VaultsHere's what you need to do to obtain the Memory Locket in the Whispering Vaults:Go to the lower-right section of the zone--i.e. below the Vaultkeeper NPC for the Threefold Melody quest.Use the large crates to reach the top-right corner of the chamber.There's actually a hidden passageway that leads to an area with cogs and traps.Keep going up and bash through the wall to reach a small nook.Bilewater map: Memory Locket locationsThe Bilewater map above shows a couple of Memory Lockets in Hollow Knight: Silksong. Note that Bilewater is one of the worst areas in the game due to environmental hazards and deadly enemies. Traversing this area is definitely not for the faint of heart.Memory Locket #18: Bilewater AThe aforementioned Memory Locket in Whispering Vaults is actually in a secret area that leads to an alternate path to Bilewater. If you float down the spiked chasm all the way to the exit, you'll arrive at the lower-left corner of Bilewater, which happens to have the Twisted Bud unique item.The small nook that has Bilewater Memory Locket A is fairly close to this location, too. As usual, watch out for spikes, exploding pogo balloons, and maggot-infested waters.Memory Locket #19: Bilewater BThe second Memory Locket is in the middle-right section of Bilewater. You have to go through a corridor with floating critters, which then takes you to a small room with a bench. The spot just before the bench has corpses placed in hanging sacks. Destroy the sacks and pick up your reward.Memory Locket #20: The SlabYou can find one more Memory Locket in The Slab. Specifically, it's in the small room that's above and to the right of the area with the bench and fast travel point. It's also the same room with the board with lore fragments that you can read.In any case, the darkened ceiling above you actually hides a secret passageway. Use your Silksoar super jump, then enter the small cave.That does it for our guide on where to find all Memory Lockets in Hollow Knight: Silksong. Don't forget that these are all used to unlock more slots for your Crests. Moreover, you might be interested in several unlockable bonuses from Eva, which are all dependent on how many Memory Slots you've gathered so far.Play as Hornet and brave the dangers of the Kingdom of Pharloom.
