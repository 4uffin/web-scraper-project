Are you baffled by all the locations of Mister Mushroom in Hollow Knight: Silksong? This NPC, also known as the herald, first appeared in the previous game. Now, he's back in the sequel as part of the Passing of the Age quest. You're going to have to solve a riddle to figure out his whereabouts. Our guide has all the details, but be forewarned that there are a few spoilers ahead.Where to find Mister Mushroom in Hollow Knight: Silksong - Passing of the Age ending guideSimilar to the previous game, the Mister Mushroom and the Passing of the Age quest actually leads to a secret ending. That said, all the steps here can only be done during Act 3 of the campaign. You unlock that by completing a rather convoluted wish called Silk and Soul.Then, during Act 3, you must progress further until you acquire the Silksoar ability--i.e. super jump--from The Abyss region. This is what you need to gain access to the riddle pillar.Share this GalleryLatest Image GalleriesHades 2 - All Keepsakes And How To Unlock ThemHades 2 - How To Unlock Animal Familiars And PetsHades 2 Arcana Guide And The Best Arcana Cards To UseHow to start the Passing of the Age questThe Hollow Knight: Silksong Passing of the Age quest comes from a riddle altar in Putrefied Docks. It's at the lower-right corner of the zone just past Fleatopia--i.e. the location of the Flea Caravan after you've rescued at least 25 Lost Fleas.Climb onto the ledge and look above you. Then, use your Silksoar maneuver to reach the hidden nook. The riddle has the following clues:Under chapel fallen to the monarch's might,Over camp collapsed to the black thread plight,Scorched field on edge, shells black and burned,Up towers spinning, near the surgeon spurned,Cage of one who raged against the silken lie,Fell heart of frost who soars on high,Past cradle's peak, last test of fitness,That the age may pass, this shroom its witness.Note: The specific locations that you visit should have blue mushrooms on the ground. Stand near these and play your Needolin to make Mister Mushroom appear. Talk to him, then make your way to the next area in the sequence.Mister Mushroom location #1: MosshomeThe first place you'll find Mister Mushroom in Hollow Knight: Silksong is in Mosshome, the initial sub-zone. The patch with blue mushrooms is just to the right of the chapel entrance--i.e. where you met the Snail Shamans.Mister Mushroom location #2: Bone BottomFrom Mosshome, go back to the top and walk over to Bone Bottom to the right. The correct spot is on a ledge above the ruined camp that used to be a bustling settlement during the game's previous chapters.Mister Mushroom location #3: Far FieldsThe Hollow Knight: Silksong Mister Mushroom location in the Far Fields is all the way at the bottom-right portion of the region. It's fairly close to the entrance to Weavenest Cindril. Just jump on the ledge past the enemies to see the shroom plot.Mister Mushroom location #4: GreymoorThe clue for this Hollow Knight: Silksong Mister Mushroom location pertains to the exiled surgeon, Yarnaby. Yes, the same fella from the Twisted Bud/Infestation Operation quest.In any case, make your way to the top-left section of Greymoor by pogoing and double-jumping to avoid the spikes. The ceiling has a pathway that leads to Wisp Thicket. The patch of ground with the mushrooms is off to the side.Mister Mushroom location #5: The SlabThe clue on the Passing of the Age riddle refers to the First Sinner boss in The Slab. To reach its lair, you must obtain the Key of Apostate from Bilewater. Then, unlock the door just above the bench/fast travel point, and drop down to the chamber with the locked prison.Mister Mushroom location #6: Mount FayRemember the long and arduous trek that you had to make just to obtain the Faydown Cloak double jump? Well, you need to do it all over again. That's because Mister Mushroom is at the very peak of the mountain right next to the mythical bird.Mister Mushroom location #7: The CradleThe seventh and final spot where Mister Mushroom awaits is all the way up in the Cradle--i.e. where you fought Grandmother Silk:There's a slightly well-hidden passageway on the ceiling of the corridor to the right of Cogwork Core.You'll need to use your Silksoar ability often throughout this segment.Upon reaching the Cradle, bind the severed arm of Grandmother Silk to receive the Pale Nails skill. This should be the last silk skill/ability in the game. There's also a narrow opening along the right-hand side, so just use Silksoar to super jump to the top.The platforming section beyond that requires lots of double-jumping, pogoing, and grappling.Mister Mushroom is on a ledge in an area without a map. Talk to him and he'll zoom away.You can follow him to the surface, but you won't find him there. Instead, you should just go all the way to the right to come across the Nameless Town. Play your Needolin at the ruined house at the far-right edge to receive a Surface Memento. It's used in your personal home in Bellhart.These are the Hollow Knight: Silksong Mister Mushroom locations that we've discovered. Past this point, you just need to defeat the final boss of Act 3. In any case, you can take a look at our endings guide if you're curious about the other campaign conclusions.Play as Hornet and brave the dangers of the Kingdom of Pharloom.
