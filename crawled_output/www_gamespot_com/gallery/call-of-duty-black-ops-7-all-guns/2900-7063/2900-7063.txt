While we don't know the exact names of a small handful of the weapons in Black Ops 7 just yet, thanks to a new gameplay trailer and accompanying blog post, we can now provide the specifics around the guns and other weapons available in the new Call of Duty game. There's also a new feature coming to Loadouts--Overclocking--that allows you to supercharge your gear and unlock certain enhancements during matches, including faster Field Upgrades, reduced Scorestreak costs, and more dangerous equipment.Tactical gear can disorient, disable, heal, or reveal foes or friends, and Lethal gear will deal huge damage via explosives, drones, and other deployables. Overclocking these items can improve things including blast radius, stun strength, and more.Field upgrades will adjust the flow of battle by supplying ammo, launching drones, hiding players, or deploying holographic decoys to distract the opposition.Wildcards are back in Black Ops 7--selectable perks that can grant extra attachments, more equipment, or replace Scorestreaks entirely. The perks you choose define your specialty during combat from three categories--Enforcer, Recon, or Strategist. Black Ops 7 will introduce hybrid versions of these specialties, meaning you can mix categories and still be rewarded with bonuses.You'll get a chance to get hands-on with these guns and weapons across a variety of Black Ops 7 maps during the Black Ops 7 beta that starts on October 2.Share this GalleryLatest Image GalleriesSee 40+ Images Of Kojima's Terrifying New Xbox Game, ODBest Lethal Company Mods To Enjoy With The Group Chat In 2025Best Fallout: New Vegas Mods To Download In 2025LoadoutsLoadouts have a brand-new look, and the new Overclock system. You can choose how to Overclock your loadout, whether you focus on Equipment, Field Upgrades, or your Scorestreak. Loadouts will affect the guns and abilities you have during matches, and you can customize and save up to 10 in Black Ops 7. You're still able to adjust your loadout during matches, meaning you can tweak it in real-time to see the effects.Tactical and Lethal equipment, Field Upgrades, and Scorestreaks can all be overclocked. You can unlock up to two Overclock abilities over time that will provide benefits including a lower score requirement to trigger Scorestreaks, decreased charge time for Field Upgrades, and extra lethality for Equipment.The Loadout menu has the following selectable options:Primary weaponSecondary weaponMelee weaponTacticalLethalField UpgradePerksCombat SpecialtyWildcardOverclocksPrimary WeaponsPrimary weapons are the main weapon you'll use during combat in Black Ops 7. By creating a build for a weapon you can generate a code to share your exact weapon with friends. While we don't yet know all of the exact weapons coming to each category, from the various Black Ops 7 trailers we've seen there will be some familiar names and some new ones. The following slides show some confirmed weapons coming to the Black Ops 7 beta.The weapon types you can equip as your Primary include:Assault riflesSMGsShotgunsLMGsMarksman RiflesSniper RiflesM15 Mod 0An adaptable full auto Assault Rifle combining well-rounded damage, range, and handling for a weapon that performs admirably across a variety of combat scenarios.MXR-17A full auto Assault Rifle with excellent accuracy and range, offset by its more modest mobility and rate of fire.Peacekeeper Mk1Full auto Assault Rifle delivering exceptional mobility and handling for its class, but at the cost of high recoil and limited range.Graz 45kA versatile full auto SMG offering a solid balance of CQB power, handling, and recoil.Razor 9mmFull auto SMG with an extreme rate of fire, but limited range and slower handling.Dravec 45A full auto SMG thatâ€™s highly stable and effective at longer ranges, but with less raw CQB power.M10 BreacherA pump action charge Shotgun.

Swapping weapons is faster than reloading, and with certain Perks you can adjust your loadout to equip a primary weapon in both slots. However, as standard, there is a limited amount of weapons available to equip in your secondary slot, usually only including pistols and launchers. Jager 45Semi-auto Pistol. A reliable sidearm with a very fast rate of fire and low recoil.CODA 9Full auto Pistol with high damage and rate of fire offset by strong recoil and a shorter effective range.A.R.C.

Deals high damage to vehicles and Scorestreaks.Melee WeaponsMelee weapons are what you'll rely on in close combat when you're low on ammo elsewhere, or just want to be a bit more hands-on with your attacks. In previous Call of Duty games you've been able to equip anything from hammers to boxing gloves for these encounters, but in Black Ops 7 there are new offerings. If you preorder the Vault Edition, you'll get the Flatline Mk 2 melee weapon, shown above. During the developer direct trailer, an operator is seen slicing the head off a zombie using a katana, which could mean it will be equippable in other multiplayer modes, too. The riot shield is confirmed to be making a return, too.Flatline Mk.
