Settle it in the streetsWhen it comes to picking the best fighting games, there's no shortage of options--the genre has been one of the industry's most consistent since the early 1990s. Names like Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat, and Tekken have grown into some of the biggest series in the entire industry, let alone just fighting games, and they continue to get better through additional downloadable characters--some hailing from outside of the fighting game scene. At the moment, fighters are in the midst of another renaissance era.As such, it might be intimidating to pick out a fighting game to play. Below, we run through our picks for some of the best fighting games you can play right now, whether you're on PS5, Xbox, Switch, or PC. Every game listed here can be purchased and downloaded right to your machine without needing to dig up any old hardware, and you'll be able to get into the fight whenever you like. From pure 1v1 fighters to chaotic platform battlers, from all-time classics to modern melees, these are the best of the best in fighting games in 2025.Share this GalleryLatest Image GalleriesSee 40+ Images Of Kojima's Terrifying New Xbox Game, ODBest Lethal Company Mods To Enjoy With The Group Chat In 2025Best Fallout: New Vegas Mods To Download In 2025Street Fighter 6Platforms: PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PCDeveloper: CapcomRelease Date: June 2, 2023Street Fighter has routinely blazed a trail of success for fighting games as a whole, starting with Street Fighter II in 1991. Street Fighter 6 is no different; the vast improvements over its predecessor, coupled with an ever-growing roster and a robust online offering, have made SF6 one of the top fighting games on the market today. SF6's trajectory continues to trend upward, as it recently added Terry Bogard and Mai Shiranui--the first guest characters in franchise history--to the roster, and the second season of DLC will soon end with the Capoeira master Elena.See on Best BuyTekken 8Platforms: PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PCDeveloper: Bandai NamcoRelease Date: January 25, 2024The latest in Bandai Namco's illustrious fighting franchise, Tekken 8 has stormed out of the gate in its first year. The Heat system offers a new level of offensive capabilities, the roster is packed with iconic characters from across the franchise, and the story mode is a wild ride following the struggle between Kazuya and his son, Jin. Plus, a full suite of customization options will let you transform your favorite character how you see fit, which adds a personal touch to the action. The first season of downloadable content added Heihachi Mishima, Lidia, Eddy Gordo, and guest character Clive from Final Fantasy XVI, and Season 2 has just kicked off with franchise veteran Anna Williams.See on Best BuyMortal Kombat 1Platforms: PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, PCDeveloper: NetherRealm StudiosRelease Date: September 19, 2023NetherRealm Studios's gloriously gory fighting franchise has reset the stage in Mortal Kombat 1, with a new era bringing big changes to established faces. The combat is still fast and furious, however, and the series's trademark Fatalities will both delight and disgust. Throw in guest characters like Homelander, Peacemaker, and Omni-Man, in-depth single-player modes, and more, and you have one bloody good time. Kombat Pack 2 kept the guest character train rolling with Ghostface, Conan the Barbarian, and T-1000, but rumors suggest that may be the end of the road for MK1.See on Best BuyGuilty Gear StrivePlatforms: PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PCDeveloper: Arc System WorksRelease Date: June 11, 2021The anime subgenre of fighting games has built a reputation of precise, skill-based action, and the name Guilty Gear has been at the forefront of the conversation. Guilty Gear Strive has plenty of it to offer too, both through its multi-tiered online system and a roster with three seasons (and counting) of new additions under its belt--Season 4 began late last year with Dizzy, while Venom entered the fray in March. Strive is one of the more tenured games on this list, but it's only getting better with age.See on AmazonFatal Fury: City of the WolvesPlatforms: Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, PCDeveloper: SNKRelease Date: April 24, 202526 years after the last Fatal Fury game launched, SNK's flagship fighting franchise made its triumphant return to the consoles in April, with a new comic-inspired style and a roster of new, returning, and outright strange guest characters in tow. Its REV System is a novel take on current fighting game tropes, with certain moves and techniques filling a meter that risks powering you down if you overuse them, and each character boasts a "easy to use, hard to master" moveset for those looking for a challenge.Plus, Swedish DJ Salvatore Ganacci, as weird as it is to see him on the main roster, is a delightfully silly addition who somehow fits right in. The other guest character, howeverâ€¦ that's another story.Granblue Fantasy Versus RisingPlatforms: PS5, PS4, PCDeveloper: Arc System Works, CyGamesRelease Date: December 11, 2023Granblue Fantasy Versus Rising is a sequel to Granblue Fantasy Versus--CyGames and Arc System Works's first attempt at bringing the world-renowned mobile RPG series to fighting games in 2020. The new entry brought major improvements, including an all-new online system featuring rollback netcode, redesigned fighting mechanics, and an expanded roster--including 2B from Nier: Automata as DLC. Pair all of this with a striking visual style, and Granblue Fantasy Versus Rising offers plenty for fighting fans to enjoy.See on SteamMarvel Vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade ClassicsPlatforms: PS4, Nintendo Switch, PC (coming to Xbox in 2025)Developer: CapcomRelease Date: September 12, 2024 (digital); November 22, 2024 (physical)The late '90s and early 2000s were dominated by Capcom's Vs. Series, with Marvel Vs. Capcom and its ilk leading the charge. The games were thought lost to time, but the two companies have finally rereleased them in a single collection, with rollback netcode, a music jukebox, and an art gallery to boot. Marvel Vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics gives fighting fans something they've been requesting for over a decade, and it was worth the wait.See at AmazonKiller Instinct: Anniversary EditionPlatforms: Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PCDeveloper: Microsoft Studios, Iron Galaxy StudiosRelease Date: November 23, 2023 (original launch November 22, 2013)11 years ago, Killer Instinct re-emerged as an Xbox One launch title, and it became the first free-to-play fighting game on the market. Since then, it's grown to be a cult classic, with a flashy combo-based fighting system and characters from Halo, Gears Of War, and Battletoads alongside the KI originals. The recently released Anniversary Edition offers the full game, all of its DLC, and a new balance patch all in one package, and is the perfect way to experience KI right now. And if you subscribe to Game Pass, you can play it for free.See on SteamSuper Smash Bros. UltimatePlatforms: Nintendo SwitchDeveloper: NintendoRelease Date: December 7, 2018Everyone is here! Super Smash Bros. Ultimate takes the platform-fighting format the Smash Bros. series popularized and cranks it up to 11, with a roster bursting at the seams with fighters and over 100 stages (or even more, counting the modified versions) to fight in. Nintendo stalwarts like Mario, Link, and Pikachu can do battle with the likes of Steve from Minecraft, Banjo-Kazooie, Cloud and Sephiroth from Final Fantasy VII, and Sora from Kingdom Hearts. Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is video-game history in a box, one of the best Switch games, and a must-own for fighting fans and Switch owners alike.See on Best BuyThe King of Fighters XVPlatforms: PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PCDeveloper: SNKRelease Date: February 14, 2022The King of Fighters has offered SNK fans hard-hitting three-on-three action since the first game in 1996, and KOF XV is no exception. Mixing and matching your favorite fighters, then choosing the order in which they'll fight, adds an extra layer of strategy that other fighting games simply don't have. KOF XV is a great choice for those who like that extra challenge every time they enter a match.See on AmazonUltimate Marvel Vs. Capcom 3Platforms: PS4, Xbox One, PCDeveloper: CapcomRelease Date: November 15, 2011Ultimate Marvel Vs. Capcom 3 is the top game in the storied history of Marvel and Capcom crossovers--sorry MvC Infinite--and it's still a blast to play despite being 12 years old. While UMvC3 is also a three-on-three team fighter like KOF XV, that's where the similarities end, as all three characters can be switched in and out at will to create absolute havoc on the screen, and it's always a delight. While the aforementioned Marvel Vs. Capcom Collection is also an option, UMvC3 is a chance to see where the series stands now.See on SteamSNK Vs. Capcom: SVC ChaosPlatforms: PS4, Nintendo Switch, PCDeveloper: SNKRelease Date: July 22, 2024 (original launch July 24, 2003)Evo 2024 saw the return of SNK Vs. Capcom: SVC Chaos, a weird-but-wonderful entry in the pantheon of Capcom and SNK crossover fighters. SVC Chaos was developed by SNK, so while the character roster is split between the two companies, the fighting mechanics and visual style are all SNK. While it hasn't resonated as much with players as the Capcom Vs. SNK games, the recent SVC Chaos re-release is a neat time capsule of a bygone era of fighting games.See on SteamSoul Calibur VIPlatforms: PS4, Xbox One, PCDeveloper: Bandai NamcoRelease Date: October 19, 2018While Tekken has ruled the roost in Bandai Namco's fighting division as of late, Soul Calibur has flown under the radar despite producing one of the best fighters currently available. Soul Calibur VI features crisp weapon-based 3D fighting, with an iconic cast of characters including guests like Geralt from The Witcher and 2B from Nier: Automata--her second appearance on this list. We don't know if a new Soul Calibur game will ever come, but for now Soul Calibur VI more than gets the job done.See on Best BuyUnder Night In-Birth II Sys:CelesPlatforms: PS4, PS5, Nintendo Switch, PCDeveloper: French-Bread, Arc System WorksRelease Date: January 25, 2024Speaking of under the radar, Under Night In-Birth surprised a lot of people when the first game hit arcades in 2012. After a few revisions, the sequel Under Night In-Birth II Sys:Celes finally released earlier this year, and it's become one of the top anime fighters on the market. The precise, skill-based fighting gameplay we mentioned before is on full display here, and the Grind system's push-and-pull mechanic makes each round a nail biter to the end. If you like fighting games at all, Under Night should be on your radar.See on Best BuyCapcom Fighting CollectionPlatforms: PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, PCDeveloper: CapcomRelease Date: June 24, 2022Capcom Fighting Collection is 10 fighting games in one package, which already means you're getting a big bang for your buck. However, considering how rare some of these games were before they hit this collection--Vampire Savior II and Red Earth chief among them--this collection may be the only way you can play them officially. This fighting collection acts as a terrific time capsule to the past, and each game is worth the walk down memory lane.See on AmazonDNF DuelPlatforms: PS4, PS5, Nintendo Switch, PCDeveloper: Eighting, Neople, Arc System WorksRelease Date: June 28, 2022DNF Duel and Granblue Fantasy Versus Rising have a lot in common; they both adapted long-tenured RPGs to the fighting game scene, and both were developed by Arc System Works, developers of Guilty Gear Strive. As with Granblue, DNF Duel does a great job of adapting the classes of Dungeon Fighter into individual characters via a fighting system that's easy to pick up. It also tells an original story in the DNF universe, which gives tenured Dungeon Fighter fans a reason to try this new take.See on SteamSamurai Shodown (2019)Platforms: PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, PC, Mobile (via Netflix)Developer: SNKRelease Date: June 25, 2019SNK fell out of fighting game development for a little while in the 2010s--save for a few King of Fighters entries--and Samurai Shodown marked its full-time return in 2019. The gamble paid off, as Samurai Shodown's tense and hard-hitting battles felt right at home with the rest of the fighting game offerings at the time. The bar was set for SNK, and now with Fatal Fury set to return in 2025, the company can thank Samurai Shodown for setting the foundation.See on AmazonMelty Blood: Type LuminaPlatforms: PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PCDeveloper: French-Bread, Type-MoonRelease Date: September 30, 2021Along with Guilty Gear, Melty Blood is one of the longest-running anime fighting franchises ever made. Type Lumina, which launched in 2021, marked a worthy entry in that lineage, with the Rapid Beat auto-combo system and New Moon System mechanic offering a new way to experience the Melty Blood style of gameplay. Make sure to give Melty Blood a try, as we're sure you'll agree it's a worthy member of the current fighting game landscape.See on SteamSoulcalibur IIPlatforms: Nintendo Switch 2 (via Nintendo Switch Online GameCube Classics)Developer: Bandai NamcoRelease Date: August 26, 2003 (GameCube), June 5, 2025 (NSO)Pretty strange to see a fighting game from 2003 sitting on this list, right? Well, thanks to the recent launch of the Nintendo Switch 2 and its access to classic GameCube games, we once again have easy access to this gem. Soulcalibur II built on its amazing predecessor with an expanded roster, robust single-player offerings, and the addition of console-exclusive guest characters--with the GameCube's character being none other than Link from The Legend of Zelda.The Nintendo Switch Online version of SCII adds online multiplayer to the mix as well, so you can continue the tale of souls and swords, eternally retold, with your friends online. Though, for the authentic 2003 experience, we suggest playing SCII multiplayer locally with your friends, ideally with Doritos 3Ds and bottles of Pepsi Blue in close proximity.Skullgirls: 2nd EncorePlatforms: PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, PCDeveloper: Hidden Variable StudiosRelease Date: July 7, 2015Skullgirls 2nd Encore is somehow still going strong in 2024, despite a tumultuous life cycle with multiple developers and publishers causing delays in support and extra content. Now though, the unique team-based fighter has a dedicated circle of fans, thanks to its solid fighting mechanics and fantastic character designs. Skullgirls may be on its 2nd Encore, but we wouldn't be surprised if a third is around the corner, so get in now.See on SteamBlazBlue Cross Tag BattlePlatforms: PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, PCDeveloper: Arc System WorksRelease Date: May 31, 2018BlazBlue is what happens when a bunch of anime-fighting-game developers put their games into a blender and make a two-on-two team-based fighting smoothie. BlazBlue, Persona 4 Arena, Arcana Heart, Melty Blood, and Under Night In-Birth are but a handful of the franchises on offer here--along with multiple characters from Rooster Teeth's anime RWBY making their fighting game debut. BlazBlue Cross Tag battle is a wild idea made into a wild fighting game, but every match is a ton of fun.See on AmazonBrawlhallaPlatforms: PS4, Xbox One, PC, Nintendo Switch, Android, iOSDeveloper: Blue Mammoth GamesRelease Date: April 30, 2014Brawlhalla is a fighting game with a rollercoaster history, but it has settled nicely within its niche in the genre in 2025. While its animated graphics and goofy-looking characters might make it seem like a simple game at first, Brawlhalla features an extremely high skill ceiling in terms of its mechanics and combos. With over 50 characters currently in the game, you'll have to spend hundreds of hours to master every one. Brawlhalla features several different modes to play, including a 2v2 Ranked playlist and several casual playlists that can be played with up to eight players at once. It's a fantastic fighting game if you can get past the steep learning curve the community bestows upon you immediately.See on SteamFeatured in this ImageBrawlhalla%gameName%Get the latest news and videos for this game daily, no spam, no fuss.

You're Good to Go!We'll begin emailing you updates about %gameName%.FollowDragon Ball FighterZPlatforms: PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PC, Nintendo SwitchDeveloper: Arc System WorksRelease Date: January 13, 2018Dragon Ball FighterZ has been one of the most consistently well-rated fighting games since its initial release in 2018. Utilizing one of the most famous anime properties in the world, the game is action-packed with all of the recognizable characters from the Dragon Ball franchise. You'll also see the same anime graphics mixed with gameplay that's easy enough to pick up on, but extremely difficult to master. One of the more stand-out elements of the game is the 3v3 tag team mechanic. This allows you to craft a team of three fighters and use them interchangeably throughout the fight, adding a layer of strategy that's not present in other fighting games. Different teams allow for different combos, but you have to make sure your team matches up well against your opponent. You can play a Ranked playlist as well as unranked playlists, including a six-player party mode. Dragon Ball FighterZ has remained a top fighting game for years, and it's still one of the best in 2025.See on FanaticalFeatured in this ImageDragon Ball FighterZ%gameName%Get the latest news and videos for this game daily, no spam, no fuss.
