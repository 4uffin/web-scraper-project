Are you eager to find all Mask Shards in Hollow Knight: Silksong? These items are very important as they're related to your survivability. They actually increase your maximum health so you can survive extra hits in combat or while exploring.All Mask Shards in Hollow Knight: Silksong - How to increase your maximum healthMask Shards are scattered in various regions of Pharloom. You need four of these to gain one additional health pip/icon. That might not seem much, but every upgrade matters, especially once you reach some challenging late-game stages. In any case, we've organized our guide based on when we acquired these items.Note 1: If you want to upgrade Hornet's silk energy, then you need items known as Spool Fragments.Note 2: Some locations are very hard to reach. You might want to unlock abilities like the Clawline grapple and Faydown Cloak double jump.Share this GalleryLatest Image GalleriesHow To Unlock All Endings In Hollow Knight: SilksongWhere To Find All Pale Oil Weapon Upgrades In Hollow Knight: SilksongThe Biggest Game Releases Of September 2025Mask Shard #1: Bone BottomThis will likely be the first Hollow Knight: Silksong Mask Shard that you see in the campaign. It's being sold by a vendor in Bone Bottom for 300 Rosaries. Just farm some enemies and wallop objects with beads until you've amassed enough of this currency.Mask Shard #2: Mosshome/Wormways (Part 1)This Mask Shard is located in the Wormways zone. To reach it, you have to take the upper-left exit in Mosshome just past the shrine. Once there, you'll see a large chasm that you need to cross. Note that there's also an elevator below that takes you back and forth this spot and the Bone Bottom settlement.If you really want to grab this item early in the campaign, then you must use the pogo maneuver to hop on top of the flying enemies in the chasm.Alternatively, you can progress a bit further until you acquire the Swift Step ability--i.e. dash/air dash.Mask Shard #2: Mosshome/Wormways (Part 2)The next area has a giant bettle miniboss that spits acid from the ceiling. You can avoid the corrosive liquid by running underneath it and using the platforms as cover.Just past that, you'll notice a locked door that can be opened with a Simple Key. Below it is a nook with a destructible wall. Smash it with your weapon to reveal a Mask Shard.Mask Shard #3: Far FieldsThis Hollow Knight: Silksong Mask Shard can be found in Far Fields. You need to obtain the Drifter's Cloak from the Seamstress by giving her Spine Cores. This grants Hornet the ability to float in mid-air and use wind currents.From the Seamstress' hut, float to the very top of the room by destroying the explosive magma ledges to create more wind currents. Take the top-left exit and, as you reach the corner, you'll spot a destructible section of the floor. Blow up the magma deposit to reveal another Mask Shard.Mask Shard #4: ShellwoodGetting this particular Mask Shard can be quite a challenge in and of itself. Here's a quick summary:Upon arriving at Shellwood, take the top-left exit in the first room and ride the elevator down in the second chamber.Go to the lower-left exit to encounter Shakra the map vendor.In the next room--i.e. the vertical one in the center of the zone--you're going to see a bunch of white flowers and a Lost Flea.You need to use the "pogo maneuver"--i.e. do a downward slash while in mid-air--so you can bounce off the flowers. Do this as you avoid the spikes until you're almost at the top of the chamber.Take the exit to the right to find yourself in a horizontal room with more white flowers and rows of spikes on the ceiling and floor. There's a Mask Shard waiting for you if you successfully navigate this hazardous terrain.Mask Shard #5: Deep Docks/The MarrowTo get this Mask Shard, you must have the Cling Grip ability--i.e. wall climb/wall jump--which comes from the Shellwood region. Once you've unlocked it, return to The Marrow and take the lower-right exit that leads to Deep Docks. Cling onto the rock formation and hop on the ledges until you reach a gauntlet battle.Mask Shard #6: Bellhart/Far FieldsThis Hollow Knight: Silksong Mask Shard actually comes from a Grand Hunt bounty. Here's the gist:Make sure you've completed the main quest to cleanse the curse in the Bellhart settlement.Keep progressing/exploring until you unlock the Grand Hunt: Savage Beastfly bounty at the Bellhart board.Accept the bounty and return to where you faced the Fourth Chorus boss earlier in the campaign.The Savage Beastfly will appear in that location. It still has the same old attacks, but there are some notable differences:
The enemy mobs that it summons now spit fireballs.You're fighting on destructible floors. That means the Savage Beastfly's downward ram attacks also break the ground in the arena.Defeat the Savage Beastfly and pick up the Horn Fragment. Return to the Bellhart bounty board to complete the quest.Mask Shard #7: Far FieldsThis is one of the hardest Mask Shards to obtain, especially if you dislike gauntlet battles and platforming:You need the Clawline Grappling Hook for this one. The Faydown Cloak/Double Jump also helps, though it's not necessary.Go to the marked location seen in the image above. It's at the top section of the corridor to the right of where you met the Seamstress NPC.Enter the mini-dungeon. Hit the magma ores to blow up the ground and walls.Make your way to the very bottom of the pit. This triggers a gauntlet battle where you have to face four waves of flying enemies. The platforms also disappear periodically, so you have to grapple/cling on the wall while fighting everyone.After defeating your foes, the lava will start to rise. That means you have to return to the very top of the mini-dungeon. This is a rushed platforming section where speed is of the essence.At the entrance, a wind current will form, allowing you to reach a hidden nook above you.Mask Shard #8: The Citadel - Choral Chambers/Cogwork CoreYou need to put in a bit of effort if you want to acquire this Hollow Knight: Silksong Mask Shard:Make your way to the Citadel and reach the upper corridors of the Choral Chambers section--i.e. Songclave/First Shrine or others nearby.Head to the central tower known as Cogwork Core and clear the Cogwork Dancers boss fight.Drop down and keep left. The mid-left exit leads to a gauntlet room where you have to eliminate several enemies while the floors keep collapsing.Take the top-left path afterward. You'll stumble upon a nook in Choral Chambers that has this reward.Mask Shard #9: The Citadel - Choral Chambers/SongclaveYou can purchase this Mask Shard from a merchant named Jubilana in Songclave - Choral Chambers. It costs 750 Rosaries. That said, there are some additional requirements:Reach Songclave/First Shrine and ring the bell. Talk to the Caretaker NPC who'll tell you that pilgrims will be arriving soon.Fast travel to another region and/or defeat the Cogwork Dancers. When you return to Songclave, a bulletin board should appear.Accept the Wandering Merchant wish/side quest and locate Jubilana.Jubilana is in a small room at the left-hand side of the western Choral Chambers tower/vertical chamber. Kill the enemies in the room to make the NPC appear.When you return to Songclave, Jubilana should be there and you'll be able to purchase items.Mask Shard #10: The Citadel - Whispering VaultsThis Mask Shard comes from Whispering Vaults. Specifically, it's in the lower-right section of the sub-zone. You'll notice a short corridor that's almost empty. However, if you strike the ceiling, a hidden trapdoor will be revealed. This allows you to wall-jump and hit the large block. Go back to the top to claim your prize.Mask Shard #11: Mount FayThis Hollow Knight: Silksong Mask Shard is easy enough to find, as it's in the lower-left corner of Mount Fay. Unfortunately, there are a couple of problems. Firstly, it's that Mount Fay is an inhospitable place due to freezing temperatures. Secondly, you need to obtain the Faydown Cloak/Double Jump ability, which is singularly the toughest platforming challenge in the entire game.Mask Shard #12: Weavenest AtlaYou can pick up this upgrade by gaining access to the Weavenest Atla region. This is done by using the Needolin ability from the Bellhart boss to open the cocoon door in Moss Grotto. Also, you need the aforementioned Faydown Cloak/Double Jump ability.Use the teleporter to go down to the bottommost floor.Double jump and wall climb to reach the middle section.Make a right and pick up the Rune Harp quest item.Go to the bottom-right corner of the room that has the Rune Harp. Smack the wall to reveal a hidden passageway.Use your double jump and grapple to cross the gap and avoid the lava flows.Mask Shard #13: Blasted StepsYou need both the Clawline Grappling Hook and Faydown Cloak/Double Jump for this Hollow Knight: Silksong Mask Shard:From Shellwood, keep going left until you arrive at the bottommost corridor of Blasted Sands.At the far-left part of the area, you should see a ledge above you. Stand on the raised section and sprint/dash. Then, do a long jump and throw out your Grappling Hook. As Hornet moves forward, perform your Double Jump to reach the ledge.From here, you have to do a combination of jumps, grapples, and wall clings as you make your way to the room at the top.Mask Shard #14: BilewaterWe have to admit that this Mask Shard health upgrade really frustrated us to no end. Basically, there's a section in Bilewater just above the room where you encounter Shakra the map vendor.This area has an unbelievably brutal platforming/survival section where you have to contend with Slubberlug enemies. These critters jump up from the murky water, gobbling you up and dunking you into the fetid pools. Oh, and the water is filled with maggots. They'll drain your silk gradually. You need to heal up once or rest on a bench just to get rid of them.Mask Shard #15: The SlabThis Mask Shard comes from The Slab, the prison area that you visit if you want to reach Mount Fay for the Faydown Cloak/Double Jump ability. The main shaft has a door at the top that's locked. To open it, you must obtain the Key of Apostate from the Putrefied Ducts region. It's in the bottom-left corner of that zone.Once you have the Key of Apostate, return to The Slab and unlock the aforementioned door. This leads you to a couple of chambers with difficult platforming sections. The idea is to "ride" the spinning spiked wheel via your pogo maneuver, which helps you reach the top of the room.Mask Shard #16: Wisp ThicketThe Wisp Thicket sub-zone is connected to Greymoor--i.e. the upper-left exit past the area with spikes and balloons. Once there, head to the far-right part of the sub-zone. There's a corridor here where the floors and ceilings are lined with traps, and you also need to avoid flame-spewing enemies.Once you reach the end, hop on the ledges and cross the maggot pool. Then, wall-climb/grapple to get to the nook at the top.Mask Shard #17: Mount Fay (Act 3 only)Several Mask Shards in Hollow Knight: Silksong can only be obtained during the game's third act. This is unlocked upon completing the Silk and Soul quest and defeating the "final boss."Progress further into Act 3 until you acquire the Silksoar ability, which is pretty much the game's version of the super jump. Next, return to the area of Mount Fay seen in the inset image above. Use your super jump to boost your way through the shaft and enter a small area called Brightvein. There's another platforming section that awaits you, one where you have to pogo, wall-climb, and grapple your way to the very top of the chamber.Mask Shard #18: Far Fields - Fastest in Pharloom (Act 3 only)To receive this Hollow Knight: Silksong Mask Shard, you must defeat Sprintmaster Swift in all three races:This area in Far Fields can only be unlocked while you're tackling The Old Hearts main quest during Act 3.Sprintmaster Swift is ridiculously fast, so you might want to equip the Silkspeed Anklets. You can find it in Weavenest Cindril in the lower-right corner of Far Fields.If your opponent is too far ahead, you can hold the Needolin button to restart the race.Note that you'll only receive a Rosary Necklace and a Beast Shard after winning the first two races. If you still mange to win the third, that's when Sprintmaster Swift offers you the Mask Shard.Mask Shards #19 and 20: Bellhart (Act 3 only)Speaking of the bounty board in Bellhart, well, there are actually two more Mask Shards to obtain during the closing chapter of the game. These come from the following wishes/quests which eventually become available as you progress through the chapter:Dark Hearts - This quest appears on the bounty board once you've talked to the Snail Shamans in Moss Grotto. The goal of this mission is to destroy Void Masses in various locations throughout Pharloom. Think of these as objects and enemies covered in black goop. They've been stuck on walls and they tend to whip you with tendrils if you get too close. Take out 12 of these to claim your prize.Hidden Hunter - This wish appears while you're tackling The Old Hearts quest. It popped up for us after we defeated the target in Far Fields for the Hunter's Heart objective. In any case, this is a Grand Hunt quest, which means you need to track down and eliminate a boss. Your target is named Gurr the Outcast who's found near the rightmost section of Far Fields.That does it for our guide on where to find all Mask Shards in Hollow Knight: Silksong. If you managed to obtain all of these, then you should have five additional health pips to improve Hornet's survivability. While you're at it, you might as well acquire several Spool Fragments to boost your maximum silk energy, too. Lastly, don't forget to look for Pale Oil weapon upgrades to boost your offensive capabilities.Play as Hornet and brave the dangers of the Kingdom of Pharloom.
