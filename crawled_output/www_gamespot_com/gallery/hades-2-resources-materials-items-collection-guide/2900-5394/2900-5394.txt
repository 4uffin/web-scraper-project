Hades 2 has so many items for you to amass, that things can get very confusing within a couple of hours. As such, it's important to ascertain where you need to go and what implements you need to bring. Here's our guide on where to find all resources and materials in Hades 2. Likewise, please be reminded that this article contains spoilers.Where to find all resources and materials in Hades 2Our Hades 2 resources and materials guide is organized a certain way. We've grouped up certain items based on their location (i.e. Crossroads, dungeon zones, and more). These are even those that are found in the Surface World. Likewise, we have a few sections with items that are part of a certain theme or activity.Furthermore, it's worth noting that the vast majority of these materials can be collected if you have certain Gathering Tools equipped:Crescent Pick - Used to mine ore deposits.Silver Spade - Used to dig up dirt mounds to obtain seeds.These resources are then used for the following mechanics:Incantations/AlchemyNocturnal ArmsArcana CardsRomantic interactionsShare this GalleryLatest Image GalleriesHades 2 - All Keepsakes And How To Unlock ThemHades 2 - How To Unlock Animal Familiars And PetsHades 2 Arcana Guide And The Best Arcana Cards To UseCommon rewards in dungeon roomsThese resources tend to appear in dungeons. They might be rewards when you clear rooms, or you'd see them being sold by Charon. Some NPCs (i.e. Narcissus) might also hand them to you when you speak with them:Bones - Used to purchase materials from the Wretched Broker.Ashes - Used to unlock and upgrade Arcana Cards.Psyche - Used to increase Grasp points so you can equip more Arcana Cards.Nectar - Given as gifts to supporting characters so you can obtain their Keepsakes.Obols/gold coins - Used to buy items from shops/wells in the dungeon (i.e. Charon's or Hermes').Charon's Shop/Obol Points - Receive one of these for every 1,000 gold you spend on items sold by Charon. You can then use Obol Points to order resources from Charon's Chest in the Crossroads.Crossroads NPCs and featuresThese items are mostly found in the Crossroads. They're either rewarded when you complete certain objectives, or purchased/ordered from NPCs.The Wretched Broker sells:1x Ashes for 15x Bones5x Psyche for 30x Bones1x Fate Fabric for 60x Bones1x Moon Dust for 80x Bones1x Star Dust for 800x Bones1x Nightmare for 1,000x BonesNote that you can sell the fish you've caught to earn Bones, too.Charon's Chest, meanwhile, lets you order several materials in exchange for the aforementioned Obol Points. You need to complete encounters until they're ready to be picked up. These include:AshesPsycheFate FabricMoon DustThe Fated List also has an assortment of resources that you can receive as rewards if you complete objective tallies (i.e. choose all boons from a deity). Lastly, the Rubbish item is dropped by Eris at the Crossroads. You're bound to see some trash near her spot, which is just behind Moros/the Fated List.Plants that come from gardeningThese Hades 2 resources and materials come from the game's gardening mechanic. Here's what you need to do:Unlock the Silver Spade tool and equip it when you make your dungeon delves.If you see a mound of dirt, use the Silver Spade to dig for seedlings.Back at the Crossroads, complete these incantations when they become available:
