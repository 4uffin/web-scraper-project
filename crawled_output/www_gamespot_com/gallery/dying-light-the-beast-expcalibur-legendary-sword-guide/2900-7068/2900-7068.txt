Are you hoping to find the EXPCalibur in Dying Light: The Beast? This legendary sword awaits brave explorers who set out into the unknown. That said, you also need to obtain special stones for your offering. Our guide has all the details that you need to acquire this reward.Where to find the EXPCalibur in Dying Light: The Beast - All Stone Sigil locationsThe EXPCalibur--or EXPCalibur II if you want to be more specific--is a legendary long sword. It's located due northeast of the Monastery, and it's also fairly close to where you tackle the "Chain Reaction" side quest.The sword itself is partially buried in the ground, high atop a foreboding rock formation. You need to do a bit of parkouring--i.e. running along walls and jumping off branches--just to reach it. However, there's not much that you can do right from the get-go. That's because you also need to find eight Stone Sigils scattered throughout Castor Woods.Share this GalleryLatest Image GalleriesPlayStation State Of Play September 2025: All The Biggest Announcements And GamesCoD: Black Ops 7 Zombies Adds Zombie Bears, Bees, And A Pack-a-Punched VehicleThe Best Games Of 2025 (So Far)EXPCalibur and Stone Sigils mapThe map above shows the location of the Dying Light: The Beast EXPCalibur legendary sword. We've also marked the exact spots where you'd find the eight Stone Sigils: Void, Moon, Witch's Mark, Sacrifice, Death, Blood, Curse, and Shadow. We've organized the rest of our guide based on how close these items are to the EXPCalibur's location.Stone Sigil of the Void locationYou should see a couple of waterfalls due southeast of the Monastery. Check the back of the waterfall at a higher level and pass through the cave. You'll stumble upon a note and, to your left, you'll notice a pool of water. Dive and keep spamming your Survivor Sense to ping the object's location.Stone Sigil of the Moon locationThere's another Stone Sigil in Dying Light: The Beast, and it's actually close to where you found the previous one. Simply climb up the rock formation until you see an opening. Inside, you'll discover a tranquil glade and a tent. The object is on a rock at the right-hand side.Stone Sigil of the Witch's Mark locationTo obtain this Stone Sigil, you need to go to the river inlet at the base of the cliff between the Mountain Shelter Town safe spot and Mountain Relay substation. There might be a few undead enemies lurking around, so eliminate them and enter the hut. You'll then see the item by the fireplace.Stone Sigil of Sacrifice locationThis particular Stone Sigil is in the same arena where you fought the Toxic Chimera boss in case you've progressed further into the campaign. From the center of the arena, look for a set of ruins that has a desiccated corpse. Turn around to pick up the item, which has been glued to one of the pillars.Stone Sigil of Death locationKeep collecting more Stone Sigils to unlock the Dying Light: The Beast EXPCalibur sword. For this one, you'll want to head back to the northeastern part of Old Town near the Touristic Relay substation.Check your surroundings for a graveyard, then enter the mausoleum. Go through the crawlspace to your right to reach the crypt. Naturally, it's crawling with dozens of zombies. The good news is that most of the Biters are idle. Sneakily make your way to the angel statue at the opposite side of the room, so you can grab this item.Stone Sigil of Blood locationYes, you need to look for another statue. This time, it's the maiden's fountain just outside St. Valentine's Asylum. Pick up the item while avoiding the undead.Stone Sigil of the Curse locationThere's another Dying Light: The Beast Stone Sigil found in The Vale. It's due northeast of the Memorial Hill of Heroes. Actually, if you're tackling the "Don't Look Back in Anger" side quest, then you're bound to visit this area anyway, since it's none other than the Tree of Madness.Check the back of the gnarled tree's base. You should spot an ancient and grimy skeleton surrounded by countless corpses. Grab the Stone Sigil and leave the creepy place immediately.Stone Sigil of Shadow locationThe last Stone Sigil, assuming you've been collecting them from south to north, is the easiest one to find. It doesn't really require a lot of effort because it's in the Exiles' Cave, which you automatically unlock as you progress through the campaign. Check the rest area with the bean bag and candles to claim the item.Pulling out the EXPCalibur and checking its statsNow that you've found all eight Stone Sigils, it's time to return to the bluff that has the EXPCalibur. Here's what you need to do next:Place all eight objects at the edges and be ready for a fight.An elite undead will spawn, and it will attempt to push you off the rock formation.After taking out your foe, press and hold the interact button to pull the sword from the stone. Note that this whole process takes roughly three minutes or more, so just keep the button held down.Eventually, Kyle Crane will successfully pull out the sword, netting you your reward and its blueprint.The EXPCalibur has the following stats and quirks:+20% damage (headshot or headstrike)+6% damage against infected+10% XP gained160 durability but it's irreparable. If it breaks, you can craft a new one since you already have the blueprint.That does it for our guide on how to get the EXPCalibur in Dying Light: The Beast. If you're keen on searching for other goodies, you can take a look at our Beaver's Stick guide. We also have a legendary weapons guide with all the mighty armaments that you can obtain in the game.
