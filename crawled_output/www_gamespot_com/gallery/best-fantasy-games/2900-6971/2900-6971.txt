Fantasy games take you away from any semblance of the real world, instead trading in unique worlds and universes, often featuring magic, but sometimes lean into fantasy technology as well. These games are often in the RPG genre, and many of them feature open-worlds as well. The most important and defining aspect of fantasy games are their settings though, featuring magical creatures and special powers.There are tons of fantastic offerings, but we've narrowed it down to 15 of the best fantasy games. While we tried to get a nice mix of titles on the list, we've focused on more modern games, since those are readily available to pick up and play on modern platforms.Share this GalleryLatest Image GalleriesHow To Complete The Verdania Green Prince Quest In Hollow Knight: SilksongAll Mister Mushroom Locations In Hollow Knight: SilksongWhere To Find All Silk Skills In Hollow Knight: SilksongClair Obscur: Expedition 33Developer: Sandfall InteractivePlatforms: PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PCGenre: Turn-based RPGMultiplayer: NoClair Obscur: Expedition 33 is one of the biggest hits of 2025, and while a large part of that comes from its focus on reactive dodging and parrying in its turn-based combat, its narrative and world are key components. Directly inspired by Belle Époque France, it features a ton of painterly areas and biomes. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 operates in a unique style of fantasy world not common in video games and its premise that each year a giant painter paints a lower number and everyone over that age dies allows for it to hit the ground running. It was also influenced by JRPGs, which has led to some discourse around JRPGs and Clair Obscur: Expedition 33.See at AmazonBaldur's Gate 3Developer: Larian StudiosPlatforms: PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PCGenre: CRPGMultiplayer: YesBaldur's Gate 3 is another massive and beloved RPG, with a heavy focus on classic CRPG systems and role-playing. Set in the universe of Dungeons & Dragons, the story follows your character as you recruit companions, battle your Dark Urges, and maybe even experience a bit of romance. If you have any affinity for Dungeons & Dragons, you've probably already played Baldur's Gate 3, but its depth in both narrative and class construction makes it an excellent choice for anyone that loves a hardcore RPG experience. Baldur's Gate 3 offers a variety of fantasy elements to engage with, like talking to animals, using magic spells, and even transforming into different animals, depending on your class. There are also vampires, orcs, dragons, and so many more magical creatures spread throughout its many, many, narrative threads.See at GOGThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the WildDeveloper: NintendoPlatforms: Switch, Switch 2Genre: Action-AdventureMultiplayer: NoThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is one of the greatest video games ever made, and its Hyrule Kingdom is a particular flavor of fantasy you won't find anywhere else. While Tears of the Kingdom also certainly counts, Breath of the Wild focuses more on exploration and less on contraption building, letting its fantasy setting keep its mystical feeling. Explore Hyrule, meet new friends and foes, and solve massive puzzles to help in your battle against Ganon. Hyrule also has a nice variety of environments to explore, with grassy hills, sweltering deserts, and snowy mountains.See at AmazonDragon's Dogma 2Developer: CapcomPlatforms: PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PCGenre: Action-RPGMultiplayer: NoDragon's Dogma 2 features a harsh, but classically inspired fantasy world. You can find yourself faced down by a griffin, medusa, or dragon regularly, in addition to little goblins and other monsters. It also has a reactive world, where nearly any NPC can die and the solution to some of your quests can be simple or convoluted depending on your playstyle. You can also wield magic in addition to swords and bows, plus you get to bring a party of companions, made by either you or other players. Dragon's Dogma 2 can be quite obtuse in what it's asking of you, and the performance can be rough depending on the platform, but its methodical pacing and sense of discovery is unmatched.See at AmazonMetaphor: ReFantazioDeveloper: AtlusPlatforms: PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PCGenre: Turn-based RPGMultiplayer: NoMetaphor: ReFantazio is Atlus rolling out a new turn-based RPG series after years of developing Persona and Shin Megami Tensei, this time with a fantasy setting. After the death of the king, an election is held to determine the next ruler. You and your ever-expanding party of misfits need to venture across the land, helping people in need, completing contests, and fighting for a better future. Its fantasy land has a unique spin on its world and inhabitants, and features special technology, like giant ship runners and magical staffs. The turn-based combat has a heavy focus on class archetypes that can be swapped freely, adding a layer of strategy on top of the finely-tuned combat.See at AmazonSea of StarsDeveloper: Sabotage StudioPlatforms: PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Switch, PCGenre: Turn-based RPGMultiplayer: YesSea of Stars is an indie turn-based RPG, heavily inspired by Chrono Trigger and classic Final Fantasy games. It utilizes active combat mechanics, where you have to use timed button presses to do more damage, or defend against incoming attacks, like Super Mario RPG. Sea of Stars has a gorgeous art style and a colorful fantasy world, with plenty of fun creatures and environments to discover.See at HumbleElden RingDeveloper: FromSoftwarePlatforms: PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PC, and announced for Switch 2Genre: Action-RPGMultiplayer: YesElden Ring is FromSoftware's biggest hit to date, and while its tough and grueling combat might scare some away, Elden Ring’s setting of The Lands Between is a phenomenal fantasy world to explore. It's a far more dangerous world than other entries on the list, but the massive map is filled with secrets to discover, along with some environments that can really only be described as breathtaking. If the hardcore action has scared you away, it's worth putting the practice in just to experience everything Elden Ring, and its expansion Shadow of the Erdtree have to offer.See at AmazonAvowedDeveloper: Obsidian EntertainmentPlatforms: Xbox Series X|S and PCGenre: FPS RPGMultiplayer: NoAvowed is a massive first-person fantasy RPG from Obsidian Entertainment, the developers of The Outer Worlds and the upcoming The Outer Worlds 2. Set in the Pillars of Eternity universe, you set out to the Living Lands, an island where a mysterious disease threatens all life, and you need to decide how to save it. You will gather a party, explore the lands, and make massive decisions about the future of the Living Lands and its citizens. It's also one of the more colorful fantasy settings, giving the world a sharp, vibrant color you won't find in similar RPGs.See at SteamThe Witcher 3Developer: CD Projekt RedPlatforms: PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Switch, Switch 2, PCGenre: Action-RPGMultiplayer: NoThe Witcher 3 is a beloved action-RPG, set in a dark fantasy world. Not only is there a smattering of mythical creatures you will encounter, but the wetland setting of The Witcher 3 has a distinctly eastern European feel in its design. There is romance and a seemingly endless number of high-quality side quests, allowing you to spend hundreds of hours in its world. Plus, it has Gwent in it, an incredible card game side activity.See at GOGOctopath Traveler 2Developer: Square Enix, AcquirePlatforms: PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Switch, Switch 2, PCGenre: Turn-based RPGMultiplayer: NoOctopath Traveler 2 is an HD-2D pixel art RPG from Square Enix. Its fantasy world is set in the early industrial revolution, with the invention of the steam engine and large commerce ships sailing the seas. It features eight party members, each of whom have their own individual stories for you to experience, taking you across the entire world of Octopath Traveler 2. Its fantasy world has one of the more unique looks on this list, thanks in large part to the gorgeous HD-2D art.See at AmazonDragon Quest XI S: Echoes of an Elusive AgeDeveloper: Square EnixPlatforms: PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Switch, Switch 2, PCGenre: Turn-based RPGMultiplayer: NoDragon Quest XI is a massive turn-based RPG, set in the fantasy world of Dragon Quest, best known for having slimes, shirtless buff guys, and bunny girls. DQ11 serves as a great entry into the series, as the story is disconnected from previous games. It also has tons of 2D sections, and even the option to play the main game in pixel form too. While it certainly has its moments of serious storytelling, Dragon Quest is often far more colorful and whimsical than some of the darker fantasy worlds on this list.See at HumbleTales of AriseDeveloper: Bandai NamcoPlatforms: PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PCGenre: Action-RPGMultiplayer: NoTales of Arise is the latest non-remaster entry in the series, and it's an incredible Action-RPG. You play as Alphen, an amnesiac slave with a mysterious mask on his face, and you have to venture across the world to gather allies and help deal with the divided people of the world. It dips into sci-fi, but is primarily a fantasy setting, where you will explore small towns and battle mythic creatures on your adventures. The cast of characters here are excellent, and the romance between two of the protagonists is well done.See at FanaticalXenoblade Chronicles 3Developer: Monolith SoftPlatforms: Switch, Switch 2Genre: Action-RPGMultiplayer: NoWhile you might get more out of Xenoblade Chronicles 3 after playing the first two games, you can absolutely jump straight into Monolith Soft's magnum opus. This massive RPG features action combat that functions similarly to MMO combat, with regular attacks happening automatically, while you activate special abilities. It also features plenty of sci-fi technology, but the large sprawling world filled with monsters and villains still has a strong fantasy feel. The story is the star of the show, as your crew sets out to discover if the ten-year lifespans they have been given can be extended.See at TargetFinal Fantasy VII RemakeDeveloper: Square EnixPlatforms: PS4, PS5, PC, Switch 2 (late 2025), Xbox Series X|S (late 2025)Genre: Action-RPGMultiplayer: NoThe first entry in Square Enix's ambitious remake trilogy of Final Fantasy VII, Final Fantasy VII Remake primarily covers the Midgar section of the original game. While it features helicopters, motorcycles, and other advanced technology, it still has a strong fantasy setting, even if you have to wait until FF7 Rebirth to see more of that world. Follow Cloud Strife as he and his crew battle against Shinra and Sepiroth, while utilizing a hybrid action-RPG combat system, which features small turn-based elements via the Active Time Battle system.See at AmazonFinal Fantasy XVIDeveloper: Square EnixPlatforms: PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PCGenre: Action RPGMultiplayer: NoIf FF7 Remake isn't your style of fantasy world, Final Fantasy 16 offers a more traditional fantasy world, taking heavy inspirations from Game of Thrones. Follow Clive Rosfield, a warrior determined to get his revenge on the Dark Eikon Ifrit. The world doesn't have any sci-fi elements in terms of its technology, but it does have both fast-paced action combat and giant monster battles, making it feel dynamic from battle to battle.See at Amazon
