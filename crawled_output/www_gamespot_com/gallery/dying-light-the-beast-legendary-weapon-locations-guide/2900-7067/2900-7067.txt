Are you planning to find all legendary weapons in Dying Light: The Beast? As you progress through the campaign, you'll acquire all sorts of gear pieces, starting from common items to those with higher rarities. Legendaries tend to be the most unique--they either have several innate perks and modifiers or they deal more damage compared to their counterparts. Our guide has all the information that you need to obtain these rewards for combat and for your collection.Where to find all legendary weapons in Dying Light: The BeastAs of the time of this writing, we've discovered 15 legendary weapons in the game. Note that we didn't include most of the generic throwable items, such as remote C4s and all sorts of mines. We did, however, include certain rewards because they're fun Easter eggs to discover.Note 1: Several of these weapons can be yours if you decipher the illustrations on treasure maps. For more details, you can check our Treasure Hunt guide.Note 2: Some legendary melee weapons still lose durability even though they can't be repaired. The good news is that you automatically receive their blueprints so you can craft them again later in the game.Share this GalleryLatest Image GalleriesPlayStation State Of Play September 2025: All The Biggest Announcements And GamesCoD: Black Ops 7 Zombies Adds Zombie Bears, Bees, And A Pack-a-Punched VehicleThe Best Games Of 2025 (So Far)Castor Woods map of all legendary weapon locationsThe map above shows the locations of all legendary weapons in Dying Light: The Beast. We've organized our guide to primarily focus on a couple that come from skill point unlocks. Then, we move from the southern portion of the map--i.e. where you started the campaign--all the way to the north.FlamethrowerType: Special ranged weaponLocation: N/A - Unlocked via the "Flamethrower" skill.Effect/perks: N/A - Burns enemies to a crisp.Note: The Flamethrower might be one of the first Dying Light: The Beast legendary weapons that you obtain in the game since you only need to allocate a single skill point to unlock it. That said, you can also find an extra one in the armory just before you face the final boss of the campaign.Grenade LauncherType: Special ranged weaponLocation: N/A - Unlocked via the "Grenade Launcher" skill.Effect/perks: N/A - Allows you to craft different kinds of ammo--i.e. explosive, freezing, incendiary, shock, and UV.The EliteType: PistolLocation: A reward from the B4 Treasure Hunt. Use the keycard to open the train cargo at the railway bridge east of the Monastery.Effect/perks: N/ALast Hand of GlovaType: ConsumableLocation: Go to the tunnel at the opposite side of the railway bridge where you picked up The Elite. There's a brick wall there, but it's actually fake and you can pass through it. Destroy the blocks with two-handed melee weapons and clear out the enemies. You'll find the Last Hand of Glova, along with several Golden Train Tickets, at the end.Effect/perks: Allows you to cast a fireball.Note 1: The Last Hand of Glova is a consumable--i.e. it's in the same slot as your bandages and medkits. It has three charges by default. Once used up, you can craft additional ones since you also receive the blueprint for it.Note 2: What makes the Last Hand of Glova such a unique legendary weapon in Dying Light: The Beast is that it has three references or Easter eggs rolled into one:The Glova items have been around in previous games in the series, as well as the Dead Island titles, which Techland also developed.The design of the blocks and the process of going through the tunnels is a reference to Minecraft.As for the hand animations when casting, they're quite reminiscent of character abilities in Naruto. How's that for some fire jutsu techniques.The fire blast being able to clear waves of undead is just icing on the cake.The NeedleType: SMGLocation: Found in the Park Ranger Station near the Mountain Tower Shelter safe spot. It's a reward for the A1 Treasure Hunt.Effect/perks: N/ACiupagaType: One-handed axeLocation: Found above the awnings of the Misty Forest Resort.

There, you'll see the Silos safe zone. This structure presents a challenge, since you need to climb all the way up just to find the generator. Then, you have to carefully drop down to restore power to the facility. Once you've done that, you can claim the blueprint from the workbench. The blueprint for another weapon, the Good Night, is also on the same workbench.Effect/perks: N/ANote: What makes the Sawblade Launcher one of the best legendary weapons in Dying Light: The Beast is that its serrated spinning blades guarantee an instant-kill upon hitting a zombie.
