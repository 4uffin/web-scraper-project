Hades 2 pits you against countless foes, each deadlier than the last. Naturally, you're going to need weapons that can lay waste to your opponents. Here's our guide on how unlock all weapons and aspects in Hades 2.How to unlock all weapons and weapon aspects in Hades 2Trying to unlock all weapons and aspects in Hades 2 can be downright convoluted at times. Although weapon unlock mechanics are fairly straightforward, the means of acquiring their aspects still remains uncertain (we were genuinely surprised when we received a prompt about it during our playthrough).In any case, our Hades 2 weapon and aspect unlock guide first discusses how each weapon is obtained. This section is followed by tips on how to use these armaments effectively, along with suggestions on ideal Daedalus Hammer upgrades. Finally, we discuss the incantation that lets you choose additional aspects.As an aside, we also have a best boons/skills guide. You can check our suggestions to learn of synergies among various skills and armaments.Share this GalleryLatest Image GalleriesHades 2 - All Keepsakes And How To Unlock ThemHades 2 - How To Unlock Animal Familiars And PetsHades 2 Arcana Guide And The Best Arcana Cards To UseAll unlockable weapons in Hades 2At launch, there are six weapons available in Hades 2. You can find the full list and how to unlock them below:Witch's Staff - This weapon is available by default.Sister Blades - Requires 1x Silver. This resource can be mined in the Erebus zone if you have the Crescent Pick gathering tool.Moonstone Axe - Requires 15x Silver. This just means you have to keep redoing runs while hoping that there are several Silver nodes in Erebus.Umbral Flames - Requires 3x Silver and 3x Cinder. The latter is dropped by Hecate, the boss of the Erebus region.Xinth: You can get the Black Coat after fighting Prometheus at least once. If you don't see it, try mining Adamant in Mount Olympus, as well as doing runs in the Underworld. It's bound to appear on its own after a while.Argent Skull - The Argent Skull doesn't appear right from the get-go. You have to progress a bit by doing some extra runs. Later, you can acquire it by spending:
2x Glassrock/G.Rock - Take the Crescent Pick and continue on your journey until you reach the Fields of Mourning (i.e. the third zone in the Underworld). Once there, look for black mineral deposits.1x Bronze - Bronze only comes from the surface world, specifically the City of Ephyra. Reaching it is quite a complicated process, but we have a surface world/wards guide to help you out.Tips when using the Witch's StaffGiven that the Witch's Staff is the default weapon in the game, it's also the most beginner-friendly. You'll probably make use of it for a very long time since it's quite reliable.The attack and omega attack are nothing to write home about, but the special move is great, especially once you pick up the Double Moonshot from the Daedalus Hammer boon. With it, your specials fire two projectiles that seek enemies. This is ideal if you just want to hang back and shoot opponents from afar.As for ideal god boons, you'll want to acquire Apollo's Nova Flourish and Artemis' Support Fire. The former increases the size and damage of your specials (akin to large golden orbs). The latter causes seeking arrows to fly out to hit hostiles whenever you use attacks and specials.Tips when using the Sister BladesThe Sister Blades (i.e. dual daggers) might be the best weapon in Hades 2. It's because of its high attack speed and bonus damage when hitting enemies from behind (i.e. backstab). Ideally, you should get the Skulking Slice boon from the Daedalus Hammer, while also pairing it up with boons from the following gods:Hephaestus - Powerful blasts triggered by your attacks.Aphrodite - Increased damage against opponents that are very close.Demeter - Freeze hostiles then backstab them.Artemis - Fast attack speed means you get more chances to land crits eventually.Tips when using the Moonstone AxeThe Moonstone Axe is a slow weapon that packs a tremendous punch. You're guaranteed to hit multiple creatures with its wide-arc swings, followed by a crushing overhead smash at the end of the attack combo chain. The special, meanwhile, can block some enemy attacks (it's not as good as the Shield of Chaos from the first game).The two most viable Daedalus Hammer upgrades for the Moonstone Axe are:Hell Splitter - Your attack becomes an overhead chop that has 300 power.Executioner's Chop - The final move in your attack sequence hits twice, but it uses 20 magick.These two offer amazing synergy because all your attacks will be limited to just the overhead smash, which also counts as the "final move" in the sequence. In short, every attack you do has the 300-power buff that ends up hitting twice. The only downside is that basic attacks will deplete your magick quickly, so you need god boons and Arcana Cards that help with mana regen. Lastly, since you're using a ton of mana in each encounter, you might want to double-up with certain Selene blessings/upgrades.Tips when using the Umbral FlamesThe Umbral Flames is primarily for medium-range combat. Its basic attack shoots out spectral orbs, and its special/omega special causes several fireballs to surround you. The problem is that it doesn't do as much damage as the other armaments in the game. Similarly, you have to hold down the attack button for a longer time to continue using the omega ability. This can be risky since you still need to avoid enemies.If you really want to keep using it, then we suggest grabbing upgrades/boons from the Daedalus Hammer (Growing Coils) and Artemis (Support Fire). Spam your special as often as you'd like, and look for god boons that make your special inflict debuffs.Tips when using the Argent SkullThink of the Argent Skull as a shotgun, since it fires skulls that deal high damage. Its special move, meanwhile, causes Melinoe to rush forward while beams erupt along the sides. One potential issue you might face is that the skull ammunition needs to be picked up just so you can attack again, making the process a bit confusing.However, if you can find the Bolstered Array upgrade from a Daedalus Hammer, you get extra skull ammo. This is further complemented by Full Salvo, which lets you fire all skull shells at once in a spread pattern. This can annihilate foes if you hit them with all shells at point-blank range.Tips when using Xinth, the Black CoatXinth is an extremely versatile weapon, allowing you to block attacks before dealing a powerful uppercut, launch a barrage of rockets, and much more. Plus, it allows you to move fast with Melinoë using the weapon like a jetpack.If you stumble upon Daedalus upgrades, Exhaust Riser (dash-strike hits three additional times), Furious Rockets (your special's rockets launch and fly faster), and Counter Barrage (after blocking with your omega attack, your special auto-fires shots) are all great options.Incantation: Aspects of Night and DarknessYou can continue playing to your heart's content without realizing that there are additional unlockable weapon aspects in Hades 2. That's because an incantation called Aspects of Night and Darkness only appears much later. Here's what we did in our playthrough:We had already unlocked all five weapons.We used them in multiple runs.We've defeated Hecate many times, but we can't confirm if we were able to do this with all five different weapons.Eventually, after one such victory against Hecate, she'll mention the Aspects of Night and Darkness, which then becomes available in the cauldron at the Crossroads. To complete this incantation, you'll need:5x Bronze - Keep returning to the City of Ephyra and look for deposits that you can mine using the Crescent Pick.1x Nightshade - You'll need the Flourishing Soul incantation to create more plots for your garden, as well as the Silver Spade gathering tool. Dig up mounds of dirt in Erebus to find Nightshade Seeds, then plant these in your garden. After this, complete five encounters until they're ready to be harvested.Note that this also makes the Abyssal Insight incantation available. This leads to additional activities known as Chaos Trials.All weapon aspects in Hades 2Once the Aspects of Night and Darkness incantation is complete, return to Melinoe's room. You'll notice that you can now view and unlock weapon aspects in Hades 2.There are a total of four aspects for each weapon type. One is the Aspect of Melinoe, which is the default option (i.e. what you've gotten used to this whole time). Three more can be unlocked and subsequently leveled up to increase their effects, one of them being a Hidden Aspect that requires some extra steps.To unlock a Hidden Aspect, you have to unlock all available aspects for a weapon, upgrade one of them to level five, speak to a specific NPC to unlock a Waking Phrase, and then interact with the Waking Pool, where you select your weapon before a run.Witch's StaffAspect of Melinoe
