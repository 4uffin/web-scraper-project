The most obvious one here was the official confirmation of Forza Horizon 6 and its Japan setting, alongside other reveals like a full remake of 2022’s Gungrave Gore, a new cast member for 007: First Light, and multiplayer maps set in Japan for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7.In case you missed it, you can scroll down for a quick recap of everything that was announced.Share this GalleryLatest Image GalleriesHades 2 - All Keepsakes And How To Unlock ThemHades 2 - How To Unlock Animal Familiars And PetsHades 2 Arcana Guide And The Best Arcana Cards To UseGungrave Gore: Blood HeatOver-the-top action series Gungrave is making a comeback, and as you'd expect from this series, it looks heavy on action and massively oversized guns.
