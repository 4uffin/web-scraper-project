Hades 2 Review
Hades 2 exits early access as a finely-honed and deeply engaging roguelite that builds upon the strong foundations established by the first game. It's larger in every way, with more characters and conversations to enjoy, an entirely new roster of weapons to learn, and deeper customization options to its expanded combat system, yet none of these upgrades compromise Hades' legacy. Rather, Hades 2 improves upon its predecessor in every way, making it a masterfully crafted sequel that is essential to play.
