I have a habit of selecting and highlighting text on computer screens, while reading. I have no issues tracking lines usually, but somehow I still select and highlight. Maybe it is just easier to track lines this way. When I see some web page, that prevents this, then that website gets a -50 reputation score out of 100 in my book. So if the site is perfect in every other way (almost no site is) then -50 still makes it pretty terrible. If additionally it would actually be useful in other ways to highlight and copy text on a site, then I get really annoyed by web non-sense like that. Similarly I get annoyed, if every pixel is some clickable action trigger.This is not what hypertext has been created for. Stop making the web into a cesspit of bad accessibility.replywill_pseudonym 6 hours ago

Me three, there are many dozens of us!Compulsive selecting while reading, and hitting CTRL+S every couple seconds while editing documents, are the two "weird" habits I couldn't kick for decades now. Most of the time, I'm not even conscious I'm doing those things; I only notice when the text isn't selectable or the program pops up a modal in response to CTRL+S.replyjonnat 5 hours ago

With PDF you can have vector text that isn't detected as text.

You can also have scanned bitmap pages with no underlying OCR text layer for the reader to make selections from. PDF text detection and selection is a black art.replyShorel 5 hours ago

I must admit, one of my favorite recent-ish Android[1] features is that all text is made selectable in the app switcher using on-device OCR.

Blocking screenshots for certain apps has been like "someone drowned in a lake -> block access to the lake".The only thing it helps in is helping banks close the tickets when you inform them of a bug and they ask for screenshots and you tell them you can't because their app doesn't allow it, so "… closing this ticket since we received no further input from the customer. Please feel free to reply if you need anything else."They never tell me to take a photo from another app and I never volunteer to do that because if they reply like this I know they are not going to work on the bug.replydigianarchist 5 hours ago

Yes, I just wanted to reply the same thing. It's a great feature for these use cases (albeit, I too would like to see more universal or friendlier approach to text-selectability in apps).Additionally, the text copied in this manner can be instantly opened in Clipboard editor (at least on Google Pixel), and when selected again there, it offers even more contextual options, such as translate in one of your installed apps (like Deepl).That way, you can translate the "non-selectable" text in a very few short taps.replybapak 6 hours ago

As a web dev, I fully agree with this, but with a huge exception: clickable text.Anything that is meant to be read as content should absolutely, without fail, be selectable and copyable (assuming appropriate permissions).But stuff like tab headers, buttons, or even text-sparse tiles - things meant for the user to click on - can, and usually should, prevent text selection. It is super annoying to be clicking back and forth through tabs only to have some text erroneously highlight and then stay that way.Exceptions to every rule, and to every exception of that rule, of course. But for the most part, allowing text highlighting in those clickable areas is a rough UX.* note that I did not include anchor links; those are meant to be inline within text content and should therefore be selectable.replysethammons 7 hours ago

No, text should be selectable, even when links. The amount of times I've accidentally highlighted instead of clicking? Maybe a couple? The amount of times that frustrated or confused me? Absolutely zero.I want to select the text of a link and copy the text of a link. I want to do this but I run into issues _daily_, esp. on mobile. PagerDuty app, I'm looking at you!

Being unable to select text out of a link is absolutely infuriating when you want to just copy a piece of it, either because it's a reference number or something, or you want to translate it. Mobile is nearly impossible, and desktop is also fiddly in many cases.Often when translating it's easier to just OCR the area with the dictionary app, which is madness when it started as text.replyjayknight 5 hours ago

Something I absolutely loved while working at Meta was that basically every internal system has some kind of ticket ID, and more importantly, wherever it's displayed near the top of the page you very likely can click-to-copy it. And the click-to-copy gives you a rich version of the ticket ID that you could paste into Google Docs and have the link to the ticket page embedded already. Really small feature that improved the life of engineers a lot considering how much you're copy/pasting IDs around. It's the type of UX care that I expect ServiceNow type third party systems will never have.replykuekacang 7 hours ago

Recently I've been considering simple click-to-copy button is a bad ux since it can destroy one's clipboard (granted, I'm not using clipboard manager). This might be mitigated with a confirmation before actually replacing the clipboard, but I haven't encountered such implementation. Maybe due to ctc more often appear in tech-related websites.replyp1mrx 7 hours ago
| root | parent | next [–]
Instead of click-to-copy, you could do click-to-highlight, so that "right-click > Copy" highlights the text on right-click if it's not initially selected. There is some subtlety in the logic, because it shouldn't interfere when the user manually selects a substring.For a demo of click-to-highlight, install IPvFoo and use your mouse in the popup window. See the 'selectWholeAddress' function in https://github.com/pmarks-net/ipvfoo/blob/master/src/popup.j...replykuekacang 1 hour ago
| root | parent | next [–]
I'm aware of that gesture, but I think it shows the point that it requires extra intention from the user to do select+copy on an input-looking field with copy button attached, instead of being part if the default ctc button experience.Not that I am searching, but I wonder if there's already tog/nielson/other ux research on this specific interaction.replykevin_thibedeau 5 hours ago

Surely. First time I used clipboard management was long time ago somewhen in windows xp era. But growing older make me not really incentivized on trying myself to relearn clipboard history gestures.

Then all those nav headers need to have a little button on the side to open a floating div with copy-pasteable content.

100% disagree.Not everyone is fluent in every language, and not every website works perfectly with the browser's translator.There will be situations where people will want to translate that ONE word that is actually in a button or tab, and isn't selectable because someone thought they knew better.replythrowaway0123_5 7 hours ago

In Firefox my tabs have text, and I frequently rearrange tabs with my cursor. I think this is a pretty common usage pattern (I do it on a daily basis). It would be an enormous pain if most of the area on the tab turned my arrow cursor into an I-beam cursor that I couldn't move the tab with. I checked Chrome and it looks like the tabs work the same way.While having the text in the tabs is very useful to know what is under them, I don't think I've ever needed to actually copy the tab text. It would be a huge UX downgrade for me (and I think most people) if the tab text was selectable.Some people might need it to be selectable for accessibility reasons and there should be a toggle for that, but I don't think "absolutely all text everywhere is selectable" is a good default.replyTeMPOraL 4 hours ago
| root | parent | next [–]
That's arguably the problem of the common interaction patterns in GUIs being non-modal. Could've been easily solved early on by having a convention like "holding Meta (Alt) makes all text on screen selectable" and sticking with it.At this point, it's not even a technical problem anymore - it's a social one. Even if somehow OS and browser vendors all agreed on a scheme like this, copyright industry and security people would scream bloody murder and prevent it from being implemented.replywhstl 6 hours ago

The example I am answering to was prefaced as being by a web dev, so I am only talking about websites here.For Apps agree, as I can install different ones and pick the language regardless of where I am traveling, etc. And page titles (that go on browser tabs) rarely need selection/translation.replyyreg 4 hours ago

The essential case where it makes sense for text to be non-selectable is on objects that can be dragged around. You definitely don't want to get the text selected when the user wanted to move its container.Typically application tabs can be moved or recorded by dragging, and tabs in web pages can't; that would justify a different treatment. But it's because of the different behaviour of the tabs, not the different mediareplyTeMPOraL 5 hours ago

It's not just about translations, either. Sometimes you want to document or describe to someone where something is on a site. "Click on FooBar, then in the popup saying <<Are you sure FooBar is the right Frob>> check the <<Cheesy Cheese Burger>> checkbox and click OK.It's much less frustrating when you can copy-paste the damned labels straight off the site/app, than retyping them and hoping you didn't misspell FooBar as FooBaz, leading the other person into deeper trouble rather than helping.replyZYbCRq22HbJ2y7 10 hours ago

That is a i18n issue with the website itself? Or are you saying you know a good portion of a language, but you aren't fluent, so you read it in whatever the default language is, by default, without translating the page or using it in your native language?replywhstl 10 hours ago
| root | parent | next [–]
Depends. Sometimes I know the language partially, sometimes I can move around using pure context, and other times translation is possible in most pages.Disabling selection in non-textual parts of websites is unfortunately something that happens quite frequently, but people rarely notice.This is naturally for websites without i18n. Very common especially in government and public websites.replyrustystump 6 hours ago

When you run an app from the taskbar or start menu, you single-click on the app icon, or single-click on the Start menu button and then single-click on the app.Sure, icons on the desktop, or just about anything in a file/app explorer window, require a double-click by default, because the lineage of the main desktop area is just a file explorer window without the window decorations.I think it might be about stakeholders wanting the web to "feel" more native and interactive.
Double-clicking to "go" feels too much like you're interacting with the web as if it's a file browser.

You make some good points here.

I think the idea of making hyperlinks in hypertext more like a menu than like filesystem resources does make some sense, especially since the browser is an application and single-click within user applications has been pretty normal for a long time.

A case can be made for graphic like elements like buttons, but for text: treat it like text even if it's clickable.In the Web version of Outlook, there are regularly times where the location of an appointment is a street address.
That text is typically clickable.
But the click action doesn't correspond to the choice of mapping service I might want to use in any one instance or to the fact that I might have other actions, like copying the address into another email/sms/etc.
Outlook followed your philosophy.
You can't select and copy that text, save for going through several auxiliary clicks just to get to a spot where you can.
It's the most annoying behavior I can imagine.That you think that you sitting in a meeting room talking it over with colleagues, or perhaps I'm a meeting in your own mind can assign legitimate uses and not, when something other than say security might be at stake, is just wrongheaded.And by the way, that address being the link that it is is great 60%, 70% of the time.

The point isn't that the developer should disable text selection whenever he thinks it's unnecessary, which would indeed be silly.
It's that sometimes the user interface rules for navigating selectable text conflict or interfere with the user interface rules for navigating, say, a set of tab panes.
In that situation, making the tab titles selectable will cause grief.I agree with your address example.
That is user data, and it should be selectable.replysbuttgereit 2 hours ago

I don't think we disagree, too much. tab panes matches the "button" example.However, I am sympathetic to those arguing translation.
Sometimes I'll visit Japanese or Chinese websites.
With some frequency, even if most of the site has an English edition, I'll find some UI element not translated, including buttons and the like... OK I think it was the commenter that I responded to, in a different reply said... just Google it if it's a single word. Great!
But I don't even know where to begin to get the right characters from my old fashioned US keyboard.
So now I have to Google for how to use my keyboard to get the characters I want, which also may need pre-requisite knowledge of the language I'm trying to translate (radicals and all that jazz)... that's a heavier lift than may be anticipated and where a simple copy/paste into an appropriate translator would make things much, much easier.I would suggest this: make everything buttons, links, tabs, etc. selectable and copyable unless there is a real explicit and compelling reason to do otherwise.
Now to be fair, I'm old enough to have been "online" in some fashion or another since before general public internet access availability was a thing... so my expectations for butter-like user experiences are low and my desire to do any damn thing I want high... but even today, there are probably still more websites which don't stop you from copying anything than there are searching for that polished experience where only the right things can be selected.
The discontinuity and the deviation from the expectation that I can copy anything I also find as something which diminishes the user experience, even if occasionally I'm annoyed by over selecting things.replycatapart 9 hours ago

Use a mouse to click inside of a word link (like "threads") in the HN header. Try to drag to highlight. Note that the link tries to drag instead of highlighting. This is default behavior for anchors because of the issues that it would otherwise cause with the whole selection API.Alternatively, set your cursor at the end of the header in the empty space, and drag your mouse backward to highlight the items. At that point, you can highlight the text, because you started in a non-user-select-limited area.Note that this is default browser behavior. Inspect the styles and see that they have applied no selection styling to those anchors. This is the thing I'm advocating for. Make the web work like the web works, and disregard people telling you that "everything must be selectable" not because it shouldn't be, but because there are features that expect certain functionality to work well with the other features of the web.replyUkv 10 hours ago

I made myself clear to the other development professionals I was talking to as evidenced by their feedback.The people who seem to have the most trouble understanding what I'm advocating for are the people who seem to only be taking a user-centric approach to the situation, rather than grappling with the practicalities of the web environment.At this point, I'm over trying to make anyone understand anything. They'll either get it, when it is relevant for them to get it, or they won't and it won't matter to me or anyone else at all.In a year, we might have better web functionality or a new built-in browser or OS feature, or any number of other things that could mitigate this specific gripe, so I'm not super concerned about any of it. Those that understand what I'm saying will have better UX for heeding the advice with appropriate exception. And those that don't won't make UX worth using.

This breaks translation. Text must be selectable.replycatapart 10 hours ago
| root | parent | next [–]
Good UX means including translations for supported languages, not telling the user "do it yourself by highlighting content".Not translating entire articles to a language you don't support has the easy remedy of letting people select the text and use third party tools to support their specific use-cases. But not including translations for your clickable content for languages that aren't supported are the literal practical limits of ability. I would rather my apps work for people in languages I do support, with full accessibility (and minimal scripting overhead), than to have them work poorly for keyboard-only users in all languages, regardless of my app's support for them.Again, we're talking about the stuff that should be iconic. Things that can literally be represented by icons. Buttons and tab headings. Things that you shouldn't actually need translated AT ALL, much less into every single language there is.replyginko 10 hours ago

I know you're not asking me, but I would really love the "copy" feature added to ALL context menus.Right clicking a standard anchor element gives you the "copy link" option, but you don't get to copy the word without having it selected. Would be nice to just have a "copy word" feature, for starters. Could even be expanded so that it auto-selects the text after copying it so that if you wanted to copy more than just one word, you could expand the highlight (with the little widgets on mobile, or with keyboard/mouse selection in that one state on desktop) and then get a "copy text" option that copies all of the selected content.reply1718627440 9 hours ago

Bad UX is the result, from the combination of disabling text selection and being in a language you don't understand.

When I encounter a website which does not allow text selection, copying or right click, I usually enable the "Absolute Enable Right Click & Copy" browser extension which removes all of these restrictions.Such restrictive practices, in my opinion, not only make the website less useful to the user.

> It also intentionally alienates its users.Only the tinkerer-type techies. Most people don't understand why right click doesn't work, they don't have a mental model of what is responsible for what and things are often broken in mysterious ways anyway. If users are not alienated by how the web looks without an adblocker (try it once on some mainstream news site or blog or recipe site!), they surely won't be alienated by unselectable text.The rational reason is to avoid getting their content "stolen", or having the user leave the site to do something else with the saved content.replymagnio 11 hours ago

If you open an image with Google Lens (or select the image in the Google Search app, which seems to result in the same thing) Google does by default an image web search and shows you similar pictures, but it also displays a blue "translate" button on the right, which activates OCR and text selection, and optional translation.

This is why I prefer web apps over native apps. Web defaults to selectable text and text readable by extensions. I can long press on almost any word and pick "Define" if I don't understand a word (or right click on desktop). Native defaults to unselectable text and no extensions.It's also why I hate Flutter on web. They render text to canvas, suddenly nothing is selectable and so accessibility and definition/translation options don't work.See https://earth.gooogle.com Click on a city. An info box pops up. Nothing is selectable. Of course a poorly designed HTML info box could do that too but the designer has to go out of their way to make it bad whereas with Flutter (and native in general) the default is bad.replyhombre_fatal 5 hours ago

Good point.Everyone in the comments is talking about websites, but TFA is talking about the iOS Bumble app where it's trivial to unintentionally create unselectable text. e.g. SwiftUI Text components are unselectable by default.Also, in an iOS app, it's common to decide that interacting with some text should do something like navigate.IIRC tapping a comment in iOS Apollo (defunct Reddit client) would collapse the comment. If you wanted to make a text selection, the Apollo app developer created a specific text-selection-mode for that. That's how anti-user the norms are on native apps compared to the web.Often, disabling selection on the web comes from trying to port native app norms to a web app.replyyowmamasita 5 hours ago

One of the biggest wins in my life that Emacs has granted me is the principle of never sacrificing plain text liberties. I could've probably achieved similar results using other tools, but the way Emacs puts you into that mindset is just on another level of awesome.Today, I can extract text from any tab in my browser to appear in an Emacs buffer. And it specifically "extracts" the text, it's not operating on the URL - meaning that I don't have to deal with auth, cookies, and other things, it just grabs the .outerHTML of an already rendered page - takes me not even a second. I can do whatever I want with that text - read it with far better readability features, feed it to an LLM, export into formats, grab some parts for my notes, etc.I can extract transcript from a YT video URL with a press of a key.Heck, I can even extract text from an image in my clipboard. That's what I do almost every day. My colleague would be showing me stuff through Zoom, I'd run Flameshot to grab a specific portion of the screen, and then run my elisp function - it OCRs the image and puts the results into a buffer.My advice to you folks: do not ever surrender to the status quo; keep the hacker's mindset; hack your way around computers. You have a finite amount of attention tokens, do not waste them getting angry at the upsetting design of web pages; extract what you need like a boss and move on.replyiefbr14 8 hours ago

They are too accustomed to macOS embedded OCR I presume.Or how would they share event details on social media. Rarely there is text description, mostly date and time is imprinted on image in Instagram.replymartin-adams 6 hours ago

The problem I face with building web apps where the elements are draggable or clickable, is that the browser also selects the text. The easiest solution is to disable text selection.But I’d love to know if there’s a better solution to keep text selection somehow.replysmelendez 5 hours ago

This is probably the issue in apps like Bumble—trying to keep the interface ultra simple and clean. Unfortunately the makers of apps like this are thinking in large numbers and not really considering issues like translation.It may also be to make it harder for users to slip in copy-and-paste references to material on other sites for spam or other purposes. Occasionally I'll see someone list an Instagram or Snapchat ID on a dating site, and they're often doing something at least semi-dodgy.Another issue might be reducing profile plagiarism.replypanzi 5 hours ago

On the web you can most of the time select text. You can at least inspect the element and copy the text that way. But in GUI programs very often you cant. There are these labels that cant be selected or copied. Especially frustrating for error messages. In e.g. KDE you actually can copy error messages! So that is great! I was told that under Windows you can do it simply by pressing Ctrl+C when the message box is open. That isn't very discoverable. Anyone know if that was always possible in Windows? Last I used was XP.Also reminds me of that Jonathan Blow video where he fights the Visual Studio debugger and can't copy a value.replymattvr 5 hours ago

Let's not forget the frustrations of an online system disabling the ability to select anything other than 'all' the text in a paragraph/text area/whatever.So many times I've needed simplify the data provided by an embed code or share link for some reason (usually a third party integration or API development), only to have found the site forcefully making me select way more than I ever needed to. It doesn't really change anything in the long run (since you can just copy it into any other text editor and get what you need there), but it's still an annoying extra step that shouldn't be needed nonetheless.replymc3301 1 hour ago

Hey, things have improved. Once in a while still I find a website that intercepts right click with an alert box: "This website's content is COPYRIGHTED!"On the other hand, making text unselectable in an app is more annoying. In a browser I can bore through the div soup to find the text element, but in an app it's just a big "fuck you."Halfway in between is an electron app like Spotify which, as far as I can see, disables text selection.replyrotis 4 hours ago

Reminds me of one of the stupidest hacks I discovered (In my mind). In one of my previous companies we had many similar Lotus Notes databases and one of them didn't allow to copy text from it. You could paste, I'm sure. You could select the text. But not copy. Turns out you could DRAG the selected text to other window. This copied the text over. So being able to highlight a text may mean you can indeed copy it ;)replymc3301 1 hour ago

On newer Android you can select any on-screen text with Google's Circle to Search. Long-press the navigation handle or Home button to open it, then circle, highlight, or tap the text. If it is not auto-selected, use Select text. You can copy, search, or translate directly without leaving the app. It also recognizes text inside images and screenshots, and Lens can even handle neat handwriting.

I too am a selector of text. I select text for many valid reasons. I have never selected text for an invalid reason.A lot of websites include (anti-)features that make it extremely difficult for me to read and this severely limits the amount that I interact with the site.
Features that hijack text selection in some way or preventing it entirely for whatever misguided reason are some of the worst offenders.
Yes, I realise that not everything is for me -- I am getting that message loud and clear.Preventing text selection is one of the most egregious and hostile ways to make your software unfriendly, but those insidious "share this quote" popout drawers are slowly fading in right behind it[0], hyperactively reflowing the layout and appending random snippets of selected text to the URL.Reading is the most basic, most fundamental way to interact with the web. It's fundamental to using software in general.

I know this is a bad answer, but. Web is a multi-stakeholder environment. Publishers and shitty content farms are stakeholders too. So they find a use for selection toggling in their dirty business and push for it.But in case of text selection toggling, it has likely appeared because of the need to make interactive elements non-inadvertently-selectable. Because complex UIs.replymarcosdumay 10 hours ago

All of those things have some niche use in an element here and there that allows for much better interaction in some kind of site.I'm honestly at a loss with unselectable text, but for example capturing the right mouse button is very useful for applications.Anyway, yes, it should be easy to turn those things off site-wide, like it's easy to zoom.replyzamadatix 7 hours ago

The one that comes to mind immediately is when you create a draggable element with text it's usually desirable for the user that click-drag moves the element rather than selects the text depending which part you click.Removing the attribute would probably make things worse, as site operators then overlay transparent elements - making everything even worse than when it was just styled as such.replyaartaka 4 hours ago

Because browsers and their operators, like any other industry, over time morph to a shareholder driven mess that needs to constantly be integrating with feature/product X.If the same operator also controls the entire adspace in the web, and has significant impact/input on other connected media devices beyond webbrowsers, what incentive do they have to empower users to "ignore" content, be it ads, ai slop, bad UI? Ther's literally none, the number still goes up revenue wise.Unavoidable content delivery attached to revenue generation is the present and the future and the only solution is disonnected services/products that aren't tied to dollars.replyaartaka 4 hours ago

Given that this page has the following styles which aren't applied anywhere else on the blog:

Yes but the joke is moot, because on the web, you can't really make text non-selectable (you can try, but it can be defeated extremely easily).In an app, undoing that is pretty much impossible (or at least, above my pay grade).This is one of a million reasons why apps are so bad.replytredre3 7 hours ago

> In an app, undoing that is pretty much impossible (or at least, above my pay grade).In my experience it is above the average user's pay grade to work around it in a browser too. Even power users will probably give up if the usual ways don't work out (holding alt, browser extension, reader mode). The power-est of users might glimpse at the inspector, but they'll give up if the nodes are obfuscated.All this to say that with things like Circle To Search or Apple's built-in screenshot OCR nowadays websites and apps are finally on a level playing field when it comes to anyone being able to circumvent text protection.replyNetMageSCW 1 hour ago

That’s probably one of those cases where they use two different statistics to assume a conclusion, e.g. maybe only 30% of students pass a particular profiency test, and then add to the fact that that test is the minimum level where fractions/percentages are expected to be known, and combine it to make a scary sounding headline.You might be right but, citation needed.replykulahan 6 hours ago

Specifically, for 12th-grade math, the cut scores are 141/300 for NAEP Basic, 176/300 for NAEP Proficient and 216/300 for NAEP Advanced. https://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/mathematics/achieve.as...The score is an aggregate over questions testing many different skills, so while getting a low score suggests that a student is less skilled, it doesn't immediately tell you which skills they're bad at in particular. So this is exactly the scenario that 'ninkendo was talking about. If you want to know how many students correctly answered a specific question testing a certain skill, you would need the raw disaggregated data, which I don't think NAGB publishes.I'd like to add that it's intentional that there are substantial numbers of students in each of the four buckets defined by the three thresholds, since the goal is to track the performance of the overall population, not just a few very bad or exceptionally good students.replykulahan 4 hours ago

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand the joke. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of CSS the joke will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also the author's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his post - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Chris Coyier's classic blogs, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of this joke, to realise that it's not just funny - it says something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who criticise being unable to select text within the blog post truly ARE idiots. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Bologov's genius wit unfolds itself in their browsers. What fools.. how I pity them.And yes, by the way, i DO have a tattoo of the Lobotomized Owl selector. And no, you cannot see it.

God I absolutely abhor "UI takeovers":Not allowing text selection, disabling scrolling where there should be scrolling, disabling autocomplete/text substitutions, or corrupting the Back/Forward buttons...Websites are guilty of this more often than apps, which usually just do whatever the device OS allows.Even worse are the outright LIES that even Apple has been guilty of for a while now:• Refreshing a webpage doesn't really refresh it. (it's less fresh than entering the URL in a new tab/window)• Going back doesn't really go back. (It loads the URL again..absolutely disgusting on YouTube when you want to go back to an interesting thumbnail you noticed too late, but it's not there anymore)• Force-quitting an app doesn't really quit it. (Now iOS still gives them a noticeable bit of time to ponder which is annoying when you open that app again right away)Not to mention the outright privacy and security violations like textboxes that send keystrokes home.replyaartaka 4 hours ago

Airbnb hosts that put textual descriptions with the address, and it only lets you copy the full text.
