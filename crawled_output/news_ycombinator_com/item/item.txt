Dear citizens of the EU:If this gets pushed through, you will gradually lose control of your government much like how the people of the UK already lost control of theirs.What are you going to do when the government's interests inevitably drift out of alignment with yours? Start a political movement? You will have the police knocking on your door for criticizing the establishment.Start a revolution? You have no weapons. You can't even organize a resistance because all channels of communication are monitored.You have neither the pen nor the sword. There is no longer an incentive for the government to serve you, and so it eventually won't.No amount of protest will recover the freedom you once had. You're heading towards a society where everyone feels oppressed but no one can do anything about it.replyJohnLocke4 4 hours ago

>You can't even organize a resistance because all channels of communication are monitored.One of the awful things about this proposed legislation is that what I quoted you saying is not true. Software like PGP is easy to use, and criminals already do. The government has absolutely no possibility of breaking RSA the way things are now, and as such scanning all messages will do nothing other than prove more definitively that criminals are still beyond their gavel. In reality, the only individuals who will get spied on are regular people who don't open their terminal just to send a text; exactly the people who should not be spied on in the first place.When the government realizes this invasive legislature is ineffective, they will probably crack down even harder. After all, what we are willing to accept from rulers has by the looks of it already increased dramatically. I wonder if it at some point it becomes illegal simply to posses encryption software on your personal devices, perhaps even possession of prime numbers that could theoretically be used in modern encryption. How far will the government go to take this illegal math from you?replymatheusmoreira 3 hours ago

> Software like PGP is easy to useCriminalize encryption. Oh you're using cryptograhy? Well then clearly you are a child molesting, money laundering, drug trafficking terrorist. No need to actually decrypt anything when cryptography is incriminating evidence unto itself.Computers are subversive. Cryptography alone can defeat police, judges, governments and militaries, and computers have democratized access to cryptography to the point even common citizens have it. They cannot tolerate it.It's a politico-technological arms race. They make their silly laws. We make technologies that completely nullify those laws. They need to increase their overall tyranny just to maintain the exact same level of control they had before. The end result is either an uncontrollable, ungovernable, unpoliceable population, or a totalitarian state that surveils, monitors and controls everything. There is no middle ground.We are rapidly advancing towards this totalitarianism, and we are eventually going to find out if the people have what it takes to resist and become ungovernable.One day we will need government signatures to run software on "our" computers. All the free software in the world won't help if we can't run it. The only way to resist that is to somehow develop the means to fabricate our own chips at home. Computer hardware fabrication must be made as easy as 3D printing random objects. Anything short of this and we're done for. Everything the word "hacker" stands for will be destroyed. Our privacy will be destroyed. Our freedom will be destroyed. It's over.replycoderenegade 24 minutes ago

Lazy.The US believes the right of the individual to harass others based on their immutable characteristics is more important than the right of the individual to be free of harassment based on their immutable characteristics.The UK doesn't, and that very much reflects UK vs US culture (US culture as we know being racist and divisive).Meanwhile, the US seems to be flirting with a central idea of communism and fascism - that political criticism of the dear leader is off limits.
Thus protecting the right of the (future) authoritarian (dictator) to be free of criticism.I know which one of two actually reflects an important aspect of freedom of speech.Rabble rousers will tell you otherwise, but the trick is to recognise they are rabble rousers.replytorified 2 hours ago

> Start a revolution? You have no weapons. (...) You have neither the pen nor the sword.We still have Euros. As long as enough companies and rich folk are more on our side than theirs, the government still has some incentive to serve us.I know, I know - money and politics, wealth and power, they go together at the high end. But there is the oft forgotten long tail, the rich and powerful at the scale of a city, a neighborhood, a niche market. Those tend to side with communities they live in, and in aggregate they still have plenty of pull with the rulers (which in stable times they use to block all kinds of potentially useful legislation, but still, good to have them come the hard times).Weapons won't matter all that much anyway, for several reasons:1) Life, especially in the EU, is not like in an American action movie;2) Citizens here may be significantly less armed, but the same is true of government officials, and even law enforcement is significantly less armed. It kind of evens out, unless military gets involved, but at that point all bets are off - no different than in the US.3) Firearms have a habit of magically appearing in bulk the moment a revolution starts. When it happens, it's a good indicator you should GTFO somewhere far away, as you're being played by whoever is supplying the weapons to your side.replybfg_9k 1 hour ago

It's already this dystopic, like any medium where people can talk freely gets eventually controlled by corrupt politicians etc.Anyways, the control of speech isn't only in surveillance, it's ingrained deeply in culture, taboos, education, etc.I have talked to religious people before, they all exhibited a certain characteristic, you could talk about somethings but you can't touch on other things, their mind won't accept it, so they bug and start saying nonsense.I've noticed the same thing with most people when it comes to certain subjects, you'd be talking to an educated person with a relatively high IQ and a mind that is capable to think critically in certain domains, yet once you point out something their mind has been trained to deem anti cultural (like for example who controls what), they turn into Agent Smith and they stop listening to reason.Anyways, this is HN so what I'm saying is that the control of the controllers is already absolute, it's been linearly increasing for years, they'd cause something then tighten their control of us for "our safety", until one day we get enough and some take out the guillotines and others the bald eagle etc. been happening for millenia, if we as a species were able to rebel on authority before s*it absolutely hit the fan, history would've been a lot cleaner.replytroupo 4 hours ago

From the article, the current flavor of "threat" this is being positioned to fight is CSAM.Does anyone believe that predators commit those heinous offenses because of the availability of encrypted channels to distribute those products of their crimes? I sure don't. The materials exist because of predators' access to children, which these surveillance measures won't solve.Best case scenario (and this is wildly optimistic) the offenders won't be able to find any 'safe' channels to distribute their materials to each other. The authorities really think every predator will just give up and stop abusing just because of that? What a joke.More likely of course, those criminals will just use decentralized tools that can't be suppressed or monitored, even as simple as plain old GPG and email. Therefore nothing of value will be gained from removing all privacy from all communication.replyblindriver 6 hours ago

> But politicians are - in general - neither evil, nor do they have any real incentive to ”control citizens’ thoughts”.As someone coming from authoritarian state, this is such an alien line of reasoning to me. By definition, those in power want more power. The more control over the people you have, the more power you get. Ergo, you always want more control.It's easy to overlook this if you've spent your entire life in a democratic country, as democracies have power dynamics that obscure this goal, making it less of a priority for politicians. For instance, attempting to seize too much power can backfire, giving political opponents leverage
against you. However, the closer a system drifts toward autocracy and the fewer constraints on power there are, the more achievable this goal becomes and the more likely politicians are to pursue it.Oh, and also politics selects for psychopaths who are known for their desire for control.replypalata 4 hours ago

> I’m sure it’s not even deliberately dismantling privacy.But it is not even dismantling privacy. ChatControl would run client-side and only report what's deemed illegal. Almost all communications are legal, and almost all of the legal communications wouldn't be reported to anyone at all. They would stay private.The problem I see is that the "client-side scanner" has to be opaque to some extent: it's fundamentally impossible to have an open source list of illegal material without sharing the illegal material itself. Meaning that whoever controls that list can abuse it. E.g. by making the scanner report political opponents.This is a real risk, and the reason I am against ChatControl.But it isn't dismantling privacy per se.EDIT: I find it amazing how much I can be downvoted for saying that I am against ChatControl, but that argument X or Y against it is invalid. Do we want an echo chamber to complain about the principle, or do we want to talk about what is actually wrong with ChatControl?It's nice to say "those politicians are morons who don't understand how it works", but one should be careful to understand it themselves.replystephen_g 58 minutes ago

It's a mechanism where the Governments give lists of un-auditable hashes to chat operators and force them to send the content of messages to them when they match.You can't for a second imagine how that could possibly go wrong?The hashes are "only for what's deemed illegal" because just trust me bro. There won't be any false-positives because just trust me bro. Even if you do believe the Governments are fully trustworthy and don't care about false positives of your own personal images or messages being passed around law enforcement, most systems like this have usually also eventually been compromised by other parties (like CALEA which was used by China and other adversaries for years). Even if you fully trust the Government, we can't actually be sure the un-auditable list of hashes are only from them, or whether adversaries have compromised the system to add their own hashes. And we don't know that the mechanism that sends our private messages (from a real match, or a false-positive, or an adversarial added hash) are only going to authorised parties or if somebody else has managed to add themselves in (like has happened with "lawful intercept" systems in the past).So even when claiming it's only for combating the most heinous crimes, the system is too dangerous.replypalata 6 hours ago

Sounds like a non-sequitur to me. Yes, this is how it works - in every aspect of life we try to regulate as a society (through laws and enforcement). Criminal activities are prohibited, restricted and monitored. Criminals move on, but the law is also adaptive and soon catches on.

No,the logical conclusion is that, on the contrary, liberal democracies end up as authoritarian legalist regimes, as they progressively need more and more laws and enforcement to catch criminals who evade them.You can see this clearly with the constant inflation of AML laws in the EU, which become more and more restrictive and invasive each year, without any clear effect.replyatoav 5 hours ago

> if you can read all communicationsBut you can't. You can legally require messages to implement client side scanning before the encryption happens or add some backdoor keys and hope they don't leak.Since cryptography is known anybody can always just create messengers that just don't implement that requirement. If you sexually abuse children the hurdle to illegally running a non-backdoored messenger seems pretty low to me.Thats like fighting illegal street races by implementing electronically-GPS-enforced tempolimits for everybody.

But I am amazed by all the bullshit arguments that people find to criticise ChatControl.If you have more control, obviously it's easier to track criminals. That's not the question at all.

So ChatControl means that e.g. Signal would be obligated to automatically scan pictures and messages sent for CSAM. This is beyond encryption. And if they were to actually do that, it would mean it's non sensical for people spreading this material to use it as they would immediately be caught, so they would just use other tools.But people are talking about both - the ridiculousness of the premise that this would help combat this and additionally of course the cost of privacy.It's beyond encryption.

But yet, most USA jurisdictions say that 16y can have sex.

Well, maybe the word "plausible" is doing too much work in my statement.Most abuse happens from people known to the child, and of that portion, most are family members.
It seems like there is sufficient opportunity in-person comms to route around this limitation.Moreover, even the communications that do happen online can still easily happen through encrypted media; presumably the perpetrators will simply move to other ways of communicating.
And kids, at least kids over 10 or so, don't seem like a demographic particularly likely to follow this law anyhow.There's another nuance worth considering: by and large, parents _want_ their kids to have access to encrypted communications.
I'll happily assist my kiddo in maintaining good opsec - that's much more important to me than some silly and uninformed policy decision being made far away by people I've never met.https://web.archive.org/web/20210522003136/https://blog.nucy...So, the kids are still going to be where the encrypted comms are.

For me the problem is that I see a potential for abuse with the "list" (whether it's a list or a sum of weights) of illegal material. This list cannot be made public (because it's highly illegal material), so it's hard to audit. So whoever has control over it can abuse it, e.g. to find political opponents.

No, you don’t get it. Hosting or possessing CSAM has criminal penalties even if no children were involved. For example AI generated imagery.In fact, even if zero children are ever trafficked or abused going forward, and pedophiles only use old photos of children from 30 years ago, merely having these images is still an issue.Conversely, the vast majority of sexual abuse of minors doesn’t involve images and goes unreported. "Considerable evidence exists to show that at least 20% of American women and 5% to 10% of American men experienced some form of sexual abuse as children" (Finkelhor, 1994). "Most sexual abuse is committed by men (90%) and by persons known to the child (70% to 90%), with family members constituting one-third to one-half of the perpetrators against girls and 10% to 20% of the perpetrators against boys" (Finkelhor, 1994).In short - if they wanted to reduce child abuse, scanning everyone’s communications for CSAM would not be the most straightforward way to go about it.replylukan 6 hours ago

Exactly. Econ 101: why do consumption taxes work at all? By increasing the amount of pain associated with purchasing a particular indulgent product, you decrease the consumption of that product on the margin. When you increase the price of cigarettes by 20%, cigarette smoking in a society decreases. But for the most addicted, no consumption tax will probably act as a deterrent.Some individuals will find a way to distribute and consume child pornography no matter the cost. But other addicted individuals will stop consuming if doing so becomes so laborious because they are consuming or distributing on the margin. I.e, imagine the individual who doesn't want to be consuming it, who knows they shouldn't—this type of deterrent may be the breaking point that gets them to stop altogether. And if you reduce the amount of consumption or production by any measure, you decrease a hell of a lot of suffering.But anyway, the goal of this legislation is not to drive the level of distribution to 0. The goal of policymakers could be seen charitably as an attempt to curtail consumption, because any reduction in consumption is a good thing.replydelis-thumbs-7e 6 hours ago

I think of constitution as a contract between the citizens and the state and the (judiciary?)Like, constitution both defines the rights of citizens and the limits of those rights and the same goes for the states.I feel as if the creators of constitutions think that it is a set of checks and balances...Just as if how a citizen violates something written in the constitution, the state can punish it.In the same manner, I believe that the constitution thought that if the state violates some constitutional right of citizen, then citizens can point that out and (punish?) the state as the legitimacy of state is through that constitution which they might be breaking...I concur (fancy word for believe which I wanted to share lol) you are talking about america. The thing is, revolutions are often messy and so much things are happening in america that I think that people are just overwhelmed and have even forgotten all the stuff happening in the past... Like tarrifs were huge thing, then epstein news then this I think autism thing by trump.Like, the amount of political discourse is happening less and idk, oh shit, just remembered the uh person deporting thing which was illegal which was done anywayIf these things happened in isolation, they would all have huge actions against govt. but they are happening back to back and so everyone's just kinda silent I think, frankly I believe overwhelmed.I believe that just as in nepal, in america everyone is whining on social media but nobody's taking action.

> This year has been a devastating blow to my confidence in our democracy and the ability of people to govern themselves generally.The latter has been on my mind for quite some time.The logical conclusion of "people can't govern themselves generally" kind of gestures at religion as a solution - after all, if man cannot govern themselves, why not rely on a higher power to manage them?Of course, the problem with that point of view is that from the atheistic perspective, there is no higher power, and from the agnostic perspective, whatever higher power there is is inscrutable and beyond our ken.This then leads me to the conclusion that religion is ultimately a creation of men, and are thus prone to the same power-corrupting vices as any other institution created by men.Except that leaves no real solution the problem of the governance of people.
And it's a quandary I see no realistic chance of escape from.replyImustaskforhelp 3 hours ago

I agree to the same thing to a somewhat degree from another standpoint / a discussion worth tapping into.Its not that the logical conclusion is "people can't govern themselves generally"Its that, we have created a system which incentivizes corruption or basically evil things for the most part from TOP TO BOTTOM partially influenced by biological factors beyond our control.Sure, one answer to the "people can't govern themselves generally" is to decentralize the power.I live in India and I loathed my political system thinking that it wasn't good and I really appreciated american political system but the more I think about it, fundamentally Indian political system is one of the best actually.It has 3 levels of decentralization with Strong Right to information and uh multi party system with Even Universal basic income which I came to know from an american which is a real shocker I know.Yet I still see people begging and there being some chaos, My logical answer to it is corruption from TOP TO BOTTOM which I observed atleast.I sort of believe that the same thing happens everywhere to be honest if that can make sense...Like, there is corruption and human evils which is what people select in real life anonymous things as compared to true morality that one can reason through. Simply for one's own profit.It also might be one of those debates that India might have a good political system but simply the people don't have enough money or something and they want more or everyone does it which is a common answer that I actually hear.I believe that the reason why people can't govern themselves generally is that there is a biological answer to it in the sense that for people to govern themselves, we would prefer /need an altruist society and in an altruist society, and how the genes which favour a bit of evil in altruist society might reproduce more and spread sort of thus creating an equilibra of sorts and combining with that the idea on how interlinked/interinfluential each of us is to one other through language.It was a catharsis to me, The answer might be depressing. But its fundamentally logic. Life just sort of happened and then it got way too focused on spreading itself / the one which did survived and boom that's biology which then gets to this political thing...Like it was sort of meant to happen y'know? atleast that's my current understanding of it.

> As an American, it came as a surprise to me that we do not, in fact, have broadly shared values about our system of governance.It shouldn't, America is two very distinct nations. The shape and nature of those nations vary wildly in classical Baudrilliardian sidewinding progression, but it's rooted in the very early history of British North America. Two distinct primogenitor colonies and societies, Jamestown and Plymouth. Founded for different reasons, in different contexts, by different people. Understanding the disparity is key to understanding a great deal about America. This divide has always persisted. Jefferson was of Tidewater, Hamilton was of Yankeedom. Democrats vs Whigs. Dixie vs Yankeedom. This split persists in history, and is much the reason why America is ostensibly a two party system. Even if the regional divide is not as hard and fast as it once was, even if the matters in which they differ change radically over time, the divide itself will always persist. It's wrapped up in the pre-revolutionary context the country was founded on. America will always be two countries in a trenchcoat, two echoes of wildly different cultures set against each other for dominance. You should always be keen to remember that.

Not to mention that, as written, it appears to make it illegal for me to tell you that you cannot come to my house with a gun, because that's me infringing your right. It doesn't constrain Congress. It constrained anyone who wants to take away your right to bear arms.Sheer lunacy as written. Ungrammatical and implies some insane shit.But no, you're right, it's crystal clear.

X -> [grammar rules 18th century] -> 2nd amendment -> [grammar rules 21th century] -> ...
, then when you want to discuss meaning issues due to grammar rules, you need to use 18th century grammar.
I perceived GLdRH to use 21th century grammar to encode the same sentence.
The literal text does not need to be modified, since it uses 18th century grammar rules.
Only when you want to parse it with 21th century grammar rules, you need to preprocess it to adjust the grammar first.
This preprocessing doesn't need to be written back, since the grammar rules of the text haven't changed.
We are only circumventing the parser not supporting the texts grammar.> only the Supreme Court's opinion matters.This is purely about syntactic issues, not about semantics.
The Supreme Court applies also semantics, such as the other legal system definitions of the time.

How so? My point is that US constitutional protections on firearm ownership have undeniably eroded. The presence of text on the page did not prevent this erosion. I'm using gun rights as an example of a situation in which text granting a right becomes irrelevant if people stop believing in the values behind the text.People do believe in freedom of speech in the US, thankfully, even if they've stopped defending gun rights in some places.EU free speech protections are in the same position gun rights are in the US, and for surprisingly similar reasons.replyAloisius 7 hours ago

This simply isn't true. If anything, constitutional protections have dramatically expanded since the amendment was passed.This is because until the 14th Amendment and the incorporation doctrine, the Bill of Rights only restricted the Federal government, not the States. Prior to the that, state and local governments could (and did) restrict not just firearms, but other rights as well.Hell, the Bill of Rights still hasn't been fully incorporated, so for instance, despite the 7th Amendment stating otherwise, you don't have the right to a jury trial in civil cases in every state nor the right to indictment by grand jury (5th Amendment).Of course, some states copied parts of the constitution into their own and had some form of protection, but it was by no means universal.

I've commented this elsewhere, but rights in the US are generally much more absolute than here in Europe.For example, in the EU you technically have the right to freedom of expression, but you can also be arrested if you say something that could offend someone.Similarly rights to privacy are often ignored whenever a justification can be made that it's appropriate to do so.I don't know about elsewhere in the world, but here in the UK you don't even have a right to remain silent because the government added a loophole so that if you're arrested in a UK airport they can arbitrarily force you to answer their questions and provide passwords for any private devices.

But in this case, the U.S. (or rather, U.S. organisations and corporations) might be the primary bad actor pushing for ChatControl. See e.g.:Thorn (organization) - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorn_(organization)"Thorn works with a group of technology partners who serve the organization as members of the Technology Task Force. The goal of the program includes developing technological barriers and initiatives to ensure the safety of children online and deter sexual predators on the Internet. Various corporate members of the task force include Facebook, Google, Irdeto, Microsoft, Mozilla, Palantir, Salesforce Foundation, Symantec, and Twitter.[7] ... Netzpolitik.org and the investigative platform Follow the Money criticize that "Thorn has blurred the line between advocacy for children’s rights and its own interest as a vendor of scanning software."[11][12] The possible conflict of interest has also been picked up by Balkan Insight,[13] Le Monde,[14] and El Diario.[15] A documentary by the German public-service television broadcaster ZDF criticizes Thorn’s influence on the legislative process of the European Union for a law from which Thorn would profit financially.[16][17] A move of a former member of Europol to Thorn has been found to be maladministration by the European Ombudsman Emily O'Reilly.[18][19]"Additionally, it would not surprise me at all if Palantir is lobbying for this either. Many EU countries, like Germany and Denmark, have already integrated Palantir's software into the intelligence, defence, and policing arms of their governments.But at the end of the day, while it is convenient to blame external actors like U.S. corporations, ultimately the blame lies solely on the shoulders of European politicians. People in positions of power will tend to seek more, and I'm sure European politicians are more than happy to wield these tools for their own gain regardless of whether Palantir or Thorn is lobbying them.replynaijaboiler 8 hours ago

I would argue that a surefire way of guaranteeing the right to privacy is to instead continuously push for absolute-transparency laws for politicians and governments. If they’re going to demand every private citizen’s records are always open for view, then the same should be said for governments - no security clearances, no redactions, no “National Security” excuse.Is it patently unreasonable? Yes, but cloaked in the “combat corruption” excuse it can be just as effective in a highly-partisan society such as this - just like their “bUt WhAt AbOuT tHe ChIlDrEn” bullshit props up their demands for global surveillance.replygmuslera 9 hours ago

Sometimes authoritarianism is the same as populism.Rwanda: Prior to the genocide, the government systematically distributed weapons to local administrators and militia groups while ensuring targeted populations remained defenseless.Myanmar: Armed civilian resistance groups formed, but the were essentially wiped out by the overwhelming advantages in air power and heavy weaponry that an actual organized military had. The firearms were useless. Arguably, worse than useless as those who fought back died in large numbers.Venezuela: The regime armed its supporters while systematically removing weapons from the general population.

Algeria's war of independence from France in the 1950s and early 1960s is another example where a group with very little in the way of military capability defeated one of the most powerful militaries in the world.I don't necessarily buy the argument that the US should continue with the gun status quo just because all those guns would come in handy in a revolution, but you haven't successfully refuted the argument.replymapontosevenths 4 hours ago

I doubt the ALN could have succeeded in those encounters even one tenth as often as they actually did if they had no access or much worse access to guns (with "success" meaning inflicting casualties on the occupier, avoiding taking casualties, capturing supplies (including guns) and disrupting the occupier's control).There is a reason people say, "don't bring a knife to a gun fight".The ALN got guns from donors and sympathizers in Egypt and other Arab countries. In later years, the Eastern Bloc and China also contributed supplies, including guns.Was there a single significant war, rebellion or revolution in the last 100 years where both sides didn't have a gun for every fighter or almost that many guns?

I regularly see similar articles with similar comments here, but there's one thing I still don't understand:From the European Convention on Human Rights[1]:
ARTICLE 8
Right to respect for private and family life
1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family
life, his home and his correspondence.
2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the
exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the
law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of
national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the
country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection
of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms
of others.
So I wonder, what is the legal argument solid enough to justify interfering with everybody's right to privacy?My layman understanding of the usual process is like, we want surveillance over those people and if it seems reasonable a judge might say ok but for a limited time. Watching everyone's communications also seems at odds with the principle of proportionality[2].[1]https://www.echr.coe.int/documents/d/echr/Convention_ENG[2]https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:12...replypalata 4 hours ago

The scanning is done locally. Nobody would say that your OS is "watching your communications", right? Even though the OS has to "read" your messages in order to print them on your screen.Note that I am against ChatControl. My problem with it is that the list of illegal material (or the "weights" of the model deciding what is illegal) cannot be audited easily (it won't be published as it is illegal material) and can be abused by whoever has control over it.replypests 3 hours ago

A third-party controlling the local scan of all my data specifically to report whatever it wants is a huge problem.Too often are some specific issues left insufficiently addressed for too long and it seems like the answer ends up like, ok we give up, here's some collective punishment, that should do the trick.replypalata 3 hours ago

So whoever controls that list could abuse it.I see lot of weird arguments like "it's breaking encryption" and "it's destroying democracies". It's wrong. The problem is that it may be abused if your democracy doesn't work as well as it should. And it's good enough an argument to be against ChatControl.My whole point is that it's not constructive to throw baseless complaints at ChatControl: there is a valid argument against it (still looking for more), and we need to use it.replyniels8472 5 hours ago

Imagine a future where it becomes easier to commit terrorism because of some technological advancements—like smaller, less traceable bombs, or chemical weapons that are easily accessible and lead to higher casualties—like in the 1,000s or more. Imagine in that scenario, that the likelihood of you or someone you know becoming the victim of a terrorist attack is now non-trivial in your society. In a future where this becomes the norm, it would be interesting to see if individuals are more willing to adopt a level of increased surveillance as it seems like the only reasonable protection against terror.Right now this debate is oriented mostly around the fact that surveillance today is not a good deal—consumers give up their privacy and get nothing in return. But is there a tipping point? Technology draws us closer, day by day, and the threat matrix will become more sophisticated as time moves forward.Most individuals on HN are privacy absolutists but one should recognize that tradeoffs exist. That tradeoff is just not compelling today, but that doesn't mean that will always be the case. If you go to China, where everything and everyone is surveilled, I think you'd be surprised to find that many Chinese don't mind. They feel incredibly safe and don't have to worry about being victims of crimes, having their packages stolen, walking around late at night alone, etc. Walking around in China with absolute peace of mind around my own personal safety is a very eye-opening experience as someone coming from the US. I've always advocated for stringent privacy protections; but when giving
that up buys you absolute safety in your immediate environment, that's not an experience you forget.I'm certainly not saying I'm a proponent of living in a surveillance state—I'm simply noting that tradeoffs exist and a sort of re-balancing is constantly occurring, which is just interesting to be aware of.replymatthewdgreen 7 hours ago

I don’t know if it’s complete fearmongering to imagine a scenario in the future where chemical or biological weapons are easier to manufacture and therefore execute attacks. Hundreds of people died in Europe last year due to terrorist attacks, and compared to where our species will eventually be, many of the technologies used in these attacks are still in their infancy. The world may evolve, but the scriptures that evangelize future jihadists won’t, so the incentive to be a martyr will always exist. I just looked it up and Europe has a very bad track record at stopping attacks—of 54 planned terrorist attacks in 2024 only 19 were averted by intelligence. 35 were carried out successfully. The threat may come from factions other than just jihadists in the future, too. I agree that this is not something we have to worry about now, which is why I stated that I’m hypothesizing in the original comment. But I think it’s a bit less far fetched than a near term alien invasion :-)replyannoyingnoob 6 hours ago

Sorta yes and sorta no? You're factually correct; but practically missing the point a little bit. At my relative's place, which has many tall buildings around a hub, package delivery people leave all of the resident's packages on a very exposed and busy sidewalk. People walk by these packages all day and none of them are ever stolen. Could you imagine an Amazon delivery driver just leaving all of the packages for the Flatiron building on the sidewalk in NYC? It'd be a perverse Monty Python skit because the packages would all disappear before the delivery driver even left the area.This sort of shared expectation of courtesy and safety is more common there; and it exists because of the surveillance state. I'm not advocating to live in a surveillance state; they're oppressive—the cons certainly outweigh the pros. There's no debating that. But the silver lining in that is borne of that cost is one that I think people there enjoy.replysuperxpro12 6 hours ago

It's not about the usefulness... it's that omnipotent surveillance creates a jarring imbalance of power between the surveillance state and the people.If the employees of the state were subject to the same exact surveillance, then maybe it might be palatable.Curiously, the Star Trek Universe exists in such a scenario. A common trope is asking the computer for evidence of a crime, where someone is at any time, etc. I've never heard complaints about this supposed contradiction between the utopia vision of Star Trek and the omnipotent, all-seeing computer.But we all know the reality... a tale as old as time. The state will exclude themselves from the surveillance, and it will eventually be used as a tool for authoritarianism.

If they were, it would actually be better: one can have sympathy for insanity, and at least isolate it, if not treat it.Instead, it's extreme insecurity combined with limitless regard for infallible authority.
The thought that the hoi polloi might write or say things that are beyond scrutiny is intolerable.
That's the insecurity part.
And all intolerable things must be criminalized, because in Europe, laws infallibly fix everything.
That's the authority part.That's not insanity.

I don't think ChatControl is a good idea. I also think that if you want to convince people of that, using the same misleading language tactics as the other side is not the way to go.> These scanning systems get it wrong most of the time. [...] Irish law enforcement confirms this: only 20.3% of 4,192 automated reports actually contained illegal material.Wrong most of the time that they report something. Technically correct, although a somewhat tricky formulation.Literally next paragraph:> Even with hypothetical 99% accuracy (which current systems don’t achieve), scanning billions of daily messages would generate millions of false accusations.This is a different accuracy percentage: here the author means 99% of all messages, not only the reported ones, which the previous 20.3% referred to. Furthermore, these two paragraphs together sound very fishy: if current systems are not accurate enough to generate "millions of false accusations", presumably (?) they generate at least that. But with the 20.3% true positives fraction, that would mean hundreds of thousands true accusations per day.Which part am I misunderstanding?replyrandomNumber7 9 hours ago

The people who are trying to install this kind of law basically do!They want to change the public perception from "Private encrypted communication is good and desirable" to "Encrypted is unsafe. Encrypted could be scary. Encrypted enables Bad People."In a vain attempt to inhibit access to non-broken cryptography, we will probably see operating systems that allow actual root access to the user -- or even just allowing non-manufacturer-signed executables to run! -- being painted as "unsafe platforms." Apple has already transitioned most of the way to being fully in the "trusted computing" camp, since it takes a great deal of gymnastics to even modify the OS because of the Mac's sealed system volume, and out of the box all executables must be blessed by Apple, meaning governments can put their thumb on Apple to force them to disallow any non-broken crypto tools from being used. I know this can be changed in Settings for now, but that'll probably go away eventually.Microsoft will be next of course, and Linux will be portrayed as a "hacking tool" by contrast to the commercial OSs.replyizacus 2 hours ago

Why downvote? Because the terrorists wear suits, speak in committees, are mostly white, and there’s no blood on the floor (yet)? The method is different, but the aim is the same: intimidation and control of a population for political ends.If terrorism is defined as using violence or threats to intimidate a population for political or ideological ends, then “Chat Control” qualifies in substance.Violence doesn’t have to leave blood. Psychological and coercive violence is recognised in domestic law (see coercive control offences) and by the WHO. It causes measurable harm to bodies and minds.The aim is intimidation. The whole purpose is to make people too scared to speak freely. That is intimidation of a population, by design.It is ideological. The ideology is mass control - keeping people compliant by stripping them of private spaces to think, talk, and dissent.The only reason it’s not “terrorism” on paper is because states write definitions that exempt themselves. But in plain terms, the act is indistinguishable in effect from terrorism: deliberate fear, coercion, and the destruction of free will.You can argue legality if you like, but the substance matches the textbook definition.replybaalimago 7 hours ago

I don't see how they can come after anyone who's using a specific protocol [0] by law. Expanding on this thought: if Chat Control passes, it will just be the death of social media as a chat platform. People will swap to something more rudimentary where it can't be enforced. Primary reason why being that it simply will be so much faster/more convenient than the apps which are forced to use chat control.The same reason as why streaming services are being ditched in favor of piracy will happen to social media.[0]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRCreplytdiff 6 hours ago

Most arguments I see against ChatControl sound like bullshit to me. How do we expect to convince anyone to go against ChatControl with those?I feel unease when it comes to ChatControl; I don't want my devices to run proprietary, opaque algorithms on all my data. And it feels like it fundamentally has to be opaque: nobody can't publish an open source list of illegal material together with their hash (precisely because it is illegal). That is why I don't want ChatControl: I would want someone to formally prove that it cannot be abused, just because of what it means. The classic example being: what happens if someone in power decides to use this system to track their opponents?But most comments and most articles talk about anything but that, with honestly weird, unsupported claims:> It's the end of encryptionHow so? What appears on my screen is not encrypted and will never be encrypted, because I need to read it. We all decrypt our messages to read them, and we all write them unencrypted before we send them.> It won't fight CSAMWho are you kidding? Of course it will. It will not solve the problem entirely, but it will be pretty damn efficient at detecting CSAM when CSAM is present in the data being scanned.> With ChatControl, every message gets automatically checked, assuming everyone is guilty until proven innocent and effectively reversing the presumption of innocence.When you board a plane, you're searched. When you enter a concert hall, you're search. Nobody would say "you should let me board the plane with whatever I put in my bag, because I'm presumed innocent".> While your messages still get encrypted during transmission, the system defeats the purpose of end-to-end encryption by examining your content before it gets encrypted.Before it gets encrypted, it is not encrypted. So the system is not breaking the encryption. If (and that's a big if) this system was open source, such that anyone could check what code it is running and prove that the system is not being abused, then it would be perfectly fine. The problem is that we cannot know what the system does. But that's a different point (and one of the only valid arguments against ChatControl).> Proton point out this approach might be worse than encryption backdoors. Backdoors give authorities access to communications you share with others. This system examines everything on your device, whether you share it or not.How is it worse? Backdoors give access to communications, this system (on the paper) does not. This system is better, unless we admit that we can't easily audit what the system is doing exactly. Which again is the one valid argument against ChatControl.> The regulation also pushes for mandatory age verification systems. No viable, privacy-respecting age verification technology currently exists. These systems would eliminate online anonymity, requiring users to prove their identity to access digital services.This is plain wrong. There are ways to do age verification anonymously, period.> Police resources would be overwhelmed investigating innocent families sharing vacation photos while real crimes go uninvestigated.How to say you don't know how the police works without saying you don't know how the police works? Anyway, that's the problem of the police.> Google’s algorithms flagged this legitimate medical consultation as potential abuse, permanently closed his account and refused all appeals.The problem is the closing and refusing of appeals.> The letter emphasizes that client-side scanning cannot distinguish between legal and illegal content without fundamentally breaking encryption and creating vulnerabilities that malicious actors can exploit.Then explain how? How is it fundamentally breaking encryption and creating vulnerabilities? Stop using bad arguments. If you have actual reasons to go against ChatControl, talk about those. You won't win with the bullshit, invalid arguments.> ChatControl catches only amateur criminals who directly attach problematic content to messages.Yep, that's an argument in favour of ChatControl: it does catch some criminals. How many criminals are professionals? Do you want to make it legal to be an amateur criminal?Don't get me wrong: I am against ChatControl. Because of one argument I believe to be valid: we fundamentally cannot know what the algorithm doing the scanning is doing, so those who control it could abuse it. Of all the discussions I have seen against ChatControl, I haven't seen another valid argument. But this one is enough.Stop saying bullshit, start using the valid arguments.

It also needs to be possible (for the average user as well) to stop it from doing reprehensible things. If a client-side scanning algorithm is actually searching for e. g. political content, it is possible to detect it via reverse engineering, but merely knowing it won't solve the problem, but instead lead into self-censorship.replydaemin 9 hours ago

I was just thinking that if something like this ever does get through and become law, then creating open-source alternatives which do not obey these laws would be quite trivial. What would not be trivial would be deciding where to host the servers and source code, and how to actually get this software onto people's devices.What country would be safe for hosting code that does this that people would also trust in general? Would this be hosted on the dark web or would someone actually be brave enough to host it on their private machines? Would there be DNS that could point to this?Then how would you install the software? You'd need a way to side-load it, which means you'd want a way to sign it. Which means either adding a new root signing authority or being able to have an existing root authority sell you a signing certificate and not revoke it.You kind of quickly end up in some weird dystopian cyberpunk setting thinking all of this through.replywalterbell 9 hours ago
