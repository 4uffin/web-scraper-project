https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ssd-inst...Not all AWS instance types support NVMe drives. It's not the same as normal attached storage.I'm not really sure your arguments are in good faith here tho.This is just not a configuration you can trivially do while maintaining durability and HA.There's a lot of hype going the exact opposite direction and more separation of storage and compute. This is our counter to that. We think even EBS is bad.This isn't a setup that is naturally just going to beat a "real server" that also has local NVMes or whatever you'd do yourself. This is just not what things like RDS or Aurora do, etc. Most things rely on EBS which is significantly worse than local storages. We aren't really claiming we've invented something new here. It's just unique in the managed database space.Onavo 0 minutes ago

I am not sure why they even bother...they are at the top of their fields and the professional organizations should be naming prizes after them instead of them begging to be part of the in-group. You don't see Bill Gates, Jobs, or Torvalds begging to join the IEEE.danpalmer 1 minute ago

Great to hear. I'll never forget running into Teller in the lobby of a small show I went to that he was also in the audience for. I sheepishly asked for an autograph and he was very friendly and gracious (and spoke!).ModernMech 1 minute ago

> But since the entire world economy has turned to purely optimizing for control and profit, there's just no good reason to not screw people over as much and as often as possible, what'll they do ?I worked on a somewhat well-known (at the time) product that used on-site hosting.One of our biggest customer complaints was that we didn’t have a cloud hosted option. Many companies didn’t want to self-host. They’d happily pay a premium to not have to host it.I think HN underestimates the demand for cloud hosted solutions. Companies don’t want to deal with self-hosted if they can pay someone else a monthly fee to do it.corytheboyd 1 minute ago

Honestly I don’t know how to feel about it anymore, but I found the rhetoric way too explosive at the time, when nothing was really known. Now that some time has passed, and more has been said… yeah I get your point too.Ruby has been a HUGE part of building my career, I don’t want to see it slide away one questionable move at a time into full corporate control. It’s not TOO hard to see how this whole thing could just be step one of that :/lebuffon 2 minutes ago

on: Easy Forth (2015)
The hard part I think is grokking the fact that the FORTH can compile and interpret inside the same definition. Also one must understand the operation of the Forth primitives HERE and comma (,)I will take a run at explaining IF ENDIF
(endif is the Fig Forth term, used here to avoid confusion)?BRANCH is an instruction in the virtual machine. It jumps if top of stack=0 .
The offset (or address)that it jumps to is the memory word right after the ?BRANCH token. Like this:
<?BRANCH><number>Forth definition of IF: IF
COMPILE ?BRANCH
HERE 0 , ;
IMMEDIATEAt compile time IF "compiles" the token for ?BRANCH but then interprets "HERE 0 ,"(IF is an IMMEDIATE word that executes even if the compiler is turned on)HERE is like $ in Assembler, ie: the address where code is being laid down.
It is simply left on the data stack. HERE is the address where the <number> will be stored... later.0 is a zero, that is pushed onto the data stack."Comma" (,)
pops the zero and puts it in memory address HERE but! it advances the system memory pointer 1 integer width.The zero is now a place holder in memory to be filled in by ENDIF.: ENDIF( addr -- )
HERE OVER - SWAP ! ; IMMEDIATEENDIF needs that address left behind by IF shown in comment as addr.
ENDIF gets the new value of HERE which of course is different because we will have compiled some code after the IF keyword.All we need to do is do
NEWHERE-OLDHERE to get the offset for ?BRANCH.
That is covered by the forth code ( oldhere-on-stack) HERE OVER -
This will make the data stack be:
( OLDHERE offset )If we do a SWAP we just need the store operator '!' to put the offset into memory.For the morbidly curious here is the definition of ELSE.
:-): ELSE
COMPILE BRANCH
HERE 0 , SWAP [COMPILE] ENDIF ; IMMEDIATESo loops are just more of the same...
(all loops jump back to BEGIN. BRANCH is an unconditional jump instruction)
```
: BEGIN
HERE ;
IMMEDIATE: AGAIN
COMPILE BRANCH
HERE - , ;
IMMEDIATE: UNTIL
COMPILE ?BRANCH HERE - ,
;
IMMEDIATE: WHILE
[COMPILE] IF SWAP ;
IMMEDIATE: REPEAT
[COMPILE] AGAIN [COMPILE] ENDIF ; IMMEDIATE

Even if you never want to practice magic, I highly recommend buying a few Dani DaOrtiz lectures. The way his mind works is phenomenal, and the things he talks about (psychology, how people think, experiences) is applicable across the board.(I don't really perform many of his tricks... they're brilliant, but they're so perfectly suited for his style that I can't even come close to pulling them off without seeming like a confusing idiot. This specific trick is available on Vanishing.)digdugdirk 2 minutes ago

There is also no direct evidence that smoking causes lung cancer. There are no randomized controlled trials to establishing smoking is the cause. Nor could we ever feasibly run one. All we know is there is very strongly correlation.naasking 3 minutes ago

on: The Magic Circle inducts Penn and Teller
My favorite episode had a magician do a great act about reading the paper, and all these terrible things spilled out and then he closed it, reopened it and good things spilled out. Penn and Teller of course recognized a zombie and a twilight seance but went out of their way to say how moving and entertaining they found the act.iambateman 4 minutes ago

on: Dear GitHub: no YAML anchors, please
That looks so terrible, but they could have been so easily transformed into an S-expression language similar to Lisp:
(if (equals foo "bar")
(then (echo "The value of property foo is 'bar'"))
(elseif (equals foo "foo")
(then (echo "The value of property foo is 'bar'")))
(else (echo "The value of property foo is not 'foo' or 'bar'")))
That’s not a Lisp-like language I particularly like, but it’s not flat-out insane like Ant appears to be.Advocates for the inappropriate use of XML (basically, anywhere it was used as anything other than a markup language) have lot to answer for.quotemstr 4 minutes ago

Not relicensing at all, just simply adhering to a spec, as the GNU tools do. Can we get down from the soap box now on rewrites? People are free to reimplement anything if there’s a spec and no law against it. Derivative works only works when there is no public record of a specification prior to an IP introducing it. A copyright. IANAL but I’m pretty sure that’s how that works.If you can prove they copied code, sure, it’s derivative. If you can prove they started from a fork, maybe you have a case. Starting from scratch is about as this is new as it gets.29athrowaway 4 minutes ago
