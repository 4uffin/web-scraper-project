on: Tracing JITs in the Real World CPython Core Dev Sp...
I wonder how much Julia’s JIT could help inform Python’s. [Diagram](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/devdocs/img/compiler_diagra...) from [the docs](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/devdocs/eval/) From what I understand, Julia doesn’t do any tracing at all, it just compiles each function based on the types it receives. Obviously Python doesn’t have multiple dispatch, but that actually might make compilation easier. Swap out the LLVM step with python's IR and they could probably expect a pretty substantial performance improvement. That said I don’t know anything about compilers, I just use both Python and Julia.treetalker 1 minute ago

on: What Happens to Artists' Studios After They Die?
Dalí's home and studio are open for public tours in Cadaqués (Catalunya), Spain. Worth a visit. The museum in Figueres is … okay. If you're a fan, go instead to the Dalí museum in Saint Petersburg, Florida. It's amazing and has many of his large-format masterworks, including Hallucinogenic Toreador.spongebobstoes 1 minute ago

Having paid $300 for a 10 minute doctor visit, in which I was confidently diagnosed incorrectly, it will not take much for me to minimize my doctor visits and take care into my own hands whenever possible.I will benefit from medical AI. There will soon come a point where I will pay a premium for my medical care to be reviewed by an AI, not the other way around.timschmidt 1 minute ago

Official communications to an international governmental agency are surely checked by multiple employees and subject to review by lawyers, marketing, C suite, etc.Apple said what they said.
It wasn't a mistake.
It was attempted deception.paxys 1 minute ago

One can find fulfilment in anything. You may think someone lazing on a beach all day is wasting their life, and they may think the same about a drone who is sitting in a windowless office for 60 hours a week from age 21 to 65 so their bosses can get richer. Family, community, art, relaxation, work - what is important in life is entirely up to you.jstimpfle 2 minutes ago

on: Wild performance tricks
No, C doesn't actually handle the _complexity_ of writing assembly. It abstracts and automates a lot of the repetitive work of doing register allocation etc -- sure. But these are very local issues -- I think it's fair to say that the complexity of a C program isn't really much lower than the equivalent program hand-coded in assembler.I'm not sure that LLVM would be the first consideration for complex, flexible, efficient? It's quite certainly not fast, in particular linking isn't. I'm not sure about Chromium, it would be interesting to look at some of the more interesting components like V8, rendering engine, OS interfacing, the multimedia stack... and how they're actually written. I'd suspect the code isn't slinging shared_ptr's and unique_ptrs and lambdas and is keeping use of templates minimal.theturtle 2 minutes ago

> The Internet’s next business model will be powered by pay-per-use, fractional payments, and microtransactions—tools that shift incentives toward original, creative content that actually adds valueI don't understand this. How is pay per use and paywalling content going to incentivize the creation of original content? If anything, people are more incentivized to create low quality, generic content because they're not directly accessible by humans.boogieknite 3 minutes ago

the formerit started as an approach to a mass legacy code migration. sound idea with potential to save time. i followed along and understood his markdown and agent stuff for analyzing and porting legacy codei reviewed results which apply to my projects. results were mixed bag but i think it saved some time overall. but now i dont get where hes going with his ai aspirationsmy best attempt to understand is he wants to work entirely though chats, no writing code, and hes doing so by improving agents through chats. hes really swept up in the entire concept. i consider myself optimistic about ai but his enthusiasm feels misplacedits to the point where his work is slipping and management is asking him where his results are. were a small team and management isnt savvy enough to see hes getting NOTHING done and i wont sell him out. however if this is a known delusional pattern id like to address it and point to a definition and/or past cases so he can recognize the pattern and avoid troubleasveikau 3 minutes ago

> I read minicomputer and assumed we were talking about the first home computers, which that was about their epoch.The minicomputers of the 1960s were only "mini" compared to earlier mainframes; they were still far too large and expensive for home users to even consider. Home computers didn't really come about until the late 1970s.saltcured 4 minutes ago

The article mentions a system for diabetic retinopathy diagnosis that is certified and has liability coverage.

on: Ollama Web Search
Ollama is a ycombinator startup, so I guess they have to find some roi at some point.[1]I personally found Ollama to be an easy way to try out local LLMs and appreciate them for that (and I still use it to download small models on my laptop and phone (via termux)), but I've long switched to llama.cpp + llama-swap[2] on my dev desktop. I download whatever ggufs I want from hugging face and just do `git pull` and `cmake --build build --config Release` from my llama.cpp directory whenever I want to update.1: https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/ollama

> There was never a country called Israel until 1948. It was always Palestine.Palestine was never a country before 1948, immediately prior to 1948 there was a British Mandate[0] with the name Palestine, but this mandate included land that would eventually turn into countries like Jordan(which just so happens to be a country with a Palestinian majority population). After 1948 and before 1967 the West Bank was annexed by Jordan and Gaza was occupied and administered by Egypt.The idea of a nation called Palestine is arguably a more recent invention than the nation of Israel.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandate_for_Palestinezachmoore 6 minutes ago

on: The story of DOGE, as told by federal workers
This petty score keeping is an intentional dodge of the real problems: This administration is doing ham-fisted execution of their strategy and trying to go around the law wherever they can get away with it.Any country that enforces immigration laws (almost all of them) will be constantly deporting people. Saying a lot of people were deported under Obama is an intentional dodge around the glaring fact that we have masked ICE agents doing ham-fisted raids and doing extraordinarily dumb things like detaining factory workers at an important battery plant just because.More
