on: Fewer H-1B Visas Did Not Mean More Employment for ...
"based on data for the fiscal years 2002-09"That was the period of time after the dot-com bust where companies were racing to offshore (while laying off local workers).
And then there was the 2007-9 Great Recession, which also had a huge negative impact on employment.Cherry picking those years to use as evidence that reducing H1-Bs didn't cause local employment to increase (intentionally?) fails to control for confounding variables.overfeed 0 minutes ago

From the abstract, its the inherent noise. So it's going to be some variance of monte carlo random approaches, or simulated annealing where "beneficial noise" helps find a useful optimum better than the others found so far.(not a mathematician, and happy to be shot down in flames)Since most systems looking at generalised QC want to minimise noise, and it's only the systems which do Quantum Annealing which "work" right now, I'd say this is a niche use case which will make a lot of money, right up to the point the cost of the machine drops so everyone does it, and then the market is back where it needs to be: equally available to all players, at least "all players who can afford time on a QC which does QA"msephton 0 minutes ago

[update] just signed up and very curious where the data comes from? I managed to find businesses that use Github which is incredibly useful for me. It is missing some Javascript frameworks like NextJS but i think thats not a big deal…Where does the technographic data come from? Is it scraped from websites? Or are you relying on another 3rd party source?Is there anyway to get some trends data like how Builtwith has trend insights on how many of the top 100k websites use something like NextJS over time?andsoitis 1 minute ago

No, they had no ads for several years.
AdWords were introduced in 02000, at which point Google had existed (initially as google.stanford.edu) for four years, since 01996, which was 40% of the amount of time the Web had even existed.
I started using Google in probably 01998, when people on Slashdot got excited about how much better their search quality was than AltaVista, but it probably wasn't until 01999 that I switched over completely—at first AltaVista still had better coverage.nadalishhh 1 minute ago

on: Markov chains are the original language models
Exactly right on the mathematical equivalence! Your clarification of the Markov property is crucial - the conditional independence given the present state is what defines it, regardless of how complex that state representation becomes.The key insight you raise about attention is particularly important: it doesn't violate the Markov property, it just enables a vastly more sophisticated state representation. Classical n-gram Markov chains use simple discrete states, while transformers use high-dimensional continuous representations that can encode exponentially more information about context.This perspective helps bridge the conceptual gap many people have. When they think "Markov chain," they often picture simple state transitions, but mathematically, LLMs are just Markov chains with astronomically complex states. The attention mechanism is the computational trick that makes these complex states tractable - it's not changing the fundamental probabilistic structure.pinkmuffinere 1 minute ago

My favorite one thus far has been:> was there a US president named Bob, Robert, or who went by either?> No U.S. president has ever gone by Bob or Robert as their common or official name. The closest case is James A. Garfield (20th president), whose full name was James Abram Garfield — no Robert in thereWhy is James A. Garfield the closest????

on: Markov chains are the original language models
Your 2D bitmap example perfectly illustrates the fundamental limitation! The exponential state explosion you encountered (needing 2^32 states for patterns separated by randomness) is precisely why classical Markov chains became intractable for complex dependencies.What's fascinating is that transformers with attention don't actually escape the Markov property - they're mathematically equivalent to very high-order Markov chains where the entire context window forms the "state." The breakthrough wasn't abandoning Markov chains, but finding a parameterized way to approximate these massive state spaces through learned representations rather than explicit enumeration.Your observation about inevitably trending toward attention-like mechanisms is spot-on. The attention mechanism essentially provides a tractable approximation to the astronomically large transition matrices that would be required for a classical Markov chain to capture long-range dependencies. It's a more elegant solution to the same fundamental problem you were solving with skip states.potato3732842 1 minute ago

So what's crazy about this is that I remember, when I first joined Google in 2011, that they were particularly proud of how people would just stop using URLs and use Google to navigate. So people would type "amazon" to get to Amazon.com instead of actually typing out `amazon.com`, or using a bookmark or directory etc. And they wanted to keep search at a quality that would continue to get people to do that. And later the fear with mobile becoming ascendant was that people would stop using search in this way, etc.But it looks like they just keep giving people more and more reason to... not do that.defrost 2 minutes ago

on: AWS announces EC2 instance attestation
I'm a bit confused.This is described as being related to 'NitroTPM', which is described as a 'virtual device [...] which conforms to the TPM 2.0 specification'.Ordinarily, the way you do attestation with a TPM is to perform a TPM quote operation, which provides a TPM-signed attestation of a set of PCRs.This is... not that. This appears (judging by looking at the source code for some of the provided tools) to be invoking an undocumented(?) vendor-specific command on the TPM device which appears related to the previous Nitro Secure Enclaves support. When AWS introduced Nitro Secure Enclaves, they came up with their own signed attestation document format rather than reusing the TPM standard, then added support for that format to KMS.The documentation also states: "An Attestation Document is generated by the NitroTPM and it is signed by the Nitro Hypervisor."This seems to suggest that different entities are responsible for generating AWS's Attestation Document and for signing it, which seems rather odd. What's going on here?If AWS's claims that NitroTPM is TPM 2.0 compliant are true, it seems like there are now basically two completely different APIs for remote attestation exposed via the TPM virtual device: TPM 2.0 Quote operations and AWS Attestation Documents via an undocumented(?) vendor-specific API.I can understand wanting to take this approach for consistency with their previous Nitro Secure Enclaves API but it's at the expense of consistency with the existing TPM 2.0 standard. Presumably if you want to use KMS with this you have to use their Attestation Document format rather than a TPM 2.0 Quote, forcing you to use a vendor specific API with it.Just some thoughts, and this is just my quick impression. I could be mistaken. In any case, having this functionality with a viable KMS tie-in is certainly valuable, so it's nice to see in the sense that you no longer have to create a Nitro Secure Enclave to get this kind of functionality if you don't need the dual compartments separated via a vsock.bojangleslover 2 minutes ago

I totally agree - yes, the current AI tools will definitely change, but the difference in AI-tooling specifics is much smaller than the difference between "no AI assistance at all" and an agentic-AI heavy coding process.And I say this as someone who didn't make the transition after 25 years as a software engineer. While I get a lot of value out of AI, I felt it largely changed my job from "mostly author" to "mostly editor", and I just didn't enjoy it nearly as much, so I got out of software altogether and went to violin making school.Hobadee 3 minutes ago
