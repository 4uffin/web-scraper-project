That isn't explanatory. If they cared about the financial investment then they wouldn't be regularly smashing their phones in the first place because it is clearly possible to do without a case. It is a side effect of behavior.frogperson 1 minute ago

Thats awesome, I'm so glad someone like Larry Ellison of all people get to influence the American youth for the next decade.

I'm surprised there isn't moralizing about the price point. I don't see why the US is so far behind in manufacturing efficiency. Everything seem to be 10-100x the cost of comparable Chinese goods, and US labor isn't paid anywhere close to 100x more.1121redblackgo 1 minute ago

They must be struggling to hit their perf/w targets if this ended up being necessary.These phones are not going to age well, the paste or thermal pads is not going to last. Larger sheets of graphene for full size processors and gpus are good for a decade, at this size it'll be lucky to get to 5.rapind 2 minutes ago

Those can be business decisions too though. It depends on whether or not the real / lucrative customers will notice, or maybe the noisy customers who will be all over twitter because a dev figured they'd make a big change like this on their own.Throttling and tiering can definitely affect more people than you might suspect (like spiky services) and considering data and use are important.dlivingston 3 minutes ago

> I'm not convinced that convergent UI works either. The needs of desktop and mobile just differ too greatly.For the record, I agree. But I've been playing with Apple's new Liquid Glass UI on macOS / iOS and I think they've done a pretty good job of defining platform-agnostic UI primitives and layouts with some platform-specific rules when needed.It's a big redesign that covers desktop / mobile / tablet / TV. They did a pretty clever job of it, though the desktop experience suffers slightly (of course).nenenejej 3 minutes ago

Feel free to correct me if I’m off base, but it doesn’t seem like the robot is actually slicing.
Looks more like it’s just mashing the blade into the tomato.
In this case I can see how the vibration can make up for the lack of slicing action.
Ie sliding the blade across the tomato.My question is would there still be an improvement if they used a slicing action?yeti-winter 3 minutes ago

I think that the (unsatisfying) answer is that there's no established standard for how protocol selection works. nip04 and nip44 are completely different types of messages, and it's up to the client how it'll use and/or respond to them.drzaiusx11 4 minutes ago

on: Revamping an Old TV as a Gift (2019)
When I was very young (~10yo), I was obsessed with taking apart any electronics I could get my hands in an attempt to figure out how it all worked.Somehow I got my hands on a semi-functional CRT oscilloscope and of course took it apart. Within minutes of the initial disassembly, I accidentally discharged a large capacitor through my body. I still remember the blinding pain and passing out from literal shock. I'm lucky to be alive today. I gained a healthy fear of electricity that day.Through the many years that followed I continued my trajectory in electronics, eventually designing and fabbing my own analog and digital circuits. Today I continue to be extremely careful whenever dealing with power circuitry. Always proceed with caution!tomnipotent 4 minutes ago

> You seem to think peopleI don't think, I know. Read the comments. No one here besides the original OP was impacted but everyone wants to pile-on and call them out with absolutely no real context while pulling conspiracy theories out of thin air and making statements about what must be true. I've seen very few actual posts where attempt to engage legitimately rather than some bullshit "gotcha!" comment.>
a response by the CPO of SlackYes, two days after the email was sent. Two days. Folks are whining that it wasn't "faster", that somehow these people are not reviewing every email that leaves the company.> calling them out on the things their responses do not addressNo most people are throwing accusations and making absolute statements of what they perceive to be truth. No one besides the original OP is entitled to a response from Slack, everyone else here is just using it as an opportunity to virtual signal. Why would anyone from Slack engage in this thread filled with hostility and zero lack of desire to understand what happened, because they're so convinced they already have the answer?This thread is an embarrassment to the HN community, and we can go back years and find similar situations where company screwed up and will not find the vitriol found here.tptacek 4 minutes ago

Funny, elsewhere in this thread (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45315574) you argue that "'terrorist' is the new n-word", basically an illegitimate term used as cover for racism. Yet here you are, using that term yourself, to score points in a debate.So which is? Is terrorism a made-up word used by racists? Or is terrorism a legitimate word to designate bad people, and the US is to blame for these bad people existing?apical_dendrite 4 minutes ago

Don't you think that they would have tried that if it was an option?For academics, it's a global market for talent. There may only be a small number of people in the world who are doing top research in a particular area.For rural healthcare, if you're a hospital in a very poor, very remote area, and you want to hire say, an anesthesiologist, you have to hire someone who could make very good money working anywhere, but is willing to work at your hospital. $10k is not going to cut it.charcircuit 5 minutes ago

You just pay the tax. 10% early withdrawal penalty plus about 10% federal income tax up to about $50k. Obviously it would be nice to not have to pay that tax at all by waiting until retirement age, but depending on your cost basis and your other income, it's less than you would have paid in income tax at the time of deposit plus short term cap gains at the time of withdrawal if you had not put it in the 401k in the first place. If your previous wage was high enough and cost basis low enough, then it might even be less than income tax at time of deposit plus long term cap gains at time of withdrawal.danny_codes 5 minutes ago

> The way it plays out is that the jobs are just offshore to jurisdictions that lack the same labor and environmental protections.A valid critique of how globalism was implemented in the US. However, this concern could be heavily ameliorated by policy. For example, making US companies using foreign labor adhere to the same labor standards they must adhere to domestically.Perhaps a reason you’re baffled is because you are thinking only of domestic labor instead of global labor. Most Pro-labor people would, I imagine, consider the global labor pool in their analysis.abrookewood 5 minutes ago
