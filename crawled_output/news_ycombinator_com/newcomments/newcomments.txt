on: Raspberry Pi 500+
The Pi 5 finally upgraded to an out-of-order CPU, so it's ~3x faster than a Pi 4. It's a huge jump. The caveat being it definitely needs a cooling solution now.Pi 4: https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/976221Pi 5: https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/9348462but for funsies, an N150 (same price as a Pi 5 - arguably cheaper since it comes with a case, cooling, power supply, etc...): https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/10304384nighthawk454 0 minutes ago

on: Providing support for Windows 10 refugees
I see Zorin OS* mentioned regularly in writeups like these to help people leaving Windows and looking for an alternative.Maybe it's just a misunderstanding on my part, but Zorin seems to have a tiny (2-10 people, likely on the low end) roster of developers deeply involved.Why would Zorin, or any OS with a tiny dev team, even be a possibility worth mentioning for people using Windows?*Zorin is often listed as having two brothers who maintain it, but put any smaller-than-a-local-coffee-shop distros keep getting listed as realistic alternates?hawflakes 1 minute ago

on: Athlon 64: How AMD turned the tables on Intel
Did the PA-RISC shops run their old PA-RISC code with the Aries emulator?One of the selling points for HP users was running old code via dynamic translation and x86 would just work on the hardware directly.Another fun fact I remember from working at HP was that later PA-RISC chips were fabbed at Intel because the HP-Intel agreement had Intel fabbing a certain amount of chips and since Merced was running behind... Intel-fabbed PA-RISC chips!https://community.hpe.com/t5/operating-system-hp-ux/parisc-p...JumpCrisscross 1 minute ago

Cruise missiles fired from the Red Sea would spend nearly an hour flying over Saudi Arabia.. I didn’t say Qatar would detect them, but the US and Saudi air defenses based in Saudi Arabia would certainly.Hence why Israel used ballistic missiles that likely reached 30+ km in altitude over Saudi air space and impacted in less than 15 minutes after launch.ChrisNorstrom 2 minutes ago

Hi, Thank you so much for this. Brutalita is PERFECT, I edited the BGRP letters and will be using it for a new game I'm working on. I was just looking for something like this, kinda futuristic but minimal and simple. I love it.wahnfrieden 2 minutes ago

on: The story of DOGE, as told by federal workers
>and that's notable because DOGE completely circumvented congress who is supposed to be the sole possessor of the power of the purse.Congress has the constitutional power of the purse but that refers specifically to raising and appropriating money[].The executive has the power to actually go out and spend the appropriated money.
Congress tried to usurp that power around the time of Nixon by stopping executive impoundment.
But it's not clear if that's constitutional; it might be now under current SCOTUS interpretations but I wouldn't be surprised if SCOTUS reviews it and find that to be incorrect.Personally I think congress usurping power of impoundment is a bright and clear violation of checks and balances built into the constitution that requires two branches to approve of spending before it can actually get spent.
DOGE was a valiant attempt to bring us back into constitutional compliance.[] https://history.house.gov/Institution/Origins-Development/Po...BrenBarn 3 minutes ago

on: Microsoft blocks Israel’s use of its tech in mass ...
In other comments replying to another user you dismissed "criticisms from the 90s", but I think that's not entirely justified.
If the bad things they did in the 90s are still having bad effects today, and they built their success on those bad things, then it's not really enough just to stop doing them; they would need to actively try to right those past wrongs.However, even in the present, the increasing intrusiveness of their update schemes, forcing people to have a Microsoft account even to install Windows, shoving AI into people's faces at every opportunity, etc., would all count as reasons I think they are bad.
Also I tend to think in general that simply existing as a giant corporation with large market share is bad.To be clear, I also think that Apple, Google, Amazon, etc., are also very very bad.
I think I'd agree that these days Microsoft is on the lower end of badness among these megacorps.
However, that's partly just because it's become somewhat weaker than it was at the height of its badness.
You could argue that this isn't "badness" but something like "ability to implement badness" but I see those as pretty closely tied.
Basically the bigger a corporation becomes, the harder it has to work to avoid being bad.pansa2 4 minutes ago

IIRC Julia's is a particularly simple method-based JIT for a dynamically-typed language.I'm not sure exactly how it differs from most JavaScript JITs, but I believe it just compiles each method once for each set of function argument types - for example, it doesn't try to dynamically determine the types of local variables.jeffchuber 4 minutes ago

No one is 100% sure of medical diagnosis, jeesh. Quite a few people ignore the symptoms of serious diseases until its too late and others go in for minor things.Not even medical doctors can sure of a diagnosis, where of themselves or others.

on: The Digital Markets Act: time for a reset
The same can be said about the EU bureaucracies, why do they have a disproportionate amount of control and oversight in daily lives of EU citizens?We need a full reset from them. Countries should get their powers back. Take it back from the non elected EU bureaucrats.There are some very worrisome things going on in the EU with Chat Control, Ministry of Truth, Digital ID Systems, and Central Bank Digital Currencies.Each individual piece will be introduced to fix something or prevent something. But it is a slippery slope to also use it for something else, and more and more. Before we know it we will live in a continent that is ruled by an authoritarian mob like in China.Freedom2 4 minutes ago

on: The Wind, a Pole, and the Dragon
I’ll play!Chat thinks it’s a kana segmentation error in a list of possible hypothesized problems/causes that get mis-rendered as literal nouns, such as “XML風, 設定方法, 処理の流れ / 処理流” such that roughly
“XML style” -> “-style” -> “wind”,
“setting method” -> “-method” -> “pole”,
“processing flow” -> “-flow” -> “dragon”(Note that XMl, setting, and processing are just examples to illustrate.)The LLM assures me that “Japanese writers often end diagnostic questions with a compact list of possible causes (A、B、Cでしょうか？).”Its final verdict:
“very likely the English “wind, pole, dragon” = MT literal translations of a compact Japanese list such as 〜風、〜法（方法）、〜流 (-style, -method, -flow). The pattern, repetition, and the fact they appear at question ends all support this strongly.”woggy 5 minutes ago

on: Redis is fast – I'll cache in Postgres
I hope you remember to add monitoring for your cache expiry cron job so you can be notified if it ever fails to run due to a code change or configuration change. For example, database credentials might be rolled and if you forget to update the job your primary database could fill up.Perhaps you could have a second cron job that runs to verify that the first one completed. It could look for a last-ran entry. You should put it in the same database, so maybe perhaps you could a key value store like redis for that.modeless 5 minutes ago

They also talk about the reversal of the Chicago river so the sewerage went down the Des Planes and onto the Mississippi instead of the great lakes. This was of benefit to Chicago residents since they drank out of lake Michigan.
