on: Meta’s live demo fails; “AI” recording plays befor...
The most spectacular failure was when I asked it to make a logo for a project. The project has "cogs" in the title but that refers to Cost of Goods Sold not the physical object, so I specified that it should not include a cog a in the logo. Of course, it included a cog in the logo.I asked it to help me create a business plan. Partway through it switched to Indonesian language, for no reason I could see. Then, after about two hours work on the plan, with about 200K tokens in the context, it stopped outputting anything reasonable.I have tried to get it to help with Google Sheets formulae about a dozen times so far. Not once has it actually got anything right. Not once.It's serviceable as a chatbot, but completely useless if you try to get it to actually do anything.Lerc 2 minutes ago

In a lot of ways AI can give unskilled people just enough knowledge to be dangerous. The unfinished novel Bouvard et Pécuchet by Gustave Flaubert [1] revolves around this idea by telling a story of two clerks who come into a sizeable fortune and attempt to work their way through every branch of knowledge but failing to drink deep of the proverbial Pierian spring.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouvard_et_P%C3%A9cuchetFridayoLeary 2 minutes ago

The funny thing is that an oxygen-rich environment is a hell-hole! Oxygen is insanely reactive and will corrode anything. Even early life on earth found oxygen toxic. It was released as a waste product by early life and they were so successful that all that oxygen accumulated resulting in the Great Oxidation Event (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Oxidation_Event).That likely resulted in many species going extinct!lwhi 2 minutes ago

I see your point, I really do. We all have the ability to achieve, and there shouldn't be a limit on that potential.However, that's exactly what the class system in the UK does. The potential of oeople born into lower classes of society is actively limited.nucleogenesis 3 minutes ago

For me it’s just that I just don’t want to lie to make money.Commercials are on their face a work of fiction unless stated otherwise — for customer testimonials in commercials that are fake (in the US anyway) there has to be text saying as much. Because otherwise they’d be lying…al_borland 3 minutes ago

on: Ask HN: Is America Going to Become an Autocracy?
Saying Congress is under autocratic control is hyperbole. There is a slight Republican advantage, smaller than the Democrat’s advantage during Biden’s term. The big beautiful bill didn’t sail through Congress, it took a while and the vote was close… a whole bunch of nonsense went on to get that through. If it was autocratic control, Trump wouldn’t be signing a million executive orders, he could sail them right through Congress and make them much stronger.The important question to ask, is why the Democrats have had such a hard time winning at the polls? Clearly the message of “we’re not Trump” isn’t enough for voters, and voters also don’t like candidates being chosen for them (even Bernie agreed that the Democrats haven’t had an honest primary since 2008). The party is broken, and it’s easy to point the finger at the right, but the Democrats have been hemorrhaging voters and still seem unable to get their act together enough to win people back. There is a growing center that feels both parties have left them behind, and it would be great if the Democrats could wake up, see that, and move forward with an ounce of common sense to win them back.Balance won’t be restored by demonizing the right, it will be restored by the Democrats getting their own house in order, before they claim to have the answers for the country.At this point, both parties might be too far gone. I’d be happy to see them both implode and new parties emerge without all the baggage of the past.dghlsakjg 3 minutes ago

on: Why, as a responsible adult, SimCity 2000 hits dif...
You guys are talking past each other.One of you is pointing out that cars are a necessity for some in the current reality. The other is pointing out that we could change that reality like other places have.You are both right.I am very against the continuation of car primacy in urban design, but I live in a place where that is the current reality, so for all practical reasons I need at least one car in my household. I advocate for the changes so that isn't true and see that it is possible to live otherwise, but it isn't reality right now, so I own a car. Me owning a car isn't to "rationalize [my] bad choices and poor capacity for civic organization." I do it because the housing that I can afford, in the country that I live in is in an area where that is necessary. In the meantime I advocate for better transit and other options, but I am not omnipotent, and even those with tremendous amounts of power cannot make these changes happen quickly given the 75+ years of infrastructure and urban design.You are tremendously mean-spirited and un-empathetic in proclaiming that those that don't agree with you are 'lazy' and 'not willing to sacrifice their own convenience for some communal benefit'.Try understanding where people are coming from. Many believe as strongly as you do, and can provide just as many backing youtube videos, that cars are an unalloyed good. If you come at them this aggressively telling them that the places they live are just plain wrong, you will not convince them of anything.As an aside, the Dutch aren't nearly as car free as you are presenting. They are in the top 25% for per capita car ownership worldwide, and have higher rates of car ownership rates than Denmark, Sweden, Greece and Croatia which isn't even all of the countries in Europe with lower rates of car ownership. Hell, they have more than double the rate of car ownership of Saudi Arabia, a country that subsidizes fuel prices to encourage car use.Retric 4 minutes ago

There’s many illegal things which can boost a companies bottom line.
Quite often the law cares about what’s a reasonable effort which is a very different standard than what maximizes profits.Something which may or may not decrease their bottom line but definitely significantly reduces counterfeit items ending up in customers hands is going to be considered reasonable even if it’s not profit maximizing.duxup 4 minutes ago

on: Zig got a new ELF linker and it's fast
Looking in the source tree, it doesn't look like it has it's own entry point. Zig is heading in the direction of a very verticall integrated compilation stack (I believe this is where most of the speed up comes from), so I'm not really sure of the utility with using it outside of the Zig world.https://github.com/jacobly0/zig/tree/4508c2543508e04253471e1...

on: Rail travel is booming in America
Amtrak would benefit from a coach-class sleeper, like they have in India or in Eastern Europe. They just need coach benches that convert to beds. If, for a reasonable price, you could lie flat at night behind a little curtain, like you can in e.g. Indian Railways 2nd Class, it would change the game completely. Without that, you can only travel comfortably during the day, and trips are limited to about eight hours for the non-masochist. With it, cross country would be fine.duk3luk3 5 minutes ago

OK, so what do you recommend I do? Go out and protest instead of focusing on educating my child, eating healthy, and making my kids are healthy?Read every single news article on how this admin is corruption, instead of trying to learn things that will help me earn more money?Your advice sounds nice in an ideal vacuum where people have 100 hours in a day, lots of leisure time, and don't have to worry about bills, or putting food in the dinner table.NewJazz 5 minutes ago

People often underestimate how harsh their words come across to others when posting them on a web forum. If you intended them with sincerity, that’s fine, but one can easily read your words in the way that is often meant as a hurtful attack. Please take more care to ensure your words are clearly, sincerely kind in future.krastanov 6 minutes ago

on: iFixit iPhone Air teardown
That would be an unacceptably fat foldable. Foldables are 4.1mm to 4.2mm at the head of the class and iPhone Air is 5.6mm. Double that and add a bit for folding and you're still under 9mm (acceptable) with today's leading folders, and about 12mm (not acceptable) for the hypothetical Air.PaulHoule 8 minutes ago

on: The biggest problem with Liquid Glass
I'm not against it per se but it looks like somebody applied anti-anti aliasing to the time that displays on the lock screen to my phone.
I don't see "this is a cutting edge user interface that's visually consistent",
it looks like the settings icon is weirdly dark grey,
kinda like somebody did some subtle vandalism to whatever strokes the edges of things.More
