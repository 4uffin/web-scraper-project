It’s not that difficult to become a billionaire. If you can collect $1 dollar from a billion people, you’ll be a billionaire. If you increase that to $10, you only need 100 million people, roughly a third of the United States.What you need is some kind of platform on which you could collect those dollars. In recent history the internet has become a powerful platform and that is why we have so many more billionaires.But what has not changed is our sensitivity to good deeds. If you’re a billionaire, giving all your wealth away is not really going to be appreciated much more than doing some highly visible good deeds that give smaller amounts of wealth away. So why do it? You’re better off staying a billionaire until you die, after which your wealth will be distributed anyway.alephnerd 0 minutes ago

I sure wish SpaceX would just open source their designs to that nations around the world can join the space race, we can truly evolve as a whole species and not just as national identities, and we can get on with mining Psyche 16.That would be a truly revolutionary human endeavour, imho.Meanwhile, we're lobbing rockets at each other to kill innocents at massive scale, when we could, as an entire species, be building literal cities in the sky.Nevertheless if Europe starts making progress, I'm sure it'll catch up with the USA and China.
Some day.

very good at producing something that reads like the kind of document I asked for and not as good at guaranteeing that the document has the meaning I intended.alistairSH 0 minutes ago

on: The War on Roommates: Why Is Sharing a House Illeg...
The article doesn't make this clear... is sharing a house illegal, or is it only illegal to separate leases for each room?Immediately post-college, I shared houses with other 20-somethings. It was always a single lease - 4 roommates listed, 4 beds, all of us responsible for the full amount of the rent.
But, we were absolutely allowed to reside in the same home.
Same thing in college - single lease for four people in a four bedroom apartment.ZeroGravitas 0 minutes ago

I wonder what kinds of techniques, if any, these virtual cell phones employ to evade being discovered. You would suspect that they could be discovered through triangulation.Two possibilities:1. Most if not all of these virtual cell phones are connecting from the same location.2. Some of these virtual cell phones are connecting from the same location, with the remainder in reserve.In the case of (1), you have both a fixed location and a high saturation that is unlikely.In the case of (2), you could imagine using certain numbers at certain times to simulate the work day or hours during which people are more likely to be at home. Randomization or round robin could produce unlikely patterns, but without them, these virtual phones would be underutilized, save for some kind of cyberattack that would compromise their location.Or the truth simply may be that they aren't doing anything, because no one is watching.AnotherGoodName 0 minutes ago

Where are these types of places illegal in reality?I know of single room rentals available in pretty much every major metro in the world. Shared common bathroom and kitchen.I also know of one in plenty of subletting of multi-bedroom apartments.I have never heard of enforcement against this. It also doesn’t bring rents down as much as claimed.gregorymichael 0 minutes ago

Looking at the original press release (https://www.secretservice.gov/newsroom/releases/2025/09/us-s...) and the attached high-resolution photographs, there are things that probably leap out at a Hacker News readership:The Bad Guys are neat with their cable ties, and number their gateway boxes.The Bad Guys went with simple heavy-duty metal garage shelving rather than real racking, seemingly vastly overengineered for the weight of the equipment, as that sort of shelving can hold up to a Mg per shelf UDL.
The "WallOfSimBoxes" kit does not sport any rack mounting brackets.The Bad Guys don't use redundant power supplies, or battery backup.dreamcompiler 1 minute ago

The original title is almost double the maximum length for HN titles, and it’s confusingly dry. I do agree the current title could be slightly misleading, but hopefully there is a middle ground. I don’t have a suggestion offhand, but if you do, HN moderators do tend to take user suggestions into account in these cases.alephnerd 1 minute ago

> How do you justify...It's easy.
I just remind myself that, in about 5 billion years, the Sun will have sufficiently run out of fuel to begin its transition to a Red Giant.
At that point, all remnants of biologic life that ever lived on the crust of the earth will be incinerated and it won't have mattered whether anyone carefully conserved the precious time remaining in their lives or not.
I have so thoroughly incorporated this understanding into my psyche that I can merely blink now and all of that context is immediately present to me.mhb 1 minute ago

I thought the entire goal was to get to a point where you're checked out? Retirement. The issue is income hasn't kept up with inflation and definitely not the rents required for older gen folks to survive on their own.Perspective: My mother owned a home in a wealthy area of Virginia, her mortgage was $1200/mo for 30 years. When she sold it (for double what she paid for it) she thought she was rich. Then came the assisted living rent bill of $8k/mo. She realized she only has a few years to live on her life savings. It's a generational rug pull and kicking the ladder out from those climbing. It's going to end very badly.mig4ng 1 minute ago

I have been sharing house with a roommate for years now (in Portugal), and I prefer it to living alone. Even with a girlfriend, I highly prefer to live in a house with more people.I come from a "big" family, and I am used to movement where I live. And living alone or just with one person, makes my energy go down.Now that I plan on moving to Paraguay, I am looking for co-living options or someone to rent place with.
Different people have different preferred ways of living.For me, it's cheaper, and I am happier, when I share place with other people. Also, you get to learn from others, have people to talk with, at the expense of a bit of privacy. But depending on the roommates you choose the privacy thing is usually not an issue.jaapz 1 minute ago
