I feel you. After working in tech for 19 years, going on 20. I am utterly sick of it, too.Sadly, I struck out badly in the startup lottery. So I'm broke and can't afford to move to a farm or something like that. Wish I could do things differently now.jandrewrogers 0 minutes ago

The dotcom boom happened in Silicon Valley, not San Francisco. All of the action was in the Santa Clara valley. Things moved toward San Francisco during the social media boom that happened many years later.WaltPurvis 0 minutes ago

One of the greatest comments posted on this site:noname123 on March 27, 2016 | parent | context | un‑favorite | on: My year in startup hell>It's brilliant, I'd never want to work for a corporate company! We have regular parties, play table tennis daily, beers on Friday. It just makes work so much more enjoyable.When you leave or a bunch of your friends who used to go to happy hour together leave "for better opportunities," you'll realize that most people who are your work drinking buddies didn't really know you or felt or thought deeply about your personal experiences. (It's not that they're bad people, it's just what happens when people are put in an artificial social environment where people slap high-fives after work rec dogeball and shout out witty one-liners).Also when you realize after 5 or 6 years of working, and the startup mantra of "changing the world," your other friends whom you laughed at before, toiling away in their fields have started coming on their own. You have only pushed bits for marketing, spam, online shopping, on-demand on-gig economy for people like yourself to get a stick of gum delivered in an hour. You can try to justify how you are promoted from junior all the way to lead to technical product manager, or how you led your team to switch from Rails to Node, SQL to Cassandra, Java to Scala. But you'll begin to see the thin-veneer of how little management cares about tech and how most of it is a pep-rally, a race to the bottom for those at the top of the Ponzi scheme to enrich themselves.You look at other people in other fields or in other area's of tech. At work cafeteria IKEA lunch table (after a lengthy morning standup where there was yet another pissing match about React vs. Angular), People shoot the breeze about AlphaGo or that Tay twitter bot, and someone else shoot another witty one-liner comeback, everyone laughs, one person groans - in between the silence after the reactions settle in, it dawns slowly on your mind that we've all become spectators in the real information technology revolution.That what you are toiling away when you go back to your desk after this lunch conversation is just another Twitter stream, another HN comment, Instagram heart, albeit decorated in syntax highlighting to the "AWS/Google Cloud/Azure Twitterverse."That is just the same as the well-dressed girl or guy sitting in the next row over in the open-office environment, whom you never talk to but to make yourself feel better, secretly put down in your mind because what they do "is so much BS, social media customer engagement"; but they are the same, and you're all the same...You call your friends up from college and hear their stories at the precarious precipice of 28-30. How many hours they stayed up at the hospital during a rotation, and a critical debate they had with their attending whether to admit a patient; or how many e-mails they had to sent to get their 15 minute film considered at 50 different film festivals; or staying on after getting finally their PhD, to work for free to do the technology transfer to industry the physics research they worked on in their group; and always, the one-liner remark, "tech has it so much better, you guys make so much money!"Of course, the response begets a begrudging smile or another sequitur to equalize the conversation; but come work Monday, the habit to don on the noise canceling headphones, the cursory checks on social media to keep abreast fantasy football leagues/stock portfolio's, the internal monologue of the recalculation how much your employee stock options are going to be worth/vest, have all become instinctive rituals to not let the existential dread set in.https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11370776UtopiaPunk 0 minutes ago

I have a toddler. We never let them play with a smartphone or tablet. Occasionally we show family photos, and rarely we will show them a video. But an adult is always holding the device and in control.The toddler does have a "Yoto," which is a thing that plays music and little stories for kids. They love it, and I think it's kind of cool. We also let them watch a few shows on TV, but only during the afternoon. It usually gives the adults a chance to do something else, like cook dinner, but if there's an adult available, we try to do something else besides watch TV. Jellyfin has been great for curating a small list of parent-approved shows, with no other shows vying for my kid's attention.When they get a little older, I would like to introduce video games. It would be either a home console with no online connection, or maybe some kind of Linux box that I've locked down.We will be avoiding social media and similar platforms for as long as we can. That is where I feel the most worst, brain-warping dangers exist.andrewmcwatters 0 minutes ago

Actually, save power efficiency, Apple is still behind the curve and has been for decades. Nvidia has reigned uninterrupted for longer than I can remember and regularly beats Apple in raw performance on available hardware, and AMD has regularly topped benchmarks for years.In fact, AMD and Nvidia have been the de facto high-performance combination for so long, that I can't remember when it was any different. But prior to that, it was Intel and Nvidia. Apple was never a real high quality hardware competitor. The only thing they ever had to offer were products produced by a production process almost no one replicates.Razer started used CNC unibodies for their laptops 14 years ago, but they're maybe the only company I can think of that does so other than Apple.And MSI has shipped high performance laptops for so long that even Apple used their laptops for comparison during the M-series chip releases in the MacBook Pro.thwarted 0 minutes ago

The tech scene in SF and the Bay Area at large was taking its last breath in 2015. When I arrived in SF in 2007, it was, in retrospect, already on its way out. But you could still walk down Mission in SOMA and overhear people talking about Apache configuration, witness technical team meetings in Yerba Buena Gardens, or run into the same people from another company's engineering team at the rotating schedule of bespoke coffee places (if the online camera someone setup across the alley from Blue Bottle indicated it was to busy, Special Xtra was the closer alternative). In 2015, South Park was waning as a startup office Mecca. Overhearing technical discussions and interviews at coffee shops and bars was replaced with overhearing discussions about pitch decks and VC meetings.By 2015, the industry was fully infected with finance bros drawn to "easy VC money". This when we got non-viable startups like juicero, flower delivery, or one that would pick up your mail and scan it. Companies like WeWork and Uber being tech companies because they have an "app" made everyone think all you needed was an app to be a tech company, and having an app was defacto required to get VC investment.The trends have always been evident from the billboards you'd see in the city and along 101. They have become more homogeneous with AI content more recently, but the blockchain/Bitcoin cycle was pretty homogeneous too.I don't know that's there more far-right. But there is less of the free-spirit hippy branding (which was riding on 60s and 70s nostalgia anyway). Mention going to Burning Man and people say "Really?" rather than "Cool". The people who got rich over a decade ago got older.The advertising/billboards do reflect/are the zeitgeist. There are conversations about working at an AI startup or how their pitch is based on AI at the coffee shop I frequent, which is outside SOMA/FiDi (and in view of the GGB). I don't think it's more sinister, SF still feels like California, at least in terms of the coastal relaxed attitude and hope if not in terms of being a big tech draw. Thanks to COVID, coming to the Bay Area to work in tech isn't required, or expected, anymore, which makes all the narrowly focused billboards seem odd: who are they advertising to other than other AI startups?eloisius 0 minutes ago

That's a fascinating parallel! both involve separating timeless constraints (value function / elliptic equation) from temporal dynamics (policy / flux evolution).Trying to timestep through a constraint that should hold instantaneously creates artificial numerical difficulties. The Bellman equation's value iteration is actually another example of this same pattern...IncreasePosts 1 minute ago

Not really. Protecting by law ones right to withhold information that would incriminate them is one thing. But the incarcerated guy doesn't claim there's anything incriminating in these files. He simply stated he doesn't want to share it with the cops.My understanding is, it's not like the FBI got a warrant for this etc, and instead started flinging shit at him - which is clearly bad. But for this narrow argument, that's besides the point, IMHO (IANAL). Because in the first place, the guy simply didn't want to share this information with law enforcement. There is no claim that it incriminates him.structural 1 minute ago

The threading model is still difficult, and it's still enough slower that thinking you're going to be comparable to custom silicon that's been designed for a particular protocol is silly.It's great fun for doing signal analysis, but I'd never want to try and implement a full-duplex communication system in production with it.leah_pmm 1 minute ago

Every complaint about things like this can be fixed by the dev caring. There are cons to React, but they can all be mitigated. The ideal React app would behave like a plain HTML page, but with benefits to interactivity and development speed/maintenance.The truth, though, is that most just don’t _care_ to prioritize this.efortis 1 minute ago

I partially agree, but that does mitigate it. The report says the attacker injected a `postinstall` script, which is common.On the other hand, yes, an attack at code level, or a legit bug wouldn't be prevented.ainka-ainka 2 minutes ago

Not the OP, but I have kept one of these in all of my cars for years. I keep mine in the armrest storage space. I’ve never needed it, but it always gets transferred from old car to new.

This perception is more a result of humans' powerful negativity bias. Negative news and views get orders of magnitude more engagement and propagation than positive ones.When someone uses the Internet to do something positive, like learn something or make something or contact an old friend, they typically don't say a thing. Nobody talks about this. Everyone talks about all the negative uses. They capture our attention better.This bias is something that's probably been selected for through humanity's evolutionary history. There's a saying: "if you mistake a bush for a lion, you're fine, but if you mistake a lion for a bush you're dead." You are the descendent of paranoid people who made the first mistake, not the second. Being hypervigilant about dangers is going to be adaptive on average in most environments.konart 2 minutes ago

At some point,
after the dot-com collapse but around the time of the Facebook IPO,
SF (and SV) started to attract people who cared more about the money than the tech itself.
Creating a software product was seen not as a goal in itself,
but as a means to make money.
The actual thing, SaaS, social network, shopping, trading, whatever,
didn't matter.
All that mattered was that it could make money,
the more the better.Of course for now the AI companies are bleeding money,
as it costs more per user than they charge,
but that will change as soon as they accomplish the necessary lock-in.uoaei 2 minutes ago

In tech circles there is a naive utopianism which comprises the "good intentions" currently paving the road to hell.I was just at a talk where they had "AI experts" judge a startup pitch for an AI call center company. None of them could admit that the obvious business model (bill the client based on number of tokens / seconds) would make customer outcomes much worse (by incentivizing the bot to keep the customer on the phone as long as possible and even encourage them to call back). But they refused to admit, or even consider, that business models can be exploitative and full of perverse incentives. These are people at the head of efforts at big-name tech companies and they're too caught up in the dazzle.They won't accept that they are the ones making an entire industry available to grifters by couching all their language in this hope-and-change idealism. Or maybe we're watching how otherwise well-intentioned people can become grifters when they aren't able to reflect on their goals and their actions.codyb 2 minutes ago

That sucks.I'm happy I moved away from advertising/other tech shit I don't agree with and found a position at a company whose work I respect.I really enjoy mentoring the younger engineers. And because all tech basically looks the same to me at this point (I.E. it's very rare I encounter a new pattern after 15 years of startups, personal projects, and big cos, and freelance) I spend a ton less time focused on learning and more time focused on creating opportunities for others.I'm also really thankful to have a mostly remote work style, opportunities to volunteer through work (and other events like game nights, happy hours), and a product people know and like.It is of course not all roses and sweet teas. Promotions are scarce, the stock's volatile, sometimes people can suck to work with, and the organization can be hard to work in due to complexity and coordination challenges. But that's okay, can't have it all I suppose.If I felt like you do... I'd... do something else I think, or look for a new gig. (Easier said than done I know). Hope you find some peace friendSmall idea: Have you looked outside of the Tech industry towards other areas where companies need tech workers?ameliaquining 2 minutes ago
