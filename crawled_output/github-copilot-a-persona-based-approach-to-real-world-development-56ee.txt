🚀 GitHub Copilot: A Persona-Based Approach to Real-World Development
#githubcopilot

If you’ve ever used GitHub Copilot for more than a quick boilerplate snippet, you’ve probably felt this: it’s brilliant… until it isn’t.
One moment, it autocompletes exactly what you need. The next, it’s confidently generating nonsense or doubling down on the worst coding pattern in your repo. You go from “this is magic” to “I could have written this faster myself” in a heartbeat.
Here’s the problem: most of us treat Copilot like a single, all-knowing assistant — a kind of coding oracle that should always “just get it.” But that’s not how real software teams work. In real projects, you don’t expect one developer to gather requirements, design the architecture, write every line of code, debug the tricky parts, and then review their own work. That would be a recipe for burnout (and bugs).
So why do we expect Copilot to do exactly that?
After months of experimenting I found a better way: stop treating Copilot as one helper, and start treating it like a team.
Just like a real software team has product managers, architects, engineers, and reviewers, I’ve built a flow where Copilot plays these roles through personas. Combined with solid repo guardrails (instructions that act like Copilot’s onboarding docs), this transforms Copilot from a “wild card junior dev” into a reliable partner I can actually trust in production code.
In this article, I’ll share my exact flow, from setting up repo instructions, to defining personas, to switching between them in Visual Studio Code chat modes.
🛠️ Why Instructions Matter
Imagine onboarding a brand-new senior developer to your repo.
Would you just say:
“Hey, here’s the codebase — good luck!”
Of course not. You’d spend time explaining the project’s purpose, quirks, architecture patterns, and the “landmines” they should avoid. Without that context, even the best dev will fall into the repo’s worst habits.
That’s exactly how GitHub Copilot works, too. If you drop it into your project cold, it happily mirrors the ugliest code it can find — and it does so confidently.
That’s where repo instructions come in. Think of them as Copilot’s onboarding guide. Instead of guessing, Copilot gets a clear description of:
What the project is about
Which patterns to follow
Which patterns to avoid
Where things live in the repo
📄 My Setup: copilot-instructions.md
I always start a new project by creating a copilot-instructions.md file in an empty folder. This file becomes Copilot’s playbook — guardrails + quick context.
Here’s an excerpt from my Teams Status Manager project:
## Project Overview
**Teams Status Manager**: Create/Edit/Delete reusable Teams status templates, apply on demand, and schedule updates.
**Stack**: .NET 9 Minimal API • React (TypeScript, Vite) • SQL Server • Microsoft Graph SDK • Quartz.NET
**Auth Flow**: SPA → API (custom scope) → On-Behalf-Of (OBO) → Microsoft Graph (`Presence.ReadWrite`)
## Architecture Patterns
### Backend (.NET 9 Minimal API)
- **Endpoints**: Located in `src/backend/TeamsStatusManager.Api/Endpoints/` - separate files per feature
- **Services**: Interface/implementation pattern in `Services/` folder
- **Validation**: FluentValidation validators in `Validators/` folder
- **Jobs**: Quartz.NET jobs in `Jobs/` folder with SQL job store
- **Data**: EF Core entities in `TeamsStatusManager.Data/Entities/`
### Frontend (React + TypeScript)
- **Auth**: MSAL React in `src/auth/` with `AuthProvider.tsx` wrapper
- **Data Fetching**: TanStack Query hooks in `src/hooks/` (co-located with features)
- **Forms**: react-hook-form + zod schemas
- **Components**: Feature-based folders in `src/components/`

This file tells Copilot how we build things here. Instead of randomly generating code, it aligns with the same architectural rules every teammate would follow.
⚡ The Workflow
I create the copilot-instructions.md file.
I use Claude Sonnet 4 with the /new command to scaffold the project based on these guardrails.
I then ask Copilot to generate the VS Code tasks for launching the solution.
👥 Step 2: Work Like a Team of Personas
Even with solid repo instructions, I realized I was still making the same mistake: treating Copilot like a single developer who could do everything — gather requirements, design the solution, implement it, and then debug it.
That’s not how real teams work. In a real project, you’d have:
A product manager clarifying requirements
An architect designing the solution
Engineers writing the code
Reviewers making sure everything matches the spec
And, of course, someone to fix things when they inevitably break
So why not work with Copilot the same way?
That’s when I shifted to a persona-based approach. Instead of one Copilot, I now have several specialized Copilot personas I can “switch into” depending on what stage of development I’m in.
🧑‍💼 Core Personas
Product Manager → Gathers requirements, writes user stories, and clarifies acceptance criteria.
Software Architect → Produces a technical specification (step-by-step plan, no code).
Engineer → Implements the code following the spec.
🔧 Special Personas
Problem Solver (Mr. Wolf 🐺) → Debugs tricky issues and comes up with fixes.
Tech Spec Reviewer → Reviews the architecture for scalability, performance, and edge cases.
Implementation Reviewer → Reviews the actual implementation against the spec.
Each persona has its own prompt (I’ll share mine later in this article) and its own strengths.
💬 Adding Chat Modes in VS Code
Now here’s the best part: you don’t have to copy-paste prompts every time you want to switch personas. Visual Studio Code lets you add custom chat modes so you can jump straight into “Product Manager mode” or “Mr. Wolf mode” with a single click.
Here’s how to set them up:
Open the Copilot Chat panel in VS Code.
Click the “+” button next to Chat Modes.
Give your mode a clear name (e.g., Software Architect).
Paste your persona prompt into the configuration.
Save it.
Now, whenever you want Copilot to act as your architect, product manager, or problem solver, you just switch modes. No re-prompting. No forgetting context.
Example:
I’m gathering requirements → I switch to Product Manager.
Designing the system → I switch to Architect.
Debugging a weird async issue → I bring in Mr. Wolf.
It feels less like talking to “an AI” and more like leading a team of specialists inside your IDE.
⚙️ Step 3: The Workflow in Action
With repo instructions in place and personas ready to go, the development process feels less like prompting an AI and more like coordinating a small dev team. Each stage has its own “owner,” and Copilot stays focused instead of drifting into random guesses.
Here’s how my workflow looks in practice:
1. Gathering Requirements (Product Manager Persona)
I start with the Product Manager persona, which turns vague feature ideas into clear product requirements.
It writes user stories with acceptance criteria.
It forces me to clarify edge cases.
If details are missing, it asks questions like a real PM would.
For each feature, the Product Manager creates a PRD file inside the docs folder ( e.g., docs/save-data-prd.md)
This step keeps me from rushing into implementation before I actually know what “done” looks like.
2. Designing the Solution (Software Architect Persona)
Once requirements are set, I switch to the Software Architect persona.
It creates a technical specification: step-by-step instructions for how the feature should be implemented.
It doesn’t write code — instead, it documents exactly where changes go and how components should interact.
If something is unclear, it flags it for clarification.
For each feature, the Software architect creates a techspec file inside the docs folder  (e.g., docs/save-data-techspec.md)
This is where Copilot stops guessing and starts working from a concrete plan.
3. Implementing the Feature (Engineer Persona)
Now I bring in the Engineer persona.
It follows the technical specification step by step.
If it skips something, I prompt it to review its own work and fill in the gaps.
Since it’s working inside the guardrails of the repo instructions + tech spec, the code aligns with my architecture from the start.
This is where the productivity gains really show: Copilot writes the code, but it does so inside the framework I’ve already defined.
4. Debugging and Testing (Special Personas)
Inevitably, something doesn’t work as expected. That’s when I switch to the special personas:
Mr. Wolf (Problem Solver) → Like the fixer in Pulp Fiction, he jumps in when something breaks. Example prompt:
“The homepage isn’t updating the user’s status after login. It should show the profile photo in the header. Fix it.”
Tech Spec Reviewer → Double-checks the architecture before implementation.
Looks for scalability issues, missing edge cases, or race conditions.
Implementation Reviewer → Validates that the code matches the spec.
Lists issues in order of severity.
Suggests fixes without rewriting everything.
These personas save me from the endless loop of “generate → test → sigh → tweak → repeat.” Instead, Copilot becomes my QA safety net.
By moving through these stages, I’m not just “asking Copilot to code.” I’m leading a structured process where AI acts as different team members with specific responsibilities.
The result? More reliable code, fewer detours, and a workflow that feels like working with a real team instead of fighting with autocomplete.
🧩 Example: Teams Status Manager Project
To make this less abstract, let’s walk through how I applied this flow to a real-world project: Teams Status Manager.
The goal was simple on paper:
Create, edit, and delete reusable Teams status templates. Apply them on demand or schedule updates automatically.
But as every developer knows, “simple on paper” often hides a lot of moving parts. Here’s how the persona-based approach + repo instructions played out.
📝 Step 1: Repo Instructions
I started with the copilot-instructions.md file.
It outlined the project’s purpose, stack, and architecture guardrails.
That meant Copilot knew upfront:
Backend is .NET 9 Minimal API, not MVC.
Validation lives in FluentValidation classes.
Jobs use Quartz.NET with a SQL job store.
Frontend auth flows through MSAL React.
Data fetching happens with TanStack Query.
Without this, Copilot would have happily mixed patterns, invented new folders, or stuffed logic into the wrong places. With instructions, it already felt “trained” on my project.
🧑‍💼 Step 2: Personas in Action
Product Manager: Turned “status templates with scheduling” into user stories with acceptance criteria. For example:
As a user, I can schedule a status change so that my Teams presence updates automatically during a meeting.
Software Architect: Designed the flow:
Store templates in SQL via EF Core entities.
Use Quartz.NET jobs for scheduling.
Trigger Microsoft Graph Presence.ReadWrite calls through an OBO flow.
Engineer: Implemented the API endpoints and React hooks following that exact plan.
Mr. Wolf: Debugged a nasty bug where scheduled jobs weren’t firing after a server restart. Copilot eventually suggested a SQL-backed job store for Quartz.NET — which fixed it.
Reviewers: Double-checked the spec and code against the requirements, catching edge cases like: what happens if two jobs overlap?
⚡ The Result
Instead of Copilot generating “whatever it thinks is right,” it worked like a real dev team:
The PM persona kept requirements sharp.
The Architect persona made the design consistent.
The Engineer persona implemented without freelancing.
Mr. Wolf + Reviewers caught issues before they slipped into production.
By the end, I didn’t just have code that compiled — I had a solution aligned with my architecture and ready for real users.
🌟 Benefits of the Persona Approach
After months of experimenting, this persona-based approach has completely changed how I work with GitHub Copilot. Instead of “sometimes brilliant, sometimes frustrating,” it’s become a consistent partner I can trust in real-world projects.
Here’s why this works so well:
✅ 1. Structure Beats Chaos
Without personas, Copilot tries to do everything at once — requirements, design, code, debugging — and usually cuts corners. By assigning roles, you bring structure to the interaction. Copilot knows its job, just like a human teammate would.
✅ 2. Repo Guardrails = Consistency
The copilot-instructions.md file is the onboarding doc for every AI assistant that touches the repo. No matter the model, the architecture stays consistent. This reduces those “why is there a random utils folder now?” moments.
✅ 3. Faster Iteration, Less Frustration
Instead of wrestling with Copilot when it goes off track, you just switch personas.
Need clarity? Switch to Product Manager.
Designing? Switch to Architect.
Debugging? Call in Mr. Wolf.
This saves hours of context-switching and re-prompting.
✅ 4. Built-In Quality Control
Most devs don’t ask Copilot to review its own output. With the Tech Spec Reviewer and Implementation Reviewer, you get a built-in safety net. They don’t just rubber-stamp — they catch scalability issues, race conditions, and missed steps before they land in your code.
✅ 5. Scales with Complexity
On a small feature, maybe you only need PM → Architect → Engineer. On a complex enterprise flow, you can bring in reviewers and problem solvers. The model scales like a team would: add more specialists as the project grows.
Takeaways
GitHub Copilot is often marketed as an “AI pair programmer,” but if you expect it to be a single, all-knowing coding partner, you’ll eventually hit the wall of frustration. The real breakthrough comes when you stop treating Copilot as one assistant and start treating it as a team.
By combining:
Repo instructions → your project’s onboarding doc and guardrails
Personas → specialized roles for requirements, design, implementation, debugging, and review
Chat modes in VS Code → quick persona switching without re-prompting
…Copilot transforms from a wildcard into a structured, reliable collaborator.
For me, this approach turned Copilot from “a tool I sometimes fight with” into “a dev team I lead.”

This is one of the most grounded takes I’ve seen on Copilot usage. Treating it like a monolithic “oracle” is exactly what leads to frustration and misalignment. The persona-based approach mirrors how real teams operate and that shift from “autocomplete” to “collaborative tooling” is where the real leverage begins.
The repo instructions concept is gold. I’ve used similar onboarding docs for junior devs, but never thought to formalize it for Copilot. Definitely stealing that.
Curious how you manage persona switching in practice do you use prompt templates or workspace-specific chat setups

Thanks for the feedback!
For changing the persona, I just switch the chat mode in the Copilot Chat... and it changes also the model for the persona, automatically!

You're welcome on the tip, it's genuinely useful for getting the most out of GitHub Copilot and fine-tuning it to better align with our specific development workflows. The more precise and context-aware our prompts are, the more accurate and relevant the suggestions become, which ultimately boosts productivity and code quality.
On top of that, you might want to check out the community-driven GitHub repository called Awesome Copilot. It's a well-maintained collection of ready-to-use prompts, custom instructions, and predefined chat modes designed to optimize interactions with Copilot. Whether you're looking for boilerplate generation, debugging assistance, or even domain-specific patterns like API design or test writing, chances are someone's already crafted a solid starting point there.
What makes it even better is that everything is open and customizable. You can fork it, adapt the prompts to your stack, and integrate them directly into your IDE or CI/CD pipelines. Leveraging such resources not only saves time but also helps standardize best practices across teams. Definitely worth a look if you're serious about supercharging your coding experience with AI.
