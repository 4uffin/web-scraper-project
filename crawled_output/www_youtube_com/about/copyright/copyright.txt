YouTube is designed to ensure that every player in our ecosystem

How YouTubeâs Copyright Protection Tools work
Weâve invested millions of dollars in developing a Copyright
Management Suite thatâs designed to balance the needs of our
entire ecosystem â and we have clear rules when it comes to
copyright.
YouTube has worked directly with rightsholders to ensure that
copyrighted material on our platform is authorized, and we
provide those robust tools to allow rightsholders to notify
YouTube of alleged infringement, which we remove in accordance
with the law. There are three main tools that make up our
Copyright Management Suite:
Webform
Who is it for?
Available in more than 80 languages, all
rightsholders have access to the webform, which
weâve built as a streamlined and efficient way
to submit copyright removal requests.
What does it do?
Rightsholders enter a few details of their
request, which is then reviewed by YouTube to
see if it meets legal requirements for removing
the reported content.
Rights holders have access to powerful features,
including the ability to ask YouTube to
automatically prevent copies of the removed
content from being reuploaded.
Copyright Match Tool
Whoâs it for?
It helps creators and rights holders protect
their content by automatically finding videos
that are the same or very similar to ones
previously uploaded.
What does it do?
If a match is found, the creator or the rights
holder is notified. She can then review the
video that potentially reused their content and
decide whether to request the videoâs removal.
Content ID
Whoâs it for?
Rightsholders who have the most complex rights
management needs and experience heavy reposting
of copyrighted material, like movie studios and
music labels.
What does it do?
Rightsholders can pre-determine rules for when
content matches are found â choosing to block a
whole video from being viewed, monetize the
video by running ads against it, or track the
videoâs viewership stats.

How YouTube Addresses Copyright Claims Appeals
The majority of copyright claims and removal requests on
YouTube come from our automatic detection technology.
We empower uploaders to report wrongful takedown requests, and
we measure how often creators push back against
removals
and
Content ID claims
in our
Copyright Transparency Report.
Of the more than 1 billion Content ID claims made between July
2023 and December 2023, fewer than 1% have been disputed. Over
65% of those disputes succeeded, because claimants either
voluntarily released the claim or did not respond within the
30-day window, resulting in the claimâs release. (Source)
