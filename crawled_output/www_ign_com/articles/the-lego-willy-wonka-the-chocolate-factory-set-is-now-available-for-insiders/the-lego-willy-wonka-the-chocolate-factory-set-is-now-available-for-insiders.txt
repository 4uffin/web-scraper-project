If you’re not an insider, you can sign up here for free and purchase it early. It’s a big, fun, candy-colored set that re-creates the most iconic scene in the movie. Buy it before Wednesday, September 17, and you’ll also get the LEGO SEGA Genesis Controller set for free. That set is a Gift With Purchase, and is not available to buy separately.LEGO Ideas Willy Wonka and the Chocolate FactoryLEGO Ideas Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory66$219.99 at LEGO StoreAnother good reason to pick up the Wonka set now, if you want it, is because it may go out of stock. The LEGO Captain Jack Sparrow’s Pirate Ship set just came out of early access today, and it’s already back-ordered to next month. These sought-after sets don’t always stay readily available past the Insiders’ early access window.But back to Wonka. It’s a marvelous 2,025-piece set that has you build the main room in the Chocolate Factory. It has a bridge over the chocolate river, the Wonkatania boat, a chocolate waterfall that moves when you turn a dial, Wonka’s office, candy flowers, and more. We had the chance to build this set ourselves and it's just as wild as it looks.Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory LEGO SetView 6 ImagesIt also comes with nine minifigures, including Willy Wonka, Charlie Bucket, Grandpa Joe, Augusutus Gloop, Mike Teavee, Veruca Salt, Violet Beauregarde, and two Oompa Loompa figures. The $219.99 price tag isn’t too steep for a licensed set, either. It breaks down to about $0.11 per piece, which is right in line with most other sets.Jumping back to the Genesis Controller GWP that comes free with this set, it’s a pretty great little build in its own right. It’s nearly a 1:1 scale re-creation of the classic, original three-button controller. It even has an adorable little Sonic the Hedgehog scene from the Green Hill Zoe hidden inside of it as an easter egg. You can do an alternate build that puts that scene on the back of the controller, making it viewable from the display stand. It's worth noting that the Genesis controller isn't specifically tied to the Wonka set; it comes for free with any purchase of $129.99 or more at LEGO Store.New LEGO Sets for SeptemberLEGO Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse Minifigures60$4.99 at LEGO StoreLEGO Batman: Arkham Asylum48$299.99 at LEGO StoreLEGO Star Wars Advent Calendar 202524$44.99 at AmazonLEGO Harry Potter Advent Calendar 202525$44.99 at AmazonLEGO Minecraft Advent Calendar 202538$44.99 at AmazonLEGO Disney Frozen Advent Calendar 202511$44.99 at AmazonLEGO City Advent Calendar 20256$34.99 at AmazonLEGO Friends Advent Calendar 20255$34.99 at AmazonLEGO Harry Potter Hogsmeade Village – Collectors' Edition36$399.99 at LEGO StoreLEGO Disney & Pixar Wall-E & EVE74$69.96 at AmazonLEGO Wicked Emerald City & Kiamo Ko Castle5$79.99 at AmazonLEGO Nike Dunk Trickshot32$39.99 at LEGO StoreLEGO Icons Captain Jack Sparrow's Pirate Ship16$379.99 at LEGO StoreLEGO Ideas Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory66$219.99 at LEGO StoreSeptember has been a killer month for LEGO releases, with major builds like LEGO Batman Arkham Asylum, a bunch of new 2025 LEGO advent calendars, and a gorgeous new collector’s edition of Hogsmeade Village from Harry Potter.
