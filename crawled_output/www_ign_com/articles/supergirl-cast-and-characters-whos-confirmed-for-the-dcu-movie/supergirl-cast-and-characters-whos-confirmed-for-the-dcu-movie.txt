Supergirl is based on Tom King and Bilquis Evely’s 2021-2022 comic book series, Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow, and will be a “space fantasy” that will have a different tone than Superman. While we still have a lot more to learn about the upcoming DCU film, we are starting to learn who will be joining Kara in the film, and we’re here to break that all down for you!Supergirl Cast and Characters: Who's Confirmed for the DCU Movie?View 9 ImagesMilly Alcock as Supergirl / Kara Zor-ElAs previously mentioned, Milly Alcock will star as Kara Zor-El in Supergirl, and James Gunn has already shared that Superman’s cousin is a “mess. She’s a total mess.” “I mean, I think as we learn, she's had a completely different background from Superman,” Gunn continued. “A much more difficult background. He's had this wonderful upbringing by these two parents that loved him and were very healthy. And her background was much different than that. And she's ended up different than her cousin.”Kara was on a piece of Krypton that drifted away from the planet, and she had to live there for the first 14 years of her life. According to Gunn, she was in a “horrible situation where she watched everyone around her die. So, she’s a much harsher and more f*cked up Supergirl than you’ve been used to thus far.”Supergirl first appeared in Action Comics #252 (May 1959).KryptoWe will most likely be seeing much more of the wonderfully chaotic Krypto, as we discover in Superman that she is actually Supergirl’s dog, and Superman was just watching over him while she was gone. This was when we also learned, via Kal-El, that Kara “likes to go and party on other planets. Planets with red suns. Because of our metabolism, we can’t get drunk on a planet with a yellow sun.”All of this explains why Krypto sometimes acts the way he does while also being a wonderful dog, and we should learn more about him in Supergirl.Krypto first appeared in Adventure Comics #210 (March 1955).Jason Momoa as LoboAfter starring as Aquaman in the DCEU, Jason Momoa will officially join the DCU as Lobo in Supergirl. Lobo was always Momoa’s favorite character, and he had previously stated it would be “the perfect role” for him. Soon, we’ll get to see that dream come true. Lobo is an interstellar mercenary and bounty hunter with superhuman strength and immortality, and he was first introduced in Omega Men #3 (June 1983).Matthias Schoenaerts as Krem of the Yellow HillsMatthias Schoenaerts Image Credit: Vittorio Zunino Celotto/Getty ImagesVia Deadline, Rust and Bone’s Matthias Schoenaerts is set to portray the big villain of Supergirl, Krem of the Yellow Hills. Krem was the main antagonist in King and Evely’s Supergirl comic that serves as the film’s source material, and his actions very well may lead to Supergirl joining the party. Eve Ridley as Ruthye Marye KnollEve Ridley Image Credit: Jeff Kravitz/Getty Images for NetflixVia Deadline, 3 Body Problem’s Eve Ridley will take on the role of Ruthye Marye Knoll. In the comics, Knoll is a noble and honorable warrior, and one of the key people who draws Supergirl into a conflict we won’t spoil here in case it is adapted from the comics to the big screen.David Krumholtz as Zor-ElDavid Krumholtz Image Credit: Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty ImagesVia THR, Supergirl will be a family affair, as Oppenheimer’s David Krumholtz will be playing Kara Zor-El’s father, Zor-El. Emily Beecham as Alura In-ZeEmily Beecham Image Credit: Jeff Spicer/Getty ImagesVia THR, 1899’s Emily Beecham will play Supergirl’s mother, Alura In-Ze. If the post-credits scene of Superman is any indication, Alura and Zor-El probably have their hands full with Kara! Will David Corenswet’s Superman Appear in Supergirl?While nothing has been confirmed, it could make a lot of sense for David Corenswet’s Superman to appear in Supergirl. We still have a lot to learn about their relationship as cousins, as well as more about Krypton’s past, so an appearance by good ol’ Kal-El very well may be in the cards!Adam Bankhurst is a writer for IGN.
