WonderSuper Mario Bros. Wonder - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Meetup in Bellabel ParkNintendo Fans Spot Unannounced Character in Mario Bros. Wonder Switch 2 TrailerSpace for one more?Super Mario Bros. Wonder's upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 Edition was announced last week — but now fans believe Nintendo may have accidentally revealed more than intended. Pause the Switch 2 Edition's trailer at the 2:01 mark and a mini-game icon can clearly be seen featuring the character of Rosalina, Nintendo's space princess originally introduced in the Super Mario Galaxy games. Rosalina is not present in the original Super Mario Bros. Wonder, available on Switch, but her presence in the game's upcoming Switch 2 Edition would make sense considering the huge push for Galaxy content that Nintendo is currently prepping for next year.Officially titled Super Mario Bros Wonder: Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Meetup in Bellabel Park, the upgraded version of Nintendo's platformer will contain a suite of additional multiplayer games. Indeed, it's this Bellabel Park plaza that can be seen in the trailer, showcasing a challenge with Rosalina and Yoshi on its icon (as spotted on social media by Nintendo fan DynamoSuperX). During the trailer, Nintendo also teased further additions coming to the Switch 2 version of Wonder, but said it would detail these at a later date. Could this include a new selection of levels with a Galaxy theme, to tie into Rosalina's apparent inclusion? Time will tell. Rosalina can be seen on this in-game icon within Super Mario Bros. Wonder's Switch 2 Edition.Next year will see Nintendo returning to its beloved Mario Galaxy games in a big way, with expanded ports of both Mario Galaxy and Galaxy 2 for Switch 2 ($70 for the pair, or $40 each) and even a physical version of Rosalina's in-game storybook to buy. All of this will then lead into the launch of The Super Mario Galaxy Movie, the follow-up to Nintendo and Universal's first hit Mario film. A teaser for that, also aired during the Nintendo Direct, strongly hinted that Rosalina would soon be introduced on the big screen, too."Super Mario Bros. Wonder establishes a new standard for what 2D Mario platformers should look like," IGN wrote in our review, scoring the game a 9/10. "It is colorful, it is alive, and it is joyful. It also managed to surprise and delight me in continually more creative ways thanks to its unpredictable Wonder Effects, which transform levels into something completely different for a brief while."Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
