One of the best deals I've seen so far is on this Alienware Aurora R16 gaming PC equipped with the excellent Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti graphics card. You can get it starting at just $1,499.99 after a $600 instant discount. Free delivery is included. The RTX 5070 Ti graphics card can run any game at 60fps even in 4K.Alienware Aurora R16 RTX 5070 Ti Gaming PC for $1,499.99Alienware Aurora R16 Intel Core Ultra 7 265F RTX 5070 Ti Gaming PC (16GB/1TB)11$2,099.99 save 17%$1,749.99 at AlienwareLiquid CooledAlienware Aurora R16 Intel Core Ultra 7 265F RTX 5070 Ti Gaming PC (16GB/1TB)1$2,149.99 save 29%$1,519.99 at AlienwareThe base configuration is equipped with an Intel Core Ultra 7 265F processor, GeForce RTX 5070 Ti 16GB graphics card, 16GB of DDR5-5600MHz RAM, and a 1TB M.2 SSD. The system is powered by a 1000W 80Plus Platinum power supply. Note that this is a customizable system, so you can upgrade the CPU, cooling, RAM, and storage.The Core Ultra 7 265F is part of Intel's newest Arrow Lake-S lineup released earlier this year and boasts a max turbo frequency of 5.3GHz with 20 cores and a 36MB L2 cache. This is a great all-around CPU for gaming, multi-tasking, and general workstation performance. It doesn't have as many cores as a Core Ultra 9 processor, but that doesn't matter for gaming since the vast majority of games will not be able to utilize more than 20 cores. By default the processor is air cooled by a tower heatsink and fan combo, but you can upgrade to 240mm all-in-one liquid cooling for an extra $20.The RTX 5070 Ti GPU Has Excellent 4K Gaming PerformanceOf all the Blackwell cards released thus far, the RTX 5070 Ti offers the best bang for your buck, especially when pitted against the previous generation GPUs. It performs neck-and-neck with the RTX 4080 Super and marginalizes the RTX 5080, which is only about 10%-15% faster but costs 33% more. Like all Blackwell cards, the RTX 5070 Ti supports DLSS 4 with multi-frame generation.
This GPU is capable of high framerates in nearly all games, even at 4K resolution. If you plan on using this card for AI, the RTX 5070 Ti may be a better value since it has the same amount of VRAM as the RTX 5080.Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti GPU Review by Jacqueline Thomas"At $749, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is the best 4K graphics card for most people, delivering much better value than either the RTX 5080 or 5090. Across my entire test suite, this GPU soared at 4K, coming within striking distance of much more expensive graphics cards, and that’s before taking multi frame generation into account, which will make the RTX 5070 Ti even better at hitting extremely high framerates, albeit with a hit to latency."Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.
