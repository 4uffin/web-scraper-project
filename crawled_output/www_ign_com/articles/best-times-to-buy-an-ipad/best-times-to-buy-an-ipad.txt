It's perfect for new and upcoming artists, great for taking notes in class, amazing as a reading tablet, and can even be used as a makeshift laptop with the right accessories. The possibilities are truly endless. With a device so useful, you can expect a pay a premium, naturally. Luckily, there are multiple times during the year when you can score an iPad at a discounted price.If you wait for major holidays or sales events, you can sometimes save up to 50% off a brand-new iPad. It can be tricky to determine when to pull the trigger on a major purchase like this, so we've compiled the best times to buy an iPad below to make things as easy as possible. As we head into the various sales events for 2025, keep an eye out for Apple deals on the best iPad models.Best Times to Buy an iPadWhen New Models ReleaseBy far, the best time to buy a new iPad is right around or after the release of new models. Retailers tend to carry two generations of iPads at a time, so they elect to offload the oldest generation as soon as a new one releases. So, you can save big on iPad, iPad Air, and even iPad Pro if you elect to purchase just after or before the new models release.This timing can be tricky, though. Different iPad models have different release dates throughout the year, so it is important to pay attention to when new generations of specific models are released. If you want an iPad Pro, you can't expect to buy one at a discount when the new iPad Air models release.The most recent release of the new iPad and iPad Air mean that prices on the previous generations of these will continue to drop later this year. You can expect those discount any time between now and Black Friday.Prime Big Deal DaysThe next big sale where we expect to see discounts on iPads is Amazon's Prime Big Deal Days sale in October. This is a Prime-exclusive event only available to those with an Amazon Prime membership, but any discounts Amazon has will likely also be available at other retailers like Best Buy and Walmart. Amazon has announced the dates for the sale as October 7-8 this year.Black Friday and Cyber MondayOne of the overall best times to purchase an iPad is Black Friday. Online retailers like Amazon will have iPad deals, with discounts likely available even for this year's models. Some deals will be limited time discounts, while others will run across the length of the sale. As we get closer to Black Friday and Cyber Monday, you can expect to see Apple offering a bonus with new iPad purchases, most likely a free Apple gift card.New Year'sThe start of the year right around New Year's is another fantastic time to pick up a new iPad. Here, Apple and other retailers tend to attempt to offload leftover inventory after the busy holiday season. Therefore, it's easy to score major deals on devices like iPads. For the most part, you should not expect to see major discounts on current generation models, but older models are always discounted at rates up to 60%. If you miss the holiday sales, this is the next best option, and you will not have to wait long after.Amazon Prime DayAlthough Prime Day isn't as good as Black Friday for iPad deals, it is still one of the best times of the year to buy one. Amazon always discounts various iPad models during its two-day shopping event, making it one of the most consistent windows to find a good deal on an Apple tablet. This year, Amazon even had discounts on the newest iPad models, though the price cuts weren't that steep.Back to School PromotionsMany times, retailers will offer massive discounts on Apple iPads during August right before school begins for many, which makes this a great time to buy an iPad. Since many students, especially in college, use iPads frequently, Apple usually will discount select iPad models for a few weeks in August leading up to schooling. If you or someone you know is a student, you can even score a student exclusive discount to save more money on a shiny new iPad.While the end of summer might be an inconvenient time to buy an iPad, this is a surefire way of saving money. This year, Apple added a free $100 gift card with any purchase of an iPad Pro, so you can expect something similar nect year more or less as well as additional discounts from Labor Day sales.New iPads Available in 2025Apple's most recently released iPad models include: a refresh of the iPad Air and the new 11th generation iPad. The M3 iPad Air, which starts at $599, and a new 11th-generation baseline iPad, which starts at $349. These are more spec-bump updates rather than major overhauls, but they’re the new 2025 models and they’re more powerful than their predecessors, so they’re probably the ones to get if you’re in the market for a new Apple tablet.
