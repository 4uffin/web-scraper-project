The Boys spin-off aired its first season in 2023, introducing us to a particularly hormonal new generation of supes attending their first year at God U. Now we follow the gang as they head into their sophomore year, which, from personal experience, is when you can really start doing things for the plot. If you’re tuning into the new season, here’s when you can expect new episodes. Everything You Need to Know to Watch Gen V Season 2Gen V0From the world of The Boys comes Gen V, a thrilling new series set at America’s only college for superheroes.See it at Prime VideoGen V continues to stream exclusively on Prime Video, which is included in general Amazon Prime memberships alongside a pretty wide spread of perks (including free shipping). Amazon also recently rolled out a new Prime for Young Adults plan with a 50% discount for anyone between the ages of 18 and 24. New episodes of Gen V’s second season will arrive on Prime Video every Wednesday. While the first three episodes dropped all at once on September 17, subsequent episodes will be released one at a time. These episodes will become available to stream at 12am PT/3am ET, so you could theoretically pull a late night on Tuesday to watch them. Here’s the full release schedule for this season, which will include eight episodes total: Episode Release Schedule Episode 1: “New Year, New U” - September 17Episode 2: “Justice Never Forgets” - September 17Episode 3: “H is for Human” - September 17 Episode 4: TBA - September 24Episode 5: TBA - October 1Episode 6: TBA - October 8Episode 7: TBA - October 15Episode 8: TBA - October 22IGN’s review of Gen V’s second season describes a slow start, but that “the series only improves as it moves forward and deepens the drama for Marie and her circle of wannabe superhero friends.” Jesse Schedeen’s review also hints at a Homelander-like villain, so that’s terrifying. But, thankfully, our protagonist Marie seems to be getting some serious power-scaling. The show also returns after the tragic passing of star Chance Perdomo, who is given a deserved tribute in the new season. Who’s your favorite character on Gen V?SamEmmaMarieJordanCateAndreAnswerSee ResultsHow Does Season 2 Line Up With The Boys? Season 1 of Gen V took place after Season 3 of The Boys, and the spin-off’s second season follows The Boys Season 4. The time skip is a bit larger here, though, with the second season kicking off over a year after the most recent episode of The Boys. We have no confirmation about a third season for Gen V quite yet, but I wouldn’t be surprised if these worlds collide in the final season of The Boys, slated for 2026.
