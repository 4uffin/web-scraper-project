Instead of waiting to contribute to Apple's coffers, I instead opted to pick up a pair of Baseus Bass BP1 Pro earbuds during the Amazon Prime Day Sale back in July. I paid a little more than what it's priced at today (all three colors are $19.59 for Prime members with coupon code "X6F6U5M6"), but I still came away thoroughly impressed. They're not $250 good, but they sound a lot better than what you'd expect from an expendable pair of $20 earbuds.Baseus BP1 Pro Wireless Noise Canceling Earbuds for $19.59Amazon Prime Member ExclusiveBaseus Bass BP1 Pro Noise Cancelling Wireless Earbuds1$39.99 save 51%$19.59 at AmazonUse code 'X6F6U5M6'First of all, the AirPods Pro is great. My wife still uses the first generation Lightning model. Unsurprisingly, it is a superior earbud to the Baseus BP1 Pro. It sounds better, it has more effective noise canceling performance, and perhaps most importantly, it pairs seamlessly with her iPhone. However, the BP1 Pro is not that far off. It's certainly not 12x worse.Like the AirPods Pro, this is a truly wireless earbud with built-in active noise cancelation. It's designed to sit in your ear and seal it off passively. There are five eartips included for different sized ears (I am a small person but I have a big head and big ears). This design alone makes it, in my opinion, better than the non-pro version of the AirPods 3, which doesn't provide a seal at all. Sound quality is quite good and, true to its name, it does a pretty decent job of simulating real bass. The noise cancelation works, but don't expect top-of-the-line performance. For example, even though ambient sounds were more muffled, I could still hold a conversation even with ANC turned on. To be fair, I get the same experience with the AirPods Pro and only experience really effective noise cancelation with a good pair of over-ear headphones. The BP1 Pro does have a transparency mode option, if instead you actually do want to listen to your surroundings.Because the Baseus BP1 Pro is a recent release (it came out earlier this year), it features the latest Bluetooth 6.0 protocol. For non-Apple users, it supports Bluetooth Multipoint, which allows you to pair to two devices simultaneously. It's IP55 rated, which means it resists "water jets" and dust intrusion. The rating is better than the AirPods Pro 2 (IP54) but not as good as the AirPods Pro 3 (IP57). The earbuds last up to 12 hours with ANC off (7 hours with ANC on) but the charging case extends it to 55 hours (and 36 hours).For a low, low price of $20 (the cost of a burrito in my neck of the woods), you're not risking very much to try these out, especially considering the fact that Amazon offers a hassle-free 30-day return policy. In fact, if you were eying the AirPods Pro 3 but ended up perfectly content with these earbuds, then pat yourself on the back because you just saved $230.How to Follow IGN Deals RecommendationsThe IGN Deals team has over 30 years of combined experience finding the best discounts and preorders available online.
