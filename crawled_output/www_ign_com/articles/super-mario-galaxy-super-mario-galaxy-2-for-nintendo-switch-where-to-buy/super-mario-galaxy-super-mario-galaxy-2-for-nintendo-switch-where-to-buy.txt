If it does at some point in the future, or if any retailer decides to offer a bonus of its own, I'll add it here.What Is Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2?These are ports of Nintendo Wii games. Super Mario Galaxy hit the waggly platform in 2007. The sequel arrived on the same console in 2010. Both games were incredibly well received: IGN gave Super Mario Galaxy a 9.7/10 and Super Mario Galaxy 2 a 10/10. Both games have gotten some upgrades and improvements in their transition to the new platform. They have improved resolution (up to 4K on Switch 2), a better UI, and a new in-game music player. You also have the option to play using standard controls, or using the Joy-Cons in a more Wii-like manner with motion controls.In addition to the improvements, Rosalina's in-game storybook is also getting new pages. We’ll have to wait until the game comes out to see exactly what they’ll include.The crux of the original games is that Mario is sent into space, where he runs and jumps around on planetoid-like environments. Each one has its own gravitational pull, so you can run all around the spheres, making for some interesting platforming challenges. They really are superb games.Other Preorder GuidesCheck out everything else that was announced in the most recent Nintendo Direct or our ongoing list of upcoming video game release dates. 007 First Light Preorder Guide Battlefield 6 Preorder Guide Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Preorder Guide Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Mirror Edition Preorder Guide Dragon Quest I and II HD-2D Remake Preorder Guide Dragon Quest VII Reimagined Preorder Guide Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade (Switch, Xbox) Preorder Guide Ghost of Yotei Preorder Guide Hades 2 Preorder Guide Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment Preorder Guide Kirby Air Riders Preorder Guide Mario Tennis Fever Preorder Guide Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Preorder Guide Octopath Traveler 0 Preorder Guide Pokemon Legends Z-A Preorder Guide Silent Hill f Preorder Guide Super Mario Galaxy 1+2 Preorder Guide Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter Preorder Guide Chris Reed is a commerce editor and deals expert for IGN.
