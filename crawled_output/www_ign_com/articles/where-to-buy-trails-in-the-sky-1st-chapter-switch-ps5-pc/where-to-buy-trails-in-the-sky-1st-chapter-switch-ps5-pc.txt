So if you want it, the standard edition is your only option.What Is Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter?The original game, The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky, first released in Japan in 2004. It didn’t make its way to the West until 2011, when it came out here for PlayStation Portable. The game has two direct sequels, Trails in the Sky SC and Trails in the Sky the 3rd. The overarching Legend of Heroes series spans much more time, with entries releasing between the 1980s and now.Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter is a remake of the first entry in this sub-series. In it, you play as Estelle and Joshua, two Bracers-in-training who travel around the world, helping people in order to earn full Bracer status. The main overarching storyline revolves around the mystery of what happened to Estelle’s father, who has gone missing. The game is known for its many characters and many lines of dialogue. It’s sort of a relaxed, slow moving, hang-out game that verges on visual novel territory at times. It’s great.Instead of the PS1-style sprite-based graphics of the original, this remake features full 3D anime-style graphics that look basically like the Tales or Dragon Quest games. It looks pretty great, especially since the story of the original is so good. It will be nice to experience it with a more modern presentation. The original game is still available on Steam.Other Preorder Guides007 First Light Preorder Guide Battlefield 6 Preorder Guide Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Preorder Guide Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Mirror Edition Preorder Guide Dragon Quest I and II HD-2D Remake Preorder Guide Dragon Quest VII Reimagined Preorder Guide Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade (Switch, Xbox) Preorder Guide Ghost of Yotei Preorder Guide Hades 2 Preorder Guide Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment Preorder Guide Kirby Air Riders Preorder Guide Mario Tennis Fever Preorder Guide Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Preorder Guide Octopath Traveler 0 Preorder Guide Pokemon Legends Z-A Preorder Guide Silent Hill f Preorder Guide Super Mario Galaxy 1+2 Preorder Guide Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter Preorder Guide Chris Reed is a commerce editor and deals expert for IGN.
