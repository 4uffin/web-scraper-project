Pictures and Saga Arts have partnered with Fathom
Entertainment to release Trick ‘r Treat in theaters for two nights only: October 14 and 16, 2025. Tickets can be purchased at Fathom Entertainment.Although it screened at festivals and at San Diego Comic-Con, Trick ‘r Treat was never given a proper theatrical release, going straight-to-DVD and Blu-ray instead. The movie has become a beloved Halloween cult classic in the ensuing years.Trick ‘r Treat’s most iconic character is Sam, a trick-or-treater in orange footie pajamas who wears a burlap sack over his head. Fathom’s official press release describes Sam as “the
mischievous spirit who punishes anyone who dares to break the rules.” The official plot synopsis for the film follows: “Trick ‘r Treat weaves together sinister stories set on Halloween night: a high school principal, Dylan Baker (Spider-Man 2, Spider-Man 3) moonlights as a serial killer; a young virgin’s, Anna Paquin (X-Men franchise) search for the right man turns horrific; “Emma” Leslie Bibb (“The White Lotus”) and her husband discover the cost of ignoring holiday rituals; and a cantankerous old man, Brian Cox (“Succession”) faces Sam in a terrifying showdown. Darkly funny, gruesome, and endlessly rewatchable, Trick ’r Treat secures Sam’s place as the true spirit of Halloween.The re-release will be accompanied by a featurette on the development of the film, which was the feature directing debut of writer-director Michael Dougherty. Dougherty’s 1996 animated short, Season’s Greetings, which introduced Sam, will also be screened before the film. Season’s Greetings has also been restored in 4K.IGN reviewed Trick ‘r Treat out of San Diego Comic-Con 2009, awarding it an 8 out of 10 and proclaiming it “a scary blast.” We’ve since included the movie on many of our editorial lists, including it among the best werewolf movies of all time, the best holiday movies of all time, and the 25 best movies you didn’t see in theaters.In This ArticleTrick 'r TreatWarner Bros.
