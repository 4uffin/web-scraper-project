Compressed air canisters used to be the standard but nowadays there is a more versatile and cost effective solution. The Konpayde cordless electric air duster is on sale for a very reasonable $19.99 after you apply $20 off coupon code "BMIOXMIP". Most electric air dusters under $50 on Amazon are pretty much identical (most are rebadged X3 or X3 Mini air dusters), so if you're looking for an air duster in that general price range, I'd recommend just getting whichever one is least expensive. There are other more powerful options out there, but they are not as affordable.Konpayde Cordless Electric Air Duster for PC for $19.99Konpayde Cordless Electric Air Duster2$39.99 save 50%$19.99 at AmazonUse code 'BMIOXMIP'The Konpayde cordless rechargeable electric air duster is a fairly straightforward device. An internal fan spins at a very high RPM to move an appreciable amount of air through a relatively narrow nozzle, producing a tight, high-velocity stream that's more than strong enough to kick up layers of dust that's been sitting on top of your computer components. It has three speed settings, although I would recommend keeping it at the max speed for optimal results.
You also get three different sized nozzles, including a narrow funnel for tight spaces like the crevices in your keyboard and a wider nozzle for AoE damage. It also conveniently charges via USB Type-C.What's really, really special about this air duster is its RPM rating. Konpayde, as trustworthy as they sound, claims that the internal fan moves at 180,000RPM. No I did not add an extra zero by accident, but I'm pretty sure the manufacturer did. I didn't even think this was achievable in a typical air duster fan, let alone a $20 one. Either way, expect the power to be in line with other similarly priced dusters and certainly not 10X more like the numbers might lead you to believe.How to Follow IGN Deals RecommendationsThe IGN Deals team has over 30 years of combined experience finding the best discounts and preorders available online.
