It’s a limited-edition 4K Blu-ray release that includes the movie itself, plus tons of extras, which you can find detailed below. It has a steep MSRP of $50, but Amazon just dropped the price, putting it on sale for $31.99 at the moment. It’s set to release October 7, but preordering now locks in the sale price and guarantees you’ll pay the lowest price it drops prior to release.Spawn 4K Limited EditionOut October 7Spawn 4K Limited Edition1$49.95 save 36%$31.99 at AmazonCreated by Todd McFarlane, Spawn was the premier superhero and comic book from the then-nascient Image Comics. He’s an anti-hero of the ‘90s through and through. Spawn is the reincarnation of Al Simmons, a government assassin who died, went to hell, and made a deal with the devil to see his wife once again. Unfortunately for Al, he comes back to life five years later, after his wife has moved on – and he’s also a “hellspawn,” with skin burned beyond recognition, and he’s missing many of his memories.The early issues of the Spawn comic had gorgeous art drawn by McFarlane himself. The comic was popular enough to get an HBO animated series as well as this feature film in 1997. The movie isn’t universally beloved, but plenty of people liked it, including Roger Ebert, who gave it 3.5 stars out of 4. It has an absolutely killer performance from John Leguizamo, who plays Violator. And the movie's soundtrack remains terrific to this day.This new 4K release of the movie really is the full package. It comes with 4K restorations of both the theatrical and director’s cut of the movie. It has a reversible sleeve with two original artwork options. It also comes with an illustrated collector’s booklet featuring new writing on the film by John Torrani and a double-sided poster.
