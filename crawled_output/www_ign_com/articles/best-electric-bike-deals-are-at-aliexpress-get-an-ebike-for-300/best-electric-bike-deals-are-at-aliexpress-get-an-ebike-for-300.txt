Although there are still plenty of "premium" brands that still sell ebikes for well above this threshold, it's no longer an accurate blanket statement. At least today, an entry level ebike can be had for as low as $300. AliExpress has great deals on ebikes in general, but the three deals below stand out in particular for three reasons: (1) they're a lot less expensive than buying the exact same bike off Amazon, (2) they're all shipped from a local US warehouse so you don't need to worry about tariffs or shipping delays, and (3) they're sold by reputable vendors with plenty of reviews and sales to back them up.Amyet V9-G60 1000W Electric Bike for $477.47PRESENTED BY:@AliExpressAmyet V9-G60 1,000W Electric Bike113$899.00 save 47%$477.47 at AliExpressUse code 'USDEAL100'AliExpress via Amyet's official seller account is offering the Amyet V9-G60 Electric Bike for just $477.47 after you apply $100 off coupon code "USDEAL100" during checkout. The same bike is priced at $500 plus $165 shipping on Amazon. I've posted this deal before and it has so far been the best selling ebike here at IGN. Of the three bikes in this roundup, this has the most powerful motor and the biggest battery.The Amyet V9-G60 boasts a 1,000W (1,500W peak) brushless motor that can push the bike at speeds up to 32mph. The 48V 20AH (960Whr) battery can last up to 70 miles on a single charge (the actual distance is dependent on other factors like your speed, terrain, elevation, etc). Other features include a lightweight aluminum frame, Shimano components for its 7-speed transmission, dual suspension, and 20" wheels with 4" fat tires for a more comfortable ride. The bike comes 90% preassembled and includes a 1 year warranty. It's also pretty mod friendly in case you wanted to do your own upgrades (like swapping to hydraulic brakes).Luckeep X1 Lite 750W Electric Bike for $485.24Luckeep X1 Lite 750W (1,400W Peak) Foldable Electric Bike0$1,149.00 save 58%$485.24 at AliExpressUse code 'IFPBXOI'The Luckeep X1 Lite is a better choice if you're looking for an e-bike that you can fold up and store away where space is limited, like in the trunk of your car or SUV. It's also a little bit lighter than the Amyet V9-G60. AliExpress has it on sale for $485.24 after $120 off coupon code "IFPBXOI". The same bike is priced at $650 plus $99 shipping on Amazon.The X1 Lite's 750W (1,500W peak) brushless motor can hit a top speed of about 28mph. The 48V 15AH (720Whr) battery can last up to 50 miles on a single charge. Like the Amyet V9-G60, it also features a lightweight aluminum frame,
Shimano 7-speed transmission, and 20" wheels with 4" fat tires, and is covered by a 12 month warranty. The feature that sets this bike apart from the other two in the roundup is that it can be folded in half with the wheels stacked next to each other. This design makes it much easier to fit in a smaller space. A little engineering magic is needed to make sure that the frame maintains its rigidity and so this feature isn't commonly found in entry level bikes.UrLife E20 Lite 750W Electric Bike for $315.34Urlife E20 Lite 750W (1,000W Peak) Electric Bike0$599.00 save 46%$321.34 at AliExpressUse code 'AEUS64'The UrLife E20 Lite is the least expensive ebike in this roundup, and really just about the cheapest electric bike you can get anywhere.Where else can you get a brand new, pre-assembled ebike at around the $300 price point (after you apply a $64 off coupon code "AEUS64"). The same bike sells for $420 plus $90 shipping on Amazon.UrLife E20 Lite is also the lightest bike in this roundup. Whereas the Luckeep X1 Lite weighs 70 pounds and the Amyet V9-G60 tops the chart at 77 pounds, the E20 Lite comes in at a modest 60 pounds. It's also equipped with a tamer 750W brushless motor with a peak rating of 1,000W, so the top speed is limited to a still respectable 20mph. The 48V 13AH (624Whr) battery, while being the smallest capacity battery in the roundup, has the best range at up to 80 miles, most likely because of the lighter weight and less power hungry motor.This is an excellent entry level electric bike for an adult, or even a responsible teen who's never ridden an ebike before. The ebikes are not toys and you don't want to play with fire by getting something that is beyond your comfort zone. At this price, there's less damage to your wallet (and your dignity) if and when you put some dings and dents into it.Get an extra $50 cash back on this purchase from RetailmenotThis week only, our sister site Retailmenot is offering an extra 30% off cashback on all purchases at AliExpress up to $50 in maximum rewards.
