The only caveat is that imported peripherals don't come with a Nintendo warranty but AliExpress offers a 15-day free returns window in case you get a lemon.Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller for $80.06PRESENTED BY:@AliExpressImport ModelNintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller0$89.99 save 11%$80.06 at AliExpressUse code 'AEUS20'The original Switch Pro controller is, for the most part, still compatible with the new Switch 2. However, the new Pro controller brings a host of improvements to the table, including:Updated HD Rumble 2 (haptic) vibrationA new "C" button for GameChat (new to Switch 2)New rear mappable GL and GR buttonsUp to 50% faster charging speedA headphone jackThe only disadvantage is that the Switch 2 Pro controller is not backwards compatible with the original Switch console. However, if you prefer a gamepad-style controller over the Joy-Con for the Switch 2, then there isn't any other controller you can order that will match the Pro controller's ergonomics and functionality.Switch 2 Pro Controller Review by Michael Higham"Since the Switch 2 Pro Controller is a standalone purchase rather than a pack-in with the console itself – not to mention its $85 price tag – the expectation is that it has to be exceptional. In many respects, it is (although those with bigger hands may struggle with the relatively small grips here). It’s a premium product at a premium price, but if you mostly play your Nintendo Switch 2 docked, getting the new Pro Controller is a layup – you’ll definitely want something better than using the new Joy-Con with the grip attachment that’s included with the console, and the C button and back buttons give folks who already have a go-to Switch controller a reason to upgrade. As third-party options become readily available over time some may end up being more cost-effective, but that doesn’t take away from the Pro Controller being a great, and proven, first-party gamepad."Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.
