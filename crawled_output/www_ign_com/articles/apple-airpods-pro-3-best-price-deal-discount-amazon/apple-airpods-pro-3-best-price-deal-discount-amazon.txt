Apple’s new AirPods Pro 3 have just landed at all major retailers this past weekend, and Amazon is already shaving a little off the price. You can grab them for $239, down from the $249 list price. That’s a small, but sweet, 4% discount, but for Apple gear this fresh, it’s practically a modern miracle.New ReleaseApple AirPods Pro 38$249.00 save 4%$239.00 at AmazonTen bucks might not sound like much, but if you were planning to upgrade anyway, this is a neat little bonus, especially if you’ve been clinging onto your original AirPods Pro longer than you’d like to admit.Every other retailer has them listed for $249 right now, so this is the best price on the new AirPods Pro 3 you can find online. They come with fresh foam-infused eartips, a subtle redesign, improved ANC, and a handful of other upgrades. Apple AirPods Pro 3View 11 ImagesThose foam-infused ear tips are the headliner as well, bringing a new level of noise cancellation to the industry-leading earbuds, and vastly improving fit and comfort. Anything to make sure you’re flinging your AirPods across the room a lot less often.According to Apple, it has even doubled the noise cancellation effectiveness of the previous model, promising“over-the-ear headphone” performance from these bad boys. They've upped the battery life on AirPods Pro 3 as well, boosting the new set to an average of eight to ten hours.Should I Wait for Black Friday?Seeing a discount on something like the new AirPods is a fairly rare occurance, even if it is just $10, but it is does pose a serious question. Will Apple AirPods Pro 3 get a Black Friday discount? It's hard to tell at this stage, but I'm willing to make a prediction.I expect the AirPods Pro 3 will see some sort of discount this Black Friday. That's simply an educated guess, through years of working these shopping events, and covering Apple deals day to day. Now what the actual discount will be, that's anybodies guess (perhaps $20-$30 off, who knows?). For now, a $10 discount at launch is still likely good enough for most Apple users, especially if you want to pay yourself in time and avoid the stress of deal hunting in November.Do You Prefer to Shop on Prime Day or Black Friday?I prefer to shop on Prime DayI prefer to shop on Black FridayI'll shop whenever there are deals!AnswerSee ResultsBut, at the same time, major retailers will almost certainly push the AirPods Pro 2 down to their lowest price yet. That’s good news if you’re a savvy, patient shopper, because the AirPods Pro 2 are still excellent earbuds. For reference, they dropped to $149 during Amazon’s last Prime Day, and Costco is running a similar deal this week as well.With October Prime Day coming up on October 7-8, I wouldn’t be surprised to see a repeat of that deal again at Amazon. Plus, if we’re lucky, the price could dip even further, landing somewhere between $109 and $139 in a couple of weeks, or even on Black Friday itself. Let's wait and see.How to Follow IGN Deals RecommendationsThe IGN Deals team has over 30 years of combined experience finding the best discounts and preorders available online.
