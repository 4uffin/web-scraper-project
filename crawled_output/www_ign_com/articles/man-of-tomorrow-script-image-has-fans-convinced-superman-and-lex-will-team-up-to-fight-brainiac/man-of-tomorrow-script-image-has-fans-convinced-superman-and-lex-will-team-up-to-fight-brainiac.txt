We see posts like these from filmmakers often, and while they don‚Äôt usually reveal too much in terms of plot details, Gunn‚Äôs Man of Tomorrow script features a peculiar image on its front cover: an anatomical illustration of a brain.üòàü§ùüòá #MoT 7.9.27 pic.twitter.com/aIKSFpaHff‚Äî James Gunn (@JamesGunn) September 22, 2025 It‚Äôs a drawing that sent heads spinning for more than a few reasons. Gunn confirmed earlier this month that Man of Tomorrow will see David Corenswet‚Äôs Clark Kent/Superman and Nicholas Hoult‚Äôs Lex Luthor team up to fight a ‚Äúmuch, much bigger threat.‚Äù The former Marvel moviemaker neglected to share exactly what this threat is, of course, but it was enough to have fans hoping to see the all-powerful Brainiac fill the slot.For many, Brainiac is the first name that comes to mind when seeing such a striking image associated with Superman, and it's not just because of his name. DC's Collector of Worlds is a knowledge-obsessed alien who has been known to threaten Metropolis in the past. He's also one of Superman's most infamous foes, though Gunn stops short of saying he will show up for Man of Tomorrow.While Superman villains may not be as well known as Batman‚Äôs rogues gallery, that doesn‚Äôt mean the Man of Steel doesn‚Äôt have his own long list of evildoers who could also fill the main villain role. Doomsday, Darkseid, Bizarro, and General Zod are just a few of the names who have given Superman a run for his money in other, past comic book stories but have yet to appear in the DCU.James Gunn's Man of Tomorrow: Superman vs. Lex Luthor Art GalleryView 4 ImagesThere‚Äôs little to suggest it couldn‚Äôt be one of Superman‚Äôs many, many other enemies showing up to cause trouble in Man of Tomorrow. It would absolutely make sense if that brain on the Superman sequel‚Äôs script is a Brainiac tease, or it could simply be Gunn‚Äôs way of representing Lex Luthor‚Äôs brainpower, considering his more prominent role.‚ÄúIt's as much a Lex movie as it is a Superman movie,‚Äù the director and writer said earlier this month.Today‚Äôs image could be a tease for a number of different things, and it will no doubt give fans plenty to think about while they wait for Man of Tomorrow to arrive July 9, 2027. That hasn‚Äôt stopped some from outright assuming Brainiac is now set to make his live-action DCU debut when the sequel premieres.It‚Äôs definitely Lex & Supes vs Brainiac pic.twitter.com/U77bXxz5vt https://t.co/3Cpsz2YNBg‚Äî Nicholas (@NicholasPas5) September 22, 2025 when Lex and Brainiac are in an intellectual fight like chess I'll be in the theater like this: pic.twitter.com/CimEhLNlM6‚Äî Bob ü¶áüíª (@mrbobwayne) September 22, 2025 BRANIAC INTRODUCTION pic.twitter.com/ZoWddEj4Mh‚Äî Masked_saiyan101 (@DbsContents) September 22, 2025 While we wait for more from Gunn and the rest of the DC team, you can check out everything else we know about Man of Tomorrow.
