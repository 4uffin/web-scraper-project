Hades 2 will release digitally, as I mentioned, in September 2025, and again later as a physical edition on November 20, 2025. Now, let's discuss both and what your options are for preordering each edition.Hades 2 - Physical EditionNintendo Switch 2Hades 2 - Physical Edition4Release Date: November 20, 2025.$49.99 at AmazonHades 2 is now available to preorder in physical format via Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy for $49.99. You won't have to pay anything until release, as each retailer charges on dispatch, not order date.The physical Nintendo Switch 2 edition will include the full game on a card, so it's not a digital game key like many other third-party Switch 2 games.Hades II Switch 2 ScreenshotsView 7 ImagesIt also comes in that bright red Switch 2 case, but surprisingly, the game card will also work on an original Switch, Switch OLED, and Switch Lite. This is because both versions of the game are packed on the cartridge, with no cost for upgrading the game from Switch to Switch 2 either.It's also worth noting for any savvy shoppers out there that the physical Switch 2 edition of the game costs $49.99, and is $20 more than the standard digital copy at $29.99.And finally, it's also worth noting that it's a timed console exclusive, with currently no word on when we can expect the game beyond Switch platforms, and release on PlayStation and Xbox (but if I'd wager a guess, it'll be late 2026 to early 2027). See at Amazon - $49.99See at Best Buy - $49.99See at Walmart - $49.99Hades 2 - Digital EditionLike I mentioned, Hades 2 is set to release on September 25, 2025, digitally for Nintendo Switch, Switch 2, and PC on Steam. If you already bought the game on Steam in its early access form, you won't need to purchase again, as the game will simply need be updated to 1.0. You can buy it in early access now to get your download sorted, and even check out the start of the game, or just wait for the 1.0 patch.For those on Switch looking to play the game ASAP, and don't fancy hanging around until late November, you can also preorder the game digitally via the Nintendo eShop today for $29.99. Plus, if you already have an save file from early access on PC, you'll also be able to transfer it to your Nintendo console if that's where you'd prefer to play going forward.See on Nintendo Shop - $29.99See on Steam (PC) - $29.99Should You Play Hades 2?It's a reasonding yes, at least from me, but the game also sits at an Overwhelmingly Positive review rating on Steam. Like many, I've already checked the game out in early access and spent a lot of my time breaking into the Underworld on Steam Deck. Now, with 1.0 set to release in just a couple of weeks, let me tell you that this is yet again the perfect game to play on the go. It'll suit Switch 2 so well, and as revealed during Nintendo Direct September 2025, Hades 2 runs at 120 frames per second in TV mode on the console. Hot damn! It's well worth picking it up on PC or your friendly Nintendo console for release day, or preordering for the physical coming later this year.If you need any more convincing, consider reading IGN's early access review for the game, of which I'll leave a little snippet of just below as well.What We Said in Our Hades 2 Early Access ReviewMitchell Saltzman said this in his early access review for IGN: "Hades 2 feels impossibly huge and unbelievably polished by any standard, much less an early access game. Mel is awesome, the new tweaks to the combat and progression are excellent,
and its just unbelievably feature packed with twice the content of the first." "Despite that, it is clearly still a work in progress: There are some placeholder art assets; there are still more weapon aspects to come, there’s a weapon missing from the arsenal of a six, there’s currently no proper story ending, and there’s still another planned region that will be part of the next major update in the next few months. But even with all that it’s currently missing, what’s here right out of the gate is astounding, and the thought of more coming on the way is a tantalizing treat."
