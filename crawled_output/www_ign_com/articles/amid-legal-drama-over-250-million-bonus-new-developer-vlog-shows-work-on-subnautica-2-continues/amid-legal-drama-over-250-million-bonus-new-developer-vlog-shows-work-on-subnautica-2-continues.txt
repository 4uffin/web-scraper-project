The video shows off the "aggressive" first encounter players will endure when they meet the enemy in Subnautica 2.Here's the official blurb on the Collector Leviathan from Unknown Worlds:The latest developer vlog provides a behind-the-scenes look at the making of the Collector Leviathan, from early concept art by Visual Development Lead Cory Strader to insights from the Unknown Worlds development team. This creature was designed to push boundaries of immersion and threat in Subnautica 2.Aggressive First Encounter: The Collector Leviathan is the first hostile leviathan players will meet in Subnautica 2.Responsive AI: Powered by Unreal Engine 5 behavior trees and stimulus systems, it reacts to light, sound, and player actions in real time.Lifelike Movement: Fully simulated tentacle animation creates more natural and unpredictable interactions.Immersive Combat Design: A terrifying roar and powerful shockwave attacks amplify the sense of danger.Antonio Muñoz Gallego, AI designer for the creature, said: “The Collector Leviathan is not just a monster that blindly attacks players. It is an intelligent and highly threatening deep-sea lifeform that actively reacts to player behavior and pursues them.” He added: “Our main goal with our creatures was to make them feel reactive, so the Leviathan is constantly re-evaluating the situation in real time. To achieve that, we use Unreal Engine 5 behavior trees and our AI stimulus system.”The vlog will be a welcome update for Subnautica fans. For months now, most coverage about the game has concerned the painful breakdown between Unknown Worlds' founders and Krafton, which acquired Unknown Worlds in October 2021. Over the summer, reports came to light that Subnautica 2's early access release was delayed to 2026 just months before Krafton was due to pay a $250 million bonus to the development team "against the wishes of the studio’s former leadership."Most recently, Krafton issued a response to the lawsuit filed by former leads of Subnautica 2, Charlie Cleveland and Max McGuire, offering rebuttals to the developers' claims and alleging they "resorted to litigation to demand a multimillion-dollar payout they haven't earned."Then, last month, Unknown Worlds itself sued Cleveland, former CEO Ted Gill, and studio co-founder Max McGuire for allegedly stealing game design files shortly before they were fired.It's worth noting that now Hollow Knight: Silksong has come out, Subnautica 2 is the most wishlisted game on Steam, which suggests that despite all the legal drama surrounding the game, there's huge interest in it. That's perhaps little surprise given how big a hit Subnautica was, but it will be interesting to see how fan reception evolves as the sequel gets closer to launch.Subnautica 2’s Early Access release was recently delayed to 2026.Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.
