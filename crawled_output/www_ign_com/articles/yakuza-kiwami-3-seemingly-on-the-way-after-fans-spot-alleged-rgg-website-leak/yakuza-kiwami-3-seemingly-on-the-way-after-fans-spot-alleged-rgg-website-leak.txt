The original listing, which simply mentioned a third entry in the series of Yakuza remakes, has since been removed, though fans were able to capture screenshots of the supposed leak before it was taken down.rgg website accidentally leaked kiwami 3 byu/blubiboy98 inyakuzagamesThe Kiwami series is RGG’s line of remakes of the original Yakuza games. Yakuza Kiwami 1, for example, is a 2016 reimagining of the original Yakuza, with Yakuza Kiwami 2 tackling Yakuza 2. Yakuza Kiwami 3 hasn’t been formally announced, but if RGG does announce it as soon as fans expect, we can safely assume it will be a remake of the 2009 PlayStation 3 title, Yakuza 3.If the Yakuza developer does have something to share about Yakuza Kiwami 3, it won’t be much of a surprise. The studio will host its yearly RGG Summit September 24, with an RGG Direct set to follow immediately after. Many were already expecting major updates for the Like a Dragon franchise, with the alleged website leak arriving just one week before the festivities kick off.Like a Dragon series director Masayoshi Yokoyama also commented on Yakuza Kiwami 3 in April 2024. While he cautioned fans from getting too excited for a third game while it worked on other projects, he did tease that it was definitely not off the table.“I'll just say that I think I'll do Kiwami 3 at some point,” Yokoyama said at the time. “I'm sure I'll do it someday.”Now, more than one year later, fans believe RGG may finally be ready to talk more about Yakuza Kiwami 3.
