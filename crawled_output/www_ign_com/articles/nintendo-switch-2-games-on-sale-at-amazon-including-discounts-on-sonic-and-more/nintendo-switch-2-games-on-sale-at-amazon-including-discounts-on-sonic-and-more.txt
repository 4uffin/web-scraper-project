Here are the best deals we've spotted, starting from as low as $30, and well worth considering even in the build-up to the October Prime Day and Black Friday sales to come.Switch 2 Games Are As Low as $30 at Amazon TodayNintendo Switch 2 Split Fiction7$49.99 save 6%$46.99 at AmazonNintendo Switch 2 Sonic x Shadow Generations4$49.99 save 20%$39.88 at AmazonNintendo Switch 2 Bravely Default Flying Fairy HD Remastered4$74.94 save 33%$49.95 at AmazonNintendo Switch 2 Civilization VII1$69.99 save 14%$59.99 at AmazonNintendo Switch 2 Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S2$39.99 save 25%$29.83 at AmazonNintendo Switch 2 Yakuza 0: Director’s Cut3$49.99 save 20%$39.88 at AmazonNintendo Switch 2 Raidou Remastered4$49.99 save 30%$34.99 at AmazonNintendo Switch 2 Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma2$69.00 save 14%$59.50 at AmazonNintendo Switch 2 Hogwarts Legacy2$59.99 save 18%$49.30 at AmazonNintendo Switch 2 Madden NFL 262$69.99 save 29%$49.99 at AmazonThe cheapest game here is Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S, which has a 25% discount that brings it down to $29.83. That’s a great deal for a multiplayer puzzler that’s easy to play for all ages.In fact, SEGA is very well represented here. There’s 20% off of Yakuza 0: Director’s Cut, as well as 20% off of Sonic x Shadow Generations. You can save 30% on Raidou: Remastered – The Mystery of the Soulless Army Launch Edition (that’s one hell of a title), bringing the action RPG down to just $34.99 from $49.99, while Rune Factory Guardians of Azuma offers combat and farming in equal measure for $59.50 - a discount of 14% from its MSRP of $69.Next up, the Switch 2 Edition of Civilization VII is $59.99, reduced from $69.99. Not a huge discount, admittedly, but the Switch 2 Edition adds some excellent mouse control functionality.Square Enix’s throwback RPG Bravely Default Flying Fairy HD Remastered gets a 33% discount, but since it started at almost $75, it's a little harder to get excited. Hogwarts Legacy is down to $49.30, too.For EA titles, the excellent co-op adventure Split Fiction is down to $46.99 (expect it to be a firm favorite for Game of the Year discussions), while Madden NFL 26 only launched a few weeks ago and gets a 29% discount. It’s now $49.99, down from $69.99.Lloyd Coombes is an experienced freelancer in tech, gaming and fitness seen at Polygon, Eurogamer, Macworld, TechRadar and many more.
