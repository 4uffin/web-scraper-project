It's due out fall 2026.The action-packed trailer, below, reveals characters Omega Red and Mystique, as well as a face-off against a mutant-hunting Sentinel. Locations include the Canadian wilderness, Tokyo, and Madrapoor. Liam Mcintyre, JD Fenix from Gears, plays Logan/Wolverine in the game.Insomniac said it will show more of Wolverine in the spring of 2026.In a post on the PlayStation Blog, Aaron Jason Espinoza, Senior Community Manager, Insomniac Games, teased the story and revealed the Wolverine cover art, which you can view in the slideshow of images, below."Independence is often the way of Wolverine, although keen-eyed fans may have spotted some of the familiar faces he’ll encounter on his journey, like the elusive Mystique or the brutish Omega Red. Some will fight alongside Logan against all odds and others will unleash all-out attacks on our hero, such as the Reavers, one of our enemy factions, who will keep our hero’s instincts on edge. Speaking of which, our trailer concludes with a prototype of an iconic-yet-menacing purple robot. "In this global thriller, Wolverine’s search for answers will send him on perilous excursions to exotic locales, including the island nation of Madripoor, the frosted wilderness of Canada, and the narrow city streets of Tokyo – all potential battlegrounds for fierce, bloody, destructive action."Marvel's Wolverine Screenshots and Cover ArtView 5 ImagesWe’d heard nothing official on Wolverine since its reveal in 2021, save a shift in leadership reported in October 2024. Previous creative director Brian Horton jumped ship to Xbox as the new creative director for Perfect Dark, which was being co-developed by The Initiative and Crystal Dynamics before Microsoft canceled the game.Unofficially, early Wolverine footage and information emerged from data stolen from Insomniac in December 2023.Be sure to check out everything announced during State of Play September 2025 to find out what else is coming to PlayStation 5.Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
