Fans will be happy to know that The Darkness is making its return to the stands just ahead of the franchise's 30th anniversary, and original creator Marc Silvestri is back on board.IGN can exclusively reveal that Image Comics and Top Cow are rebooting The Darkness with a new ongoing series that kicks off in December 2025. The new book will be written by Silvestri. Ed Benes (Justice League of America) will draw the first issue, with inks from Matt “Batt!” Banning, Sal Regla, and John Livesay, colors by Arif Prianto, and letters by Troy Peteri. Raymond Gay (Gunslinger Spawn) will take over art duties beginning with issue #2. The first issue features covers by Silvestri, Benes, and David Mack.Check out the slideshow gallery below to see cover art and early interior pencils for The Darkness #1:The Darkness #1 Exclusive Preview GalleryView 19 ImagesThe new series isn't a continuation of the existing The Darkness mythos, but will deliver a new take on the adventures of mafia hitman-turned-supernatural avenger Jackie Estacado, beginning with his origin story. Here's Image's official summary of the new series:In a world consumed by shadows...one man becomes The Darkness. Jackie Estacado is back! Thrust into a supernatural war between the dark and the light in a no-holds-barred adventure where the edge of our reality grinds against supernatural forces grappling for control over each other and the waking world.Mafia Hitman Jackie Estacado was both blessed and cursed on his 21st birthday when he became the bearer of The Darkness, an elemental force that allows those who wield it access to an otherworldly dimension and control over the demons who dwell there. Forces in the world rise up to face Jackie and the evil his gift represents. There is one small problem in this story…evil is good.“The Darkness has always been one of my favorite characters, and I’ve wanted to come back to it for a long time,” said Silvestri in a statement. “Fans have been asking for years when Jackie would return, and now we get to deliver something truly special. This is going to feel familiar, but it’s going to take you places you’ve never been before.”“This isn’t just a nostalgia trip—it’s a reinvention,” added Silvestri. “We’re going back to what made The Darkness such a hit: Its grit, its danger, its sense that power always comes with a price. But this time, we’re turning everything up to eleven. Jackie’s world is going to expand in ways readers never expected.”The Darkness #1 will be released on December 10, with a final order cutoff of November 10. You can preorder a copy at your local comic shop.In other comics news, Dark Horse is releasing The Art of Star Wars: A New Hope - The Manga, and Absolute Batman #12 provides twisted new origin stories for several iconic DC villains.Jesse is a mild-mannered staff writer for IGN.
