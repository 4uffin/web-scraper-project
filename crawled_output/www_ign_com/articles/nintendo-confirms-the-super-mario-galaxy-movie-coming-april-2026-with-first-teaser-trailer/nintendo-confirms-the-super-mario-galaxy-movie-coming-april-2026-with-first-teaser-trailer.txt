Movie titled The Super Mario Galaxy Movie.It’s confirmation that arrives after rumors swept the internet yesterday, revealing that Nintendo will indeed be partnering up with the Minions movie studio yet again to create a movie adaptation of the classic 2007 Wii platformer. It’s slated to arrive in the U.S. April 3, 2026, and in Japan April 24, 2026, with its first trailer revealing a small amount of footage before showing off its official title and logo.Today's announcement also revealed some of The Super Mario Galaxy Movie's cast. It's a lineup that focuses on returning names that shouldn't come as too much of a surprise, with Chris Pratt back as Mario, Anya Taylor-Joy back as Princess Peach, Charlie Day back as Luigi, Jack Black back as Bowser, Keegan-Michael Key back as Toad, and Kevin Michael Richardson back as Kamek.Of course, The Super Mario Galaxy Movie has a lot of potential for newcomers to the cast, too. Who will play Rosalina is likely the question on the minds of most fans, as the storytelling icon first made her debut in the original 2007 game but didn't show up for The Super Mario Bros. Movie. The last film also teased a potential appearance from Yoshi, though it's unclear if Mario's dinosaur companion will have any speaking lines when or if he eventually appears.The Super Mario Galaxy Movie Teaser Trailer - ScreenshotsView 6 ImagesThe Super Mario Galaxy Movie is out in just about seven months.
