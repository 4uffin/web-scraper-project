In several cases, Amazon’s pricing has dipped under TCGPlayer’s, which is usually the lowest benchmark for sealed product. For example, the Unova Poster Collection is $39.98 on Amazon versus $28.77 on TCGPlayer, and the Prismatic Evolutions Mini Tin is $33.28 at Amazon compared to $24.87 on TCGPlayer. Those kinds of gaps show which items are trending under market value right now, and they’re the deals most collectors will want to move on quickly.Amyet V9-G60 Electric Bike for $477.47PRESENTED BY:@AliExpressAmyet V9-G60 1,000W Electric Bike102$899.00 save 47%$477.47 at AliExpressUse code 'USDEAL100'Get an extra $50 cash back on this purchase from RetailmenotThis week only, our sister site Retailmenot is offering an extra 30% off cashback on all purchases at AliExpress up to $50 in maximum rewards.

The vast majority of booster packs, tins, and trainer boxes are sitting cheaper there than on Amazon, often by $5-$15. Bundles like the White Flare Binder Collection and the Shining Fates Collection Pikachu V Box are up to $40 off, deals that everyone should be snapping up right now. It’s worth keeping an eye on these dips, since Amazon tends to fluctuate prices more often than dedicated TCG retailers.Pokémon TCG Below Market ValueBlack Bolt Booster Bundle0$58.95 save 15%$50.01 at Amazon$50.99 at TCGPlayerWhite Flare Booster Bundle0$58.95 save 22%$45.90 at Amazon$48.99 at TCGPlayerTeam Rocket Tin1$41.24 at Amazon$43.84 at TCGPlayerParadox Pokémon Stacking Tin0$26.32 at Amazon$26.95 at TCGPlayerTrick or Trade BOOster Bundle (2024)0$21.22 at Amazon$27.47 at TCGPlayerUnova Mini Tin0$19.99 at Amazon$21.98 at TCGPlayerWhile TCGPlayer is often the go-to marketplace for low Pokémon TCG prices, a handful of sealed products are currently cheaper on Amazon, making them below market value and worth grabbing.

Collectors looking for nostalgic sets can also snag the Team Rocket Tin at $41.24, or the Paradox Pokémon Stacking Tin at $26.32.

The clear winner is Lugia V (Alternate Full Art) 186/195, which has surged 68% since July to $427, cementing itself as the set’s chase card. Trainer Gallery standouts like Rayquaza VMAX TG20/TG30 and Blaziken VMAX TG15/TG30 have also doubled or tripled in value thanks to strong artwork and nostalgia, while even Lugia VSTAR continues climbing on competitive strength. At the same time, cards like Regidrago V (Alternate Art) and Alolan Vulpix VSTAR have cooled as the meta shifted away from them, with values slipping back toward the $12–$14 range.

Collectors aren’t waiting for modern reprints, they’re chasing the originals, and prices are showing it. Some cards have exploded in value, while others have steadied after sharp climbs, creating both momentum plays and entry points for buyers. Leading the surge is M Rayquaza EX (Shiny Full Art - Ancient Origins), which has skyrocketed over 426% this year, from $275 in January to $1,450 today. M Gengar EX (Secret Rare - Phantom Forces) isn’t far behind, up nearly fivefold to $415, cementing its place as one of the most sought-after Megas. Other heavy-hitters include M Rayquaza EX (Full Art - Roaring Skies), now at $656, M Charizard EX (X - Flashfire) climbing past $349, and Primal Groudon EX (Shiny Full Art), which has more than doubled to $349. These climbers show how nostalgia, unique mechanics, and iconic artwork are driving a collector frenzy.But not every Mega Evolution is running away in price. Some cards have plateaued after strong early-year gains, leaving a rare buying window before the next spike. M Mewtwo EX (Full Art - BREAKthrough) climbed from $37 to $145 but has leveled off in recent weeks, while M Alakazam EX (Full Art - Fates Collide) sits steady just under $100 after jumping from $28 earlier this year. Even Charizard is showing signs of cooling, M Charizard EX (Generations) and M Charizard EX (Full Art - Evolutions) have tripled since January but are holding in the $190-$200 range for now. These pauses don’t signal weakness; rather, they reflect consolidation before the broader Mega Evolution wave hits with new set releases. For collectors and investors, the message is clear: the grails are climbing fast, but the plateaued cards may be the smarter pickups before Mega hype takes over the market again.Crown Zenith Prices Are Rising12% Crash from Feb 25Leafeon VSTAR - GG35/GG700$49.87 save 12%$43.69 at TCGPlayer26% Crash from Feb 25Glaceon VSTAR - GG40/GG700$47.82 save 26%$35.20 at TCGPlayer19% Crash from Feb 25Deoxys VMAX - GG45/GG700$44.73 save 19%$36.22 at TCGPlayer26% Crash from May 25Suicune V - GG38/GG700$45.29 save 26%$33.66 at TCGPlayer19% Crash from March 25Raikou V - GG41/GG700$32.61 save 19%$26.30 at TCGPlayer16% Climb from July 25Giratina VSTAR (Secret) - GG69/GG700$152.08 save -19%$180.65 at TCGPlayer31% Climb from June 25Mewtwo VSTAR - GG44/GG701$101.92 save -46%$148.74 at TCGPlayer19% Climb from July 25Arceus VSTAR (Secret) - GG70/GG700$89.15 save -24%$110.24 at TCGPlayer31% Climb from July 25Origin Forme Dialga VSTAR (Secret) - GG68/GG702$65.72 save -45%$95.30 at TCGPlayer17% Climb from July 25Origin Forme Palkia VSTAR (Secret) - GG67/GG700$60.51 save -20%$72.65 at TCGPlayerThe Crown Zenith market has been showing two very different stories this month. On one hand, several Galarian Gallery Ultra Rares are slipping as hype fades, with fan-favorites like Leafeon VSTAR and Suicune V dropping more than 20% from their peaks. On the other hand, the gold Secret Rares are climbing steadily, led by Giratina VSTAR and Arceus VSTAR, as collectors chase the scarce, high-end pieces of the set. This split reflects a maturing market: casual collectors are less interested in mid-tier Eeveelutions and V cards, while serious players and investors are doubling down on the big four golds.Among the crashers, Leafeon VSTAR has fallen from nearly $50 to the $43 range, and Glaceon VSTAR is down 26% since February, hovering in the mid-$30s. Deoxys VMAX has slipped under $37, while Suicune V and Raikou V both lost more than a quarter of their value since spring. These are still striking artworks, but set fatigue and limited competitive relevance are pushing prices down. Meanwhile, the climbers are commanding all the attention. Giratina VSTAR (Secret) has surged nearly 20% since July to $180, making it the definitive chase of Crown Zenith. Mewtwo VSTAR is also up more than 30% this summer, with its Charizard battle artwork driving collector demand. Rounding out the gains, Arceus VSTAR, Origin Forme Dialga VSTAR, and Origin Forme Palkia VSTAR are all trending higher as well, thanks to their powerful abilities and limited supply. Taken together, the set still holds broad collector appeal, but it’s clear the market is consolidating around the golden Secret Rares as the safest long-term holds.First Party Nintendo Switch 2 PreordersPreorder: Releases October 16, 2025.Pokémon Legends: Z-A – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition0$69.99 at AmazonPreorder: Releases October 16, 2025.Nintendo Switch 2 + Pokémon Legends: Z-A - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Bundle0$499.99 at AmazonPreorder: Releases November 20, 2025.Kirby Air Riders0$69.99 at AmazonPreorder: Releases November 20, 2025.Kirby & Warp Star - Kirby Air Riders Series Amiibo0$49.99 at AmazonPreorder: Releases November 20, 2025.Bandana Waddle Dee & Winged Star - Kirby Air Riders Series
