The sheer amount of options can make it difficult to find exactly what you're looking for, especially for anime with some major titles split up between multiple services.If you're wondering where you can watch anime online in 2025, we've gathered some of the best sites and apps below. While some streaming services offer a full suite of options, others have only a smaller selection. Fortunately, there are plenty of ways to watch the best anime online across various subscriptions, and some are super cheap or even free.CrunchyrollBest Anime Streaming Service OverallBrowse Crunchyroll PlansIf you're looking for the absolute best overall anime streaming service, Crunchyroll is the way to go. With an enormous catalog of anime movies and series, the anime-focused streaming service is your best bet if you're looking for a lot of options. They also offer new episodes of many popular anime series shortly after they air in Japan. Whether you're looking to watch the classics or watch new episodes of anime like the upcoming final season of My Hero Academia, Crunchyroll can provide that with a subscription.Crunchyroll has three different tiers of their service that all offer streaming their full anime library without ads. They also offer a seven-day free trial for newcomers to test out the service, but the cheapest plan starts out at $7.99 a month after that. Crunchyroll does offer some anime for free with ads, regardless of your subscription tier, including Chainsaw Man and My Hero Academia. The most expensive tier of the service will get you additional perks like discounts at the Crunchyroll Store and access to their game vault.Anime Recommendations on Crunchyroll: Dragon Ball: DAIMA 4See it at CrunchyrollJujutsu Kaisen 2See it at CrunchyrollSolo Leveling3See it at CrunchyrollMy Hero Academia3See it at CrunchyrollTubiBest Free Anime Streaming ServiceRegister for TubiIf you're looking for the best place to watch anime for free, Tubi is a surprisingly great option. Supported by ads, Tubi offers a selection of anime that includes Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh, Naruto, and various other popular franchises. They also have an enormous selection of classics and new anime to choose from in their catalog, all of which does not cost a dime. You can check out the full list of anime on Tubi to see what they have available.Tubi doesn't require a monthly subscription to start streaming content, but you do need to register. You can create an account using your email or simply use your Google account to sign in. Tubi also offers free films and TV shows from a variety of other genres, making it one of the best free movie sites available.Anime Recommendations on Tubi: Death Note3See it at TubiJoJo's Bizarre Adventure2See it at TubiInuyasha4See it at Tubi Yu-Gi-Oh! 2See it at TubiHIDIVE Best Cheap Anime Streaming ServiceSign Up for HIDIVE's 7-Day Free TrialIf you're looking for something more robust than a free streaming service, but without coughing up your life savings for something Crunchyroll, you might enjoy a compromise like HIDIVE. The service has a single subscription tier that costs $6.99/month or $69.99/year, which gives you access to full series like Nana, No Game No Life, and Food Wars!. The site is also the exclusive streaming home for series like Made in Abyss, and regularly hosts simulcasts (you can check the current schedule here). In my opinion, this is also a solid place to find hidden gems you might not come across on something more mainstream.

A Hulu subscription can get you access to a huge variety of movies, shows, and anime all at once. While the service doesn't have quite the depth you'd get with Crunchyroll, they do offer popular anime series (both subbed and dubbed) like Dragon Ball, Attack on Titan, and Naruto. They also have the latest episodes of Spy x Family and Chainsaw Man if you're looking for something fresh. You can check out the full catalog of anime on Hulu for more details about what the service can offer. Hulu has 2 different plans to choose from: No ads for $18.99 a month or with ads for $9.99 a month (raising to $11.99/month on October 21). Aside from standalone plans, Hulu is also available in plenty of streaming bundles, which I'd definitely recommend in light of news that Hulu will be merging into Disney+ next year.

They have One Piece, Hunter x Hunter, Demon Slayer, and even a few Pokemon movies. However, the real draw of Netflix for anime fans is that they have originals that are actually pretty good. There are some great original films like Bubble as well as video game adaptations like Tekken: Bloodline. You can check out our guide to the best anime on Netflix for our top picks.Although Netflix is currently going through some changes in it's subscription system, the ad-supported plan is currently $7.99 a month. The standard and premium subscriptions are more expensive, but add the ability to download Netflix movies for offline viewing.Anime Recommendations on Netflix: The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.3See it at NetflixDevilman Crybaby1See it at NetflixCyberpunk Edgerunners2See it at NetflixViolet Evergarden1See it at NetflixHBO MaxBest Streaming Service for Anime MoviesBrowse Max Subscription Plans and DealsNow that HBO Max is back to the original name, it's a lot harder to find what their selection of anime even is. That being said, HBO Max does have all of the Studio Ghibli movies available to stream, making them worthy of note on this list. More recently, HBO Max signed a new deal with GKIDS, giving the streaming service rights to some previously hard-to-find movies from directors like Makoto Shinkai and Hideaki Anno. HBO Max is also where you'll find anime picked up for American distribution by Adult Swim, like the new anime from the creator of Cowboy Bebop, Lazarus. HBO Max has three different tiers of their subscription service starting at $9.99 for their ad-supported option.Anime Recommendations on Max: The Boy and the Heron 0See it at MaxLazarus0See it at MaxSpirited Away3See it at MaxSuicide Squad Isekai 1See it at MaxUzumaki3See it at MaxAnime Streaming Sites FAQWhat are the best sites to watch anime for free? Aside from Tubi and the limited selection of free anime on Crunchyroll, there's a few more sites where you can stream anime for free. RetroCrush offers a wide selection of "vintage" anime and cartoons, including the original Astro Boy, Yu-Gi-Oh!, and City Hunter series. Sling TV's FreeStream program also includes several anime channels with on demand series like Fruits Basket, Maid-Sama, and Ghost Stories. How much are you willing to pay for a streaming service per month?$5$10$15$20$30$50+AnswerSee ResultsHow can I watch anime live in the U.S.?Most anime airs live in Japan before becoming available to stream in the United States. Crunchyroll's licensing deals allow the service to stream new episodes typically within a day of their original airtime, which is part of the reason why its the best streaming service for anime overall. With a couple of exceptions for exclusives, even anime that eventually comes to Netflix or Hulu typically arrives on Crunchyroll way beforehand. If there's a new episode or special coming up that you really want to watch live, you'll most likely have to sign up for a VPN to get access to local Japanese channels like FujiTV.
