With pretty much every retailer planning some sort of way to attract customers throughout 2025, there are plenty of sales to look forward to this year. With many tariffs in effect in the U.S. and more presumably arriving later this year, shoppers are looking for discounts wherever they can find them.If you're hoping to save some money at any point this year, there are a few different sale dates worth marking on your calendar, the next one being Amazon's October Prime Day. We've gathered some of the biggest upcoming sales events we know about to help you plan out your online (or in-store) shopping in 2025 and beyond. You can also check out all of the sales already live to see the best discounts right now.Where do you prefer to shop online?AmazonWalmartBest BuyTargetCostco / Sam's ClubOtherAnswerSee ResultsActive Sales Live NowApple Back to School Sale (Now-September 30)Apple Back to School Sale Starts Now3Get up to $179 in Apple accessories (including a pair of AirPods) when you purchase an eligible iPad, MacBook, or iMac with an Education Store discountSee it at Apple StoreThe Apple Back to School Sale started on June 17 and runs through September 30. This year Apple is offering an accessory worth up to $179 - or up to $179 off more expensive accessories - when you purchase an eligible iPad, MacBook, or iMac that qualifies for an Education discount.Upcoming Sales Events1. Prime Big Deal Days (October 7-8)Although it's a fairly new thing, Amazon has started offering a Prime Day-like sale in October ahead of Black Friday deals. The online retailer doesn't call it a Prime Day sale (this sale is "Prime Big Deal Days"), but that's essentially what it is. This first started in 2022 when Amazon announced a big fall sale to get ahead of the Black Friday shopping season and has since been adopted by other major retailers.Amazon has finally announced the dates for the sale and it will be taking place on October 7-8 as a traditional two-day event. This is how Amazon's Prime Day originally was before it got extended to a four days for the first time this year. While we don't yet know what deals to expect, there are already some early deals worth shopping.2. Black Friday Sales (November 1–30)Black Friday is the best time to buy pretty much everything, regardless of the category or retailer. It's the single biggest shopping event and if there are discounts to be had, it's almost definitely going to be sometime during this sale. Although Black Friday 2025 itself lands on November 28, the actual sale has a much larger window than that.You can expect the first Black Friday deals to start arriving shortly after October Prime Day sales are concluded, but the general rule of thumb is that all of November will have Black Friday pricing happening everywhere. Many of the best deals will still take place on Thanksgiving and the Friday afterwards.In terms of when major retailers will start dropping their official Black Friday sales in 2025, we will have to wait for confirmation sometime in late October. But usually, you can expect those to begin the weekend before actual Black Friday – that would mean around November 21 this year.3. Cyber Monday Sales (November 30–December 5)Cyber Monday began back in 2005 as a way to offer shoppers online discounts after Thanksgiving weekend so they could avoid the in-store madness. With the majority of holiday sales moving to an online platform, it has since become just as big as Black Friday. Although there are sometimes differences between Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales, they are generally the same thing. The only difference is when they actually happen.You can expect Cyber Monday sales to kick off Sunday of Black Friday weekend, rather than actual Cyber Monday. And although the best deals will likely be on November 30 through December 1, many retailers extend their sale through the week by labeling the deals as part of Cyber Week.Which Shopping Holiday Do You Shop On?Black FridayCyber MondayAnswerSee Results4. Green Monday Sales (December 8–23)Green Monday is actually a sales event created by eBay back in 2007. While it isn't nearly as big as Black Friday or Cyber Monday, it essentially represents the last stretch of sales before Christmas. The day itself was originally created as a way to promote the last day you could buy something online and get it shipped to you before the holidays, but thanks to faster shipping every year, that isn't necessarily as much of a problem for the bigger retailers.In 2024, you can expect Green Monday sales to stretch pretty much right up until December 24 and maybe even through Christmas. Many retailers will label these as "last-minute" sales, but we've lumped them all into the same category.5. New Year's Sales (December 26–January 1)The final sales event of 2025 is centered around New Year's, but it usually starts just after Christmas. These discounts are a chance for retailers to take advantage of shoppers who are returning unwanted gifts and are now flush with extra cash. You can also expect some surprisingly good deals on older tech as these same retailers look to unload older models to make way for newer ones. Late December and early January are actually some of the best times to buy a TV or find a deal on a gaming monitor every year thanks to the proximity to CES, the annual Consumer Electronics Show.Jacob has written for various different publications over his career covering commerce, tech, games, and entertainment.
