The patch notes, per Team Cherry’s website, are below.All fixes will apply retroactively, Team Cherry added, so players who've hit a significant bug that prevents progress should now be able to proceed.Further fixes are currently being worked on for a third patch, the developer continued, with some additional focus around improving controller support on PC platforms. “Expect this one to come a little later, as we’re aiming to cover as many remaining issues as possible,” Team Cherry said.Meanwhile, Team Cherry said for upcoming patches, beyond regular fixes, “our first priority remains to improve Silksong’s Simplified Chinese translation.”This is in response to high-profile criticism of Silksong’s Simplified Chinese translation, which had led to Chinese players leaving negative Steam reviews. "The current Silksong [Chinese] translation reads like a Wuxia novel instead of conveying the game’s tone," said one player. "This isn’t about effort, but about taste and direction, and speaking from experience likely can’t be fixed without replacing the translator." Another said: "can you imagine as a Chinese, I need to play the game by switching in English to understand [the] translation.""Native Chinese speaker here. The translation uses awkwardly archaic wording that makes a lot of the content unintelligible," added someone else. "I’m talking about word salad type of situation. On top of the anachronistic pretentiousness, it’s downright gibberish at times."“A new script, by a well-regarded team, is already well underway,” Team Cherry confirmed. “We’re expecting this new translation to be delivered in 3-4 weeks, with implementation to follow immediately after.“In the meantime, for Simplified Chinese players, we’ve recently been informed that a talented group of Hollow Knight fans has already produced their own full-translation mod for Silksong! We’ve heard good things about the mod, and players may want to consider shifting over to it.”Hollow Knight: Silksong Release Trailer ScreenshotsView 24 ImagesPlaying Silksong?
