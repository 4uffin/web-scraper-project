You don't often find a day-one deal on Apple products, so grab them if you want them.Apple has announced AirPods Pro 3, a new model of the company’s popular active noise-cancelling earbuds.

This new model has foam-infused ear tips to help keep out unwanted noise. Plus, Apple says, it has double the noise cancellation effectiveness of the previous model — and four times that of the original AirPods Pro. Apple promises “over-the-ear headphone performance” out of these things.If you’ve found previous AirPods Pro uncomfortable to wear, or they tended to fall out of your ears while doing things like exercising, you should find AirPods Pro 3 to be a better fit. They’ve been designed to fit more snugly in more ear types. And they come with five sizes of ear tips, instead of the three in previous releases.Apple AirPods Pro 3View 11 ImagesAdditionally, Apple has upped the battery life on AirPods Pro 3 from six hours in the previous model to eight hours in the new model – and that’s while using active noise cancellation. If you’re listening in transparency mode, you can get up to 10 hours of batter life on a single charge. If you have an iPhone to pair AirPods Pro 3 with, you’ll be able to use a live translation feature during conversation with someone who speaks a different language. When enabled, it lowers the volume on the words coming into your ears, while Siri translates those words for you in real time. The translation is based on phrases, rather than individual words, to make the meaning more accurate. And when you respond in your own language, your words are displayed on your iPhone in the receiver’s language. Your phone can read the translated message aloud as well.For those who enjoy listening to music or podcasts while they work out, AirPods Pro 3 feature IP57 sweat and water resistance, so they shouldn’t become damaged in any way from normal encounters with water. AirPods Pro 3 also have heartbeat sensors, which can track your exercises in the Fitness app.Every year, AirPods Pro are among the top-selling items for IGN’s commerce team.
