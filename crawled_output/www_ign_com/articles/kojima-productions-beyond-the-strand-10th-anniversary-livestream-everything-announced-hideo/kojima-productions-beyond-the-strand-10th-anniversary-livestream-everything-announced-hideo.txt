After you check it out, let us know what your favorite moment was! Hideo Kojima Reveals First Trailer for Xbox Game Studios Title ODDuring the Beyond the Strand livestream, Hideo Kojima and Xbox head Phil Spencer helped share the first trailer for OD, Kojima Productions' Xbox Game Studios horror project.The footage begins with an ominous red door and a red card being used to try to unlock it. We then get some redacted text that reads: Ten years since the [REDACTED] Horror [REDACTED], "[REDACTED]." The Cursed [REDACTED] Have Once Again [REDACTED] Into the Forbidden.We then see the back of the card, which says, "Light the Fires to Celebrate Their [REDACTED] [REDACTED].More Text: This Building Was [REDACTED] From a 3D Scan of an [REDACTED] Found in an [REDACTED]. And then, [REDACTED] Were [REDACTED] In a Sinister Ritual.More gameplay was shown of someone entering a room on a stormy day. There is a shrine of sorts, and the character pulls out a match from a box that says "missing." They then proceed to light candles, including one that looks like a baby. When they light that last one, a baby starts crying. They then light another candle shaped like another young person's head and it starts bleeding. We then see our character, who is played by Honor Among Thieves' Sophia Lillis, and she looks absolutley terrified as something approaches her from behind and then grabs her.It then cuts to credits and we see OD will star Lillis, Hunters' Udo Kier, and Euphoria's Hunter Schafer. Oh, and that it is for "all players and screamers."Furthermore, it looks like OD will have a subtitle of Knock and an exploration of the "fear of the knock." Kojima also noted that Jordan Peele will be focusing on another fear for his OD project, but that fear of the knock will be one of Kojima's focuses. He also said he wants to go all around the world to scary places and even "scan a ghost for the first time and get an awards for that." Hideo Kojima Reveals New Details on PlayStation's PhysintWhile Kojima said he was still in the conceptual phase and working on characters and stories, he was still able to help share a few new details on his upcoming action espionage project for PlayStation called Phyisnt. We started by seeing a poster of Physint with a male character shrouded in darkness and holding a gun. Along with the character who hasn't been revealed yet, we have the words, "Here comes the feeling." It was also shared that Charlee Fraser (Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga), Don Lee aka Ma Dong-seok (Eternals), and Minami Hamabe (Godzilla Minus One) will be joining the cast of Physint. To end the segment, he shared a look at Hamabe's character in the game's engine.Death Stranding: Mosquito Is the Working Title for a New Animation Project, Trailer RevealedKojima announced Death Stranding: Mosquito, which is the working title for a new animation project from director Hiroshi Miyamoto (ABC Animation Studio) and writer Aaron Guzikowski. The team wants to differentiate the look of the animation film project and the games, and we got to see this in action in a teaser trailer you can see above. It was also revealed the main character, who is not Sam Porter Bridges, will have the ability to "suck something really important" that isn't blood, and that's why they went with the working title of Death Stranding: Mosquito.It was also revealed that Death Stranding: Mosquito is being animated in a very unique style that begins with hand-drawn lines that are then digitally used to create the animation itself. The backgrounds of the film are also being done by Studio Easter, who has previously worked on Dandadan.Hideo Kojima Announces AR Project With Pokémon Go Creator NianticKojima Productions is partnering with Niantic Spatial on a new AR game that aims to "move beyond the screen" and "redefine immersive entertainment." Niantic Spatial is the new name for Pokemon Go creator Niantic, and this new project that is still very much in the works was described in a bit more detail by Kojima and Niantic Spatial boss John Hanke."I can't really speak about details yet but, if you're climbing a mountain... there's still entertainment there," Kojima teased. "It's like the real Death Stranding in the real world, and you can connect with people, or you can connect with the actual environment there in your city. Previously it was like virtual reality, but this time I'm thinking about connecting with the real environment.""I hope that it creates [an environment] that brings people together to play," Hanke said. "If there's one thing need we have in our society right now, it's something that unifies us and doesn't pull us apart. And I think that storytelling... has always been humanity's way of coming together. And technology can support that. It can divide it too, but with an inspiring creator it can be an important force in the world."Kojima and A24 Give a Brief Update on the Death Stranding MovieKojima and A24 took the stage to give a few updates on the upcoming Death Stranding film. The movie's director, Michael Sarnoski, also was on hand to share a bit about how they are envisioning this adaptation."With this project we really want to capture the soul of the game, capture the themes of the game, but we also want to tell a story that you haven't seen in that world and explore characters you haven't seen before," Sarnoski said. "Also, we want to find all of that scope and all of those incredible real locations, but also find all of those nuanced characters and just do justice to this on a micro and macro scale."The team wants the film to tell a new story in Death Stranding's world that will be familiar to those who have played the game but also not confusing to those who never have. Kojima Productions Partnering With Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group On a Credit CardHideo Kojima and Kojima Productions are collaborating with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group on a brand-new credit card that is aiming to be released in the second half of 2026. This card will also have a smartphone app and digital card to make payments, and it will let users accumulate points and exchange them for merch and goods. The team is working on what themed goods and merch can be used alongside game characters and themes for the card itself.
