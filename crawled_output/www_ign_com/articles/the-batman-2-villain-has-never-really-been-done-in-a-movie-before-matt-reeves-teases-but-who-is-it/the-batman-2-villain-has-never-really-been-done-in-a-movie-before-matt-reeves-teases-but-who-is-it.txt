If it makes that date, the sequel will arrive five-and-a-half years after The Batman. We know Robert Pattinson will reprise his role as the moody Caped Crusader, and Colin Farrell will once again play crime boss Penguin, although it sounds like it's a minor role.But who will play the main villain this time around, and which character from Batman’s rogues' gallery has Reeves plucked from the comics to bring to live action?In an interview with Josh Horowitz, Reeves kept his cards close to his chest, but did explain his thinking on the new villain, and issued a tease that has sparked all sorts of speculation among the fandom.“I had a lot of ideas, and then Mattson Tomlin, who's my writing partner, we began the process of this by doing another deep dive into the comics, exploring the ideas that I had had,” Reeves began.“He gave me some ideas that he had had. And we sat together and we watched a lot of movies, honestly, and not all movies that are from the realm of Gotham, just to explore where this story… because I knew that the way the movie ended it was leaving us on the precipice, and also the way events sort of happen within the show [The Penguin], that there is an exploration to be had. And one of the explorations for me was to do something that pushes even further into the character of Bruce Wayne, because the first story is so much about the Batman.“Let’s say we get to make 3 — I have no idea — but if we get to make 3, I always wanted the movies to be focused on his character. Once you get past the origin tale, which we didn't quite do but we did something that referred to his origins, then you start telling the rogues' gallery story and that character's arc. And I never wanted to lose Rob at the center of these stories. And so that is really what we set our aim on.“And so picking the right villain that digs into what that does, that goes into his past and his life, that was what drove that discussion. I won't tell you where we ended up, but we're super excited about it. And I will say it's never really been done in a movie before. So we're excited.”DC Universe: Every Upcoming Movie and TV ShowView 40 ImagesFans are coming up with all sorts of obscure Batman villains in response to Reeves’ comments, but it’s worth pointing out that he isn’t necessarily saying it’s a villain we’ve not seen in live-action form before, rather he may be making the point that we’ve never seen them realized in this way before. So, perhaps we’ll see a different take on Mr. Freeze, or Bane, or Poison Ivy, or Hugo Strange, or Scarecrow, or Two-Face. Will Barry Keoghan return as Joker in The Batman 2, after his cameo at the end of the first film? It really is hard to say at this stage.Here’s what we do know: Cristin Milioti, who won an Emmy for her role as Sofia Falcone in The Penguin, is not in The Batman 2. “We were so far along in the story, it might upset the apple cart given where the story goes and what we’re exploring,” Reeves explained.Clearly, it’s been quite the struggle for Reeves to get The Batman 2’s script into a place he was happy with. “It’s been a journey that is taking longer than I would’ve wanted for a lot of reasons, a lot of personal reasons,” Reeves recently told The Hollywood Reporter. “But [the] most important reason is getting it to a place where I just felt like it was the best script we could possibly write.”Reeves also spoke about where the HBO spinoff series The Penguin stands in terms of Season 2. “We’re in discussions. [Showrunner] Lauren [Lefranc] is thinking hard and we’re talking, so we’ll see,” he told Variety. “We love the show, and we think our cast is so incredible. The work that Lauren and the writers did was incredible. Our passion was in it, but never in our wildest dreams could we imagine it would have been received in the way that it was.”Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.
