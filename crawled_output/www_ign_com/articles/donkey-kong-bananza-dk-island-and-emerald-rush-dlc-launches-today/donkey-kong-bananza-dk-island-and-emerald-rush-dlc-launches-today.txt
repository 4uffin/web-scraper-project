It launches today via the Nintendo eShop, priced at $19.99.The add-on allows players to visit DK Island, a fresh area with some nostalgic nods to Donkey Kong's past, and a giant stone Kong face you can climb up or pummel through.This area features emerald, rather than the main game's familiar gold, which ties into the DLC's other main addition: the all-new Emerald Rush mode. This challenge option — which will then unlock after you've beaten the base game — sees you exploring DK Island and returning to other existing areas to amass emerald as fast as possible, with mini-goals set against the clock that will end your run early if you fail.Progress further in Emerald Rush and you'll be able to unlock new costumes for DK and Pauline, and collectable statues that you can use to customize your DK Island.For much more on the DLC, be sure to check out IGN's Donkey Kong Bananza: DK Island and Emerald Rush first hands-on impressions, which have just gone live.And finally, in other Donkey Kong Bananza news, a free demo of the main game will also be available on the Nintendo eShop later today, if you're yet to give this great adventure a try.Donkey Kong Bananza: DK Island and Emerald Rush DLC ScreenshotsView 31 ImagesDeveloped by members of the Super Mario Odyssey team, Donkey Kong Bananza launched for Nintendo Switch 2 back in July to universal delight among fans and critics alike.IGN's Donkey Kong Bananza review awarded the game a rare perfect score, and dubbed it "a truly groundbreaking 3D platformer, with satisfying movement, powerful abilities, impressive destructible environments, and clever challenges that all come together in complete harmony to create Nintendo’s first Switch 2 masterpiece."Today has been absolutely stuffed full of Nintendo news, including major announcements regarding Mario, Pokémon and Fire Emblem.
