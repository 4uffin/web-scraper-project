At various points on social media, Pitchford told people to “code your own engine and show us how it’s done, please,” and declare Borderlands 4 “a premium game made for premium gamers.” He also suggested people put their irrational distrust of video game graphics tech such as DLSS aside and use it if available to them.There’s plenty to dig into here, but ultimately what Pitchford is saying is that PC gamers should manage their expectations when it comes to the performance of Borderlands 4 in the context of their own rigs.“Every PC gamer must accept the reality of the relationship between their hardware and what the software they are running is doing,” he said, kicking off a thread clearly designed to address the performance issues that have sparked so much early discourse around Borderlands 4.“We have made an amazing and fun and huge looter shooter campaign game. The game is pretty damn optimal — which means that the software is doing what we want without wasteful cycles on bad processes.”Pitchford went on to insist that PC gamers have tools that help them balance their preferences between FPS, resolution, and rendering features, and they should make use of them. “If you aren’t happy with the balance between these things you are experiencing, please tune to your preferences using the tools available to you,” he said.Acknowledging everyone is entitled to an opinion, Pitchford insisted it was right for Gearbox to have focused on Borderlands 4’s default settings hitting 30fps on minimum specs, and 60fps on recommended specs.“Some of you would prefer more fps, or more features, or higher resolution. We have provided many tools to help you make those trade offs,” he continued.Borderlands' Vault Hunters, RankedBorderlands' Vault Hunters, Ranked     Then, in typical Randy Pitchford on the front foot fashion: “It is a mistake to believe or expect that PCs between minimum specification and recommended specification can achieve all of extremely high framerate, maximum/ultra features, and extremely high resolution.“If that last post makes you have a negative reaction, I bet you have emotions and expectations that you feel aren’t sufficiently attended to. I’m sorry.“But please accept that the game is doing a lot and running pretty optimally and that you may have to either accept some trade offs between fps, features and resolution as your preference or you will continue to be disappointed.”There’s more. Pitchford went on to advise PC gamers should make use of DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling), Nvidia’s AI-powered image enhancement and rendering technology for GeForce RTX GPUs, downplaying concern about input lag.“Use DLSS. It’s great,” he said. “The game was built to take advantage of it. This is not a competitive FPS. And, I have been led to believe that in a blind test that humans cannot detect any input lag. In my own demonstrates and experiments, I believe this is true.“Everyone has the freedom to believe what they want to believe and I know on the internet it’s easy to find rage and passionate people who are convinced of all kinds of things, whether they are true or not.“If you are so attached to the idea that DLSS is bad for your game experience because of something you saw or read on the internet, I am sorry. I hope instead you would use the technology designed to give you the experience you want.”Randy Pitchford has plenty to say about Borderlands 4 PC performance. Photo by Leon Bennett/Getty Images.There’s more, but the rest is pointing out Gearbox is continuing to improve Borderlands 4 and PC performance (there’s an update out although no-one knows what it did), and to thank players for their interest. There are also “a few real issues,” Gearbox is working to fix, but those affect “a very, very small percentage of users.”That’s just one social media thread from Pitchford. There are more on this issue. He tweeted to say customer service reports for Borderlands 4 are roughly 1% of installs, and 0.04% are PC performance related, with CS flagging 0.009% as “valid”
0.037% have experienced success with education (settings coaching).“That is less than one percent of one percent (0.01%) of customers using CS tickets for valid performance issues, which is less than 1/5 of the users using CS to get help with Twitch drops,” Pitchford explained.Then, the kicker: “This reality is dramatically different than what you would expect if your only sources of information were, say, certain internet threads.”“No such assumption made,” Pitchford added in response to one person who pointed out not everyone with PC issues files a ticket. “We are also looking at telemetry in real time regardless of what people report. There are people with low perf and we care about that. But 1% of 1 million is 10,000! Just 1,000 posts feels like everyone the way internet chatter works.”Earlier in the weekend, Pitchford suggested people dead set on playing in 4K resolution should perhaps consider playing at 1440p instead.“I know a lot of you are dead set on playing at 4k with ultra max settings and using two or three-year-old hardware,” he tweeted. “You do you, but BL4 and UE5 are doing a lot and for me that trade off for frames isn’t worth it. I play at 1440p with settings super high and am super happy with that trade off - the game looks amazing at 1440p.“If you’re not 4k stubborn and just want to have a great, fun time with higher perf, please consider running at 1440p resolution. If you’ve got a beast of a video card, you’re probably fine at 4k. But if you’re in the middle or close to min spec, I would definitely recommend making that trade.”Borderlands 4: All Vault Hunter Skill Trees RankedBorderlands 4: All Vault Hunter Skill Trees Ranked     And there are further quotes, perhaps betraying a touch of frustration from the Gearbox boss. Responding to one person who told Pitchford Gearbox would have been better off building the game for “the most common hardware,” he tweeted: “Borderlands 4 is a premium game made for premium gamers.”“The minimum and recommended specs are published,” he said. “The most common hardware is a four year old cell phone. Borderlands 4 is a premium game made for premium gamers. Just as Borderlands 4 cannot run on a PlayStation 4, it cannot be expected to run on too-old PC hardware. Unlike on PlayStation and Xbox, we cannot prevent a PC player with sub-optimal hardware for the game try to play it. So some try and get mad. And some have actual issues we need to fix. And some need to learn how their PC’s work at the high end for this specific game in 2025 and use the tools available to them to find the right balance between frame rate, resolution, and graphics features.“This is not a game made to run on 10-year-old PCs — this game uses the full capabilities of modern bus, CPU, and GPU. If you’re trying to drive a monster truck with a leaf blower’s motor, you’re going to be disappointed. If you discover your system can’t run the game well by accident or wishful thinking and/or don’t want to try to mess with settings to make things good enough for you, please use the refund feature on Steam rather than have a subpar experience.”And, responding to one person who said Gearbox should make Borderlands 4 “look good” without using AI upscaling technology, Pitchford hit back with a dose of sarcasm: “Code your own engine and show us how it’s done, please.
We will be your customer when you pull it off. The people doing it now are clearly dumb and don’t know what they’re doing and all the support and recommendations and code and architecture from the world’s greatest hardware companies and tech companies working with the world’s greatest real time graphics engine coders don’t know what you seem to know. /sarcasm”Borderlands 4 Review ScreenshotsView 159 ImagesBorderlands 4 launched last week and hit a peak of over 300,000 concurrent players on Steam alone — a figure significantly higher than any Borderlands game released on Valve’s platform. However, Steam reviews are ‘mixed,’ with most of the complaints revolving around PC performance.In response, Gearbox posted a Borderlands 4 Nvidia Optimization guide on Steam, advising players how to optimize their graphics settings for “better performance and framerates” on PC with the Nvidia app.Gearbox then issued a piece of advice to PC gamers that to me reads like an effort to prevent players from making knee-jerk reactions to the game's performance as soon as they’ve changed their settings: “Please note that any time you change any of your graphics settings, your shaders will need to recompile. Please keep playing for at least 15 minutes to see how your PC's performance has changed.”If you are delving into Borderlands 4, don't go without updated hourly SHiFT codes list.
