In other words, now's your chance to add this seasonally appropriate slasher to your physical media collection. The steelbook is set to release October 7, in time for Halloween, but you can put your preorder in for it right now at Amazon, Walmart, and Target. You'll want to be quick to pick it up, though, as these steelbooks have a tendency to sell out fast. Head to the link below to secure a copy for yourself now.Preorder I Know What You Did Last Summer 4K SteelbookOut October 7I Know What You Did Last Summer (4K UHD + Digital + Steelbook)0$48.49 at AmazonGet it at AmazonGet it at WalmartGet it at TargetThe cover of this steelbook features Madelyn Cline's character, Danica, in a very blood red bathtub, with the iconic fisherman's hook on the back cover. It comes with the film on 4K UHD, Blu-ray, and as a digital copy. At the moment, no bonus features have been revealed for it yet - which, again, makes sense given how recently the film opened in theaters - but we'll make sure to add them in once they're known. If you're on the hunt for even more 4K films to pick up for your library, there are plenty coming out over the next few months that are worth keeping on your radar. Our roundup of upcoming 4Ks and Blu-rays can point you towards a wide variety of movies and shows that are set to get physical releases, and there are so many worth checking out.
