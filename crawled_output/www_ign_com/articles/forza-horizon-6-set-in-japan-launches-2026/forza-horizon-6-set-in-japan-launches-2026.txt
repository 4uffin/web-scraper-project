"This has been the most-requested location since the very first game and we can't wait to share more next year."Playground Games art director Don Arceta and cultural consultant Kyoko Yamashita spoke with IGN ahead of today's announcement, discussing the decision to finally send the series to Japan, and how Forza Horizon 6's Tokyo City will probably be the "most complex and intricate space of drivable area in a Horizon game yet."An Xbox Wire blog post on the game's announcement goes into more detail on why Japan has been chosen now specifically, with Arceta revealing that recent technical advances had made the game possible."The beauty of Horizon games is that each one gives us learnings and ways to make the next even bigger and better," Arceta said. "As well as taking player feedback into account, we’ve also been able to lean into more practical things – for instance, the Forza Horizon 5 Hot Wheels DLC has helped us develop the elevated roads of Tokyo City in FH6.”As evidenced from today's teaser, the game will mix Tokyo's urban environment with a sample of Japan's rural areas, including Mount Fuji. The series' usual seasonal changes will also return, Arceta confirmed. ORIGINAL STORY: Forza Horizon 6, the next entry in Microsoft's racing series, will be set in Japan and launch in 2026.Microsoft made the announcement via a post on Instagram, which has gone live several hours before today's big Xbox Tokyo Game Show broadcast.The post shows a brief teaser for Forza Horizon 6, confirming its setting and release year. "The Horizon Festival is heading to Japan," reads a caption. "Coming 2026. Wishlist now!" Logos confirm the game will be an Xbox Play Anywhere title, and unsurprisingly also launch on Xbox Game Pass.While today's announcement looks to have gone live a little early, nothing from today's announcement comes as much of a surprise. Microsoft gaming chief Phil Spencer previously confirmed a fresh entry in the Forza series would launch in 2026, and with Forza Motorsport's team reportedly gutted in the company's recent layoffs, it seemed obvious this referred to a fresh Forza Horizon entry instead.Forza fans have also had their eye on Japan for a while, as well — particularly after a teasing social media post last month from a car import company connected to the game.Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
