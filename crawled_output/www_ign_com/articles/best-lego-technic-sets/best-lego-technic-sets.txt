More rods, beams, and pins.Ever since LEGO's slow pivot to adult-targeted sets, the separation between traditional LEGO bricks and LEGO Technic – the rods, beams, pins, and gears that builders use to create simple machines – has become increasingly blurred. Nowadays, one is often an accompaniment to the other. Technic creates a sturdy skeleton, and the bricks form a decorative shell around it, which gives the model its form and outward appearance.TL;DR - These Are the Best LEGO Technic SetsLEGO Technic Planet Earth and Moon in Orbit4See it at AmazonLEGO Ducati Panigale V4 S Motorcycle0See it at AmazonLEGO Ferrari FXX K0See it at AmazonLEGO Volvo FMX Truck & EC230 Electric Excavator3See it at AmazonLEGO Technic Liebherr Crawler Crane LR 130003See it at AmazonLEGO Technic McLaren Formula 1 Race Car0See it at LEGO StoreLEGO Technic Mercedes-AMG F1 W14 E Performance0See it at LEGO StoreLEGO Mercedes-Benz G 500 PROFESSIONAL Line1See it at AmazonLEGO Technic Lamborghini Sián FKP 372See it at AmazonLEGO Technic Mars Crew Exploration Rover4See it at AmazonIt's a product of LEGO's ambition – that the builds got so massive that the designers needed an underlying structure to stabilize them. It also eased many LEGO fans into a whole new sub-genre of building techniques, and if you're one of those fans, you might want to check out a proper LEGO Technic set, which do away with the bricks almost entirely. It's become one of the most popular LEGO themes available in 2025.Here are the best LEGO Technic sets that you can purchase in 2025.LEGO Technic Planet Earth and Moon in OrbitLEGO Technic Planet Earth and Moon in Orbit4See it at AmazonSet: #42179Age Range: 10+Piece Count: 526Dimensions: 9 inches high, 12.5 inches long, 7 inches widePrice: $74.99This is a welcome diversion for the Technic line, which typically focuses on vehicles but broadened its scope with this set: a movable model of the sun, Earth, and moon. You turn a crank, and the heavenly bodies rotate and revolve around each other, in sync with the month and the moon phases. It's one of the coolest LEGO space sets you can buy right now.Ferrari FXX KLEGO Ferrari FXX K0See it at AmazonSet: #42212Age Range: 10+Piece Count: 897Dimensions: 3 inches high, 11 inches long, 4.5 inches widePrice: $64.99For the longest time, the LEGO Technic sets were either too simple or too expensive. But now, there's a
a mid-priced series of Technic cars, starting with this one: a model of a Ferrari FXX K, with butterfly doors and a V12 engine. If you're not feeling this one, you might also want to check out the Cheverolet Corvette Stingray, which comes in either yellow or blue.Ducati Panigale V4 S MotorcycleLEGO Ducati Panigale V4 S Motorcycle0See it at AmazonSet: #42202Age Range: 18+Piece Count: 1603Dimensions: 11.5 inches high, 16.5 inches long, 5.5 inches widePrice: $199.99Depicting the crown jewel of the Ducati motorcycle line, this set comes with a three-speed gear box and a chain that loops to model's back wheel, along with front and rear suspension. The bright-red color scheme is sure to stand out on any shelf or in any display case.LEGO Volvo FMX Truck & EC230 Electric ExcavatorLEGO Volvo FMX Truck & EC230 Electric Excavator3See it at AmazonSet: #42175Age Range: 10+Piece Count: 2274Dimensions: 3 inches high, 26.5 inches long, 5 inches widePrice: $199.99You get two builds for the price of one. First is a flatbed truck. You can lower its ramp and tilt the cabin back to reveal a 6-cylinder piston engine. Second is an excavator, which connects to a charging station and operates via pneumatic pump. You can play with both vehicles together – with the excavator resting on the flatbed – or separately. For the high prices that LEGO charges, it's nice to get some quantity along with the quality, and the Volvo FMX Truck & EC230 Electric Excavator feels like a bargain for its size and piece count. LEGO Technic Liebherr Crawler Crane LR 13000LEGO Technic Liebherr Crawler Crane LR 130003See it at AmazonSet: #42146Age Range: 18+Piece Count: 2883Dimensions: 39 inches high, 43 inches long, 11 inches widePrice: $699.99Its price is something to gasp at considering it's one of the most expensive LEGO sets. But for that money, you do get a massive, working crane that you can control remotely with your cell phone. It rolls on treads, and thanks to counterweights, it can lift a considerable amount of weight relative to its size. Just make sure you plan ahead; it's over three feet tall, and you can't put it on a shelf once you're done playing with it. It's worth comparing it to the actual real-life crane its based off too because it looks exactly like it.See Cheaper Options Like This:LEGO Technic Heavy-Duty Bulldozer3See it at AmazonLEGO Technic Backhoe Loader3See it at AmazonLEGO Technic Heavy-Duty Excavator3See it at AmazonLEGO Technic John Deere5See it at AmazonLEGO Technic McLaren Formula 1 Race CarLEGO Technic McLaren Formula 1 Race Car0See it at LEGO StoreSet: #42141Age Range: 18+Piece Count: 1434Dimensions: 5 inches high, 25.5 inches long, 10.5 inches widePrice: $199.99Created in close collaboration with the team at McLaren Racing, this is a replica of the car that raced during the 2022 Formula 1 season. Open it up, and it has a V6 cylinder engine with differential, pistons, steering, and suspension. It even comes with sponsor stickers, if you want to give the model that 'race day' feel.LEGO Technic Mercedes-AMG F1 W14 E PerformanceLEGO Technic Mercedes-AMG F1 W14 E Performance0See it at LEGO StoreSet: #42171Age Range: 18+Piece Count: 1642Dimensions: 5 inches high, 25 inches long, 10 inches widePrice: $219.99This race car comes equipped with two pullback motors, which can be manually triggered by a person's hand or foot.

It has all the extras expected in a supercar, from the butterfly doors that open upwards and outwards, to the 8-speed transmission and movable gearshift, to the V12 engine. Other supercars in this price range include the Ferrari Daytona SP3 and the McLaren P1.LEGO Technic Mars Crew Exploration RoverLEGO Technic Mars Crew Exploration Rover4See it at AmazonSet: #40618Age Range: 10+Piece Count: 1599Dimensions: 9 inches high, 17 inches long, 8 inches widePrice: $149.99And now, here's something a little out of this world. This manned LEGO Mars rover doesn't exist in real life yet, but it's a wonderful aspiration, and it comes with a truck bed, a crane, and a cramped if well-appointed living quarters, which includes a shower, toilet, and treadmill. If you're in the mood for something space-geared more reality-based, try this replica of the Nasa Apollo Lunar vehicle.How Many LEGO Technic Sets are There?There are 57 LEGO Technic sets listed on the official LEGO store as of September 2025.LEGO Technic has evolved rapidly in the last several years.
