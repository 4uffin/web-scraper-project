Not only that, it has a release date: September 8, 2026 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and S, and PC via Steam and Epic Games Store.IllFonic is best known for its asymmetric multiplayer horror games Killer Klowns From Outer Space: The Game, Friday the 13th: The Game, and Predator Hunting Grounds, but Halloween has single-player and multiplayer modes.Here’s the official blurb:Death comes to Haddonfield in Halloween, a chilling tribute to the iconic John Carpenter’s classic film. Survive or slay across the tense streets and dark corners of Haddonfield in this asymmetrical horror sandbox, taking on the role of either a desperate Civilian or the infamous Michael Myers himself. In each high-stakes cat-and-mouse match, every decision means life or death.As a Civilian, protect the townsfolk by guiding them to safety, scavenging for weapons and supplies, and finding a phone to call the police before it’s too late. Danger lurks around every corner, and survival depends on strategy, teamwork, and quick thinking. Meanwhile, Michael Myers stalks the shadows, using terrifying abilities like Shape Jump to move unseen across the map and strike without warning in a heart-pounding experience.For more, check out IGN’s interview with IllFonic on Halloween from August.
