Other discounted games include Cyberpunk 2077, Mario Kart World, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, and Breath of the Wild, with the additional discount automatically applied during checkout.Used: Like NewDonkey Kong Bananza - Switch 24$69.99 save 24%$53.24 at AmazonUsed: Like NewThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom - Switch 2 Edition1$76.63 save 20%$61.31 at AmazonUsed: Like NewThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild - Switch 2 Edition1$65.57 save 20%$52.50 at AmazonUsed: Like NewCyberpunk 2077 - Switch 21$69.99 save 30%$48.97 at AmazonUsed: GoodMario Kart World - Switch 23$74.99 save 24%$56.92 at AmazonSo what's the catch? These are technically sold under Amazon Resale. Now hold your eye rolls, as we've seen deals like this before, and these discounts are some of the IGN Deals team's most anticipated offers going into the biggest sale period of the year. Most of what I'm recommending in the sale is classified as "Used - Like New," essentially what Amazon deems almost brand new, never used, with small damage to the packaging, but not to the contents themselves. So you're not losing anything, or buying a game that looks like it's been recently run over repeatedly. We've also already noted some PlayStation deals at Amazon Resale, with the PS Portal dropping to around $140 (but now sold out), and the DualSense Edge controller, also down to around $140 right now (also likely to sell out soon). In case you hadn't already realised, the main with kind of deals is stock tends to be extremely limited, so be fast to the trigger if you don't want the disappointment of missing out.Used: Like NewDualSense Wireless Controller - Chroma Teal1$79.99 save 29%$56.79 at AmazonUsed: Like NewXbox Wireless Controller - Pulse Cipher Special Edition1$64.99 save 32%$44.42 at AmazonUsed: Like NewPlayStation Portal2$199.99 save 30%$140.41 at AmazonUsed: Like NewPS5 DualSense Edge Wireless Controller0$140.41 at AmazonThis is one of the best ways to buy into some of the most expensive new games available, and find rare discounts where you normally wouldn't (I'm looking at you, Nintendo). Plus, you still get the 30-day Amazon return policy, so it's still a much safer option than just buying a used game off some random on Facebook Marketplace.If you're looking for more Switch 2 game deals, we also recently covered discounts on other games sold by Amazon this week (not resale either), including Split Fiction, Sonic x Shadow Generations, Madden NFL 26, and more.Nintendo Switch 2 Split Fiction7$49.99 save 6%$46.99 at AmazonNintendo Switch 2 Sonic x Shadow Generations4$49.99 save 20%$39.88 at AmazonNintendo Switch 2 Civilization VII1$69.99 save 14%$59.99 at AmazonNintendo Switch 2 Bravely Default Flying Fairy HD Remastered4$74.94 save 33%$49.95 at AmazonNintendo Switch 2 Madden NFL 262$69.99 save 29%$49.99 at AmazonNintendo Switch 2 Hogwarts Legacy2$59.99 save 18%$49.30 at AmazonNintendo Switch 2 Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S2$39.99 save 25%$29.83 at AmazonNintendo Switch 2 Yakuza 0: Director’s Cut3$49.99 save 20%$39.88 at AmazonNintendo Switch 2 Raidou Remastered4$49.99 save 30%$34.99 at AmazonNintendo Switch 2 Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma2$69.00 save 14%$59.50 at AmazonHow to Follow IGN Deals RecommendationsThe IGN Deals team has over 30 years of combined experience finding the best discounts and preorders available online.
