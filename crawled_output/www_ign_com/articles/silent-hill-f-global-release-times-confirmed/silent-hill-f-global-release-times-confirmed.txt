As displayed at the beginning of the Japanese-language reveal trailer back in March, it is the first Silent Hill game to get an 18+ rating certification in Japan. It's out for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series on September 25.IGN's Silent Hill f review returned a 7/10. We said: "Silent Hill f presents a fresh new setting to explore and a fascinatingly dark story to unravel, but its melee-focussed combat takes a big swing that doesn’t quite land."In case you're wondering, no, Silent Hill f is not a sequel to any of the existing Silent Hill games, so you can play it even if you've never jumped into a Silent Hill game before. Instead, it will offer a standalone story "independent from the series." For most, Silent Hill f will unlock on September 25 at the times listed below, but those who pre-order the digital deluxe edition can play two days early from September 23.
