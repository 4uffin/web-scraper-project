Additions to both games for these new versions include boosted resolution (up to 4K on Switch 2), an improved UI, a new in-game music player, and the option to play using button and stick or motion controls.Out October 2Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 241$69.99 at AmazonMost intriguingly, these fresh additions will include additional pages of Rosalina's in-game storybook — which contains some very interesting lore for the character.Nintendo legend Shigeru Miyamoto announced the two games' return today during the company's major Nintendo Direct, which also offered a first look at The Super Mario Galaxy Movie, the upcoming sequel to the smash-hit Super Mario Movie that's due to launch next spring. Could these new Super Mario Galaxy story pages tie into The Super Mario Galaxy Movie's plot, somehow? For now, Nintendo is keeping story details of the film under wraps, but we wouldn't be surprised.For those who've yet to play the Galaxy games, their execellent gravity-defying gameplay remains the pinnacle of the 3D Mario franchise for many. The titles also included — rarely, for Nintendo — something of a story, detailing space princess Rosalina's past. See our Super Mario Galaxy 1+2 preorder guide for more info.Super Mario Galaxy and Super Mario Galaxy 2 GalleryView 16 ImagesAccompanying the release will be a pair of new Super Mario Galaxy amiibo, which will offer additional in-game items. Mario & Luma can be scanned in either game to receive a Life Mushroom, while Rosalina & Lumas will give you a 1-Up Mushroom.The first statuette features Mario being flung through a Warp Star, as a Luma chases behind. The second features Rosalina, reading from her storybook and surrounded by two Lumas. These amiibo will arrive a little later, on April 2, 2026 — around the time we're expecting The Super Mario Galaxy Movie to arrive in theaters. A hardcover book version of Rosalina's storybook will also be available, though it will not contain the new story content added in the games' Switch versions.Other announcements including sponsorship of the Kyoto Marathon 2026 and a fresh design for the Nintendo Museum ticket.Today has been absolutely stuffed full of Nintendo news, including major announcements regarding Zelda, Pokémon and Fire Emblem.
