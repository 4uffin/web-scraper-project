The flagship tablet - the reMarkable Paper Pro - accurately mimics the sensation of writing on real paper thanks to a combination of a textured display, instantly responsive E-ink technology, and a custom-designed pressure-sensitive pen. However, with a spacious 12" screen size, the Paper Pro can be a bit cumbersome to carry around on a daily basis. Fortunately, reMarkable was aware of this and just released a smaller, more pocketable version, dubbed the reMarkable Paper Pro Move. It features all of the technologies that make the Paper Pro great and acts as the perfect paper replacement, but with a more compact 7" screen size.New Release: reMarkable Paper Pro Move Digital NotebookPRESENTED BY:reMarkableNew ReleasereMarkable Paper Pro Move Digital Notebook4$449.00 at reMarkableThe reMarkable Paper Pro Move was officially unveiled on September 3. It starts at $449 for the basic model with the standard Model Marker and no folio. Options include a more advanced Model Marker Plus and a slim folio made of your choice of mosaic weave, polymer weave, or premium leather. Since the Paper Pro Move is priced $130 less than its full-sized sibling, it's potentially a better option for anyone who hasn't owned a digital notebook and wants to test the waters.The Paper Pro Move is a compact tablet that measures 7.7" long, 4.26" wide, and only 0.26" thin. As a comparison, it's very similar in size to the newest Apple iPad Mini. It's also lightweight at just over 8 ounces. The display is made of textured glass and the chassis is mostly aluminum. The 7.3" Canvas Color display is based off E-Ink Gallery 3 technology with a 1696x954 resolution. That averages out to a respectable pixel density of 264ppi, which is necessary to produce crisp and clear text. The display also features adjustable front-lit illumination for reading in dim conditions. The battery lasts up to two weeks, but if it ends up being depleted and you're in a rush, a 10 minute top-up will give you three days of power.reMarkable's claim to fame is in its writing capabilities. The Paper Pro Move also does a superb job of mimicking the feel of pen on paper. The Model Marker stylus simulates nine different writing tools - including ballpoint pens, markers, and highlighters - for you to choose from. The Model Marker Plus adds on eraser functionality. Handwritten notes are accurately translated into typed text with a single tap. Unlike physical media, you'll never run out of paper and you'll be able to resize, undo, cut, copy, or create perfect lines and circles to your heart's content.When you're done, reMarkable makes it easy to file your notes away in an efficient and legible manner. The Paper Pro Move comes pre-loaded with a variety of lined and dotted templates, to-do lists, and weekly planners to keep your thoughts organized. Your finished notes can be sorted into separate folders and tagged for easy search queries. Your notes are saved in the cloud and accessible from other devices through reMarkable's mobile and desktop apps. Both locally stored and cloud files are encrypted, but you can also set up an optional passcode if you need more security.Is the reMarkable Paper Pro Move a good e-reader option?Although reMarkable's digital notebooks are unsurpassed in their digital writing functionality, they're not really the best option if you're purely looking for a universally compatible digital reader. That's because you cannot easily view MOBI/AZW or DRM-protected EPUB content. That includes any eBooks available on Amazon Kindle as well as Libby, which is used by most public libraries. The reMarkable OS also doesn't support third party apps, so there's no way to download a Kindle or Libby app like you would on a standard tablet or mobile device. As we stated in our 2025 list of the best e-ink tablets, "The Remarkable Paper Pro is the perfect paper replacement with bold colors and best-in-class handwriting." However, if you're looking strictly for an e-reader, then you're best off sticking with a Kindle tablet, Apple iPad, or your smartphone.How to Follow IGN Deals RecommendationsThe IGN Deals team has over 30 years of combined experience finding the best discounts and preorders available online.
