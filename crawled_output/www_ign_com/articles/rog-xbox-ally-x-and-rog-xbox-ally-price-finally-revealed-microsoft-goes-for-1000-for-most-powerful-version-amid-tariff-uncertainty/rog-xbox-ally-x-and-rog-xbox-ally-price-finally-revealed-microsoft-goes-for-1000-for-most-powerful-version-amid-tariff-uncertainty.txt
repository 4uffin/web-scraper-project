At gamescom in August, Microsoft and Asus told IGN the companies still needed "more time to figure out the macro-economic impact to pricing,” a statement issued amid frequently shifting market conditions fuelled by ever-changing U.S. tariffs."This is always a challenge," Jason Ronald, Microsoft's vice president of Xbox gaming devices and ecosystem, told IGN last month, "and you always try to find the right balance between affordability and price point, and I think especially in a mobile form factor that also adds in dimensions such as battery life in as well. And then, as you said, the macro-economic climate is challenging.""I think we will have to... we need more time to figure the macro-economic impact to pricing, and that's why we'll be sharing more later, in September and October," Asus senior vice president Shawn Yen added.As part of the same interview, we also asked Ronald about Microsoft's internal plans to make a first-party Xbox handheld, following a report that suggested the idea had been sidelined.The ROG Xbox Ally X and ROG Xbox Ally launch into an increasingly competitive market for handheld gaming hardware, with the cheaper Steam Deck and Nintendo Switch 2 now firmly entrenched. Meanwhile, Microsoft has come under fire for repeatedly hiking the price of its Xbox hardware. Just last week, Microsoft announced that Xbox console prices would go up once again in the U.S. after already rising back in May.Microsoft said the Xbox console price increases occurred "due to changes in the macro-economic environment," and added that in the future, it would "continue to focus on offering more ways to play more games across any screen and providing value for Xbox players.”This move comes as many video game companies are raising prices on everything from consoles to accessories to games, with price hikes affecting the U.S. in particular amid ongoing tariff fluctuation and uncertainty. Last month, Sony implemented a price increase in the U.S. on its hardware, and after releasing its Nintendo Switch 2 at $450, Nintendo raised the price on its original Switch 1 and various accessories as well. Video games and subscriptions are being impacted: Xbox raised its prices for Game Pass earlier this year, Mario Kart Tour launched at an unheard-of $80, and Xbox announced it would also introduce $80 games this holiday, though it backtracked on that decision shortly after.We've previously spoken to expert analysts about the rising prices of all gaming items, and they explained that the increases are likely occurring due to a mixture of increased manufacturing costs, competition, and U.S. tariffs, with the latter particular relevant in cases where prices are climbing in the U.S. and nowhere else.The Entertainment Software Association (ESA) has issued statements on the impact of tariffs in the U.S., with ESA spokesperson Aubrey Quinn telling IGN in April: "There's going to be a real impact regardless of company. This is company-agnostic, this is an entire industry. There's going to be an impact on the entire industry.”ROG Xbox Ally X and ROG Xbox Ally prices globally:ROG Xbox Ally X: $999.99 / £799 / €899 (ERP)ROG Xbox Ally: $599.99 / £499 / €599 (ERP)Alongside its pricing announcement, Microsoft has opened up pre-orders for both the ROG Xbox Ally X and ROG Xbox Ally through the Microsoft Store, ASUS eshop, and select global retailers in 38 countries.Here’s the official blurb on the ROG Xbox Ally X and ROG Xbox Ally from Microsoft:One of our core goals with the Xbox Ally was to deliver a distinctly Xbox experience in the palm of your hands.
