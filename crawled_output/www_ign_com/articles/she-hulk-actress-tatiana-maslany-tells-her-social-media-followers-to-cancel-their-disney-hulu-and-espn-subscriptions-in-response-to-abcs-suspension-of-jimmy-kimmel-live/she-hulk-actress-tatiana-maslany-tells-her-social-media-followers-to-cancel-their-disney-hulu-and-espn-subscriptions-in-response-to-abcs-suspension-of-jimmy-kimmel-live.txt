ABC axed the show after the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) threatened regulatory action, raising concerns the Trump administration is curtailing the free speech of its critics.In his monologue on Monday, the 57-year-old Kimmel said the "Maga gang" was "desperately trying to characterise this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them" and trying "everything they can" to "score political points from it.”He also compared Trump's reaction to Kirk’s death to "how a four-year-old mourns a goldfish.” Kimmel had condemned the attack and sent "love" to the Kirk family following the shooting.Jimmy Kimmel claims "We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it" and "This is not how an adult… pic.twitter.com/KMhnskaYWD— Alex Christy (@alexchristy17) September 16, 2025 FCC chair Brendan Carr accused Kimmel of "the sickest conduct possible" and said networks like the Disney-owned ABC could "find ways to change conduct and take action... or there's going to be additional work for the FCC.”Now, actress Tatiana Maslany, who played She-Hulk in the Disney+ spinoff She-Hulk: Attorney at Law for its one and only season, has called for a boycott of the streamer. In a post on Instagram, Maslany urged her half a million followers to cancel their Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN subscriptions in response to the suspension, using a behind-the-scenes photo from her time filming She-Hulk reinforce her involvement. Disney is yet to respond.Tatiana Maslany's social media post.

"If it isn’t, I can’t in good conscience work for the company that imposed it."Sorry to Bother You writer and director Boots Riley tweeted to say that if members of the Directors Guild of America refused to show up for any ABC / Disney / Hulu / Marvel show until Kimmel was reinstated, "they'll reverse the decision within hours AT MOST."U.S. President Donald Trump has now suggested some TV networks opposed to him should have their licences "taken away.”As reported by the BBC, Trump spoke about the issue to journalists aboard Air Force One on Thursday while returning from a state visit to the UK."I have read some place that the networks were 97% against me, again, 97% negative, and yet I won and easily [in last year's election]," Trump said."They give me only bad publicity [and] press. I mean, they're getting a licence. I would think maybe their licence should be taken away."Tatiana Maslany starred as She-Hulk in the 2022 Disney+ show.

Then, this week, Comedy Central delayed its planned new episode of South Park just hours before it was due to air.
