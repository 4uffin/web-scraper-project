Home to culture-forming shows (Games of Thrones, The Last of Us, The Sopranos, etc.) and movie sagas (The Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, Mad Max, the DC Universe, the Dune Saga, etc.), HBO Max continues to be one of the best streaming services out there. As streaming has evolved throughout the years, streaming services have also been changing in structure, content rights, and pricing. Despite the increase in competition, HBO Max does not currently offer a free trial. So if you're hoping to hop on really quick just to watch the new Superman movie without paying anything, you're out of luck.That being said, HBO Max and Disney have joined forces to create a new affordable super-bundle that gives users access to HBO Max, Disney+, and Hulu in one billing cycle.
