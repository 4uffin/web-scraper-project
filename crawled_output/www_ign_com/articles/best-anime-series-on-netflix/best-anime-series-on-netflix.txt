No longer do we have to order four episodes of Sailor Moon on VHS from the back of a catalog, or struggle to find simulcasts for our newest favorite series.Now, thanks to the ever-growing fandom and their passionate love of anime, pretty much every streamer is making sure they have an impressive array of offerings. Netflix – which has become one of the go-to spaces for brilliant new anime like Sakamoto Days, classic series like One Piece, and everything in between – has ensured that it remains part of the anime-centric conversation. That's why each month I'm here to recommend the best of what Netflix has to offer when it comes to the genre. From gangster slices of life to alien invasions, and campaign fantasies to viking sagas, there's a reason that Netflix is known as one of the best streaming services for anime lovers. Note: This list applies to U.S. Netflix subscribers. Some titles may not currently be available on international platforms (yet). This list will also be periodically amended to remove series no longer available on Netflix, as well as add new anime shows available for streaming on the service.Best Anime to Watch on NetflixView 15 ImagesDan Da Dan Season 2NetflixYukinobu Tatsu's smash hit manga became one of the biggest anime releases of the year when it hit screens in 2024.

Silly, entertaining, and heartwarming, Sakamoto Days stands out among other crime anime, channeling contemporary series like Spy x Family far more than your serious classics like Golgo 13.

This is a story of love, war, and revolution, and at less than two hours, the movie has to condense a lot of the story to fit in the major beats. That makes it a great jumping-on point for new viewers, and a fun, breezy watch that won't add months of TV to your watchlist. Devil May CryNetflixThis long-awaited adaptation of the smash hit Hideki Kamiya-created Capcom game is definitely worth the wait. The series follows a handsome and charming demon hunter named Dante (Johnny Yong Bosch) as he attempts to stop a mysterious villain dead set on opening the gates of Hell. “Our goal wasn’t just to pump out another animated show," showrunner and exec producer Adi Shankar told Netflix's Tudum website.
"My goal is to make one of the best shows on the Netflix platform — period." With the series already renewed for a second season, it's the perfect time to dig into Netflix's latest big-budget dive into original anime. Witch WatchNetflixWhen the descendant of an ogre named Morihito befriends a young witch named Nico, both of their lives are changed forever.

Vinland Saga Crunchyroll/NetflixWe voted the second season of this stunning Viking saga our best anime of 2023. This adaptation of Makoto Yukimura's fan-favorite manga pulls no punches in portraying the brutality of war and the Viking era. At its heart is Thorfinn, a man on a mission of vengeance after a tragic loss. What really makes this show stand out is how unafraid it is to change tone, shift the shape of the show, and explore the horrors of war from every side, leading to an intriguingly different Season 2. Mature, resonant, and often moving, this is the kind of series that could become a prestige TV lover's favorite anime. And if you're just here for the Viking drama, gore, and action, you'll be satisfied too. The Apothecary DiariesCrunchyroll/NetflixOne of 2024's breakout series was this wonderful mystery, which takes the procedural crime of the week format and throws it back in time to Imperial China, where a young woman is swept up from the streets into the court intrigue of the palace. Luckily, thanks to her training as an apothecary, she's uniquely suited to surviving the dangerous corridors of power. With an enticing setup, a charming lead, and a gorgeously animated world to lose yourself in, this is a delightful surprise of an anime that will hook you instantly and keep your attention until the very last moment before the credits roll.Thus Spoke Rohan Kishibe NetflixIf you're already caught up with the supremely popular adaptation of Hirohiko Araki's manga, then worry not, as you can also watch the creepy Rohan Kishibe spin-off mini-series, Thus Spoke Rohan Kishibe, on the streamer too. Essentially a horror-themed series inspired by the famed in-universe manga artist's supernatural adventures, this will work for you if you're a fan of The Conjuring or The X-Files and are looking for a fun and decidedly spooky anime series to sate that nee. And it's only four episodes long! Pluto NetflixNaoki Urasawa and Takashi Nagasaki have long been one of the best collaborative forces in manga, and this adaptation of one of the story arcs from Pluto: Urasawa × Tezuka showcases why. Taking the sci-fi world of Astro Boy and melding it with a noir-hued murder mystery makes this a great jumping-on point for new viewers. The series follows a detective who must solve the killings of powerful robots. This release may have slipped under the radar when it hit in 2023, but it's still one of the best anime of the last few years, and at only eight episodes, it's an easy breezy watch compared to classic series like One Piece or Naruto, which are hundreds of episodes in already.
