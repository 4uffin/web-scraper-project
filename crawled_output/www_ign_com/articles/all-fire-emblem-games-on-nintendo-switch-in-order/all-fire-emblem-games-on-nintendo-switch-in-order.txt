Through its ever-evolving combat and the introduction of beloved character bonding mechanics, the series has ascended to the upper echelon of tactical RPGs, culminating in two excellent mainline entries on the Nintendo Switch.As we near the end of the original Switch era, we’ve compiled a list of every Fire Emblem game available on the console as well as what's coming to the Switch 2. How Many Fire Emblem Games Are on Switch?There are five Fire Emblem games on Switch: two mainline games and three spinoffs. There are three additional Fire Emblem games available with Nintendo Switch Online, though Path of Radiance is only available to Switch 2 owners with the Expansion Pack.Fire Emblem Warriors4See it at AmazonFire Emblem: Three Houses8See it at AmazonTokyo Mirage Session #FE Encore5See it at AmazonFire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes6See it at AmazonFire Emblem Engage 4See it at AmazonEvery Fire Emblem Game on Nintendo SwitchFire Emblem Warriors (2017)The first Fire Emblem game released on Switch was the Dynasty Warriors crossover Fire Emblem Warriors. The mashup incorporates the best elements of each series, blending Fire Emblem’s team-based strategy with Dynasty Warriors’ button-mashing, hack-and-slash action. It’s a worthwhile spinoff for action fans, though the light story makes it inessential to those concerned with Fire Emblem lore.The game was developed by Dynasty Warriors studio Omega Force in collaboration with the action gurus at Team Ninja (Ninja Gaiden, Nioh).Fire Emblem WarriorsOmega ForceSep 30, 2017+1Rate this gameRelated GuidesOverviewWalkthroughCharactersUniverseFire Emblem: Three Houses (2019)Fire Emblem: Three Houses was a milestone release for the series. It was the first Fire Emblem game released on a home console in 12 years, the first mainline entry released on Switch, and a critical and commercial success that carried forward the momentum of Awakening seven years before it.
Three Houses is a massive tactical RPG that balances the grand with the intimate. Large-scale battles progress an overarching story of politics and religion within a continental war, while quieter moments between battles are spent in the monastery training, teaching, exploring, and bonding with other characters through well-written and -acted conversations.Three Houses is Fire Emblem at its best, and what we'd recommend as a starting point if you’re looking to jump into the series on Switch.Fire Emblem: Three HousesIntelligent SystemsJul 26, 2019Rate this gameRelated GuidesOverviewNew FeaturesWhich House Should You ChooseEssential Tips for Teaching, the Monastery, Battle, and MoreTokyo Mirage Sessions #FE Encore (2020)In 2020, Nintendo released Tokyo Mirage Sessions #FE Encore, an expanded port of the original Wii U release. Encore added new story content, characters, and music to the Nintendo-Atlus crossover game, which blends Fire Emblem’s “weapon triangle” combat mechanic — swords have an advantage over axes, axes over lances, lances over swords — with the flashy style, dungeon-crawling, and moment-to-moment combat of Atlus’s Shin Megami Tensei and Persona games.The story is a comical, often over-the-top send-up of Japanese pop-culture that, as in Warriors before it, takes a backseat to the action.Tokyo Mirage Sessions #FE EncoreAtlusJan 17, 2020Rate this gameRelated GuidesOverviewWhat is Tokyo Mirage Sessions?WalkthroughSide StoriesFire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes (2023)Nintendo re-teamed with Omega Force for Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes, the companies’ second Fire Emblem-Dynasty Warriors crossover following Fire Emblem Warriors. Three Hopes is a retelling of Three Houses set in an alternate timeline where Three Houses’ protagonist Byleth serves as the main villain.Three Hopes is a more robust blend of the two franchises than its predecessor, integrating more of Fire Emblem’s social and tactical mechanics with Dynasty Warriors’ fast-paced action.Fire Emblem Warriors: Three HopesOmega ForceJun 23, 2022Rate this gameRelated GuidesOverviewWalkthroughExpeditions GuideGift Guide - All Favorite GiftsFire Emblem Engage (2023)Fire Emblem Engage is the series’ latest game and its second mainline entry on Switch. Engage is a progression of Three Houses’ excellence and an ode to Fire Emblem's past: It refines and scales down the social and hub mechanics of Three Houses while shifting its primary focus to the series’ longstanding tactical combat, most notably reintroducing Fire Emblem’s “weapon triangle" system.The story of Engage follows a Divine Dragon named Alear, who’s tasked with collecting 12 rings to defeat the Fell Dragon and save the continent of Elyos. Engage’s original story connects to the series past through these 12 rings, each of which houses the spirit of a past Fire Emblem protagonist, allowing you to summon past heroes such as Marth, Ike, Celica, and Byleth.Fire Emblem EngageIntelligent SystemsJan 20, 2023Rate this gameRelated GuidesOverviewNew Features in Fire Emblem EngageBeginner's GuideTips and TricksFire Emblem Games Available With Nintendo Switch OnlineNintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack: 12-Month Individual Membership12See it at AmazonThere are currently two Fire Emblem games available with a Nintendo Switch Online subscription outside of Japan: the 2003 Game Boy Advance game Fire Emblem, aka Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade, and the 2004 follow-up Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones.
