It's called Death Stranding: Mosquito and, per Kojima and animation director Hiroshi Miyamoto's own words, it follows the story of a guy who sucks.We got a look at a snippet of animation from Mosquito, showing a man with something stuck to his face that has a weird tentacle thing coming out of it. He's in the water at the beginning of the clip, swimming and approaching something human-shaped that's difficult to make out. But in the second part of the clip, he's on land, in the Timefall, fighting a guy in a porter suit, still with the gooey thing on his face.That's it! Who is this guy, and what does all this mean? No idea! We do find out from a follow-up conversation with Kojima and Miyamoto that the word "Mosquito" refers to the main character, who can suck...something. Not blood! Just something. We'll find out later.It was also revealed that Mosquito is being animated with hand-drawn lines that are then digitally used to assemble the animation itself. And Studio Easter, which worked on Dandadan, is doing the film's backgrounds. Additionally, Aaron Guzikowksi (Prisoners, Raised by Wolves) will write the scenario script.This isn't the only Death Stranding film we're getting. We also got new information today about the upcoming A24 Death Stranding movie. And Kojima showed off a new clip of upcoming game OD as well.
