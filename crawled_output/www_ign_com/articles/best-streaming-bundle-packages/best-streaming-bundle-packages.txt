(Only now every "channel" requires its own login and password, and costs at least $7 a month.) As the streaming service war wages on with constant changes, mergers and acquisitions, "bundles" are becoming more common as more streaming services are created, and some of these have gotten creative with including both digital and physical services. The ability to combine multiple networks and major streaming platforms into a single subscription is becoming simpler than ever (thankfully) and gives better savings over subscribing individually to every service you'd want. Depending on your needs as a subscriber and your interests as a streamer and/or online shopper, the options available should tick many of your boxes.Check out our picks below for the best streaming bundles to consider subscribing to in 2025 to help you save on your streaming bill.Disney+, Hulu, and HBO Max Bundle – $16.99/month (with ads)Includes adsDisney+, Hulu, HBO Max Bundle89Includes subscriptions to all three services with ads.See itThe Disney+, Hulu, and HBO Max bundle is by far the overall best bundle to subscribe to with pricing starting at $16.99/month for an ad-supported tier. (Going ad-free on all three platforms will bump up the price to $29.99/month.) Since the Hulu and Disney+ price increases arrived back in October, this bundle is overall the best deal in streaming. With access to Disney+, viewers can stream all the Disney classics as well as new Disney properties and releases, such as Marvel TV shows and movies (Deadpool & Wolverine, Daredevil: Born Again), Pixar movies, and everything in the Star Wars universe (Including the last season of Andor). This bundle also include Hulu, which is home to hit original series (The Bear, Shōgun) and documentaries (Minding the Gap, Flee, Enemies of the State), plus its library of movies and licensed shows from networks like FX, ABC, and Fox.With the addition of HBO Max, subscribers also get access to that arsenal of HBO shows and Max exclusives (The White Lotus, The Last of Us, Game of Thrones) and movies (which includes Ghibli films and and all things DC). You'll also get access to shows from HGTV and other Discovery channels since the Discovery+ merger a few years back. Though unfortunately this bundle pricing does not allow for streaming HBO Max in 4K.If a sports-focused package is more your thing, try the Hulu, Disney+, and ESPN+ trio basic bundle for $16.99/month (with ad-free premium bundle at $26.99/month), which includes access to live sports, even UFC fights. This is a great way to get access to the college football playoffs as well. Do you currently have the Disney+, Hulu, and Max BundleYes!No, I don't need thatNo, but I plan on getting it before the price increasesAnswerSee ResultsXfinity Streamsaver – $15/monthXfinity Streamsaver9See it at XfinityFor those that are already Xfinity internet and/or Xfinity TV subscribers, Xfinity StreamSaver is a fantastic way to make the most of your internet and TV bill with an exclusive bundle option.

Though it's worth noting that you will not get Netflix in 4K with the standard with ads plan.Walmart+ with Paramount+ - $12.95/monthWalmart+ 30-Day Free Trial19See it at WalmartOne of the newer, more resourceful subscription bundles, a subscription to Walmart+ automatically grants the customer free access to the Paramount+ digital streaming library. Paramount+ is home to popular franchises like the Star Trek Universe and Sonic the Hedgehog as well as Showtime originals (Yellowjackets). It's also where you can stream all of the Mission Impossible movies, including the Final Reckoning when it comes out.Similar to Amazon Prime Video, Walmart+ has bundled a digital streaming service with a shopping option that mixes digital and physical in a creative way. With a standard Walmart+ membership, users have access to multiple shopping benefits such as: free delivery on almost all items, no order minimums, fuel savings, auto care, exclusive early access to sales events, and free item returns from home.

Ad-SupportedDisney+, Hulu, and ESPN Unlimited Bundle20$35.99 save 17%$29.99 at Disney+ESPN Unlimited has now appeared on the scene, and Disney+ was quick to launch a bundle to accompany it.

With ESPN Unlimited, you'll get access to all of ESPN's linear networks, which host the likes of the NFL, NBA, and more.
