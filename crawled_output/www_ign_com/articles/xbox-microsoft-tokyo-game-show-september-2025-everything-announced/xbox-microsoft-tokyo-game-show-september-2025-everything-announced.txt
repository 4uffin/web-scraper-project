We also got a look at Call of Duty: Black Ops 7's Japanese maps, Gemma Chan as Dr. Selina Tan in 007: First Light, high-level gameplay from Ninja Gaiden 4, and even Bruce Lee joining Hitman: World of Assassination as 47's partner.There were a ton of big announcements during the show, and you can find all of the biggest ones below in one place. After you check it out, let us know what your favorite part was and what you wish had shown up! Forza Horizon 6 Speeds to Japan in 2026Xbox's Tokyo Game Show ended with our first look at Forza Horizon 6, which is actually located in Japan and will be released in 2026. While we didn't get to see actual cars in the open world, we were given a glimpse of a beautiful vista featuring Mount Fuji after a few fun nods to the series' past.“For a long time, Japan has been top of Horizon fans’ wish lists, so we’re excited to finally be bringing this much-requested location to players in Forza Horizon 6,” explains art director Don Arceta to Xbox Wire. “Japan has such a unique culture – from cars, to music, to fashion – that make it perfect for the next Horizon setting. As with any Horizon title, we want to make sure we do the country justice in terms of authentic representation and Horizon open world playability – and now is the right time to realize that fully for players.”The team also shared that the technical side of the equation is now in the right place to bring this vision to life, and they even gave the example of Forza Horizon 5's Hot Wheels DLC, which helped the team develop the elevated roads of Tokyo City.As for where else Forza Horizon 6 will take us, the team isn't quite ready to share any more locations. However, they did give us a small tease.“While we’re not announcing too much in terms of detail right now, we’re excited to show fans the true breadth of beauty – both natural and urban environments – that Japan has to offer,” explains Arceta. “From the neon lights and towering buildings of Tokyo City – one of our most detailed and layered environments to date – to the serenity and natural beauty of Japan’s rural and mountain areas, we think players will be blown away by the open world of Japan that we have built."Japan also has a long and storied history with cars, and Playground Games is doing all it can to honor that."In Japanese car culture, the depth and diversity is astonishing,” Cultural consultant Kyoko Yamashita said. “Kei cars and vans with cult followings, precision motorsport, drifting’s roots, and their passion for customization really stands out. It’s welcoming to different levels of enthusiasm and knowledge, which is exactly the kind of layered world I want players to feel.”And of course Forza Horizon 6 will have changing seasons, which will all pay homage to Japan's "sweltering summers, snowy winters and, of course, the iconic Sakura season, those precious weeks where cherry blossoms bloom across the country."“The team has also been able to build a system where seasonal changes truly inform the world – how spring, summer, autumn, and winter subtly shift tone, activity, and sound,” explains Yamashita. “The team is also really proud of the attention to everyday details: ambient audio like station chimes or summer wind bells that instantly place you without a caption. Those are quiet choices, but they carry a lot of truth.”Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Showcases Multiplayer Maps Set in JapanCall of Duty: Black Ops 7 will feature two maps set in Japan and they were both showcased during Xbox's TGS stream. Toshin was first up and it looks to be set in 2035 Tokyo.

This map is set in the countryside outside Tokyo and "centers around a Japanese castle that's been repurposed as a Guild base."Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 will be released on November 14, and the Early Access Beta will start on October 2 before the Open Beta kicks off on October 5.007: First Light Casts Eternals' Gemma Chan as Dr. Selina Tan007: First Light not only was featured during the stream with quick looks at gameplay, but we were also introduced to MI6's Head of Tactical Simulation, Gemma Chan's Dr. Selina Tan.
