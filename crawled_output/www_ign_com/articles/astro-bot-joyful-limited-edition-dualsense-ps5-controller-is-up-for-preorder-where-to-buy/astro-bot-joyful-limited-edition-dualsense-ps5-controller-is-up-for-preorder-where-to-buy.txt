It sold out quickly, before many fans of the Game of the Year winner could get their hands on one. Sony has heard the fans and is set to release a similar item, called the Astro Bot Joyful Limited Edition DualSense PS5 Controller, on October 30. Preorders are live now at all the usual retailers (see it at Walmart) for $84.99. I’d grab it if you want it, because if it’s like the last iteration, it may not be available for long.Astro Bot Joyful Limited Edition DualSense PS5 ControllerOut October 30Astro Bot Joyful Limited Edition DualSense PS5 Controller1$84.99 at AmazonGet it at AmazonGet it at Best BuyGet it at GameStopGet it at PS DirectGet it at TargetGet it at WalmartThis new version is nearly the same as the previous one, but as indicated by the word “joyful” in its name, the shape of the eyes on the touchpad indicate the bot is smiling this time around. It’s worth noting that, despite how it’s shown in the trailer, the eyes do not animate. They’re just printed on the touchpad in a joyful state.Other New Astro Bot ItemsOut December 115TB Seagate External Game Drive - Astro Bot Limited Edition1$159.99 at PS DirectOut February 27Astro Bot DualSense Wireless Controller Case & Red Panda Plushie1$56.99 at PS DirectIn addition to the controller, Sony is releasing an Astro Bot-themed 5TB external hard drive, as well as a carrying case for the controller that comes with a red panda plushie.

Astro Bot DualSense Controller SpecsPrice: $84.99Preorders Live: September 12, 2025 at 10 a.m. local timeRelease Date: October 30, 2025 Astro Bot is one of my personal favorite PS5 games. It’s a super charming platformer that has you exploring a colorful world with pitch-perfect controls. Each level introduces a new ability or environmental element and makes excellent use of it. There are plenty of collectibles throughout, including bots based on characters from the entire history of PlayStation. It’s a lovely game.Astro Bot (PS5)1$59.99 at PS DirecctAnd this is a lovely looking controller. But it’s worth repeating: if you want to get your hands on one of these and it’s available for preorder, you’d do well to lock in your preorder. There’s no telling how long stock will last.Chris Reed is a commerce editor and deals expert for IGN. He also runs IGN's board game and LEGO coverage.
