With Grand Theft Auto 6 on the horizon, Rockstar‚Äôs continued interest in the RP community has fans hoping for nopixel servers on console versions of past and future GTA games.We‚Äôre excited to support the nopixel team as they create the future of GTA RP. https://t.co/pyb9SzfrfZ‚Äî Rockstar Games (@RockstarGames) September 23, 2025 Nopixel 1.0 launched in 2016, three years after GTA 5‚Äôs original release date, as a PC server where players can immerse themselves within the world of Los Santos by roleplaying as everything from taxi drivers and EMS to police officers. Various updates have arrived for the massively popular roleplay offshoot in the years since, but nopixel V marks the team‚Äôs first official collaboration with Rockstar.It‚Äôs not quite clear what exactly nopixel V is. The announcement itself promises to bring its updated take on GTA 5 RP to the Rockstar Games Launcher and other PC platforms ‚Äúsoon,‚Äù pointing fans to its website for more news and to sign up for invitations.A roster of content creators confirmed to be involved in nopixel V is also available on its website and includes names like Valkyrae and Pokimane. More names will be unveiled in the near future, with the next announcement tied to a countdown that ends in one week. While there's still much about nopixel V to be revealed, official presence on the Rockstar Games Launcher and other PC platforms is still a significant change.Meanwhile, those eager to play GTA 6 had begun speculating about what Rockstar RP servers would look like when the company announced it was working with the FiveM and RedM team at Cfx.re back in 2023. That excitement then only increased when popular musician Faheem Rashad Najm a.k.a. T-Pain teased in 2024 that he was working on GTA 6 but had been asked by Rockstar to stop engaging with RP servers like nopixel.‚ÄúI used to be on nopixel, then I started working on GTA 6, and they told me I couldn't do RP anymore because it kind of goes against... they had this whole speech, like, 'What if somebody took your album and re-recorded it, and more people were listening to that,' and I'm like, 'Okay, I kind of get that, but I was having a good time. Alright that's fine,'" T-Pain said at the time.Now, with Rockstar doubling down on its support for fan-driven RP servers, some believe it‚Äôs only a matter of time before the company announces roleplay support in GTA 5 on consoles, or even for GTA 6. However, Rockstar has yet to announce plans for this kind of support.GTA 6 should have roleplay on Consoles üëÄ‚Äî Synth Potatoü•î (@SynthPotato) September 23, 2025 it's for GTA 6 too but i can't prove it pic.twitter.com/07k8ETC7HU‚Äî _Seven_üçÄüåäüêäüêâ (@Seven97490) September 23, 2025 We‚Äôll know more about Rockstar‚Äôs GTA RP plans when more information about nopixel V is revealed.
