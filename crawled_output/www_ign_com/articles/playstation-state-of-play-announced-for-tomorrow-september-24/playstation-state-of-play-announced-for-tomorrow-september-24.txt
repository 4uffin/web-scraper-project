Surely, we'll see more of that then.Today's announcement by Sony promises a five-minute look at Saros, the new game from Returnal studio Housemarque. But what else should we expect? Notably, Sony said the State of Play will feature updates on big games from third-party publishers (could we get another glimpse at Resident Evil: Requiem?) as well as its own first-party line-up. It definitely feels like we're due another glimpse at Marvel's Wolverine, which has kept a decidedly low profile since Spider-Man developer Insomniac revealed it was working on the project back in September 2021. Since then, clues as to its progress have only filtered out via unofficial means, such as Insomniac's high-profile 2023 hack, and a report which revealed that creative director Brian Horton had departed the project last year to work on Xbox's now-canceled Perfect Dark.PlayStation fans would also surely love an update on Naughty Dog’s Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet. After all, creative director Neil Druckmann is now back on the game full time, following his sojurn on The Last of Us' TV series.As ever, IGN will be covering all of the announcements live, as they happen — join us then!Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
