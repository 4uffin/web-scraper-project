In a CoreXY printer, only the print head moves while the motors are permanently fixed. Since the motors are generally the heaviest component, this improves print speed and precision. The X1C is full assembled and factory calibrated, which means you can set it up and print your first piece in minutes. The chamber is fully enclosed, which allows for a more controlled environment (and thus a more consistent product) compared to an open chamber. It boasts an acceleration speed of up to 20,000 mm/s² and can print a benchy in about 16 minute and 30 seconds. A camera monitors the printing process and records timelapse photos. Other features include dual auto bed leveling, spaghetti failure detection, vibration compensation, and AI inspected first layer.The X1C Combo includes the AMS module. The Automatic Material System (AMS) manages up to 16 different filament spools so you can change materials or colors on the fly. It normally retails for $350, so it's best to get it in this bundle especially if you plan on getting it anyway in the long run.Need more options?
