Amazon also has the Superman 5 Film Collection, and it’s discounted it by more than 50%. Superman 5 Movie Collection1$134.99 save 53%$63.74 at AmazonThis Superman Collection Is Better Than Half Price At AmazonAccording to data from CamelCamelCamel, this marks the lowest discount yet on this particular box set, which comes with awesome cover art of Superman in the Fortress of Solitude.The set includes Superman The Movie, Superman II, Superman II’s Richard Donner Cut, Superman III, and Superman IV, all in 4K versions as well as Blu-Ray and digital downloads.While looking into this set, I hadn’t heard about the Donner cut, which came about after the director was removed from the project by Alexander Salkind, who purchased the film rights to Superman.It was released in 2006, and makes for a more dramatic version of the 1980 movie by sanding down some of the comedic touches from Richard Lester’s version. Now, where have we heard about DC fans campaigning for a different cut of a movie before? Still, at least both versions are included here so you can make your own mind up about which one you prefer.Batman 4K Film Collection (4K Ultra HD + Blu-ray) [4K UHD]5$89.99 save 63%$32.99 at AmazonBatman: The Complete Animated Series (1992) (Blu-ray)2$79.99 save 64%$28.99 at Amazon(Used)The Dark Knight Trilogy: Ultimate Collector's Edition (BD +Digital HD UltraViolet) [Blu-ray]0$34.99 save 29%$25.00 at AmazonBatman, The (4K Ultra HD + Blu-ray)0$33.99 save 63%$12.49 at AmazonThe Dark Knight (4K Ultra HD) [4K UHD]3$34.98 save 64%$12.49 at AmazonBatman & Robin (1997) (4K Ultra HD + Blu-ray + Digital) [4K UHD]0$24.98 save 54%$11.49 at AmazonBatman Forever (4K Ultra HD + Blu-ray + Digital) [4K UHD]1$24.98 save 50%$12.39 at AmazonBatman: Hush (4K Ultra HD + Blu-ray)0$24.98 save 52%$11.99 at AmazonThe Dark Knight Rises (4K Ultra HD)1$34.98 save 64%$12.49 at AmazonLooking for more superhero movie deals?
