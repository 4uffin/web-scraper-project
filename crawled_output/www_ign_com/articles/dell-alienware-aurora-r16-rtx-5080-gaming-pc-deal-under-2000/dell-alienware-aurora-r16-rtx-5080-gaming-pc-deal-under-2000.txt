If you're still rocking an RTX 30 series GPU or older, now would be a good time to upgrade. For example, Dell is offering an Alienware Aurora R16 gaming PC equipped with a powerful GeForce RTX 5080 GPU for just $1,999.99 with free delivery. Such a system would have cost closer to $3,000 earlier this year.Alienware Aurora RTX 5080 Gaming PC From $1,999.99Alienware Aurora R16 Intel Core Ultra 7 265F RTX 5080 Gaming PC (16GB/1TB)51$2,499.99 save 20%$1,999.99 at AlienwareAlienware Aurora R16 Intel Core Ultra 9 285K RTX 5080 Gaming PC (32GB/2TB)8$3,199.99 save 16%$2,699.99 at AlienwareThis system is equipped with an Intel Core Ultra 7 265F CPU, GeForce RTX 5080 GPU, 16GB of DDR5-5600MHz RAM, and a 1TB M.2 SSD. This is a customizable system, so you can upgrade the CPU, RAM, and storage. The processor is air-cooled, however I recommend you upgrade to a 240mm AIO liquid cooling system for just $20.
The entire system is powered by a generous 1,000W 80Plus Platinum power supply.The Core Ultra 7 265F is part of Intel's newest Arrow Lake-S lineup released earlier this year and boasts a max turbo frequency of 5.3GHz with 20 cores and a 36MB L2 cache. This is a good all-around CPU for gaming, multi-tasking, and general workstation performance. For gaming, you won't see much of an improvement upgrading to a Core Ultra 9, especially if you plan to play at high resolutions where the GPU makes much more of an impact. However for multi-tasking and workstation and creator tasks, the Core Ultra 9 is superior because it has significantly more cores.I also added in a link to a more powerful preconfigured system with a liquid-cooled Intel Core Ultra 9 285K processor and double the SSD storage for $2,699.99.The GeForce RTX 5080 GPU will run any game in 4KPerformance-wise, the RTX 5080 is no slouch. It's one of the fastest cards on the market, bested only by the $2,000 RTX 5090 and the discontinued $1,600 RTX 4090. This is a phenomenal card for playing the latest, most demanding games in 4K resolution at high settings and ray tracing enabled. The RTX 5080 supports DLSS 4 with multi-frame generation, which means you can push even more frames out of games that support the technology with minimal visual compromise. Recent games that support it include Doom: The Dark Ages, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 (after a recent update), Wuchang: Fallen Feathers, Stellar Blade, and upcoming titles like Borderlands 4 and Battlefield 6.Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 FE Review by Jacqueline Thomas"If you already have a high-end graphics card from the last couple of years, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 doesn’t make a lot of sense – it just doesn’t have much of a performance lead over the RTX 4080, though the extra frames from DLSS 4 Multi-Frame Generation do make things look better in games that support it. However, for gamers with an older graphics card who want a significant performance boost, the RTX 5080 absolutely provides – doubly so if you’re comfortable with Nvidia’s AI goodies."Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.
