Right now the Logitech G923 Trueforce Racing Wheel and Pedal Set is down to $299.99 after a $100 off instant discount. Apply coupon code "F-SHIFT" to drop the price to $229.99 and a free Driving Force Shifter is automatically added to cart. Finally, there's an option to add a free pair of Trueforce Racing Gloves. This is far and away the best deal I've seen for this racing wheel and I highly doubt we'll find a better deal for the rest of the year. There are all brand new, ship for free, and you're buying it directly from Logitech so you're eligible for the excellent 2 year warranty.Update: There was a second code that dropped the price by another $15, but that code now can't be used with "F-SHIFT". However, this is still an outstanding deal that includes two freebies on top of a hefty discount.Logitech G923 Trueforce Racing Wheel Set for $229.99Includes free Driving Force Shifter and Trueforce Racing GlovesLogitech G923 Trueforce Racing Wheel Set with Free Driving Force Shifter and Trueforce Racing Gloves4$399.99 save 43%$229.99 at LogitechUse code 'F-SHIFT'To get the discounts and freebies, follow these directionsAdd the Logitech G923 racing wheel (either PS5 or Xbox) to your cartAt cart, apply coupon code "F-SHIFT"Price will drop to $229.99 and shifter will be automatically addedClick on "Add Free Gift"Racing gloves should be automatically addedCheck out and enjoy your huge savingsThe G923 is Logitech's mainstream racing wheel that replaces the venerable G920/G29 racing wheels. It's compatible with the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and PC platforms. New to the G923 is TrueForce technology, which can deciper the physics and audio of supported racing games and convert them to extra sensations and vibrations to the wheel rim and into your hands. The force feedback does a bang up job of making the driving experience feel real and immersive; if you want something better than this, you'd have to shell out a lot more money for a direct-drive or belt-driven wheel, like Logitech's own $1,000 G Pro direct-drive racing wheel we reviewed.Other than that, it's pretty similar to the G29 (PlayStation) racing wheel. It features a hand-stitched leather racing wheel with 900 degrees of rotation, sturdy metal base, durable steel ball bearings in the shaft, gear-driven dual-force motor feedback, stainless shifter and pressure sensitive pedals. The Driving
Force Shifter pairs seamlessly with your G923 wheel and pedals. It features a solid steel gear shaft, 6-speed short-throw gearbox, and leather knob and boot. If you're a big fan of racing games like Gran Turismo 7 or Forza Horizon 5 and you've been using a DualSense controller or gamepad this entire time, then this price drop might be the excuse for you to step up your immersion to the next level.Why Should You Trust IGN's Deals Team?IGN's deals team has a combined 30+ years of experience finding the best discounts in gaming, tech, and just about every other category.
