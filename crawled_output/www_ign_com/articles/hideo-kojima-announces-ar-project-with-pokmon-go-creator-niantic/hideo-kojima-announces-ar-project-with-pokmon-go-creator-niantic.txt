Niantic Spatial is the new name for Pokémon Go creator Niantic, following its recent refocus solely around AR applications and the sale of the bulk of its gaming portfolio — Pokémon Go, Monster Hunter Now and Pikmin Bloom — to Monoply Go maker Scopely.Doubling down on its real-world augmented reality gameplay, Niantic Spatial will offer its technology to Kojima Productions for a fresh project glimpsed in concept form today. "In the near future, move beyond the screen," a flashy teaser suggested. At one point, a man in AR glasses scans a digital model that has appeared on top of a real-world object using his phone — something that's very Pokémon Go.KOJIMA PRODUCTIONS 10th Anniversary Event“Beyond The Strand” – Breaking NewsAnnouncing a strategic partnership with Niantic Spatialhttps://t.co/fVjcbr8SsL#KojimaProductions #KJP10th #NianticSpatial #GeospatialAI pic.twitter.com/4KvVmZO0Bb— KOJIMA PRODUCTIONS (Eng) (@KojiPro2015_EN) September 23, 2025 "I can't really speak about details yet but, if you're climbing a mountain... there's still entertainment there," Kojima teased. "It's like the real Death Stranding in the real world, and you can connect with people, or you can connect with the actual environment there in your city. Previously it was like virtual reality, but this time I'm thinking about connecting with the real environment.""I hope that it creates [an environment] that brings people together to play," said Niantic Spatial boss John Hanke. "If there's one thing need we have in our society right now, it's something that unifies us and doesn't pull us apart. And I think that storytelling... has always been humanity's way of coming together. And technology can support that. It can divide it too, but with an inspiring creator it can be an important force in the world."In a subsequent press release shared with IGN, Niantic Spatial said the collaboration marked a "significant moment for both companies and a shared vision to push the boundaries of what's possible in interactive storytelling."There was no word on when Kojima and Niantic Spatial's project would launch.This morning we also heard more from Kojima on the Death Stranding movie and animated spin-off, saw a first trailer for Xbox Game Studios title OD, and got a glimpse at artwork and casting details for Physint.
