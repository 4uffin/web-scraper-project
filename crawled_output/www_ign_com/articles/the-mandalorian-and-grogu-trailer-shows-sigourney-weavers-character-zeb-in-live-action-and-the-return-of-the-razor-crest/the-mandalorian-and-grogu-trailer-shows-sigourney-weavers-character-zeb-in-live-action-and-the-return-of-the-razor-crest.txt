How can the Razor Crest, Mando's ship from The Mandalorian Disney+ series, return in The Mandalorian and Grogu after it was destroyed by a single shot from Moff Gideon's light cruiser during a skirmish on the planet Tython? Perhaps Mando had solid enough spaceship insurance that he had it replaced it with a brand new one.More: Star Wars: What the Heck Is the Plot of The Mandalorian and Grogu?Mando and Grogu scope out an Imperial base of some sort. The diminuitive Grogu infiltrates alongside the even more diminuitive Babu Frik, who made his debut in The Rise of Skywalker. We then see Mando and Grogu sit down for a chat with Sigourney Weaver’s character (the ever hungry Grogu uses the Force to try to nab some snacks, but Sigourney isn't having any of it).Every Upcoming Star Wars Movie and TV ShowView 21 ImagesWe then skip to a fight scene in which Mando kicks someone's butt. There are monsters in the classic practical effects Star Wars style, a spaceship dogfight, Grogu swimming, and a 'glimpse and you'll miss it' look at Zeb in live-action.Garazeb "Zeb" Orrelios is the muscle of the Ghost team, a Lasat honor guard who adopted the cause of the Rebellion against the Empire in much loved animated series Star Wars Rebels. He made his live-action debut in a brief scene in The Mandalorian. Here we see him beat up stormtroopers, who fans will remember he nicknamed “bucket heads.”Based on the trailer, it looks like Grogu teams up with more from Babu Frik's Anzellan species for some sort of mission. We see what looks like a gladatorial arena, in which a muscular Rotta the Hutt appears. Mando kicks more robot butt and takes on a horrible monster in what looks like the same arena from before. And then the big finish: Mando and Grogu shoot out of an AT-AT as it explodes and falls to its doom.The trailer ends with Grogu shooting a monster in its eye with a green sludge. "Good shot, baby!" declares Babu Frik.Here's the official blurb on Star Wars: The Mandalorian and Grogu:The evil Empire has fallen, and Imperial warlords remain scattered throughout the galaxy. As the fledgling New Republic works to protect everything the Rebellion fought for, they have enlisted the help of legendary Mandalorian bounty hunter Din Djarin (Pedro Pascal) and his young apprentice Grogu. Directed by Jon Favreau, Star Wars: The Mandalorian and Grogu also stars Sigourney Weaver and is produced by Jon Favreau, Kathleen Kennedy, Dave Filoni, and Ian Bryce, with music composed by Ludwig Göransson.The Jon Favreau-directed The Mandalorian and Grogu, due to hit theaters May 22, 2026, is the first theatrical Star Wars movie since 2019's critically panned Rise of Skywalker. While Lucasfilm has announced a number of new Star Wars movies in the years since, The Mandalorian and Grogu arrives six-and-a-half years after Rise of Skywalker. Star Wars: Starfighter, starring Ryan Gosling, is due out a year later, in May 2027.Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.
