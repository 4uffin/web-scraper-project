You can watch the trailer via the player above or the embed below.Like the other entries in the series, The Conjuring: Last Rites draws its inspiration from the case files of real-life paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren, who are once again portrayed by Patrick Wlson and Vera Farmiga.Last Rites is based on the demonic haunting of Jack and Janet Smurl’s home in West Pittston, Pennsylvania, which lasted from 1974 to 1989. The new trailer reveals that the demon haunting the Smurls is the first one that Ed and Lorraine Warren ever encountered but they were young and fled. Now, the Warrens must finally confront the evil that they were too afraid to face all those years before.Joining Wilson and Farmiga in the cast are Mia Tomlinson as Ed and Lorraine's now adult daughter Judy, who plays a more prominent role in the proceedings. Ben Hardy portrays her future husband, Tony Spera.The trailer also reveals quick glimpses of the iconic demon doll Annabelle, the villain that started the whole franchise off back in 2013’s The Conjuring, directed by James Wan.The Conjuring Movies in (Chronological) OrderView 9 ImagesFor more on The Conjuring: Last Rites, be sure to check out our exclusive interview with director Michael Chaves about the end (and future) of the Conjuring franchise.The Conjuring: Last Rites opens in theaters on September 5, 2025.In This ArticleThe Conjuring: Last RitesWarner Bros.
