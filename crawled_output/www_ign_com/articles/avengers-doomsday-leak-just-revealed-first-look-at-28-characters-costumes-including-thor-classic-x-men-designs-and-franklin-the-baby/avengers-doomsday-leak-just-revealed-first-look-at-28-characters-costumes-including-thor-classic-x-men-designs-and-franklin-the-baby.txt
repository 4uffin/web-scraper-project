A fresh leak from an Avengers: Doomsday production member has given fans their first look at dozens of characters' costumes ‚Äî including classic X-Men designs, and our first peek at the youngest member of the new Avengers team.The surprise look at a swathe of the Avengers: Doomsday cast comes from a production gift given out to staff who worked on the movie. Specifically, production members were given a bag emblazoned with illustrations of 28 Doomsday characters, including a member of the OG Avengers, The Fantastic Four, New Avengers, and more.Notably, this is our first look at the likely-final designs for Fox's X-Men, as well as updated costumes for a host of returning MCU favorites. The image was snapped and uploaded to Instagram by Avengers: Doomsday makeup artist Gionvanna Ponci, ComicBook reported. At the time of writing, Ponci's account has now been made private.AVENGERS: DOOMSDAY promo art featuring first look at the X-Men's costumes üëÄ pic.twitter.com/ESHQaoSXLt‚Äî Ben Geskin (@BenGeskin) September 21, 2025 From left to right, the image's first column begins with the man himself, Doctor Doom, played of course by MCU veteran Robert Downey Jr. Fans are in agreement that the costume seen here matches the one spotted at a Disney marketing expo in China earlier this month.Next is our first look at Thor, once again played by Chris Hemsworth, who sports a Ragnarok-style short hair cut with gold pauldrons. (I guess we're all just pretending Thor: Love and Thunder didn't exist, and fair enough.) Antony Mackie's Captain America and Paul Rudd's Ant-Man are next, with costumes that look relatively familiar.The Fantastic Four (Pedro Pascal's Reed Richards, Vanessa Kirby's Sue Storm, Ebon Moss-Bachrach's The Thing and Joseph Quinn's Johnny Storm) sit in the second column, now sporting new jackets. Space gets cold, I guess, and the team was last seen at the end of Thunderbolts*/The New Avengers travelling into our universe ‚Äî presumably in search of baby Franklin Richards, last seen sat on the lap of Doctor Doom.The third column features Sebastian Stan's Bucky, Letitia Wright's Shuri (who is also now Black Panther), Simu Liu's Xu Shang-Chi and Tom Hiddleston's Loki ‚Äî last seen becoming the master of the multiverse itself.Column four includes the first two figures from the Thunderbolts, now re-named The New Avengers. Florence Pugh's Yelena is partially covered by the bag's label, but is easy enough to make out. Next up is David Harbour's Red Guardian. Below him is a regal-looking M'Baku, played by Winston Duke, whose costume has fans wondering if he is now the new king of Wakanda. Below him is Tenoch Huerta's Namor, in a suit with a collar that looks to be inspired by his appearance in Marvel comics. (He's got to look good for Sue, after all.)Next comes the X-Men, beginning with a figure almost fully obscured but who most likely seems to be Ian McKellen's Magneto, dressed in familiar red robes. Sat below him are Patrick Stewart's Charles Xavier, no longer in the yellow floating wheelchair from Multiverse of Madness, Channing Tatum's Gambit, who wears a similar costume to his appearance in Deadpool & Wolverine, and Rebecca Romjin's Mystique, who gets to wear clothes for a change. The Most Surprising Avengers and Marvel Characters Not Announced for DoomsdayView 12 ImagesThe penultimate column includes more X-Men, such as Kelsey Grammer's very blue-looking Beast, plus a comics-accurate looks for James Marsden's Cyclops and Alan Cummings' Nightcrawler. Leading into another dollop of New Avengers is Wyatt Russell's John Walker. Finally, comes Hannah John-Kamen's Ghost, Danny Ramirez's Falcon and Lewis Pullman's Sentry, who's clearly over the problems he was having turning back into his super-powered self. Rounding out the list is the only actor whose identity we don't know ‚Äî a young child now portraying Franklin Richards, the son of Reed and Sue.As well as dicussing who is included, fans are also debating which characters are not part of the above line-up. There's no one here who wasn't part of Marvel's big chair reveal ‚Äî and it may be that this is deliberate, to limit the impact of leaks such as this. But fans are certainly expecting more characters to be a part of Doomsday, including Teyonah Parris and Lashana Lynch as Maria and Monica Rambeau, last seen in the X-Men universe. There's no sign above of Mark Ruffalo's Hulk, who's reportedly also set to appear in Spider-Man: Brand New Day. There's also no sign of fellow past Avengers such as Benedict Cumberbatch's Doctor Strange and Brie Larson's Captain Marvel, either. Do You Think Chris Evans Is in Avengers: Doomsday?Yes!No!Sort of (tell us why and how in the comments)!AnswerSee ResultsIf they're included, Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye and Hailee Steinfeld's Kate Bishop are being kept secret ‚Äî as are all of the other characters typically associated with the Young Avengers (such as Iman Vellani's Ms. Marvel, Kathryn Newton's Cassie Lang and Xochitl Gomez's America Chavez). Recent set reports have suggested Chris Evans and Hayley Atwell have filmed scenes as Steve Rogers and Peggy Carter, meanwhile, though it's perhaps unsurprising these are being kept under wraps.Avengers: Doomsday has now wrapped its principal filming and is set to launch in theaters on December 18, 2026. Could this be it for filming leaks? Probably not. As is the Marvel way, it's expected the movie will undergo further additional photography ‚Äî here's hoping we hear of even more characters' involvement then.Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
