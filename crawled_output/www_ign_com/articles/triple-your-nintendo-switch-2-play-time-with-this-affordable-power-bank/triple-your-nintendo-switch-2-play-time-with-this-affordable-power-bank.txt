If you factor in 80% power efficiency, here are the approximate number of times you can fully recharge some of the more popular gaming handhelds and smartphones:Nintendo Switch (16Whr) about 1.9 timesSteam Deck (40Whr) about 0.74 timesApple iPhone 16 (14Whr) about 2.1 timesApple iPhone 16 Plus (18Whr) about 1.6 timesNintendo Switch 2 (20Whr) about 1.5 times*Apple iPhone 17 has slightly higher battery capacity than iPhone 16Extend your Nintendo Switch 2 playtimeThe Nintendo Switch 2 is now available at multiple retailers and if you don't yet have a power bank, now would be a good time to get one. Nintendo's official statement is that the Switch 2 lasts anywhere between 2 to 6.5 hours of playtime. The Switch 2 has a 5,220mAh battery, which isn't that much bigger than the 4,310mAh battery found in the original Switch. A 10,000mAh power bank will give you more than double the playtime. In addition, the 45W Power Delivery spec means that this power bank will charge the Switch 2 at its fastest rate.The Iniu power bank has three output ports: one built-in 45W USB Type-C cable, one 45W USB Type-C port, and one USB Type-A port. The 45W of Power Delivery is enough to charge the Nintendo Switch (18W) and Steam Deck (40W) at their fastest rate. This power bank is also a good match with the Apple iPhone 16, since ChargerLAB has shown that the maximum charging rate caps at about 30W. The iPhone 17 is expected to have a similar charging rate.The built-in cable is a popular feature on newer power banks because you no longer have to bring along your own USB Type-C cable. In this case both ends of the cable are detachable. This is arguably more useful than a built-in cable where one end is permanently attached to the power bank, because it can be used with other devices.For more options, check out our favorite portable power banks for traveling.How to Follow IGN Deals RecommendationsThe IGN Deals team has over 30 years of combined experience finding the best discounts and preorders available online.
