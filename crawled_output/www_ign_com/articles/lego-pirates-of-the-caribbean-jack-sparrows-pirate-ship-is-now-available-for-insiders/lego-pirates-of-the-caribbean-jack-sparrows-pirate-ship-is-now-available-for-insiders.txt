The only catch is that we’re currently in the “early access” phase of the rollout, so the new set's only available to LEGO Insiders. Thankfully, the Insiders membership program is 100% free to join. You can sign up here right now, and then buy the set. You’ll even get two free Gift With Purchase sets (while supplies last).LEGO Icons Captain Jack Sparrow's Pirate ShipLEGO Icons Captain Jack Sparrow's Pirate Ship14$379.99 at LEGO StoreSet #: 10365Price: $379.99Ages: 18+Pieces: 2,862Dimensions: over 25 in. (64 cm) high, 25 in. (64 cm) long and 9 in. (23 cm) wideThe Gift with Purchase (GWP) sets are pretty cool in their own right. One is Captain Jack Sparrow’s Compass (set #5009609), which would cost $19.99 if it were available separately. It’s only available as a GWP with LEGO Jack Sparrow’s Pirate Ship between now and September 18. The other GWP available right now is this SEGA Genesis Controller, set #40769 (see it at LEGO Store). It’s also valued at $19.99, and is only available until September 17 as a GWP with purchases of $130 or more. So if you want two free sets when you purchase Jack Sparrow’s Pirate Ship, you’ll want to buy it before September 17.As for the ship itself, it’s a big, dark, imposing vessel that stands over two feet tall. Surely you remember it from the Pirates of the Caribbean movies. It comes with eight minifigures: Captain Jack Sparrow, Will Turner, Elizabeth Swann, Hector Barbossa, Gibbs, Cotton, Anamaria, and last but not least, Marty.The set is nicely detailed, with a full captain’s quarters belowdeck, torn sails that are true to the movies, and a detachable rowboat. You can display the ship in full on the buildable stand, or you can remove the bottom of the hull so it looks like it’s submerged in water. Turning the ship’s wheel moves its rudder, just like a real ship, and there are dials you can turn to deploy the ship’s cannons on each side.I’ve seen many instances when GWP sets sell out, and when they’re gone, they’re gone. If you want to make sure you get both sets for free, I’d grab old Jack Sparrow’s Pirate Ship sooner than later.More New LEGO SetsLEGO Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse Minifigures58$4.99 at LEGO StoreLEGO Batman: Arkham Asylum46$299.99 at LEGO StoreLEGO Star Wars Advent Calendar 202523$44.99 at AmazonLEGO Harry Potter Advent Calendar 202524$44.99 at AmazonLEGO Minecraft Advent Calendar 202537$44.99 at AmazonLEGO Disney Frozen Advent Calendar 202510$44.99 at AmazonLEGO City Advent Calendar 20255$34.99 at AmazonLEGO Friends Advent Calendar 20254$34.99 at AmazonLEGO Harry Potter Hogsmeade Village – Collectors' Edition35$399.99 at LEGO StoreLEGO Disney & Pixar Wall-E & EVE72$69.96 at AmazonLEGO Wicked Emerald City & Kiamo Ko Castle5$79.99 at AmazonLEGO Nike Dunk Trickshot31$39.99 at LEGO StoreLEGO Icons Captain Jack Sparrow's Pirate Ship14$379.99 at LEGO StoreLEGO Ideas Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory65$219.99 at LEGO StoreThis is just one of the many LEGO sets releasing in September.
