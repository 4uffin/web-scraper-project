As revealed in the exclusive new trailer below, this elder version of Sam is living as a recluse in rural Eastern Europe when he’s pulled back into the black-ops trade.Netflix hired Derek Kolstad, the creator of John Wick and Nobody, to serve as the series’ showrunner. Although he admits that he played the games and “sucked,” Kolstad is a huge fan of the character of Sam Fisher and of the books by the late author Tom Clancy, who, although he didn’t write any of them, endorsed a series of Splinter Cell tie-in novels.I recently chatted with Derek Kolstad about what convinced him to do the Netflix series. “They let me do Old Man Sam and to actually use everything in the video games and all the ancillaries as his past resume as canon. That one to me was fun,” Kolstad said. This allowed him to craft an original story that nevertheless “respects the games that I loved and the character I just adored.”So is Splinter Cell: Deathwatch, which is set decades after the events of the original games, itself to be considered canon? Kolstad isn’t entirely certain but told IGN, “I hope so. … [Ubisoft’s] got a stranglehold on their IP for good measure because they’ve got some of the best titles. But there were some things that along the way [they] were like, ‘Don't do that.’ And I'm like, ‘Why?’ And they're like, ‘Hey, we got other plans.’ Again, I only get to peer behind part of the curtain for what they're thinking [of for the] long run. But for what I want to do with the anime and talking in the future of any other spinoff they want to do, it's going like, ‘This fits the mold.’”Watch the exclusive new trailer for Splinter Cell: Deathwatch below:An older, once-notorious badass now living a quiet life is a concept Kolstad is quite familiar with, having used it to great effect in his scripts for the original John Wick and 2021’s Nobody. Kolstad acknowledged the parallel to those works but added that he “had the flexibility to go where I wanted to go with (Sam). And it's been done before in Old Mad Logan, but in many respects, this is my Unforgiven. This is the ‘one last job’ from the old '70s thrillers, and it was a joy, man.”Some Splinter Cell fans may be disappointed that Michael Ironside, who voiced Sam Fisher in the games, isn’t reprising the role for Deathwatch, especially since Sam is meant to be older in the show. “I loved him, but ultimately it was like, ‘If we're going to be doing this for a while, they just wanted a new sound.’ And when they were going through the various voices, any number of people were up for the role,” Kolstad said. The showrunner is particularly fond of Liev Schreiber’s performance in the 2002 spy thriller The Sum of All Fears, which is what made him “perfect” to succeed Ironside in the role of Sam Fisher: “Say what you will about that movie, but Liev Schreiber as John Clark was perfect. And so when his name came up, it was looking through that lens of John Clark. It's again, they’re both Clancy characters, they're attached to the hip, same creator, same universe, and it just seemed perfect.” "You have to rip the spine out of the source material. Keep the brain and the heart.“Splinter Cell: Deathwatch revisits some of the events depicted in the 2005 game Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory, with flashbacks recounting the close friendship and later tragic falling-out between Sam and his former comrade-in-arms, Douglas Shetland. “Even though we have elements of that game referenced there, it's hopefully small enough and the changes therein minute enough [that fans won’t be upset],” Kolstad said. “But the other thing you have to look at with an adaptation, especially when it's the first time in this medium, you have to rip the spine out of the source material,” he continued. “Keep the brain and the heart, entertain the soul, and do your best to actually build it into something that works.”Check out this exclusive new poster for Splinter Cell: Deathwatch.In the show’s present day storyline, Shetland’s children – half-siblings Diana and Charlie – now control their late father’s infamous company, Displace International. Diana has retooled Displace into a green energy firm with global ties; Charlie is a ne’er-do-well who yearns for a larger role and to emerge from out of Diana’s shadow. What Displace and the Shetland offspring are really up to drives the larger plot of Splinter Cell: Deathwatch. It’s why Sam gets reactivated as an operative for the clandestine unit Fourth Echelon, coming to the aid of a younger agent, Zinnia McKenna, who has been wounded while on a mission. Along with his old tech support colleague Anna Grimsdottir and her fellow Fourth Echelon members Jo and Thunder, Sam and Zinnia uncover a larger conspiracy involving Displace that threatens Europe.Splinter Cell: Deathwatch ImagesView 17 ImagesWith Sam now ostensibly a retiree, Kolstad’s approach to the character is reflective of his understanding of the psychology of real-life veterans. “You talk to Special Forces and first responders and anyone in this kind of game, you get into your late 30s, you're the old man,” Kolstad explained. “So when you talk about what is the thing with a well-trained soldier, it's tears in training, it's laughing in the field. Because you think in the field you're going to die, it's better than what they did back in training. And I think when (Sam) is actually used as the scalpel he was forged to be, [it pleases him because] we all like feeling useful, man.”Similarly, the Fourth Echelon of Deathwatch is also grappling with being “analog in a digital world,” as Kolstad put it. “I think it's there in the same place that Sam is, where it's like they're about to be mothballed. Or in a digital era, why do we need boots on the ground?” Kolstad said. “Do I have a place in this world? And ultimately they do, because they are the point of the spear. You still need that guy to push the button, and they're the ones to push the button.”You can push the button – the play button, that is – to see Sam Fisher return to his stealthy ways when Splinter Cell: Deathwatch launches on Netflix on October 14.Originally posted: Sep 16, 2025 3:00 pmIn This ArticleSplinter Cell: DeathwatchNetflixOct 14, 2025Where to WatchPowered byNot yet available for streaming.Reviews•Editor Columns•News•Guides•Upcoming Sales Events•How to Watch Guides•Board Game Reviews•GTA 5 Cheats•Best Streaming Bundles•IGN Store•Top Deals•Contact Us•IGN YouTube•HowLongToBeat•IGN TikTok•IGN Twitter•Map Genie•Eurogamer•Rock Paper Shotgun•VG247•Maxroll•Privacy Policy•Terms of Use
