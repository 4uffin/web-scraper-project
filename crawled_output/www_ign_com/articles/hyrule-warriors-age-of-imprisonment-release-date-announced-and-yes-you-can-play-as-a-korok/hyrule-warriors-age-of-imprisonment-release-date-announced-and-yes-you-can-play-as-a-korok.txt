It's there she'll team up with Hyrule's earliest royalty, including King Rauru and Queen Sonia.If you've played Tears of the Kingdom, you'll know a bit of this story already — it's the conflict against Ganondorf that was known as the Imprisoning War. A trailer shown during today's major Nintendo Direct, above, highlighted the game's powerful Sync Strikes mechanic, where two players can team up together to land devastating attacks. Speaking of two players, there's an option for two-player splitscreen co-op if you have a friend to hand. Alternatively, you can play multiplayer via GameShare, allowing a Switch 2 or original Switch owner to join in without owning a copy of the game themselves.You'll be able to play as Zelda, King Rauru and Queen Sonia — and also, brilliantly, as a heroic little Korok fighter. You can also use Zonai devices to great effect, blasting away enemies with wind and water. Today brought a huge amount of news on everything from Mario to Pokémon, Yoshi to Fire Emblem. For much more, check out everything announced at the Nintendo Direct September 2025.
