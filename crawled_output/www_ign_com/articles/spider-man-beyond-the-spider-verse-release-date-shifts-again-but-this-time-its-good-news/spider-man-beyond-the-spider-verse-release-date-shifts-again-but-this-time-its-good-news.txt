So, while we continue the wait, let’s recount what we know about the film.Daniel Kaluuya, who played Hobart "Hobie" Brown / Spider-Punk in 2023’s Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, is set to play the same character in Beyond the Spider-Verse (he’s also reportedly set to reprise the role in a Spider-Punk animated spinoff).Marvin Jones III, who voices supervillain Tombstone in Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, is also set to reprise his role for Beyond the Spider-Verse. (He’ll play a live-action version of the character in next year’s MCU movie Spider-Man: Brand New Day, too.)In April, Sony released the first photos of Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse during its CinemaCon presentation. Check them out in the gallery below.Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse ImagesView 5 ImagesSpider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse is directed by Bob Persichetti and Justin K. Thompson, and produced by Phil Lord, Chris Miller, Amy Pascal and Avi Arad, and Jinko Gotoh. The screenplay is by Phil Lord, Christopher Miller, and David Callaham.Speaking at CinemaCon, the filmmakers said of their delayed film that they needed to make sure they got it just right. Lord said the directors had decided to break the boundaries of animation again, while Persichettii said they would mix more animation styles this time around.Story wise, Lord said Beyond the Spider-Verse picks up right after the events of Across the Spider-Verse, and that Gwen Stacy and Miles Morales’ friends may or may not be enough to save everyone.Footage screened for attendees began with a voiceover from Miles: “You can’t ask me… not to save my father.” The footage then pulled back through trippy sky colors and images from the last movie with dialogue excerpts.Miles was seen fighting his evil self and walking into a dark tunnel with others behind him. Then his line from the last movie – “Imma do my own thing” – was heard before confirmation of what was then a June 4, 2027 release date.The road to release has been a long one. In July, Sony Pictures delayed the release of Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse by three weeks, and now it's shifted again. Assuming it makes its new June 18, 2027 release date, Beyond the Spider-Verse will come out four years after Across the Spider-Verse, and eight-and-a-half years after Into the Spider-Verse. This one’s certainly been hard for Sony to pin down.It’s a busy time for Spider-Man, with Brand New Day and Spider-Noir, a live-action Prime Video series starring Nicolas Cage, both due out next year.Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
