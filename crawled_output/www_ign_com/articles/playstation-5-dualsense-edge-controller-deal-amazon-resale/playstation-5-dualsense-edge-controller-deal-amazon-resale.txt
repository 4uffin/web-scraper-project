The best price I ever found it for brand new was for $169 during the Days of Play Sale back in July. Fortunately, if you don't mind getting a "like new" one instead, there's a way to get it for way less.Amazon Resale (Amazon's official used goods store) has "Like New" DualSense Edge controllers for just $145.73 after a 25% off coupon that's automatically applied during checkout. "Like New" items are usually brand new, often with damage to the packaging but not to the contents themselves. You're still covered by Amazon's excellent 30-day return policy, so it's a safer option than buying something off Facebook marketplace.PS5 DualSense Edge Controller (Used: Like New) for $145Used: Like NewPS5 DualSense Edge Wireless Controller2$199.99 save 27%$145.73 at Amazon ResaleThe DualSense Edge is Sony's high-end controller for the PS5 console. It offers pro-level features like grips, adjustable analog sticks, mappable rear buttons, profiles, and more. You can swap out the standard analog stick tops with convex replacements that come in two different heights. If your analog sticks crap out, you can buy replacements for $19.99. There are also two sets of interchangeable back buttons that can be mapped to any button on the DualSense Edge controller. One of the most important features of any pro controller are the triggers, and they’ve gotten attention in the DualSense Edge as well. Next to each trigger is a stop slider that lets you adjust how far you have to press the trigger down to make it register. You can choose standard, medium, or short travel distances.Accessories include a hard shell case anda 9 foot long USB-C cable. All-in-all, it's a significant upgrade from the standard DualSense controller and, with this deal, worth the price premium.How to Follow IGN Deals RecommendationsThe IGN Deals team has over 30 years of combined experience finding the best discounts and preorders available online.
