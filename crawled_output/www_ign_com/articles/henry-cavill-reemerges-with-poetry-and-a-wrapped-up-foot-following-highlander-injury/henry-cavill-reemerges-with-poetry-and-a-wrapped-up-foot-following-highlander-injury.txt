It was unclear how exactly Cavill was hurt while training for the upcoming Highlander reboot, but judging by his post today, it looks like the injury is located around his left foot and ankle.While Cavill rests his leg next to his dog and, of course, a neat stack of Warhammer books, how he sustained the injury remains unclear. Instead of explaining how the injury came to be, the ex-Superman star used his post as an opportunity to share some poetry. Specifically, the poem he posted in the caption for his 28.3 million Instagram followers is William Ernest Henley’s Invictus.Cavill will be off his feet for quite a while longer, so don’t expect any Highlander updates anytime soon. THR reported last week that the Chad Stahelski-directed film was on track to go into production “in the coming weeks.” That has been pushed back, with production now expected to begin in early 2026.There is still much we have yet to learn about how Highlander will bring the cult-classic story to modern audiences. However, in June, we did learn that Russell Crowe is set to reunite with his Man of Steel co-star for the project, with Karen Gillan, Dave Bautista, Marisa Abela, Djimon Hounsou, and Max Zhang all also attached. Stahelski has also teased that more Highlander could be in the cards.“I’ll say it for you first, our story engages a lot of the same characters and stuff like that,” the John Wick director told Happy Sad Confused in 2023. “But we’ve also brought in elements of all the TV shows, and we’re trying to do a bit of a prequel, a setup to The Gathering, so we have room to grow the property.”While Cavill rests, you can check out how his Warhammer studying might be helping him tackle the challenge of creating the Warhammer 40,000 cinematic universe. You can also check out what appears to be the star’s long-lost audition to play 007.Photo by Daniele Venturelli/Getty Images.Michael Cripe is a freelance writer with IGN.
