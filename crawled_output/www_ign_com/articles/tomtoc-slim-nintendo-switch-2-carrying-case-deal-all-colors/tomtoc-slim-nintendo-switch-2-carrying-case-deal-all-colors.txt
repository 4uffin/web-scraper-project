Its signature trademark is the raised indent patterning for each handheld's unique analog joystick and button layout. This is mostly an aesthetic touch, but it helps set Tomtoc cases apart from the boring monochrome design you'll see for nearly every other case out there including the official case.Material-wise, the Tomtoc is a hardshell case with a felt inner lining. It has an interior flap that can fit up to 12 game cards, a buckle strap, and durable YKK zipper that's smoother and easier to use than the Genki Sleeper case. Since this is a slim case designed for as minimal of a footprint as possible, there's no room to fit a charger.Tomtoc Slim Case Review by Jesse Vitelli"The Tomtoc FancyCase-G05 has a slim profile that’s perfect for those who travel a lot and don't want a bulky case taking up precious space in their personal item or carry-on. Its smart design makes taking it out a breeze, and the protective inner and outer shell ensure that you never have to worry about your Switch 2 while it’s in the case. And you can keep a dozen Switch game carts in it as well. It retails for $36.99 and I would absolutely recommend it for the price."Need something bigger?tomtoc Gaming Handheld Sling Bag (Switch 2 Compatible)4$59.99 save 25%$44.99 at AmazonIf you're looking for something roomier, Tomtoc also has a sling-style case that's specifically made for portable gaming handhelds including the Switch 2. The padded compartment is shaped like a "W" to make room for a wide range of handhelds that have dual analog joysticks. It's not specifically designed for the Switch 2, so don't expect a molded fit, but there's plenty of room here to fit extra controllers, a charger or power bank, and more.Stock up on more essential Switch 2 accessoriesNintendo Switch 2 orders have shipped and many lucky gamers are playing Mario Kart World as I write this. In addition to a new case, you might want to think about picking up some other Switch 2 accessories, like a MicroSD Express card for extra storage, a screen protector for extra protection, or a power bank for extra battery life. Check out the list of officially licensed Switch 2 accessories that are already up for preorder, including the all-new Switch 2 Pro controller.Why Should You Trust IGN's Deals Team?IGN's deals team has a combined 30+ years of experience finding the best discounts in gaming, tech, and just about every other category.
