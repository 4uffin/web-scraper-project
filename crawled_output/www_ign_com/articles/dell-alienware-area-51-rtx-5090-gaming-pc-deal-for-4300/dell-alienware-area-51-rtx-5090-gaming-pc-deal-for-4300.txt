Alienware has just dropped the price of its flagship Alienware Area-51 prebuilt gaming PC equipped with the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 graphics card starting at $4,299.99 with free shipping. This is the lowest price I've seen for an Alienware 5090 gaming PC and is reasonably competitive compared to other boutique PC builders. The GeForce RTX 5090 graphics card is currently the most powerful GPU on the market, and by a wide margin.Alienware Area-51 RTX 5090 Gaming PC From $4,299.99Alienware Area-51 Intel Core Ultra 7 265 RTX 5090 Gaming PC (32GB/1TB)6$4,949.99 save 13%$4,299.99 at Alienware360mm Liquid CoolerAlienware Area-51 Intel Core Ultra 9 285K RTX 5090 Gaming PC (32GB/2TB)31$5,499.99 save 15%$4,699.99 at AlienwareThis least expensive Alienware Area-51 RTX 5090 gaming PC configuration is equipped with an Intel Core Ultra 7 265K processor with 240mm liquid cooling, 32GB of DDR5-6400MHz RAM, and 1TB SSD.

The chassis is a super-sized upgrade to the 2024 R16 system with aesthetic and cooling redesigns and updated components. The I/O panel is positioned at the top of the case instead of the front, and the tempered glass window now spans the entire side panel instead of just a smaller cutout. As a result, the side panel vents are gone, and instead air intakes are located at the bottom as well as the front of the case. Alienware is now pushing a positive airflow design (more intake than exhaust airflow), which means a less dusty interior. The internal components have been refreshed with a new motherboard, faster RAM, and bigger power supply to accommodate the new generation of CPUs and GPUs.The RTX 5090 Is the Most Powerful Graphics Card EverThe Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 has emerged as the most powerful consumer GPU on the market. Although Nvidia has prioritized software updates, AI features, and DLSS 4 technology to improve gameplay performance, the 5090 still boasts an impressive 25%-30% uplift over the RTX 4090 in terms of pure hardware-based raster performance. The 5090 also has more (32GB vs. 24GB) and faster (GDDR7 vs. GDDR6) VRAM compared to the 4090.Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 FE Review by Jackie Thomas"The Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 has officially taken the performance crown from the RTX 4090, but with less force than previous generations. When it comes to traditional non-AI gaming performance, the RTX 5090 provides one of the smallest generational uplifts in recent memory. However, in games that support it, DLSS 4 really does deliver huge performance gains – you just have to make your peace with the fact that 75% of the frames are generated with AI."Check out more of the best Alienware dealsCheck out our Best Alienware Deals article with all of Dell's currently ongoing deals on gaming laptops and desktop PCs.
