These deals are, frankly, so good that they're worth picking up before Black Friday. This sale appears to be run by Walmart so you probably won't find these deals anywhere else (unless another retailer price matches). Prices on Nvidia GPUs have finally started trending downwards, and it's great to see that it's also having an effect on prebuilt gaming PCs as well.Walmart GeForce Week: The Best Gaming PC DealsTrending dealsAcer Nitro 60 AMD Ryzen 9 7900 RTX 5070 Ti Gaming PC for $1,499Acer Nitro 60 AMD Ryzen 7 7700 RTX 5070 Gaming PC for $1,099iBuypower Element Pro AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D RTX 5070 Gaming PC for $1,199Acer Nitro 60 Intel Core i5-14400F RTX 5060 Gaming PC (16GB/1TB)1$1,199.00 save 33%$799.00 at WalmartMSI Aegis R2 Intel Core i5-14400F RTX 5060 Gaming PC (16GB/1TB)2$999.00 save 20%$799.00 at WalmartCyberPowerPC Gamer Master AMD Ryzen 5 8400F RTX 5060 Gaming PC (16GB/1TB)0$979.00 save 18%$799.00 at WalmartiBuypower Element SE Intel Core Ultra 5 225F RTX 5060 Gaming PC (16GB/1TB)3$1,199.00 save 29%$849.00 at WalmartAcer Nitro 60 AMD Ryzen 7 7700 RTX 5070 Gaming PC (32GB/2TB)0$1,899.00 save 42%$1,099.00 at WalmartiBuypower Slate Intel Core i5-14400F RTX 5070 Gaming PC (16GB/1TB)5$1,499.00 save 27%$1,099.00 at WalmartiBuypower Element Pro AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D RTX 5070 Gaming PC (32GB/1TB)0$1,699.00 save 29%$1,199.00 at WalmartAcer Nitro 60 AMD Ryzen 9 7900 RTX 5070 Ti Gaming PC (32GB/2TB)1$2,399.00 save 38%$1,499.00 at WalmartAcer Nitro 60 Intel Core i7-14700F RTX 5070 Ti Gaming PC (32GB/2TB)4$2,299.00 save 28%$1,649.00 at WalmartSkytech Gaming King AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D RTX 5070 Ti

I've broken down the deals by graphics card, since that is the one of the biggest dictators of price. If you haven't yet done your research and aren't sure which level of PC is right for you, I'd suggest starting with the GPU (check out our GPU guide) and seeing which option below matches the resolution of your display and the type of game you intend to play. Games like Hollow Knight: Silksong are far less taxing on your PC than, say, Battlefield 6.RTX 5090 Prebuilt Gaming PC DealsSkytech Gaming Prism AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D RTX 5090 Gaming PC (64GB/2TB)1$5,399.00 save 30%$3,799.00 at WalmartHP Omen 45L Intel Core Ultra 9 285K RTX 5090 Gaming PC (64GB/2TB)1$4,499.00 save 16%$3,799.00 at WalmartRead our Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 reviewLet's start with the highest end gaming PCs first and move down from there. The Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 has emerged as the most powerful consumer GPU on the market. Although with this generation Nvidia has prioritized software updates, AI features, and DLSS 4 technology to improve gameplay performance, the 5090 still boasts an impressive 25%-30% uplift over the RTX 4090 in hardware-based raster performance. If you want the absolute best performance for your gaming PC, there is literally no other option from any other brand.RTX 5080 Prebuilt Gaming PC DealsAcer Nitro 60 AMD Ryzen 9 7900 RTX 5080 Gaming PC (64GB/2TB)0$2,999.00 save 30%$2,099.00 at WalmartSkytech Gaming Legacy AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D RTX 5080 Gaming PC (32GB/2TB)0$3,099.00 save 23%$2,399.00 at WalmartRead our Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 reviewPerformance-wise, the RTX 5080 is no slouch. It's one of the fastest cards on the market, bested only by the $2,000 RTX 5090 and the discontinued $1,600 RTX 4090. This is a phenomenal card for playing the latest, most demanding games in 4K resolution at high settings and ray tracing enabled and you'll save well over $1,000 by picking this over the 5090.RTX 5070 Ti Prebuilt Gaming PC DealsAcer Nitro 60 AMD Ryzen 9 7900 RTX 5070 Ti Gaming PC (32GB/2TB)1$2,399.00 save 38%$1,499.00 at WalmartAcer Nitro 60 Intel Core i7-14700F RTX 5070 Ti Gaming PC (32GB/2TB)4$2,299.00 save 28%$1,649.00 at WalmartSkytech Gaming King AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D RTX 5070 Ti

If you're looking to play games in 4K resolution at 60+ framerates, then the RTX 5070 Ti offers the best bang for your buck. It performs neck-and-neck with the RTX 4080 Super and is only about 10%-15% behind the RTX 5080, which may be a worthy tradeoff in order to save $400 compared to an RTX 5080 prebuilt. The RTX 5070 Ti also has 16GB of GDDR7 VRAM just like the 5080.RTX 5070 Prebuilt Gaming PC DealsAcer Nitro 60 AMD Ryzen 7 7700 RTX 5070 Gaming PC (32GB/2TB)0$1,899.00 save 42%$1,099.00 at WalmartiBuypower Slate Intel Core i5-14400F RTX 5070 Gaming PC (16GB/1TB)5$1,499.00 save 27%$1,099.00 at WalmartiBuypower Element Pro AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D RTX 5070 Gaming PC (32GB/1TB)0$1,699.00 save 29%$1,199.00 at WalmartRead our Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 reviewCompared to the previous generation GPUs, the RTX 5070 performs a bit better than the RTX 4070 Super. I wish there was a bigger generation improvement in raw performance, but the RTX 5070 is still a superior graphics card because it supports DLSS 4 and has 12GB of the newer GDDR7 VRAM on top of the slight performance improvement. You probably won't even find an RTX 4070 Super gaming PC for less than $1,100, either. The RTX 5070 is a popular GPU for 1080p or 1440 gaming. The next card up - the RTX 5070 Ti - is significantly more expensive and really for gamers who want high fps 1440p or 4K gaming. Anything less demanding and it's probably overkill.RTX 5060 Prebuilt Gaming PC DealsAcer Nitro 60 Intel Core i5-14400F RTX 5060 Gaming PC (16GB/1TB)1$1,199.00 save 33%$799.00 at WalmartMSI Aegis R2 Intel Core i5-14400F RTX 5060 Gaming PC (16GB/1TB)2$999.00 save 20%$799.00 at WalmartCyberPowerPC Gamer Master AMD Ryzen 5 8400F RTX 5060 Gaming PC (16GB/1TB)0$979.00 save 18%$799.00 at WalmartiBuypower Element SE Intel Core Ultra 5 225F RTX 5060 Gaming PC (16GB/1TB)3$1,199.00 save 29%$849.00 at WalmartRead our Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 reviewThe RTX 5060 performs about 15% better than the RTX 4060 that is replaces. It will run most games in 1080p at framerates of up to 60fps, although some games might require some settings adjustments. 1440p is a viable option too, although you will see an improvement bumping up to a 5060 Ti or 5070 at that point. Like all Blackwell GPUs, the RTX 5060 supports DLSS 4 with multi-frame generation, and the performance improvement over the 4060 will be bigger with games that support it.Why are some people disappointed by Nvidia's Blackwell cards?A lot of people have beef with Nvidia's new graphics cards, but it's not specifically about the product itself. The problem is with the rather lackluster generational improvement over the 40 series cards and the fact that these cards used to be tremendously marked up. If you're coming from an RTX 30 series card or older, or you're upgrading from a lower end GPU to a higher end one, then an RTX 50 series card is still one of your best options. RTX 40 series cards, however close in performance to the RTX 50 series they may be, are not readily sourceable, unless you want to take a risk buying a used one off without warranty on eBay or Facebook Marketplace. AMD cards, although a better value on paper, are still marked up in price (i.e. the $599 RTX 9070 XT is about $700 on Amazon).How to Follow IGN Deals RecommendationsThe IGN Deals team has over 30 years of combined experience finding the best discounts and preorders available online.
