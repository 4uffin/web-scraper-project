As Nintendo is wont to do, the company is also releasing a pair of amiibo figures to go along with the new game. There’s a Kirby and Warp Star amiibo and a Bandana Waddle Dee and Winged Star. They both retail for (a somewhat shocking) $49.99, and are set to release the same day as the game itself. The reason for the extra expense is that these are more elaborate than most amiibo figures. With each of them, you get a character and a vehicle that work together in interesting ways, particularly if you have both figures. Read on for the details.Kirby and Warp Star amiibo - Kirby Air Riders SeriesOut November 20Kirby and Warp Star amiibo0Kirby Star Riders series.$49.99 at AmazonGet it at Amazon - $49.99Get it at Walmart - $49.99Get it at Best Buy - $49.99Get it at GameStop - $49.99See it at Target - Not availableThis amiibo contains a happy-looking Kirby figure and a Warp Star vehicle for him to ride in.Bandana Waddle Dee and Winged Star amiibo - Kirby Air Riders SeriesOut November 20Bandana Waddle Dee and Winged Star amiibo0Kirby Star Riders series.$49.99 at AmazonGet it at Amazon - $49.99Get it at Walmart - $49.99Get it at Best Buy - $49.99Get it at GameStop - $49.99See it at Target - Not availableThis amiibo has Bandana Waddle Dee and a Winged Star vehicle you can place him in.How the Kirby Air Riders amiibo WorkSo how do these things work, exactly? When you put Kirby on the Warp Star vehicle and tap it on your Switch 2 controller, it creates an in-game Figure Player (think NPC) that will race around the tracks in your matches. As the FP competes in races, it will level up, and its machine proficiency level will also increase. (Machine proficiency is basically a score for that character-and-vehicle combo).If you have both of the above amiibo figures, you can swap riders on the vehicles. That way, you can have an FP of Kirby riding on the Winged Star, or Bandana Waddle Dee riding on the Warp Star. When you do this, the FP character maintains its level, but starts from zero in its machine proficiency since it’s a new vehicle. You can watch the video above to see it in action.Nintendo says more of these Kirby Air Riders amiibo will be released in the future, creating more character/machine combinations for your FPs. Also, Nintendo is planning a second Kirby Air Riders Direct hosted by Sakurai, during which he may offer additional details about these (and upcoming) amiibo.Preorder Kirby Airy RidersOut November 20Kirby Airy Riders2$69.99 at AmazonIf you are getting the amiibo, then surely you'll want the game, which can be purchased above.
