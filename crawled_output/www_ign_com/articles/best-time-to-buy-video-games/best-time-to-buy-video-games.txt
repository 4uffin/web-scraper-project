That being said, sales events like Black Friday tend to be the best time to do so. But what happens if you miss your shot to pick up a game you wanted while it was discounted or it ran out of stock? Don’t worry, sale events actually happen all throughout the year, so there are plenty of other opportunities to get games at a cheaper price. For example, you'll likely see plenty of game deals during Prime Day sales this year. No matter which platform you prefer to play on, there’s always a deal to find somewhere, whether that’s during a sale event or at a retailer.Retailers like Amazon, GameStop, Best Buy, Walmart, and Target usually offer discounts on games throughout the year or Buy 1, Get 1 Free deals, but oftentimes the best deals are found during these big sale events. To help you save on video games in 2025, we’ve rounded up some of the best sale events for games that happen over the course of the year that are worth keeping an eye on. There’s no better time to buy video games than when they’re discounted, and we’re here to help you plan ahead for those times.For the Best Time to Buy Video Games, Keep in Mind…Sale Events: Black Friday and Cyber MondayAmazon Prime DayOctober Prime DayPublisher Events: PlayStationXboxNintendoSteamEpic Games StoreBlack Friday and Cyber MondayBlack Friday and Cyber Monday deals begin in earnest at the end of November, kicking off the holiday season in style with a variety of sales on different items. If you’re looking to pick up some new games, this is an excellent time to do so. Thankfully, you can find deals at a variety of different retailers as well, from Amazon to Best Buy to GameStop.If you’re curious about what you can expect from each of these retailers ahead of their actual sales events, you can usually check out the Black Friday ads from last year. Many of the bigger retailers will often have similar types of products on sale every year, and Black Friday 2025 will most likely look a lot like it did in 2024.If you’re looking to pick up some discounted games, planning ahead is usually a good idea. You never know when stock will run out, so it’s a good idea to figure out which games you want from your list before checking out different retailers. It’s also a good idea to compare prices between retailers during the sale event. Sometimes, a game will be marked down 30% at one outlet and 40% at another, so keep multiple tabs open to see which retailer has the better deal.How much are you willing to spend on a video game?$20$30$40$50$60$70+AnswerSee ResultsAmazon Prime DaySimilar to Black Friday, Amazon Prime Day is another excellent opportunity to pick up games if you're a Prime member. It occurs earlier in the year as well, usually around the end of June or start of July, so you have some time between the two sale events to figure out which games are next on your purchase list. However, unlike Black Friday which gives you the opportunity to check out multiple retailers, Prime Day is usually just Amazon unless you have a competitor that counters the sale day with their own selections.Similar to Black Friday, a good general Prime Day shopping tip is that you’ll want to make a list of games that you want to buy. This will help you figure out what to look for but also help with setting a budget so you don’t go wild buying everything in sight. Another helpful planning tool is using a website like camelcamelcamel, which shows the price history on an Amazon product so you can see how often a game you like goes on sale and at what price. This can help you figure out if it’s a better buy during Prime Day or if it’s better to wait until the holiday season to pick it up.Do You Prefer to Shop on Prime Day or Black Friday?I prefer to shop on Prime DayI prefer to shop on Black FridayI'll shop whenever there are deals!AnswerSee ResultsPrime Big Deal DaysAmazon also has an event called Prime Big Deal Days that usually takes place around October, giving buyers a sneak peek at what’s to come during the holiday shopping season for Black Friday. It also features a few similar Prime-exclusive discounts to the ones in its earlier Prime Day sale, so it’s a good time to pick something up again if you missed it earlier on.Amazon has announced that it's October Prime Day sale will be taking place on October 7-8 this year, so that will likely be your next chance to save this year.PlayStation Sale EventsThe PlayStation Store has sales quite frequently, which is great news. If you tab over to the ‘Deals’ section of the store, you can usually find curated sets of deals listed as Essential Picks, Games Under a certain amount, etc. You can also find these deals broken down by PS4 deals and PS5 deals. These are updated frequently as well, so when one sale runs out a new one will usually take its place. Sometimes they even have fun themes, like a collection of horror game deals around Halloween!More importantly, though, PlayStation also has big seasonal sale events throughout the year, which is where some of their best discounts are. During the spring they’ll usually have a Spring Sale which is followed by Days of Play and a Summer Sale during the summer months. Then, as you approach the holiday season, you’ll usually find a PS5 Black Friday Sale in November, and a Holiday Sale at the end of the year. The specific dates for these events are usually announced on PlayStation’s social media as well, so keep an eye out for any announcements there.If you’re a PlayStation Plus Extra or Premium member, you also get access to exclusive discounts in the PlayStation Store. To learn more about these subscriptions, check out our breakdown of each PlayStation Plus tier.Xbox Sale EventsSimilar to PlayStation, Xbox frequently has sales going on under the store’s ‘Deals’ section, which are usually pulled into curated lists as well with different themes, but they also have big seasonal sales throughout the year. These bigger sales come around during wintertime, like the Xbox Black Friday sale or their Countdown Sale which occurs later in December, in spring with a Spring Sale, and in the summer for their Deals Unlocked Sale and Ultimate Game Sale. Their Deals Unlocked Sale usually kicks off in early June around Summer Games Fest time and the Ultimate Game Sale is usually around July. Again, keep an eye on Xbox’s social media for announcements of when these specific sale events will kick off.And, like those with a PlayStation Plus membership, if you have Game Pass Ultimate or Game Pass Core, you get access to exclusive store discounts. To learn more about these subscription plans, check out our breakdown of Xbox Game Pass plans, explained.Nintendo Sale EventsNintendo isn’t one to offer massive discounts on their first-party games often, but the eShop almost always has sales going on if you tab over to their ‘Great Deals’ section. Almost every season is a decent time to find Nintendo Switch deals if you like a wide variety of games. With the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2, it's more than likely we see console bundles with new Nintendo game releases. Outside of Switch Black Friday deals, though, Nintendo will usually have seasonal sales year-round in the eShop, like a Summer Sale in early June, that feature great discounts. Nintendo Switch games are also frequently found on sale at various retailers, like Best Buy or Amazon, so it’s worth it to check them out to see what’s available.Steam Sale EventsIf you want to find excellent deals on PC games, Steam has always got a little something in their store. Alongside having a variety of discounted games to look through anyway in their ‘Specials’ section, they also offer seasonal sale events four times a year (Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter), themed sale events (called Fests), and Next Fest. The latter also gives players a chance to try out demos, watch livestreams, and learn about what new games are coming to Steam.The Steam Summer Sale is now has ended for 2025. There are always other Steam and PC game deals going outside of this sale, but right now is the best time of the year to find new discounts.Final Fantasy VII Rebirth10$69.99 save 40%$41.99 at SteamThe Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered8$49.99 save 20%$39.99 at SteamR.E.P.O.3$9.99 save 20%$7.99 at SteamKingdom Come: Deliverance II5$59.99 save 20%$47.99 at SteamBaldur's Gate 38$59.99 save 20%$47.99 at SteamDynasty Warriors: Origins3$69.99 save 23%$53.89 at SteamMarvel's Spider-Man 23$59.99 save 20%$47.99 at SteamAssassin's Creed Shadows4$69.99 save 25%$52.49 at SteamGhost of Tsushima Director's Cut6$59.99 save 33%$40.19 at Steam$59.99 save 33%$40.19 at HumbleClair Obscur: Expedition 3314$49.99 save 10%$44.99 at SteamIndiana Jones and the Great Circle4$69.99 save 20%$55.99 at SteamBlue Prince7$29.99 save 15%$25.49 at SteamMonster Hunter Wilds3$69.99 save 20%$55.99 at SteamCrash Bandicoot N.

Alongside Deals of the Week – which offers new deals every Tuesday – and a variety of sales going on that you can look through regularly, they also offer seasonal sale events, themed sales, a MEGA Sale early in the summer around May/June (where you can find some of their best deals), and a Black Friday and Holiday sale.More Video Game Shopping TipsAlongside the sale events listed above, sometimes just waiting a couple of months or so after a new game comes out can land a good deal in your lap. Though it’s rarer to see discounts from first-party exclusives, it’s worth keeping an eye on Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy anyway, just in case. They likely won’t be marked down as much as they are during the bigger sale events listed above, but they’re still worth a look every now and again. And we’ll make sure to keep you in the loop on all new game deals in our roundups of Xbox deals, PlayStation deals, Nintendo deals, and video game deals.Hannah Hoolihan is a freelance writer who works with the Guides and Commerce teams here at IGN.Originally posted: Sep 17, 2025 2:30 pmReviews•Editor Columns•News•Guides•Upcoming Sales Events•How to Watch Guides•Board Game Reviews•GTA 5 Cheats•Best Streaming Bundles•IGN Store•Top Deals•Contact Us•IGN YouTube•HowLongToBeat•IGN TikTok•IGN Twitter•Map Genie•Eurogamer•Rock Paper Shotgun•VG247•Maxroll•Privacy Policy•Terms of Use
