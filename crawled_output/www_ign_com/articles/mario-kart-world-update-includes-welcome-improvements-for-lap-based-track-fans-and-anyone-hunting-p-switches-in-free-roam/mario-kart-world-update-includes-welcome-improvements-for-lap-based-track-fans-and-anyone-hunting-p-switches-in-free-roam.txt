A fresh update for Nintendo Switch 2 launch title Mario Kart World has once again improved the frequency of lap-based courses, meaning fewer tracks that require you to drive for miles through the game's open world in order to get started. There are some welcome adjustments to racing generally, too, with slightly more time spent invincible after spinning or crashing out during a race — so you have a fairer chance at getting back on track. Item boxes will now take slightly less time to refresh, also.For those who do enjoy the game's open world, improvements have been made there, too. Nintendo has added the locations of previously-found P Switches and Peach Medallions to the map for easier tracking, and you can now warp to P Switches if you want to go replay them. These latest changes to the frequency of lap-based courses follow an earlier U-turn by Nintendo after it initially made it harder to encounter traditional three-lap Mario Kart tracks. The move was criticised by fans, and later reversed in July's patch.Last week, Sega began promoting its rival kart racer Sonic Racing: Crossworlds with a cheeky trailer that poked fun at Mario Kart World's dull open world. Maybe Nintendo noticed?Other tweaks include the ability to join friends in Knockout Tour, and encounter UFOs more easily in Free Roam.
