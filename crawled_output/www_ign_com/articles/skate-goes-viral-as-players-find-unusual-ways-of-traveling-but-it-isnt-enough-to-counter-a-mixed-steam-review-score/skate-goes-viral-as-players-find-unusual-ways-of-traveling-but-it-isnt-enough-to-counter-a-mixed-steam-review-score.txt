Or, as this player puts it: "Bro what am I even playing rn why is this faster than skating."Man you don't even know pic.twitter.com/4XIlCEdKx4— Konto (@KontoLetzPlay) September 16, 2025 Apparently, anyone can move like this, too. As KontoLetzPlay explains, you just need to hold forward and then move back and forth between a roll and a spread eagle as you go. "The roll is quick and pushing off with a jump in the roll is good," they said. "Meanwhile; the spread eagle gives you speed in the air, as well as a slight boost once you land on the ground, since it puts you into a slide. It's extremely simple, but it does take some slight getting used to, considering the devs definitely didn't build the movement to be used this way. But it's just: Roll > Push off from roll > spread eagle > automatically land in a slide > slide into a roll > push off from roll > repeat."Flailing around the map hijinx aside, Steam reviews suggests not everyone's having as good a time, though, as the 6,300+ user reviews left so far have put Skate on a 'Mixed' aggregate score, with PC players complaining of crashing, poor voice acting, and "missing" features like Hall of Meat and Pro Skaters.not sure what the big deal is, skating is clearly way faster and more realistic 🙄 https://t.co/CQ51RlgETy pic.twitter.com/LQ12uVXz3j— berd (@berdyaboi) September 17, 2025 "If you're looking for a true successor to Skate 1, 2, and 3, this isn’t it," wrote one reviewer. "Aside from the controls, every other gameplay element from the previous titles has been stripped away. No Hall of Meat, no Game of Skate, no missions or storylines with real-life pros. In their absence, we got a soulless cash-grab with a fully functional cash shop inside a 7GB beta. I can’t believe I waited years for this.""Online only slop with day one server issues, same challenges over and over for ripoff chips for a spin on the lootbox casino for frankly terrible cosmetics, none of the gamemodes that made the previous games fun, No S.k.a.t.e, deathraces, own the spot career or hall of meat, the art style is not what the devs promised in earlier playtest builds, character creation and customisation is abysmal," opined one unhappy player.It's not all bad news, though. "I figured people would review bomb it when it came out," said a less critical fan. "Listen, this game is great. It's one of the best feeling skate games that we have out right now. I understand people are upset about no story mode and missing features but it's in early access... what don't people understand about that?"Skate was originally announced by publisher EA way back in 2020, and development has continued slowly but surely ever since. The game has previously been playable by fans within closed community playtests that have even seen the introduction of microtransactions for cosmetic items, if you were wondering how EA plans to monetise the game."I can clearly see the direction developer Full Circle is taking the series, but I can also say that Skate is shaping up to be a game worthy of being the long-awaited sequel to 2010’s Skate 3," IGN wrote in our Skate hands-on preview earlier this year. "The gameplay seems refined and lives up to its predecessors, the world is big and fun to explore, and the overall sandbox’s 'do what you want' vibe is really making me look forward to diving back in."Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.
