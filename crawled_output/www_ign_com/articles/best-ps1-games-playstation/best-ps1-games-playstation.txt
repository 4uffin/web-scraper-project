Games and technology have evolved by leaps and bounds in the three decades since Sony's first console arrived on the scene, but it’s impossible to deny the lasting impact the PS1 had on the games industry and pop culture at large.From the jorts-wearing Crash Bandicoot to the no-nonsense Solid Snake, the original PlayStation is single-handedly responsible for some of the most iconic video game characters and franchises. But which PS1 games are the best of the best?It wasn't easy, but we've put together our pick of the very best PS1 games, including some great PlayStation exclusives, generation-defining icons, and timeless classics. Here are the 25 best PS1 games of all time.You Might Also Like:Best PlayStation Games of All TimeBest PS2 Games of All TimeBest PS3 Games of All TimeBest PS4 Games of All TimeBest PS5 Games25. PaRappa the RapperDeveloper: NanaOn-Sha | Publisher: Sony Computer Entertainment | Release date: December 6, 1996 | Review: IGN's PaRappa the Rapper reviewBefore Rock Band, before Guitar Hero, and even before Dance Dance Revolution, there was Parappa the Rapper. An unlikely rapping game starring a cartoonishly flat dog and his animal pals, Parappa won us all over with catchy songs and a quirky charm that stood out among other games seeking to posture themselves as “extreme” or “hardcore” on the PS1. Nothing else on the console looked like Parappa (until Um Jammer Lammy arrived, of course). This rhyme-spitting canine is so beloved, in
fact, that we named him one of the top 10 dogs in video games. I gotta believe!24. Oddworld: Abe’s OddyseeImage credit: Oddworld InhabitantsDeveloper: Oddworld Inhabitants | Publisher: GT Interactive | Release date: September 18, 1997 | Review: IGN's Oddworld: Abe’s Oddysee reviewOddworld Inhabitant’s debut project is such a weird game; a fiendishly difficult action/puzzle/platformer with a crazy Soylent Green-like story. Oddworld: Abe’s Odyssey is fondly remembered for its bonkers character design and deep lore, which directly feeds into its core goal: to help guide as many workers as possible to safety through a deadly factory. But escaping your evil corporate overlords is no easy feat, as meat-grinding machinery and murderous security guards stand in your way on every screen. What we particularly love about Abe's Odyssey is its unique features; in particular, its systems for communicating and working together with your fellow Mudokons and the ability to telepathically possess others or manipulate them into taking out your enemies for you. Don't think - drink!23. Spider-ManDeveloper: Neversoft | Publisher: Activision | Release date: August 30, 2000 | Review: IGN's Spider-Man reviewDeveloped by Neversoft (the developer behind the Tony Hawk franchise), PS1’s Spider-Man served as the template for pretty much all the good superhero games to follow. This was the first Spider-Man game many of us played to really capture Spidey’s unique method of traversal, swinging between buildings, climbing up walls and acrobatically taking down enemies. It's also filled with easter eggs and secrets, including many, many Marvel cameos (like the Human Torch and Daredevil), and unlockable costumes, like Spider-Man 2099, the Amazing Bag Man costume or even his classic Captain Universe getup. They even got Stan Lee himself to do the descriptions of each character in the character viewer!22. Medal of HonorImage credit: Electronic ArtsDeveloper: Dreamworks Interactive | Publisher: EA | Release date: November 10, 1999 (NA) | Review: IGN's Medal of Honor reviewThere wasn’t an enormous list of must-play first-person shooters on the original PlayStation – the genre simply wasn’t as ubiquitous on consoles at that time as it is today. There are a handful that carved out a legacy, like Quake II, or Disruptor, but probably none did so more successfully than the incredible Medal of Honor. Wolfenstein 3D may be the granddaddy of FPS WW2 action, but Medal of Honor, produced by none other than Steven Spielberg, was the series to really drag it into the third dimension, kicking and screaming, “Rennt um euer leben – er hat ‘ne Panzerfaust!”A deep, superbly-acted storyline, lengthy twist-filled missions reminiscent of Goldeneye, and realistic weaponry allowed Medal of Honor stand above every other FPS that graced the PS1.
21. Ape EscapeImage credit: SonyDeveloper: Sony Computer Entertainment | Publisher: Sony Computer Entertainment | Release date: June 18, 1999 | Review: IGN's Ape Escape reviewNowadays, holding a PlayStation controller without the analog sticks feels almost unnatural – like wearing someone else’s shoes, or when your arm falls asleep after leaning on it wrong. But there was a time when the DualShock controller seemed like an unnecessary gimmick. How do you rally players to adopt this new technology? You present them with the threat of rampant, mischievous apes.As the title would suggest, Ape Escape tells the timeless tale of a group of mischievous primates on the loose. Players are given the urgent task of subduing them with variety of gadgets regularly implemented by real life animal control specialists, such as a hula hoop, remote control car, and a device like a kayak paddle that you can spin around really fast to achieve flight. Each of these gadgets is controlled by waggling the DualShock’s right stick, a concept that was akin to rubbing your stomach and patting your head back in 1999. Nowadays, such a mechanic would be deemed “gimmicky,” but the late ‘90s was a simpler time, and Ape Escape’s solid implementation stuck the landing. Oddly enough, Ape Escape proved to be oddly prescient; in 2016, a chimpanzee named Chacha escaped from a Japanese zoo, and local police were able to subdue him safely – presumably thanks to simulations they’d run in Ape Escape.20. Crash Team RacingDeveloper: Naughty Dog | Publisher: Sony Computer Entertainment | Release date: September 30, 1999 | Review: IGN's Crash Team Racing reviewWhile many have come for the Mario Kart throne, Crash Team Racing, surprisingly, is perhaps the kart racer to come closest. Long before its modern-day remake, Crash Team Racing: Nitro-Fueled, the original CTR surprised and delighted fans with a mascot racer worthy of excitement alongside Nintendo's long-standing franchise.Featuring a varied and fun set of original tracks, wacky weapons that smartly pull from existing Crash lore, and an innovative, skill-based drifting/boost system, Crash Team Racing remains one of the more beloved entries in the kart racing pantheon to this day.19. Syphon FilterImage credit: SonyDeveloper: Eidetic Games | Publisher: Sony Computer Entertainment | Release date: January 31, 1999 | Review: IGN's Syphon Filter reviewPulling inspiration from hit games like Metal Gear Solid and GoldenEye, Eidetic Games – now known as Sony Bend – concocted its own unique blend of stealth and action to create Syphon Filter. With a wide assortment of fun weaponry, you are given a good amount of freedom to approach problems in many different ways throughout the 20-odd levels of espionage action. Perhaps most memorably, you can tase enemies to death, preempting the whole “don’t tase me bro” fiasco by nearly a decade.18. Soul Reaver: Legacy of KainDeveloper: Crystal Dynamics | Publisher: Eidos Interactive | Release date: April 1, 1998 | Review: IGN's Soul Reaver: Legacy of Kain reviewPerhaps more accurately titled “Legacy of Kain 2”, Soul Reaver: Legacy of Kain is an incredible second chapter in what might be one of the most underrated game series ever. Gothic and macabre, Soul Reaver is more like a grimdark Ocarina of Time than its top-down, action RPG predecessor, Blood Omen. Shifting between the world of the living and the spectral plane to solve puzzles and traverse the twisting corridors of Nosgoth is just the tip of Soul Reaver’s mechanical brilliance, and part of why it would prove deeply influential beyond the PS1 era. The characters and story, penned and directed by Uncharted’s Amy Hennig, are miles above most games of the era. Despite a rushed and anti-climactic ending, Soul Reaver stands on its own and deifies Kain in a fantastic re-introduction to the series.17. Final Fantasy TacticsImage credit: Square EnixDeveloper: Square | Publisher: Sony Computer Entertainment | Release date: January 28, 1998 (NA) | Review: IGN's Final Fantasy Tactics reviewWhen Final Fantasy Tactics arrived in 1998, it was arguably the best turn-based strategy game ever to grace consoles. Even today, there are few in the genre that have even come close to matching its majesty. The juxtaposition of cute yet super-deformed characters works well, especially when they get caught up in one of the most complicated video game plots of all time. This is yet another game that, alongside Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, proved the PlayStation didn’t have to rely on fancy 3D graphics. All that considered, it’s a shame we’ve never gotten a true sequel.16. Ridge Racer Type 4Image credit: NamcoDeveloper: Namco | Publisher: Namco | Release date: May 4, 1999 (NA) | Review: IGN's Ridge Racer Type 4 reviewThe words Ridge Racer are now best known for being shouted by an overexuberant Kaz Hirai at E3 2006, but years before that it was PlayStation’s standout driving game. Ridge Racer Type 4 hit a sweet spot between the sim trappings of Gran Turismo and the white-knuckle speed of WipeOut, carving out its own corner as one of the most popular games on the original Sony console.15. XenogearsImage credit: Square EnixDeveloper: Square Product Development Division 3 | Publisher: Squaresoft | Release date: October 20, 1998 (NA) | Review: IGN's Ridge Racer Type 4 reviewOriginally pitched as a plotline in Square’s Final Fantasy 7, Xenogears became its own landmark RPG when it emerged one year later in 1998. Combining a martial arts-infused version of the Active Time Battle combat system established in both FF and Chrono Trigger with an engaging story that weaved in and out of both sci-fi and religious themes in a style not a million miles away from Star Wars, it quickly became one of the PlayStation’s essential adventures. Its legacy has endured – even if it never did receive a direct sequel – with the spiritual successor Xenosaga and Xenoblade Chronicles series continuing to find a hungry audience to this day.14. Final Fantasy 9Image credit: Square EnixDeveloper: Square | Publisher: Square Electronic Arts | Release date: July 7, 2000 | Review: IGN's Final Fantasy 9 reviewFinal Fantasy 9 promised a return to the series’ fantasy roots, and it absolutely delivered. Knights, mages, princesses, crystals, and all of the Final Fantasy mainstays from the early days of the series were present and accounted for, but what people still love most about it are the characters. Wily Zidane, sad and naive Vivi, doofy loyalist Steiner, and a dozen other memorable party members and allies helped make Final Fantasy 9 an incredible way to close out the series’ first steps into three dimensions. It paid reverence to the games that came before it, and set the stage for the next era. It is a beautiful, moving swan song for Final Fantasy on the PlayStation.See our guide to the Final Fantasy games in order.13. Silent HillImage credit: KonamiDeveloper: Team Silent | Publisher: Konami | Release date: February 23, 1999 | Review: IGN's Silent Hill reviewThe original Silent Hill slid off the beaten path of the zombie survival horror du jour into something much more daring and unknown. The town of Silent Hill is an obtuse place to visit, full of nonsensical, psychosexual creatures that prod at protagonist Henry’s sanity; much more Jacob’s Ladder than Night of the Living Dead.Its foreboding atmosphere is made more unbearable by the fact that Harry is the definition of an ‘everyman,’ and it's much smarter to run than it is to fight, wildly shooting at whatever is emerging from the fog. A defining psychological horror game, Silent Hill (and its audio that still rattles around in the brain to this day), is impossible to forget.And with the release of the fantastic Silent Hill 2 remake, we're hoping the upcoming remake of the original game will showcase Silent Hill's enduring qualities.12. Spyro 2: Ripto’s RageDeveloper: Insomniac Games | Publisher: Sony Computer Entertainment | Release date: November 2, 1999 | Review: IGN's Spyro 2: Ripto’s Rage reviewLike its fuzzier down-under brother, Spyro 2: Ripto's Rage (called Spyro 2: Gateway to Glimmer in some regions) smartly builds off the groundwork of the original game and offers a wonderful balance of challenge and fun. While the series would eventually lean more into playable secondary characters with Spyro: Year of the Dragon, Ripto's Rage keeps the emphasis largely on Spyro and a richly realized world.Working with the theme of seasonal hub areas, Spyro's second journey spins off into any number of unique and memorable mini-worlds, from beaches to thundery hills to mountaintop monasteries. A plethora of side characters, a host of smart collectibles, and an unexpected adventure in the land of Avalar make Spyro 2: Ripto's Rage a standout in the great Insomniac trilogy. And thanks to the Spyro Reignited Trilogy, you can now play it on modern consoles.11. DriverImage credit: GT InteractiveDeveloper: Reflections Interactive | Publisher: GT Interactive | Release date: June 25, 1999 | Review: IGN's Driver reviewOne of the earliest games you spent in a car that didn’t really qualify as a “racing game,” 1999’s Driver is a unique blend of open-world mission design and destructive arcade driving action. While its ambitious sequel introduced novel new concepts such as being able to get out of your car a full year before GTA 3 released, and the astounding ability (for the time) to render curved roads, it wasn’t as impactful as the pure, unadulterated rush of classic car chase goodness that the original Driver provides. From the deeply satisfying squelch of crumpling steel under its detailed collision modelling to the surprisingly deep Director Mode that lets you turn your wildest mission and free-roam moments into your own Hollywood action sequences, Driver handily e-brake slides into the PS1 hall of fame.10. Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes BackImage credit: SonyDeveloper: Naughty Dog | Publisher: Sony Computer Entertainment | Release date: November 5, 1997 | Review: IGN's Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back reviewNaughty Dog's mascot platformer trilogy is synonymous with the original PlayStation, but it’s the second of the three games that has remained in our hearts and minds all these years later. Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back is a great middle-ground between the original's platforming and Warped's expansive arsenal, techniques, and secrets. As Crash climbs his way up a series of chambers full of challenging platforming levels, Naughty Dog's gauntlet of jumping, spinning, and "woah" -ing offers some of the series’ best levels, providing a true challenge but in a way that always felt achievable.9. Vagrant StoryDeveloper: Square | Publisher: Square | Release date: May 16, 2000 | Review: IGN's Vagrant Story reviewVagrant Story is perhaps one of the original PlayStation's most underrated games – a massive action RPG developed by a powerhouse RPG hit machine, and helmed by Yasumi Matsuno, one of the lesser-known auteurs of the last 30 years. It’s a game that, in many ways, almost shouldn’t work; it stacks an almost ludicrous amount of systems on top of a plot dense with political intrigue, dark magic, and at least two textbooks' worth of ancient history. But it all comes together in a truly exceptional experience.You manage special attacks, customize weapons tailored for specific enemy types, build your own armor, solve puzzles, and fight some of the hardest bosses this side of Dark Souls using a quasi-rhythm-based battle system. While it remains an oft-forgotten entry in Square’s PlayStation catalogue, that doesn't prevent this hidden gem from being one of the best the console had to offer.8. Tekken 3Image credit: NamcoDeveloper: Namco | Publisher: Namco | Release date: Mar 1, 1997 | Review: IGN's Tekken 3 reviewThe universally-acclaimed Tekken 3 remains one of the most-respected fighting games ever made, but it was its astonishing ability to lure in even non-fighting game fans that helped make Tekken 3 one of the most iconic games on the console. Adding a third axis to the action and allowing players to dodge left and right, circling their opponents, was a seismic shift for Namco’s seminal slugfest. A cocktail of wacky cinematics, eclectic characters, and bruising beatings, the King of Iron Fist tournament is the undisputed champ when it comes to PS1 fighting games, and will always remain up there with the very best fighters in the business. At the very least, it’s definitely the reason an entire generation of gamers knows what capoeira is: cheers, Eddy Gordo.All these years later, the series has now moved on to acclaimed Tekken 8, which released in 2024.7. Resident Evil 2Developer: Capcom | Publisher: Capcom | Release date: January 21, 1998 | Review: IGN's Resident Evil 2 reviewThough it enjoyed a firecracker of a remake in 2019, the power of the original Resident Evil 2 is still untouched as one of the best Resident Evil games. Set in a bizarro police station – an elaborate evolution of the first game’s haunted house theme – Resident Evil 2 combines ornate, weird puzzles with a plethora of nasties that range from the garden-variety zombie to more out-there monstrosities like a giant moth and sentient, mutated poison ivy.Throw in a hulking, seemingly invulnerable tyrant that relentlessly pursues you and the ability to play through from two different perspectives, and you’ve got an all-time horror classic. The original Resident Evil may arguably be more important, but Leon and Clair’s escape from Raccoon City is undoubtedly the most accomplished of the series’ PS1 era.6. Tomb RaiderImage credit: Eidos InteractiveDeveloper: Core Design | Publisher: Eidos Interactive | Release date: November 14, 1996 | Review: IGN's Tomb Raider reviewThe original Tomb Raider is, at heart, a haunting solo adventure. It's a quiet jaunt through an aggressive world home to real-life beasts like wolves and bears, as well as more unusual options such as dinosaurs and cat... mummies? While it cemented Lara Croft as a video game icon for several more generations, the original Tomb Raider should also be celebrated for its genius – developer Core Design’s intricate level design produced some properly awe-inspiring environments. Plus, the thunderous blast of Lara’s shotgun is one that you can still feel through the ages.See our guide to the Tomb Raider games in order.5. Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 2Developer: Neversoft | Publisher: Activision | Release date: September 20, 2000 | Review: IGN's Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 2 reviewTony Hawk’s Pro Skater 2 isn’t just regarded by many as the most monumental game in the series, and it isn’t just considered as one of the greatest sports games ever made; it’s one of the highest-rated video games of all time.Marrying exquisite arcade extreme sports action with a soundtrack that launched a million mixtapes, the original Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater is one of the most influential and iconic games of its era. And by adding more moves, a simple but wildly addictive skate park editor, and a sackful of more searingly good songs, this stunning sequel became a spectacular refinement of the formula and an absolute cultural haymaker.4. Gran Turismo 2Developer: Polyphony Digital | Publisher: Sony Computer Entertainment | Release date: November 30, 1999 | Review: IGN's Gran Turismo 2 reviewTaking nothing away from the original, pioneering Gran Turismo – the best-selling PlayStation game of all time and the godfather of all console racing sims – Gran Turismo 2 is everything the first installment is and much, much more: an absolute gorilla of a racing game, so stuffed with content it had to ship on two CDs. With almost 650 cars from over 30 manufacturers, the scope of GT2 was unprecedented at the time of its release, dwarfing its otherwise excellent 1999 crosstown rival, Need for Speed: High Stakes. The PS1 played host to a small but fondly-remembered selection of serious racing games back in the late ’90s – like the TOCA and Colin McRae series – but Gran Turismo 2 is the biggest and broadest of the lot (and it's the only one that came with a scratch ’n’ sniff disc).3. Castlevania: Symphony of the NightImage credit: KonamiDeveloper: Konami | Publisher: Konami | Release date: March 20, 1997 | Review: IGN's Castlevania: Symphony of the Night reviewReleasing an "old-looking" 2D Castlevania on the PlayStation seemed like a strange move to some in 1997 – even IGN's original review reads: "It looks like the same old 2D platform action as before." Other classic franchises had already made the jump into the third dimension, and new games like Tomb Raider were showing what the PS1 could do that previous consoles could not, but keeping Castlevania: Symphony of the Night 2D allowed Konami to refine the gameplay to absolute perfection, and its beautiful pixel art has aged much better than most of its 3D contemporaries.Then there’s the incredible soundtrack, which fans are still humming to this day. Castlevania: Symphony of the Night is about as close to a perfect video game as you can get, one that is still being copied and iterated on by modern developers to this day.2. Final Fantasy 7Image credit: Sony/Square EnixDeveloper: Square | Publisher: Sony Computer Entertainment | Release date: January 31, 1997
| Review: IGN's Final Fantasy 7 reviewIn comparison to the new and exciting remake project, the original Final Fantasy 7 looks a little quaint. The winds of time and technological progress will do that. But this landmark Japanese RPG was a game changer for Sony; not only did it see developer Squaresoft defect from Nintendo in order to use the power of the PlayStation to create the first-ever 3D Final Fantasy, it also communicated that Sony’s console could deliver much more than just arcade and sports games on your TV. Final Fantasy 7 showed everyone that PlayStation was the new home of epic adventures delivered on multiple discs.Those achievements may be a thing of the past now, but Final Fantasy 7’s legacy endures because of the elements that refuse to age. Its cast of detailed, emotionally-driven characters develop over the course of a journey that balances personal stakes against the backdrop of a looming apocalypse. Similar balance is found in tone; this is a game with weight and heft that thrives on idiosyncrasies - a variety of bizarre enemies, comedic minigames, and absurdly sized swords. It's this combination of light and dark that makes Final Fantasy 7 such an enduring classic.1. Metal Gear SolidDeveloper: Konami | Publisher: Konami | Release date: September 3, 1998 | Review: IGN's Metal Gear Solid reviewLong before we had the intricate sandbox of The Phantom Pain, and before the twisting plots of The Patriots or bloated diatribes on the complex political realities of war, the third entry in Hideo Kojima's Metal Gear series cardboard-box-crawled its way onto the PS1 and things were never the same again.Metal Gear Solid offers a singularly unique blend of stealth/action gameplay, and couples it with a wholly bizarre yet utterly delightful cast of characters and a story that challenges our ideas of traditional video game "heroes." This pushed the boundaries of cinematic storytelling in video games further than they had ever been pushed before, and with it established the now-hallmark formula of Sony’s blockbuster single-player games. All of these exceptional elements, plus some truly unforgettable breaks in the fourth wall, combine to create a gaming experience that still holds up as one of the best within the Metal Gear series.Honorable MentionsChoosing the absolute best PlayStation games was wildly difficult, and as we’re a diverse group of fans with wildly varied tastes, not everyone’s favorites could make the list. In consideration of that, we wanted to give some final shoutouts to the following games which are also quite excellent:EinhanderDino CrisisBrian Lara/Shane Warne Cricket ‘99Need For Speed: High StakesThe Legend of DragoonAnd those are our picks for the best games on the original PlayStation.
