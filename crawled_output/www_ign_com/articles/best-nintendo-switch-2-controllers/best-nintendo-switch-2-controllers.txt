While the Joy-Con works fine for handheld gaming, the ergonomics aren’t great, which makes them uncomfortable over long sessions. I also don’t think they’re particularly great for games that demand precision, even when using the included grip attachment. Getting the right Switch 2 controller will do you big favors for performance and comfort, but which ones are worth considering in the early days of the new console? I already have answers for you.Since the Switch 2 doesn’t come with a distinct gamepad, the onus is on you to get a proper controller, and I’ve already tested some of the best options out there, including many of the ones we’ve recommended for the original Switch. Yes, if you have a controller you really like that you used on the Switch, you can use it with the Switch 2, but that comes with a few caveats and missing features. Luckily, a few Switch 2-specific controllers are already out there in this launch window that work like a dream, with top my recommendations here for the best Switch 2 controllers you can get right now.TL;DR: The Best Controllers for Switch 28Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller20See it at TargetSee it at Walmart7PowerA Advantage11See it at AmazonSee it at PowerAHori Horipad Turbo5See it at WalmartSee it at Best BuyGulikit KK3 Max5See it at Amazon8.8Nintendo Switch Pro Controller8See it at WalmartSee it at NintendoSee it at Target88BitDo Ultimate5See it at AmazonSee it at Best BuyPowerA Enhanced Wireless2See it at AmazonSee it at PowerAI’m pretty particular about my controllers, so every one I’ve used goes through a certain level of scrutiny – as you may have seen in my Switch 2 Pro Controller review, I take the time to consider every aspect of a controller (which extends to the many keyboards and mice I’ve also reviewed). Since some gamepads do things better than others or may emphasize different aspects, I go through why I made each pick to make sure you know what you’re getting so you’ll hopefully be set for the years to come with your Switch 2.1. Nintendo Switch 2 Pro ControllerBest Controller for Switch 28Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller20The official Switch 2 Pro Controller is a refined gamepad with every feature you need to make the most of the new system.See it at TargetSee it at WalmartProduct SpecificationsFeaturesHD Rumble 2, motion/gyro controls, built-in amiibo functionality, C button, programmable GL/GR buttons, 3.5mm audio jackBattery life~40 hoursWeight.85lbsPROSGreat battery lifeFantastic buttons and sticksSolid build qualityCONSHandles may be a bit small for bigger handsThe first-party Switch 2 Pro Controller is carefully designed, reliable, and packed with every feature you need from a gamepad, making it one of the easiest choices to recommend. In my Switch 2 Pro Controller review, I praised its great button feel and super-smooth analog sticks, going as far as saying they’re better than the DualShock for PS5 and the Xbox controller. While you’re not going to get analog trigger functions here, the triggers and bumpers are satisfying to the touch – but the real star here are the GL and GR back buttons. Back buttons have been on other aftermarket controllers in the past, but these are native to the Switch 2 and can easily be mapped to act as any other button on your controller. This comes in clutch for assigning face button actions to help keep your thumbs on the sticks at all times since GL and GR are super easy to press and never get in the way, The Switch 2 Pro Controller has a sleek matte black finish that feels nice in the hands and it has a certain density that gives it a strong build quality. The biggest concern I’d put out there is that the handles to hold the controller are a bit small, so those with bigger hands might struggle to find the right grip. Otherwise, it delivers everything you need, including the 3.5mm audio jack and the C button for GameChat. It’s $85 at normal price, but what you get in return is the best Switch 2 controller out right now.2. PowerA AdvantageBest Budget Controller for Switch 27PowerA Advantage11PowerA's Switch 2 controller is a wired solution, but has all the bells and whistles you need at a reasonable price.See it at AmazonSee it at PowerAProduct SpecificationsFeaturesHall Effect modules, mappable Advanced Gaming buttons, C Button and on-board audio controls, 3.5mm audio jackBattery lifeN/A, wiredWeight.47lbsPROSHall Effect sticks help against driftSuper lightweightGreat ergonomics and buttonsCONSNo gyroscope controls or HD rumblePowerA has been reliable for many years and proved to be great by putting out solid Switch controllers at budget-friendly prices. That trend continues with the Switch 2 and PowerA’s Advantage wired controller that we reviewed. This is a fully sized gamepad and may be preferable to the new Pro Controller if you need something heftier to hold onto – and it’s much lighter at the same time. Its sticks, buttons, and triggers are all on point in terms of responsiveness and feel, and the D-pad stands out as a bit better than the Pro Controller. You still get the Switch 2’s new features like the C button, 3.5mm audio jack, and programmable back buttons as well. And its analog sticks are Hall Effect, meaning you likely won’t have to worry about stick drift.It comes with some caveats, though – you won’t get HD rumble or gyroscope motion controls, which is a bummer. But at just $40, I don’t mind a few compromises. There’s only a wired version for now (it thankfully comes with a long 10-foot USB-A cable), so if you absolutely need something wireless, I’d recommend either the Pro Controller or holding out for when PowerA inevitably puts out its own. And if its previous-gen wireless gamepad is anything to go by, it’ll also be one of my go-to recommendations.3. Horipad TurboBest Wired Controller for Switch 2Hori Horipad Turbo5The new wired Horipad Turbo has improvements over its predecessor and the features you want from a proper Switch 2 controller.See it at WalmartSee it at Best BuyProduct SpecificationsFeaturesTurbo (rapid input) functions, C button, programmable rear buttonsBattery lifeN/A, wiredWeight.3lbsPROSTurbo settings can be advantageousGreat D-padNice analog sticksCONSNo gyroscope controls or 3.5mm audio jackThe new HoriPad Turbo is nearly identical to the previous model that Hori put out for the original Switch, which means it’s still a solid option among Switch 2 controllers. It’s ergonomically sound – closer to an Xbox controller – and it has smooth analog sticks and all-around good button feel. Its star feature is turbo mode, which you can set to send rapid inputs at 5, 10, or 20 button presses per second, which is super easy to program on the controller itself – whether or not that comes in handy will depend on what you play. Hori also has its own mappable back buttons, and as mentioned above, they can make a world of difference in games with complex control schemes, letting you map any other button for easier access.Like other budget-level wired Switch gamepads, you won’t get gyroscope motion controls, but it’s a little disappointing to see that it doesn’t include the 3.5mm audio jack that’s now standard for Switch 2 controllers. However, the HoriPad Turbo is still a great value at $40 for a wired controller that has nearly everything you want from one and more.4. Gulikit KK3 MaxBest Controller from Switch 1Gulikit KK3 Max5The Gulikit KK3 Max controller is hard to beat, for Switch or otherwise, and it's a great value considering its performance and features.See it at AmazonProduct SpecificationsFeaturesHall Effect joysticks and triggers, Maglev vibration motor, detachable back paddles, adjustable D-pad, 6-Axis gyro, NFC-amiiboBattery life15-28 hours, depending on modeWeight1.3lbsPROSIncredible customizationSmooth Hall Effect sticksAll-around premium feelCONSSwitch 1 controller limitationsThe Gulikit KK3 Max was hands down my favorite controller for Switch 1 (and one of my top picks for PC gamepads, too), and there’s plenty of reason to go with it for the Switch 2. It has the feel of a premium controller with substantial handles that have a nice textured grip. Its Hall Effect sticks have staved off stick drift and have been some of the smoothest analog sticks I’ve used across the board. It’s also very versatile since it has analog triggers for those who want to use it on PC and a 2.4GHz dongle for easy and responsive connectivity.It comes with tools that make it super simple to swap out parts and well-made aluminum back paddles that you can attach if you want. Since they’re technically paddles, they protrude from the handles, but pressing them feels more tuned for competitive play, which is to say they’re fantastic – and you can have up to four paddles total. It’s a little complicated to customize its various features, like the neat RGB lighting around the sticks, since all of it is done through various onboard controller inputs; although once you’re set, you’ll be good to go. While it carries some of the limitations of using a Switch 1 controller on Switch 2 like not being able to wake up the console and the lack of the C button for quick GameChat access, there’s little to complain about and a whole lot to praise. I know $80 is still a lot to ask for, but if you can catch the KK3 Max on sale, you’d get a great value for one of my favorite controllers in recent memory.5. Nintendo Switch Pro ControllerBest Mid-Range Controller from Switch 18.8Nintendo Switch Pro Controller8If you don't already have one, the original Switch Pro Controller still stands as one of the best feeling gamepads out there.See it at WalmartSee it at NintendoSee it at TargetProduct SpecificationsFeaturesGyro/motion controls, HD rumble, built-in amiibo functionalityBattery life~40 hoursWeight.54lbsPROSFantastic built qualityGreat buttons and analog sticksTop-tier battery lifeCONSLackluster D-padThe good ol’ reliable Pro Controller is still a stellar choice when it comes to Switch 2 gamepads. Many of my favorite things about the new Pro Controller were brought over from this one, like the fantastic analog sticks (aside from stick drift concerns), swift and tactile triggers and buttons, and great 40-hour battery life. I actually prefer the grip style of this original version than the new one, too – but the D-pad is the one area it needed to improve (and it did in the new model) since it’s not as precise as you’d want for games like 2D platformers.If you already have one, it’s a hard ask to have you make the jump to a Switch 2 controller at the moment unless you don’t mind the price tag of the Switch 2 Pro Controller. So, sticking with what you have if it’s still working fine and you’re happy with it is a smart move. If you’re choosing between the two, you can get the original Switch Pro Controller for slightly cheaper at $70 (and even on sale for $60 or $50) and it wouldn’t be a bad choice if you don’t mind missing out on a few Switch 2-specific features. 6. 8BitDo UltimateBest Third-Party Controller from Switch 188BitDo Ultimate5With TMR parts and a great overall feel, 8BitDo continues to assert itself as a top controller maker, especially for the Switch.See it at AmazonSee it at Best BuyProduct SpecificationsFeaturesMultifunctional charging dock, Hall Effect sticks, back paddles, gryo/motion control, custom profile buttons, rumble vibrationBattery life22 hoursWeight.54lbsPROSConvenient charging dockHall Effect sticksNice programmable back buttonsCONSN/AWhen we first reviewed the 8BitDo Ultimate controller, we found it to be one of the Switch options that have a premium feel that matches the Switch Pro Controller. However, you get a slightly larger and better performing D-pad, Hall Effect sticks to mitigate drift, and the kind of responsive buttons that you'd expect from more expensive controllers. Using the 8BitDo Ultimate app, you can customize button mapping, including the two back buttons, the intricacies of the analog sticks, and the vibration levels of the rumble feature. A custom profile switch button allows you to store three profiles on the pad for convenient on-the-fly swapping.It has a decent 22-hour battery life, and it comes with a charging dock that makes it easy to keep it fully charged when you’re not playing. The dock also acts as a wireless connection and the included 2.4GHz dongle makes it a solid option on PC. There's even Bluetooth support to add to its versatility, and it stands as a great and cost-effect wireless option for Switch 2. It’s often on sale for $50 and the quality you get in return makes it a really good value.7. PowerA Enhanced WirelessBest Budget Controller from Switch 1PowerA Enhanced Wireless2PowerA nailed the fundamentals in this affordable build.See it at AmazonSee it at PowerAProduct SpecificationsFeaturesMappable Advanced Gaming buttons, Battery life30 hoursWeight.5lbPROSGreat value for wirelessSuper lightweightErgonomically solidCONSN/AI’ve kept around my PowerA Enhanced controller for my original Switch because it’s a simple and super lightweight gamepad that always seems to hold its charge over long periods. Even though the Gulikit KK3 Max is still my top dog, the simplicity and fantastic performance of PowerA’s wireless gamepad makes it an incredible value that’s often under $40 on sale.Of course, it doesn’t carry some of the new Switch 2 features but it does have programmable back buttons that are simple to map with its onboard controls. It does nail the fundamentals, too, with smooth analog sticks, solid buttons, and a full comfortable grip for long sessions. It’s a no-frills controller, but if you do want a bit of extra flair, it comes in a variety of special editions tied to some of Nintendo’s biggest franchises. Which Switch 2 Controller Will You Use?Sticking with the included Joy-Con 2 controllersI'll purchase the Nintendo Switch 2 Pro ControllerI'll get the Joy-Con 2 Charging GripI'll be racing with the Joy-Con 2 WheelI'll use the Nintendo GameCube ControllerI'll be using an older compatible Nintendo Switch ControllerSomething else entirely!AnswerSee ResultsFrequently Asked Questions – Switch 2 ControllersCan I use my Switch 1 controller on Switch 2?Yes, you can! As mentioned in many of the recommendations above, you’ll be missing out on a few Switch 2-exclusive features, however. Namely: the C button to quickly access GameChat and the 3.5mm audio jack to easily connect headphones or earbuds while playing. Several aftermarket Switch 1 controllers already came with programmable back buttons so you can still take advantage of them – the only thing is that you’ll have to map them through the controller’s onboard method rather than the Switch 2 menus like you would with the new Pro Controller’s GL and GR buttons. It’s worth mentioning that you also can’t turn on the Switch 2 with a Switch 1 controller, which some will find more inconvenient than others.Should I be worried about stick drift?If the controller doesn’t have Hall Effect or TMR analog sticks, it may be more susceptible to stick drift over time, which was an issue for some during the Switch 1 era (and PS5 users have experienced this on the DualSense as well). The parts of a traditional analog stick may wear out in a way that knocks them off its center, causing it to send errant inputs to the system even when idling. It’s impossible to tell if and when this might happen to your controller, unfortunately. The likes of Gulikit and 8BitDo use Hall Effect sticks, which are made with magnetic internals for less friction between parts and therefore less wear.What if I want to stick with my Joy-Con? How can I make them better?While I’m not a fan of the Joy-Con (or the new Joy-Con 2) on their own, there are ways you can make them better from an ergonomic perspective. Grip attachments from companies like DBrand and Genki give the Joy-Con a more robust handle to get them closer to a full-sized controller feel, and they work wonders for playing handheld. The packaged grip handle that comes with the Switch 2 is the simplest way to turn the Joy-Con into a manageable solution for playing docked. You can’t do anything to improve the analog sticks, of course, and while they’re fine for games that aren’t really about precision, their limited range of motion really holds them back in shooters or anything with camera controls.Will there be more options for wireless Switch 2 controllers?No doubt. We’re still in the early days of the new console and while there are plenty of cases, grip attachments, and portable chargers for the Switch 2 already, accessories that involve technical features like controllers and docks need more time to fully roll out. Third parties like PowerA and Hori already have wired solutions for now, but expect wireless versions from them and many of the other manufacturers that made Switch 1 controllers in the coming months.
