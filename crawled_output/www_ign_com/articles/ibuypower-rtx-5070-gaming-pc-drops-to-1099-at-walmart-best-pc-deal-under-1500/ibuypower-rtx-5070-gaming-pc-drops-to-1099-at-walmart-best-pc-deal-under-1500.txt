Walmart is offering the iBuypower Slate RTX 5070 gaming PC for just $1,099 after a $400 off instant discount. This PC is sold and shipped from Walmart direct and not a marketplace vendor. The RTX 5070 graphics card is an excellent choice for gaming at 1080p or 1440p.iBuypower Slate RTX 5070 Gaming PC for $1,099iBuypower Slate Intel Core i5-14400F RTX 5070 Gaming PC (16GB/1TB)5$1,499.00 save 27%$1,099.00 at WalmartThe iBuypower Slate gaming PC is equipped with an Intel Core i5-14400F processor, GeForce RTX 5070 graphics card, 16GB of DDR5-5200MHz RAM, and a 1TB M.2 SSD. The Intel Core i5-14400F is a 14th generation Raptor Lake Refresh model with a max turbo frequency of 4.7GHz and 10 cores. It's cooled by a 120mm tower heatsink and fan combo.The GeForce RTX 5070 GPU is an excellent choice for 1080p or 1440p gamingCompared to the previous generation GPUs, the RTX 5070 performs a bit better than the RTX 4070 Super. I wish there was a bigger generation improvement in raw performance, but the RTX 5070 is still a superior graphics card because it supports DLSS 4 and has 12GB of the newer GDDR7 VRAM on top of the slight performance improvement. You probably won't even find an RTX 4070 Super gaming PC for less than $1,100, either. The RTX 5070 is a popular GPU for 1080p or 1440 gaming. The next card up - the RTX 5070 Ti - is significantly more expensive and really for gamers who want high fps 1440p or 4K gaming. Anything less demanding and it's probably overkill.Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Review by Jacqueline Thomas"The Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 is complicated. It does what it says on the tin: play games at 1440p at a high frame rate. But the problem is that it doesn’t necessarily do that better than the RTX 4070 Super, or any other graphics card in this price range. It does add Multi Frame Generation, which is nice to have for anyone with a high-refresh monitor, but that alone isn’t worth the upgrade."Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.
