While the first-ever Iconic cards are, understandably, fetching sizeable fees, plenty of the other "Enchanted" cards are also reaching hundreds of dollars already, and are definitely worth chasing as well. Using data from our friends at TCGPlayer, here are the most expensive cards in the Fabled set of Disney Lorcana, and where to find them.Powerline - World's Greatest Rock Star (Enchanted) Disney LorcanaPowerline - World's Greatest Rock Star6EnchantedSee it at TCGPlayerKicking off with a card that many were excited for when Fabled was revealed, Powerline - World's Greatest Rock Star is sitting at around $172.Aside from the fact that he turns song cards into card draw and cheats out big cards, the artwork is awesome (and he’s the only Goofy Movie entrant on this list).Circle of Life (Enchanted)Disney LorcanaCircle of Life6EnchantedSee it at TCGPlayerSitting just above Powerline is the Enchanted version of Circle of Life, coming in at around $177.The artwork is gorgeous, you can bring back a discarded card, and I’m always happy to see anything from The Lion King. Which brings us nicely to…Scar - Finally King (Enchanted)Disney LorcanaScar - Finally King3EnchantedSee it at TCGPlayerSitting at around $205, Scar - Finally King’s Enchanted version has more amazing artwork showing the one-time ruler of Pride Rock chatting to a skull and smirking.He buffs allies, then turns that into card draw, which is basically what you’d expect from the self-centred brother of Mufasa.Winnie the Pooh - Hunny Wizard (Enchanted)Disney LorcanaWinnie the Pooh - Hunny Wizard2EnchantedSee it at TCGPlayerReprints are great ways to lower the cost of cards, but this Fabled version of Winnie the Pooh - Hunny Wizard is going for $220.And you know what? We get it. Look at him, all happy with his borderless treatment.Hades - Infernal Schemer (Enchanted)Disney LorcanaHades - Infernal Schemer3EnchantedSee it at TCGPlayerLaying my (Lorcana) cards on the table here, Hades - Infernal Schemer (Enchanted) might be my favorite card on this list.He’s another reprint, and looks incredible. His value is rising, too, with a market value of $250 but already selling for more than that.Lilo - Best Explorer Ever (Enchanted)Disney LorcanaLilo - Best Explorer Ever2EnchantedSee it at TCGPlayerThis adorable Lilo - Best Explorer Ever card isn’t a reprint, and grants Challenger to allies.
The standard artwork, with Stitch lurking in the background, is great, but this one makes him even harder to spot so that Lilo can be the clear focus in her spacesuit.The card is sitting at $255, marginally more than Hades, but it does seem to be dropping slightly.Belle - Accomplished Mystic (Enchanted)Disney LorcanaBelle - Accomplished Mystic2EnchantedSee it at TCGPlayerBelle - Accomplished Mystic marks the first of a quartet of ‘classic’ Disney characters that finish off this list, and she’s a reprint of a Super Rare that appeared in Ursula’s Return.She’s at the $315 mark right now, but has sold for under $300.Dumbo - Ninth Wonder of the Universe (Enchanted)Disney LorcanaDumbo - Ninth Wonder of the Universe4EnchantedSee it at TCGPlayerAnother new card, Dumbo - Ninth Wonder of the Universe is currently sitting at around $365 and selling for around that, too.He’s not only adorable in this picture, but he’s handy to have if you’re looking to rack up lore with his abilities.Minnie Mouse - Sweetheart Princess (Iconic)Disney LorcanaMinnie Mouse - Sweetheart Princess7IconicSee it at TCGPlayerSurprising no one, it's the new Iconic artwork that takes the top two spots of our list, starting with Minnie Mouse - Sweetheart Princess.She’ll set you back around $865 right now, but has sold for around $120 less than that. Will she climb further, or is that a sign of an imminent drop? We’ll know more in the coming days.Mickey Mouse - Brave Little Prince (Iconic)Disney LorcanaMickey Mouse - Brave Little Prince3IconicSee it at TCGPlayer“Oh boy!” - Mickey Mouse, upon seeing that his Mickey Mouse - Brave Little Prince (Iconic) card has a market value of over $1000, presumably.Mickey’s the most expensive card on this list by some distance, and will set you back $1,022. Still, he’s sold for just shy of $900, so there’s some wiggle room.Being one of the first iconic cards, and an absolutely beautiful looking one at that, I'm not surprised this is demanding a pretty penny right now. At the time of writing, it's the most valuable Disney Lorcana card ever.Where to Buy Disney Lorcana’s Fabled SetDisney Lorcana Fabled Booster Box1See it at AmazonDisney Lorcana Fabled Booster Pack1See it at AmazonDisney Lorcana Fabled Illumineer's Trove1See it at TCGPlayerDisney Lorcana Fabled Collection Starter Set1See it at TCGPlayerDisney Lorcana Amber and Sapphire Deck0See it at AmazonDisney Lorcana Emerald and Ruby Deck0See it at AmazonDisney Lorcana Elsa Gift Set1See it at TCGPlayerDisney Lorcana Accessories1See it at TCGPlayerThankfully, you don’t need to spend thousands of dollars to get started with Lorcana.The Fabled set sees the debut of a new Collection Starter Set to help you get started with collecting the heroes and villains of the Disney universe, and it includes 4 booster packs (a total of 48 cards), a portfolio binder for Mickey Mouse - Brave Little Tailor, a collector’s guide, and a Glimmer Foil variant of Tinker Bell - Giant Fairy.Then there are preconstructed decks, Illumineer’s Trove boxes, and boosters you can buy, too.Disney Lorcana - New Epic and Iconic Rarities ExplainedAs I mentioned, Disney Lorcana has expanded its rarity system in the new Fabled set with two new tiers: Epic and Iconic. Epic cards sit between Legendary and Enchanted, making them rarer than the former but easier to find than the latter. These are alternate versions of existing cards that reuse Standard artwork but get a premium treatment, including an "open air" frame, rainbow foiling, and glossy highlights.Iconic cards, meanwhile, now take the crown as Lorcana’s rarest chase cards. Only two appear per set, each featuring alternate full-card artwork that continues behind the text box, along with a raised 3D hot stamp effect and a shimmering custom lore star foil.How to Follow IGN Deals RecommendationsThe IGN Deals team has over 30 years of combined experience finding the best discounts and preorders available online.
