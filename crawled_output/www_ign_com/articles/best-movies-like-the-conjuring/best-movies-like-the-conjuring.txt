Created by Furious 7 director James Wan, who also co-created the long-running Saw franchise, The Conjuring started as a freaky dramatization of the real-life paranormal snoops, Ed and Lorraine Warren. From there, the movies began exploring the histories of its various demons (The Nun and The Nun 2) and/or cursed objects (Annabelle films).While we wait for the fourth main and "final" film of The Conjuring series, The Conjuring: Last Rites, to release in September, we've picked 13 movies that might get under your skin the same way The Conjuring does. Our list includes movies dealing with ghosts, devils, and all sorts of malevolent spirits for you to check out and get that all-important Conjuring hit.Naturally, you'll also want to check out all nine of the Conjuring franchise movies – The Conjuring, Annabelle, The Conjuring 2, Annabelle: Creation, The Nun, The Nun 2, The Curse of La Llorona, Annabelle Comes Home, and The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It. See our guide on where to watch the Conjuring movies for streaming details.So, without further ado, here are 13 movies like The Conjuring to scratch your horror itch. Insidious (2010)Image credit: FilmDistrictDirector: James Wan | Writer: Leigh Whannell | Stars: Patrick Wilson, Rose Byrne, Barbara Hershey | Release Date: September 14, 2010 | Review: IGN's Insidious reviewAs if creating the Saw saga wasn't enough, James Wan's Saw partner Leigh Whannell, created the Insidious franchise, which consists of five movies – Insidious, Insidious: Chapter 2, Insidious: Chapter 3, Insidious: The Last Key, and Insidious: The Red Door. Also starring The Conjuring's Patrick Wilson, along with Rose Byrne (before they pass the torch to a demonologist character played by Lin Shaye), the Insidious movies involve ghoulish ghost possession and all sorts of awful things that go bump in the night. And the first two are directed by James Wan!Insidious 6 was due to release in August 2025, but was been delayed a year to August 2026.InsidiousAlliance FilmsApr 1, 2011PG-13Where to WatchPowered byRent/BuyRent/BuyRent/BuyMoreThe Changeling (1980)Image credit: Pan-Canadian Film DistributorsDirector: Peter Medak | Writer: William Gray, Diana Maddox, Russell Hunter | Stars: George C.

Nelson | Release Date: June 4, 1982 | Review: IGN's Poltergeist reviewThe diabolical Poltergeist became to go-to terrorizer for all young kids of the era, and a terrific textbook treatment for how to present malevolent spirits. Evil trees, sinister clown dolls, and a handful of icky iconic moments make for one hell of a ride as the Freeling family gets more than they bargained for in their cookie-cutter planned California community.PoltergeistMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM)Jun 4, 1982PGWhere to WatchPowered byRent/BuyRent/BuyRent/BuyMoreOculus (2013)Image credit: Relativity MediaDirector: Mike Flanagan | Writer: Mike Flanagan, Jeff Howard | Stars: Karen Gillan, Brenton Thwaites, Katee Sackhoff | Release Date: September 8, 2013 | Review: IGN's Oculus reviewStarring Karen Gillan and Katee Sackhoff, Oculus is an underrated gem in the cursed object genre of horror films. Directed and co-written by Mike Flanagan, Oculus tells the tale of a brother and sister who, looking back at their childhood, become convinced that an antique mirror is responsible for the death and misfortune that they suffered.OculusRelativity MediaApr 11, 2014Where to WatchPowered byNot yet available for streaming.The Exorcism of Emily Rose (2005)Image credit: Screen Gems/SonyDirector: Scott Derrickson | Writer: Scott Derrickson, Paul Harris Boardman | Stars: Jennifer Carpenter, Laura Linney, Tom Wilkinson | Release Date: September 9, 2005 | Review: IGN's The Exorcism of Emily Rose reviewFeaturing a once-in-a-lifetime performance from a pre-Dexter Jennifer Carpenter, Scott Derrickson's The Exorcism of Emily Rose is unique in that it's half horror, half-legal drama. Loosely based on a true story, the movie follows a self-proclaimed agnostic (Laura Linney) who acts as defense counsel representing a parish priest (Tom Wilkinson), accused by the state of negligent homicide after he performed an exorcism.The Exorcism of Emily RoseScreen GemsSep 9, 2005PG-13Where to WatchPowered byRent/BuyRent/BuyRent/BuyMoreThe Exorcist (1973)Image credit: Warner Bros.Director: William Friedkin | Writer: William Peter Blatty | Stars: Ellen Burstyn, Max von Sydow, Linda Blair | Release Date: December 26, 1973 | Review: IGN's The Exorcist reviewNot much new needs to be written about The Exorcist as many still hail it as the best horror movie of all time. Its accolades, in fact, helped it become the first horror movie to ever be nominated for the Best Picture Oscar. The film is a must for horror buffs and since that's kind of a given we'll also use this space to recommend 1990's The Exorcist 3 (skip the direct sequel, this one brings back the original's director/writer team). It's got The Changeling's George C. Scott, a scene-stealing performance by Brad Dourif, and one of the best jump scares of all time. A direct sequel, The Exorcist: Believer, was released in 2023, but you can safely skip it.The ExorcistWarner Bros.

Starring James Brolin and Margot Kidder as a young couple moving into a home haunted by really nasty supernatural forces, The Amityville Horror is a ghost flick not to be missed.The Amityville Horror CollectionMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM)Apr 5, 2005RWhere to WatchPowered byNot yet available for streaming.The Haunting in Connecticut (2009)Image credit: Lionsgate FilmsDirector: Peter Cornwell | Writer: Adam Simon, Tim Metcalfe | Stars: Virginia Madsen, Kyle Gallner, Martin Donovan | Release Date: March 27, 2009 | Review: IGN's The Haunting in Connecticut reviewAnother "get the hell out of there!" movie, also allegedly based on a real life family, is The Haunting in Connecticut. The film follows the fictional Campbells as they move into a house to mitigate the strains of travel on their cancer-stricken son. They're soon brutalized by violent spirits, creating a perfect blend of thrills and chills.The Haunting in ConnecticutLionsgateMar 27, 2009Where to WatchPowered byRent/BuyRent/BuyRent/BuyMoreSinister (2012)Image credit: Lionsgate/Summit EntertainmentDirector: Scott Derrickson | Writer: Scott Derrickson, C. Robert Cargill | Stars: Ethan Hawke, Juliet Rylance, Fred Thompson | Release Date: March 11, 2012 | Review: IGN's Sinister reviewA film that should have spawned way more sequels than it got was Scott Derrickson's Sinister, starring Ethan Hawke as a struggling true-crime writer. He discovers a pretty wicked demon hiding inside home movies that wipes out entire families in one fell swoop. It's one of the freakiest films of the last decade. Sadly, Sinister 2 couldn't give the story a proper follow-up.SinisterAutomatik EntertainmentOct 12, 2012RWhere to WatchPowered byRent/BuyRent/BuyRent/BuyMoreThe Others (2001)Image credit: Dimension FIlmsDirector: Alejandro Amenábar | Writer: Alejandro Amenábar | Stars: Nicole Kidman, Fionnula Flanagan, Christopher Eccleston | Release Date: August 10, 2001 | Review: IGN's The Others reviewNicole Kidman headlined this gothic ghost story, which takes place in post-World War 2 1940s England and showcases a family tormented by supernatural goings-on in their home, primarily the "others," which seem to be an entirely different family walking the halls. The Others is a dreamy, twisty chiller that is definitely worth a late-night watch.The OthersMiramaxAug 10, 2001PG-13Where to WatchPowered byRent/BuyRent/BuyRent/BuyMoreThe Rite (2011)Image credit: Warner Bros. PicturesDirector: Mikael Håfström | Writer: Michael Petroni | Stars: Anthony Hopkins, Colin O'Donoghue, Alice Braga | Release Date: January 26, 2011 | Review: IGN's The Rite reviewLike The Conjuring, The Rite, starring Anthony Hopkins, is based on supposed actual events, this time ones witnessed by American exorcist-in-training Father Gary Thomas, who traveled to Rome to be trained. This is perfectly patient, atmospheric horror from 1408's Mikael Håfström and co-starring Once Upon a Time's Colin O'Donoghue.The RiteContrafilmJan 28, 2011PG-13Where to WatchPowered byRent/BuyRent/BuyRent/BuyMoreThe Orphanage (2007)Image credit: Warner Bros. PicturesDirector: J.A. Bayona | Writer: Sergio G. Sánchez | Stars: Belén Rueda, Fernando Cayo, Roger Príncep | Release Date: May 20, 2007 | Review: IGN's The Orphanage reviewThis stunning achievement in gothic horror hails from J. A. Bayona (Penny Dreadful, The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power), capturing the feel of 1970s Spanish cinema with the story of a woman who returns to an orphanage as an adult, with plans of turning it into a home for disabled children. But once her adopted son goes missing, she uncovers a fiendish ghost story happening underneath everything. J. A. Bayona's good friend Guillermo del Toro helped produce The Orphanage, getting its initial budget doubled.The OrphanagePicturehouseDec 28, 2007Where to WatchPowered byRentRentRentMoreThe Frighteners (1996)Image credit: Universal PicturesDirector: Peter Jackson | Writer: Fran Walsh, Peter Jackson | Stars: Michael J. Fox, Trini Alvarado, Peter Dobson | Release Date: July 19, 1996 | Review: IGN's The Frighteners review Lightening the mood here slightly, though still delivering a rather vicious story, is Peter Jackson's The Frighteners, which will have you both laughing and jumping alternately. Michael J. Fox stars as a con man who uses his ability to see and befriend ghosts to be his town's ghost-buster. Though his gifts soon reveal an actual killer spirit taking lives and from there it all becomes a rollicking, devilish adventure. Jake Busey, The Re-Animator's Jeffrey Combs, and scream queen Dee Wallace Stone co-star.The FrightenersUniversal PicturesJul 19, 1996RWhere to WatchPowered byRent/BuyRent/BuyRent/BuyMoreWhat is the best movie like The Conjuring?The FrightenersThe OthersThe ExorcistThe Exorcism of Emily RosePoltergeistThe OrphanageThe RiteSinisterInsidiousThe Haunting in ConnecticutThe Amityville Horror (1979)OculusThe ChangelingSomething else (let us know in the comments)AnswerSee ResultsAnd that's our pick of the best movies like The Conjuring.
