She also goes up against Sylux, another bounty hunter who isn’t happy with the Galactic Federation, or Samus. The game is now available to preorder in physical and digital editions (see it at Amazon). You can also preorder some awesome looking amiibo to go along with it.

Metroid Prime 4: Beyond amiibo. There’s Samus solo, aiming her blaster arm. There’s Samus on the extremely cool Vi-O-La motorcycle you get to ride in the game. And there’s the villainous Sylux. Nintendo hasn’t announced what in-game functionality scanning the amiibo will offer, but they’re sure to do something.Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Switch 2 Upgrade PackGet it at eShop (digital) - $9.99Let’s say you buy the game for the original Switch, and then you get a Switch 2 later. In that case, you can purchase the upgrade pack for $9.99 on the Nintendo eShop. This turns a standard Switch version (even a physical copy) into the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition of the game.The benefits of the upgrade include enhanced resolution, frame rate, and load times, plus the ability to aim by using a Joy-Con 2 controller as a mouse. Here’s Nintendo’s official description of the specifics of the upgrade:“Two display modes let you choose how to experience the adventure. Enjoy more detail in Quality Mode, which runs at 60 frames per second in 4k while docked and in 1080p while in handheld, or prioritize super-smooth action with a higher frame rate in Performance Mode, which runs at 120 frames per second in 1080p while docked and 720p in while in handheld. Both choices are HDR compatible.”Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Preorder Bonus?At the time of this writing, there are no preorder bonuses for buying the game. If that changes, I’ll update this section.What Is Metroid Prime 4: Beyond?Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is a long-in-the-works sequel to the 2007 Wii game Metroid Prime 3: Corruption. It’s had something of a troubled development cycle; after being announced at E3 2017, Nintendo announced in 2019 that development was being restarted. But here it is, six years later, finally coming out.This game puts you in the boots of the bounty hunter Samus and sends you to planet Viewros. There, you’re equipped with a very cool-looking motorcycle called Vi-O-La that lets you zip around large areas quickly. You can jump off ramps and fight aliens while riding, skidding into them as a form of attack. As with previous Metroid Prime games, exploration plays a big role. You can scan the alien flora and fauna to find out more about them. You also gain psychic abilities. If you buy the Switch 2 version, you get improved graphics and load times. You can also use the Joy-Con 2 controller as a mouse for aiming, which may offer more precision than the sticks.You can find out more in our Metroid Prime 4: Beyond hands-on preview.Other Preorder Guides007 First Light Preorder Guide Battlefield 6 Preorder Guide Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Preorder Guide Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Mirror Edition Preorder Guide Dragon Quest I and II HD-2D Remake Preorder Guide Dragon Quest VII Reimagined Preorder Guide Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade (Switch, Xbox) Preorder Guide Ghost of Yotei Preorder Guide Hades 2 Preorder Guide Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment Preorder Guide Kirby Air Riders Preorder Guide Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Preorder Guide Octopath Traveler 0 Preorder Guide Pokemon Legends Z-A Preorder Guide Silent Hill f Preorder Guide Super Mario Galaxy 1+2 Preorder Guide Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter Preorder Guide How to Follow IGN Deals RecommendationsThe IGN Deals team has over 30 years of combined experience finding the best discounts and preorders available online.
