For individual boxes, Walmart, which were previously selling some of these Pokémon Elite Trainer Boxes for over $110, are now listing White Flare ETBs $77.88 and Black Bolt ETBs for $79.88, respectively. If you’ve been aiming to pull some of the most valuable cards in Black Bolt or the highest-value chase cards in White Flare, this is the best opportunity currently available.White Flare Elite Trainer Box - SV: White Flare (WHT)0$77.88 at Walmart$80.89 at TCGplayer$104.49 save 14%$89.43 at AmazonBlack Bolt Elite Trainer Box - SV: Black Bolt (BLK)0$114.13 save 30%$79.88 at Walmart$88.88 at TCGplayer$95.49 save 6%$89.87 at Amazon(2-Pack) White Flare Elite Trainer Box - SV: White Flare (WHT)0$163.84 at Walmart(6-Pack)Black Bolt Elite Trainer Box - SV: Black Bolt (BLK)0$539.28 at WalmartAt Amazon, Pokémon TCG White Flare ETBs, previously listed for $104.49, are now as low as $89.43 on Amazon. To that extent, the Pokémon TCG’s Black Bolt ETB has had price drops on certain listings too, going from $95.49 to $89.87. TCGplayer, whose listings usually fluctuate in price more rapidly, have listings around the same price tag — with a White Flare ETB going for $80.89 when shipping is taken into account. Meanwhile, the cheapest Black Bolt ETB listing is now going for $88.88.Yes, these are still almost twice the MSRP of $49.99, the high demand vs short supply has usually resulted in marked prices going past $100 — making this a good deal by comparison. You can still check other retailers like Best Buy, which are the main retailers we’ve seen sticking to the $49.99 price tag, but any stock usually goes within a matter of minutes due to scalpers and the auto-buying bots at their disposal. (2-Pack) White Flare Elite Trainer Box - SV: White Flare (WHT)0$163.84 at Walmart(6-Pack)Black Bolt Elite Trainer Box - SV: Black Bolt (BLK)0$539.28 at WalmartMeanwhile, if you’re the type of Pokémon card collector who likes to buy as many Elite Trainer Boxes as possible, you have extra money to spend, or if TCGplayer or Walmart run out of individual stock, the latter still has multi-unit SKUs where you’re paying less for each. Walmart’s two-pack of White Flare ETBs is selling for $163.84, working out at $81.92 per unit. Meanwhile, the megastore still has Black Bolt ETB multi-packs of up to six boxes for $539.28 — working out at $89.88 each. Since Walmart’s prices for individual ETBs are even lower than they’ve ever been on Amazon, according to price tracker CamelCamelCamel, we definitely don’t expect availability to last for long.
