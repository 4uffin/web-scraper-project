Whether you're a competitive player, a casual collector, or someone who's just dropped way too much money on framed booster art, this year's TCG lineup is going all in with new mechanics, nostalgic reprints, and plenty of chances to chase that cardboard high.Pokémon TCG: 2025 Release Calendar - At a GlancePrismatic Evolutions: Jan. 17, 2025 (Out Now)Journey Together: Mar. 28, 2025 (Out Now)Destined Rivals: May 30, 2025 (Out Now)Black Bolt and White Flare: Jul. 18, 2025 (Out Now)Mega Evolution: Sep. 26, 2025Phantasmal Flames: Nov. 14, 2025Deal Alert: Prices Slashed on Black Bolt & White Flare SetsPokemon TCG Scarlet & Violet 10.5 Black Bolt Booster Bundle Set8$58.95 save 17%$48.90 at Amazon$47.85 at Walmart$40.00 at TCGPlayerRight now, at Amazon, the Black Bolt Booster Bundle is available for $48.90, "down" from its Amazon list price of $58.95, while the White Flare Booster Bundle has dropped to $45.01, a notable "discount" from $59.95.Each bundle includes six booster packs from its respective expansion, with the chance to pull cards like Zekrom ex among Black Bolt’s most valuable cards, or Reshiram ex in as one of White Flare’s most high-priced chase cards, plus the exclusive Black White Rare Victini that appears across both sets.Pokemon TCG Scarlet & Violet 10.5 White Flare Booster Bundle Set6$59.95 save 25%$45.01 at Amazon$48.87 at Walmart$47.95 at TCGPlayerOf course, the official MSRP for these bundles is only $26.94, though finding them at that price is nearly impossible now that they’ve officially hit shelves. Best Buy is technically the only retailer still listing at MSRP, but availability has been restricted to in-store purchases and tends to vanish quickly.Cheapest at TCGPlayerWhite Flare Elite Trainer Box3$104.49 save 11%$92.94 at Amazon$75.00 at TCGPlayerCheapest at TCGPlayerBlack Bolt Elite Trainer Box1$92.94 at Amazon$88.00 at TCGPlayerCheapest at TCGPlayerWhite Flare Binder Collection1$52.99 save 9%$47.99 at Amazon$48.90 at TCGPlayerCheapest at AmazonBlack Bolt Binder Collection2$67.99 save 30%$47.77 at Amazon$49.50 at TCGPlayerCheapest at TCGPlayerUnova Poster Collection1$39.98 at Amazon$29.02 at TCGPlayerCheapest at TCGPlayerUnova Mini Tin1$19.99 at Amazon$19.95 at TCGPlayerMega Evolution - Sept. 26, 2025Mega Evolution - Credit: The Pokémon CompanyJust when you thought the Pokémon TCG had enough going on with Destined Rivals and Black Bolt and White Flare, in comes a brand new series altogether with the Mega Evolution sets. Announced at Japan's Championship tournament, the two new sets featuring Mega Lucario ex and Mega Gardevoir ex mark the popular trading card game stepping away from its Scarlet and Violet era.Where to Preorder Mega EvolutionMega Evolution Elite Trainer Box [Mega Lucario] - ME01: Mega Evolution (MEG)4See it at TCGPlayerMega Evolution Elite Trainer Box [Mega Gardevoir] - ME01: Mega Evolution (MEG)1See it at TCGPlayerSee it at Amazonx10 Mega Evolution Elite Trainer Box Case - ME01: Mega Evolution (MEG)0See it at TCGPlayerx10 Mega Evolution Build & Battle Box Display - ME01: Mega Evolution (MEG)0See it at TCGPlayerMega Evolution Booster Box - ME01: Mega Evolution (MEG)1See it at TCGPlayerSee it at AmazonMega Evolution Booster Bundle - ME01: Mega Evolution (MEG)1See it at TCGPlayerMega Evolution 3 Pack Blister [Psyduck] - ME01: Mega Evolution (MEG)0See it at TCGPlayerMega Evolution 3 Pack Blister [Golduck] - ME01: Mega Evolution (MEG)0See it at TCGPlayerMega Evolution Sleeved Booster Pack - ME01: Mega Evolution (MEG)2See it at TCGPlayerMega Evolution Sleeved Booster Pack Art Bundle [Set of 4] - ME01: Mega Evolution (MEG)2See it at TCGPlayerMega Evolution Build & Battle Box - ME01: Mega Evolution (MEG)2See it at TCGPlayerSee it at WalmartMega Heroes Mini Tin9See it at TCGPlayerSee it at Best BuySee it at WalmartMega Evolution will release on August 1, 2025, in Japan, and September 26 in English markets (with more preorders also supposedly taking place on September 13). Finding sealed products like these at a fair price is already a challenge. Some stores are holding MSRP, others are inflating prices, and secondary marketplaces have their own dynamics to keep in mind, too. But the gist is: collectors who must have the ETB, Best Buy and Walmart are worth constant refreshing. If reliability matters more, TCGplayer is the most straightforward (though slighty more costly) option.While we can maybe expect products from this set to be joining Pokémon TCG deals further down the line, huge initial demand will definitely see certain cards become price juggernauts among upcoming crashers and climbers.It’s already shaping up to be a huge year, so here’s everything from the rest of the Pokémon TCG releases in 2025. And yes, IGN will be tracking all the preorder and buy links, both here and on socials at @IGNDeals.Mega Evolution: Phantasmal Flames - Nov. 14, 2025Mega Evolution: Phantasmal Flames - Credit: The Pokemon CompanyWith the Pokémon Center listings going live for preorder at any moment, it's only a matter of time until the first expansion for the new era of Pokémon TCG, Mega Evolution: Phantasmal Flames, comes pouring down to other retailers. First up will be Best Buy, normally around 24 hours after the Pokémon Center launch, followed by Target then secondary market and small seller allocations being available on TCGPlayer. Amazon and Walmart have been known to stock Pokémon TCG preorders in the past, but it's not always a guarantee.Phantasmal Flames Booster Box5See it at Best BuySee it at TargetSee it at TCGPlayerPhantasmal Flames Elite Trainer Box5See it at Best BuySee it at TargetSee it at TCGPlayerMega Charizard X ex Ultra-Premium Collection6See it at Best BuySee it at TargetSee it at TCGPlayerPhantasmal Flames 3 Pack Blister Weavile0See it at Best BuySee it at TargetSee it at TCGPlayerPhantasmal Flames 3 Pack Blister Sneasel0See it at Best BuySee it at TargetSee it at TCGPlayerPhantasmal Flames Booster Pack0See it at Best BuySee it at TargetSee it at TCGPlayerPhantasmal Flames drops on November 14, with prerelease events running the week before, and the big headline is Mega Charizard X ex returning in full force. What makes this set even more exciting is its size , about 90 cards before secret rares, which makes it the smallest English set in nearly a decade. For collectors like me, that usually means a much more manageable chase, while still packing in plenty of heavy hitters for players.The product lineup looks pretty stacked too. We’ll be getting the usual booster packs and booster box (36 packs), a 9-pack Elite Trainer Box featuring a shiny new Charcadet promo, and an Ultra-Premium Collection built around Mega Charizard X ex. On top of that, two theme decks for Mega Gengar ex and Mega Diancie ex are arriving a few weeks early on October 24, which is a fun way to get a taste of the set before launch. If you’re like me and love cracking packs, the booster box is the way to go, but the UPC is already looking like the big collector piece this time around.What ties it all together is the Japanese set Inferno X, which hit shelves there in late September. That set had only 80 cards, and once you add in the Mega Gengar and Mega Diancie decks, you basically get the full Phantasmal Flames lineup. We’ve already seen some killer reveals, including the Mega Charizard X ex secret rare previewed at Worlds, so I’m fully expecting that to be the chase card when this launches. Between the smaller set size, Charizard hype, and some solid gameplay cards, I think this one’s going to fly off shelves and I’m definitely locking in my preorder.Pokémon TCG 2025 Holiday Calendar - Released Aug. 22, 2025Pokémon TCG: Holiday Calendar (2025)11$79.99 save 15%$67.94 at Amazon$79.99 save 19%$64.99 at WalmartThe Pokémon Company started releasing annual holiday calendars back in 2022, inspired by the Pokémon Countdown Calendar from 2008. These products are surprisingly good value in the current TCG market, as well as for casual fans of the series in other forms. You can see the listing here at Amazon or scroll on for more details.The 2025 Pokémon Holiday Calendar released on August 22 and initially retailed for $49.99 at Target before quicklly selling out.

We recently previewed the new sets that brought 156 Unova Illustration cards to Pokémon TCG, and it's pretty good!If you haven't secured your boosters for Black Bolt and White Flare sealed products, feel free to try your luck at launch at your local brick and mortar or online, or even at Amazon right now.Alternatively, TCGPlayer pricing for presale sealed product is crashing, so I reckon we're seeing the usual price crash post-launch coming earlier.Cheapest at TCGPlayerWhite Flare Elite Trainer Box3$104.49 save 11%$92.94 at Amazon$75.00 at TCGPlayerCheapest at TCGPlayerBlack Bolt Elite Trainer Box1$92.94 at Amazon$88.00 at TCGPlayerCheapest at TCGPlayerWhite Flare Binder Collection1$52.99 save 9%$47.99 at Amazon$48.90 at TCGPlayerCheapest at AmazonBlack Bolt Binder Collection2$67.99 save 30%$47.77 at Amazon$49.50 at TCGPlayerCheapest at TCGPlayerUnova Poster Collection1$39.98 at Amazon$29.02 at TCGPlayerCheapest at TCGPlayerUnova Mini Tin1$19.99 at Amazon$19.95 at TCGPlayerWhat do I think of the set? I think it's great and possibly the best opportunity to pull Illustration Rares in the Scarlet and Violet era, it's ending on a high note. Personally I'm not a fan of stuffing the set with Pokéball and Masterball rares, but in terms of quality and presentation they look cool. It would be grand to see Mega Evolution double down on the dual format and loads of Illustration Rares, but this is an encouraging sneek peek into what's next for Pokémon TCG.Zekrom ex - 172/086 - SV: Black Bolt (BLK)10$472.94 at TCG PlayerVictini - 171/086 - SV: Black Bolt (BLK)4$451.72 at TCG PlayerSeismitoad - 105/086 - SV: Black Bolt (BLK)2$157.09 at TCG PlayerGenesect ex - 067/086 - SV: Black Bolt (BLK)3$6.56 at TCG PlayerZekrom ex - 166/086 - SV: Black Bolt (BLK)11$227.27 at TCG PlayerGenesect ex - 161/086 - SV: Black Bolt (BLK)5$12.71 at TCG PlayerGenesect ex - 169/086 - SV: Black Bolt (BLK)2$71.89 at TCG PlayerAir Balloon - SV: Black Bolt (BLK)3$1.41 at TCG PlayerZekrom ex - 034/086 - SV: Black Bolt (BLK)2$2.62 at TCG PlayerN's Plan - 170/086 - SV: Black Bolt (BLK)2$75.28 at TCG PlayerBlack Bolt and White Flare focus on the 156 Pokémon originally discovered in the Unova region.

This set brings back Trainer’s Pokémon, reintroduces Team Rocket for another round of villainous fun, and includes some of the best card art we’ve seen in ages. Destined Rivals top chase card prices are also finally stabilizing, making it a great time to snap some up. Team Rocket's Mewtwo ex SIR has been going for anything over $450 since release, but is starting to settle on a more respectable $370.

Some cards were doubling in price overnight and it was tough to tell what was hype and what would hold. Now prices feel a lot more stable. Some have dipped. Some Destined Rivals bangers are just cruising right at market. It feels like we’re finally seeing what these cards are actually worth.Team Rocket's Mewtwo ex - 231/18222$375.39 save -4%$391.97 at TCG PlayerTeam Rocket’s Tyranitar (Prerelease Staff)21$107.86 save 35%$70.53 at TCG PlayerCynthia’s Garchomp ex (232/182)21$201.80 save 3%$195.23 at TCG PlayerTeam Rocket’s Moltres ex (229/182)17$130.96 save -1%$132.32 at TCG PlayerMisty’s Gyarados (Prerelease Staff)11$66.58 save 5%$63.37 at TCG PlayerEthan’s Ho-Oh ex (230/182)15$141.91 save 1%$141.02 at TCG PlayerTeam Rocket’s Mewtwo ex (240/182)13$68.30 save -4%$70.98 at TCG PlayerEthan’s Typhlosion (Prerelease Staff)11$66.78 save -5%$70.03 at TCG PlayerTeam Rocket’s Nidoking ex (233/182)10$97.29 save -6%$103.51 at TCG PlayerTeam Rocket’s Crobat ex (234/182)12$64.98 save 5%$61.67 at TCG PlayerAbove are the ten most expensive cards in the set right now. A couple of them are legit strong in decks. A few are pure collector bait. Team Rocket's Mewtwo ex was the hottest card in the set for a while and it’s still holding close to market. The artwork is what does it for me. Mewtwo looks like it's about to explode, floating in this dim lab setting with everything glowing around it. The ability makes it tough to use unless you’re running a full Rocket build, but once it's active, Erasure Ball gives you some serious power. Definitely still a top-tier pull even with the market calming down.What Cards Are Hot Right Now?14% climb from early JulyCharizard ex - 199/1657$179.25 save -17%$210.00 at TCGplayer9% climb from early JulyBlastoise ex - 200/1654$60.66 save -40%$84.99 at TCGplayer27% climb from early JulyVenusaur ex - 198/1657$51.26 save -37%$69.99 at TCGplayer23% climb from early JulyZapdos ex - 202/1657$47.65 save -30%$61.99 at TCGplayer35% climb from early JulyAlakazam ex - 201/1657$35.74 save -26%$44.98 at TCGplayer14% drop from late May 24Charmander - 168/1653$51.82 save 14%$44.44 at TCGplayer7% drop from late May 24Squirtle - 170/1653$47.21 save 7%$43.80 at TCGplayer18% drop from late May 24Bulbasaur - 166/1656$39.11 save 18%$32.20 at TCGplayer14% drop from late May 24Charmeleon - 169/1655$35.43 save 14%$30.54 at TCGplayer7% drop from late May 24Wartortle - 171/1657$31.37 save 7%$29.10 at TCGplayerScarlet and Violet 151 card prices continue to shift, with Charizard ex, Blastoise ex, and Venusaur ex SIRs climbing steadily thanks to standout artwork, competitive playability, and high collector demand. Charizard has jumped to $210, Blastoise is up 28% to $84.99, and Venusaur is up 27% to $69.99. Zapdos ex and Alakazam ex are also on the rise, with Alakazam seeing the biggest gain of 35% to $44.98. On the other hand, prices for Kanto starter Illustration Rares like Charmander, Bulbasaur, and Squirtle have dipped as more product floods the market. Charmander is down 14% to $44.44, Bulbasaur is down 18% to $32.20, and middle evolutions like Charmeleon and Wartortle are following the same trend. While the final evolutions remain the most sought-after, now is a good time to pick up the earlier stages at a more reasonable price.Journey Together - Released Mar. 28 2025Pokemon Trading Card Game: Scarlet and Violet Journey Together Booster Sleeves22See it at Best BuySee it at GameStopPokemon Trading Card Game: Scarlet and Violet Journey Together Build and Battle Box18See it at GameStopPokemon Trading Card Game: Scarlet and Violet Journey Together Booster Bundle13See it at AmazonSee it at GameStopPokemon Trading Card Game: Scarlet and Violet Journey Together Booster Box 36 Count13See it at Best BuySee it at GameStopPokemon Trading Card Game: Scarlet and Violet Journey Together Elite Trainer Box17See it at AmazonSee it at GameStopPokemon Trading Card Game: Scarlet and Violet Journey Together Three Booster Blister10See it at Amazon$14.99 See it at GameStopIt’s about time we got a set like this.
