Whether they’re exclusively developed for the Switch or ported over from other platforms, these upcoming Switch games will likely wrap up the Switch era while also being compatible with the Switch 2. In the second half of 2025, we'll hopefully be getting our hands on well-known in-development titles as well as a host of new games announced at the most recent Nintendo Direct. Here are all of the new Switch games we can look forward to this year. If you managed to secure a Switch 2, you might be more interested in our list of Switch 2 games.All Upcoming Switch Games With Release DatesThe Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter (September 19, 2025) The highly-anticipated Trails in the Sky remake officially has a release date. Well, at least the first chapter. The RPG from Nihon Falcon kicked off the Trails sub-series back in 2004, and the remake introduces quality of life improvements using the same engine as Trails of Daybreak. Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree (September 19, 2025) The evil Magatsu has thrown the kingdom into turmoil. You play as Towa, who must seek Guardian companions and push back Magatsu’s influence in this roguelite we called "twin-stick Hades" in our hands-on preview. DreamWorks Gabby's Dollhouse: Ready to Party (September 19, 2025) Gabby’s Dollhouse has been a hit with the kids, having just wrapped up its 11th season from DreamWorks Animation. The game adaptation has you working with Gabby and friends from across magical worlds to prep the best party ever. Folly Of The Wizards (September 19, 2025) There’s never enough roguelikes, in my opinion. Join a wacky wizard cult and explore procedurally generated dungeons in this sidescroller with a comedic edge. Sonic Racing: Crossworlds (September 25, 2025) Sonic's back, and he's bringing some friends along for the ride. Sonic Racing: Crossworlds seems to be an ultimate crossover game, blending chaotic kart racing mechanics with a pretty insane slate of characters. Look forward to vehicle customization and a variety of environments across each track (and universe). Out September 25Sonic Racing: Crossworlds1See it at AmazonAgatha Christie - Death on the Nile (September 25, 2025) The Agatha Christie adventure game series goes all the way back to 2005. This new release adapts, as you can imagine, Death on the Nile, a detective novel the author originally published in 1937. NBA Bounce (September 26, 2025) A slightly cuter alternative to the annual 2K releases, NBA Bounce lets you join one of 30 NBA teams and work your way up from rookie to legend on the court. Pac-Man World 2 Re-Pac (September 26, 2025) Coming off the heels of Shadow Labyrinth's edgier take on the Pac-Man franchise, we're going back to basics. Pac-Man World 2: Re-Pac introduces enhanced graphics, expanded levels, and tons of quality of life improvements to the action platformer that originally released in 2002. Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles (September 30, 2025)The next Final Fantasy (adjacent) game to arrive on Switch, Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles tells the story of a noble boy and his childhood friend who become entwined in the series' classic civil conflict: The War of the Lions. The game features over 20 jobs to try out, including plenty of Final Fantasy classics, and quality of life improvements like an autosave feature.
Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2 (October 2, 2025) Any fans of the Wii generation will be pleased to learn both Super Mario Galaxy games are getting bundled into a new edition for Switch and Switch 2, now up for preorder. These are, in my opinion, some of the best games of all time. Our 10/10 review of Super Mario Galaxy 2 seems to agree, saying the 3D platformer "perfectly captures that classic video game charm, the reason why most of us got into gaming from the start."Out October 2Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 241$69.99 at AmazonPokémon Legends: Z-A (October 16, 2025)One of the most anticipated Nintendo releases is the next mainline Pokemon game, which comes after a rare "skip" year in the franchise. Pokémon Legends: Z-A is set in Lumiose City, a town within the Kalos region that features "Wild Zones" for catching new Pokémon. Chikorita, Tepig, and Totodile are your starter options, and while they may be familiar faces, expect battles to be a little more... dynamic. Out October 16Pokémon Legends: Z-A3See it at AmazonQuit Today (October 22, 2025) If you ever wanted to completely crash out at the office, Quit Today could help you let off some steam. The beat ‘em up, which released on PC earlier this year, is focused on the workplace as you kick your coworkers’ butts to submit your resignation. Plants vs. Zombies Replanted (October 23, 2025) You read that right. Plants vs. Zombies is back with a new game PopCap describes as a "chance to reacknowledge the series' roots." With new HD character models and a multiplayer feature, I think this one's well worth checking out for anyone who enjoyed (or, in my case, got slightly addicted to) the original garden defense game. Once Upon A KATAMARI (October 25, 2025) I was a big fan of Bandai Namzo’s puzzling Katamari games on the PS2, so it’s great to see the series returning with a new entry almost 15 years later. Use your katamari, essentially a magic ball, to collect objects and recreate the universe in this journey across time.
Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection (October 30, 2025) A spread of Mortal Kombat games from across the arcade, Game Boy, and PS1 generations. We’re talking Ultimate Mortal Kombat, Sub-Zero, Tournament Edition, and plenty more (feel free to check out the full line-up). Unlock secret characters at the touch of a button and beat up your friends in online play. The collection also includes an “interactive documentary” about the franchise’s development history. PAW Patrol Rescue Wheels: Championship (October 31, 2025) Move aside, Sonic, because the PAW Patrol is also getting a racing game. Play as the iconic Pup Pals, each with their own unique skills, to win races or just cause some mayhem in Adventure Bay. Terminator 2D: NO FATE (October 31, 2025) Experience the original Terminator 2 movie, arcade style. The run-and-gun adaptation takes its inspiration from the likes of Contra and Metal Slug. Goodnight Universe (November 11, 2025) Goodnight Universe puts you in the position of being a six-month-old baby with psychic powers. I know, living the dream. While all you want is your parents' love, a tech corporation has other plans. Octopath Traveler 0 (December 4, 2025) The "final announcement" from the most recent Nintendo Direct was a new Octopath Traveler game from Square Enix. For the first time in the series, you'll be able to customize your own character, who is tasked with rebuilding the town of Wishvale while also seeking vengeance against its destroyers. Of course, you'll have plenty of party members to recruit for help. Metroid Prime 4: Beyond (December 4, 2025) Yes, it’s real. We finally got a release date for Metroid Prime 4. Now available to preorder, the game sees Samus arrive on a planet where she discovers a new slate of psychic powers and a bounty hunter dead set on taking her down. You can learn more about this one in our hands-on preview. Metroid Prime 4: Beyond (Switch)2Release Date: December 4.$59.99 at AmazonDragon Quest VII Reimagined (February 5, 2026)Dragon Quest is really going at it with the remakes. It started with HD-2D remakes of the first three games, and now we’re skipping a few installments to go straight to Fragments of the Past. This next ‘revamp’ goes for “Reimagined,” and features a pretty substantial overhaul of the graphics and gameplay from the original JRPG released in 2001.
