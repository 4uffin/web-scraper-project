With an extensive library of exclusive titles available, you can spend hundreds of hours exploring the library without ever getting bored. With so many games to play, a Nintendo Switch is a must-own console if you wish to play some of the most popular games each year. 2025 is shaping up to be another great year for the console with many more upcoming Switch games on the horizon, especially with the recent launch of the Nintendo Switch 2 bringing an entire new platform for games.Like all hardware, the Nintendo Switch tends to go on sale at specific points throughout the year and 2025 is no exception. If you are interested in picking up Nintendo's portable system, you can snag a Switch on sale if you buy at the right time. We've compiled together the best times to buy a Nintendo Switch below, complete with every sale where you might see a deal in 2025. That being said, don't expect any discounts on the Switch 2 this year outside of bundles.Note: With ongoing uncertainty surrounding U.S. tariffs, it
may be in your best interest to buy video game hardware and accessories sooner rather than later. Nintendo announced earlier this year that it is raising prices on the original Switch and sounded a warning that the price of the Switch 2 could go up down the line as well.Best Times to Buy a Nintendo SwitchBlack Friday and Cyber MondayLike most video game consoles, Black Friday and Cyber Monday are the best times of the year to buy a Nintendo Switch. Each year, Nintendo has released thepretty much the same console bundle for Black Friday: a Red/Blue Nintendo Switch with Mario Kart 8 Deluxe bundled in for free. While this deal is usually priced at $299 every year, it is possible Nintendo will discount it further as the Switch approaches the end of its lifetime. Though the recent price hikes make that uncertain. There are already two Switch 2 bundles we expect to see available through Black Friday as well, one for Mario Kart World and one for Pokemon Legends: Z-A. However it is highly unlikely any sort of price cut will be available for those.We've also seen Black Friday deals on Nintendo Switch Lite, where a free game and discount are bundled together. It is anyone's guess as to what Nintendo will have to offer for Black Friday and Cyber Monday 2024, but we would count on the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe bundle returning for another go around.2024 had some best Switch deals ever and 2025 will hopefully have even bigger disscounts thanks to the Switch 2 now being a thing.No Invite RequiredNintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World Bundle35$30 savings compared to purchasing individually.$529.99 save 6%$499.00 at AmazonHoliday WeekendsAnother great time to pick up a Nintendo Switch is one of the major holiday weekends in the United States. This includes Memorial Day Weekend, Independence Day, President's Day, and Labor Day. More often than not, retailers like Walmart and Best Buy will host exclusive three day sales, which sometimes can include deals on Nintendo Switch hardware. These discounts usually are locked behind memberships like Walmart + and My Best Buy Plus/Total, so do keep this in mind if you are aiming for the best deals.Amazon Prime DayPrime Day is always one of the most popular sales events of the year, and naturally, you can usually find a good Nintendo Switch deal on Amazon here. In addition to hardware, dozens of games and Switch accessories are always on sale. This usually makes Prime Day one of the best times to buy a Nintendo Switch, as you can save money on both the console and accessories alongside it. Amazon has already wrapped up Prime Day in 2025, but you can expect it again in mid-July. In the meantime, they are still one of the best retailers to buy Switch games from.Prime Big Deal DaysAmazon has officially announced its Prime Big Deal Days sale for 2025. This is the third consecutive year that Amazon has had its version of an October Prime Day and the dates are set for October 7-8 this time around. It's unlikely that we'll see any big discounts on Nintendo Switch hardware at Amazon during this time, but other retailers like Best Buy and Walmart will most likely drop some sort of discount to stay competitive.Clearance SalesRecently, retailers like Woot have listed Nintendo Switch models for prices we've rarely seen before, sometimes up to $75 off. These deals happen spontaneously, mostly when the retailer is clearing inventory out. To catch these deals as they happen, we recommend following the IGN Deals account to get notified immediately.It's also worth mentioning that these same retailers offer open-box and refurbished units at an even lower price, so if you are okay with open-box purchases, consider this as an option. These consoles are certified, which means the retailer has tested and verified the condition of the console. Often, the "Excellent" refurbished consoles are simply open box, with not a scratch on the system itself.Are you planning on getting a Switch 2?Yes, on day 1!
