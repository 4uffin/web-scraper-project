Designed for use with PlayStation 5 or a desktop PC gaming setup, the Pulse Elevate wireless speakers can also connect to a PlayStation Portal or your smartphone.The twin speakers — available in both Midnight Black and White — also feature a built-in microphone with "AI-enhanced noise rejection" so you can use the setup for voice chat as you play.Announced during today's State of Play broadcast, the speakers currently have just a vague 2026 release date — and there's no mention of pricing details yet either."Pulse Elevate is powered by PlayStation Link technology for ultra-low latency and lossless connectivity to deliver sound as it happens on compatible devices," wrote Edwin Foo, PlayStation's vice president of product development, in an accompanying PlayStation blog post. "Each speaker features studio-inspired planar magnetic drivers for lifelike sound across the entire audible spectrum. This means players can hear games exactly how developers intended – whether they’re playing on PS5, PC, Mac or PlayStation Portal."On PS5, you'll be able to fiddle with the speakers' volume mix to adjust EQ, sidetone, volume, and mic mute settings directly via system menus. An option to do similar on PC will be available post-launch.For more, check out everything announced during State of Play September 2025 to find out what else is coming to PlayStation 5.
