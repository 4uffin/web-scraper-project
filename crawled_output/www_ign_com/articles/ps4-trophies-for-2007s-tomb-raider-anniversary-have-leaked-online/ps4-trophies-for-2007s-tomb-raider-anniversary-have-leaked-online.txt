Well, we don't for sure, but the trophies — which can be seen on PlayStation trophy tracking site True Trophies — are limited, and the images are, too, which suggests this is a port coming to something like the PlayStation Plus game catalog rather than a full-on remake.As Redditor VeldinX explained on their thread "Anniversary leaked for PS4," "the style of this leaked list tracks with other games released for Sony’s classics catalogue, e.g. the small number of trophies and the design of the images. If it were Saber’s remaster, it would likely have a large, expansive list of things to do, and the images would be in the same style as TR1-6 were."Of course, this doesn't mean that the team that's been remastering the retro games, Aspyr, isn't also working on a new collection of classics that include Tomb Raider: Anniversary — it only suggests that these particular trophies are for a different game. Either way, we should expect clarification from either Sony or Aspyr soon. Watch this space.Tomb Raider: Anniversary is the 2007 action-adventure game developed by Crystal Dynamics, now owned by Embracer, and published by the defunct Eidos Interactive in 2007 for PC, PlayStation 2, Xbox 360, PlayStation Portable, Wii and mobile phones. It is the eighth overall entry in the Tomb Raider series and THE second in the Legend trilogy.Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.
