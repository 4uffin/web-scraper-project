Amazon is currently offering the Baseus Blade 20,000mAh 100W power bank for $39.99 shipped after you apply coupon code "3M6HOJ2F". This is similar to the last deal I posted on the same item, but this time the deal is available for everyone, not just Amazon Prime members. Unlike most high-capacity power banks that are shaped like a chunky bar, the Baseus Blade is much slimmer. It's powerful enough to charge just about every gaming handheld PC at its fastest rate.Baseus Blade 20,000mAh 100W Slim Power Bank for $39.99Baseus Blade 20,000mAh 100W Slim Power Bank3$99.99 save 60%$39.99 at AmazonUse code '3M6HOJ2F'The Baseus Blade measures only 0.7 inches thick. Most high-capacity power banks are well over 1" in thickness. The Iniu gets away with a thinner body by instead going with a wide body design, which means it's more square shaped andsquare 5" x 5". The form factor allows it to fit perfectly in a laptop bag or backpack sleeve. It still weighs in at about one pound which is comparable to other power banks, so no give or take there.The wide body allows it to squeeze in four ports: two USB Type-C ports each with 100W of Power Delivery and two USB Type-A ports each with 30W output. Note that the maximum charging output is 100W. That means although all three ports add up to a total of 160W, only a maximum of 100W will be delivered across all three ports if they are used simultaneously.The 20,000mAh capacity can fully recharge all of your gaming handheldsThis Baseus Blade boasts a generous 20,000mAh, or 74Whr battery capacity.
