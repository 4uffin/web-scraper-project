Not only did we get to see artwork of Robert Downey, Jr.‚Äôs Doctor Doom at the 2026 Disney Marketing Expo in Shanghai, China, depicting the Fantastic Four and Avengers nemesis in his regal green cloak and metal suit from the comics, but we now have a better look at the rest of the cast because of a leak from the Doomsday set. Bags handed to production members included illustrations of the same group of 27 characters we learned about from the cast reveal video earlier this year, with the addition of a young Franklin Richards, who audiences first met in The Fantastic Four: First Steps. It‚Äôs an exciting moment for fans, but one particular reveal has generated a lot of discussion online.AVENGERS: DOOMSDAY promo art featuring first look at the X-Men's costumes üëÄ pic.twitter.com/ESHQaoSXLt‚Äî Ben Geskin (@BenGeskin) September 21, 2025 For the Fox X-Men characters, the leak shows that their costumes will harken back to their looks from the comics. There seems to be a distinct ‚Äô90s influence to the designs, which makes sense because of the popularity of X-Men ‚Äô97 and Jim Lee‚Äôs iconic artwork for the team. After years of asking for more comic-accurate costumes in Fox‚Äôs X-Men movies, it looks like Marvel Studios is finally giving fans what they want with these designs. But is it too little too late? Using these costumes now when Fox‚Äôs versions of the characters are likely being put out to pasture after Avengers: Secret Wars as Marvel preps their X-Men reboot from New Avengers director Jake Schreier feels like a pittance after the X-Men movies spent two decades having mostly disdain for the more fantastical aspects of the source material.Let‚Äôs take a look at why using comic costumes for Doomsday‚Äôs X-Men is too little, too late.Fixing the Fox-MenAlthough Fox‚Äôs X-Men franchise ran for many films and was even canonized into the MCU by Deadpool & Wolverine‚Äôs multiversal shenanigans, the issues with the series have been pretty consistent ever since Bryan Singer‚Äôs first entry back in 2000. There was a lack of respect for the comic books these characters came from, diluting their bright and colorful outfits into dull and generic black combat suits. The films messed up multiple big storylines from the comics such as the Dark Phoenix Saga (twice!) and the rise of Apocalypse. The film called X-Men: First Class didn‚Äôt actually have the original first class of X-Men in it, and many beloved characters such as Cyclops, Storm, Colossus, Nightcrawler and Kitty Pryde received small roles in the series that didn‚Äôt reflect how important they are to the X-Men mythology.Jim Lee's iconic cover for X-Men #1 from 1991.That‚Äôs not to say Fox‚Äôs X-Men doesn‚Äôt have historical significance, since the first X-Men predated Sam Raimi‚Äôs Spider-Man trilogy, Christopher Nolan‚Äôs Dark Knight films, and the Marvel Cinematic Universe. After Batman & Robin‚Äôs critical and financial disappointment in 1997, X-Men getting solid reviews and making a profit three years later was a turning point for the genre. But beyond a handful of celebrated casting decisions like Patrick Stewart as Professor X, Ian McKellen as Magneto, and Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, the X-Men movies became a bizarre side note as better received and more comic-accurate superhero films took their place in the market. Even when other filmmakers like Matthew Vaughn and Simon Kinberg directed mainline entries, the X-Men series never quite escaped Bryan Singer‚Äôs uninspired aesthetic, turning one of the most vibrant corners of the Marvel universe into visual sludge.To use comic costumes now after all that baggage feels less like an overdue correction than a desperate ploy. Even when the series wasn‚Äôt under Disney‚Äôs purview, the X-Men movies teased fans with better outfits they didn‚Äôt really use. X-Men: Apocalypse (the sixth mainline X-Men film, mind you), had the team wearing more colorful outfits in the final scene, only for them to be discarded by the next installment. Seeing characters like Cyclops, Nightcrawler and Mystique wearing more comic-accurate costumes is neat in a vacuum, but this should‚Äôve been done 25 years ago. Doing it now simply doesn‚Äôt have the same impact, and it‚Äôs not a great sign for how Doomsday intends to treat its audience.Which version of the X-Men costumes do you prefer in the movies?Black leatherFirst Class yellow flight suitsComic accurate (like at the end of Apocalypse)Dark Phoenix yellow "X"sOther (Tell us in the comments.)AnswerSee ResultsThe Nostalgia CurseI‚Äôve been banging this drum for a while here at IGN but I‚Äôm doing it again: The MCU‚Äôs obsession with nostalgia is a blight on the franchise. What was once one of the most exciting blockbuster properties during the Infinity Saga has devolved into a self-defeating mess in the Multiverse Saga, with Marvel Studios largely trading their previous focus on strong structure, characterization, and respect for the source material in for a glut of content that serves to remind you of other things to distract from a lack of substance in what you‚Äôre actually watching. Even when the movies are good, Marvel pilfering characters from previous franchises like Sony‚Äôs Spider-Man movies or Fox‚Äôs X-Men films has become a crutch they‚Äôve relied on to the point of absurdity, gutting the MCU‚Äôs narrative integrity for cheap nostalgia plays.Putting these characters in the costumes they should‚Äôve been wearing decades ago highlights the mistakes Fox made in the past as well as the mistakes Marvel is making in the present. ‚ÄúPutting ancient castings for X-Men characters in the costumes they should‚Äôve been wearing decades ago only further plays into this mentality. It highlights not just the mistakes Fox has made in the past, but the mistakes Marvel is still making in the present. Even though Phases 4 and 5 have included teases of the Fox universe crossing over with the mainline MCU in Multiverse of Madness, The Marvels and Deadpool & Wolverine (even if that last one conspicuously didn‚Äôt import its leads into the MCU‚Äôs Sacred Timeline at the end), the projects have been so scattered in terms of direction and quality that not a lot of this has felt like natural build-up to the X-Men showing up in Doomsday. Whether they‚Äôre major players or just easy targets for Doctor Doom to wipe out to establish his threat level, the MCU hasn‚Äôt built enough investment in these hand-me-down X-Men to make their appearance matter to the audience.So what‚Äôs left? The baseline pleasure of seeing Cyclops sporting a costume that has blue and yellow in it? The image of Magneto‚Äôs helmet having some purple in its lining? The thought of Mystique actually wearing clothes for once? Because frankly, those things should be par for the course, not selling points. Iconic characters finally looking like themselves being talked about as a reason to be excited for Doomsday just goes to show how poorly these characters have been treated in the past. I‚Äôm not even talking about characterization or performances anymore. I‚Äôm just happy they aren‚Äôt wearing terrible outfits. It sets the bar so low, but Doomsday should have to do more than simply have these characters show up and look right to be considered a worthy adaptation of them. And that‚Äôs something Marvel should take very seriously given that they plan to introduce their own X-Men soon enough.The Most Surprising Avengers and Marvel Characters Not Announced for DoomsdayView 12 ImagesWhat Does This Mean for the MCU‚Äôs X-Men?All this talk about how the Fox X-Men will be used in Doomsday and Secret Wars also begs the question of how all of this affects Marvel‚Äôs upcoming X-Men reboot. Kevin Feige has confirmed that Secret Wars will ‚Äúreset‚Äù the MCU, allowing for director Jake Schreier to introduce a newer, younger cast of X-Men. While this presumably means that the Fox cast will be retired (and maybe we can finally get a new Wolverine), a lot of the MCU cast will likely have interacted with Fox‚Äôs X-Men in Doomsday and Secret Wars, unless there‚Äôs some massive swerve where they‚Äôre killed before they can cross over with everyone else. Will this have an impact on what can be done with the upcoming X-Men reboot? Will the MCU characters who survive the reset in Secret Wars remember the Fox X-Men? Will we keep killing Patrick Stewart‚Äôs Professor X until morale improves?X-Men: Apocalypse gave us costumes that were closer to the comics versions than ever before.More pressingly, I certainly hope that the Fox X-Men wearing ‚Äô90s inspired costumes doesn‚Äôt preclude those designs from also being used for the MCU‚Äôs X-Men. Marvel has famously refused to keep most of their superheroes in the same costume for more than one film, possibly if not definitively for the sake of marketing new toys of every character for each entry. Poor Scarlet Witch didn‚Äôt even get to keep her costume from the WandaVision finale in Multiverse of Madness. Does this mean these designs are effectively being ‚Äúwasted‚Äù on versions of X-Men who are on their way out? Because whatever form the X-Men reboot takes, it needs a fresh slate without any hindrance from what has been done with previous versions, especially when the Fox films have already made so many unforced errors in the past.I say all of this out of love for the X-Men. The X-Men license stars dozens of Marvel‚Äôs most beloved and iconic characters, and their adventures have been chronicled in decades‚Äô worth of great comics from talented creatives like Chris Claremont, John Byrne, Louise Simonson, Jim Lee, Grant Morrison and Jonathan Hickman. The X-Men should have a film series that honors that legacy, and treats these stories and characters with the respect they deserve. As for Doomsday, trying to salvage the reputation of Fox‚Äôs X-Men should be a far lower priority for Marvel than giving their own take on the brand the best foundation it can have. We‚Äôll see how Doomsday and Secret Wars shake out, but for now, I hope that Marvel Studios takes a hard look at how the X-Men have been treated by Fox‚Äôs films, and have a better answer for what went wrong than ‚Äúblack leather.‚ÄùCarlos Morales writes novels, articles, and Mass Effect essays.
