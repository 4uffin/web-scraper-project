Your job, as Atsu, is to find and eliminate all members of the Yotei Six. It’s all very Kill Bill of course, but that movie was inspired by older marital arts action movies, so Ghost of Yotei fits in a long tradition of revenge stories.Along the way, Atsu meets various allies and finds new weapons to increase her lethal capabilities. It’s an open-world game, and it’s up to you to decide which way you want to go on the map, which trails to follow, and in what order you want to dispatch the Yotei Six. Check out our Ghost of Yotei review for our critic's take on the game. Here's a preview: "A predictable but well-executed story takes you through Ghost of Yotei's gorgeous landscapes and satisfying, fluid action combat. With a strong lead in Atsu as a vigilante who does not care about honor in her quest for revenge, you get a stronger lead character and an expanded weapon-set that elevates the gameplay principles set by Tsushima. Although the novelty has lost a bit of its sheen, the Kurosawa influence is still strong and used to great effect. So while it may not be transforming open world games, Ghost of Yotei is a great refinement of the samurai power fantasy."Other Preorder Guides007 First Light Preorder Guide Battlefield 6 Preorder Guide Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Preorder Guide Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Mirror Edition Preorder Guide Dragon Quest I and II HD-2D Remake Preorder Guide Dragon Quest VII Reimagined Preorder Guide Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade (Switch, Xbox) Preorder Guide Ghost of Yotei Preorder Guide Hades 2 Preorder Guide Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment Preorder Guide Kirby Air Riders Preorder Guide Mario Tennis Fever Preorder Guide Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Preorder Guide Octopath Traveler 0 Preorder Guide Pokemon Legends Z-A Preorder Guide Silent Hill f Preorder Guide Super Mario Galaxy 1+2 Preorder Guide Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter Preorder Guide Chris Reed is a commerce editor and deals expert for IGN.
