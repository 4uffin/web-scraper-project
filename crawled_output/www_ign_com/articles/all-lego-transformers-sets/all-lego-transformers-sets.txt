One of the ways this manifests is in sets that play to adults’ nostalgia for when they were kids. We’ve seen a number of throwback LEGO Nintendo sets and various arcade machines of the era. But aside from video games, one thing that unites children of the ‘80s is a love for Transformers – and not the live-action Michael Bay versions, either. I’m talking the Transformers from the original cartoon.LEGO has only released three Transformers LEGO sets so far. But they're particularly impressive because, unlike say the LEGO Zelda Deku Tree, you can transform them between their two forms without having to disassemble them. They work just like regular Transformers toys. It’s an impressive feat of engineering that makes them fun to build and play with. So without further ado, here’s every Transformer LEGO set you can buy now.LEGO Transformers: Optimus PrimeLEGO Transformers: Optimus Prime6$161.99 at Amazon$179.99 at LEGO StoreRelease Date: June 2022MSRP: $179.99Ages: 18+Set #: 10302Piece Count: 1,508The first of the LEGO Transformers sets was the most obvious: Optimus Prime. The fearless leader of the Autobots got first dibs in the brick-built world, and that’s pretty much the only choice the folks at LEGO could have made. It’s a great set, too. It paved the way for the later Transformers sets by proving it was actually possible for a LEGO Transformer to transform from robot to vehicle without taking the bricks apart and rebuilding it. It’s quite a feat of engineering, and one that still impresses me today.We built this set when it came out, so you can check out that article for a blow-by-blow of the building process behind it. LEGO expert Kevin Wong was quite impressed with the set, writing, “That's what I feel when I look at the LEGO Optimus Prime in his Vehicle Mode, with all his limbs and parts neatly arranged into the appearance of a truck. It looks impossible at first glance, and that's the beauty of it, earning its way onto our list of the best LEGO sets.”LEGO Transformers: BumblebeeLEGO Transformers: Bumblebee7$85.84 at Amazon$89.99 at LEGO StoreRelease Date: July 2024MSRP: $89.99Ages: 18+Set #: 10338Piece Count: 950The next set to arrive was arguably the second-most-famous Transformer, and the only one to get a movie all his own: Bumblebee. This Autobot may transform into a muscle car in the live-action movies, but the LEGO set retains his VW Beetle roots from the cartoon. It’s a great build, with a lower piece count (and lower price) than the Autobot leader. The only drawback is it’s a little harder to transform. From our We Build LEGO Bumblebee feature: “Thanks to a little outside help, he's become an absolute joy to play with. I highly recommend LEGO Bumblebee, on the condition that you're not adverse to a little "Kragle," as The Lego Movie derisively refers to it. Life is too short for clutch power alone.”LEGO Transformers: SoundwaveLEGO Transformers: Soundwave5$189.99 at LEGO StoreRelease Date: August 2025MSRP: 189.99Ages: 18+Set #: 10358Piece Count: 1,505Finally, we got a Decepticon. Soundwave is the first Transformer baddie to get a dedicated LEGO set, but the result was worth the wait. Soundwave can transform into a portable cassette player, which was the height of personal tech when he debuted back in the ‘80s, and retains its retro appeal even today. From our We Build LEGO Soundwave article: “I'm so glad I was given the opportunity to build this kit. Not only is Soundwave my favorite Transformer, the LEGO Soundwave is now one of my favorite LEGO kits. The attention to detail, the cleverness employed in its transforming design, the fact he can freaking talk, this is the stuff 1980s dreams are made of. If you have the means, I highly recommend picking one up. It's so choice.”For more, check out the biggest LEGO sets you can buy now, as well as the best cheap LEGO sets.Do you want LEGO to release more Transformers sets?Yes!No!AnswerSee ResultsChris Reed is a commerce editor and deals expert for IGN.
