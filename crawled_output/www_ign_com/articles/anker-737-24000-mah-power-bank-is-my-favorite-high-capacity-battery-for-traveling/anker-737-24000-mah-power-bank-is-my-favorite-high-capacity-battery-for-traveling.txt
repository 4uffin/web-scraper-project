Amazon is offering the Anker PowerCore 737 24,000mAh Power Bank with 140W of Power Delivery for $87.99 after a 20% off discount. This is the biggest capacity power bank that I bought for myself over
two years ago and I still use it today; it has been on multiple flights and road trips and works like new. There are plenty of good battery brands nowadays, but Anker is still up there as of the most, if not the most reliable brands on Amazon.Anker 737 24,000mAh 140W Power Bank for $87.99Anker 737 24,000mAh Power Bank with 140W USB Type-C Power Delivery4$109.99 save 20%$87.99 at AmazonThe Anker 737 is still one of our highest rated favorite Steam Deck chargers. This is a relatively hefty power bank, measuring 4.6"x2.2"x2" and weighing in at 1.4lbs. It's something you'd put in your travel bag or backpack instead of your pocket. It's equipped with two USB Type-C ports and one USB Type-A port. The USB Type-C ports support a maximum of 140W of power delivery. That means a single port could deliver 140W, or both ports will deliver a combination of 140W depending on which devices are plugged in (for example, 70W + 70W or 100W + 40W).In terms of gaming handhelds, the Steam Deck supports up to 45W of charging, the Asus ROG Ally up to 65W, the Asus ROG Ally X and Legion Go up to 100W, and the Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 between 20W and 30W. That means the Anker Prime can play and charge all of these gaming handhelds simultaneously.A 24,000mAh battery equates to a 89Whr capacity. An 80% power efficiency rating (which is about standard for power banks) gives you about 71Whr of available charge. That means this power bank will charge a Steam Deck (40Whr) or Asus ROG Ally (40Whr) from empty to completely full 1.8 times, an Asus ROG Ally X (80Whr) 0.9 times, and a Nintendo Switch 2 (20Whr) about 3.6 times. You can see why a 10,000mAh power bank is too small for the more power hungry handhelds.The Anker 737 is TSA-approvedTSA states that power banks must be under 100Whr in capacity for carry-on (check-in is not allowed under any circumstances). This Anker Prime is safely under that at 74Whr. You might get checked simply because the Anker 737 is a
chunky power bank, but you shouldn't have any problems getting it cleared. I've gone through plenty of airport checkpoints and have only been checked once – at Tokyo NRT - and cleared without much hassle.How to Follow IGN Deals RecommendationsThe IGN Deals team has over 30 years of combined experience finding the best discounts and preorders available online.
