Destined Rivals Three Booster Blister Pack is cheaper by nearly $7 on TCGplayer vs Amazon, so that's a nice cheap pickup. Want to rip more packs? How about the White Flare Booster Bundle coming in at $11.99 cheaper on TCGPlayer? That's a big difference to put towards more boosters instead of lining Amazons deep pockets. Need some more Prismatic Evolutions in your life? Well the Mini Tins are just over $10 cheaper on TCGPlayer too, and these savings all add up when you're after ripping as many packs as possible.Batman Blu-Ray SaleBatman 4K Film Collection (4K Ultra HD + Blu-ray) [4K UHD]5$89.99 save 63%$32.99 at AmazonBatman: The Complete Animated Series (1992) (Blu-ray)2$79.99 save 64%$28.99 at Amazon(Used)The Dark Knight Trilogy: Ultimate Collector's Edition (BD +Digital HD UltraViolet) [Blu-ray]0$34.99 save 29%$25.00 at AmazonBatman, The (4K Ultra HD + Blu-ray)0$33.99 save 63%$12.49 at AmazonThe Dark Knight (4K Ultra HD) [4K UHD]3$34.98 save 64%$12.49 at AmazonBatman & Robin (1997) (4K Ultra HD + Blu-ray + Digital) [4K UHD]0$24.98 save 54%$11.49 at AmazonBatman Forever (4K Ultra HD + Blu-ray + Digital) [4K UHD]1$24.98 save 50%$12.39 at AmazonBatman: Hush (4K Ultra HD + Blu-ray)0$24.98 save 52%$11.99 at AmazonThe Dark Knight Rises (4K Ultra HD)1$34.98 save 64%$12.49 at AmazonWho's your favorite Batman?

Serving as the foundation of "New Game +" modes and sporting the late great Akira Toriyama's artwork, Chrono Trigger is JRPG nostalgia bottled, and still tastes great 30 years later. It's a great chance to grab one of the best games ever made, complete with new animé cutscenes, for an absolute steal.JSAUX Carrying Case for Nintendo Switch 2JSAUX Carrying Case for Nintendo Switch 20$23.99 save 25%$17.99 at AmazonJsaux have been making cases, screen protectors and the like for longer than I can remember, and it's quality gear. I've been personally using this case for my Nintendo Switch 2 when i'm out and about, and it's great having that extra bit a tough protection for when I inevitably drop it on the pavement. It's not going to make you get more banannas in DK, but it's a good carry case for under $18.Duo of Justice Capcom Game Bundle (Steam)Duo of Justice Capcom Game Bundle (Steam)0$254.00 save 86%$35.00 at HumbleI object to anyone not grabbing this bundle, and i'll never apologise for that Ace Attorney reference either.
