After months of worrying speculation, we finally got a release date for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond during the recent Nintendo Direct. It's confirmed for December 4, 2025 (phew!), and already up for preorder at Amazon.Featured in this articleMetroid Prime 4: Beyond SeriesSamus & Vi-O-La - amiibo1$39.99 at AmazonMetroid Prime 4: Beyond SeriesSamus - amiibo0$29.99 at AmazonMetroid Prime 4: Beyond SeriesSylux - amiibo0$29.99 at AmazonMetroid Prime 4: Beyond (Switch 2)0$69.99 at AmazonMetroid Prime 4: Beyond (Switch)1$59.88 at WalmartBut if you tuned into the Nintendo Direct, you may have noticed a couple of extra key details. Firstly, Samus on a bike (huh?), and secondly, Samus on a bike as an amiibo that you can buy (no way!).Samus & Vi-O-La amiiboMetroid Prime 4: Beyond SeriesSamus & Vi-O-La - amiibo1Release Date: November 6.$39.99 at AmazonGet it at AmazonGet it at WalmartGet it at GameStopYes, it's true, and a press release post-Nintendo Direct also confirmed this "technologically advanced bike" is named the Vi-O-La.The Samus & Vi-O-La amiibo costs $39.99 and is available to preorder now from Walmart, but it's not the only amiibo figure Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is getting, either.Samus amiiboMetroid Prime 4: Beyond SeriesSamus - amiibo0Release Date: November 6.$29.99 at AmazonGet it at AmazonGet it at WalmartGet it at GameStopThe standalone Samus amiibo costs $29.99, alongside the "enigmatic bounty hunter" Sylux, which is also $29.99. Both Samus amiibo will arrive on November 6, before Prime 4 hits shelves, while the Sylux amiibo will arrive on release day for December 4. We're yet to know exactly how the new amiibo will work with the new game, with details about functionality within Metroid Prime 4: Beyond expected to be announced at a later date.Sylux amiiboMetroid Prime 4: Beyond SeriesSylux - amiibo0Release Date: December 4.$29.99 at AmazonGet it at AmazonGet it at WalmartGet it at GameStopIn case you missed it, Kirby Air Riders is also getting two amiibo alongside its upcoming release this year as well, and both are also up for preorder right now.Of course, amiibo aren’t the only thing fans have to look forward to right now. Nintendo recently gave us a fresh look at Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, where Samus can be seen tearing across a vast open area on a motorbike-style vehicle, a striking change of pace for the series. It’s the long-awaited follow-up to 2007’s Metroid Prime 3: Corruption on Wii, and its road to release has been anything but simple. Development originally started at Bandai Namco Studios before Nintendo handed the project back to Retro Studios, the team behind the original trilogy, after two years. For a long time, things went quiet, but the game was formally re-announced in 2024 and has since been confirmed as a cross-gen release for both Switch and Switch 2.Other Preorder Guides007 First Light Preorder Guide Battlefield 6 Preorder Guide Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Preorder Guide Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Mirror Edition Preorder Guide Dragon Quest I and II HD-2D Remake Preorder Guide Dragon Quest VII Reimagined Preorder Guide Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade (Switch, Xbox) Preorder Guide Ghost of Yotei Preorder Guide Hades 2 Preorder Guide Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment Preorder Guide Kirby Air Riders Preorder Guide Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Preorder Guide Octopath Traveler 0 Preorder Guide Pokemon Legends Z-A Preorder Guide Silent Hill f Preorder Guide Super Mario Galaxy 1+2 Preorder Guide Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter Preorder Guide How to Follow IGN Deals RecommendationsThe IGN Deals team has over 30 years of combined experience finding the best discounts and preorders available online.
