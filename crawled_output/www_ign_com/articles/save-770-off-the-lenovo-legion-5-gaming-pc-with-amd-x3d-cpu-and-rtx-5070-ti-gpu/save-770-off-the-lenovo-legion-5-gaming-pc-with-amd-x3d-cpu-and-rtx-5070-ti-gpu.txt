The processor is (air)cooled by a robust 120mm tower heatsink and fan combo. A total of six 120mm RGB fans and a sensibly designed 30L midtower chassis keeps your components quiet and cool. An 850W 80PLUS Gold power supply provides plenty of power. The case offers toolless entry and most of the components are non-proprietary, so they are easy to swap out or upgrade yourself down the road.The AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D is still an outstanding gaming CPUThe AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D has an established reputation of being one of the best gaming CPUs available. It's a slightly older model that has been replaced by the newer Ryzen 9 98000X3D, but it is still one of the best gaming CPUs you can get today. According to Passmark, the 7800X3D's gaming performance surpasses that of the latest generation Intel Core Ultra 7 265K. The 7800X3D is also more efficient than the 9800X3D, which means it will consume less power and produce less heat (and thus less noise because your fans don't need to spin as fast).The RTX 5070 Ti GPU Has Excellent 4K Gaming PerformanceOf all the Blackwell cards released thus far, the RTX 5070 Ti offers the best bang for your buck, especially when pitted against the previous generation GPUs. It performs neck-and-neck with the RTX 4080 Super and marginalizes the RTX 5080, which is only about 10%-15% faster but costs 33% more. Like all Blackwell cards, the RTX 5070 Ti supports DLSS 4 with multi-frame generation. It also has 16GB of GDDR7 VRAM same as the RTX 5080, making it suitable for AI.Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti GPU Review by Jacqueline Thomas"At $749, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is the best 4K graphics card for most people, delivering much better value than either the RTX 5080 or 5090. Across my entire test suite, this GPU soared at 4K, coming within striking distance of much more expensive graphics cards, and that’s before taking multi frame generation into account, which will make the RTX 5070 Ti even better at hitting extremely high framerates, albeit with a hit to latency."Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.
