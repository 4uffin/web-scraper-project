The 16X
Aurora is far and away the laptop I would recommend for anyone who has a vested interest in gaming. It uses less plastic, boasts a higher quality display, and is equipped with a more powerful CPU and GPU. Naturally, it's usually considerably more expensive. Usually, it's also more expensive. However, right now there's an excellent deal that actually drops the price to below the price of an equivalently configured 16 (non-X) Aurora.Alienware 16X Aurora RTX 5070 Gaming Laptop for $1,599.99New ReleaseAlienware 16X Aurora Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX RTX 5070 (115W) Gaming Laptop (16GB/1TB)6$1,999.99 save 20%$1,599.99 at AlienwareGamers should go with the Alienware 16X Aurora modelThe Alienware 16X Aurora is the model that serious gamers should consider over the 16 Aurora, especially right now when a comparable 16 Aurora is about the same price. There's little argument here; just look at all of the upgrades:Better display (2560x1600 240Hz G-Sync vs 2560x1600 120Hz)More powerful CPU (Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX vs Intel Core 9 270H)Higher RTX 5070 TGP rating and thus better performance (115W TGP vs 85W TGP)More premium materials (metal alloy lid and chassis vs lid only)RGB keyboard vs white-only backlightingThunderbolt 4.0 portCompared to other Alienware laptops, the 16X Aurora is designed to look less like a gamer's laptop. It boasts a sleek, understated design with the absence of extraneous visual-only embellishments or unnecessary RGB lighting outside of the keyboard illumination. This is a solidly built machine with a metal (magnesium alloy) chassis and anodized aluminum lid and bottom shell. Under the hood, the 16X Aurora still packs a punch with
powerful gaming components and a robust Cryo Chamber cooling system. It's much more affordably than an equivalent Alienware 16 Area-51 laptop, which costs $1,200 more. The Alienware 16X Aurora also weighs 1.6 pounds less and has a 30% thinner profile.The Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX is a top performing CPUThe Alienware 16X Aurora laptop is also equipped with a very powerful CPU as well. The Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX boasts a max turbo frequency of 5.4GHz with a whopping 24 cores and 40MB total L2 cache. According to Passmark, this is the second most powerful Intel mobile CPU available right now and goes head to head with AMD's Ryzen 9 7945HX3D.The GeForce RTX 5070 is 5%-10% better than the RTX 4070The mobile RTX 5070 GPU performs about 5%-10% better than the RTX 4070 that it replaces. That's not a very big generational improvement, but the RTX 5070 also supports multi-frame generation, which means the margin will widen in games that support DLSS 4.0. If you want a significantly better performing Nvidia GPU, you'll have to pick up an RTX 5070 Ti or RTX 5080 laptop. Currently the Alienware 16X Aurora doesn't have an option to equip these GPUs, so you would have to pony up $900 more for the Area-51.Check out more of the best Alienware dealsCheck out our Best Alienware Deals article with all of Dell's currently ongoing deals on gaming laptops and desktop PCs.
