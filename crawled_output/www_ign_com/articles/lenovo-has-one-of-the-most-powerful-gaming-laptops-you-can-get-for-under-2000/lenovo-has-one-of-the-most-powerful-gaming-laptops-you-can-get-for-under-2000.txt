Right now you can get the Lenovo Legion Pro 5i Gen 10 gaming laptop, equipped with an OLED display and RTX 5070 Ti GPU, for just $1,764.99 after you apply coupon code: "EXTRAFIVE". That's a total of $705 off in combined savings.

The Legion Pro features an aluminum top lid and a sturdy plastic bottom chassis. The display is an absolute stunner thanks to the true OLED panel with a razor sharp 2.5K 189ppi resolution, 165Hz refresh rate, HDR 1000 True Black certification, and 100%DCI-P3 color space. This new 2025 model has also been updated with the Wi-Fi 7 standard.

According to Passmark, this is second most powerful Intel mobile CPU available right now and goes head to head with AMD's Ryzen 9 9955HX.The GeForce RTX 5070 Ti mobile GPU is better than the RTX 4080 mobileThe Legion Pro 5 laptop offers a more substantial cooling design than the Legion 5 (non-Pro) and is able to accomodate more powerful GPUs like the RTX 5070 Ti. That's important if you want to be able to play games comfortably on the display's enhanced 2560x1600 resolution. The RTX 5070 Ti mobile GPU is a substantial upgrade over the 4070 Ti. In fact, it offers gaming performance on par with the RTX 4080 and takes the lead in any games that support DLSS 4 with multi-frame generation (the RTX 4080 only supports DLSS 3). You'd have to pay hundreds more to upgrade to an RTX 5080.How to Follow IGN Deals RecommendationsThe IGN Deals team has over 30 years of combined experience finding the best discounts and preorders available online.
