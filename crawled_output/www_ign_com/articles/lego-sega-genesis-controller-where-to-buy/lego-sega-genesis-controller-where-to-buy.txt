The good news is that LEGO has released an awesome set that re-creates the classic SEGA Genesis controller (see it at LEGO Store). It even houses an incredibly cool Sonic the Hedgehog easter egg. That’s the good news. The bad news is, it’s only available between now and September 17 (that's today), and to get this set, you have to spend $130+ at the LEGO Store. Gift With PurchaseSEGA Genesis Controller4Only available 9/8 - 9/17 with purchases $130+. Not sold separately.See it at LEGO StoreSet Number: 40769Price: N/A (only available as Gift with Purchase)Ages: 18+Pieces: 260 Dimensions: over 3.5 in. (10 cm) high, 5.5 in. (15 cm) wide and 1 in. (3 cm) deepThat’s because the LEGO SEGA Genesis Controller set is a Gift With Purchase. GWP sets are generally smaller sets that are not available to purchase separately. They’re only available by buying a particular set or reaching a certain price threshold at the LEGO Store. The threshold here is $130, but I tested it and thankfully a $129.99 set also works. However, it doesn’t apply to preorders, only to in-stock sets. It’s also worth highlighting that this set is also only available while supplies last. I’ve seen many GWP sets sell out well before their end date. Here are some set ideas to rack up your LEGO Store total:Super Mario World: Mario & Yoshi1$129.99 at LEGO StoreMario Kart – Mario & Standard Kart0$159.99 at LEGO StoreTeam Sonic Command Truck0$69.99 at LEGO StoreShadow the Hedgehog0$69.99 at LEGO StoreThe Legend of Zelda: Great Deku Tree 2-in-10$299.99 at LEGO StoreTransformers: Soundwave0$189.99 at LEGO StoreThe Simpsons: Krusty Burger0$209.99 at LEGO StoreBatman: The Animated Series Gotham City0$299.99 at LEGO StorePAC-MAN Arcade1$269.99 at LEGO StoreThe LEGO SEGA Genesis Controller set (say that five times fast) is comprised of 260 pieces and aimed at the 18+ age category, making it a LEGO set for adults. It’s meant for display rather than play (hence the 18+ age designation). It comes with a buildable stand and looks pretty much just like the controller you remember playing Genesis on.On the back of the controller is a microscale scene from Sonic the Hedgehog. It’s a cleverly designed 2D view of Sonic rolling through a loop in the Green Hill Zone. It also comes with regional stickers to decorate the face of the controller.To get this Genesis GWP, you can spend $130 on a single set, or on multiple sets that add up to that amount. Above, I’ve gone ahead and highlighted some sets you may be interested in if you’re a SEGA Genesis fan. If you want more options, feel free to peruse the LEGO Store’s full catalog here.Some of the best retro gaming sets are based on Nintendo. There’s an awesome Mairo & Yoshi set that I put together for a We Build article that costs $129.99, exactly enough to get you the free GWP. It’s my favorite LEGO set that I own, and I have it sitting right here on my desk.There are also some cool Sonic-themed sets you can pick up to get the controller. For instance, buying the Shadow the Hedgehog bust, plus the Sonic Command Truck, puts you over the $130 mark.Unfortunately, preorders don't count toward the $130, so the LEGO Game Boy is a no-go for it. Neither is the LEGO Willy Wonka set, which comes out the day after the Genesis controller GWP goes away. However, if the controller stays in stock, you will be able to get it with LEGO Jack Sparrow's Pirate Ship, if that's a set you've had an eye (patch) on. Basically, as with all things, do whatever makes sense for you.Chris Reed is a commerce editor and deals expert for IGN. He also runs IGN's board game and LEGO coverage.
