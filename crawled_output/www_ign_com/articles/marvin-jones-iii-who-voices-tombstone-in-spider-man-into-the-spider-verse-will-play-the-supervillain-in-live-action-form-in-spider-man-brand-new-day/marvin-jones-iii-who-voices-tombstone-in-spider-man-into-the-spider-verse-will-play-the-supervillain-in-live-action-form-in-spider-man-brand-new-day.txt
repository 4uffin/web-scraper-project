Photo by Albert L. Ortega/Getty Images.Tombstone is a giant, near indestructible New York crime boss who has become a popular Spider-Man supervillain since making his debut in Marvel Comics' The Spectacular Spider-Man #139, released in April 1988. Here’s the official blurb from Marvel’s website:Of all the formidable foes in Spider-Man's rogues gallery, few are as grim-faced as Tombstone, the New York mobster otherwise known as Lonnie Lincoln. Whether working solo, as part of an organized crime outfit, or on a super villain team, Tombstone has consistently posed a grave threat to Spider-Man.More than just being an enemy of Spider-Man, however, Tombstone also has ties to people very close to Peter Parker, making him an even more personal adversary for the web-slinging hero.Tombstone is set to appear in Spider-Man: Brand New Day. Image credit: Marvel.com.Marvin Jones III, who played supervillain Tobias Whale in the live-action Arrowverse series Black Lightning from 2018-2021, and, most recently, Cysgod in action thriller Shadow Force, joins Tom Holland as Spider-Man, Zendaya as MJ, Jacob Batalon as Ned, Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner / The Hulk, Jon Bernthal as Frank Castle / Punisher, and Stranger Things star Sadie Sink and Liza Colón-Zayas in Brand New Day. The MCU film is still on track for a July 31, 2025 release despite a recent production delay due to Holland’s recent head injury.Holland has described Spider-Man: Brand New Day as the "first movie in the next chapter" of his web-slinging film series, although he plans to take a break from acting in 2027. Holland has yet to be confirmed for next year’s Avengers: Doomsday nor 2027’s Avengers: Secret Wars, although it’s hard to imagine an Avengers movie without him.Once he's done with Spider-Man: Brand New Day, Marvin Jones III will reprise his animated Tombstone role for 2027’s hotly anticipated Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse.Photo by Albert L.
