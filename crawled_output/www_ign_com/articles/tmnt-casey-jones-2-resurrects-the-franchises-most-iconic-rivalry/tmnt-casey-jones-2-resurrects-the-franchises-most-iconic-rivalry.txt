Fans of 1990's TMNT movie and other stories exploring the rivalry between Casey and Raphael will be pleased to know that their feud is heating up again in the second chapter of TMNT: Casey Jones.Check out the slideshow gallery below for an exclusive preview of TMNT: Casey Jones #2:TMNT: Casey Jones #2 Preview GalleryView 8 ImagesTMNT: Casey Jones #1 is written by Alex Paknadel (Cult of the Lamb: The First Verse) and drawn by Amancay Nahuelpan (Crush & Lobo), with colors by Luis Antonio Delgado. This issue features covers by Nahuelpan, Nikola Čižmešija, and Jared Cullum. Here's IDW's official description of the issue:Before Casey Jones meets his brand-new enemy Ludovic, he’ll have to do battle with his best friend Raphael first! Casey is investigating the rumors of a phony mutagen hitting the streets and seeking out whoever is going after mutants on the street, knowing in his gut they are connected. But he’s soon stopped by Raphael, who thinks Casey is pushing himself too hard and not listening to his better instincts. Casey and Raph fight through their feelings before being stopped by Ludovic, who wants to battle them both."Now you've met Ludovic, and you just know he's on a collision course with our all-too-human Casey," Paknadel tells IGN. "Trust me, our boy is about to be put through the wringer in ways you've never seen before. We hope you'll join us for the ride because we're just getting started."Nahuelpan adds, “I had a blast drawing Casey and the whole team in issue 1, and I can’t wait for the fans to see what’s coming next, with bigger fights and bigger threats for our boy!”TMNT: Casey Jones #1 is available in comic shops now. Issue #2 will be released on November 19, with a final order cutoff of October 13. You can order both issues at your local comic shop.For more on TMNT, find out how to read IDW's TMNT comics in 2025.
