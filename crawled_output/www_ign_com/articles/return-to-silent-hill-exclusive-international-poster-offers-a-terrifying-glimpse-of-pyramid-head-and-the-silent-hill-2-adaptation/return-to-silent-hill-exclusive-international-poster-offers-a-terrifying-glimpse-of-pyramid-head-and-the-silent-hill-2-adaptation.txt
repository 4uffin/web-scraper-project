The poster, which you can see below, looks to star the eye of Jeremy Irvine's James Sunderland. However, if you look a little closer, you may notice one of the most iconic villains in all of Silent Hill in its reflection."Return to Silent Hill brings the iconic horror franchise back to the screen," the official description reads. "When James receives a mysterious letter from his lost love Mary, he is drawn to Silent Hill—a once-familiar town now consumed by darkness. As he searches for her, James faces monstrous creatures and unravels a terrifying truth that will push him to the edge of his sanity."This film tells more of a standalone story and isn't quite connected to 2006's Silent Hill or 2012's Silent Hill: Revelation, but, as Gans puts it, "Return to Silent Hill is an adaptation created out of deep respect for a true masterpeice of a game, Konami's iconic SIlent Hill 2."Joining Irvine will be Hannah Emily Anderson as Mary Crane and Evie Templeton as Laura. Gans will also be writting the film alongside Sandra Vo-Anh and William Schneider.
