Comic Con Decision to Resurrect Stan Lee Via an AI Hologram and Charge $20 for a 3-Minute Conversation"We'll never put words in his mouth that aren't in line with things he spoke about in his lifetime."Marvel fans have reacted in anger and dismay at plans to feature an AI likeness of the late comic book legend Stan Lee at the upcoming L.A. Comic Con.A recreation of Lee will be present at the show via a partnership between technology company Proto Hologram and Kartoon Studios, which owns the rights to Lee's likeness. Fans will then be able to "meet" and have a conversation with the hologram, with tickets costing between $15 and $20 for a three-minute chat.But despite reassurances from Kartoon that this AI-powered version of Stan Lee will be "faithful" to the spirit of the much-missed man, many Marvel fans have voiced their distate for the idea — calling it "gross," "incredibly disrespectful," and "f***ing weird."The Stan Lee hologram. Image credit: Proto Hologram/The Hollywood Reporter."We'll never put words in his mouth that aren't in line with things he spoke about in his lifetime," Kartoon Studios' Head of Stan Lee Legacy Programs Bob Sabouni told The Hollywood Reporter. "Fortunately, with decades of footage capturing his thoughts on so many subjects, we can build a voice that stays true, not always word for word, but always faithful in spirit, context, and intent."As well as interacting with fans, the Stan Lee hologram is also planned to appear elsewhere within the L.A. Comic Con, which runs September 26-28, with the suggestion being that the software will also be used to introduce panels.Reaction to the idea from fans has been universally negative, with many highlighting the bizarre nature of seeing the late Marvel legend "revived" via digital means, and words put in his mouth via an algorithm. Others, meanwhile, have pointed to the contentious situation that surrounds the rights to Lee's digital likeness. Legally, Kartoon Studios acquired the rights to Lee's name and physical likeness as part of an exclusive deal with Lee's own company POW! Entertainment. But, shortly before his death in 2018, Lee also attempted to sue POW! Entertainment, claiming the company's other chiefs conspired to "fraudulently steal" his name and likeness and benefit financially at his expense. Lee was 95 at the time of this lawsuit, and by his own admission had suffered from advanced macular degeneration for several years, a condition that left him unable to read unaided. "Even in death, they won't let the guy rest," wrote Marvel fan RCGBlade on reddit. "It's all pretty dystopian.""This is wrong and incredibly disrespectful," wrote a second, Adrellan. "There's a reason we say 'Rest in Peace' when someone passes away.""I'm not even gonna comment on the ethics of the thing," said a third fan, JANTlvr. "This is f***ing weird."Of course, this isn't the first time that a celebrity's voice has been used by AI following their death. James Earl Jones previously granted Disney the rights to continue using his performance as Darth Vader. The voice has since been heard in Disney+ series Obi-Wan Kenobi and within Fortnite as a chatty teammate you can converse with via AI speech generation.Image credit: Proto Hologram/The Hollywood Reporter.Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
