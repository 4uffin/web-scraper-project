When you have a series that's consistently gotten new games for almost 40 years, you have to think about how younger generations will be able to play them. That, and, of course, thinking about your bottom line, has led every publisher to lean more and more into multiplatform releases. On top of PC ports, Square Enix has released a decent amount of remasters and special editions of the Final Fantasy series specifically for Nintendo's handheld. The Final Fantasy games hitting Switch isn't entirely unprecedented. The connection between Final Fantasy and Nintendo dates back to the series’ infancy, when the first game debuted on Nintendo's Famicom system in 1987. In fact, the first six mainline Final Fantasy games debuted on Nintendo platforms before Square Enix jumped to PlayStation as the series’ primary platform with Final Fantasy 7. With a solid Magic: The Gathering expansion bringing Final Fantasy back into the spotlight in 2025, plenty of people are hoping to dive into the series for the first time. Below, we’ve compiled a complete list of Final Fantasy games available on Switch and a look at what's coming to the Switch 2.Every IGN Final Fantasy Game ReviewView 94 ImagesHow Many Final Fantasy Games Are Available on Switch?There are 20 Final Fantasy games you can play on the Switch — 12 mainline games, one prequel, and seven spinoffs.

(All such games are included in the list below.)Every Mainline Final Fantasy Game on SwitchFinal Fantasy 1–6 Pixel RemasterThe first six Final Fantasy games are all available on Switch as part of Square Enix’s Pixel Remaster collection. Each game has been overhauled with new graphics, rearranged soundtracks, updated UIs, and new galleries for players to explore the creatures, illustrations, and music from all six games. If you're interested in diving into the original Final Fantasy experience, this is the best way to do it. The Pixel Remasters are available individually ($12–18 USD/each) or as part of the six-game Final Fantasy I–VI bundle ($75 USD). If you're looking at the games individually, I'd recommend FF6, as it has one of the more immersive storylines. Final Fantasy I-VI CollectionSquare EnixApr 19, 2023Rate this gameFinal Fantasy 7One of the series’ most beloved games, Final Fantasy VII, is also available on Switch. This is not a remastered version of the game but rather a port of the 1997 original with three extra features: a 3x speed mode, the ability to turn battle encounters off, and a battle enhancement mode to make encounters easier. While the newer remasters, Remake and Rebirth, introduce modern action RPG mechanics to Cloud Strife's battle against Sephiroth, the Switch edition of FFVII is one of the best opportunities to experience what made the original PlayStation game so impactful.
