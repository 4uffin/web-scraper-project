Although never publicly discussed, it's thought Netflix scrapped plans for the independent season after seeing that early footage.Now, Redanian Intelligence claims the project is back on the books, albeit as a standalone movie this time, with the logline: "six teenage thieves must rely on their criminal skills as they plan the biggest heist of their careers against the most dangerous crime ring in the kingdom."The new project will reportedly be directed by Mairzee Almas and written by Haily Hall. The Witcher showrunner Lauren Hissrich and exec producer Tomek Baginski are set to produce the film.Redanian Intelligence suggested it'll follow the same gang of teenage criminals we met in Season 3 Episode 8, although it's unclear if Dolph Lundgren — who portrayed the witcher Brehen, the Cat of Iello — will also be making an appearance in the truncated project.The prospective movie is, of course, not the only live-action adaptation of the best-selling fantasy series. Netflix's The Witcher show is an epic tale of fate and family where Geralt of Rivia, a solitary monster hunter, struggles to find his place in a world where people often prove more wicked than beasts.
