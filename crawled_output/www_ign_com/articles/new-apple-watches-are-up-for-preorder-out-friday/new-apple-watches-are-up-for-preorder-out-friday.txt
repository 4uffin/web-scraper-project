There’s the new Apple Watch Series 11, the cheaper Apple Watch SE 3, and the rugged, pricier Apple Watch Ultra 3. All three new wearables will be available September 19, but preorders are live now at all the usual retailers (see them at Amazon). For a closer look at the new features of each new Apple Watch model, keep on reading.Featured in this articleOut September 19Apple Watch Series 110$399.00 at AmazonOut September 19Apple Watch SE 30$249.00 at AmazonOut September 19Apple Watch Ultra 30$799.00 at AmazonOut September 19Apple AirPods Pro 31$249.00 at AmazonAbove, you'll find the entry-level version of each new model of Apple Watch. If you click into any of the listings, you can select various optional upgrades, like larger sizes, cellular connectivity, color, band, and more. Go in and play around with them to see which one you like best.Apple Watch Series 11Out September 19Apple Watch Series 110$399.00 at AmazonGet it at AmazonGet it at AppleGet it at Best BuyGet it at WalmartApple Watch Series 11 is the new flagship model of Apple’s smartwatch. It starts at $399. Its glass display is 2X more scratch resistant than the Series 10. The battery now lasts a full 24 hours, which means it’s more likely to stay powered through the night for sleep tracking (about which, see below). The cellular model also now supports 5G.But the main selling points here are the two new health features. One is a warning it can send you if it detects possible high blood pressure, one of the leading indicators of heart problems. The other is a new sleep score that’s based on sleep duration, bedtime consistency, wake-up time, and how long you spend in each sleep stage. All of that info is combined into a single score you can try to raise for better sleep health.Apple Watch SE 3Out September 19Apple Watch SE 30$249.00 at AmazonGet it at AmazonGet it at AppleGet it at Best BuyGet it at WalmartThe next model to get a refresh is Apple Watch SE, the entry-level option that has fewer features but comes at a lower price. This new model runs on the S10 chip, which is the exact same one found in the new Series 11. For the first time in the SE line, it also features an always-on display. It also offers the new sleep score feature.However, both size options for the SE are 2mm smaller than the options for the 11. The display isn’t as bright, and it lacks various sensors, so it can’t do hypertension notifications, ECG, or blood oxygen level detection. And its battery is rated for 18 hours, rather than 24. But the price is right, and this is still a killer entry-level smartwatch.Apple Watch Ultra 3 (GPS + Cellular, 49mm)Out September 19Apple Watch Ultra 30$799.00 at AmazonGet it at AmazonGet it at AppleGet it at Best BuyFor those who absolutely, positively must have the top-of-the-line smartwatch, there’s the Apple Watch Ultra 3. It’s aimed primarily at the rugged outdoorsy types who like going off the grid for things like hiking, camping, biking, and diving. To that end, it introduces satellite communications, so it can send messages and SOS when you’re away from cell towers.It offers up to 42 hours of battery life on a charge, and its new display has thinner borders, making the screen larger. It's also brighter when viewed at wider angles. It, too, has 5G cellular, sleep score, and hypertension alerts. And its watch faces can show seconds ticking by, for the first time.All told, this is a pretty standard year for Apple Watch upgrades. You get some new hardware sensors and functions in the Series 11 and Ultra 3, while the SE 3 catches up to some of the features previous models lacked. If your smartwatch is in need of replacement, you really can’t go wrong with any of these.And if you're interested in upgrading your earbuds, Apple also announced the AirPods Pro 3. They cost $249 and release September 19, the same day as the Apple Watches.Chris Reed is a commerce editor and deals expert for IGN. He also runs IGN's board game and LEGO coverage.
