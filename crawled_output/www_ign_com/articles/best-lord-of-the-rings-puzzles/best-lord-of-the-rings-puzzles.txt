If anything, there are way too many options to choose from. Because of this, it can sometimes help to narrow down your search to a specific franchise you love. You can never go wrong with a puzzle depicting one of your favorite stories or characters, and the end result can sometimes even be display worthy.One such franchise that has some great puzzle options is The Lord of the Rings. J.R.R. Tolkien's world has been expanded beyond books to be portrayed in movies, video games, and even LEGO sets, so it shouldn't be too surprising that there are some enticing jigsaw options too. I've found six of the best best Lord of the Rings puzzles that are available online right now.TL;DR — These Are the Best Lord of the Rings Puzzles2000 pieces Ravensburger Lord of The Rings: The Return of The King23See it at Amazon1000 piecestheory11 Lord of The Rings Jigsaw Puzzle22See it at Amazon204 piecesLord of The Rings Barad-Dur Eye of Sauron 3D Model Kit13See it at Amazon1000 Pieces Aquarius Hobbit Map Puzzle21See it at Amazon100 PiecesMyPuzzle Hobbit House13See it at Amazon1000 PiecesAQUARIUS Lord of the Rings Triptych Puzzle0See it at AmazonLotR-Themed Book Nook Kit0See it at AmazonWhat is the best piece count for jigsaw puzzles?300 piece puzzle500 piece puzzle750 piece puzzle1000 piece puzzle2000 piece puzzleAnswerSee ResultsLord of the Rings: The Return of the King PuzzleBest Overall2000 pieces Ravensburger Lord of The Rings: The Return of The King23See it at AmazonIf you're a fan of the Lord of the Rings movies like I am, then this Return of the King puzzle is an excellent option. It features main characters and scenes from the final film in the trilogy and has a nice border around the whole thing. You've got Frodo struggling to drop the ring into the fires of Mount Doom, Gandalf in the heat of battle, and Aragorn accepting his rightful role as king. What more could you need?This puzzle was also made by Ravensburger, which is one of the best overall puzzle brands out there. Every piece is unique and fits together perfectly.

The design of this 1,000-piece puzzle has a similar look and feel to some of the original illustrations from J.R.R Tolkien himself. The green and gold colors also go really well together with the illustrated style.If you like the look and feel of illustrated Lord of the Rings books, you'll like how this puzzle comes together. It's a great option if you are looking for something to frame and display once it's completed.Barad-Dur Eye of Sauron 3D Model KitBest 3D Puzzle204 piecesLord of The Rings Barad-Dur Eye of Sauron 3D Model Kit13See it at AmazonAlthough the standard jigsaw puzzles on this list are all great options, there's a growing market of model kits for adults out there that bring puzzles into 3D space. This particular puzzle kit from 4D Build features the massive tower of Sauron in all its glory. Unlike many other model kits, it doesn't require any glue or tools to put together.With a total of 204 pieces that come in 14 sheets, this is also an excellent LEGO alternative to the massive Barad-Dur LEGO set because it's less than $40. It's one of our most recommended 3D puzzle kits out of any franchise.Hobbit Map of Middle Earth PuzzleBest Map Puzzle1000 Pieces Aquarius Hobbit Map Puzzle21See it at AmazonAnother great option for anyone looking for a puzzle worthy of displaying somewhere is this 1,000-piece map of Middle Earth. The map features prominent locations from the story with the Shire as a focal point. Since this is the map from the Hobbit, it doesn't include every location in Middle Earth, but it is the overall best Lord of the Rings map puzzle I've been able to find. You can always browse the interactive map online if you want to see where Mordor and Gondor are located.Hobbit House PuzzleBest for Beginners100 PiecesMyPuzzle Hobbit House13See it at AmazonWhile I prefer the challenge of a good 1,000- or 2,000-piece puzzle, not everyone likes digging through a mountain of pieces to complete a picture. This simple 100-piece puzzle is a great option for beginners or casual puzzlers who just want something easy to put together in an afternoon. The image itself depicts a lovely Hobbit home in New Zealand and it's an actual destination you can visit!Aquarius Lord of the Rings Triptych PuzzleBest Movie Poster Alternative1000 PiecesAQUARIUS Lord of the Rings Triptych Puzzle0See it at AmazonThis last puzzle is my top pick for anyone looking for an alternative to movie posters. This is essentially all three movie posters from the trilogy on top of a map, but in puzzle form. So you'll be able to piece together the image and then have something worth hanging on your wall. This is an awesome gift for any Lord of the Rings fan who loves the movies and puzzles.LotR-Themed Book NookBest Book Nook Puzzle KitLotR-Themed Book Nook Kit0See it at AmazonTechnically, there is an official Lord of the Rings book nook you can buy, but it's actually a LEGO set. The LEGO version is a recreation of Gandalf taking on the Balrog in that epic "You shall not pass" moment from the books and movies. But that LEGO set will cost you $130. If you're interested in the idea of building an LotR book nook of your own that won't destroy your budget, I recommend checking out this knock-off version on Amazon. It comes complete with a ring, and nice little scene, and LED lighting. If you ignore the fact that it says 'Spirit Valley of Magic Rings' on the side then you're golden.There are actually a ton of cool book nook puzzle kits out there, but none of them are licensed to specific IP in the same way other puzzles are.Tips for Choosing the Best Puzzle for YouIf you're fairly new to puzzles or are looking to purchase one as a gift for someone else, there are a few things you'll need to consider before you buy, even for Lord of the Rings puzzles.How many pieces is it?You can determine how difficult a jigsaw puzzle will be based on a few factors. The first and most obvious question to ask is how many pieces is it? A 100-piece puzzle is more ideal for kids or beginners, a 500-piece puzzle is great for intermediate puzzlers, and a 5,000-piece puzzle is a true undertaking. If you want a relaxing puzzle you can do in an afternoon or with a young kid, you should stick to 300 pieces or less.What size is it?Another important thing to consider is how much room it's going to take up. Even smaller puzzles can be pretty big and if you don't have room for it on your table, it's going to be hard (or even impossible) to put together. This is especially true for larger puzzles that will take days to complete; the table where you eat meals might not be its ideal home if it's going to take up the whole thing. This is where a decent puzzle board or mat can really make a difference.Roll-up StorageBecko Puzzle Mat33See it at AmazonUp to 1000 piecesRavensburger Puzzle-Store Storage21See it at AmazonIncludes 6 DrawersPlayVibe Puzzle Locker23See it at AmazonTitls and rollsAll4Jig Puzzle Table19See it at AmazonWhat does the picture look like?The last thing to consider is the actual image itself. Obviously you want to choose a puzzle of something you like, but you should also consider the composition of the image itself – certain qualities will make the puzzle more of a headache to put together than others. Do the colors blend together? Is there a lot of empty space? Puzzles with more unique elements will be easier to put together than something with a bunch of clear blue sky, for example.Looking for more great puzzles?
