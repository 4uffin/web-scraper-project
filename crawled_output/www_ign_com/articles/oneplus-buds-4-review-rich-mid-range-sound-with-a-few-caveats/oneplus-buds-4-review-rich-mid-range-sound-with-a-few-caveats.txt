They're moderately priced and jammed with extra features – and last year's Buds Pro 3 fixed some audio issues for clean, booming sound. The new OnePlus Buds 4 try to follow that same trend. They have lots of party tricks – specifically tuned sound profiles, 3D spatial audio, adaptive switching between noise cancelling and transparency mode – for a reasonable price. They're $129.99/£119.99 on paper but you may find them around $100/£100 if you buy them directly from OnePlus. So has OnePlus done it again, or are the Buds 4 a rare misstep?OnePlus Buds 4 - PhotosView 9 ImagesOnePlus Buds 4 – Design and Battery LifeThe OnePlus Buds 4 look disappointingly generic with its pebble-shaped. From end to end, it's larger than most cases but it is, at least, thin enough that I could slip it into my pocket without it bulging out from my clothes. The lid shuts with a loud, satisfying snap, but it will creak and wiggle from side to side if you push it. After my few weeks of testing I noticed some minor scuffs and scratches on the surface: it's certainly not flimsy, but it doesn't feel premium.The earbuds have a lick more personality, with a curved indented touch area on the side and metal-effect circle near the bottom of the stems. More importantly, they’re light yet they have a snug fit so they don’t dislodge, even when I was running. They come with rubberized tips of varying sizes for your ears, but the default ones felt comfortable – I wore them for hours without needing to take a break. IP55 certification shows they're water and dust resistant (although not waterproof). Not every set of mid-range earbuds can say that, and I wore the Buds 4 in the rain and during sweaty workouts without worrying.The touch controls mostly work well, consistently recognizing my gestures. Furthermore, the customization of single, double, and triple taps is generous, like all of the customization for the Buds 4. (I'll talk about the OnePlus HeyMelody app later in this review in more detail). Sliding your finger up and down for volume control feels intuitive, but it was fiddly at first. It was too easy for my finger to slip off the stem of the bud or to midjudge the angle, which often registered as a tap, pausing my music. It was fine once I got used to it, though.Battery life is about average and I got between five and a half and six hours of continuous use from a full charge while using active noise cancellation (ANC), which is perfectly acceptable at this price. The case will recharge your buds three times before you need to plug it in, which adds up to somewhere between 22 and 24 hours of play with ANC enabled between plug-ins, or about 45 hours without ANC. While not particularly spectacular, these are good numbers. It lacks wireless charging, however: I can't ding it too hard for that but some similarly priced buds have it, such as the JBL Live Pro 2 TWS. It does, however, charge quickly, and 10 minutes was enough for several hours of juice. More importantly, the audio quality, and the flood of customization available, is where the Buds 4 starts to shine.OnePlus Buds 4 – Audio Quality and Noise CancellationFor the price, the Buds 4 sound excellent. I tested them on a variety of music genres as well as podcasts, films, audio books, and live sports, and they sounded loud, balanced, and natural. They are slightly bass heavy, and in some songs it nearly drowned out other elements, but it never ruined anything for me (and it’s quite easy to adjust the EQ in its software to tune it to your liking). Remember that these are mid-range earbuds, so audiophiles looking for the absolute best sound quality will need to spend more money – but you can still feel the thump on bassy songs, the crisp splash of cymbals or snare drums. Vocals, whether sung or spoken, sound rich and true to life.They support Low Latency High-Definition Audio Codec (LHDC), a technology that can stream high-resolution audio over Bluetooth, which can give you more detailed sound. Most mid-range buds don't have this, so it feels like a bonus. You'll need a compatible Android device – the list is quite small, but includes OnePlus' phones – and a streaming service that supports hi-res audio, such as Tidal (Spotify doesn't), so whether you notice the benefit depends on other factors you may or may not have access to.Fundamentally, these are solid earbuds that make music, podcasts, and films sound fantastic.“Noise cancellation is impressive. You can adjust its strength to block out more or less sound, or let it adjust automatically. I mostly left it on maximum because I only used it when I wanted to hear as little background noise as possible. My ultimate ANC test is a particularly screechy section of the London Underground, and while the Buds 4 couldn't drown out the squeal of the tracks completely, it cut more than most other earbuds I've used. At the gym, it blocked out all the public music so I could hear my own without having to crank the volume up, and when I was listening to an audiobook in a cafe, it drowned out all background conversations.On the other end of noise control is transparency mode, which uses the built-in mics to boost external noise. This worked just as well as the noise cancelling: I used it for safety when walking on busy roads, or at home, when I was working but still wanted to hear people around me. It only amplified meaningful sounds, and the background fuzziness you sometimes get with transparency modes is absent here.Between noise cancelling and transparency modes sits one of the Buds 4's flagship features: an adaptive mode which flicks between the two depending on your background noise. I love the idea of just choosing one setting and never having to think about it again, but it's just not good enough to do that. The change between the two can feel abrupt, but my bigger complaint is that it's too stingy with the noise cancelling. In my gym it resisted adapting to the blaring background music where ANC would’ve been the right switch: I could hear every line of every song, interfering with what I was listening to. I admire the ambition, and hopefully OnePlus can improve on it next time.What's most important when buying gaming earbuds?Sound qualityComfort and fitPriceDurabilityMicrophone qualityNoise cancellationAnswerSee ResultsOnePlus Buds 4 – Software and CustomizationAll of the Buds 4's many tools and tricks are built into OnePlus phones, but for everyone else they're in the HeyMelody app. It failed to realize my buds were connected a couple of times, but the problem never lasted long and the app worked fine on the whole. It's simple, easy to navigate, and devoid of annoying pop-ups. It's pleasingly packed with ways to tune the sound of the Buds to your taste. Dimming bass, for example, is simple with BassWave. It's a sliding scale that lets you remove bass or, if you want, crank it up to absurd levels. At maximum it sounds forced and unnatural, but if you're gentle it works well. One of the Buds 4's other signatures is the grandly titled Golden Sound which claims to test your ears and tune sounds specifically to your "ear canal structure." It seems futuristic but most of the testing is moving a slider until you can no longer hear a series of beeps. Based on my results, it told me it would amplify frequencies at the mid-range. I was skeptical, but I must admit music did sound fuller and more vibrant afterwards. When I turned it off, it sounded flatter. If you don't like the results you can add a custom six-element equalizer, giving you precise control over the sound profile you want.There's no denying that this is a generous toolset for mid-range buds.“And then there's OnePlus 3D audio, which I liked less. Turning this on should make you feel like you're surrounded by noise – for music, it sounded different with louder vocals, but I can't say it sounded more immersive. For podcasts, it sounded more like a studio with a little more reverb, which I liked but also had some strange artifacts and wonky noise levels. Ultimately, I left it off.Whether you enjoy any of these options or not, there's no denying that this is a generous toolset for mid-range buds. Most people will, I think, like the default sound, but if you don't, you're almost guaranteed to find a combination of adjustments that work for you. And there are a few more peripheral extras, too. Dual connection lets you connect to two devices at once, so I could flip between watching YouTube on my laptop and my phone instantly without having to disconnect and/or reconnect. AI translation instantly translates foreign languages for you, but it's specific to OnePlus phones.I wasn't impressed by Gaming Mode, which reduces latency when you're playing phone games. I tried it in PUBG Mobile, but the sound of gunshots still lagged behind the on-screen action, although some have reported it works better with OnePlus phones. If you want the best gaming earbuds, you're still going to need something specifically designed for it with proper low-latency modes whether it be a robust wireless protocol or a 2.4GHz receiver.Purchasing GuideThe Buds 4 have an MSRP of $129.99/£119.99. You may be able to find the gray or green versions for $99.99/£99.99 directly from the OnePlus site in the US or UK. In the US they're also available on Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy and other retailers. In the UK, they're £99.99 on Amazon, or even cheaper for the green variant.Originally posted: Sep 15, 2025 11:28 pmVerdictSome of the OnePlus Buds 4's biggest new features – including its adaptive noise mode and spatial 3D audio – are letdowns. But fundamentally, these are solid earbuds that make music, podcasts, and films sound fantastic, and a generous suite of settings almost guarantee that you'll enjoy using them. They fit in the ear well and the gesture controls are largely intuitive. For the price, the OnePlus Buds 4’s should be in consideration if you want solid earbuds that won’t break the bank.In This ArticleOnePlus Buds 4OnePlus8Review scoringgreatThe OnePlus Buds 4 sound fantastic and boast great noise cancellation for the price, even if some of the flashier features are disappointing.Samuel HortiMore Reviews by Samuel Horti8Pulsar Susanto-X Gaming Mouse Review – Hot Pink Design, Fiery Performance9HyperX Pulsefire Haste 2 Mini Review – Our Favorite Compact Gaming Mouse So Far9Razer Deathadder V4 Pro Gaming Mouse Review – Razer's Best YetReviews•Editor Columns•News•Guides•Upcoming Sales Events•How to Watch Guides•Board Game Reviews•GTA 5 Cheats•Best Streaming Bundles•IGN Store•Top Deals•Contact Us•IGN YouTube•HowLongToBeat•IGN TikTok•IGN Twitter•Map Genie•Eurogamer•Rock Paper Shotgun•VG247•Maxroll•Privacy Policy•Terms of Use
