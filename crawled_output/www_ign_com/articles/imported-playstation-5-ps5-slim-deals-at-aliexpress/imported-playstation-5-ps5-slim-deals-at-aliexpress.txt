You'll also be able to select English as your default language just like any console you buy here. Keep in mind that imported consoles have an overseas warranty that won't be honored here in the United States. Fortunately, AliExpress has a 90-day free return policy and guarantees a refund if your order doesn't arrive within 20 days.Save Up to $130 Off Brand New PlayStation 5 Slim DealsImport ModelSony PlayStation 5 Slim Disc Edition Console1$549.99 save 23%$425.16 at AliExpressUse code 'USDEAL100'Import ModelSony PlayStation 5 Digital Edition Console8$449.99 save 18%$369.73 at AliExpressUse code 'AEUS80'Get 30% cashback on all purchases at AliExpress (from RetailMeNot)This week only, our sister site RetailMeNot is offering an extra 30% off cashback on all purchases at AliExpress up to $50 in maximum rewards. You can cap out the $50 savings from this purchase alone. All you have to do is head over to RetailMeNot and click on the tile to activate it. Then proceed to shop at AliExpress and your cashback savings will automatically be applied. RetailMeNot is reputable; your cashback earnings are deposited into your RetailMeNot account, and then you can transfer that balance to PayPal or Venmo and treat it like cash.Note that although the console itself is region unlocked, the Astro Bot or Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 digital download vouchers included in these console bundles are region locked.
