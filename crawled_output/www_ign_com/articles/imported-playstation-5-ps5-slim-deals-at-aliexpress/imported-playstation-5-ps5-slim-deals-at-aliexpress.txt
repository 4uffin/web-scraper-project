Then proceed to shop at AliExpress and your cashback savings will automatically be applied. RetailMeNot is reputable; your cashback earnings are deposited into your RetailMeNot account, and then you can transfer that balance to PayPal or Venmo and treat it like cash.Note that although the console itself is region unlocked, the Astro Bot or Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 digital download vouchers included in these console bundles are region locked.
