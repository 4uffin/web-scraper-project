During an Entertainment Tonight interview, the Traitors host was asked whether Berry was also returning for Marvel's upcoming Avengers: Doomsday, alongside Cumming and a swathe of other actors from past X-Men films. "Well... maybe she does," Cumming teased, laughing. "But honestly, I'm the last person to ask," he quickly added.This isn't the first (or second) time that Cumming has teased Avengers: Doomsday details that Marvel might have otherwise kept under wraps. Last month, the actor revealed he shot "the entire film in isolation" and said he had now wrapped up his scenes early to go off and film the next season of The Traitors. Back in May, the ever-chatty Cumming sparked speculation around Doomsday's plot by saying he had filmed a fight sequence battling Reed Richards actor Pedro Pascal — something he later attempted to walk back by suggesting he was now unsure. ("I broke the internet by mentioning something once," Cumming said last month, "but honestly, I might have got it wrong.")Alan Cumming when asked if Halle Berry will be reprising her role as Storm for ‘AVENGERS: DOOMSDAY’“Well… maybe she does.”(via @etnow) pic.twitter.com/IGjf4IsHMx— Avengers Updates (@AvengersUpdated) September 16, 2025 Avengers: Doomsday will see the return of numerous X-Men actors from 20th Century Fox's older mutant movies. Cumming is expected to share screen time with Patrick Stewart's Professor X, Kelsey Grammer's Beast, James Marsden's Cyclops, Rebecca Romijn's Mystique, Ian McKellen's Magneto — and potentially other cast members that Cumming is yet to tease. Berry played Ororo Munroe, better known as Storm, in 2000's X-Men, before returning for X2, X-Men: The Last Stand and X-Men: Days of Future Past. Berry herself has previously cast doubt on her return in Doomsday, and addressed whether should be part of a second big chair reveal. "Well, keep waiting," she told a reporter, when asked if her name would be shown. "It's not gonna be there."Doomsday is expected to offer fans a final farewell for the old X-Men cast, ahead of Marvel's own upcoming reboot. Following the events of Avengers: Secret Wars, MCU boss Kevin Feige has said that a semi-rebooted timeline will see a new, younger X-Men team come to the fore, in a fresh X-Men movie set to be directed by Thunderbolts*/The New Avengers' Jake Schreier. Here's hoping Cumming gets invited back for that to tell us all more.Image credit: Raymond Hall/GC Images.Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
