The overall TV slate is so good lately that a few shows ended up breaking some awards records during the ceremony. Seth Rogan’s hit new comedy The Studio won a whopping 12 awards this year, including nine at the Creative Arts Emmys last weekend — which allowed it to break the record for most wins in a single season. The record was previously held by The Bear, which won 11 awards for its second season during last year’s ceremony.The new Apple TV+ comedy also surpassed The Bear’s record for most wins in a show’s first season. The FX dramedy won 10 Emmys during its first season, while The Studio blew past that number between both ceremonies.

The underrated actress, who is also an accomplished Broadway performer, won Best Actress in a Limited or Anthology Series for her work as Sofia Falcone in the HBO drama The Penguin. This is Milioti’s first Emmy nomination and also her first win.Cristin Milioti accepts the Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie award for The Penguin.

The drama dominated the Los Angeles ceremony, scooping up six trophies, including Britt Lower winning Best Actress in a Drama Series.The Pitt also beat mega-hits like Severance and The White Lotus to scoop up the award for best drama, with Noah Wyle winning Best Actor in a Drama, but Severance didn't walk away empty handed, picking up two major awards.Overall, there were nine wins for The Penguin, including Outstanding Prosthetic Makeup, and five wins for The Pitt, including Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series (Katherine LaNasa), Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series (Shawn Hatosy), and Outstanding Casting for a Drama Series. The Last of Us had one win, for Outstanding Sound Editing for a Comedy or Drama Series (One Hour).Owen Cooper accepts the Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie award for Adolescence.
