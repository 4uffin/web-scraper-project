A single set of this size and scope would be impractically large and prohibitively expensive. So instead, LEGO is releasing numerous smaller sets that, when combined, will form the full castle. It's a truly massive undertaking.This is an ongoing project; LEGO has not announced the end date for the final set. But based on their current pace, it's going to be years before the project finally wraps.We've been building the LEGO Hogwarts Castle since it launched, and we will continue building and adding to it until it's complete. If you would like to do the same? it's not too late to start, although LEGO will retire several key sets at the end of the year.Here is every set released so far that comprises the modular LEGO Hogwarts Castle, currently in progress. We've included a grand piece count and price count at the bottom, which we will update as the castle continues to grow. Lastly, we took and included some photos of the castle as it currently stands, so you can see its current progression.LEGO Harry Potter: Hogwarts Castle SetsLEGO Hogwarts Castle: Owlery2$44.99 save 20%$35.99 at AmazonLEGO Hogwarts Castle: Boathouse2$37.99 save 18%$30.99 at AmazonLEGO Hogwarts Castle: Potions Class3$39.90 save 15%$33.99 at AmazonLEGO Hogwarts Castle: The Great Hall1$199.99 at AmazonLEGO Hogwarts Castle: Dueling Club1$24.99 save 14%$21.49 at AmazonLEGO Hogwarts Castle: Charms Class1$19.96 at AmazonLEGO Hogwarts Castle: Flying Lessons1$79.99 at AmazonLEGO Hogwarts Castle: Herbology Class2$49.99 at AmazonLEGO Hogwarts Castle: The Main Tower6$259.99 at Amazon$259.99 at LEGO StoreThese are the sets you'll need to buy if you want to create your own enormous LEGO version of Hogwarts Castle. But these are just the sets released to date – more will be added in the future.Hogwarts Castle: OwlerySet: #76430Piece Count: 364Price: $44.99Primary Book/Movie Inspiration: Harry Potter and the Goblet of FireLaunch Date: March 1, 2024Status: Available at AmazonThe Owlery is the first component of the Hogwarts Castle. If you're looking to cut a corner or two and save on costs, you might start with this one, because it's an independent structure apart from the main building. It has winter-themed, snow-capped spires, so if you're after aesthetic consistency, you might also want to swap out a few pieces to make the Owlery match seasons with the rest of the castle.Hogwarts Castle: BoathouseSet: #76426Piece Count: 350Price: $37.99Primary Book/Movie Inspiration: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's StoneLaunch Date: March 1, 2024Status: Available at AmazonBoth the Boathouse and the Owlery share the same gray-colored hue on their spires. Back in 2024, this led many LEGO fans to speculate that these sets marked the beginning of a new Hogwarts Castle, even though it hadn't been officially announced yet. The Boathouse includes two small wooden boats, so you can recreate Harry's first-year arrival at Hogwarts.Hogwarts Castle: Potions ClassSet: #76431Piece Count: 397Price: $39.99Primary Book/Movie Inspiration: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's StoneLaunch Date: June 1, 2024Status: Available at AmazonThis is the first Hogwarts classroom set, which can swap in to replace another room in the castle. To use an example: The Great Hall comes with the girl's bathroom in the dungeon, where the troll attacks Hermione in the first book/movie. It's nice looking diorama, but it's extremely scene specific, and it doesn't really fit in with the rest of the castle. So, if you want to, you can swap out the troll scene with Professor Snape's Potions Classroom, which is a lot more detailed and colorful, and contains a wider range of roleplay opportunities. If you don't get the Potions Classroom, it's not going to look, at least outwardly, like something's missing. But still, it's hard to imagine Hogwarts without it.Hogwarts Castle: The Great HallSet: #76435Piece Count: 1732Price: $199.99Primary Book/Movie Inspiration: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's StoneLaunch Date: June 1, 2024Status: Available at AmazonThe first major 'essential' building block in the Hogwarts Castle, the Great Hall includes the eponymous Hall – where the Sorting Ceremonies and Start and End-of-Term Feasts take place – and three additional rooms: the girl's bathroom where the troll attacked Hermione; a narrow corridor; and the Hufflepuff Common Room. The Great Hall connects to the Boathouse at the bottom of the outer stairwell; connects to the Main Tower at its side; and can swap its bathroom with the Potions Classroom. We built and photographed this one at the time of its launch.Hogwarts Castle: Dueling ClubSet: #76441Piece Count: 158Price: $24.99Primary Book/Movie Inspiration: Harry Potter and the Chamber of SecretsLaunch Date: January 1, 2025Status: Available at AmazonThis set recreeates the Dueling Club scene from Chamber of Secrets, in which Draco conjures a snake and Harry uses Parseltongue to stop it from attacking Justin Finch-Fletchley. There's a gimmicked floor in the table that makes the minifigures fly backwards off of it. If you want, you can swap out the house tables in the Great Hall with the Dueling Club table. It's a fun alternative, but overall inessential to the larger castle, if that's what you're going for.Hogwarts Castle: Charms ClassSet: #76442Piece Count: 204Price: $19.99Primary Book/Movie Inspiration: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's StoneLaunch Date: January 1, 2025Status: Available at AmazonProfessor Flitwick's Charms Classroom lets you recreate the Wingardium Leviosa scene from the first book/movie ("It's Levi-O-sa! Not Levio-SA."). The Professor Flitwick minifigure has his original movie appearance, when the filmmakers leaned into his goblin hertitage. The Charms Classroom slots into the Flying Lessons set, and can swap with the Quidditch equipment room.Hogwarts Castle: Flying LessonsSet: #76447Piece Count: 651Price: $79.99Primary Book/Movie Inspiration: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's StoneLaunch Date: January 1, 2025Status: Available at AmazonOn the exterior, this set depicts the scene where Harry rides a broom for the first time (it even includes a minifigure of Madame Hooch). But on the interior, this is a Professor McGonagall-centric set. It includes the aforementioned Quidditch equipment room, but it also contains McGonagall's office and McGonagall's Transfiguration classroom. The Flying Lessons set doesn't connect to any of the current sets; it'll fit in later, once we have more of the Castle completed.Hogwarts Castle: Herbology ClassSet: #76445Piece Count: 390Price: $49.99Primary Book/Movie Inspiration: Harry Potter and the Chamber of SecretsLaunch Date: June 1, 2025Status: Available at AmazonThe Herbology Classroom includes a rare Professor Sprout minifigure, plus Hermione and Neville in their greenhouse smocks and gloves. The greenhouse feels appropriately overgrown and busy, with three mandrake plants and accompanying earmuff accessories. It is a freestanding structure from the larger Hogwarts Castle, although unlike the Owlery, it'll be in close proximity to it.Hogwarts Castle: The Main TowerSet: #76454Piece Count: 2135Price: $259.99Primary Book/Movie Inspiration: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's StoneLaunch Date: June 1, 2025Status: Available at Amazon and LEGO StoreThe second major Hogwarts Castle set, the Main Tower connects directly to the Great Hall on its right side. And taken together (see more photos below), you really get a sense of size and scope. The interior contains three of the rooms from the Sorcerer's Stone trials: the Devil's Snare room, the Flying Keys room, and the Chess Set room. One floor up is Fluffy's room and a narrow corridor. One floor up from that is the Gryffindor Common Room. And then the actual Main Tower contains three staircases (two of them rotate), Dumbledore's office, and a secret room containing the Mirror of Erised. We built and photographed this set at launch.Hogwarts Castle: Room of RequirementSet: #40770Piece Count: 202Price: $19.99Primary Book/Movie Inspiration: Harry Potter and the Deathly HallowsLaunch Date: September 1, 2025Status: Unavailable, limited time gift-with-purchaseThis may end up being the rarest set in the whole modular collection. This re-creation of the Room of Requirement, as seen in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, includes hammocks and sleeping arrangements for Dumbledore's Army members. It comes with a single minifigure of Neville Longbottom.The above price of $19.99 is what LEGO listed on their website. It was, however, never on sale by itself; rather, it was a gift-with-purchase for anyone who bought $130 worth of Harry Potter LEGO in the first week of September 2025. Your best bet is the secondary market, but don't break the bank over it; it's an an optional classroom that slots into the Main Tower, rather than a standing structure by itself.For photos of the entire Hogwarts Castle build so far, see below.What's The Current Total Piece Count?The current total piece count stands at 6,583.What's The Current Total Price?The current total price stands at $777.90.What's Next?Right prior to releasing the Owlery, LEGO released an architectural build of Hogwarts Castle in miniature form. It has the same grey spires as the modular castle, and because of its timing, my theory is that it is a rough blueprint for how the final castle will look.Above, I've circled the parts of the modular castle that have been released. So you can see we have quite a bit (close to two-thirds) of the final building to go. Maybe the Viaduct Bridge that leads from the Great Hall to the Central Hall is next? That would be a smaller set. And then, it's likely that the Central Hall would be the next major build after that. But that's all pure speculation. We'll have to wait and see.Be sure to check out our lists of the best Star Wars LEGO sets and best Harry Potter LEGO sets.
