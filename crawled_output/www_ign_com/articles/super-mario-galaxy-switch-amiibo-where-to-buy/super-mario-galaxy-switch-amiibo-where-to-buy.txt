One of the surprise announcements, in addition to a Mario Movie sequel, was that a new collection of Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2 is coming to Switch. And as we all know, one certainty in life is that when a new Switch game comes out, amiibo figures are sure to follow. Featured in this articleOut April 2, 2026Mario and Luma amiibo3$39.99 at TargetOut April 2, 2026Rosalina and Lumas amiibo4$39.99 at TargetOut November 25Rosalina's Storybook (Hardcover)2$24.99 at WalmartOut October 2Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 246$69.99 at AmazonTo that end, Nintendo is releasing two new Super Mario Galaxy amiibo. One is Mario and Luma. The other is Rosalina and Lumas. And despite that the game they accompany is out October 2, these figures aren’t out until April 2, 2026 – a day before the movie hits theaters. They available for preorder for $39.99 each, but they’ve already sold out at Amazon and Walmart. (They may come back into stock, but then again, they may not). Here’s where you can still get them.Mario and Luma amiiboOut April 2, 2026Mario and Luma amiibo3$39.99 at TargetGet it at Target - $39.99Get it at Best Buy - $39.99Get it at GameStop - $39.99Get it at Amazon - SOLD OUTGet it at Walmart - SOLD OUTScan it into the game, and the Mario and Luma amiibo grants you a life mushroom that will refill your health, and even give you an extra three blocks of health.As for the amiibo itself, it's bigger than most previous amiibo (hence the higher price tag), plus it's kind of perfect? Mario’s flying pose calls back to the cover of the Super Mario Galaxy. But it also includes a round patch of grassy earth as a base, just like the little planetoids you run around on in the game. And there’s a Luma character and a Launch Star. In that one amiibo figure, you get the gist of what the whole game is about. Pretty cool if you ask me.Rosalina and Lumas amiiboOut April 2, 2026Rosalina and Lumas amiibo4$39.99 at TargetGet it at Target - $39.99Get it at Best Buy - $39.99Get it at GameStop - SOLD OUTGet it at Amazon - SOLD OUTGet it at Walmart - SOLD OUTScan the Rosalina and Lumas amiibo in the game, and you'll get a 1-Up mushroom, which always comes in handy. The figure depicts the princess in her traditional blue dress, sitting in a chair and reading her storybook, with two Lumas gathered round.Rosalina's Storybook (Hardcover)Out November 25Rosalina's Storybook (Hardcover)2$24.99 at WalmartGet it at Walmart - $24.99Get it at Barnes & Noble - $24.99Get it at Books-A-Million - $24.99Get it at Amazon - SOLD OUTSpeaking of, you can preorder a real-life hardcover version of Rosalina’s Storybook . It was also available at Amazon, but – you guessed it – it’s already sold out.Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2Out October 2Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 246$69.99 at AmazonWhile we’re at it, you might as well preorder Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2 if you haven’t already. It’s a collection of two absolute bangers from the Wii era. These were generally considered the best 3D Mario games until Odyssey came along, and they still absolutely hold up. The game is out soon, too, on October 2.Rosalina & Luma amiibo (Super Smash Bros. Series) ReprintOut October 2Rosalina & Luma amiibo (Super Smash Bros. Series)0$19.99 at TargetFinally, and somewhat confusingly, Nintendo is reprinting the Rosalina & Luma amiibo that came out several years ago in the Super Smash Bros. series. It's not a new amiibo, but it's available for preorder with an October 2 release date, and it's roughly $10 cheaper than you'll find it anywhere else.How to Follow IGN Deals RecommendationsThe IGN Deals team has over 30 years of combined experience finding the best discounts and preorders available online.
