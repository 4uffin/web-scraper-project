In fact, prices have actually increased this year. Starting at $500 for the PS5 Slim and $649 for the PS5 Pro, it is a purchase you will need to plan for. If you want to play titles like Stellar Blade and Astro Bot, it's a purchase worth making. Beyond games, the PS5 is also great for streaming 4K content to your TV. Luckily, you can find some discounts or bundles on PlayStation 5 consoles throughout the year if you know when to look. Whether you're looking for the PS5 Slim or the more powerful PS5 Pro, we've compiled the best times you can buy a PlayStation 5 throughout 2025 and beyond. From holidays to sales events, there are quite a few opportunities to pick up the console. Each retailer offers different deals and discounts, but we've outlined the events you need to pay attention to. The best time to buy a PlayStation 5 is when it is discounted or bundled with a free game, so keep these sale event dates in mind to get the best deal possible.Note: With ongoing uncertainty surrounding U.S. tariffs, now may be the best time to buy video game hardware and accessories. If you find a good deal on a new or refurbished console, it's potentially worth buying before any more price increases occur.When Should You Buy a PS5?Black Friday and Cyber MondayOverall, your best bet to purchase a discounted PlayStation 5 is Black Friday or Cyber Monday. The annual holidays occur just after Thanksgiving in November, with Black Friday 2025 currently set for November 28. This event mainly refers to in-store deals, with major retailers like Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy, and Target participating. Some of the best PlayStation 5 offers will only be available in stores on Black Friday.The other major sales event alongside Black Friday is Cyber Monday. This event is set annually on the Monday following Black Friday, which is Monday, December 2 this year. Cyber Monday focuses on electronics and is exclusively available online. Following last year, we expect to see major PlayStation 5 deals on this day. Nowadays, the Black Friday sales event extends from a few weeks before Black Friday to a few weeks after, which ultimately spans the entire holiday season. Major PlayStation 5 bundles are usually up for purchase around this time of year, so you can expect great discounts alongside dozens of discounted PS5 games. If you are operating on a budget for the PlayStation 5 consoles and games together, Black Friday is the best time of year by far to pick up a console. Amazon Prime DayPrime Day is also an excellent time to purchase a PlayStation 5 every year. Alongside this, many PS5 games are likely to be priced low as part of the sale, so you can pick up more games as well. Other retailers besides Amazon will also hold sales around Prime Day, so this only increases the chance that a PlayStation 5 deal will be available. Sometimes, this means an extended 4th of July sale or a surprise weekend sale. If you're not in a rush to purchase a PS5, Prime Day is a great time to buy one.Prime Big Deal DaysThe Prime Big Deal Days sale is a sort of second Amazon Prime Day that will sometimes have discounts on consoles. It isn't quite as big as Prime Day, but it's a similar Prime-exclusive event that has had traditionally had some pretty good gaming deals since it first began back in 2022. Amazon recently announced the dates of the sale, which will take place on October 7-8 this year.Around Major ReleasesSony tends to make console bundles for some of its major releases. This also extends to third-party exclusives like Final Fantasy XVI. Sony tends to discount these PlayStation 5 bundles around the releases of major titles, as it incentivizes customers to pick up a system and check out the new game. Additionally, you can find these PS5 bundles on sale once the included game has been out for a few months, as Sony looks to clear inventory of the bundle. Previous bundles included a copy of Spider-Man 2 or NBA 2K25, with the most recent bundle including Call of Duty: Black Ops 6.Throughout the SummerAnother great time to buy a PlayStation 5 is summer. Following the major gaming events like Summer Game Fest, Sony and other companies usually hold sales events to celebrate the summer This includes deals on games, accessories, controllers, and consoles, which includes PlayStation 5. The PlayStation Summer Sale usually starts around July and runs through August, making it a great time to buy video games as well. Though this year's Days of Play sale has already come to an end.Late summer is also a great time, as retailers tend to begin preparations for the Fall season. Inventory on older console models is cleared, leading the way for new bundles. PlayStation 5 consoles and other items will likely be available discounted at this time.Should You Get a PlayStation 5 Pro? Nowadays, consoles tend to last anywhere from six to eight years. The PlayStation 5 released in November of 2020, meaning we're already over five years into the cycle of this generation. As such, it's worth noting that you may want to think about purchasing the PS5 Pro instead.PlayStation 5 Pro58$699.00 at AmazonThe PlayStation 5 Pro was released in November 2024 and features upgraded internals. The PS5 Pro release led to discounts on the existing PS5, including a $70 discount on the PS5 Slim over the holidays. If you're happy with the capabilities and game releases on the PS5, keeping an eye out for more price drops is probably one of the most budget-friendly ways to grab a new console. If you want a console that's prepped and ready for the next generation of games, it may be worth waiting for Black Friday discounts and bundles on the PS5 Pro. PlayStation 5 Slim1The PS5 isn't just one of the best game consoles ever, but it'll also play all your Blu-Rays.See it at AmazonNoah Hunter is a freelance writer and reviewer with a passion for games and technology.
