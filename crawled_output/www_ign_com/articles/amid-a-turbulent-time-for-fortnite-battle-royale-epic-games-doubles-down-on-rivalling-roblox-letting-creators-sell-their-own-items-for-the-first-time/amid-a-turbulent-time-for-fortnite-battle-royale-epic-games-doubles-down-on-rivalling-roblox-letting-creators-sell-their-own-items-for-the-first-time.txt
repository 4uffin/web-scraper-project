The announcement comes at an interesting time for Fortnite as a whole, which has seen lower than average player numbers for its core battle royale modes over the summer. At the same time, Roblox's player count has spiked thanks to trending hits like Grow a Garden and Steal a Brainrot.Now, Epic Games is doubling down on encouraging creators to its platform, after several weekends where a Fortnite version of Steal a Brainrot soared in popularity. Next up for Fortnite's third-party offerings will be the ability to sell items directly, with a better cut of the sales than in Roblox handed over to creators. In a blog post on the announcement, Epic Games highlighted that it will hand over 50% of the V-Bucks value of purchases made in third-party experiences after store/platform fees, raised to 100% through the program's first year (until December 31, 2026). Taking those store/platform fees into account, that translates to creators earning 37% of in-game sales, doubled to 74% for the first year. In comparison, as Epic Games itself points out, Roblox offers 25%.The message here is clear: come launch your game on Fortnite's platform and you'll earn more money per dollar spent — and considerably more to start off with. It's a similar tactic to one Epic Games has used before, to encourage developers onto its Epic Game Store rather than Steam. But it's worth remembering that, while a better percentage, Fortnite's player numbers are far below those of Roblox — meaning that while creators might earn less per dollar spent, they may still see far more money made.Fortnite's creator payout percentages for in-game item sales.

Here, it feels like Epic Games is clearly pushing creator content as a way to widen its audience further, rather than something that simply offers current players new things to do (another challenge it has faced over the past few months, with new additions in various battle royale offerings feeling like they're just shuffling existing players around modes).The push to highlight creator-made content will continue with the introduction of a "sponsored" block on Fortnite's main screen, Discover, where creators will be able to pay Epic Games for placement. Long-term, Epic says it will use 50% of this revenue for its creator engagment payouts, though this will be boosted to 100% of the revenue for the first year. After that, Epic Games will keep the other 50%, for use covering server costs, safety and moderation tools, and R&D. "In recent years, Epic has been investing and operating the business at a loss," the company noted. Fortnite (green) and Roblox (red) player numbers over the past year.

Beginning on mobile and PC, players will be able to download a smaller version of Fortnite with just its popular Blitz Royale mode included, along with the ability to play creator-made games. Other modes — even including Fortnite's main battle royale — will then require additional downloads, if desired. It's a smart way to get people playing trending hits like Steal a Brainrot without requiring a larger download than necessary. But it's also feels like an eye-opening shift in priority for the company, and an acknowledgement Fortnite's core Epic-made modes may no longer be the game's hottest draw.Fortnite has changed repeatedly over the years, from PVE zombie experience to battle royale, to a metaverse-y platform full of other genres. And while Fortnite's next transformation isn't wholly unexpected — the percentage of players in creator-made modes has been rising for years — it feels like it may be its most dramatic yet. There's no suggestion that Fortnite battle royale is going away, of course, and there's good reason to think its lucrative battle passes and live events will stick around for a long time yet as a differentiator to other platforms, as well as a way to introduce more IP crossovers. But with the growing focus on creator-made content — and the sheer number of players now engaged with it across Fortnite and Roblox — the game's next era looks clear.Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
