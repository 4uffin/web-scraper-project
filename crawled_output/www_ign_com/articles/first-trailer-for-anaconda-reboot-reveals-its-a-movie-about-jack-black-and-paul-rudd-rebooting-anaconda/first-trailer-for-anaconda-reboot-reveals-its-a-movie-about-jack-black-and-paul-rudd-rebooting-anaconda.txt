Unfortunately, the pair can’t raise enough money to make the big budget reboot they want, so they have to do it on the cheap. As you’d expect, things do not go to plan.We see glimpses of the Anaconda itself attacking people, what looks like a certain kill moment, and Jack Black used as bait for the others to escape. Black, however, is very much alive.As well as Black and Rudd, Anaconda stars Steve Zahn, Thandiwe Newton, Daniela Melchior, and Selton Mello.Here’s the official blurb:Doug (Jack Black) and Griff (Paul Rudd) have been best friends since they were kids, and have always dreamed of remaking their all-time favourite movie: the cinematic "classic" Anaconda. When a midlife crisis pushes them to finally go for it, they head deep into the Amazon to start filming. But things get real when an actual giant anaconda appears, turning their comically chaotic movie set into a deadly situation. The movie they’re dying to make? It might just get them killed......1997’s Anaconda is a cult classic horror film starring Jennifer Lopez, Ice Cube, Jon Voight, Eric Stoltz, Jonathan Hyde, and Owen Wilson. It was ravaged by critics, but it performed well at the box office, grossing $136 million worldwide. A sequel, Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid, arrived in 2004, followed by three more made-for-television sequels.Anaconda Remake ImagesView 3 ImagesThis new Anaconda is a comedy.
