Equinox, which dates back to 1994 (I was 4, in case you were wondering, and didn’t know my Mana from my Modern Horizons), has seen a price hike.Magic: The Gathering Equinox1See it at TCGPlayerThe reason, as is often the case in recent weeks, is the upcoming Magic: The Gathering Avatar crossover set. This card protects your lands, which is lovely, and despite a lack of land removal in recent years (I did manage to pull off a very enjoyable Planetary Annihilation in a recent Commander session), it pairs nicely with the upcoming Toph, the First Metalbender, since it makes everything into lands.It’s going for $20, but the market value is around $5. Considering it was just $1.50 not long ago, it could climb higher for formats where it’s still legal.Magic: The Gathering The Soul Stone0See it at TCGPlayerIt’s not even here yet, but Magic’s hunt for the Infinity Stones has well and truly kicked off with The Soul Stone.The card taps for mana, which is neat, but by exiling a creature, you can ‘Harness’ the stone to pull a creature from your graveyard to your side of the field each turn. It’s up to $130 market value and isn’t even here yet.Magic: The Gathering Elspeth, Storm Slayer1See it at TCGPlayerTarkir Dragonstorm’s Elspeth, Storm Slayer is on the rise again. This Planeswalker can create tokens (and double them), add counters and flying, and offer targeted removal of big threats.She’s now over $30, having dipped to $24 in late June, and she’s not the only White spell from the set to see a climb.Magic: The Gathering Voice of Victory2See it at TCGPlayerVoice of Victory is up to a market value of $13.70, a 64% increase in a few weeks.CrashingVivi Ornitier has been dropping for some time, but he’s likely to tumble now. Why? Well, it seems Wizards of the Coast will follow through with the community’s request to ban the diminutive spellcaster from Standard.Magic: The Gathering Vivi Ornitier0See it at TCGPlayerMagic: The Gathering Summon: Bahamut0See it at TCGPlayerMagic: The Gathering Craterhoof Behemoth1See it at TCGPlayerMagic: The Gathering Exalted Sunborn2See it at TCGPlayerMagic: The Gathering Moonlit Meditation0See it at TCGPlayerHe’ll likely be gone in November 10’s next banwave, so have your fun while you can, Standard spellslingers.Magic: The Gathering Summon: Bahamut0See it at TCGPlayerSticking with Final Fantasy, Summon: Bahamut is on the way down, too. This powerful Saga Dragon is a 9/9 with removal, card draw, and a big ol’ potential game-ending attack all wrapped into one.It’s now just over $20, and I can see it being fun to pop into a dragon-themed deck.Magic: The Gathering Craterhoof Behemoth1See it at TCGPlayerI love Craterhoof Behemoth, and the big ol’ beast has seen another drop. It’s now sitting at a market value of around $11.50, a dollar or so below where it was just a couple of weeks ago. As a potential match-ender, it has plenty of utility in any deck with green.Magic: The Gathering Exalted Sunborn2See it at TCGPlayerFinally, two Edge of Eternities cards are plummeting, despite still being very useful. The first, Exalted Sunborn, is down to $18, having been $27 when the set launched. It offers a flying 4/5 with Lifelink that can double your tokens.Magic: The Gathering Moonlit Meditation0See it at TCGPlayerMoonlit Meditation is now just a dollar or so, and also doubles tokens once per turn, but turns them into copies of a chosen artifact or creature. It’s the kind of fun card that could lead to utter chaos, and it’s super cheap.Lloyd Coombes is an experienced freelancer in tech, gaming and fitness seen at Polygon, Eurogamer, Macworld, TechRadar and many more. He's a big fan of Magic: The Gathering and other collectible card games, much to his wife's dismay.Originally posted: Sep 15, 2025 5:00 pmIn This ArticleMagic: The Gathering Trading Card GameWizards of the CoastAug 30, 1993+1Rate this gameReviews•Editor Columns•News•Guides•Upcoming Sales Events•How to Watch Guides•Board Game Reviews•GTA 5 Cheats•Best Streaming Bundles•IGN Store•Top Deals•Contact Us•IGN YouTube•HowLongToBeat•IGN TikTok•IGN Twitter•Map Genie•Eurogamer•Rock Paper Shotgun•VG247•Maxroll•Privacy Policy•Terms of Use
