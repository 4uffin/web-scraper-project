This is easily the best deal I've seen for a Legion Tower RTX 5080 gaming PC and over $500 less than the previous lowest price. The RTX 5080 graphics card will play even the latest games at 4K resolution with high settings and ray tracing enabled.Lenovo Legion Tower 7i Gen 10 RTX 5080 Gaming PC for $2,149Lenovo Legion Tower 7i Gen 10 Intel Core Ultra 7 265K RTX 5080 Gaming PC (32GB/2TB)0$3,849.99 save 44%$2,149.00 at LenovoUse code 'WEEKENDPOWERUP'The Legion Tower 7 is Lenovo's top-end desktop computer, boasting a well-ventilated chassis with a mesh front panel housing six total 120mm fans (including three fans for the 360mm liquid cooling system) and an 850W 80Plus Gold power supply. This particular configuration features an Intel Core Ultra 7 265K processor, GeForce RTX 5080 16GB graphics card, 32GB of DDR5-5600MHz of RAM, and a 2TB PCIe Gen 4 M.2 SSD. The Intel Core Ultra 9 285K processor has a max turbo frequency of 5.7GHz with 24 cores and a 40MB L2 cache. According to Passmark, the Intel Core Ultra 7 265K is a better gaming chip than the previous generation's Intel Core i9-14900K.The RTX 5080 is the second best Blackwell graphics card, surpassed only by the $2,000 RTX 5090. It's about 5%-10% faster than the previous generation RTX 4080 Super, which is discontinued and no longer available. In games that support DLSS 4 with multi-frame generation exclusive to Blackwell cards, the gap widens. This is an outstanding card for playing even the latest games at 4K resolution with high settings and ray tracing enabled.Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 FE Review by Jacqueline Thomas"If you already have a high-end graphics card from the last couple of years, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 doesn’t make a lot of sense – it just doesn’t have much of a performance lead over the RTX 4080, though the extra frames from DLSS 4 Multi-Frame Generation do make things look better in games that support it. However, for gamers with an older graphics card who want a significant performance boost, the RTX 5080 absolutely provides – doubly so if you’re comfortable with Nvidia’s AI goodies."Why Choose Lenovo?Lenovo Legion gaming PCs and laptops generally feature better build quality than what you'd find from other prebuilt PCs. For desktop PCs in particular, people like the fact that Lenovo does not use proprietary components in its computer systems, so they're easier to upgrade with off-the-shelf parts. Although we haven't yet reviewed the new 2025 models, we have reviewed last year's Legion 7 desktop and really liked its build quality and performance.Lenovo Legion Tower 7i Review by Jacqueline Thomas"The Lenovo Legion Tower 7i is an incredibly powerful gaming PC, especially for the money you’re likely going to be paying for it. If all you want is a powerful, upgradeable machine without having to go through the trouble of building it yourself, it’s hard to find many gaming PCs better than this one. Just be sure to uninstall McAfee as soon as you boot it up."Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.
