Paramount+ has had a pretty significant sale on its annual plans this month. Until September 18 (tomorrow, by the way), both new and existing subscribers can save 50% on a full year of the plan of their choosing. You can either grab the Paramount+ Essential annual plan for $29.99 (regularly priced at $59.99), or the Paramount+ Premium annual plan for $59.99 (regularly priced at $119.99). 50% Off Annual Paramount+ Subscriptions for New and Returning Subscribers Available Until Sept 1850% Off Paramount+ 13Get one year of Paramount+ Essential for $29.99 (normally $59.99) or Paramount+ Premium for $59.99 (normally $119.99)See it at Paramount+Besides whether or not you get ads, the big difference between these plans is whether you care about the Showtime library, which includes the likes of Yellowjackets and Dexter: Resurrection. For context: What was previously the Paramount+ with Showtime package has been rebranded as the Premium subscription.The discount only applies to annual subscriptions, so no free trials and no big savings on the monthly plans. That said, a year of the ad-supported subscription at this price is what you would for about four months of the service on a monthly plan, which is still priced at $7.99/month. The Premium plan also continues to cost $12.99/month. Credit: ParamountUnlike most streaming deals these days, the discounts apply to both new and returning subscribers. So, if you do happen to be enjoying the monthly plan and have some extra cash, it’s well worth considering grabbing the annual discount as an upfront cost. What’s on Paramount+?Paramount has a bit of a unique library compared to the likes of Disney+ or Netflix, but I’d like to think there’s a little something for everyone in there. Right now, it’s where you’ll find new episodes of South Park the day after they air (and cause whatever controversy) as well as the new season of Star Trek: Strange New Worlds. The list of Paramount movies is pretty much endless, but some highlights there include Gladiator, the Transformers movies, and the Sonic the Hedgehog trilogy. The studio will also be developing the live-action Call of Duty movie. Paramount has been slowly expanding its live sports offerings. It's where you can watch the NFL on CBS as well as the UEFA Champions League. Most recently, the service signed a deal to acquire the streaming rights to the UFC franchise, which will be moving away from the PPV model used by ESPN starting in 2026. In other words, if you subscribe with the deal now, you’ll get to watch all the fights your heart desires next year.
