The Fantastic Four: First Steps has arrived on VOD and is now available to rent or purchase through digital marketplaces like Prime Video. The movie introduces the MCU’s iteration of the fantastic family, which happens to be the third Fantastic Four adaptation to date. (Not counting Oley Sassone's unreleased project from the '90s.)
Instead of starting with the Fantastic Four's origin story, First Steps launches us into the world of an established super-family about to welcome a new member. The problem: The cosmic threat known as Galactus has his own interest in the growing family. If you’re catching up on the MCU or just want to tune into the family-oriented superhero flick, here’s everything you need to know. The Fantastic Four: First Steps Arrives on Digital The Fantastic Four: First Steps0Set against the backdrop of a ’60s-inspired, retro-futuristic world, Marvel’s First Family faces a daunting challenge. Forced to balance being heroes with their family bond, they must defend Earth from a space god and his enigmatic herald.See it at Prime VideoThe MCU’s first Fantastic Four movie has grossed over $500 million at the global box office since it landed in theaters on July 25. While it trails behind other big 2025 releases like Superman and A Minecraft Movie, as Carlos Morales so aptly writes for IGN, “It’s fine if not every superhero movie makes a billion dollars.” Disney head Bob Iger has spoken about the studio’s massive output in the past decade, and pointed to a pivot toward “quality over quantity” starting with Thunderbolts earlier this year. In the same vein, Fantastic Four: First Steps stood out to me from the rest of the MCU releases, first for its '60s-inspired marketing, then for its earnesty. Clint Gage's review of the movie for IGN speaks highly of the new cast: “There’s a charisma to each of them individually and chemistry between them all,” going so far as to say they feel like a “proper family.”
Much of what resonated with this film is its portrayal of family, even for the cast themselves, as we spoke with star Vanessa Kirby earlier this year about her role as both a strong superhero and mother. For the timeline-sensitive, the movie kicks off Phase 6 of the MCU, and is certainly important viewing before next year’s Avengers: Doomsday. 4K Steelbook Listings Now Live, Releasing October 14Out October 14The Fantastic Four: First Steps - Amazon-Exclusive 4K Steelbook1$74.99 at AmazonOut October 14The Fantastic Four: First Steps Walmart-Exclusive Blu-ray0$29.96 at WalmartOut October 14The Fantastic Four: First Steps - 4K Steelbook Edition1$44.99 at AmazonOut October 14The Fantastic Four: First Steps - 4K Standard Edition0$49.99 at AmazonOut October 14The Fantastic Four: First Steps - Blu-ray Ediiton0$40.99 at AmazonA spread of physical editions also went up for preorder as the movie landed on digital. Every retailer, including Amazon and Walmart, seems to have their own exclusive version of the movie. Besides price, double check whether you’re getting the movie on Blu-ray or 4K and what bonus features are included (most importantly the deleted Mole Man scene). Otherwise, I’d just go with whatever steelbook cover you think would look best on your shelf. Disney+ Streaming Release Date Still TBA One thing we still don’t know is when Fantastic Four will land on Disney+. Recent MCU releases, like Captain America: Brave New World and Thunderbolts, landed on the service around two months after their initial release in theaters. Assuming a similar timeline, Fantastic Four: First Steps should arrive on Disney+ in September.
