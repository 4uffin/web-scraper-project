But, that's changed again recently, and I’ve appreciated that Konami is putting in the work to bring new players in (and lapsed players back like myself) to this most unique of card games. I've been loving my reentry into the TCG, with last year seeing the arrival of a Two-Player Starter Set and some 25th Anniversary reprints, alongside the Early Days Collection that offers a fantastic nostalgia hit for digital players. New this year is the 2025 Mega Pack Tin, and Konami kindly sent it over for me to take a look. So, let's discuss my impressions and then run through what the big chase cards are from this year's Mega-Pack, even if I had no luck in pulling them!2025 Mega Pack Tin
- $39.952025 Mega Pack Bundle
- $17.96The 2025 Mega-Pack Tin Is Great For CollectorsKicking off with the tin itself, it’s about the same size as the Legendary Collection and Two-Player Starter Set that we’ve seen in recent years.It’s worth stressing that there are three packs inside, so the tin is far from full, but the packs included are Mega-Packs. You can buy them with the tin, or in a Tuck Box instead.Yu-Gi-Oh! 2025 Mega Pack Bundle2$20.99 save 14%$17.96 at AmazonThese contain 1 Starlight Rare, 1 Prismatic Super Rare, 3 Ultra Rares and 8 Commons for building out your collection, so you’re getting 39 cards in total out of the full sets 450 cards.It’s a drop in the ocean when you look at it that way, but there are some great reprints on offer from across the game’s long history. Many of which you should be keeping an eye out for.I’ve always been impressed by Yu-Gi-Oh’s consistent art. Even common cards like Zoma the Earthbound look like a final boss from a video game. Still, as a big fan of dragons in any medium, my favorite has to be the hilariously-named Number 95: Galaxy-Eyes Dark Matter Dragon.Given there are cards that run the gamut from the classic Pot of Greed to Destiny Hero - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer, there’s a huge array of options you could find, whether you’re buying pack bundles or the tin.If you do get the tin, you’ll also find a trio of card dividers that call to mind classic playing cards with their two-sided designs. There’s one for Yugi, Kaiba, and Joey, with their respective monsters on the opposite side of the card, and the designs are inverted on the other side.It’s a nice touch, and while it’s a little redundant given how large the tin is considering the number of cards, it feels like a great way to organize your deck.The 10 Most In-Demand Cards From the 2025 Mega Pack SetI enjoyed my time opening the 2025 Mega Tin, and while I wasn't pulling anything super rare, I can still confidently say it's a fun way to dig for chase cards without breaking the bank. It would definitely make a good stocking filler going into the holiday period as well. That being said, what's actually popping off from the new set? For starters, S:P Little Knight is rearing its head… again. Turning games since its release, it’s the one of the most popular pick-ups 2025 tins right now (according to data from our friends at TCGPlayer), and well worth chasing... or even buying standalone if you so choose.

Alongside other trap cards Dominus Purge & Impulse, these are demanding medium to high price tags on resale right now, with market values shifting between $20-$34 at the time of publication. And then the Mulcharmys; Fuwalos already has eight rarities and can still be hard to find even on the secondary market, while Purulia keeps creeping up despite have five printings of its own. Both are in high demand, and both are worth keeping an eye out for when cracking packs.There's plenty more to consider in the top ten most popular cards from Yu-Gi-Oh's 2025 Mega Packs, so ensure you're also looking out for the likes of Primite Lordly Lode, The Black Goat Laughs, Lacrima the Crimson Tears, Fiendsmith's Tract, and more.Lloyd Coombes is an experienced freelancer in tech, gaming and fitness seen at Polygon, Eurogamer, Macworld, TechRadar and many more.
