Walmart currently has it at the lowest price I've seen all year, now just $429.99 after a $50 off instant discount. The AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D is considered to be the best gaming processor currently on the market and outperforms even pricier AMD and Intel CPUs.The Gamer's Choice: AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D CPU for $429.99AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D AM5 Desktop Processor16$479.00 save 10%$429.99 at WalmartAMD's X3D series processors are optimized for gaming. Thanks to AMD's 3D-V-Cache technology, they outperform pricier non-X3D counterparts. There are three models in the current generation lineup: the 9800X3D, 9900X3D, and 9950X3D.The 9800X3D boasts a max boost clock of 5.2GHz with 8 cores, 16 threads, and 104MB of L2-L3 cache. Despite being the least expensive processor in this stack, it performs nearly identically in games with the other two models. It has the fewest number of cores, so it isn't ideal from non-gamers who plan to use their rig for rendering, AI, or anything else that can benefit from as many cores as possible. This, however, keeps the cost down, and the 9800XD is an absolute monster of a processor at its price point and the obvious pick for most gamers. On Passmark, the 9800X3D has the second highest gaming score, trailing a mere 300 points behind the considerably pricier 9900X3D.AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D Review by Jacqueline Thomas"The AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D is extremely powerful in games, which makes it easier to recommend than other recent processors like the Intel Core Ultra 9 285K or Ryzen 9 9900X. Especially if you’re building a rig with a powerful graphics card, the 9800X3D is going to be the best way to get the most performance out of whichever GPU you pair it with."Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.
