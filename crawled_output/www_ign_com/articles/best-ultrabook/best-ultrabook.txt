The term "ultrabook" may have been born out of Intel's marketing team to describe high-end, premium laptops, but it is not limited to just Intel-powered ultrabooks anymore. At its core, an ultrabook should deliver outstanding productivity performance while also being slim, lightweight, and highly portable. It's a reliable laptop that won't weigh you down or force you to carry a charger everywhere you go. TL;DR – These Are the Best Ultrabooks:8Our Top PickAsus Zenbook S 166See it at Best BuySee it at AsusHP Pavilion Aero 130See it at HP8Razer Blade 14 (2025)0See it at RazerSee it at Amazon8Microsoft Surface Laptop 113See it at Amazon9Asus
Zenbook S 140See it at Best BuySee it at Asus8Apple MacBook Pro 16-inch (M3 Max)0See it at AmazonThe best ultrabooks available today can be downright suprising with just how capable they are given their size and weight. Our overall best pick right now, the Asus Zenbook S 16, competes with high-end desktops all while sipping the smallest amount of power and running exceptionally quietly. From budget-friendly offerings to powerful workhorses capable of editing 4K video and beyond, these are the best ultrabooks you can buy right now.Asus Zenbook S 16 – PhotosView 19 Images1. Asus Zenbook S 16Best Ultrabook in 20258Our Top PickAsus Zenbook S 166The Asus Zenbook S 16 is a great Windows alternative to the MacBook Pro. It’s effortless to carry and a joy to use.See it at Best BuySee it at AsusProduct SpecificationsDisplay16" (2880 x 1800)CPUAMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370GPUAMD Radeon 890MRAM32GB LPDDR5XStorage1TB PCIe SSDWeight3.31 poundsSize13.92" x 9.57" x 0.47" - 0.51"Battery lifeAround 15 hoursPROSExceptionally thin and lightOutstanding performance with an all-day batteryBeautiful 3K OLED touchscreen Impressive gaming performanceCONSSome keyboard flex I tested and reviewed the Asus Zenbook S 16, and it's the best overall ultrabook today. It’s ridiculously thin at only 13mm at its thickest part and is nearly as impressively lightweight at only 3.31lbs. It has fantastic battery life, a gorgeous OLED display, and the best gaming performance of any integrated GPU yet, topping portable gaming PCs like the Asus ROG Ally X and Ayaneo Kun. It’s the full package and then some.The Zenbook S 16 nails what it means to be an ultrabook. It’s light enough that you can almost forget you’re carrying it and thin enough that it easily slides into a crowded backpack or briefcase. When it’s time to get to work, it performs among the top ultrabooks available today, all while using less power and generating less noise thanks to its cutting edge AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 CPU. It even offers better connectivity than most ultrabooks with two USB Type-C ports, a full-size USB Type-A, an SD card reader, and an HDMI-out port to use with a great portable monitor. The display is excellent, featuring a crisp 2880x1880 resolution (halfway between 1440p and 4K) and stunning colors. Since it’s an OLED, you can count on rich, deep blacks, and its 500-nit screen is bright enough to use, and look good, in any environment. Topping this all out is 15 hours of battery life. The Asus Zenbook S 16 is the cutting-edge definition of what an ultrabook is meant to be and more.2. HP Pavilion Aero 13Best Budget UltrabookHP Pavilion Aero 130At less than $800, this laptop is a killer value. See it at HPProduct SpecificationsDisplay13.3” 2K (1,920 x 1,200) IPS CPUAMD Ryzen 5 8840URAM16GB DDR5 6,400MHzStorage512MB NVMe SSDWeight2.2 poundsSize 11.7" x 8.31" x 0.69"Battery lifeAround 12 hoursPROSGreat balance of price to performanceFast processor and ample memoryUltraportable designAll-day battery lifeCONSLimited storageIf you're looking for a more affordable ultrabook, look no further than the HP Pavilion Aero 13. Coming in at less than $800, this notebook offers a fast Ryzen 7 processor and 16GB of DDR5 memory to make sure that all of your productivity applications run smoothly, even when you need to multitask. It's incredibly thin and light so you can carry it throughout the day without feeling encumbered.When you look at all that it has to offer, the price is incredibly reasonable – surprising, even. Between its processor and memory, it can be a reliable companion for almost anything but gaming (and even then, its integrated graphics are no slouch if you're content to turn down some settings). Its biggest drawback is that it only has 512GB of storage and less that's free to save files on (Windows takes up a portion of that storage before you add anything of your own). You'll want to invest in a
good external hard drive if you want to save work locally. But given that this laptop is only about 13 inches and is exceptionally thin and light, that shouldn't be the deciding factor. Razer Blade 14 (2025) – PhotosView 10 Images
3. Razer Blade 14 (2025)Best Ultrabook for Gaming8Razer Blade 14 (2025)0With a stunning and fast QHD+ display and powerful internals housed in a sleek chassis, this 14-inch luxury laptop is ready for any game.See it at RazerSee it at AmazonProduct SpecificationsDisplay14” (2880x1800) OLED, 120HzCPUAMD Ryzen AI 9 365GPUUp to Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070RAMUp to 64GBStorageUp to 2TBWeight3.59 poundsDimensions12.23” x 8.83” x 0.62” - 0.64"PROSGreat gaming performancePremium look and feelExcellent screen Very good port selection CONSScreen is not touch enabledHigh costWhen it comes to ultrabooks designed for gaming, it doesn't get much better than the Razer Blade 14. When I reviewed this laptop, I was impressed by its port selection, portability, and excellent performance. It doesn't come cheap, but it's well worth considering if you like an ultrabook design but still want great gaming performance.The Blade 14 reminds me of the MacBook Air, especially in its Mercury colorway. At only 3.6lbs and 16mm thick, it's exceptionally portable and can easily disappear into a bag. While it doesn't have the uniform vent-free design of the MacBook Air, it does have an all-aluminum unibody construction that gives it a premium look and feel.This portable powerhouse comes equipped with either an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 or RTX 5070 and an AMD Ryzen AI 9-365 CPU. It's a potent combination that's more than capable of delivering for everything from content creation to high-performance gaming. And since it utilizes Nvidia's latest graphics technologies, you'll be able to take full advantage of cutting-edge features like DLSS 4.0 and multi-frame generation.Its vibrant OLED screen is another high point and comes with a 2880x1800 (3K) resolution across 14 inches. That's incredibly crisp with a pixel density of 243 pixels per inch. It's also able to run at up to 120Hz with support for G-Sync for smooth, tear-free gameplay.For productivity, it comes with an all-day battery that's able to last 10-11 hours of regular use. If you're gaming, you'll still need to bring the included charger for the best performance and anything more than an hour or two of uptime. That's the case with every gaming laptop, though, so it's hard to hold that against it. A high-performance yet highly compact gaming PC like this doesn't come cheap. Prices start at $2,000 and extend to right around $2,600 for its highest configuration of an RTX 5070, 64GB of RAM, and 2TB of storage. You'll be hard-pressed to find such high levels of performance anywhere else, however, so this is well worth considering, both for the sum of its parts and in raw gaming prowess.

Microsoft Surface Laptop 11Best for Students8Microsoft Surface Laptop 113Colorful laptop offering a Snapdragon processor, plenty of memory and storage, and a solid battery lifeSee it at AmazonProduct SpecificationsDisplay13.8" (2304 x 1536)CPUSnapdragon X Plus to Snapdragon X EliteGPUQualcomm AdrenoRAM16GB - 32GB LPDDR5XStorage256GB - 1TB PCIe SSDWeight2.96 poundsSize11.85" x 8.67" x 0.69"Battery lifeUp to 20 hoursPROSGreat performanceLots of fun color optionsLong battery life CONSSome apps aren't compatibleLooking for a reliable laptop to take to and from classes without destroying your back? The latest generation Surface Laptop and Surface Pro 2-in-1 is it, coming fully equipped with powerful Snapdragon Plus and Snapdragon Elite processors, plenty of memory and storage, and battery life that can last multiple work days depending on how they’re used. For the purposes of this list, our technical recommendation is the Surface Laptop, but just know that we give a big thumbs up to the Surface Pro for those of you who prefer their ultrabooks to be a little more convertible (and don’t mind buying a keyboard case, too).Compared to the last generation, Microsoft has made some major upgrades. These new Surfaces have more memory and storage options, but even the base model, which has 16GB or RAM and 256GB of storage, is enough for solid system performance. The Snapdragon Plus and Elite, which adds two more cores, are incredibly power efficient. Microsoft rates this laptop as offering up to 20 hours of battery life when watching video and up to 13 hours of web browsing and productivity, and it supports fast charging and can power up from zero to 80% in one hour.
The downside is that not all apps work with the Snapdragon processors. There is built-in emulation to help compensate for this and it works for many apps, but not all. Now that Qualcomm is in the processor business in earnest, we expect the list of compatible apps to continue growing over time. Until then, here's an ever-expanding list of compatible apps. Chances are, the apps you need for school are already on there.
5. Asus Zenbook S 14Best for BusinessAsus Zenbook S 140This ultra portable laptop packs incredible battery life, snappy performance, and a beautiful OLED touchscreen display.See it at AsusSee it at Best Buy Product SpecificationsDisplay14" (2880 x 1800)CPUIntel Core Ultra 7 258VGPUIntel ArcRAM32GB LPDDR5XStorage1TB PCIe SSDWeight2.65 poundsSize12.22" x 8.45" x 0.51"Battery life15+ hoursPROSThinner, lighter, and more powerfulGreat battery lifeImproved gaming performanceGorgeous OLED touchscreenCONSNo microSD card readerThe Asus Zenbook S 14 is the smaller sibling to the No. 1 pick on this list, but it earns a place here due to its excellent balance of processing power and battery life. In my testing using Procyon's battery test (which simulates mixed productivity use), this laptop ran for over 16 hours, so you can count on two or more work days between recharges. Throughout all of this time, I found that it ran very smooth, even when working in creative apps like Adobe Photoshop. In the Microsoft Office suite or any of the Google Drive applications, you could easily be fooled into thinking that you are using a laptop that costs twice as much.Since its release, even though the larger screen of the Zenbook S 16 has its own appeal, the ultra-portability of the S 14 makes it a more compelling choice for carrying through the day. It's incredibly thin, at less than a half inch at its thickest point, and weighs just over 2.5lbs. Carrying it through the day was almost effortless, and I never had any trouble sliding it into a packed bag.It's even a compelling choice for light gaming between meetings. It uses the latest generation Intel Core Ultra 7 processor and utilizes Intel Arc graphics – the company's best integrated graphics yet. While it won't compete with a gaming laptop using a dedicated graphics card, you might be surprised at just how capable it is. If you're willing to dial back the resolution to 1200p, you can easily get games like Cyberpunk 2077 running between 30 and 60fps. And on its OLED screen, you can count on a real visual treat.6. Apple MacBook Pro 16-inch (M3 Max)Best Ultrabook for Creatives8Apple MacBook Pro 16-inch (M3 Max)0The 16-inch MacBook Pro with the M3 Max chip is the most powerful Mac ever.See it at AmazonProduct SpecificationsDisplay16.2" (3456 x 2234)CPUM3 MaxGPUIntegrated (40-core)RAM48GB - 128GBStorage1TB - 8TB SSDWeight4.8 poundsSize14.01" x 9.77" x 0.66"Battery lifeUp to 22 hoursPROSIncredibly powerful for a laptopHighly configurableVery good battery life Thin and comparatively lightCONSCan easily get very expensiveFor creative professionals, the best choice is still the Apple MacBook Pro based on the testing in our review of the M2 Pro. Apple offers a number of different configurations but for the best performance when editing videos, rendering art assets, and other heavy duty tasks, it doesn’t get better than the top of the line M3 Max version. It’s more powerful than a laptop has any right to be, which is exactly why so many professional creators use it.The MacBook Pro 16 is a great pick no matter which version you choose, but one of its assets is how configurable it is. It’s available with two different tiers of the M3 Max processor (16-core or 18-core), up to 128GB of memory, and a whopping 8TB of storage. If you want a MacBook Pro 16 but aren’t interested in putting the pedal all the way to the floor, the standard M3 Pro version starts a whopping $1,500 cheaper and is more than enough for most creators. The biggest drawback is the default SSD, which is only 512GB instead of a full terabyte like the M3 Max versions, so you may need to look into external storage. Every version comes with the same beautiful liquid retina screen, which is widely regarded as one of the best displays on any laptop available today. It’s not all about power: The available software and creative tools are the other half of what makes this such a good choice. Apple has been a go-to choice for creative applications for many years, so there’s a deep ecosystem of apps no matter what your creative bent is. You can even add licenses for Logic and Final Cut Pro when you checkout through Apple. Just saying: Windows machines can still be great for creative work, and choosing a Windows machine also circumvents the MacBook Pro’s walled garden approach to software and hardware. It’s the MacBook’s biggest hurdle – you’re buying into the Apple ecosystem, which means often having limited choices for supporting peripherals. Still, it’s a sacrifice many creative professionals find worthwhile for its powerful tools.
How We Chose the Best UltrabooksTo find the best ultrabooks, we first define what qualities an ultrabook needs to have to, a) be an ultrabook instead of a normal, if lightweight, laptop; and, b) be one of the best choices you can buy today. Any ultrabook needs to be thin, light, and have extended battery life. It needs to be dedicated to high-performance productivity, and if it can play games, that’s icing on the cake. To form our list, we first evalutate the ultrabooks that we’ve reviewed and spent time with. With those early contenders written down, we consult other expert sources from across the web and look into major offerings from noteworthy brands (an ever-growing list). Critical impressions from industry experts are important, especially as they relate to our first criteria, and benchmark scores and real world impressions are all considered. We then turn to the community, poring over user reviews, Reddit recommendations, and cautionary tales to find the ultrabooks that are enhancing the lives of real users on a daily basis.After compiling a list of the best choices, we break that down into key categories to help recommend the best ultrabook to you, no matter what kind of user you are. Whether you’re a work by day, game by night kind of user, a student, or a business professional that needs a dependable notebook to carry them through the day without weighing them down, we have the best picks, right here on this list. Things to Consider When Shopping for an UltrabookBuying an ultrabook is not a minor investment, so you shouldn’t rush when making your decision. Before looking at ultrabooks, you’ll want to set your maximum budget – this means you won’t exceed what you can afford, allowing you to configure the right ultrabook to suit your needs. If you’re on a lower budget, you may need to sacrifice more powerful specs. Rather than looking at ultrabooks with 16GB of DDR5 RAM, for example, you could drop down to 8GB of DDR5 or even DDR4 RAM to save a bit of money.Similarly, if you’re not fussed about using your ultrabook to play AAA games, integrated graphics like Intel Iris XE Graphics or Intel Arc Graphics will be plenty suitable. Rather than splashing out on an Nvidia RTX GPU, you can spend your money elsewhere on other components and features.However, if you do have the budget to go big, then you’ll want to choose an ultrabook that’s more futureproof. With the latest generation of hardware, your ultrabook will last longer and won’t have to be upgraded as often. A 14th Gen i5 or i7 CPU or an AMD Ryzen 7000 or 9000 series processor with RTX 4000-series or AMD Radeon 7000-series GPU is a great place to start.FAQsWhat is an ultrabook laptop?Intel coined the term “ultrabook” back in 2011 to describe laptops that are exceptionally thin, light, and use powerful hardware. These days, the term gets thrown around a bit more broadly to encompass laptops that aren’t necessarily the most powerful, but are exceptionally portable and are powerful enough to easily accomplish day-to-day productivity tasks with ease. Most ultrabooks also offer extended battery life so they can reliably get through a full eight-hour work day without dying on you.Is a MacBook considered an ultrabook?While a MacBook isn’t technically an ultrabook because it’s made by Apple, it could be considered a type of ultrabook. MacBooks are powerful yet lightweight laptops running on Apple’s macOS. Are ultrabooks good for gaming?Ultrabooks are not gaming laptops, so if fragging enemies or gaining levels is your bread and butter, you would be better suited with one of the best gaming laptops. With that in mind, if you’re willing to play at lower graphics settings or resolutions, it’s certainly possible to play games on many newer ultrabooks. Intel and AMD have made strides with the built-in gaming capabilities of its processors. Cloud gaming is another viable option that tends to work very well on ultrabooks, but requires a subscription to Xbox Game Pass, Nvidia GeForce Now, or other related game-hosting services.
