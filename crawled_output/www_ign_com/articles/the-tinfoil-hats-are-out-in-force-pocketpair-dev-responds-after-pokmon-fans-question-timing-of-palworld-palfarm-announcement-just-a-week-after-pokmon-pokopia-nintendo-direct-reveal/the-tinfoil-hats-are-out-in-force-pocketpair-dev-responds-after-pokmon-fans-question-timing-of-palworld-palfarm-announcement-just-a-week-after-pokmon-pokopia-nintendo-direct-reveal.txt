Beware, the coziness can turn chaotic ‚Äî watch out for wild Pals that pilfer fresh produce.‚ÄùPok√©mon Pokopia, meanwhile, due out on Nintendo Switch 2 in 2026, is described as a life simulation game ‚Äúwhere players can create their own Pok√©mon paradise.‚Äù The game features Ditto as its protagonist, who has transformed to look like a human. ‚ÄúAs Ditto, players can explore and learn moves from the Pok√©mon they befriend ‚Äî such as Bulbasaur‚Äôs Leafage to grow greenery, or Squirtle‚Äôs Water Gun to revive dried-up plants ‚Äî expanding their capabilities and helping them create an inviting environment to attract a variety of Pok√©mon,‚Äù Nintendo explained.‚ÄúPlayers can collect materials, build furniture, grow vegetables, and create homes for Pok√©mon, allowing them to experience a cozy, slow life with Pok√©mon ‚Äî one that they build themselves from the ground up. Over time, players can develop a town of their own and invite other players or Pok√©mon to visit. Pok√©mon Pokopia also features a day-night cycle linked to real-world time, changing weather, and in-game locations with their own unique characteristics.‚ÄùSome were quick to question the timing of Palworld: Palfarm's announcement, despite the fact games take years to make and reveals are planned long in advance. "The timing of this just after the Pok√©mon Pokopia announcement. They got balls, I respect that," said redditor Sweaty_Molasses_3899. "They probably felt they needed to announce this earlier than they might have wanted simply to get ahead of accusations of 'copying' their idea for a farm-sim game after Pokopia got announced," suggested KJShen. "I feel like this announcement is to spite Nintendo for their recent bs," added Brohtworst. "Can't be a coincidence they'd develop something so similar to Pokopia." "It's so uninspired to make a game that's more about one upping a company than actually making something good," declared stcrIight.Now, Pocketpair communications director and publishing manager John ‚ÄúBucky‚Äù Buckley, who has become the face of the company for western fans, has issued a response on social media, saying ‚Äúthe tinfoil hats are out in force.‚Äù‚ÄúA certain % of silliness and grumpy people were expected when announcing Palfarm, and a smaller % of "REEEE POCKETPAIR" was expected too‚Ä¶‚Äù Bucky said.‚ÄúBut I'm surprised how many people think we're wizard-level developers able to make a game in one week. ‚ÄúThe tinfoil hats are out in forceüòá‚ÄùThen: ‚ÄúThere is a certain level of poetic irony‚Ä¶ the same people who "REEE POCKETPAIR" are the same people thinking we made an entire game in one week. ‚ÄúSchr√∂dinger's Pocketpair I guess. We are both a ‚Äòslop company‚Äô and capable of making entire games in one week it seemsü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚ÄùThis is of course a reference to the copying accusations Palworld itself suffered following its explosive launch early in 2024. Fans dubbed the game ‚ÄòPok√©mon with guns‚Äô due to similarities between some of the mechanics. Nintendo and The Pok√©mon Company eventually sued Pocketpair in a patent case that is still ongoing.Last week, Pocketpair said it was heads down getting Palworld ready to leave early access and officially release its 1.0 update at some point in 2026. Palworld will launch proper next year alongside what sounds like a huge update, which Pocketpair is now focusing on.All the while, Nintendo has been busy obtaining patents ‚Äî some of which IP lawyers said should never have been granted ‚Äî as it develops its case against Pocketpair, which has vowed to defend itself in court.The case involves three patents granted by the Japan Patent Office: two related to monster capture and release, and one related to riding characters. All three patents were filed in 2024, after Palworld came out. However, they are actually derived from earlier Nintendo patents dating from 2021. In other words, it seems that once Palworld came on the scene, Nintendo filed divisional patents that were geared to fight specifically against Palworld‚Äôs alleged infringement of the original patents.Nintendo's lawyers trying to figure out if this breaches a future patent they're working on pic.twitter.com/gRHF6UZj9x‚Äî Adam Vjestica (@ItsMrProducts) September 23, 2025 Since then, Pocketpair has made changes to Palworld‚Äôs disputed mechanics. The November 2024 patch removed the ability to summon Pals by throwing Pok√©ball-like Pal Spheres (now Pals just materialize next to you when summoned). In May this year, another Palworld update changed how you can glide in the game ‚Äî instead of directly grabbing onto Glider Pals, now you just simply use Pal-buffed Glider equipment. Then, in July, Nintendo and The Pok√©mon Company reworded one of the patents in the case.At GDC in March, IGN sat down for an extended conversation with Bucky following his talk at the conference, 'Community Management Summit: A Palworld Roller Coaster: Surviving the Drop.' During that talk, Buckley went into candid detail about a number of Palworld‚Äôs struggles, especially the accusations of it using generative AI (which Pocketpair has since debunked pretty soundly) and stealing Pokemon‚Äôs models for its own Pals. He even commented on Nintendo‚Äôs patent infringement lawsuit against the studio, saying it ‚Äúcame as a shock‚Äù and was ‚Äúsomething that no one even considered.‚ÄùWesley is Director, News at IGN.
