I’ve had a blast in battles and boss fights, but too often in between them I had to slog through a repetitive story plagued with unmemorable characters, levels peppered with awkward platforming, and puzzles that would make the shape-matching challenges you’d give to a toddler look like rocket science, all disguised in a deceptively flashy package. Originality is fleeting in games, a medium where ideas and innovations blur the line between craft, technology, business, and art. That’s especially true in the ever-wider tent of high-budget fantasy action games with flashy combos and light RPG elements. And normally, that’s not an issue; even a competent take on a character action game inspired by the likes of Bayonetta or Devil May Cry is probably going to provide some fluffy, inoffensive fun – and to its credit, Lost Soul Aside is more than competent as an action game. But in clearly borrowing and worsening ideas from multiple recent Final Fantasy games in particular, it’s not attempting an idea of its own that didn’t work out; it’s doing something badly that begs comparison to games that got the same ideas right, some of them nearly a decade ago.What style do you prefer in action games?Fast Hack-n-Slash character action like DMC or BayonettaWeighty, cinematic blows like God of WarPunishing, lock-n-dodge combat like in FromSoft’s gamesHand-to-hand combat like Arkham Asylum or SifuOther - tell us in the commentsAnswerSee ResultsThat’s what drove me up the wall during my playthrough. I feel like I’ve been playing the product of boardroom meetings held a week after Final Fantasy XV or VII Remake came out where the discussion was on how to capitalize on their success, rather than a passion project made by a team paying homage to those games. From a we-have-Noctis-at-home main character (named Kaser), to the story’s setup feeling awfully familiar, to the structure and scale of each level resembling a pared-down Final Fantasy VII Remake, with all of it peppered with uninteresting extra puzzles and platforming challenges, I found something new to sigh at around every corner – and trust me, that’s not because I was swooning over the bad-boy protagonist.Sound familiar? If it doesn’t you should play Final Fantasy 7 instead.“Set in a sci-fi/fantasy world where a mysterious alien energy has been harnessed to fuel an all-powerful empire, Lost Soul Aside opens with a premonition that humanity is soon to face its darkest days and that a savior will rise to the occasion. Then, you’re thrust into an opening segment where you’re introduced to an underground resistance organization run from a poor neighborhood in the capital city as they carry out an open act of defiance against the empire – sound familiar? If it doesn’t you should play Final Fantasy 7 instead, because it’s done better there and this retelling doesn’t do anything interesting or original with it.Doled out through occasionally dazzling, action-packed cutscenes but mostly in significantly less impressive, awkward dialogue sequences, the story is highly repetitive. Every opportunity for a twist or tonal shift is squandered in favor of a straightforward, black-and-white tale that doesn’t feel like it’s about anything other than wanting to be like other RPGs. Lost Soul Aside doesn’t use its roughly 16-hour runtime efficiently enough for any characters to grow. Instead, it flings proper noun after proper noun at you, hoping that one of its many side characters will make an impression. But this story’s rhythm moves too quickly for anybody to exist beyond cartoonish caricature at best. Being generous, maybe their memorable characteristics were lost in the English translation, but maybe they were never there to begin with. Its individual story moments come in a similarly offbeat meter, with awkward animations and mostly flat voice acting filling in its hours’ worth of basic, over-the-shoulder dialogue segments. All of it is delivered by characters who often fall into unflattering RPG cliches (like a scantily clad woman who looks and acts like a teenager but is actually hundreds of years old or a gruff, emo protagonist who’d fit in with a boyband and has a mysterious backstory and a penchant for kicking ass) without playing with or evolving these ideas in any discernible way.With a better localization, more lively voice direction, or a stronger commitment to the bit, Lost Soul Aside could perhaps have nailed the same B-movie-like campy charm worn so well by the action games that so clearly inspired its better parts. Instead, it’s somehow both half-hearted and overserious. Kaser and his dragon-like sidekick Lord Arena eventually share a few moments that bent the edges of my lips into a smirk, but it takes so long for the pair to hit their stride that I was mostly checked out from the story and there only for the action by the time their dynamic clicked.Lost Soul Aside’s combat system is the star of the show.“Combat in Lost Soul Aside acts as a palette cleanser for the uninteresting story. Kaser hacks and slashes through enemies with stylish flair, using the genre-standard light and heavy attack buttons. Mixing the two together with different timing and order will open up new combos, and you can unlock even more using skill points to fill out branches on a skill tree. With a choice between four different weapons – sword, greatsword, poleblade, and scythe – each has its own skill path and playstyle. And switching them on the fly mid-combo opens up an expressive, varied tree of attacks catered to a range of playstyles. The polearm, for example, works well at long range, where the greatsword is best for dealing satisfying, heavy blows. My favorite was the standard sword, though; an all-around, quick, agile weapon with solid ranged and melee attacks, it’s remained my go-to for cutting up legions of invading Voidrax beings during the duration of my playthrough.Supplemented by additional mechanics like the combo-extending Burst Pursuit that allows you to throw out big finishers after a combo or the Witch Time-like perfect dodge that nets you a different, powerful attack for each weapon, requisite – though cleverly restrained – parry, and the Arena powers that let you throw out big, area-of-effect attacks that work well for resetting the battlefield, Lost Soul Aside’s combat system is the star of the show. Even against largely unmemorable enemies, I’m really enjoying experimenting with new combinations and powers as Kaser and Arena’s flashy animations dazzled during longer sequences.The boss fights that cap off parts of each level make for even more stylish encounters. While bigger opponents play with scale, throwing out massive, arena-sweeping attacks, others are more nimble duels to the finish against human-sized opponents. Nearly every fight culminates in an exciting finale. Dosed with just the right amount of toothy challenge, each battle provided the right kind of brain-tickling, thrilling showdown as I dodged and weaved between attacks before wailing on their stagger meter to deal a special Sync Finisher on my dazed opponent.I did find an odd pain point in some of these fights, though: There’s not enough feedback when Kaser takes damage from some smaller swings. So as I’m wailing away at a bad guy seemingly doing well, I’ll glance down at my health bar and it’s significantly lower than I thought it would be because I didn’t know that I’d taken any damage in the first place. Thankfully, Kaser and Arena are talky enough that you'll hear about it once your health is really low, and those barks stand out against the otherwise-repetitive battle chatter.Unfortunately, Lost Soul Aside isn’t a pure boss-rush combat gauntlet, and the rest of the gameplay between each fight isn’t nearly as compelling. Most of the levels are made up of a linear, boring series of corridors with occasional “open” areas that add an extra platforming “challenge” or two to the mix. Sure, there might be a basic puzzle or treasure chest around a corner (though I used almost none of the crafting materials accumulated during my playthrough because the rewards didn’t improve my stats enough to bother with), but nothing I’ve seen so far has really come close to justifying its existence beyond drab padding between battles. Its high-fidelity, visually detailed spaces mask simple, homogenous non-combat challenges and empty chambers that toss a few unrewarding pickups your way, seemingly just to break things up.That makes sense, considering most of the level progression and exploration is marked by boring and simple paths where you mostly just walk forward until the next fight, broken up with a simple puzzle here or there. It was nothing offensive.... until the platforming reared its ugly head. At multiple points during Lost Soul Aside I found myself jumping through platforming segments that could make even the Plinko and Chuckster levels that make up the dregs of Super Mario Sunshine look like a blast. Plagued with imprecise running and walking, floaty jumps with laggy-feeling animations, poor feedback, a claustrophobic field of view, and a barely visible shadow, I am truly shocked at the low-quality platforming I endured to get from fight to fight. Some of it was optional, but I still had to do a lot to complete any given level. Thankfully, I could find ways to cheese certain annoying segments, but don’t expect to see anyone at GDQ showing off Lost Soul Aside speedrunning techniques; these are tourniquets used to slow fatal bleeding, not expressive tools indicative of a mechanically deep platformer.VerdictLost Soul Aside would’ve been a great character action game if it hadn’t gone out of its way to do anything outside of that. Cosplaying as a Final Fantasy game, its wheel-spinning story doesn’t go anywhere and an unmemorable cast of (often derivative) characters are played by actors who aren’t given much to work with. Boring level design is going through the motions at best and annoyingly unskippable at worst, and it’s loaded with painfully poor 3D platforming sequences and extremely basic puzzles. Next time it should really just stick to combat.In This ArticleLost Soul AsideUltiZero GamesAug 29, 2025Rate this gameRelated GuidesOverviewCrafting RecipesDocumentsTrinkets5Review scoringmediocreLost Soul Aside’s repetitive story, derivative characters, and bland level design take turns setting up rakes for its excellent combat to step on.
