On an island in a long-lost sea, a forgotten lighthouse stands dormant in the shadow of a distant mountain peak. As withering tendrils spread and coalesce, it awakens. Taken with a mysterious sense of purpose and joined by a spirited seabird, it embarks upon a heartening tale of unlikely companionship, an odyssey of mystifying metamorphosis, and an unexpected journey towards the center of the island, into realms beyond understanding.DevelopersDouble Fine ProductionsPublishersXbox Game StudiosInitial ReleaseOct 17, 2025PlatformsGenresPlatformerHowLongToBeat--Main Story--Story + Sides--Everything--All StylesKeeper NewsLatestVideosArticlesGameplayTrailers3:062d ago2d agoKeeper301:16:209d ago9d agoBorderlands 4Michael Higham + 1 moreAug 22, 2025Aug 22, 2025 - Light at the end of the tunnel.Brutal LegendWesley Yin-Poole1211:08Aug 21, 2025Aug 21, 2025KeeperMax Scoville113:28Aug 20, 2025Aug 20, 2025KeeperJul 24, 2025Jul 24, 2025 - Every game currently in development at an Xbox game studio.BladeMatt Kim208Jun 18, 2025Jun 18, 2025 - What was S-tier?007 First LightIGN Staff111:39Jun 8, 2025Jun 8, 2025Keeper3Jun 8, 2025Jun 8, 2025 - Sure, why not.KeeperRebekah Valentine40Jun 8, 2025Jun 8, 2025 - Microsoft's big summer showcase featured Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, Invincible, and MoreCall of Duty: Black Ops 7Michael Cripe699Reviews•Editor Columns•News•Guides•Upcoming Sales Events•How to Watch Guides•Board Game Reviews•GTA 5 Cheats•Best Streaming Bundles•IGN Store•Top Deals•Contact Us•IGN YouTube•HowLongToBeat•IGN TikTok•IGN Twitter•Map Genie•Eurogamer•Rock Paper Shotgun•VG247•Maxroll•Privacy Policy•Terms of Use
