The year is 2052. Societies are teetering on collapse, plagues spread unchecked, and shadow governments shape the future. You are JC Denton—a nano-augmented UNATCO operative tasked with protecting order. But the deeper you dig, the more lies you uncover. What begins as a mission becomes a fracture point in human history.DevelopersAspyr, Eidos MontrealPublishersAspyrFranchisesDeus ExInitial ReleaseFeb 5, 2026PlatformsGenresRPG, Shooter, RemasterHowLongToBeat--Main Story--Story + Sides--Everything--All StylesDeus Ex Remastered NewsLatestVideosArticlesTrailers8:101d ago1d ago - Saros, Wolverine, Crimson Desert and much more!Battlefield 6245:221d ago1d agoDeus Ex RemasteredBrian Altano + 4 more1d ago1d ago - Coming to PC and consoles from Aspyr Media.Deus Ex RemasteredMichael Cripe100:301d ago1d agoDeus Ex Remastered7Reviews•Editor Columns•News•Guides•Upcoming Sales Events•How to Watch Guides•Board Game Reviews•GTA 5 Cheats•Best Streaming Bundles•IGN Store•Top Deals•Contact Us•IGN YouTube•HowLongToBeat•IGN TikTok•IGN Twitter•Map Genie•Eurogamer•Rock Paper Shotgun•VG247•Maxroll•Privacy Policy•Terms of Use
