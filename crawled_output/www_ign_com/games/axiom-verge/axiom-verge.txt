A Tool-assisted speedrun is exactly how it sounds. Instead of a human player speedrunning through a game, it's instead a program that's had exact frame-perfect moves inputted into it to give a theoretical perfect speedrun. Most strategies used in a TAS speedrun are not humanly possible as they require insane precision and even rapid-fire button presses that no human could replicate. But while a TAS speedrun isn't humanly possible, the program's author is still required to have deep knowledge of the game's mechanics
to program the script in a way to pull off the insane speedrun.
