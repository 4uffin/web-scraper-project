Compared to Lumiose City as it appeared in the Pokémon X and Pokémon Y games, released in 2013, more greenery now adorns the city, alongside facilities with a cutting-edge feel.
In Lumiose City, spaces frequented by people—such as shopping arcades, cafés, and restaurants—coexist with more natural areas, such as waterfronts and verdant parks. At the center of Lumiose stands Prism Tower, the very symbol of the city.Content RatingFantasy ViolenceDevelopersGame FreakPublishersNintendo, The Pokemon CompanyFranchisesPokemonInitial ReleaseOct 16, 2025PlatformsGenresAction, RPGHowLongToBeat--Main Story--Story + Sides--Everything--All StylesGame HelpPokemon Legends: Z-A GuideOpen GuideTop Guide SectionsCharactersStarter PokemonMega Dimension DLCNew Mega Pokemon in Legends Z-APokedex (List of Pokemon)Pokemon Legends: Z-A NewsLatestVideosArticlesTrailers3:0913h ago13h ago - Get a glimpse at Mega Evolutions of Chesnaught, Delphox, and Greninja.Pokemon Legends: Z-A51d ago1d ago - An exciting change that could lead to drastically different team crafting.
