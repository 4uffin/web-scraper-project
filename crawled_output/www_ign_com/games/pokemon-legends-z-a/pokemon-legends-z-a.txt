Compared to Lumiose City as it appeared in the Pokémon X and Pokémon Y games, released in 2013, more greenery now adorns the city, alongside facilities with a cutting-edge feel.
In Lumiose City, spaces frequented by people—such as shopping arcades, cafés, and restaurants—coexist with more natural areas, such as waterfronts and verdant parks. At the center of Lumiose stands Prism Tower, the very symbol of the city.Content RatingFantasy ViolenceDevelopersGame FreakPublishersNintendo, The Pokemon CompanyFranchisesPokemonInitial ReleaseOct 16, 2025PlatformsGenresAction, RPGHowLongToBeat--Main Story--Story + Sides--Everything--All StylesGame HelpPokemon Legends: Z-A GuideOpen GuideTop Guide SectionsCharactersStarter PokemonMega Dimension DLCNew Mega Pokemon in Legends Z-APokedex (List of Pokemon)Pokemon Legends: Z-A NewsLatestVideosArticlesTrailers3d ago3d ago - Ditto.PalworldTom Phillips654d ago4d ago - Plus some handy advice on how to save up $187.49 when buying.Nintendo Switch 2Robert Anderson27d ago7d ago - Closing out the original Switch era.Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals TimeBlythe Dujardin1967d ago7d ago - Including new amiiboKirby Air RidersChristian Wait27d ago7d ago - Payday.Pokemon Legends: Z-ATom Phillips7320:409d ago9d agoAlien: Rogue Incursiontayo_oyekan + 3 more8:3410d ago10d agoDonkey Kong Bananza110d ago10d ago - Shock.Pokemon Legends: Z-ATom Phillips110:4310d ago10d agoPokemon Legends: Z-A - Mega Dimension21:2910d ago10d agoPokemon Legends: Z-A1Load MoreReviews•Editor Columns•News•Guides•Upcoming Sales Events•How to Watch Guides•Board Game Reviews•GTA 5 Cheats•Best Streaming Bundles•IGN Store•Top Deals•Contact Us•IGN YouTube•HowLongToBeat•IGN TikTok•IGN Twitter•Map Genie•Eurogamer•Rock Paper Shotgun•VG247•Maxroll•Privacy Policy•Terms of Use
