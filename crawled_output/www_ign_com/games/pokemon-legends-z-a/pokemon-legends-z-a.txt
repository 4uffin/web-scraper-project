Compared to Lumiose City as it appeared in the Pokémon X and Pokémon Y games, released in 2013, more greenery now adorns the city, alongside facilities with a cutting-edge feel.
In Lumiose City, spaces frequented by people—such as shopping arcades, cafés, and restaurants—coexist with more natural areas, such as waterfronts and verdant parks. At the center of Lumiose stands Prism Tower, the very symbol of the city.Content RatingFantasy ViolenceDevelopersGame FreakPublishersNintendo, The Pokemon CompanyFranchisesPokemonInitial ReleaseOct 16, 2025PlatformsGenresAction, RPGHowLongToBeat--Main Story--Story + Sides--Everything--All StylesGame HelpPokemon Legends: Z-A GuideOpen GuideTop Guide SectionsMega Dimension DLCNew Mega Pokemon in Legends Z-APokedex (List of Pokemon)Pokemon Legends: Z-A NewsLatestVideosArticlesTrailers4h ago4h ago - Payday.Pokemon Legends: Z-ATom Phillips2920:402d ago2d agoAlien: Rogue Incursiontayo_oyekan + 3 more8:342d ago2d agoDonkey Kong Bananza13d ago3d ago - Shock.Pokemon Legends: Z-ATom Phillips110:433d ago3d agoPokemon Legends: Z-A - Mega Dimension21:293d ago3d agoPokemon Legends: Z-A15:243d ago3d ago - IP lawyers and experts are concerned.BioShockDaemon Hatfield54d ago4d ago - "Outrageous stuff."PalworldVikki Blake + 1 more605:324d ago4d agoDice ThroneSeth G.
