Otherwise, Bananza’s DLC is an enjoyable but inessential expansion to DK and Pauline’s grand adventure.Logan PlantReviewed on Nintendo Switch 2Read ReviewSummarySightsee across this modern take on Donkey Kong’s home, packed with nostalgic views like DK’s Treehouse, Gangplank Galleon, and other iconic locations in the DLC that’s included in this bundle. Take in-game photos with familiar friends Diddy Kong, Dixie Kong, Cranky Kong, Rambi, and Squawks, and decorate DK Island with DLC-exclusive character statues that you can obtain with Banandium Chips. You might even find some hidden bonus stages among the mine cart tracks and jungle ruins!Content RatingDevelopersNintendo EAD Tokyo Software Development DepartmentPublishersNintendoFranchisesDonkey KongInitial ReleaseSep 12, 2025PlatformsGenresAction, Adventure, Platformer, DLC / ExpansionDonkey Kong Bananza: DK Island & Emerald Rush NewsLatestVideosArticlesGameplayTrailersReviews1d ago1d ago - This roguelite remix is an enjoyable but inessential expansion to DK and Pauline’s grand adventure.Donkey Kong Bananza: DK Island & Emerald RushLogan Plant14331:406d ago6d agoDonkey Kong Bananza101:07:576d ago6d agoDonkey Kong Bananza: DK Island & Emerald RushJada Griffin + 3 more12:156d ago6d agoDonkey Kong Bananza: DK Island & Emerald RushLogan Plant + 1 more12:446d ago6d agoDonkey Kong Bananza: DK Island & Emerald Rush16d ago6d ago - Ooo, more banana.Donkey Kong Bananza: DK Island & Emerald RushTom Phillips1576d ago6d ago - The Super Mario Galaxy Movie and games, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond's release date, a physical Virtual Boy, and more!Donkey Kong Bananza: DK Island & Emerald RushAdam Bankhurst6216d ago6d ago - Thumping your chest like it’s 1994.Donkey Kong BananzaSamuel Claiborn73Reviews•Editor Columns•News•Guides•Upcoming Sales Events•How to Watch Guides•Board Game Reviews•GTA 5 Cheats•Best Streaming Bundles•IGN Store•Top Deals•Contact Us•IGN YouTube•HowLongToBeat•IGN TikTok•IGN Twitter•Map Genie•Eurogamer•Rock Paper Shotgun•VG247•Maxroll•Privacy Policy•Terms of Use
