Otherwise, Bananza’s DLC is an enjoyable but inessential expansion to DK and Pauline’s grand adventure.Logan PlantReviewed on Nintendo Switch 2Read ReviewSummarySightsee across this modern take on Donkey Kong’s home, packed with nostalgic views like DK’s Treehouse, Gangplank Galleon, and other iconic locations in the DLC that’s included in this bundle. Take in-game photos with familiar friends Diddy Kong, Dixie Kong, Cranky Kong, Rambi, and Squawks, and decorate DK Island with DLC-exclusive character statues that you can obtain with Banandium Chips. You might even find some hidden bonus stages among the mine cart tracks and jungle ruins!Content RatingDevelopersNintendo EAD Tokyo Software Development DepartmentPublishersNintendoFranchisesDonkey KongInitial ReleaseSep 12, 2025PlatformsGenresAction, Adventure, Platformer, DLC / ExpansionDonkey Kong Bananza: DK Island & Emerald Rush NewsLatestVideosArticlesGameplayTrailersReviews01:47:585d ago5d agoDonkey Kong Bananza: DK Island & Emerald RushBrian Altano + 3 more212:025d ago5d agoDonkey Kong Bananza: DK Island & Emerald RushLogan Plant7d ago7d ago - This roguelite remix is an enjoyable but inessential expansion to DK and Pauline’s grand adventure.Donkey Kong Bananza: DK Island & Emerald RushLogan Plant16031:4012d ago12d agoDonkey Kong Bananza101:07:5712d ago12d agoDonkey Kong Bananza: DK Island & Emerald RushJada Griffin + 3 more12:1512d ago12d agoDonkey Kong Bananza: DK Island & Emerald RushLogan Plant + 1 more12:4412d ago12d agoDonkey Kong Bananza: DK Island & Emerald Rush112d ago12d ago - Ooo, more banana.Donkey Kong Bananza: DK Island & Emerald RushTom Phillips16812d ago12d ago - The Super Mario Galaxy Movie and games, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond's release date, a physical Virtual Boy, and more!Donkey Kong Bananza: DK Island & Emerald RushAdam Bankhurst62812d ago12d ago - Thumping your chest like it’s 1994.Donkey Kong BananzaSamuel Claiborn73Reviews•Editor Columns•News•Guides•Upcoming Sales Events•How to Watch Guides•Board Game Reviews•GTA 5 Cheats•Best Streaming Bundles•IGN Store•Top Deals•Contact Us•IGN YouTube•HowLongToBeat•IGN TikTok•IGN Twitter•Map Genie•Eurogamer•Rock Paper Shotgun•VG247•Maxroll•Privacy Policy•Terms of Use
