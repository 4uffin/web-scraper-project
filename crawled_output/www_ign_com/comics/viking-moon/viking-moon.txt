The real reason the Vikings fled North America! This barbaric adventure begins in 1003, when Leif Erikson established a Viking settlement in Vneland (present day Newfoundland), a strange new world of plenty. But this untamed frontier is populated by more than an indigenous people… This is something unnatural that stalks the night... Twenty years after the original expedition ended in disaster, a new attempt to settle this wilderness is made. Ulf and his hardened tribe of Vikings soon discover that the whisper of creatures who are both human and beast are not primitive legend, but death-bringing reality.PublishersImage ComicsInitial ReleaseSep 24, 2025PlatformsPrintGenresGraphic Novel, Action, FantasyViking Moon NewsLatestArticlesAug 28, 2025Aug 28, 2025 - Two great tastes that go great together in the new Image Comics Series.Viking MoonJesse SchedeenReviews•Editor Columns•News•Guides•Upcoming Sales Events•How to Watch Guides•Board Game Reviews•GTA 5 Cheats•Best Streaming Bundles•IGN Store•Top Deals•Contact Us•IGN YouTube•HowLongToBeat•IGN TikTok•IGN Twitter•Map Genie•Eurogamer•Rock Paper Shotgun•VG247•Maxroll•Privacy Policy•Terms of Use
