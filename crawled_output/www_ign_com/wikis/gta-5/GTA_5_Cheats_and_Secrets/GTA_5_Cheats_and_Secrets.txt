Before you can go entering cheats though, you'll need to decide which cheat code type you want to enter. Here's some information you may want to know about the two different types:
Button Cheats - Available on all gaming platforms - including PC, PS5, PS4, PS3, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and Xbox 360 - you will be required to enter the GTA 5 cheat codes using the gamepad, much like classic GTA games.In order to activate cheats in GTA 5, whether it be PC, Xbox, or PlayStation, here's our step-by-step walkthrough guide for entering and activating cheats in GTA 5:
Start up your copy of GTA 5 and load into the single-player campaign, as cheat codes can only be activated in-game. Once in-game, be sure to save your game because entering cheat codes disables GTA 5 Achievements and Trophies, but only for the current play session. Restarting your game will return your ability to continue collecting and completing Achievement/Trophies. If you have selected the Button Cheats option, use the D-pad to enter the directional commands - such as LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN. These codes must be executed fairly quickly, and if done correctly, a small confirmation will appear above the map. How to Use GTA 5 Phone CheatsShould you opt for the cell phone method, simply follow the steps below to use phone cheats in GTA 5:
Open your phone menu by pressing the Up arrow key or Up on the D-Pad.
Access the dial pad by clicking on Contacts.
Enter your desired cheat code, and dial the number.
If you have entered the correct number and successfully followed these instructions, you'll receive a message stating the cheat has been activated.THERE IS NO "INFINITE MONEY CHEAT"No button cheat or cell phone command exists to spawn money into your account in single-player or GTA Online. However, our Assassination Investor guide can help you earn up to $2.1 Billion in single-player!GTA 5 Cheat Codes Not WorkingIf your cheat codes aren't working in GTA 5, it could be due to the following reasons:
You're not inputting them fast enough. You're not using the D-Pad to input directions (on controller). You're using cheats for the wrong platform.Now that you know all the GTA 5 cheats, check out more of our helpful GTA V guides:
