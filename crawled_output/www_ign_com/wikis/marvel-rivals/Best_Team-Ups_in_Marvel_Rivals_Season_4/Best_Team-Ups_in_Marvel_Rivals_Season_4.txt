Fantastic FourDon't let the name of this team-up fool you, because the whole Fantastic Four isn't needed for it. As a matter of fact, all that's needed is Invisible Woman and one other member of the team. Once you have them selected, the other Fantastic Four members will unlock an ability that allows them to heal themselves.
Throughout the last couple of seasons, the entire Fantastic Four roster has seen various buffs and nerfs that make certain characters harder to play than others. But the two that have been consistently good have been Invisible Woman and The Thing. Giving extra heals to a Tank mid-fight can make or break a lot of key moments in games.
Required Heroes for Fantastic Four
Invisible Woman (Anchor) Human Torch The Thing Mister FantasticPrimal FlameThis is one of those team-ups that is good to have in almost any build. For this, you'll need to have Phoenix and Wolverine. Once both of them are on the team, Wolverine will unlock an ability to channel the Phoenix Force whenever he performs his Feral Leap. This will let him steal life from whoever he attacks and do more damage.
Wolverine has almost always been a standout hero, and this team-up makes him even more dangerous. Give him a damage boost, and healing abilities, and you've just made him easily one of the most dangerous characters in the game. With this team-up, you'll be able to terrorize the backline easily.
Required Heroes for Primal Flame:
Phoenix (Anchor) WolverineStark ProtocolThe Stark Protocol is a bit like Gamma in the sense that it gives different Heroes different abilities. For starters, someone will need to play as Iron Man, and the other two can be Ultron or Squirrel Girl. For Ulton, he'll unlock Nano Ray, an ability that allows him to shoot his beam through allies, which will heal them and damage whatever enemy it touches. Squirrel Girl, on the other hand, will unlock Squirrel Missile, which eventually gives her heat-seeking missiles.
Iron Man has always been a hit-or-miss character. But a well-trained Ultron and Squirrel Girl can easily take down some of the best of us. Even with her nerfs, Squirrel Girl is still a threat on the field, and this team-up makes her even more dangerous and lets her play from the backfield. Meanwhile, Ultron now has even more of a reason to be aggressive while healing his teammates.
Required Heroes for Stark Protocol:
Iron Man (Anchor) Ultron Squirrel GirlLunar ForceSimilar to the Fantastic Four, Lunar Force is another team-up that offers healing abilities. For this, you'll need to have Cloak & Dagger, followed by Moon Knight and Blade. When all of these three are on your team, Moon Knight will unlock an ability called Full Moon, which allows him to turn invisible and heal. Blade gets a similar move called New Moon, which lets him turn invisible and lunge towards enemies.
Moonknight is another case of heroes being constantly good no matter what season it is. The latest buff provided by Cloak & Dagger makes him even more of a threat because he can turn invisible and heal himself. That's all, without mentioning Blade, too. Not only can he do the same, but he can now charge at enemies, making it easier for him to get the jump on people.
Required Heroes for Lunar Force:
Cloak & Dagger (Anchor) Moon Knight BladeRocket NetworkRocket Network is a team-up for anyone looking to do a little more damage. For this one, you'll need to have Rocket Raccoon, Peni Parker, and Star Lord. Once you have them, Peni will unlock an Armored Spider-Nest ability that allows her to drop an extra nest that drops armor packs. Meanwhile, Star-Lord unlocks a new move called
Network Leapspider, which allows him to place a teleporter that can be activated anywhere on the map.
Rocket Network is easily one of the best team-ups added to the game. Not only does it give out extra armor packs, but it also allows Peni to drop an extra nest, which is especially helpful when playing on a Convergence or Domination map. The fact that it also adds Star-Lord to the mix now is a nice cherry on top to help out DPS players.
Required Heroes for Rocket Network:
Rocket Racoon (Anchor) Peni Parker Star-LordVibrant VitalityThe Vibrant Vitality team-up does a little bit of everything. For this, you'll need to have Mantis on your team, followed by Loki and Groot. Loki will unlock an ability called Deific Blessing, which gives allies a damage buff whenever they are in his healing area. Groot, however, will unlock Wild Wall. This will not only project you like his normal walls will, but it will also heal nearby allies.
Groot and Loki have always been some top-tier characters to master. And Vibrant Vitality only makes them shine even more. Because it's safe to assume that most of the time when Groot puts up a wall, someone will be taking damage, and when Loki is healing, they'll be attacking an enemy. So why not get the most out of it while doing either one?
Required Heroes for Vibrant Vitality:
Mantis (Anchor) Loki GrootRagnarok RebirthRagnarok Rebirth is an ideal team-up for people looking to get an extra bang for their buck with Thor. You'll need Hela and Thor on the same team to use it. Once both are selected, Hela will unlock a passive called Queen of Hel. This will allow her to either instantly respawn Thor when he's killed or grant him an extra HP by landing a final hit on an enemy.
This one is fairly straightforward as to why it's one of the best. Being able to bring back Thor as soon as he dies is extremely helpful. It almost goes without saying, but it's extremely important to have a tank on the field at all times, and being able to bring him back right away is amazing.
Required Heroes for Ragnarok Rebirth:
Hela (Anchor) ThorArcane OrderArcane Order is a great team-up for those looking to do extra damage for Duelist heroes. You'll need Doctor Strange, followed by Magik and Scarlet Witch for this. When these characters are on the field, Magik will unlock an ability called Chain of Cyttorak that'll let her chain two nearby enemies together while damaging them. And Scarlet Witch will gain Sorcery Surge, a move that replaces her Chthonian Burst.
Doctor Stange is a gift that keeps on giving. He works in almost any list, and his buffs to Magik and Scarlet Witch further prove that. Allowing Magik to chain up to enemies together is the perfect thing to do whenever she's trying to attack healers in the backfield. That's without mentioning the new attack Scarlet Witch gets that allows her to dish out more damage.
Required Heroes for Arcane Order:
Doctor Strange (Anchor) Magik Scarlet WitchGamma ChargeGamma Charge is another team-up that's ideal for giving Duelist heroes an extra one-up. You'll need to have Hulk on your team, followed by Namor and/or Black Panther. When this team-up is in play, Namor will unlock an ability called Gamma Monstro that does more damage the longer it shoots an enemy. Black Panther will unlock a new passive called Gamma Vibranium Armor. This will trigger whenever his health is low, and he'll receive a gamma shield to block any attack.
Gamma Charge has seen many changes since its debut, and has always been good. With Namor alone, you can essentially shut down any dive player trying to attack you, and now, if you are running Dive, you can have a fighting chance thanks to Black Panther's buff.
Required Heroes for Gamma Charge:
