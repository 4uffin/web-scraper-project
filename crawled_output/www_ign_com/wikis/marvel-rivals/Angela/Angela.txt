It takes some practice to get used to that setup and that, combined with her two different attack modes, are why she’s rated four stars in difficulty. She's somewhat more fragile than other tanks, relying on her agility as much as her shield to stay safe. Like other highly mobile tanks such as the Hulk or Venom, she’s access at hit and run attacks on healers on enemy backlines, though she can hold her own in standup fights too if well supported by healers.
Axe Of Ichors (Ground)On foot, she switches to the Axes of Ichors. These swing in a small arc in front of her, and the fourth swing of her combo lunges her forward slightly, which makes it great for pursuing fleeing enemies.

Spear of Ichors (Air)When flying, Angela’s default attack is the Spear of Ichors, a melee thrust directly in front of her. It’s range is pretty long for a melee attack, and it has a more generous hit box than the linear path of her thrust would indicate.

Under her reticle is the Attack Charge gauge. This is filled by flying (not hovering), or by blocking incoming damage with her shield. As the meter increases, so to does her damage output. When it is maximized, her Spear of Ichors hits especially hard, and launches enemies into the air. Assassin’s ChargeAngela’s R1 attack is the Assassin’s Charge. This is only available while flying. When you activate it, she accelerates forward with her spear thrust ahead of her. During this she cannot be knocked back or launched into the air.
If you manage to catch an enemy on the tip of your spear you can take them with you, giving it an effect somewhat similar to Wolverine’s Feral Leap. It also works as a great tool for escape, and, if you time it just right, can be used to send an enemy into a pit to their death.

The cooldown for Assassin’s Charge is only three seconds, but pay attention to this meter too. This dictates how long you can charge for, and take longer to fully recover. Divine JudgementPressing L1 while flying activates Angela’s Divine Judgment ability, and this does a lot. First, it makes her dive down to the ground and switch to her Axes of Ichors for some grounded combat. Next, it creates a Divine Judgment Zone. Enemies within take damage, and any damage you deal generates bonus damage for you and allies in the Divine Judgement Zone.
This is the “I’ve softened you up enough, now it’s time to wreck your day” move. You even get a boost to movement speed as an added bonus, isn’t that nice?
Press L1 again while you are on the ground, and Angela takes flight once again. You can do this immediately after landing, but after this Divine Judgment has a long, 12 second cooldown before you can use it again.

Shielded StanceHitting L2 brings up Angela’s shield. This can block up to 350 points of damage and will change your Attack Charge gauge. It works the same flying or on foot, and there is no limit to how long you can hold it up as long as it still has health.
It will start to regenerate its health a few seconds after being stowed, and either a two second cooldown if you put it away before it breaks, or a four second timer if it gets shattered. You have full mobility while the shield is up, making it a great tool for closing on enemies firing at you from range.

Heaven’s Retribution (Ultimate)Angela’s ultimate attack is Heaven’s Retribution. Not only does this have maybe the coolest name of any ultimate in Rivals, it’s also a perfect fit for her backline attacking style. When activated, Angela throws her spear forward. Enemies in a radius around it are then trapped by ribbons extending from her planted spear. Activate her ultimate again and she will leap right into the middle of that area, activating a Divine Judgement Zone, and all that comes with it, in the process.
In effect, a group of enemies is trapped within reach of your axes, taking damage while healing you in the process. It’s nasty, in the best kind of way.

Angela Team-UpsAngela’s buddy for Team up’s is Thor. While Angela doesn’t get any perks, she does empower the God of Thunder with a throwable Thunder Spear that can generate Thorforce when striking enemies. Thor can then launch a follow-up, leaping to smash his hammer on the spear, generating a shockwave for additional damage. It’s the sort of extra trick that is sure to make an Angela user a Thor main’s best friend. Angela will take a bit of practice to get down, but in skilled hands she is going to be a menace with these attacks.
