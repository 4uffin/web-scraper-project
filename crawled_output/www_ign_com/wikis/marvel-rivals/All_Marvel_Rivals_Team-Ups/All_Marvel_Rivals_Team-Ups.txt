Planet X PalsPlanet X Pals allows Rocket Racoon and Jeff the Land Shark to ride on Groot's shoulders, all while receiving damage reduction.
Required Heroes for Planet X Pals:
Groot (Anchor) Rocket Racoon Jeff the Land SharkFastball SpecialAs the name implies for this one, you'll be throwing a small thing very fast. This team-up is a great way to have Wolverine get to the backfield extremely fast; all that's needed is a good throw, and he'll be flying across the map in no time. What's unique about this team-up is that it has two anchors with The Thing and Hulk, and both perform the same task.
Required Heroes for Fastball Special:
The Thing (Anchor) Hulk (Anchor) Wolverine Fantastic FourDon't let the name of this team-up fool you, because the whole Fantastic Four isn't needed for it. As a matter of fact, all that's needed is Invisible Woman and one other member of the team. Once you have them selected, the other Fantastic Four members will unlock an ability that allows them to heal themselves.
Required Heroes for Fantastic Four
Invisible Woman (Anchor) Human Torch The Thing Mister FantasticStars AlignedFor Stars Aligned, you'll need both Captain America and the Winder Soldier for this to work. When it's activated, they'll both lunge towards one another, damage whatever enemies may be near, and receive a slight health increase.
Required Heroes for Stars Aligned:
Captain America (Anchor) Winter Soldier (Anchor)Mental ProjectionMental Projection is a great team-up whenever you want to confuse your enemies, because it creates a duplicate of your team members and even does damage. Emma Frost needs to be in the lineup to use this team-up. Once you have someone playing as her, you can have Magneto and/or Psylocke on the same team.
Required Heroes for Mental Projection:
Emma Frost (Anchor) Magento PsylockePrimal FlameThis is one of those team-ups that is good to have in almost any build. For this, you'll need to have Phoenix and Wolverine. Once both of them are on the team, Wolverine will unlock an ability to channel the Phoenix Force whenever he performs his Feral Leap. This will let him steal life from whoever he attacks and do more damage.
Required Heroes for Primal Flame:
Phoenix (Anchor) WolverineDivine ArmoryWith Divine Armory, you'll make Thor even more mobile than he already is. For this, you'll need Angela and Thor. Once those two are on the team, Thor will unlock an ability that'll allow him to throw a spear on the ground and lunge towards it. He'll damage any nearby enemies as soon as he lands on it.
Required Heroes for Divine Armory:
Angela (Anchor) ThorOperation: MicrochipOperation: Microchip is a fairly straightforward team-up. For this, you'll need to have Punisher and Black Widow on your team. Once both heroes are selected, Black Widow will unlock a new ability called Pulse Rifle, which gives her straight-shooter piercing damage.
Required Heroes for Operation: Microchip:
Punisher (Anchor) Black WidowJeff-NadoJeff-Nado is a very powerful team-up when in action. For this to activate, you'll need a couple of things. The first is someone on Storm and Jeff. After that, they'll both need to have their ultimates active at the same time. Once those requirements are met, Jeff will fly into Storm's ult and damage anyone inside it, then spit them out once the ult is finished.
Required Heroes for Jeff-Nado:
Storm (Anchor) Jeff the Land SharkEver-Burning BondFor Ever-Burning Bond, you'll need someone to play as Human Torch and Spider-Man. Once both Heroes are selected, Spider-Man will unlock an ability called Inferno Blast that allows him to shoot fire webs while doing a back flip to create some distance.
Required Heroes for Ever-Burning Bond:
Human Torch (Anchor) Spider-ManStark ProtocolThe Stark Protocol is a bit like Gamma in the sense that it gives different Heroes different abilities. For starters, someone will need to play as Iron Man, and the other two can be Ultron or Squirrel Girl. For Ulton, he'll unlock Nano Ray, an ability that allows him to shoot his beam through allies, which will heal them and damage whatever enemy it touches. Squirrel Girl, on the other hand, will unlock Squirrel Missile, which eventually gives her heat-seeking missiles.
Required Heroes for Stark Protocol:
Iron Man (Anchor) Ultron Squirrel GirlSymbiote ShenanigansSymbiote Shenanigans is another team-up that gives different characters different abilities. For this, you'll need to have Venom on your team, as well as Hela and Jeff the Land Shark. Hella will unlock Hel Tendrils, which will let her shoot an orb that'll pull back nearby enemies. Jeff, however, will unlock Guardian of the Deep, which lets him share life links with nearby allies that'll heal them.
Required Heroes for Symbiote Shenaigans:
Venom (Anchor) Hela Jeff the Land SharkLunar ForceSimilar to the Fantastic Four, Lunar Force is another team-up that offers healing abilities. For this, you'll need to have Cloak & Dagger, followed by Moon Knight and Blade.

Blade gets a similar move called New Moon, which lets him turn invisible and lunge towards enemies.

For this, you'll need to have Luna Snow as well as Hawkeye and Iron Fist. Hawkeye will unlock an ability called Ice Arrow that lets him stun enemies or slow them down.

Rocket Raccoon (Anchor) Peni Parker Star-LordDuality DanceThis is a great team-up for keeping your healers alive a bit longer. For this one, you'll need to have Adam Warlock and Luna Snow on your team. Once both heroes are selected, Luna Snow will unlock an ability called Light & Shadow Karma. When she uses this power, she'll link to an enemy; when she damages them, she'll begin to heal.
Required Heroes for Duality Dance:
Adam Warlock (Anchor) Luna SnowVibrant VitalityThe Vibrant Vitality team-up does a little bit of everything. For this, you'll need to have Mantis on your team, followed by Loki and Groot. Loki will unlock an ability called Deific Blessing, which gives allies a damage buff whenever they are in his healing area. Groot, however, will unlock Wild Wall. This will not only project you like his normal walls will, but it will also heal nearby allies.
Required Heroes for Vibrant Vitality:
Mantis (Anchor) Loki GrootFirst StepsFirst Steps is a great team-up for looking to stagger the enemy backfield. This works much like Fastball Special, but instead of throwing Wolverine in the back, it's now The Thing. This team-up is inspired by the latest MCU film Fantastic Four: First Steps, when Human Torch carries The Thing. When The Thing is dropped, he'll damage any nearby enemies and disable any mobility moves they may have.
Required Heroes for First Steps:
Human Torch (Anchor) The Thing (Anchor)Ragnarok RebirthRagnarok Rebirth is an ideal team-up for people looking to get an extra bang for their buck with Thor.

This will allow her to either instantly respawn Thor when he's killed or grant him an extra HP by landing a final hit on an enemy.

And Scarlet Witch will gain Sorcery Surge, a move that replaces her Chthonian Burst.

Doctor Strange (Anchor) Magik Scarlet WitchGamma ChargeGamma Charge is another team-up that's ideal for giving Duelist heroes an extra one-up. You'll need to have Hulk on your team, followed by Namor and/or Black Panther. When this team-up is in play, Namor will unlock an ability called Gamma Monstro that does more damage the longer it shoots an enemy. Black Panther will unlock a new passive called Gamma Vibranium Armor. This will trigger whenever his health is low, and he'll receive a gamma shield to block any attack.
