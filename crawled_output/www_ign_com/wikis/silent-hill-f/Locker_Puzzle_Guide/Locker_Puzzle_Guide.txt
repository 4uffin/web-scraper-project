This ordinarily wouldn't be a big deal, but their numerical cipher holds the key to a required locker combination. Here's how to break the "girl code" in Silent Hill f.
Silent Hill f School Locker Puzzle GuideYour goal in Ebisugaoka Middle School is to find the key to the back gate, but due to a combination of the vice principal's haplessness and everyday problems, there are several layers of accidental security between you and that key. There's a security cabinet in the office on the 1F lobby that's the first place you ought to look, but it's locked and the key's nowhere in sight.
Once you solve the Secret Box puzzle, you can use the Second Floor Generic Classroom Key to open the two locked classrooms on the east end of 2F. The closest of the two has the Note to Teacher file on the podium, which tells you a girl named Ayumi found a lost key but left it in her locker. Examining it also gets you the Old Annex Main Gate Key.
At this point, you can go downstairs and use that key to enter the Annex on the north side of 1F. There are two unlocked classrooms up here, both of which and the hall are littered with leftover notes from the students. These provide some examples of how to translate the students' unique cipher, also known as "girl code." As it turns out, many of the students have used "girl code" for their locker combinations.
Ayumi's classroom is on the west end of the Annex. You can check the teacher's podium for a seating chart, then go to Ayumi's desk to find Asakura's Textbook and the Locker Room Key, which opens the girls' side of the 1F locker room.
You can now access both sides of the locker room and open Ayumi's locker, once you know her encoded combination. Fortunately, she's left a clue about it in her textbook; unfortunately, it's in "girl code."
Girl Code for DummiesAt least in the English translation of SHf, the "girl code" breaks down like these students invented l33tspeak a full 25 years early. You can see it in use in multiple documents found throughout the Annex.
To translate messages that have been encoded, exchange letters with similar-looking numbers or punctuation marks, and vice versa. Thus, 1 = I, 3 = E, 4 = A, and so on.
In order to figure out Ayumi's combination, you'll need to take a clue from her textbook and run it through the "girl code" translator. The actual code changes between puzzle difficulties.
Successfully opening Ayumi's locker rewards you with the Key Cabinet Key, which can be used in the school's office to obtain the Key to the Back Mountains.
Story Mode Solution"I'm a mermaid. The sea is calling out to me. I can't believe this school doesn't even have a pool!"The sea! THE SEA! The best thing in the world! It's so lovely, it's now my locker combination!"Ayumi's locker combination on Story difficulty is "SEA" in code: Tap to Reveal.
Hard Mode Solution"I'm a tortoise. The bus is calling out to me. I didn't get the news that school would be so far away!"Bus! BUS! The best thing in the world! I love it so much that I made it my locker combination!"This is the trickiest of the 3 difficulties. In order to figure out all 3 digits of the code, you'll need a clue found in the Note from a Male Student file, which is typically found on the west end of the Annex hallway on an overgrown side table.
Tap to Reveal That means Ayumi's locker combination on Hard difficulty is Tap to Reveal.Lost in the Fog Mode Solution"I decided to make the combo for my locker something I love!"You can poach it, fry it, and even boil it. No matter what, it always comes out delicious!"And if you add flour and sugar and mix them all together, you can make a cake!"You're looking for a 3-letter word for a type of food that can be poached or fried and which is an ingredient in cakes.
Ayumi's locker combination on Lost in the Fog difficulty is Tap to Reveal.
Optional SolutionsYou only need to open Ayumi's locker in order to make progress, but there are three more lockers that you can open, which belong to Suga Yosie, Takeshi Aoi, and Tschuiya Taiko. These combinations do not change between puzzle difficulties, and both Suga and Taiko are holding onto useful items.
Aoi's Combination: Once you find Ayumi's classroom in the Annex, check the cubbyholes at the back of the room to find an Origami of Grievances. According to its author, Aoi's locker combination is his own first name translated into girl code.
Takeshi Aoi's locker combination is Tap to Reveal. Open it to find another Origami of Grievances.
Suga's Combination: As per the Origami of Grievances we just found in Aoi's locker, Suga's combination "sounds like a cry for help." You won't get any more clues than that, but if you think about it, there's an obvious 3-digit distress signal that more or less everyone knows.
Suga Yosie's locker combination is Tap to Reveal. Open it to find a School Bag, which expands Hinako's inventory limit by 1. On subsequent NG+ runs, Suga's locker contains a valuable Shriveled Abu-age offering instead.
Taiko's Combination: Use the Generic Classroom Key to open the northern classroom on the east end of the second floor. The classroom is mostly empty, but there's an origami crane on top of a stack of books in the back that turns out to be an Origami of Grievances. Read it to get Taiko's locker combination, courtesy of an unnamed rival.
Tschuiya Taiko's locker combination is Tap to Reveal. Open it to receive the Omamori [Wolf]. On subsequent runs, this is replaced with a Dried Carcass.
A note for speedrunners: on NG+, the girls' locker room is always open as soon as you reach the middle school lobby, with no need to hunt down its key. There's also nothing to keep you from immediately opening Ayumi's locker and skipping 80% of the school. However, you do get jumped by a bunch of scarecrows the moment you have the Key Cabinet Key, so you know. Look forward to that.Up Next: Editions and Pre-Order BonusesPreviousStairwell Puzzle GuideNextEditions and Pre-Order BonusesTop Guide SectionsWalkthroughPuzzle GuideEditions and Pre-Order BonusesPC System RequirementsWas this guide helpful?Leave feedbackIn This GuideSilent Hill fNeobards EntertainmentSep 25, 2025Learn moreGo to commentsReviews•Editor Columns•News•Guides•Upcoming Sales Events•How to Watch Guides•Board Game Reviews•GTA 5 Cheats•Best Streaming Bundles•IGN Store•Top Deals•Contact Us•IGN YouTube•HowLongToBeat•IGN TikTok•IGN Twitter•Map Genie•Eurogamer•Rock Paper Shotgun•VG247•Maxroll•Privacy Policy•Terms of Use
