To escape from this part of the shrine and go on with the game, you'll need to organize 5 strange offerings. It's just a question of figuring out how, and that's what we're here to help with.
Silent Hill f: Altar Puzzle GuideOnce you're up and moving, there's nothing else to do in this room but approach and examine the altar. There's a folded piece of paper on the table in front of it that provides a hint about how to progress, but on Story/Hard, it doesn't offer very much insight.
On each difficulty, the goal of the Altar puzzle is to place the 5 offerings on the correct 5 podiums. Once you successfully put every offering in its appropriate place, you'll automatically continue with the level.
You'll always have the same 5 offerings to choose from: a dead rat, a dried fish, a little sculpted doll robe, a clay urn, and what looks like a box with chopsticks in it.
Story Mode SolutionThis is a simple test of pattern recognition. Examine each of the offerings, then the 5 podiums in front of you, and see how their decorations might line up.
Each of the offerings has a knotted cord on it somewhere. Compare the style of the knot to the symbols that are painted on the sides of the podiums.
Place the robe, urn, and chopsticks on the front row from left to right, then put the rat on the back left podium and the dried fish on the back right, like so:
Hard Mode SolutionThe offerings haven't changed, but there are now different symbols on the sides of the podiums, each of which is based on a different native Japanese plant. You'll need to examine each offering in search of a matching pattern or logo, but some of them are hard to spot.
The urn has a chrysanthemum painted on its bottom.
The chopsticks feature a bamboo leaf design on the side of their box. The dead rat is wrapped in big green leaves. The robe has a floral pattern painted along its lower half which resembles plum blossoms. It's more obvious if you rotate it and look at it from the back. The dried fish has a subtle pattern on the orange paper beneath the knot in its cord.From left to right, place the chopsticks, urn, and dead rat in the front row, then place the dried fish on the back left podium and the robe on the back right, as above.
Lost in the Fog Mode SolutionThere are no markings on the Altar podiums at all when you play on Lost in the Fog. Instead, you have to figure out which offering goes where based upon a new hint that's written on the paper in front of the altar:
"Kudzu, respected by all and a leader of the people, was wed to Pine."Plum, loved by all and always at the center of any group, was wed to Bamboo."Chrysanthemum, who had no mate, spent their days studying under Kudzu and became known as the '<meta />Sage of the East.'"Let the prosperity of our clan be eternal."This is an inference puzzle. You're supposed to figure out the offerings' positions based upon a couple of solid facts and some related information. Going step by step:
The robe has plum blossoms painted on it. Since Plum is loved by all, it should be placed in the middle. The urn has a flower design on its bottom, so it's Chrysanthemum, which goes on the easternmost podium: lower right. The dead rat is wrapped in leaves and kudzu is the only leafy plant here. Since Chrysanthemum is studying under Kudzu, the dead rat has to be placed above the urn, on the top right. The dried fish has pine needles on it, so since Pine and Kudzu are married, it goes on the top left. That leaves the chopsticks, which by process of elimination, must be Bamboo. They belong next to their spouse Plum, on the bottom left.The puzzle should end up looking like this right before it's solved:
That completes the toughest version of the Altar puzzle and lets you move on to the Shrine Path.
