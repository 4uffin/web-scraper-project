During version 6.0, you can claim Primogems, free Wishes, and even a free 5-star character as part of the anniversary rewards.
Don’t want to miss any gifts? Here’s an overview of all Genshin Impact 6.0 anniversary rewards, to be claimed around the game’s anniversary on September 28, 2025.
Free Genshin Impact Permanent 5-Star CharacterTo claim your free 5-Star character in Genshin Impact, log in, go to the events menu, and click the “Uncover Lunar Realms, Hone the Eventide Radiance” banner to claim any standard 5-Star character for your roster. This includes every 5-Star on the Wanderlust Invocation wish banner: Jean, Diluc, Mona, Qiqi, Keqing, Dehya, Tighnari, and Mizuki.
From the start of the event on September 10, you’ve got 40 days to claim your free character. Additionally, you have until December 1st, 2025, to claim a free Stella Fortuna for one of 18 event-exclusive 5-Star characters through the "To Temper Thyself and Journey Far" event.
1,600 PrimogemsA whopping total of 1,600 Primogems will be sent to you via in-game mail on Genshin Impact’s anniversary. Besides the Primogems, you’ll receive a Sanctifying Elixir, 2x Fragile Resin, the Rotor Hovering Daybed mount-like gadget, and the Ujola Cat companion gadget.
10x Intertwined FateThrough a daily log-in event that’ll last for seven days, you can claim a total of 10 Intertwined Fates, which translates to 10 free Wishes on any limited-time character or weapon banner.
You can also claim the Dust of Enlightenment material, 8x Hero’s Wit, and 80,000 Mora.
Masterless Stella FortunaThis is a permanent feature that arrives alongside the anniversary rewards. From now on, when you receive a duplicate 5-Star character, you get a Masterless Stella Fortuna (instead of normal Stella Fortuna) to increase any level 90 character's level cap to 95. You can do this twice per character, raising the max character level in Genshin Impact to level 100.
