As 5-Star items are typically very rare, make sure you don’t miss out on this Genshin Impact anniversary gift!
Here's how to get your free character in Genshin Impact 6.0.
How to Get a Free 5-Star Character in Genshin Impact 6.0Once version 6.0 has arrived on September 10, 2025, you have 40 days to log in and claim your free 5-star character from the event menu. In the event menu, click the “Uncover Lunar Realms, Hone the Eventide Radiance” tab and then “invite” to select the 5-Star character of your choice.
Note that you can only choose 5-Star characters from the Wanderlust Invocation wish banner, which includes Jean, Diluc, Mona, Qiqi, Keqing, Dehya, Tighnari, and Mizuki.
Instead of obtaining a brand-new character, it’s also possible to pick one you already have, and thus gain a Constellation level.
Whichever free 5-Star character you choose, they’ll be accompanied by a full set of ascension materials.
How to Claim a Free 5-Star Stella Fortuna in Genshin ImpactOn top of the free standard 5-Star character, you can claim a free Stella Fortuna for one of 18 event-exclusive 5-Star characters. This includes nearly all 5-Star characters released before the Fontaine update (version 4.0).
Beware that claiming a Stella Fortuna is not the same as claiming a free 5-Star character; a Stella Fortuna will upgrade the Constellation Level of a 5-Star character you already have. It's the same as obtaining a 5-Star character for the second (or third, or fourth...) time from a Wish banner. This means your choice of character is limited to the 5-Stars you've previously pulled.
To claim the Stella Fortuna, open the game and go to the event menu, then click on the "To Temper Thyself and Journey Far" event. Click "switch choice" to select your preferred 5-Star character to collect the Stella Fortuna for.
Next, complete five daily training goals per week, for a total of eight weeks (there are 12 weeks in this event period). Every daily commission and every 120 Resin spent per day contributes to the daily training goals.
To participate in this event, you must meet the following requirements:
Have an Adventure Rank of 14 or higher Complete the Archon Quest Prologue, Act I: The Outlander Who Caught the Wind Complete the World Quest "Welcome to the Adventurers' Guild"You've got until December 1st, 2025, to claim your 5-star Stella Fortunis in the "To Temper Thyself and Journey Far" event.
