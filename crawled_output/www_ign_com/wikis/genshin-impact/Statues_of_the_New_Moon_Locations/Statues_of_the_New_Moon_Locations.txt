This guide lists every Statue of the New Moon location added in Genshin Impact 6.0.
All Genshin Impact Nod-Krai Statue LocationsThe first Statue of the New Moon stands in Nasha Town, on Lempo Isle. When you arrive in Nod-Krai for the first time, simply walk through this town, towards the northwest, to find this Statue.
The second Statue of the New Moon is on Hiisi Island, west of the previous Statue. If you walk past the Clink-Clank Krumkake Craftshop towards the west, you’ll see the Hiisi Island Statue of the Seven on the southeastern coast, near Frostmoon Enclave.
The third Statue of the Seven added in Genshin Impact 6.0, is on Paha Isle in the north. It’s on the beach southeast of the Kuuvahki Experimental Design Bureau. The easiest way to get there is to cross the ocean north of Lempo Isle.
