There’s plenty to see and do as soon as the game opens up, but that means it might be a little tricky to know which direction to start running in in search of quality loot and the eternal glory that comes with finding the vault. If you’re struggling with picking a direction, here are nine things to do first when you start Borderlands 4.
9 Things to Do First in Borderlands 4Carefully Read Character AffinitiesWhen starting a new game, it can sometimes feel like a bit of a chore to immediately have to do some reading; however, it’s a good idea to pay close attention to the character affinities each Vault Hunter has before picking one. Each of the four starting classes are pretty common character archetypes, but you’ll want to think about what your preferred playstyle might be before you choose one to stick with.
For example, Amon is a close-quarters fighter who can tank a lot of damage and dishes it out with shotguns and heavy-hitting melee attacks, while Vex is able to clone herself to multiply her damage dealt and break the focus of large enemy groups.
Luckily, if you’re having difficulty choosing, we’ve made a full breakdown of the Vault Hunters in our guide on Which Character Should You Choose in Borderlands 4. That said, if you’re new to the Borderlands series, you can’t really go wrong with any character you pick.
Get the Digirunner ASAPBorderlands 4 has a giant map for eager Vault Hunters to explore. Getting around on foot, however, can take a lot of time, and a lot of missions and side objectives will have you changing locations at least once. That’s why it’s a good idea to try and get the Digirunner as soon as you possibly can.
The Digirunner is a motorcycle of sorts that can instantly be summoned almost anywhere at the push of a button, and it makes traversing between objectives incredibly quick and easy. You don’t get the Digirunner right off the bat; however, you’ll need to progress the main story until the mission “Down and Outbound” where Conway will give you the vehicle free of charge.
While you certainly can complete as many of the game’s initial side missions as you like, it’s not a bad idea to hold off on doing them until you have the runner.
In addition to being a fast way of getting from place to place, the Digirunner is also outfitted with a handful of weapons that can take down small groups of enemies when you finally get to your destination. It’s not particularly overpowered, but it can help start a firefight off on the right foot.
Keep An Eye Out For Fishing SpotsAll the best video games have fishing minigames, and now Borderlands 4 is taking a swing at it. As you explore Kairos, you’ll find bodies of water with small areas that have bubbles coming to the surface. If you approach them, you’ll be prompted to start fishing. Luckily, fishing is a pretty simple endeavor, certainly not something too challenging for an accomplished Vault Hunter, but while it’s an activity that might be easy to overlook, it’s a really helpful mechanic for those in the early hours of the game.
Each time you catch a fish, you’ll pull out a small handful of random loot of varying rarities. If you’re not happy with the weapons you’re using or the grenades you’re throwing, take a few minutes to find a body of water and do some fishing to freshen up your loadout.
You won’t catch something good every time you cast your line (in fact, you’ll definitely catch your fair share of literal garbage), but it’s always a good idea to fish when you see spots for it.
Prioritize Upgrading Your SDUStorage Deck Upgrades are some of the most important upgrades you’ll make in Borderlands 4. Unlike navigating your Vault Hunter’s skill tree, however, the SDU is incredibly straightforward: each upgrade increases the amount of ammo, lost loot, or items in your bank you can hold.
From the very moment that Borderlands 4 starts, you’ll be showered in guns and grenades and Repkits and heavy weapons and shields and items of all kinds, so your backpack is going to fill up really fast. Similarly, you’ll find yourself running low on ammo as the firefights you encounter get bigger and longer, but if you head to the SDU menu, you’ll be able to fix both of these issues.
In the Storage Deck Upgrade menu, you’ll see eight categories that you’re able to upgrade using upgrade modules. Each upgrade increases the amount of space in your inventory for that specific item. It’s up to you to choose which option to upgrade, so it’s a good idea to focus on increasing your backpack size ASAP while you discover which weapon type will work best with your build.
From there, you should prioritize increasing the ammo you can hold for your preferred weapons. You’ll get upgrade modules as you complete objectives and find collectibles hidden throughout the world, so it’s a good idea to check back in the SDU menu every so often to upgrade.
Pay Attention To Alt FireThere are literally billions, yes, billions with a “B”, of guns in Borderlands 4, each with its own specific abilities and particularities. One important thing to pay attention to as you try out weapons in search of your favorite Ripper-killing machine is your gun’s alt-fire mode.
Given the overwhelming number of guns in the game, we can’t list every alt-fire option here, but if you look below the ammo counter on your HUD when holding a weapon, if your gun has an alt-fire mode, it’ll be listed there. Some common alt-fire modes are things like switching to different ammo types, shooting energy shields, and adding additional barrels to increase fire rates.
If you experiment with alt-fire modes, you’ll realize just how versatile your weapon roster is, and you can stretch the usefulness of the four weapons you can hold at once out even further.
Remember to Use Your JetpackEarly on in Borderlands 4, you’ll get access to a jetpack that lets you cross wide gaps and hover for a few seconds. While the pack is a solid tool for traversal, it’s important to remember that it can be useful in combat too. Jumping and hovering adds a new plane for you to attack enemies from, and gives you an edge when fighting melee-focused enemies who prioritize AoE attacks and ground slams.
Additionally, the jetpack gives you a dash that can be used to dart in and out of cover, escape explosions, and push into enemy mobs, increasing the pressure. When hovering, you can also perform a ground slam to damage enemies below you by holding the dash button.
Remember to Equip an Action SkillAs you level up and start putting skill points into your Vault Hunter’s upgrade trees, you’ll want to remember that you need to manually equip one of your character’s three Action Skills in the Skills menu.
Action Skills are abilities special to each character that can help you turn the tide in a battle. They’re super helpful and a main pillar for what makes each Vault Hunter unique; however, the game isn’t going to equip the skill for you, you’ll need to manually select the skill at the top of the tree to have access to it.
This also applies to Capstones, which you also need to manually select once you unlock them in the Skill Tree after investing a certain number of Skill Points.Use Mission Replay For Extra RewardsBorderlands 4 introduces the ability to replay missions that you’ve completed for extra rewards. When you’re early in the game, it’s not a bad idea to replay a mission or two if you’re looking to get a few new guns and skill points from the mission rewards. Take note that not every mission can be replayed; however, usually the missions that net you the most new loot, money, eridium, and XP can be replayed.
To replay a mission, simply head to the “Missions” tab in the menu and then tab over to the “Replay” sub-menu. Select the mission you want to replay, and you’ll load into it.
Give Abduction Injunction a ShotSpeaking of side missions, if you’re looking for a good mission to try early on in Borderlands 4, Abduction Injunction is a great place to start. Available as soon as you gain access to the open world after claiming your first safehouse by heading north out of the safehouse and talking with Wildhorn Jenny, the side mission will have you chasing a strange UFO that seems to be abducting Wildhorns.
While the rewards for completing the mission itself aren’t much to write home about, the mission will have you running all over the Coastal Bonescape, introducing you to several points of interest and intersecting with a handful of other side quests. As far as getting your feet wet with everything Borderlands 4 has to offer, Abduction Injunction is a solid way to get rolling with early side quests, characters, and points of interest.
