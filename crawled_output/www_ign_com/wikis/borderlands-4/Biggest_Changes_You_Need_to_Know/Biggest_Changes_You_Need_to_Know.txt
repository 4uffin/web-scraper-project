But while the game is definitely still Borderlands through and through, there are several differences that set it apart from past installments. If you’re sitting on the fence about diving into the new Borderlands game, here are all of the biggest changes in Borderlands 4 that might just tip you over the edge.
Weapon Wheel Dash and Double Jump Resetting Bosses Grapple Hook Repkits Instant Vehicle Summoning Difficulty Settings Equipped Weapon Warning Hologram Path Combat Radar Weapon WheelSwitching weapons mid-combat is easier than ever with Borderlands 4’s brand new weapon wheel. The weapon wheel sits in the bottom right-hand corner of the screen, showing you all four weapons that you have equipped. But not only does it offer a nice snapshot of your arsenal so you know what weapons you’re working with, it also gives you the flexibility to swiftly change weapons whenever you want.
The weapon wheel is a small change that makes a massive difference in-game. It makes combat smoother than ever, so you don’t skip a beat when switching weapons. Whether you want to change from a long to a short-range weapon, or the one you’re using has run out of ammo, you can change to the next one in an instant.
Dash and Double JumpDash is a brand new dodging mechanic introduced in Borderlands 4. It is not explicitly explained to you in-game, but as soon as you unlock the Hoverpack, you unlock the ability to dash, too. You can dash to the front, back, and either side, offering you a fast and efficient way to avoid enemy attacks.
In addition to dashing, you can also double jump in Borderlands 4. This offers tons more flexibility in terms of both exploration and combat. Double jumps can be used to evade attacks, gain higher ground over an enemy, or reach new areas you couldn’t otherwise reach with a boring single jump.
Resetting BossesOne of the best new features in Borderlands 4 is the ability to reset bosses. This allows you to farm them endlessly and gain incredible amounts of HP and loot quickly and easily. This new feature is introduced via the Moxxi's Big Encore machine, accessible after completing the main story.
The Encore Machine is available in the Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode hub and makes grinding in the post-game far less frustrating and essentially stress-free. Replaying bosses does cost Eridium, but that’s a small price to pay for such an epic mechanic! You can also find weekly challenges there to further test your Borderlands 4 mettle.
Grapple HookThe double jump we covered earlier already makes exploration in Borderlands 4 more interesting, but the grapple hook makes it even more diverse. The grapple hook is unlocked during the first hour or so of the game and can be used to reach areas even higher than your double jump allows.
The grapple hook does have some limits, and you can only grapple to certain points, but it is a game-changer for both exploration and combat. Grappling to new areas gives you the higher ground over your enemies and gains you access to new paths. If you’re ever stuck in a quest and you’re not sure where to go, try looking up! There might be a grapple point right there waiting for you.
RepkitsRepkits are easily one of the best changes introduced in Borderlands 4. Repkits are items that you can equip and use in combat to gain health back instantly and on your own terms, provided enough time has passed for the cooldown to be complete. They are true lifesavers in combat and allow you the opportunity to dash off, out of harm’s way, and quickly heal before jumping back into battle.
This is much faster and easier than scampering around, trying to spot health drops while simultaneously dodging bullets or landing a successful Transfusion Grenade. There are also plenty of different Repkits that you can collect. These vary in terms of effectiveness, giving you even more loot to find and use to customize your loadout.
Instant Vehicle SummoningAnother extremely handy quality of life improvement found in Borderlands 4 is instant vehicle summoning. Borderlands 4 has you embarking on some epic adventures that can take you all throughout Kairos, covering some serious ground. And thankfully, you can summon your vehicle whenever you want, with the click of a single button.
Rather than finding and interacting with a Catch-A-Ride Station, for example, you can simply press one button and your vehicle will magically materialize before your very eyes. This makes traversal a far smoother experience and a much more intuitive one, as well.
Difficulty SettingsYou’re not always going to be in the same mood while playing Borderlands 4. Sometimes you might be eager for an epic challenge, and other times, you might be down to chill and have a more relaxing experience. With Borderlands 4, both of those different experiences are easily within your grasp.
From the main menu screen, you can access your Session Settings from the menu on the left. There, you can choose from three different difficulty settings: easy, normal, or hard. This gives you more flexibility in the way you experience the game and gives you the opportunity to play on hard from the get-go. This is a massive bonus, as you previously had to finish the game to unlock harder modes. Now you no longer have to wait to challenge yourself!
Equipped Weapon WarningYou collect a lot of different weapons and loot in Borderlands 4, so much that it’s hard to keep track of. You will constantly be in and out of your inventory, selecting things to place in storage or trash. One of the best new features about Borderlands 4 is that the game tells you if you are about to move something that you currently have equipped, so you don’t accidentally get rid of all the weapons you were using.
Moving clutter from your inventory to clear space before realizing that you just got rid of the gun you were using is extremely annoying, so this small feature can make a massive difference to your quality of life while playing. And it really does come in handy, too. I am always accidentally trying to move something I have equipped, so this feature has saved my bacon on more than one occasion.
Hologram PathIf you are anything like me, you are no good at reading a map, especially when you’re dodging shots and literally fighting for your life. In Borderlands 4, however, you can summon a hologram path that leads you straight to your next destination. This is completely optional, so you can experience all the exploration you want to by finding your next objective on your own, or make it easier on yourself by spawning the hologram path.
Sometimes you just don’t feel like wandering around in circles, looking for your destination and realizing after far too long that you’re not even on the right track. I have personally spent at least a 30 minutes wandering around the back of the location I was looking for, searching to no avail for the entrance. The hologram path is perfect in scenarios just like those and can save on unnecessary frustration.
Combat RadarThe Combat Radar is yet another one of Borderlands 4’s best additions. It’s a small, circular radar that shows you in the center and every enemy surrounding you, so you know exactly where each and every threat is in relation to you. This makes it easier than ever to assess your surroundings with a mere glance and formulate your next move.
There is a bar along the top of the screen that can also display enemy locations as small red dots, but the Combat Radar is much more in-depth and accurate, as it shows distance in addition to location. It can be activated via the HUD section of the Gameplay settings, and can also act as a compass, making exploration easier, as well.
