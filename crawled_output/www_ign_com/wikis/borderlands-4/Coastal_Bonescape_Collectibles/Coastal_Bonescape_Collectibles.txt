You can also use the pond below it as a hint of where to go, since it’s north of there. The guide is tucked underneath a cave overhang in a small lean-to.
ECHO Log Locations in Coastal BonescapeAbout the Doubt ECHO LogAbout the Doubt ECHO LogThe best way to reach this ECHO Log is to complete Coastal Bonescape’s Order Silo, since you’ll need the balloon to get to it. It’s on a cliff east of The Stockroom Order Silo, but also north of the Shammy’s Shack point of interest. This puts it near the northeast side of Coastal Bonescape.
Once you reach the little bit of land jutting out from the mountain, check the nearby lean-to for an ECHO Log resting on a crate.
A Hair-brained Scheme ECHO LogA Hair-brained Scheme ECHO LogThe ECHO Log for A Hair-brained Scheme is inside a house to the east of Sarrett’s Jetty and south of Harper’s Hideaway. This area is far west of the center of the Coastal Bonescape region. You can either cross a bridge to reach this ramshackle house on the cliff or walk over from the northern side.
A Prisoner's Promise ECHO LogA Prisoner's Promise ECHO LogThe ECHO Log for A Prisoner's Promise is near the southwest corner of the Coastal Bonescape region. It's between the Stillshore and The Headquarters of the Crimson Resistance points of interest. As long as you follow the coast, you'll come across a flipped canoe where this ECHO Log is.
A Novel Find ECHO LogA Novel Find ECHO LogThe ECHO Log for A Novel Find is a little southeast of the center of the Coastal Bonescape. It's west of Shammy's Shack and north of Riptide Grotto. You'll find it inside a Kratch nest, where a giant skull is resting against a nearby rock wall. The ECHO Log is at the bottom of the skull, on top of some Kratch nesting.
A Maker's Mark ECHO LogA Maker's Mark ECHO LogGetting the ECHO Log, A Maker's Mark, requires completing seven side missions and starting an eighth that leads you to it. Therefore, knowing the map location is helpful, but far from the whole story. With that said, it's near the eastern side of the Coastal Bonescape, southeast of the Order Silo, The Stockroom. Which puts it at the point of interest, Shammy's Shack.
If you've completed all the side missions except the final one in the table below, you'll find the ECHO Log on the counter at Shammy's Shack. Otherwise, you'll need to work through them all until you get to Ain't No Sham in It. This will lead you directly to the ECHO Log since it's an objective.

Ain't No Sham in ItDead Bolt Locations in Coastal BonescapeDead Bolt 1Coastal Bonescape Dead Bolt 1A Net of Lies ECHO LogThis Dead Bolt is at the Sandytoes Villa near the top left corner of the Coastal Bonescape. Which is also the northwest corner if you use the compass. You’ll find it on a raised hill or peninsula near the coast. It’s behind the building, on the floor, beneath a hanging net of fish. Collecting this Dead Bolt gives the ECHO Log, A Net of Lies.
Dead Bolt 2Coastal Bonescape Dead Bolt 2The Dilly-O ECHO LogThis Dead Bolt is on the island near the top center of the Coastal Bonescape, inside the Fishin’ Spot pond. It’s on the southern side, on the floor, next to a small canoe and a body. Collecting this Dead Bolt gives the ECHO Log, The Dilly-O.
Lost Capsule Location in Coastal BonescapeLost Capsule 1Lost Capsule 1This Lost Capsule is below the center of the Coastal Bonescape region. It’s relatively far south of the Fishin’ Spot point of interest, while also between The Stockroom Order Silo and Abandoned Post Safehouse. Keep an eye out for a large barn with a small restaurant beyond it up on the cliff.
The Lost Capsule is on the counter of the BBQ Kratch building, where you’ll also find the Kratchman enemy and some flying Kratches.
Propaganda Speaker Locations in Coastal BonescapePropaganda Speaker 1Coastal Bonescape Propaganda Speaker 1This Propaganda Speaker is east of the center of the Coastal Bonescape region. It’s way up above Shammy’s Shack, which is also southeast of The Stockroom Order Silo. You’ll find a bunch of Rippers and Psychos here ready to fight, even before you start hacking the speaker.
Propaganda Speaker 2Coastal Bonescape Propaganda Speaker 2This Propaganda Speaker is to the east of Plungeford, near the top center of the Coastal Bonescape region. It’s tucked near a mountain out of the way, making it easy to miss if you don’t hear it or know to look for it.
Survivalist Cache Locations in Coastal BonescapeSurvivalist Cache 1Coastal Bonescape Survivalist Cache 1This Survivalist Cache is near the northwest corner of the Coastal Bonescape region. It’s on a bridge east of the Harper’s Hideaway point of interest, crossing the river. You’ll need to jump up from below it or the outside to get into the attic of the bridge. Here you’ll find the cache ready to loot.
Survivalist Cache 2Coastal Bonescape Survivalist Cache 2This Survival Cache is near the southeast side of the Coastal Bonescape region. You can find it at the Haywire Shire point of interest, which is east of Riptide Grotto, but south of Shammy’s Shack. It’s above a building that's built into the side of a hill.
Survivalist Cache 3Coastal Bonescape Survivalist Cache 3This Survivalist Cache is at the Sarrett’s Jetty point of interest, which is all the way to the west of the Coastal Bonescape’s center. You’ll find this point of interest on the coast, a little north of where the river stops. The cache is sitting just before the water where a large sailboat is sinking.
Evocariums Locations in Coastal BonescapeEvocarium 1Coastal Bonescape Evocarium 1Lost ECHO LogThis Evocarium is near the northwest side of the Coastal Bonescape region, where the Harper’s Hideaway point of interest is. You’ll need to climb the stairs to a silo on the southern side, where you can find a useful device. This will show you where three Memordium Orbs are that you need to collect for the Evocarium.
Use the beams shooting out from this device to find each one. Once you’ve collected all three, return to the device and interact with it. This will then give you the Lost ECHO Log.
While you can grab them in any order, go for the first one above the barn, also labeled on the map as Harper’s Hideaway. When looking at it from the silo, you can find a way onto the roof from the left side or to the west using the compass.
The second one toward the north is on top of a two-story building. The best way to reach it is by leaping off the silos next to this building.
The third one is on the second level of a giant silo tower to the northwest of the device at the start. You can walk up the stairs or parkour your way to this Memordium Orb.
Evocarium 2Coastal Bonescape Evocarium 2Paradise ECHO LogThis Evocarium is far east in the Coastal Bonescape region, where the Waterstop point of interest is. You’ll find a device on the ground near the southwest side that you can interact with to find the three Memordium orbs. You can climb two nearby buildings for two of the three. However, the third can be a little more confusing to find since it’s under the floor.
To find the third orb, go northwest from the device, skipping over one pit until you reach the second one. This one will have massive pipes and machinery in it. It also has a ladder leading underneath the nearby floor where the third orb is. Returning to the device after getting all three orbs will give you the Paradise ECHO Log.
Vault Fragment Location in Coastal BonescapeStillshore Vault FragmentCoastal Bonescape Vault Fragment 1Completing the Order Silo in the Coastal Bonescape will give you a hint of where this Vault Fragment is. Otherwise, you can head to the bottom left corner of this region, which is the southwest corner. This is where the Stillshore point of interest is. You’ll find the Vault Fragment on a crate beneath the tower with a slow-spinning fan on the back of it.
Vault Symbol Locations in Coastal BonescapeVault Symbol 1Coastal Bonescape Vault Symbol 1This Vault Symbol is near the bottom right of the Coastal Bonescape region, which is the southeast corner. It’s also south of the Waterstop point of interest, putting it a little closer to the coast, but not quite there.
You’ll need to find a building near the cliffside that’s surrounded by Kratches. The Vault Symbol itself is on top of that building, near the cliffside. The symbol itself is facing the water, slightly below the highest point of the building.
Vault Symbol 2Coastal Bonescape Vault Symbol 2This Vault Symbol is one of two near Plungeford, near the top center of the Coastal Bonescape region. You can find this one inside a tall building near the waterfalls with a water wheel attached to it. The Vault Symbol is on the third floor, near the stairs, tucked away in a small room.
Vault Symbol 3Coastal Bonescape Vault Symbol 3This Vault Symbol is the second of two near Plungeford, near the top center of the Coastal Bonescape region. Once you reach the Active Checkpoint above Plungeford, you can turn to the right, facing east, and find the Vault Symbol on a rock wall. This puts it northeast of the Plungeford map marker.
Marcus Bobblehead Locations in Coastal BonescapeMarcus Bobblehead 1Coastal Bonescape Marcus Bobblehead 1This is the Sarrett’s Jetty Marcus Bobblehead, which you can find on a sunken boat off the coast. If you’re not sure where this point of interest is, it’s all the way west of the center of the Coastal Bonescape.
To find this bobblehead, you’ll need to swim northwest of Sarret’s Jetty. Before you do, look from the brown sailboat out to see a gray steel frame off to the right, not the left. It’s part of another boat that must have wrecked. You’ll find the bobblehead resting on the tip highest out of the water.
Marcus Bobblehead 2Coastal Bonescape Marcus Bobblehead 2This Marcus Bobblehead is slightly southeast of Stillshore and a little west of the Active Checkpoint near there. It’s on top of a rock pillar, clearly visible from the Active Checkpoint while facing west. This rock pillar has some brown metal tubes running along it as well. You can either try climbing it using the metal tubes or float over from the hill to the north of this pillar.
Marcus Bobblehead 3Coastal Bonescape Marcus Bobblehead 3This Marcus Bobblehead is south of the Pool of Re-Flex-tion, which is northwest of the Abandoned Post Safehouse. This area is near the southwest side of the Coastal Bonescape region. If you go west from the Abandoned Post and follow the southern edge of the cliff, you’ll come across a small cave with a rock overhang.
Continue to follow the cliff edge and you’ll see the Marcus Bobblehead shortly. It’s in line with an island to the south that’s raised by two rock pillars.
Marcus Bobblehead 4Coastal Bonescape Marcus Bobblehead 4This Marcus Bobblehead is north of Harper’s Hideway, which is near the top left of the Coastal Bonescape region. Since this is a tough spot to explain, I recommend going north of Harper’s Hideaway, then west until you reach the cliff edge. If you look out toward the water from this cliff, you’ll see a massive purple crystal shard.
Now turn back around and work your way up the hill to the east, following the wall. Once you climb from the large patch of grass to a rocky floor, you’re close to the bobblehead. If you follow the wall for three seconds while walking at most, you’ll start to hear the sounds hinting that you’re nearby.
