Here's everything you need to know about completing the quest and unlocking your unique SHiFT Code reward in Borderlands 4.
How to Unlock Your Unique Borderlands 4 Discord Quest SHiFT Code (September 2025):1. Log in to Discord and Click on Discover > Quests. In here, you'll find the "Borderlands 4 Looter Quest." Click on "Accept Quest."
2. Click on the "Select a platform to get started" drop-down menu and select either "Quest on Desktop" or "Quest on Console," depending on which platform you're playing Borderlands 4 on.
3. If you're playing on PC, Discord should automatically detect you playing. But if you're on console, you'll need to select "Connect Console." A pop-up menu will appear, prompting you to select either PlayStation or Xbox. Do so, and follow the on-screen instructions to connect your account to Discord.
4. Once connected, launch Borderlands 4 on your PC or console and play for 15 minutes (you can leave it idle on the main menu if you'd like). You should see your progress increase around the quest icon - this is how you know it's working.
5. After you've played Borderlands 4 for 15 minutes, click on "Claim Reward" under the Borderlands 4 Looter Discord quest. A pop-up will appear with your unique SHiFT Code, which you can then redeem on the SHiFT website or in-game for 1 Golden Key.
