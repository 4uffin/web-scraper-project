While Kairos is made up of many different regions, there are three major zones, each with a vault to find. Before you can open it, you'll need to track down three Vault Key Fragments to access one. The three zones are The Fadefields, Terminus Range, and Carcadia Burn. This page will help you find each Vault Key Fragment collectible.
Did you know that completing an Order Silo will help you find the Vault Key Fragment for your region if there's one there? It creates a large circle around the area where it can be, and then a scanner shows how close you are to it. But who needs that when you have us to help you!

Otherwise, you can head to the bottom left corner of this region, which is the southwest corner. This is where the Stillshore point of interest is. You’ll find the Vault Fragment on a crate beneath the tower with a slow-spinning fan on the back of it.
The Howl Vault Key FragmentThe Howl Vault Fragment 1The Howl Vault Fragment is tucked into a cave overhang north-northeast of The Launchpad, but southwest of Ardor's Bounty. It’s easiest to enter from the north side. You'll also notice the massive cave entrance much more easily from this side. While the Manglers nearby shouldn't be too much of a problem, they're another clue that you're close.
Idolator's Noose Vault Key FragmentIdolator’s Noose Vault Fragment 1This Vault Fragment is slightly northeast of the center of Idolator’s Noose, inside the Rosemary’s Reserve point of interest. If you see the Propaganda Tower, go a little bit to the southeast, where there’s a vent you can pull, revealing an opening in a wall.
This leads to a small area with loot and the Vault Fragment inside. You'll find it in the south corner below some red lighting.
Terminus Range Vault Key FragmentsCuspid Climb Vault Key FragmentCuspid Climb Vault Fragment 1The Cuspid Climb Vault Fragment is near the center of the Cuspid Climb region. However, you'll want to unlock the Order Silo here first, The Reliquary. This is because you'll need the balloon to fly over to where the Vault Fragment is.
Once you have the balloon, head over to it and before you fly up, look to the north. You'll see a large rock bridge jutting out from the mountain near a waterfall. We need to land over there where a cave is. After landing, make your way inside the cave to the northeast. You may run into a unique Mangler or even a dynamic Rift depending on your luck.
After heading inside through the cave crevice, climb up to the top where two bodies are. You'll find the Vault Key Fragment laying next to a woman on the floor.
The Low Leys Vault Key FragmentThe Low Leys Vault Fragment 1The Low Leys Vault Fragment is near the center of the region by The Pit point of interest. This is also east of the Snowy Wells Safehouse from the Stoneblood Forest region. When following the road north toward The Pit, you’ll need to stop at a large dead tree with a smaller tree below it that has purple petals.
Looking northeast from these trees reveals a bunch of rocks you’ll need to climb up. The first batch of rocks leads to a platform where you’ll have access to a grapple node. It’s a little more to the east this time, farther up the mountain. This will bring you right to the Vault Fragment.
Windspear Vault Key FragmentWindspear Vault Fragment 1The Windspear Vault Fragment is south of the center of the region, right on the border between Windspear and The Low Leys. It's easy to mistake it as being part of The Low Leys because the ECHO Log here is part of that region for some reason. Regardless, for more direction, it's also northwest of the Checkpoint Taupe point of interest and southeast of The Vestal Garrison.
You'll need to enter through the southern side of The Vestal Garrison, inside The Low Leys. Before following the road into Windspear, make a left facing west, where an entrance is to this Order base.
You’ll run into a bunch of Order enemies here outside the door we have to go through. After entering, turn to your right, facing east, and continue until you reach the first door there. Make your way northeast into this room to the far section with computers. You'll find the Vault Fragment resting on a crate below one of the large monitors.
Carcadia Burn Vault Key FragmentsLopside Vault Key FragmentLopside Vault Fragment 1The Lopside Vault Fragment is a little northwest of the center of the region. It's south of the Makeshift Chalet Safehouse, but also north of the point of interest, The Yawning Yard. Following the road, you'll come across a rundown gas station with a sign that says, One Pumper. Don't be surprised if you run into some Ripper enemies around here.
While standing on the road and looking west toward the gas station, you should see a grappling node to hook onto. It'll bring you up to the second story open floor, where the Vault Fragment is. It's resting on top of a long dining table. And beyond this is also a Dead Bolt you can grab too.
Tonnage Peel Vault Key FragmentTonnage Peel Vault Fragment 1The Tonnage Peel Vault Fragment is sort of west of the center of the region. It's part of the point of interest, Wreck of the Last Great Hope. Which is a decent distance west of the Safehouse, The Lowrise. Fortunately, the general area where this Vault Fragment is, is very noticeable because it's inside a giant ship wreck.
The confusing part is that the path to finding it is nowhere near the map marker itself. Instead, you'll need to get underneath the southeast portion of the shipwreck. Which has a few entrances, but we'll recommend the south one.
If you're driving along the road north to south, passing by the shipwreck, once you reach the end of the part closest to the road, make a right. You'll be near a batch of dead trees. If you follow the shipwreck wall facing southwest, you'll come across the entrance we're looking for.
Continue through the entrance all the way northwest to the end until you reach a blinking red light. Below this light is a vent cover on the floor. Use your grappling hook to pull it loose. And then drop down below, where you'll find the Vault Fragment up a short path.
Ruined Sumplands Vault Key FragmentRuined Sumplands Vault Fragment 1The Ruined Sumplands Vault Fragment is near the northwest portion of the region. You'll find it just before the bridge leading to the northernmost point of the Ruined Sumplands. This Vault Fragment is also slightly northeast of the Hull's Handbasket point of interest.
A good way to find it is to go left of the northern bridge or southwest from the beginning of it. You'll end up going down a hill, leading down to where the water is. Once you reach the water, look to your right, facing east, and you'll see the Vault Fragment if a pillar isn't in the way. As usual, the gold spheres nearby are a good clue of where to look.
