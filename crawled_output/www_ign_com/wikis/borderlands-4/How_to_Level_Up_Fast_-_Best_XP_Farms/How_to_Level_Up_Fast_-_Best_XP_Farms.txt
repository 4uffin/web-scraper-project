You won't have much hope of completing the story at level one, of course! Thankfully, you don't have to worry about that. Gaining XP and leveling up is something that occurs naturally as you play, but there are ways to make the process go a little faster so you can progress more comfortably.
Explore Areas With High Enemy Density Play Co-Op With High Level Players Complete Main Story Missions Complete As Many Side Quests As Possible Replay Bosses Complete Vile Bounties
Rift EventsExplore Areas With High Enemy DensityNot only is exploring Kairos an excellent way to know your surroundings, but it is also a great way to get XP. With each new area unlocked comes more XP and opportunities to defeat enemies, as well. And you know what that means! That's right, even more XP.
Some areas are destined to bag you more XP than others, however. Every single enemy you defeat earns you experience that helps you to level up, so locating the settlements and areas with the most bad guys gives you more opportunities to excel. Seek out those spots with a higher density of enemies to gain the most XP quickly.
Many small towns and settlements around Kairos are swarming with animals or bandits. When you find a location that's overrun, take down the threats and clear the location out. Simply doing that will get a lot of XP under your belt.
The enemies that are closest to your current level will earn you the most XP fast. Weaker enemies earn you less XP, and enemies that are much stronger than you take too long to kill.Instead of rushing through the story, take the time to explore each new region in the game. And when you come across places littered with enemies, wipe them all out! Doing that will uncover the whole map, allow you to locate collectibles and weapons, and, of course, help you to level up much faster than you would otherwise.
Ripper Drill Sites and Order Bunkers, and Vault Dungeons are perfect high-density enemy zones to clear out for tons of XP and loot! Play Co-Op With High-Level PlayersPlaying co-op with players who are a higher level than you is another hack to level up quickly. Higher-level players can take down enemies much stronger than you, which helps you gain more XP than you would by playing on your own against enemies that are a similar level to you.
While in a party, if one person defeats an enemy, XP is gained by all party members present at the time of the kill. While XP is shared, it appears that the individual who makes the kill may receive marginally more XP than the others, however. So, allowing your high-level friends to wear down enemies so you can make the killing blow is another way to earn tons of XP quickly.
Complete Main Story MissionsOut of all the ways to collect XP in Borderlands 4, completing main quests is one of the most lucrative. Main objectives bag you more XP than side quests, exploration, and enemy hunting. So while those other tactics are great ways to level up quickly, don't sleep on the main story!
Completing the main objectives and progressing with the story also unlocks new areas and places for you to explore, which only gives you even more opportunities to farm XP. So while story missions might take a little longer to complete than a side quest, for example, they are well worth it for their perks.
Complete As Many Side Quests As PossibleSide Mission Locations - Interactive MapMain missions are the best quests to complete if you want the most XP out of a single task, but completing all the side quests you come across is essential if you want to level up as quickly as possible. If you're following our first tip and exploring every region you explore, you will gather these side quests very quickly.
You can tell side quests apart from the main quests by their quest icons. Main quest icons are yellow, while the side quest icons are smaller, blue diamonds!Tick these off your do-to list as you collect them and your level will soar. A single side quest doesn't offer as much XP as a main one, but they can be completed faster, allowing you to bust them out and rack up that XP much quicker than simply exploring the lands of Kairos!
Replay BossesOne of the best new features in Borderlands 4 is the ability to reset bosses. This allows you to farm them endlessly and gain incredible amounts of HP and loot quickly and easily. This new feature is introduced via Moxxi's Big Encore Machine, accessible after completing the main story.
Bosses like the Timekeeper, Vile Lictor, Ripper Queen Callis, and Idolator Sol are great to use to farm XP.All Moxxi's Big Encore and Boss Locations - Borderlands 4 Interactive MapThe Encore Machine is available in the Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode hub and makes grinding in the post-game far less frustrating and essentially stress-free. Replaying bosses does cost Eridium, but that’s a small price to pay for such an epic mechanic! You can also find weekly challenges there to further test your Borderlands 4 mettle.
Complete Vile BountiesAll Bounty Board Locations - Interactive MapVile bounties (or any bounty in general) are excellent ways to gain a lot of XP fast. Bounties involve locating and eliminating specific targets, which can be very easy, provided you have the right weapons and the element of surprise on your side.
Bounties can be collected and completed very quickly if you have the above on your side, which means you can earn tons of XP very quickly for very minimal effort. Some bounties may give you more of a run for your money, but still, they are usually well worth the effort.
Vile bounties, in particular, earn you far better rewards, such as Legendary-tier weapons and items, as well as XP. Vile enemies are ones that have been compromised and have large crystals growing out of their bodies, so they are easy to spot in a crowd.
You can pick up bounties from Safehouses, so make sure you always have some on your to-do list so you can keep gathering that quick XP.Rift EventsAll Known Rift and World Event Spawn Locations - Interactive MapRift Events are dynamic world events that spawn throughout Kairos in Borderlands 4. They are large, dome-like structures that, when entered, offer high-intensity, fast-paced combat encounters. You will go up against hordes of enemies during Rift Events, including bosses as well as regular enemies.
These events are not for the faint of heart. It can get brutal in there, but the rewards, XP, and loot that you can collect there is well worth the effort, especially if you have a couple of teammates on your side!
These events are part of Borderlands 4's reactive world system. That means they are not quite as random as they seem! Things like story progression, leveling up, and generally progressing through your adventure can trigger these sorts of events to start. Dying will also trigger World Events to shift and spawn.
