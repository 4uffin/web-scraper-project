Thankfully, we’re here to help, as our team at IGN has compiled a list of helpful tips and tricks that can improve and enhance your early game experience in Borderland 4.
If you’re chasing more in-depth tips and tricks, such as unlocking $1 Legendaries or upgrading your inventory and ammo capacity, be sure to check out our guides on 9 Things to Do First in Borderlands 4 and 13 Things Borderlands 4 Doesn’t Tell You for more details.Essential Tips and Tricks You Need to KnowUnderstand Enemy Elemental WeaknessesBefore you progress too far into Borderlands 4, it’s important that you understand the colors of the different enemy health bars, as each has an elemental weakness.
Red health bars for standard flesh and bones type enemies are weak to fire damage; green health bars for mechanical-type enemies are weak to corrosion damage; and blue health bars for enemy shields are weak to shock-type weapons.
Just be aware, though, that some enemies are known to have their elemental affinities change. We uncovered this while replaying missions, as some bosses had different elemental affinities from our initial playthrough.
Always Have a Contract ActiveAs soon as you gain access to Contract Boards, which are found at all Safe Houses and Faction Towns, we highly recommend having at least four or five Contracts active at all times throughout your playthrough. While seemingly simple tasks, these Contracts can be immensely helpful in your progression as not only do they offer cash and weapon rewards, but they also provide hefty chunks of XP—at level 18, we were receiving over 4,000XP per Contract.
Most Contracts, especially Collect and Patrol Contracts, can be completed in a mere few minutes or even left to passively complete over time as you explore the world and complete missions.

Check out our Side Missions hub for a list of all quests you can find in Borderlands 4, as well as their rewards and locations.Keep an Eye Out for World EventsWhen exploring the open world, keep an eye out for bubble domes that randomly form over certain locations. These mark the location of a world boss, and once you enter the bubble, the boss will spawn and you'll be engaged in a fight with a very tough enemy.
You only get one shot to beat these bosses: If you die, or if you leave the bubble, the boss will despawn, and you'll have to wait for another bubble to appear somewhere else in the world. These bosses drop great loot once you kill them and are one of the best sources of early to mid-game gear.
Always Keep At Least One Enemy Low HealthWhen taking on large groups of enemies, try to keep at least one weak one alive at all times. That way, there will be easy prey for you to get a Second Wind if you fall. This can be incredibly useful when exploring the open world, as some respawn points can often be quite a distance away!
Keep Your Inventory Organized With Category TagsFound a weapon or other item that you don't necessarily need? Don't leave it behind, as it can be assigned as Junk, and later offloaded at vending machines for some quick and easy cash, as you’ll come across thousands of unwanted and valuable weapons throughout your playthrough that would otherwise be tossed aside and forgotten.
You can manage your Junk by visiting the Inventory menu, selecting Backpack, and then filtering items via the “Junk” category, which will display all the items you have marked as Junk—junk items will appear with a small red trash can on their icon. If you happened to accidentally mark an item as Junk, you can untoggle it by simply selecting the item and pressing R3/X.
Replay Bosses For RewardsYou can replay any boss you've defeated already by returning to the boss arena and paying a fee for Moxxi's Big Encore. Doing so will respawn the boss, allowing you to challenge them again and get new rewards, albeit fewer than the first time you beat them.
Legendary Weapons and Items are primarily dropped by defeating bosses. To view a list of what's available, see our Legendary Weapons and Items List for all weapon drop locations and special effects.Don’t Leave Your Rewards UnclaimedMission and challenge rewards are not instantly rewarded upon completing missions. Instead, to receive your rewards, you must navigate to the Inventory menu and visit the Rewards Center. Here, you’ll find a full list of all unclaimed rewards.
Other Quick Tips and Tricks Friendly NPCs like Zadra and even Claptrap can revive you when you go down in combat. So, when you’re fighting alongside friendly NPCs, we recommend staying close by, as this allows them the opportunity to quickly revive you, should you go down and don’t have an enemy to defeat during Second Wind. When exploring the open world or completing main missions, be sure to listen closely for sparkling-like sounds, as this indicates that a collectible can be found nearby. If you have accidentally sold an item you wanted to keep, you can repurchase it via the "Buyback" tab when interacting with a Vending Machine. Transporting a Lost Capsule can force you to walk a long distance on foot, but you can also toss it and catch up with a Digirunner. Character unlocks, such as additional weapon slots, Enhancements, and Class Mods, are locked behind level progression—reaching level 20 should unlock access to every item slot available in Borderlands 4.Looking for even more Borderlands 4 Guides?
