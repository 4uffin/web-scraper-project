But just because you will mostly be using it in the end-game, doesn't mean you won't be actively farming it during the campaign. There are several ways to get your hands on this rare resource, each of which we will be covering in this Borderlands 4 guide. And if you're not sure whether you should be putting the effort into collecting Eridium because you don't know what it's for, you can find information on that here, as well.
How to Farm Eridium How to Use EridiumHow to Farm EridiumThere are multiple methods you can use to farm Eridium, so you always have enough on hand for whatever you might need it for. Spending your hard-earned Eridium is essential for engaging with several end-game mechanics, so make sure you keep an eye out for the following events so you can start filling up your Eridium wallet:
ContractsContracts are small missions that you can accept at Safehouses and complete for bonuses such as XP, loot, and, of course, Eridium. These missions are entirely optional, meaning you don't have to complete any of them to continue progressing with the story, but they are definitely worth doing if you are on the grind for Eridium or even just XP.
You unlock the ability to complete contracts as soon as you unlock your first Safehouse, which happens very early on in your adventure. Since some of those end-game mechanics have hefty Eridium price tags, there is no harm in completing things like contracts to get a head start and beef up your stash.
Completing contracts is also one of the best ways to farm XP and level up fast!ChallengesChallenges can be found by checking out your Missions and scrolling to the next tab over. There, you can find a wide variety of challenges that you can complete for loot, XP, and more. There are seemingly endless amounts of challenges to complete here,
making it a brilliant way to earn Eridium to help you out in the end-game, as well as XP and loot to help you out in the current stages of your adventure. Check back into the challenges tab regularly to see what's available and give yourself something to do in your Borderlands 4 downtime!
Campaign ProgressionArguably, the easiest way to earn more Eridium is simply to play Borderlands 4 and progress with the story.
Many main missions and even side quests offer Eridium as a reward, so you have probably already earned some even if you didn't notice it.
Main missions frequently offer more Eridium than side quests do, but side quests are usually much faster to successfully complete. If you feel like you're blasting through the story too fast and want to enjoy more of the game than just the campaign, take a break and complete some side quests to switch things up a bit.
Replayable MissionsIf you head into the Missions tab and scroll all the way to the end, you can find replayable ones. These missions can be replayed to earn XP, loot, cash, and even Eridium. The missions you can replay here are story ones, so they will take a little longer to complete than contracts or challenges, but if you want to maximise the amount of Eridium you are earning, they are another great option.
How to Use EridiumCreating a massive stockpile of Eridium is all well and good, but what are you collecting it for? Seeing the light at the end of the tunnel and knowing what there is to look forward to during your Eridium grind is important for preventing burnout, so let's go over what you can actually do with the resource.
You can use your Eridium for the following things:
Replaying boss fights with Moxxi's Big Encore Machine - This is a post-game machine that allows you to replay boss fights for epic legendaries and loot. Respeccing your Specialization - for 5000 Eridium, you can reset your build and reallocate Specialization points.
Firmware Transfers: You can spend Eridium to donate weapon effects to other weapons of your choice. The donor weapon is destroyed after, so make sure you choose wisely!Looking for more Borderlands 4 tips? Check out our other guides!
