What Are SHiFT Codes?SHiFT codes in Borderlands 4 are unique, one-time-use codes that can be redeemed for Golden Keys, which are then used to open the Golden Chest that’s found in-game at major Faction Towns such as The Launchpad, Carcadia, Belton’s Bore, and The Lockaway.
Opening the Golden Chest will reward you with the chance to obtain rare loot, such as Legendary Weapons and Gear, as well as cosmetic skins.
Some SHiFT codes are for cosmetics rather than just golden keys.

How to Redeem SHiFT CodesBefore you can begin to redeem SHiFT codes in Borderlands 4, you must first ensure you have signed up for SHiFT and have created a free SHiFT Account. Once you have created a free account and linked your gaming platform via the account settings, you can begin redeeming SHiFT codes in one of two ways.
The first method of redeeming SHiFT codes involves using the “Rewards” tab that’s found under your SHiFT account settings. Here, you’ll have the option to enter a SHiFT code and view all your currently redeemed codes.
The second option is to open the Pause Menu while in-game, select SHiFT, and then Rewards. Here, you can enter SHiFT codes directly into the game and redeem them.
If you successfully redeemed a SHiFT code but haven't received it in-game, there may be a server delay. It should appear after some time!Other SHiFT Codes and Rewards You can unlock and receive the "Hazard Pay" Weapon Skin by signing up to receive newsletters and digital marketing from Gearbox. To do so, simply open your SHiFT profile and scroll down to User Preferences. Here, you’ll want to tick both “I would like to receive news and promotional messages from 2K and its affiliates” and “I wish to stay subscribed to the Gearbox newsletter,” and you’ll automatically receive the weapon skin when playing the game. If you purchase the Borderlands 4 ECHO-4 Bundle from GameStop, you'll receive a unique SHiFT Code that unlocks 5 Golden Keys. This expires on December 31, 2030.Looking for even more Borderlands 4 Guides?
