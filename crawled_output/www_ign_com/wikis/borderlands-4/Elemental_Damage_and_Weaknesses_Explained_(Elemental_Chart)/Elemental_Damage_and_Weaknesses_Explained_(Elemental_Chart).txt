There are five types of elemental damage, and each has its own strengths and weaknesses. Knowing your elemental damage types and how they work is crucial to success and is a huge part of combat in Borderlands 4, so wrapping your head around it is essential.
Here, we will go over everything you need to know about the elemental chart, so you know how to combat each and every enemy type in Borderlands 4.
How Elemental Damage Works In Borderlands 4 How Elemental Weaknesses Work in Borderlands 4 How Elemental Resistances Work in Borderlands 4How Elemental Damage Works in Borderlands 4Weapons can deal more than just physical damage in Borderlands 4. They can also deal one of five different types of elemental damage. The type of damage you want to deal to a certain enemy will depend on what color their health bar is and whether or not they have a shield equipped or not (more on that in the section below).
The five types of elemental damage are as follows:
Incendiary Cryo Shock Corrosive RadiationTo find out what kind of damage a certain weapon deals, check the info in your inventory. You can either find the information listed in the weapon's description or spot the icons off to the side of the weapon while it's in your weapon wheel.
The description is where you will also find the weapon's DoT stats. DoT stands for Damage Over Time, which allows your attack to deal passive damage to your opponent. The percentage next to your elemental damage information shows the chance you have of dealing passive DoT. The DMG/s indicates how much DoT will be inflicted if it is effective.
Not all weapons deal elemental damage. If you're specifically looking for ones that do, seek out some Maliwan weapons. Those are the most common ones to deal elemental damage to your enemies, so you can take advantage of their weaknesses in combat.
It's a great rule of thumb to have one weapon of each element in your weapon wheel at all times!In addition to weapons, you can also deal elemental damage via items in the world and skills. Each Vault Hunter has their own set of skills that they can learn and use in battle, and many of these harness the power of one of the five elements. Not every Vault Hunter can learn every type of elemental damage, except for Vex. She is the only one who can harness every elemental damage type.

How Elemental Weaknesses Work in Borderlands 4Each enemy in Borderlands 4 has an elemental weakness, which is based on what their health bar tells you. There are three colors of health bar, each of which relates to one of the three enemy types. Each type is weak to something and strong against something else, so choosing wisely based upon your enemy's health bar is one of the most valuable things you can learn in Borderlands 4.
The three different enemy types and their associated colors are as follows: Flesh - Red. Armor - Yellow. Shield - Blue.Most of these types are quite intuitive, so you will learn to tell them apart even before you check their health bar. Flesh-type enemies are usually animals or beasts without any armor, armor-type enemies are usually robots, and shields can be donned by anything capable of creating and using defensive garments. Each enemy type is weak to something in Borderlands 4. It is your job to discover each enemy's weakness and use it against them to have the most success in combat.
Check the table below to see exactly what each type is weak and/or strong against. Borderlands 4 - Elemental Skills

How Elemental Resistances Work in Borderlands 4You can deal elemental damage to your enemies, and they can inflict it right back at you if they have the right weapons. Thankfully, you can combat this by taking advantage of certain elemental resistances offered by the different shields available in the game.
Some, but not all, shields offer elemental resistances. You can check what your shield's elemental resistances are by checking the item description. If your shield offers an elemental resistance, it will be shown via a colored bar just above the description. The elemental resistances for shields follow the same laws as the weapons and enemy types.
