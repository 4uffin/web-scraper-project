But, unless you know where to look, though, or are familiar with the references, these easter eggs and secrets can quickly slip by unnoticed.
Thankfully, we’re here to help, and have compiled a list of all known easter eggs and secrets we have stumbled upon so far. These include references to Pokémon, Halo, Men in Black, and even a secret way to spawn a cheap and quick Legendary Weapon.
Every Secret, Easter Egg, and Reference We’ve FoundTannis Fish Easter EggAt the northwestern most point in the Coastal Bonescape, you'll find a wooden structure near the water's edge that's surrounded by five elemental barrels nearby.
To activate the easter egg, you must first shoot the barrels in a specific order, which is:
Corrosive (Green) Cryogenic (Light Blue) Incendiary (Red) Shock (Blue) Radiation (Yellow)Once you've shot and exploded all five barrels in the order above, look out to the water, and watch as the Tannis Fish Easter Egg begins.
What Are You Doing in My Swamp?Located in the southeastern corner of Idolator's Noose in The Fadefields, you'll come across Mirehome, a small swamp town that has a rather mysterious creature calling it home.
Near the town, you'll find a large willow tree growing over a cliff filled with caves. At the base of this tree, you'll find a small passageway with plenty of warning signs surrounding it, telling you less than politely to go away.
Despite the signs, continue forward along the path until you enter another small area, where you'll encounter a rather familiar face.
As you enter the swamp, you'll need to defeat a large, green orge-like NPC that goes by the name of Shre... erm, we mean Wreck, and it looks like he's not too happy that you're in his swamp.
If we're not mistaken, this is none other than a reference to the classic DreamWorks Animation film, Shrek.
If the warning signs and Wreck's appearance weren't already enough of a giveaway, you'll also be greeted by his trusty companion, Burro, which is Spanish for Donkey.
Test Your Skills On the Football FieldAt the Launchpad in Kairos, you'll find a soccer field, which features a ball in the center of the pitch. While you can shoot the ball with your weapons to get it to roll into the goals, you can also approach it carefully and press the interact button to kick it—the ball will continually respawn after it has moved from the center of the field, so you’ll be free to continue playing, even after the ball explodes.
Give Moxxi a Big Ol’ Tip for a Legendary WeaponYou can earn a quick and easy guaranteed Legendary Weapon by giving A Big Ol' $1,000 Tip to the tip jar in Moxxi's Bottoms Up! bar, which you'll visit during the main story when traveling to Carcadia Burn.
Now, there is no set amount that you need to tip, as the chance of receiving a Legendary Weapon is entirely random.
After some testing, we received our first legendary after tipping just over $20,000, a second after tipping an additional $43,000, and then two more within just $5,000. Once Moxxi is pleased with the amount you've tipped, hearts will float over the tip jar, and Moxxi, who wanders around the bar, will stop and hold out a Legendary Weapon.
Additionally, the legendary weapons rewarded by tipping Moxxi's tip jar all feature sexual references and innuendos in their flavor-filled descriptions.
Legendary Vending MachineAfter completing the Siege and Destroy main mission in Carcadia City, you’ll unlock the Vend of the Line side mission, which has you traveling across the region as you seek out the fabled Legendary Vending Machine. The vending machine is said to sell only the most unique and Legendary Weapons.
And, as it turns out, it’s true, as the Legendary Vending Machine will, in fact, sell Legendary Weapons, but there’s a catch. After a series of events take place—we’ll save you the spoilers—you’ll be given the opportunity to purchase a single Legendary Weapon from this machine for the very low price of $1.00.
Given that this quest is unlocked relatively mid-way through the story, we highly recommend completing this quest as soon as possible, as it could end up providing one of the first Legendary Weapons you properly own.
We Have Pokémon At HomeHidden away in the Cuspid Climb region, you’ll discover the Wayward Gun side quest, which has you helping the Lavandula Camp bring order back to the AI-enhanced Tediore firearms, which have since turned rogue and are now roaming about the area. This entire questline feels like a genuine Pokémon-style story and is a clear reference to the popular franchise.
During the quest, you’ll be tasked with using special Catch-tainers—which function similarly to Poke Balls—to trap Tediore Offspring.
As you progress through the quest, you’ll even receive a visit from a knockoff Team Rocket, who will, of course, try to stop you.
American Pyscho ReferenceAfter killing the Big Orange Hothead enemy at The Flarewell order base during the ’No Place Like Home' side mission, look to the ground as he’ll drop a Facility Keycard item with the description "Oh my god, it even has a watermark...". This is a reference to the popular cult classic film American Psycho, starring Christian Bale.
Halo ReferenceWhen fighting Splashzone through Moxxi's Big Encore, you'll have a chance to receive the Lead Balloon Legendary Weapon, which happens to reference the iconic Halo 2 quote, “For a brick, he flew pretty good," in its flavor-text.
Oops... Someone’s in TroubleWhen carefully viewing the scrolling green text seen on many computers throughout Borderlands 4, you'll notice that the text isn't actually code. In fact, it's a totally random conversation that someone is having with themselves, as they share that they don't actually know how to code and are clearly making themselves look busy. Oops!
Plinko Makes Its Way to KairosDuring the PowerDrop side mission, you’ll be tasked with visiting the bunker below The Launchpad, where you'll participate in a Plinko-inspired gambling game. Should you drop into the top prize slot, you'll earn yourself access to a container filled with weapons—from our experience, the weapons were quite lackluster, but you may end up snagging something that you like.
Scooter Makes a Return… KindaThe Catch-A-Ride achievement, which requires collecting all personal vehicles, features a skull that closely resembles Scooter, who was a fan-favorite character from previous installments of the series, and even references his popular catch phrase.
The Noisy CricketThe Noisy Cricket pistol from Men in Black makes an appearance in Borderlands 4. While the gun may not perform all that well, it does happen to share the same name, a similar effect, and the famous quote “Feel like I’m gonna break this damn thing!” in its description.
Find the Marcus BobbleheadsMarcus, the weapons dealer from the Sanctuary in Borderlands 2, has been commemorated in Borderlands 4 with his very own “Marcus Bobbleheads,” which have been scattered all across Kairos to uncover. With 200 Marcus Bobbleheads to be found, each bobblehead has been strategically hidden in areas that often aren’t trafficked much, making them tricky to find, especially since they aren’t tracked as a collectible.
As for a reward, each Bobblehead can be flicked for 100XP. As time passes, the Bobbleheads will reset, and you’ll be free to flick them once again for a further 100XP.
Marcus Bobblehead Locations - Interactive MapAt launch, we are currently not sure if flicking all 200 Marcus Bobbleheads will earn you an award, or if they simply just grant XP—we’ll keep you posted!
Ghostbusters!The Legendary Submachine Gun, Ohm I Got, references a famous 1984 Ghostbusters movie quote, “Back off, man. I’m a scientist,” in its flavor text.
Michelle Visage ReferenceWhen following Leggies during the To the Limb It: Redux side mission near Rosemary's Reserve, you'll likely run into a Mangler den that includes a unique one named Vichelle Mirage, a nod to TV personality and former pop star Michelle Visage.Up Next: Biggest Changes You Need to KnowPreviousStorage Deck Upgrade ListNextBiggest Changes You Need to KnowTop Guide SectionsThings to Do First in Borderlands 4WalkthroughBorderlands 4 SHiFT CodesWhich Character Should You Choose in Borderlands 4Was this guide helpful?Leave feedbackIn This GuideBorderlands 4GearboxSep 12, 2025Learn moreGo to commentsReviews•Editor Columns•News•Guides•Upcoming Sales Events•How to Watch Guides•Board Game Reviews•GTA 5 Cheats•Best Streaming Bundles•IGN Store•Top Deals•Contact Us•IGN YouTube•HowLongToBeat•IGN TikTok•IGN Twitter•Map Genie•Eurogamer•Rock Paper Shotgun•VG247•Maxroll•Privacy Policy•Terms of Use
