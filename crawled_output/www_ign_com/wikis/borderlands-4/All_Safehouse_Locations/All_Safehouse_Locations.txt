How to Unlock and Claim Safehouses All Safehouse LocationsHow to Unlock and Claim SafehousesIn order to unlock the non-story required Safehouses, you’ll need to find a hidden Datapad, which then ECHO-4 will scan, and that will allow you to stand in front of the console and claim the Safehouse.
Near many of these Safehouses, you’ll encounter powerful enemies that will try to stop you from finding the Datapad. It’s not mandatory to clear the enemies before finding the datapad or even claiming the Safehouse’s console, but it’s very possible you could die while you’re frantically searching around for the Datapad. But that’s where we come in to show you the location of the datapad!
You can activate ECHO-4's scanning abilities, and if you're near the datapad, it'll show up on your compass/radar. It'll be shown as a blue diamond icon. It's always helpful to set your pin to the Safehouse so that you can follow the waypoint directly to where you need to be
It’s also encouraged to try and claim the Safehouse first while you’re being shot at, as successfully claiming it will immediately summon NPCs to the area, and they’ll help you clear the enemies.
All Safehouse LocationsAll Safehouse Locations MapBelow is a complete list of all 14 Safehouse locations in Borderlands 4, split up by region.
Fadefields Safehouses
Terminus Range Safehouses
Carcadia Burn Safehouses
Dominion SafehousesFadefieldsAbandoned PostLocated in the Fadefields, in the southwest at the Coastal Bonescape area, this is the first one you’ll come across, and you’ll be required to unlock it as part of the story at the very beginning when you meet up with Claptrap.
Abandoned Post SafehouseShut-Eye KeepThis one is in The Howl area, also southwest, go up north and you'll find Shut Eye Keep. Go up the elevator and into the building. You’ll come across an open area with enemies. After dealing with them, you’ll come across another room with more enemies. This is where both the console and the datapad are located.
There are two grappling hook nodes on both sides of the room, but the datapad is on the left side. So grapple on to that and walk into the hall, and you’ll find the datapad. Go back down to the middle of the room and the console to claim Shut Eye Keep is there.
Shut-Eye SafehouseWyclef’s ReprieveWyclef's Reprieve is located in Idolator’s Noose, an area found in southeastern Fadefields. When first arriving at Wyclef’s Reprieve, you'll notice that it's surrounded by several aerial monsters. Carefully take them down while dodging their attacks until you have managed to clear the area.
Once cleared, it's now time to find the Datapad, which is actually found on a small ledge, beneath the building. So, in order to obtain Wyclef's Reprieve Datapad, head to the back of the main building, and you'll find that part of the balcony railing has been destroyed.
Jump off the balcony through the gap in the railing, and then glide down directly below until you spot a giant purple crystal protruding from the ground.
Here, you'll find Myclef's Reprieve Datapad on top of a white crate next to the crystal.
Upon collecting the Datapad, return to the Safehouse and interact with the console found in the middle of the control room.
Wyclef’s Reprieve SafehouseSomeday RiseAlso in Idolator’s Noose, you’ll find the Someday Rise Safehouse. Looking in the direction of the Safehouse, the datapad is to the right on a bed outside. The door to the Safehouse will be unlocked, and you’ll be able to claim the console inside.
Someday Rise SafehouseTerminus RangeGrey HavenageIn the eastern region of Kairos called Terminus Range, in Cuspid Climb, you’ll come across the Grey Havenage Safehouse. To find the datapad, climb the construction vehicle out in front, onto the shovel at the end, then grab onto the climbing rig to pull yourself up to the platform. You’ll see the datapad there.
Grey Havenage SafehouseHeritage OpusAlso in Cuspid Climb, you’ll find the Heritage Opus Safehouse. To get there, set a pin on the location in your map, and follow the waypoint. It’ll lead you to a climbing wall filled with enemies. Whether or not you engage with them, there’ll be a grappling hook node at the end of the section to get to another platform with another group of enemies.
You’re not done yet. At the end of this section, there’s another climbing wall that leads you to the last area with enemies. Here, the datapad is on the roof of the hut. This will open up the Safehouse’s door where you can claim the console inside.
Heritage Opus SafehouseThe NightcapYou’ll find the datapad and Safehouse in a cave in the Windspear area. To get the datapad, climb the platform in the middle, jump to the other platform ahead in the corner, and you’ll find a climbing wall. Use the wall to get some elevation and then jump, then glide to the last platform. Here, you’ll find the datapad lying on the ground.
The Nightcap SafehouseSnowy WellsYou’ll find the Snowy Wells Safehouse in the Stoneblood Forest. To get the datapad, use the grappling nook on the right side of the Safehouse. After that, jump to the top of the Safehouse to find another grappling hook on the watertower. From there, glide to the cliff area in front of you, and then glide again to the building across from the cliff. There, you’ll find the datapad sitting on a box.
Snowy Wells SafehouseCarcadia BurnWildhorn’s BeardIn the western region of Kairos, called Carcadia Burn, in Ruined Sumplands, Wildhorn’s Beard Safehouse is at the top of the map, near a chain of smaller islands. Once you reach the spot, you’ll see a mountain structure where you can run around a sort-of spiral staircase. At the end of it, you’ll find the datapad sitting on a boat. That’ll open up the Safehouse, and you can go inside and claim the console.
Wildhorn’s Beard SafehouseThe LowriseIn Tonnage Peel, you’ll find the Lowrise Safehouse. Once you get there, use the grappling hook node and go through the first pipe. Make your way forward by jumping on the platforms, and then use the next grappling hook node. This’ll lead you to the Safehouse. The datapad is behind the Safehouse on your left, where you’ll find another rock protruding out from the edge. On it, you’ll find the datapad sitting there. Go inside the Safehouse and claim the console.
The Lowrise SafehouseMakeshift ChaletMakeshift Chalet is the last Safehouse in the Carcadia Burn region. It can be found in the Lopside area, inside an enemy base. Like Wyclef’s Reprieve, the datapad is under and behind the Safehouse. To get your hands on the datapad, locate the gap in the fencing next to the left side of the Safehouse, and then drop down to the ledge below . Continue forward by dropping down further, and you’ll soon find the datapad lying on a box. Now that you have the datapad, claim the Safehouse by using the console found right outside the Safehouse.

It’s at the very end of the district wall, before you can loop around and go back to the Carcadia District. The datapad is easy to find, as it’s sitting on a pile of trash in the middle of the area.
