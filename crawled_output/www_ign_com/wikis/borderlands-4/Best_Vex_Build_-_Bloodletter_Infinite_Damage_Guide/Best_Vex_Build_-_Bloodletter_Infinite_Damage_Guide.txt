This build does absolutely insane damage, so much so that you'd better use it quickly because it will likely get patched out at some point.
This build essentially breaks the game, allowing you to destroy any boss in approximately one hit. If that sounds like something you're looking for, you will find everything you need to know to get started in this Borderlands 4 guide.
Skills Equipment Specializations SkillsSkills are the crux of this build. With the right ones equipped and the right combination of weapons and weapon effects to accompany them, you will become an absolute fiend on the field. There are a number of skills to choose from, though, making it hard to pick.
For this build, however, you are going to want to focus on unlocking the following ones. Click a skill to see more information on it: Borderlands 4 Vex Bleed Build Skills

Stats
Gun and Skill Critical Hits have a chance to apply Bleed, causing Kinetic Status Effect Damage over time for a duration.Bleed is affected by Status Effect Application Chance, and is itself considered a Status Effect.
- Chance: 50%- Damage: 54% of Gun Damage per second.- Duration: 4 Seconds.- Max Stacks: 20.
The beating heart of this build is Bloodletter. That is really the crux of it, and everything else revolves around this one skill. The Bloodletter skill allows you to apply the Bleed Status Effect to an opponent when you land a Critical Hit.
This is key because when combined with some other effects and items that we will go over later, all damage becomes a Critical Hit. This allows Bleed to just stack and stack and stack almost infinitely, and absolutely no foe will be able to stand a chance against you. Even the strongest of bosses will melt within seconds.
Cold IronCold Iron

Stats
Vex gains increased Gun Damage.Minion(s) gain additional Gun Damage.
- Gun Damage: +15%- Minion Gun Damage: +30%
The Cold Iron skill can be found in the Spectre/The Fourth Seal skill tree. It increases both you and your Minion's Gun Damage, which, once you progress into Specializations, will also increase your Skill Damage. Having any type of damage increase is always helpful, particularly in terms of your Minions, and guns are, of course, a cornerstone of any Borderlands 4 build.
Portents of SufferingPortents of Suffering
Icon
Description
Stats
Vex and her Minion(s) gain increased Status Effect Damage.
- Status Effect Damage: +35%
Portents of Suffering is another excellent skill for this build. The Bleed dealt by crit shots with Bloodletter counts as a Status Effect, so Portents of Suffering helps capitalize on that Bleed Damage.
Idle HandsIdle Hands
Icon
Description
Stats
Vex and her Minion(s) gain Reload Speed based on the fullness of her Health.
- Reload Speed: +30% at full Health.
Idle Hands is not a skill related to Bloodletter or Bleed at all, but it is still an extremely handy one to have. This build focuses on a Sniper as one of its weapons of choice, and those don't always have the most ammo to play around with. This skill allows you to reload much faster as long as you are at full Health.
Grave FiendsGrave Fiends
Icon
Description
Stats
Kill Skill. Vex and her Minion(s) deal increased Damage.
- Damage Dealt: +5.0% +2.5 per Stack.- Max Stacks: 3- Stack Duration: 16 seconds.
Grave Fiends is a pure damage-increasing skill designed to boost the damage of both you and your Minions. This comes in very handy as you can never really go wrong with damage-boosting skills; they will always be helpful regardless of what build, weapon, or Vault Hunter you're using.
Prismatic IchorPrismatic Ichor
Icon
Description
Stats
When Vex or her Minions apply a Status Effect, apply another random Elemental Status Effect.
- Damage: 150% of the initial Status Effect.- Cooldown: 2 seconds.
While some of the other skills are more flexible and can be switched out for something else, Prismatic Ichor is definitely one you will want to unlock for the Bloodletter build. Prismatic Ichor automatically applies another random Status Effect to your target once you inflict it with one, in this case, Bleed.
Bleed is all but guaranteed with this build, so having the opportunity to apply yet another random Status Effect that boosts your overall damage dealt by 150% is insane. Whatever skills you choose on top of Bloodletter, make sure this one makes the cut.
Keen SufferingKeen Suffering

Stats
Status Effect Damage gains a chance to Critically Hit.
- Critical Hit Chance: +20%
Keen Suffering is another skill that directly links in with this Bleed build. Every time you deal Status Effect Damage, which is going to happen a lot, it has a 20% chance of becoming a Critical Hit. This really helps to keep the Bleed Status Effects rolling and allows you to deal even more damage than you were before.
Leeching AttunementLeeching Attunement
Icon
Description
Stats
Attunement Skill: While Vex is Attuned to Kinetic, she gains Lifesteal and increased Reload Speed. These effects persist for a duration after Attunement is switched.
- Lifesteal: +10%- Reload Speed: +25%- Attunement Duration: 6 seconds.
Leeching Attunement allows you to leech life from your enemies while using Kinetic weapons. Using Kinetic as your main damage source should really be your focus, not only because it is an excellent element, but also so you can capitalize on that Lifesteal from Leeching Attunement.
Material ComponentsMaterial Components

Description
Stats
Vex gains increased Kinetic Damage and Kinetic Status Effect Damage.
- Kinetic Damage: +35%- Kinetic Status Effect Damage: +20%
Material Components is a great skill for this build in two ways. First, if you're using a Kinetic weapon, it is going to boost your damage on the initial hit. Then, it is going to boost the damage of your Bleed Status Effect. Getting that extra damage boost in not one but two areas related to the Bloodletter build makes Material Components a perfect skill for this scenario.
Target PrescienceTarget Prescience

Description
Stats
Vex's Gun Damage gains Critical Hit Chance against any part of enemies.
- Gun Critical Hit Chance: +15%
Maxing out your Gun Critical Hit chance means more Bleed and more damage for your enemies. This build is really about maxing out any sort of Critical Hit Chance, and since guns are a major weapon group in Borderlands 4, this skill is essential. You really want to try and get a crit as soon as possible with this build, so take any opportunity you can to boost that effect, and you will be thankful for it later.
Keen MindKeen Mind

Description
Stats
Vex's Skill Damage gains Critical Hit Chance against any part of enemies.
- Skill Critical Hit Chance: +12% +3%
Keen Mind is essentially Target Prescience, but for skills instead of guns. This allows any Skill Damage to possibly become a Critical Hit, yet again increasing your chance of inflicting Bleed on your enemy. Even without the guaranteed Crit from the knife we will be going over later in the build, this greatly increases your chances of inflicting Bleed on your target.
EquipmentEquipment is the second-most important part of this build, with one item, in particular, really making all the difference. A craftsman is only as good as his tools, or so they say, so making sure you pick up and earn some good ones is essential to making this build even better.
The three things you are going to want to worry about most are weapons, your Repkit, and your Ordnance. Click the links below to see what we recommend:
Weapons Repkit OrdnanceWeaponsIn terms of weapons, the main one used for this build is the Hungry Eviscerating Stray Legendary Sniper Rifle. You can pick this one up from Pango and Bango, two twin bosses from the Carcadia Burn region.
It has great DPS and two homing bullets on either side of the one you shoot that seek out the nearest enemy, allowing you to hit targets you weren't even aiming for. That essentially offers you two extra shots, and you don't even have to aim them! They might hone in on the enemy you were shooting or a whole other enemy, but either way, that's still free shots for you. If you can't find this weapon, one thing to look for in a replacement is a Jakobs part. That will be important later on.
Another good weapon to have on hand is a spreadlauncher, preferably one that deals high damage. A spreadlauncher is going to maximize your targets, allowing you to deal Bleed to more enemies more efficiently.
In addition to that, a high-damage sniper is going to be a good candidate for your arsenal. For this build and most others, in fact. The Cooking Unseen Borstel Ballista is a great and powerful choice, but it is not essential. Any high-damage sniper would be fine.
RepkitThere are tons of Repkits you can find in Borderlands 4, and many of them would work great with this build. The one that is being used for this current build is the Standard Caffeinated Recorporator. That Repkit has an Order effect, giving it extra uses, as well as an Amp effect.
Amp essentially amplifies the damage of your next shot, this time by +200%, which is massive and goes a long way towards boosting your overall damage with this build. The strat with this Repkit is to use it, then shoot your enemy with your spreadlauncher or sniper to take advantage of that massive damage boost.
OrdnanceFor your Ordnance, you are going to want to go with a throwing knife, a Jakobs Throwing Knife, specifically, like the Fully Loaded Vivisecting Throwing Knife. That one has the Penetrator Augment that's going to enhance the Damage Amp Payload, which is also on there.
This Throwing Knife is the one thing that is going to ensure that you can inflict that Bleed over and over again and continue landing Critical Hits, allowing it to stack exponentially. The strat with this is to hit your target with the Knife, then shoot them and watch them Bleed to death, essentially. Once you gather all of the right gear for this build, you might even be able to land it in one shot.
Other EquipmentFor your Class Mods, Enhancements, and Shield, you have some flexibility. Some things to look out for, though, are Gun Critical Hit and Action Skill Critical Hit effects, and anything that increases the chance of a Jakobs weapon landing a Critical Hit. When paired with your Jakobs gun, you are increasing and stacking those Bleeds up even more.
SpecializationsThe last thing that makes this build come together is your Specializations. It's important to remember here that Bleed is applying as Skill Damage, so ones like I Am A Gun and Honed Mind are going to help out with that by increasing Crit Chance and Damage.
In addition to those, the other one that is really going to make sure you are applying that Bleed is Contamination. Contamination means that any Critical Hit gains increased Status Effect Application Chance. Criting is all but guaranteed in this build, so Contamination really just boosts that Bleed chance even more, helping the whole thing come together.
