All Dissected Plateau Marcus Bobbleheads CollectedVault Hunter’s Guide to Kairos Location in Dissected PlateauA Vault Hunter’s Guide to Kairos: The OutboundersA Vault Hunter’s Guide to Kairos: The Fields are AliveThis collectible is a little south of the center of the Dissected Plateau region. It’s southeast of the Zadra’s Backup Plan fast travel station, which is also The Stubs point of interest. Following the road from south to north, the road bends inward toward a small building on stilts next to the road.
Beyond this building is a lean-to, some fences, and a training dummy made out of tires. You’ll find the guide hanging on a wooden post just before reaching the training dummy.
ECHO Log Locations in Dissected PlateauGround Beef ECHO LogGround Beef ECHO LogThis ECHO Log is near the bottom of the Dissected Plateau region. You’ll find it northeast of the Wyclef’s Reprieve Safehouse from the Idolator’s Noose region. It’s also north and a little west of the point of interest, The Killing Floors. Before entering that massive Order base, you can head to the left or north to see a long building with a green roof.
It has a few silos attached to it on the right side of the building as well. Duck underneath the long overhang and you’ll find the ECHO Log on a hay bale. It’s a little to the right of the stable portion of this building.
A Laughable Goal ECHO LogA Laughable Goal ECHO LogThis ECHO Log is near the Zadra’s Backup Plan fast travel station, which is also near The Stubs point of interest. These are near the center of the Dissected Plateau region, but closer to the western border. If you use the fast travel station and are facing the vending machines, head to the right.
Then, jump the railing to drop a little bit. Make another right up some stairs and finally another right at the top of those stairs. You’ll see a room with a white chair lying down. To the right of that is an ECHO Log on top of a counter, next to a sink.
Regifting ECHO LogRegifting ECHO LogSimilar to the previous ECHO Log, this one is near the Zadra’s Backup Plan fast travel station. It’s near The Stubs point of interest, which is near the center of the Dissected Plateau region. If you use the fast travel station and are facing the vending machines, head to the right.
Jump over the railing straight ahead and turn a tiny bit to the left. The echo log will be on a gray metal table, next to a computer monitor. This spot is to the right of a small kitchen area.
A Day in the Order: Weapons Training ECHO LogA Day in the Order: Weapons Training ECHO LogThis ECHO Log is near the northeast side of the Dissected Plateau, as far as what is accessible. It’s southeast of the Deep Seven Order Silo, at the Synthetic Nave point of interest. Which is also a large Order base. Follow the road to make your way inside. Continue working your way through until you get to a large door opening with seven red triangles above it.
Look to your left a little before reaching the door and you’ll see the ECHO Log on a gray metal crate. Be careful here since you’ll be dealing with a lot of Order enemies nearby.
A Day in the Order: Safety Precautions ECHO LogA Day in the Order: Safety Precautions ECHO LogThis ECHO Log is deep inside the Synthetic Nave point of interest, so there’s going to be a lot of information here to follow. First, if you didn’t already grab the previous A Day in the Order ECHO Log, this point of interest is in the northeast portion of the Dissected Plateau.
You’ll need to follow the path inside, eventually passing through a large doorway with seven red triangles above it. Now continue straight until you reach the elevator on the other side of the room. Using the button on the left side of the elevator, continue up it.
Continue straight into a large room with a pillar in the center and computer screens wrapped around it. You can follow the wall to the left until you reach the north corner. Here, there will be a vent above you that you can pull open with a grappling hook. That will reveal a grappling hook spot to pull yourself up to the vent.
If you’ve done this before in the Borderlands 4 story, the door below the vent may already be open. Both paths lead to the same room with a giant green capsule inside. When looking at the green capsule after leaving the vent, go to the right of it on the eastern side. There will be some barrels here covered by a blue tarp where the ECHO Log is.
A Day in the Order: Approved Terminology ECHO LogA Day in the Order: Approved Terminology ECHO LogThis ECHO Log is deep inside the Synthetic Nave point of interest, so there’s a lot of information here to follow. First, if you didn’t already grab the previous A Day in the Order ECHO Logs, this point of interest is in the northeast portion of the Dissected Plateau.
You’ll need to follow the path inside, eventually passing through a large doorway with seven red triangles above it. This is where the two vending machines are. Continue past them, then make a left, then a right, and continue straight for a little
You’ll enter another open doorway as you pass under some scaffolding into a hallway. After the next doorway, you’ll be in a much larger room with a pit in the middle. Work your way around the left until you reach a door on the other side.
Entering the next room, this open pathway leads south. You should see a second-story area up ahead with a broken window to the left. Make your way toward the broken window, continue underneath, and move past it. There will be a door to your left that you can proceed through.
Follow the linear path up to the computer room. Once you enter inside, continue straight to the table of electronics and computers where the ECHO Log is. It’s on the northwest side of the room.
The exo-rift works! ECHO LogThe exo-rift works! ECHO LogThis ECHO Log requires completing a side mission, but first let’s discuss where it is. It’s in the northwest portion of the Dissected Plateau, below the Deep Seven Order Silo. Which is southwest of the Motherbird Node. Below the Order Silo and to the right a little is a large building. The door here will be closed if you haven’t completed the side mission, Exit Through the Rift Shop.
This side mission is in the Hungering Plain, near the northeast side, a tiny bit east of the Purge Guard point of interest. A person suddenly falls out of the sky, landing flat on the road. Interacting with their body will start the mission and immediately open the locked door from before.
Enter through the now-open door, and immediately on your left near two tall skinny lights, you’ll see the ECHO Log. It’s resting on a cabinet between two white couches. This is also near the next ECHO Log in this guide as well. And others further down if you continue this side mission.
Lunch is mine! ECHO LogLunch is mine! ECHO LogThis ECHO Log is in the same location and has the same requirements as the previous one, so we’ll repeat that info here: It’s in the northwest portion of the Dissected Plateau, below the Deep Seven Order Silo. Which is southwest of the Motherbird Node. Below the Order Silo and to the right a little is a large building. The door here will be closed if you haven’t completed the side mission, Exit Through the Rift Shop.
This side mission is in the Hungering Plain, near the northeast side, a tiny bit east of the Purge Guard point of interest. A person suddenly falls out of the sky, landing flat on the road. Interacting with their body will start the mission and immediately open the locked door from before.
Enter through the now-open door, continue down the small set of steps, and make a sharp right turn immediately. Go directly into that corner where a couple of white couches are and a table with the ECHO Log on it.
Subject 1418 ECHO LogSubject 1418 ECHO LogThis ECHO Log location should confuse you since the only way to reach it is through a rift portal related to a side mission. You’ll need to start the side mission, Exit Through the Rift Shop. This side mission can be started in the Hungering Plain, near the northeast side, a tiny bit east of the Purge Guard point of interest.
A person suddenly falls out of the sky, landing flat on the road. Interacting with their body will start the mission, unlocking a door we need to head to next. If you’ve completed the previous ECHO Logs in this guide, you’ll know where we’re going. This previously locked door is in the northwest portion of the Dissected Plateau region, below the Deep Seven Order Silo.
It’s slightly below the Order Silo and to the right a little, where a large building is. Head inside and continue the side mission until you return back to this building and can head through a pink rift portal. This will teleport you to the inside of a facility where the Subject 1418 ECHO Log is.
Since this is a linear path forward, all you have to do is fight through enemies to the east and then northeast. You’ll end up in a larger room with three large white pillars with glowing red lights inside them. Continue beyond those pillars to the east and head up to the second story. You can take the stairs or use a grappling hook node.
The first room has the Subject 1418 ECHO Log inside, which is the northernmost room. It’s on top of a large case lying on the floor. Also, you’ll find another ECHO Log nearby in the next section of this guide. And a third in the next section after that.
Subject 1015 ECHO LogThis ECHO Log follows the same path as the previous one: This ECHO Log location should confuse you since the only way to reach it is through a rift portal related to a side mission. You’ll need to start the side mission, Exit Through the Rift Shop. This side mission can be started in the Hungering Plain, near the northeast side, a tiny bit east of the Purge Guard point of interest.

You can take the stairs or use a grappling hook node.
The first room near the stairs has the Subject 1418 ECHO Log. We’ll need to enter the third room to the south, where the Subject 1015 ECHO Log is. It’s inside the room, lying on a large case, close to the floor.
Eridium warning! ECHO LogEridium warning!

You can take the stairs or use a grappling hook node.
Now on the second story, head past the rooms to the south, then turn to your right facing west. There’s a vent you can grapple open and crawl into. Make your way to the end until you enter a new room. As you drop out of the vent, the Eridium warning! ECHO Log will be right in front of you if you’re facing north. It’s on top of a long crate.
Dead Bolt Location in Dissected PlateauDead Bolt 1Dissected Plateau Dead Bolt 1Safety Tips ECHO LogThis Dead Bolt is south of the center of the Dissected Plateau region, but also east of The Killing Floors point of interest. You’ll need to go northeast of The Killing Floors Order base to find a cut-through that leads behind the base. This opening has some Mangler cave spawners nearby as well.
Follow the dirt path southeast until it leads into a clearing with Wildhorns and some water. You’ll find this Dead Bolt and ECHO Log Safety Tips beneath a large tree to the southeast. It’s surrounded by shallow water. You can also defeat all nearby enemies to unlock the red chest nearby.
Lost Capsule Location in Dissected PlateauLost Capsule 1Dissected Plateau Lost Capsule 1This Lost Capsule is near the southwest corner of the Dissected Plateau region. It's also exactly where the Boglight Vigilance point of interest is, which is south of Wyclef's Reprieve. After crossing a skinny wooden bridge, you'll be on an isolated island with a large lighthouse ahead of you.
Instead of continuing toward the lighthouse, follow the path to the left or south-southeast from the bridge. This leads underneath a different building that runs alongside the island. Pass through the structure and you'll end up at a broken bridge. You can grapple the Lost Capsule from here or hop across to get it. The closest Decrypt Station is in Wyclaf's Reprieve to get 15 SDU and some gear.
Propaganda Speaker Locations in Dissected PlateauPropaganda Speaker 1Dissected Plateau Propaganda Speaker 1This Propaganda Speaker is near the southwest corner of the Dissected Plateau region. It’s east of the Boglight Vigilance point of interest and south of The Killing Floors point of interest. Below the large order base, you’ll find the Propaganda Speaker in a crater surrounded by big purple eridium crystals.
Unlike many other Propaganda Speakers, this one will attract a swarm of tunneling Threshers to deal with. Do your best to attack them from afar unless you have a build that prefers to get up close.
Propaganda Speaker 2Dissected Plateau Propaganda Speaker 2This Propaganda Speaker is in the northwest corner of the Dissected Plateau region. It’s close to the Motherbird Node point of interest, which is a little northwest of the Deep Seven Order Silo. If you have this Order Silo, you can fast travel to it and relatively easily walk over to the Propaganda Speaker.
Otherwise, you’ll need to climb the wall on the west side of the Mortherbird Node point of interest, near the Dissected Plateau border. This is on the left side of the Order base that the Order Silo is attached to. Since this area is a little high up, you may want to start at the bottom of the Order Silo and follow the wall west until you reach a wooden bridge. This leads to a grapple node that if you continue following the wall on your right, will lead to the climbable wall.
Continue east after climbing up where you’ll encounter some Kratch and Order enemies. Eventually, you’ll reach an opening to the south that leads directly to the Propaganda Speaker. Completing this Propaganda Speaker will give you 20 SDU.
Survivalist Cache Location in Dissected PlateauSurvivalist Cache 1Dissected Plateau Survivalist Cache 1This Survivalist Cache is a hidden one in the northwest portion of the Dissected Plateau region. The map marker is at a road intersection east and a little south of the Deep Seven Order Silo. This is also northwest of the Synthetic Nave point of interest.
Once you discover this marker, if you go exactly where it is near the bus stop, you’ll see an antenna to the east. This is a clue where below the antenna is an open sewer pipe you can travel through. It leads right to the Survivalist Cache.
Evocarium Location in Dissected PlateauEvocarium 1Dissected Plateau Evocarium 1Warmth ECHO LogThis Evocarium is west of the center of the Dissected Plateau region. It’s east of the Zadra’s Backup Plan fast travel station, which is also near The Stubs point of interest. The Evocarium device used to scan for Memordium Orbs is surrounded by a Ripper encampment. You’ll need to charge through to get to the back of a platform on top of a large rock pillar in the center.
The back of this rock pillar has a climbable wall to reach the device. You can reach this spot from either the left or right side of the encampment. You’ll then find the device next to a campfire. As usual, interact with it to scan for where each orb is. Here’s how to get each one:
To the northwest, one orb is on top of a small shack that you can climb onto the roof of. You may not reach it from where the Evocarium device is. So if you need to, you can climb the stairs that lead up to it. To the east, slightly north, another orb is on top of a building beyond the climbable wall. It has a large red circle with a face spray-painted onto the front of the building. You may be able to reach this roof if you jump from the raised area where the device is. Otherwise, you can walk onto the roof from the left or right side. The final orb is to the southeast, a little farther than the rest were. It’s on top of another shack, but this one is held up by some wooden stilts. You likely won’t be able to reach it from the device area, but that’s okay. You can climb onto the roof using some nearby crates from the eastern side of it.Completing this Evocarium in the Dissected Plateau will reward you with 15 SDU and give you the Warmth ECHO Log.
Vault Symbol Locations in Dissected PlateauVault Symbol 1Dissected Plateau Vault Symbol 1This Vault Symbol is west of the center of the Dissected Plateau region, inside the point of interest, The Stubs. This is also near the Zadra’s Backup Plan fast travel station, but it isn’t underground like that spot is.
Instead, you’ll find it in an area filled with rusted metal and destroyed ship parts. You can see the large rusted brown thruster jutting out towards the road. If you head towards this there’s a ramp that leads into the area. Follow that ramp and then go south over a nearby ledge. Continue south going up one set of stairs, but not over another ledge.
Then turn southeast from these stairs and you’ll see a bundle of trees the Vault Symbol is hidden behind. It’s on the side of a ship engine or thruster wall. Interacting with this will give you 5 SDU.
Vault Symbol 2Dissected Plateau Vault Symbol 2This Vault Symbol is near the southwest corner of the Dissected Plateau region inside the large Order base here. It’s part of The Killing Floors' point of interest. Getting to this Vault Symbol requires following the main story, but we’ll still dive into the steps to reaching it.
You’ll need to cross the bridge and then go northeast, following the black road with blinking red arrows on it. Continue following it until you're inside a little chamber corridor. If you already did this main mission, you’ll still need to repeat this step from it. Pull the green lever above you to pour guts on you.
Then, continue following the same black road with red blinking arrows. You’ll eventually hit a dead end where a little camera will scan you. As long as the guts are on you, you’ll then be sucked up into the tubes above. Make sure to jump before you reach the grinding pit coming up.
Make your way across the room to the west side. If you’ve already been here before, the door may be open, but you should climb the metal wall on your right instead. This wall is toward the northwest. Follow the linear path forward until you drop from a vent into a room with bright red lighting.
Directly to your right should be a window, where you can see the Vault Symbol through it. Continue forward and turn to your right, where the doorway is into this office. Interact with the Vault Symbol for 5 SDU.
Marcus Bobblehead Locations in Dissected PlateauMarcus Bobblehead 1Dissected Plateau Marcus Bobblehead 1This Marcus Bobblehead is deep inside the Synthetic Nave point of interest, which is near the northeast side of the Dissected Plateau region. It’s a large Order base that you’ll have to head inside to get this collectible.
Make your way inside, fighting off Order enemies until you reach a large door opening with seven red triangles above it. Continue through, as you pass two vending machines. Afterward, make a left, then a right, and continue straight for a little. You’ll enter another open doorway as you pass under some scaffolding. After the next doorway, you’ll be in a much larger room with a pit in the middle. Work your way around the left until you reach a door on the other side.
Entering the next room, this open pathway leads south. You should see a second-story area up ahead with a broken window to the left. Make your way toward the broken window and continue underneath and past it. There will be a door to your left you can proceed through.
This linear path leads to a computer room where right as you enter it, there are three lockers on your left. This Marcus Bobblehead is on top of them.
Marcus Bobblehead 2Dissected Plateau Marcus Bobblehead 2This Marcus Bobblehead is near the southwest corner of the Dissected Plateau region. It's also exactly where the Boglight Vigilance point of interest is, which is south of Wyclef's Reprieve. After crossing a skinny wooden bridge, you'll be on an isolated island with a large lighthouse ahead of you.
You'll need to climb the lighthouse all the way to the top where this Marcus Bobblehead is. It's near the fan at the top, facing the west-northwest side. If you're having trouble getting to where the fan is, check behind the lighthouse bulb. You'll find some crates you can double-jump off of.
