Weapon Aspects are new and unique abilities that you can craft and apply to your weapons to help you in battle. These Aspects are permanent upgrades, so you don't have to worry about losing them on each run like you do with Boons.
On this page, we will have everything you need to know about Aspects, including how to unlock them and how to use them.
How to Unlock Weapon Aspects How to Use Weapon Aspects All AspectsHow to Unlock Weapon Aspects in Hades 2To unlock the ability to craft and use Aspects, you must first create all five weapons available in the game and use each of them at least once on a run. Crafting all five weapons is a decent challenge in itself that requires you to reach most of the areas on the surface and in the Underworld.
Once you've crafted and used each of the five Nocturnal Arms, speak to Headmistress Hecate to receive the Aspects of Night and Darkness Incantation. The exact time or location where she gives you the Incantation can vary. You may be able to receive the recipe in the Crossroads, but you may also have to defeat her in battle in Erebus to receive the Incantation.
The Aspects of Night and Darkness is the key to unlocking Aspects. Once you receive the recipe from Hecate, you are free to get straight to work on collecting the items required to cast the spell. You will need the following items to cast the Aspects of Night and Darkness Incantation:
5x Bronze 1x NightshadeNightshade is the easiest ingredient to source. You can find the seeds hidden in soil patches throughout Erebus. You will need to complete a run there with the Silver Spade equipped to collect them.
Bronze is a little harder to get your hands on as it is only found on the surface. The door to Olympus is right opposite the door to the Underworld, but it is locked at the start of the game. You will have to cast two more Incantations to reach it, one being the Permeation of Witching Wards Incantation to open the gate and the Unraveling a Fateful Bond Incantation that allows you to breathe the air on Olympus and explore unhindered.
Once you've cast those two spells, complete a run through Olympus with your Crescent Pick equipped. You can collect Bronze from the abandoned sets of armor on the surface. After collecting all the required ingredients, head back to the Crossroads once you fall and craft the Incantation to unlock Weapons Aspects.
How to Use Weapons Aspects in Hades 2Weapons Aspects can be unlocked at the Silver Pool, and there are three for each weapon. It is worth noting, however, that the game is still in early access, so more Aspects or even more Nocturnal Arms may be introduced later on.
Each Weapon Aspect needs to be crafted using resources. The only exception to this is the Aspect of Melinoe, which is unlocked by default. You can find all of the Aspects and what materials they require on the first tab of the Silver Pools menu. Once you've unlocked an Aspect, you can upgrade it to level 5 using more resources. The upgrades are available on the second tab of the Silver Pools menu.
If you have the materials required to craft and equip an Aspect or Aspect Upgrade, hover over the Aspect or Upgrade you want and press the action button to confirm your choice.
