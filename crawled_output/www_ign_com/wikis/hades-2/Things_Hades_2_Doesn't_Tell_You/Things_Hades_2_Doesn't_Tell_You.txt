On this page, we will go over some of the features that Hades 2 might not fully explain, that we think will help you out the most on your runs.
Give Nectar, Get PrizesYou’ve probably heard of the “romance options” in Hades 2, and while that’s not completely accurate, you can deepen your bonds with characters by giving them Nectar. This sweet concoction is found in rooms marked by the Nectar symbol: orange liquid in a round vessel.
You can gift Nectar to any character before interacting with them normally, including the Olympic gods. The first time you do this with any character, you’ll receive their Keepsake. These trinkets can be equipped at your display case before starting a run, and they all come with unique bonuses. For the main gods, these Keepsakes increase the odds of encountering them during a run and enhancing their Boons when you do.
The Olympic PoolSpeaking of gods, know that the game will pull just a few from the full pantheon per run. In other words, you’ll only run into three to four unique gods each time. This is beneficial because it lets you focus on certain builds without worrying about accumulating too many perks that don’t work as well together. If you prefer one god over another, consider equipping their aforementioned Keepsake to increase your chances of finding them.
Boon CategoriesWhen selecting your Boons from the gods, you might notice that many fall into certain core categories, augmenting your attack, special, cast, sprint, and magick recovery. Once you choose a Boon that slots into one of those, you very likely won’t get a chance to replace it for some time. Again, this is actually to your benefit since choosing a Boon of the same type will replace the current one rather than giving you an additional effect. Doing so will at least increase that Boon’s rarity.
Eventually, you’ll unlock Duo Boons, which combine the might of two gods into one bonus. If you have two Boon slots taken up by two different gods, you’ll increase your odds of these becoming available. Duo Boons are very powerful and can be worth focusing your whole build around.
If you’ve chosen several Boons from one god during a run, then you have a decent chance of being offered a Legendary Boon later in the game.  Double Boon RoomsAt some point during a run, you may encounter doors marked by two different god icons. In the following room, you can choose to receive a Boon from one of them, which will be an insult to the other. That kicks off a combat encounter in which the spurned god will try to strike you down with their special attack. Survive, and you’ll actually be able to get a Boon from them too.
Obviously, these double boon rooms can be quite dangerous, but bagging yourself two Boons for the price of one is well worth the trouble.
Armored EnemiesYou’ll quickly notice that some enemies in Hades 2 have a yellow health bar overtop the regular red one: this is armor. While it’s active, they’ll take reduced damage and cannot be staggered by your attacks. The good news is that other effects such as freeze do still apply here. Those make it much easier to whittle down the armor bar and finally break through their defenses.
Canceling AttacksIf you get too caught up in attacking and want to dodge cancel, know that you cannot do that in this game. You can, however, cancel out of a standard attack by using your special. This is particularly useful for those of you who prefer the Moonstone Axe. It’s slower, with attacks that require a windup. Since its special move is a guard, canceling into this when you need to defend will actually save you a good amount of damage.
Changing FateIf you aren’t happy with your choices in Hades 2, you can always refresh them with a Change of Fate, represented by a little dice. These can be used to change the symbol on a door, therefore changing the reward in the next room, or to reroll your boon options when encountering a god. So if you don’t like your options, make a change. Sometimes the results are quite an upgrade.
To get Changes of Fate, you need to equip specific Arcana Cards before a run. The Fates, The Seer, and The Champion all confer this item.
Increasing GraspWhile on the topic of Arcana Cards, Melinoe can only equip a limited amount, and this is governed by her Grasp. That’s represented by the green segmented circle around her on the right side of the Arcana screen. What you might not realize is that you can actually tab over to the part of the screen and click on it. By spending Psyche, you can increase your Grasp and equip more cards at once.
Taking Advantage Of TrapsYou should use every tool at your disposal to make it through Hades 2's randomly generated rooms, and that includes environmental hazards. Attacking certain objects will actually work in your favor in each region.
Erebus, for example, has trees that can be chopped down, damaging enemies as they hit the ground. Oceanus is full of water jets and explosive tanks. If you can catch enemies in your Cast around traps like this, you can cause a lot of damage by barely lifting a finger.
Understanding TimersThe rooms you conquer are also tied to certain timers back at the Crossroads, such as Hecate’s cauldron or Charon’s chest. You can also plant seeds in a small garden plot near Odysseus. The timer over these objects indicates how many more rooms you need to clear before the brew, chest, or plant is ready. So when you see zero, it's time to collect your items.
Saving & QuittingFinally, if you need to pause and come back to a run later, you can do that. Just hit quit in the pause menu. Your progress is naturally saved whenever you enter a new area, whether this be crossing from the main area to the Training Grounds at the Crossroads, from a run back to Melinoe's tent, or crossing from one room into another during a run.
If you hit quit in the pause menu during a run, you will find yourself at the beginning of that room the next time you open your game. So don't feel like you have to give up or sacrifice a run just because you need a break!
