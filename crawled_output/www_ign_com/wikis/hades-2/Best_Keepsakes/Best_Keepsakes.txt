Each Keepsake has a unique effect that gives you some sort of boost to take on your runs with you. On this page, you will find all of the best Keepsakes Hades 2, including where to get them, what effects they have, and the best circumstances in which to use them.
You can switch Keepsakes in between each Location after casting the Kindred Keepsakes Incantation at the Cauldron in the Crossroads.
Luckier Tooth: Schelemeus Ghost Onion: Dora White Antler: Artemis Evil Eye: Nemesis Knuckle Bones: Odysseus Lion Fang: Heracles Silken Sash: Arachne Silver Wheel: Hecate Concave Stone: Echo Olympian God Keepsakes New Keepsakes have been added with the v.1.0 Launch of Hades II. We'll test them soon to see if any of them make the cut! Luckier ToothLuckier Tooth
Schelemeus
After you fall to zero health, automatically restore 51 Health once this night. - Upgrade 1: 76 Health Restored. - Upgrade 2: 101 Health Restored.
Schelemeus's Keepsake, the Luckier Tooth, is essentially another Death Defiance, reviving you with at least 51 HP after you meet your demise on the surface or in the Underworld.
The other main source of Death Defiances is the Eternity Arcana Card, which revives you with 40% of your HP when you die. Of course, your total amount of HP will vary in each run depending on how many Centaur Hearts and the like you collect, but Schelemeus's Keepsake revives you with up to 101 HP when it's fully upgraded, which is far more than 40% in most cases. This makes the Luckier Tooth potentially the best Death Defiance in Hades 2.
Your ideal goal is obviously to not die at all, but death is inevitable in Hades 2, so an extra life is always welcomed!
Ghost OnionGhost Onion
Dora
Whenever you exit a Location, fully restore your Health, up to a total of 50 this night. - Upgrade 1: 75 Health Restored. - Upgrade 2: 100 Health Restored.
Dora's Ghost Onion is incredibly helpful in the early game. Eventually, as you start getting better and better and the regular enemies don't give you as much trouble as they used to, you will need the Ghost Onion less. This is particularly true in the later stages of the run, where you may have earned a few Centaur Hearts, and 100 HP doesn't seem like such a huge amount anymore.
But when you first start your adventure in Hades 2, the Ghost Onion is incredibly helpful for instances where you want to keep your HP up until you reach a certain boss you're struggling with or when you want to quickly recover your HP when you enter a new Location after a rough boss battle.
White AntlerWhite Antler
Artemis
While you have no more than 20 health, you have a 20% chance to deal critical damage. - Upgrade 1: 30% Critical Chance.- Upgrade 2: 40% Critical Chance.
If you're looking for a Keepsake to boost your attack stats instead of your HP, the White Antler from Artemis is an excellent choice. This Keepsake boosts your critical strike chance when you're low on health, which can make all the difference in the final moments of a tough boss fight or even a difficult Encounter.
Critical strikes deal far more damage than any regular attack would, and when this Keepsake is fully upgraded, you have a 40% chance of landing one. These are pretty good odds and can give you the extra boost you need to turn the tides of battle.
Evil EyeEvil Eye
Nemesis
Deal 20% additional damage to the last foe that vanquished you. - Upgrade 1: 25% Additional Damage.- Upgrade 2: 30% Additional Damage.
The Evil Eye is the best Keepsake in the game for times when you are stuck on a particularly difficult boss. When fully upgraded, the Evil Eye allows you to do 30% more damage than usual against the last enemy that killed you, which is a massive upgrade in strength.
The Evil Eye will know exactly what enemy last killed you, even if you aren't wearing it. This can be problematic if you get knocked out of your run by a regular enemy before you reach the boss, as it really shines in Guardian battles. The Evil Eye is a lifesaver (literally) when you are trying to overcome someone like Chronos or even Scylla and the Sirens or another boss, so if you get knocked out before reaching them, the Evil Eye will be out of the running until you make your way back there and die to them on your next attempt.
The Evil Eye is best equipped right before the Location of the boss you're targeting. It's no use equipping it before you leave the Crossroads if you're trying to beat Chronos, for example. You're better off using something else and then switching to the Evil Eye after beating Cerberus.
Knuckle BonesKnuckle Bones
Odysseus
The next Guardian loses 5% Health. You take 15% less damage from Guardians. - Upgrade 1: 10% Guardian Health Lost.- Upgrade 2: 15% Guardian Health Lost.
The Knuckle Bones from Odysseus is another epic Keepsake for tough boss battles. The Knuckle Bones boost your defense, so you take 15% less damage from Guardians while also lowering the Guardian's HP when you start the fight. The Knuckle Bones are great for any boss fight, but combined with the Old Grudge Boon from Hades in Tartarus, you can lower Chronos's HP by 35% before you even lay a finger on him!
It's also a Keepsake that helps you out in any Location and doesn't have a limit in terms of how many bosses it helps you defeat. That means you're free to equip it and enjoy easier boss fights for your whole run without worrying about having to switch up Keepsakes in between Locations.
Lion FangLion Fang
Heracles
Deal 30% bonus damage, but lose 5% of this after each Encounter. - Upgrade 1: 40% Bonus Damage. - Upgrade 2: 50% Bonus Damage.
The Lion Fang is a brilliant Keepsake if you're looking to temporarily boost your attack, and there are many scenarios where it shines. You can use it early in your run so you can blast through Locations with ease and reach the later areas sooner and with more HP, or you could wait until Tartarus or another late-game area so your attack will be boosted when you encounter the boss of that area.
When fully upgraded, the Lion Fang starts by boosting your attack by 50% and drops it by 5% for each Encounter you complete. The fact that your attack drops after each Encounter might put you off, but it just means that you have to choose when to use it wisely. If you equip it after the Mourning Fields and before you enter Tartarus, your attack will still be boosted by the time you reach Chronos.
Silken SashSilken Sash
Arachne
Gain 20 Armor. While you have at least 1 Armor, gain 2 Armor after each Location.- Upgrade 1: Gain 3 Armor after each Location. - Upgrade 2: Gain 4 Armor after each Location.
Note: v.1.0 launch update increases Silken Sash's starting armor above what's listed above. We'll update this with the new starting armor as soon as possible! Unlike some of the other Keepsakes that are better used in smaller doses, the Silken Sash is best equipped for your entire run. Arachne's Keepsake endows you with 20x Armor at the beginning of your run and adds more Armor to that total, provided you still have some after your latest Encounter.
There is no limit to the amount of Armor the Silken Sash can give you, so while it would be difficult to make it to the late-game areas without losing it, in theory, you could potentially have a huge amount of Armor by the time you reach Chronos in Tartarus. And even if you do lose the Armor somewhere along the line, you can always switch to another Keepsake to carry you through the later stages of your run while reaping Arachne's benefits for the first part of your journey.
Silver WheelSilver Wheel
Headmistress Hecate
After you use Magick, restore it over 3 Seconds, up to a total of 1000 this night. - Upgrade 1: 1500 Magick Restoration.- Upgrade 2: 2000 Magick Restoration.
The Silver Wheel is an invaluable Keepsake for anyone who relies on their Magick as part of their play style. You can boost your Magick with Magick Bottles or get Boons that help you regenerate spent Magick by standing still, standing in your cast, or other means, but with the Silver Wheel, you can save those Boon slots for something else.
No matter what weapon you're using, your Cast and Omegas deal far more damage than your regular attacks, so having Magick always on hand will increase your damage output dramatically. If you have one of Selene's Hexes in your build, this Keepsake is even better.
Concave StoneConcave Stone
Echo
After choosing a Boon, 25% of the time randomly take one more, once this night.
The Concave Stone given to you by Echo gives you a chance of getting two Boons for the price of one. You can only use its effect once per night in its basic form, so you won't want to keep this Keepsake equipped for the entire duration of your run, but who's going to say no to a free Boon?
Boons are earned, and you have to survive
through a certain amount of danger to collect them at the end of an Encounter. The Concave Stone means you can get an extra Boon without getting a single scratch in the process. It's even better if the Boon you receive is a great one!
Olympian God KeepsakesThe Keepsakes given to you by each of the Olympian Gods all but ensure that you will encounter that God throughout your run. Everyone has their own playstyle in Hades 2. We all have our preferences for weapons, tactics, and even Boons. Getting Boons that mesh perfectly with your playstyle can make all the difference in your run, and these Keepsakes are a way to ensure that you have the best chance of creating your ideal build.
These Keepsakes are best equipped at the very beginning of your run. Hades 2 only gives you a handful of Gods to pick from in any given run. Once you've encountered the God you're looking for, the chances of encountering them again go through the roof, and you're safe to switch your Keepsake out for another one.
