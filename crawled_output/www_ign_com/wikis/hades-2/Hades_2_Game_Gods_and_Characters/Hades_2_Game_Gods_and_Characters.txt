MelinoëMelinoë is a small and slim witch with the power to wield both magic and weapons. She has a blonde bob adorned with a crescent moon and orange leaved wreath. She also has heterochromia, much like her brother's, which causes her eyes to be of different colors. Although, unlike her brother, her heterochromia is reversed, leaving her left eye red, and her right one green.
Melinoë is a stubborn and powerful witch but is very hard on herself, constantly putting herself down for being too weak. The high standards she holds herself to give her more motivation to get stronger and successfully destroy Chronos, ending the war on Olympus and avenging her family.
Melinoë's most obvious and intriguing feature is her left arm. Her left arm is translucent, revealing her skeleton underneath, and glows a bright green color. It appears that the arm could be the source of power or magic, or perhaps that she lost her own arm earlier in life and manifested a magical prosthetic, but the truth remains unclear. Both the origin and purpose of her glowing arm are unknown at this point.
Since she is a witch, her playstyle is different to that of her brother, Zagreus, who was the protagonist of the first Hades game. Her attack style is less physical and more magical, and she is able to cast long-reaching spells and casts that can trap and damage enemies.
HecateHecate is a tall, strong witch who wears a large, pointed hat with a scarf covering the bottom portion of her face. Her midriff is exposed in her outfit, showing her impressive set of abs, and she wears a billowing cloak that compliments the rest of her mysterious and mystical outfit well.
Hecate's left arm is also of interest and is covered completely by a metallic glove that reaches above the elbow, ending somewhere under her cape. It is unclear whether this is just a fashion choice or whether it is somehow connected to Melinoë's glowing left arm.
You can find Hecate behind the large Incantations cauldron in the first section of the Crossroads. Tap to RevealNemesisNemesis is a tall, broad, and powerful warrior dressed in a suit of armor with red accents and a nest of long, black hair. Her weapon of choice is a sword, and she also holds a shield inscribed with Runes on her left arm.
Nemesis is a brooding character whose jealousy over not being the one to take Melinoë's place on her mission is abundantly clear. She is often cold, calculating, and somewhat rude. Unlike Melinoë, Nemesis is confident in her power and abilities to crush Chronos.
You can find Nemesis opposite Odysseus to the right of the Incantations Cauldron in the first section of the Crossroads.
OdysseusIn Greek mythology, Odysseus was the mastermind behind the Trojan Horse. In Hades 2, he is a Veteran Tactician located in the Crossroads. Speak to Odysseus to get advice on certain bosses or foes you are struggling against. Odysseus claims to have fought them all before and identified the best way to take them down.
Odysseus wears a blue tunic with a brown, checkered layer on top. He also wears a large, rust-colored cape and carries a belt laden with scrolls containing information regarding all of the enemies he has felled and gathered intel on, no doubt.
You can find Odysseus opposite Nemesis in the Crossroads to the right of the Incantations Cauldron. He is often cheerful and cheeky, and provides helpful and uplifting advice, a stark contrast to his neighbor, Nemesis.
SchelemeusSchelemeus is a skeleton-like being who was the Training Dummy in Hades. He has since received a promotion and appears as the Training Master in Hades 2. Since Schelemeus is already dead, he makes for a perfect dummy to test out your new moves on. He is stationed conveniently beside the Silver Pool, which you will use to craft new and more advanced weapons and tools.
There is also a Mana Fountain in the training area, so you can replenish your magic after releasing it all on Schelemeus. Once you have depleted Schelemeus's HP, he will crumble and regenerate immediately, ready for another round of training.
You can find Schelemeus in the second section of the Crossroads, beside the Silver Pool and just to the left of the gate to the Underworld.
HypnosHypnos's title is Sleep Incarnate, and he embodies that role perfectly in Hades 2. The character is found sleeping in a Hammock to the right of Hecate and the Incantations Cauldron in the Crossroads for the duration of the test.
When you interact with Hypnos, a text box appears where Melinoë discusses how she will find a way to wake him from sleep. It appears Hypnos has been trapped in a sleep-like state since the events that took place in the first game, and it is your job as the player to release him from sleep's grasp at one point or another throughout the story.
DoraDora is a small, greenish ghost with long teal-colored hair and a confusing disposition. She seems to have two personalities, one being scathing and almost demonic, while the other seems friendly enough. Dora switches between these two facets of her personality rapidly and at random.
You can find Dora standing by the door in Melinoë's room just after you return from the Underworld.
CharonCharon is a tall, darkly-shrouded figure with a large brimmed hat and an oar in hand, a similar character design as he had in the first game. He also serves the same function as the local shopkeeper. You can find Charon throughout your travels in the Underworld, where he will be stationed by the banks, offering up his wares. Charon sells a rotating stock but usually carries crafting items, items to boost your health and give you a second wind in the Underworld, or Boons.
Charon doesn't offer any Boons personally to Melinoe to aid her on her adventure, but his wares can be equally as handy in certain circumstances as well.
Charon's character design, as shown in the Hades 2 test, differs from the portrait that is displayed when you speak to him. The portrait shown in the test is likely a placeholder that will be updated and changed when the game is officially released.
MorosMoros is a towering and majestic figure dressed in armor made out of skulls and a long, needle-like sword on his right side. His skin is a light grey color, and he has a long waterfall of white hair draped over a pair of antlers protruding from his head.
Moros is welcomed to the Crossroads early on in the game after Melinoë appeals to the Three Fates at the Incantations Cauldron. He comes bearing a gift in the form of the Fated List of Minor Prophecies. This serves as a mini-quest log where you are given tasks to fulfill in exchange for rewards.
You can find Moros and the Fated List of Minor Prophecies just outside the door of Melinoë's room in the Crossroads.
ApolloApollo, the God of Light, is a tall, dark character with light blonde hair and gold and red armor. He bears a bow, like his sister, Artemis, and is one of the Gods that will lend his power to Melinoë in the form of Boons that add new abilities to her moveset as she moves through the Underworld on the hunt for Chronos. All of Apollo's Boons are light-based, and his icon is a shining sun with a hole in the center.
Apollo is not present in the Crossroads, and encountering him in the Underworld is dependent on luck. There is no way to tell what Gods will be present to help you on each run until you get there.

ArtemisArtemis is a slight figure with green hair, a green dress, and fair skin. She has the pelt of one of her hunts draped around her neck and carries a green longbow. Artemis has a crescent moon circlet around her head that somewhat resembles Melinoë's, but hers features a pair of antlers, another trophy from one of her hunts.
Artemis is one of the Gods who is able to share her abilities with Melinoe to aid her on her journey throughout the Underworld. Artemis doesn't appear in the same way the other Gods do, however. Her appearance is not foretold by the unique icons the other Gods share, but rather, she appears randomly in an arena and lends her power to help you clear that room of enemies. Then she appears and offers you the choice of one of three Boons.

AphroditeAphrodite fully embodies her title as the Goddess of Love in Hades 2. She still appears wearing nothing but her conveniently placed long locks of pink hair, but this time, she also holds a large spear, making her seem far more formidable than she already did.
Aphrodite is one of the Gods who will appear in the Underworld to lend her power to Melinoë to aid her on your quest. These abilities are shared in the form of Boons. Most of Aphrodite's Boons are designed to make your opponent weaker or inflict area damage, and her icon is a pink heart.
Aphrodite is not present in the Crossroads, and encountering her in the Underworld is dependent on luck. There is no way to tell what Gods will be present to help you on each run until you get there.

ArachneArachne is a small, friendly spider that can be found in the Underworld. She is similar to the Gods that offer Boons to Melinoë to aid her in her battle, but instead of powers, Arachne offers Melinoë armor to boost her defense and offer other defensive bonuses.
Arachne is not present in the Crossroads, and encountering her in the Underworld is dependent on luck. There is no way to tell what Gods will be present to help you on each run until you get there. Her unique icon is a pair of cupped hands. When you see this on the portal to the next area, you will know to expect Arachne there.

DemeterDemeter is a stoic, older woman with long, white-blonde hair pinned around the top of her head. She has a large and heavy fur coat over her shoulders and a crown of icy wheat forming an arch over her head. She is pictured wearing a battle-ready outfit in Hades 2, which is a little different than the dress she wore in the first Hades game.
Demeter is one of the Gods who will share her power with Melinoë to help her on her journey to smite Chronos. While she is the Goddess of the Seasons, all of her Boons are frost-themed and incredibly helpful in battle, thanks to their freezing and slowing effects.

ChaosChaos, the Primordial Originator is an epic God that players of the first Hades game will be familiar with. Chaos received a new coat of paint in Hades 2 and is now pictured wearing a respectable suit with long, flowing hair pulled back into a ponytail and everyone's favorite accessory in their hand, a severed head with a fetus protruding from its mouth.
Although Chaos's look is different in Hades 2, they still serve the same function as they did in the previous game. Chaos can be found through a Chaos Gate, which you can occasionally find throughout the Underworld and Olympus. The gate costs HP to enter, and the Boons Chaos offers down there have a similar caveat. Each Boon Chaos offers is a double-edged sword that has some sort of detriment you must first suffer to later receive the benefit.
It might be the safe option to choose to avoid Chaos gates and keep your HP and whatever other negative effects their Boon may inflict upon you, but Chaos can lend a hand by supplying you with certain items required to progress further in the game, and some of the Boons are quite powerful, so visiting now and then is worthwhile.
Chaos's BoonsChaos offers the following Boons to help aid Melinoë on her journey.
