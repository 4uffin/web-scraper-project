Each Crest has a unique ability and set of Tool slots. The Crest of Wanderer is one of the earliest Crests you'll have access to, and is perfect for players who prefer the combat from the first Hollow Knight.
This guide walks you through how to get the Crest of Wanderer in Hollow Knight: Silksong, including all necessary prerequisites and its exact location.
How to Get the Wanderer Crest in Hollow Knight: SilksongBefore you can access the Wanderer Crest, or Crest of Wanderer, in Hollow Knight: Silksong, you must first complete a handful of prerequisites:
Unlock the Silkspear Skill in Mosshome. Defeat the Bell Beast in The Marrow. Unlock the Swift Step ability in Deep Docks.Silkspear UnlockedSwift Step UnlockedBell Beast DefeatedIf you need help beating the Bell Beast, head to our Bell Beast Boss Guide for tips and strategies.Buy the Simple KeyWith the Swift Step ability unlocked, you'll now be able to start hunting down the Crest of Wanderer. Start by returning to Bone Bottom and speaking to Pebb, a brown bug located to the right of the Bellways entrance. Pebb sells a Simple Key for 500 Rosaries.
If you don't have 500 Rosaries, there's a great farming spot that isn't too far away. To find it, head to the middle border of Mosshome and The Marrow, as shown in our map screenshot below:
You'll find a Bench here. Rest on it, then head left, where you'll reach a cavern filled with bugs that you can defeat for Rosaries.
Once they're all defeated, return to the Bench, rest to respawn the enemies, and rinse and repeat until you have the 500 Rosaries needed to purchase the Simple Key.
The Path to the Crest of the Wanderer (Map)Head to MosshomeWith the Simple Key in hand, you need to go to the top of Mosshome. There are two ways of doing this:
Route #1: Bone Bottom Elevator Route #2: Through the West Side of MosshomeRoute #1: Bone Bottom Elevator If you have the elevator unlocked, head right from Pebb in Bone Bottom and take it up.
From here, step off the elevator to the right and jump onto the platform on top of it.
Keep jumping up until you reach the opening for Mosshome. Jump up through it.
Route #2: Through the West Side of MosshomeIf you don't have the Bone Bottom elevator unlocked, you'll need to go through The Marrow. Remember the Rosary grind spot we mentioned earlier? Return to the bench here, and then head left.
Continue moving left through the room across the platforms until you come to a platform in the upper right. Use Hornet's Swift Step ability to cross the gap and go through to the exit to the right.
Race Through the Craggler's DenNote that once you leave the village you should save at the bench. There is a tough road ahead AND an enemy rush sequence at the end of it, so death is not unlikely. Regardless of whether you took the elevator or went through The Marrow, you'll now be at a sign with huts on it. Go right and you'll spot a dangling cage; jump to this, taking out the Aknid fly enemies as you go.
Jump onto a second cage and then onto the mossy platform on the other side. Go through the door to the right into the next area.
You'll be in a wide room with a rather nasty enemy, known as a Craggler, dangling from the ceiling.
While you can defeat it, it's better to dash through the room to the other side using Hornet's Swift Step at this point. Just be careful of the acid the Craggler spits out, as it does a lot of damage.
Go through the door at the end of the room, and you'll reach a locked door. Use the Simple Key you purchased from Pebb to unlock it and go through to the Wormways.
Fight Through the WormwaysOnce inside the Wormways, head left looking out for the dust the shows where worms are coming through the ceiling and drop down the first hole that you come across. Note that you can farm some silk on these worms if you slash them while they come down.
Follow the tunnel down and to the right, holding right as you fall to avoid spikes. Time your drops to avoid the worms. Stay right (note there's one mossy dead end) and continue down.
When you emerge right, a pilgrim snail thing will be on a ledge. Smack it and drop down. You'll be in a large, mossy chamber. Drop all the way to the bottom, landing in the water. Head RIGHT first and open the path back to the village by destroying the wall on the right side of the giant lake room. Save at the bench back in the village.
Now, head left back to the lake room and through it. You can walk on the water.
Not long after running you'll reach a hut. Go inside it and take the path going down on the right. From there, descend, but watch out for the spike trap triggered by a string at the first longer platform. Hop down to the bottom and move left.
Enemy RushAt the bottom is an enemy rush with pilgrims of several varieties, split into four waves. The final round has two of the round rollers. Remember that a Silkspear can take out most of these pilgrim enemies in one go, so if you can group them, you can kill them quickly.
After you've successfully eliminated all four waves, you'll unlock a door left. Follow it down and hook back right to reach a candlelit room. Interact with the dead bug on the table and Bind with it (hold the Bind button) to unlock the Crest of Wanderer.
