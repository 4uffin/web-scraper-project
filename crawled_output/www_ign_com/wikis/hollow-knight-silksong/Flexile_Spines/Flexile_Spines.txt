This guide teaches you how to get Spine Cores and complete the Flexile Spines side quest so you unlock the Drifter's Cloak reward, which is necessary for exploring the area, as soon as possible.
How to Start the Flexile Spines Wish in SilksongTo start the Flexile Spines Wish in Silksong, you must find and speak to the Seamstress, an NPC in the Far Fields. Completing the side quest unlocks the Drifter's Cloak, which is essential for soaring up the air currents in the area.
Once inside Far Fields, go east and you'll reach a gap with lava, a dead ant on the floor, and a Flapping Fertid enemy. Jump across the gap and go through to the next area.
There will be vertical air currents in this room. Go past the first one and drop down to the lower ledge just before the second air current. Drop down again in front of the second air current onto a small platform.
There's a platform just past the air current. Drop down onto the platform below, then jump over the gap and proceed to the next room.
In this next area, drop down right before the air current, and you'll land on a spine bridge. Continue right to reach two platforms leading up. Jump up them and go through to the next area.
You'll be in a large room with several platforms. Immediately drop down onto the small platform below and head east, taking out the enemies as you go.
Jump onto the chained platform ahead of you, then up onto the small platform, and then onto a larger one.
There will be an air current ahead of you. Jump through to the other side, and then up to the platform to the left.
There are more chained platforms to your left. Jump up them to the top, and you'll reach a large, red balloon.
Inside, you'll find the Seamstress. Speak to her to accept the Flexile Spines Wish. To complete it, you must bring her 25 Spine Cores.
Pharloom MapHow to Collect Spine Cores in SilksongFrom the Bench in the Seastress's house, head out the right side and keep an eye out for Hokers. Take note of the spines poking out of them. When you hit them, they will shoot their spines straight out. Hitting the spine projectiles midair or hitting the spines stuck in the terrain drops a Spine Core.
Spines that hit you can not be collected. Spines can travel quite a distance, so make sure you track as many as can when they fire. Gather as many as you can off each hit to minimize the number of times you need to leave and reenter the area.
Once you have 25 Spine Cores, return to the Seamstress with your haul. This will complete the Flexile Spines Wish, and as a reward, you'll unlock the
Drifter's Cloak. This gives you the ability to glide when airborne, travel upwind in air currents to explore new areas, or slow your fall over dangerous terrain.
