These collectible critters will reward you the more of them you find.
Instead of Grubs, this time you'll need to find 30 Lost Fleas to bring back to the Fleamaster's traveling caravan as part of The Lost Fleas Wish Sidequest. For every 5 Lost Fleas you locate in the world (heard by their dog-like whines and barks), you'll earn a new reward. Lost Fleas are often found in very hidden or out-of-the-way spots that may require certain abilities that you may not have on first arrival.
Where to Begin the Lost Flea QuestUpon first entering The Marrow region past the town of Bone Bottom, travel all the way right to a large, lava-filled room, and climb up to the top right side. In the room above, you can find a sign with the symbol of a shaggy Flea pointing to the left where the Caravan is located. Speaking to Fleamaster Mooshka will begin The Lost Fleas Wish to track them down, 5 at a time. Click or tap here to jump to the rewards for finding fleas.
To see the locations of each Lost Flea, see our list below:
Lost Fleas Map and By RegionNote that while there may be many lost fleas in earlier regions, you won't be able to rescue some until you've unlocked specific skills.

Pharloom MapDetailed guides on where to find every flea are coming soon. For now, you can check out the ones we have prepared below.The Marrow Lost FleasThere is only 1 Lost Flea in The Marrow region of Pharloom.
Required Abilities: NoneThis flea can be found after defeating the Bell Beast in the Marrow. From the Bell Beast's arena, head to the right until you pass the room with the bench and bell. In this next room, head to the right side and climb the platforms up until they lead you out of the room.
At this point you should be in the room pictured below, a large area filled with spikes and crumbling platforms.
Head left, carefully making your way across the platforms until you reach the left side of the room, then double back, climbing the platforms until you reach the top of the room.
Now you'll need to head to the right and, looking down, jump to the crumbling platform below, then jump to the right, where you'll find a Flea trapped by some brambles. Attack them to free the creature and add progress to your quest.
The Marrow Lost Flea 1Deep Docks Lost FleasThere are 3 Lost Fleas in the Deep Docks region.
Deep Docks Lost Flea 1 Required Skills: NoneGetting to this Flea is rather direct, it's just a matter of knowing where to look. To begin, enter the Deep Docks from The Marrow.
From here, head to the right, past the bench room, continuing until you reach the tall room with platforms leading up and down. Jump down one platform, then turn left and enter the door below.
Follow this next room down to the Bellway station, but instead of summoning the Bell Beast, attack the wall on the far left, revealing a passage.
In this next room, you'll need to carefully time your jumps to avoid getting hit by the lava.
Head all the way to the left, then follow the platforms up and to the right.
You'll find the Flea on a platform above the entrance. To safely reach the entrance, attack the right side of the Flea's platform to create a small shortcut to the room's entrance.
Deep Docks Lost Flea 1Deep Docks Lost Flea 2 Required Skill: Swift StepThis Flea can be found in the same room where you will acquire the Swift Step Weaver's Skill during the main story.
This can be found by traveling upward through the Deep Docks, dipping up into the Hunter's March area and back down to the long room where you can get the skill.
After getting the Dash, test it out by by holding down RT/R2 and vaulting along the high platforms heading left from the Weaver altar. This will lead to a final ledge with a lever. Attack the lever to drop a large platform from above.
With the lowered platform, you can now use your dashing jump to vault from the new platform up to the higher ledge on the left. Remember that you can use the Swift Step to dash a short distance in the air as well, which you can while jumping to the upper right platform. Here you'll find the Lost Flea trapped in a cocoon you can break open.
Deep Docks Lost Flea 2Deep Docks Lost Flea 3This flea location is coming soon!
Hunter's March Lost FleasThere is only 1 Lost Flea in The Hunter's March region of Pharloom.
Hunter's March Lost Flea 1
Required Skill: Swift Step (Recommended)You can find this Lost Flea in the optional region of Hunter's March, which has an entrance on the upper right side of the Marrow. Start from the bench located in the prison room (where you can find Grindle), and look for a pathway directly above leading right.
Note that to enter the Hunter's March, you'll need to defeat a very imposing Skull Ant miniboss who can be extremely tough if fought early. For that reason, we recommend getting the Swift Step upgrade in the Deep Docks first.
When the great enemy is defeated, head to the right into the region proper, and you'll find a tall room full of red spikes and the red pincushion platforms you can bounce off of by performing a downward dive attack.
Once you get past the second set of red objects to a landing, the path to the right will take you further into Hunter's March, but you should aim to dive attack and bounce directly upward instead. Take out the flying enemies before moving on, and carefully bounce between a rising group of pincushions to reach a ledge on the upper right side where the Lost Flea has been caged.
Hunter's March Lost FleaGreymoor Lost FleasThere are three fleas to rescue in the dreary Greymoor. As always, you can rescue them in any order but we've numbered them for tracking purposes.
Greymoor Lost Flea 1Required Skills: Wall Cling
The best bench for this one is in Greymoor's Halfway Home if you don't have any other benches unlocked in Greymoor. While you can technically get through this without Wall Cling, we recommend having it to make general traversal and a runback in this section faster. If you've already beaten Tap to Revealthen you can skip most of the steps for this one.
From the Far Fields emergence point in Greymoor, go right through the first door and down into a room with Shakra's camp. Continue right, floating up and dropping down the ledge. You'll need to swim past the gap here and continue right. If you haven't faced the bird enemies yet (the Craw), I recommend doing so now by slaying the two Craw in this room and the few you encounter on your way to your true location: Craw Lake. When you're ready, continue on right.
You've reached Craw Lake, a very vertical side area that requires you to take on a challenge in the building in the middle of the lake before you can explore much more. On your way over, two Craw will try to attack you. The gate to the building is shut on the first floor. You can use the ledges to jump up to the second floor and take on another Craw enemy, the Tallcraw, or you can swim right under the building and hop up to the platform to unlock the gate. Again, if you haven't faced many Craw yet, I recommend practicing fighting the Tallcraw.
When you're ready, enter the building. If you're not the most confident in your new encounter skills, I'd say leave the hanging rosary for now as you see them in this building, especially since there's a decent number to collect here! Once you drop down, you'll either leave successful or dead. That being said, drop down, keeping left. This will allow you to land on a spot that's a tad higher up than the two small enemies patrolling the ground. At the bottom of this large room are two Mites. You can ignore them or slay them to build Silk.
When you're ready, climb up the platforms along the right side of the room. At the top, you'll spot what you're really here for: an arena battle. Walk forward and the gate closes, leaving you to face these four waves:
Round 1: 1 Craw and 1 Squatcraw Round 2: 2 Craw Round 3: 1 Craw and 1 Tallcraw Round 4: 3 Craw Round 5: 1 Squatcraw and 1 TallcrawWhen you've successfully completed the challenge, a ball emerges that you'll need to use to access the next room above. There, hit the switch and something loud happens (spoilers, Craw Lake has changed)! Now you can leave the way you came, collecting any rosary you missed by using the balloons on chains that appear in the building.
Now you can get to work on saving the flea here. Hop to the top of the building, eliminating the Squatcraw that's now on the roof. All around you are balloons on chains that are the perfect aid for ascending this vertical room. You'll have to use the ones on the left side of the building first, then hop to the large one on the right side of the chain. This large one is near a ledge you'll need to glide to.
Once you're on the ledge, face off against the Tallcraw! Then, drop down the gap on the right against the wall and slay the Mite at the bottom.
Be careful not to hit the lever, and if you do, don't fall down! This lever doesn't stay fixed in the open position, so it'll close the door automatically after a few seconds. Now you can hop up and free the flea by hitting its confines. You can leave this side spot by using the lever to drop down.
Greymoor Lost Flea 1More flea locations coming soon.Shellwood Lost FleaThere's only one flea to find in Shellwood, and you'll likely hear its cries on your journey through the thorny area.
This page is currently in progress, please check back later for more updates.Rewards for Finding Lost FleasAfter you find the requested number of fleas, return to Fleamaster Mooshka for a reward. Here are the ones we've seen so far:
First 5 Fleas Reward: The flea caravan moves to the long, low passage in Greymoor and invite you to join them. If you haven't fought the Moorwing yet, they'll effectively take its place, allowing you to skip the fight! Once they settle in their camp, speak with the flea at the pot to receive a new Tool as a reward, Flea Brew. It temporarily increases your attack speed and movement.
