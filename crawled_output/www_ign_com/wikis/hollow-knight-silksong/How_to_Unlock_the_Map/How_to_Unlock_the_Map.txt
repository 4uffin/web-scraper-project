Luckily, Hornet will be able to unlock an ever-expanding map early on in her adventure, but it won't be right away. Below you'll find out how you can unlock the Map in Silksong, and also how to expand it.
Where to Find the Map MerchantLike Hollow Knight, Silksong's map isn't something you start the game with, which can make exploration confusing at first. Luckily, the early path is fairly linear, and unlocking the map is essentially along the main path, so you need only continue your journey.
After defeating your first boss in the Moss Grotto and passing through the town of Bone Bottom, you'll enter Pharloom's second region: The Marrow. Upon reaching the large lava-filled room, start traveling upwards and to the left, and all the way up a shaft room full of crumbling ledges that reform after a moment.
Once at the top of the shaft, head through the left passage, and keep moving left until you hear the sound of someone singing. You'll know you're close when you start encountering lots of bug corpses and copper rings.
Nearby, you'll meet a merchant named Shakra—a warrior monk who is also a skilled cartographer. She'll offer to sell you maps in exchange for Rosary Beads, along with several map-related supplies:
Item Sold (Price)
Description
Mosslands Map (40 Rosary Beads)
Unlocks a central map of Moss Grotto.
The Marrow Map (50 Rosary Beads)
Unlocks a central map of The Marrow.
Quill (50 Rosary Beads)
Allows Hornet to automatically update and existing purchased map with new areas you've discovered (when resting at a bench).
Compass (70 Rosary Beads)
A Yellow Tool that can track your location on a purchased map when viewing it by holding LB/L1
Bench Pins (60 Rosary Beads)
Automatically adds pins to each Bench or Rest Spot you've located in a purchased map.
Shell Marker (40 Rosary Beads)
Adds 9 custom markers that can be manually placed when viewing your map while resting on a bench.
Shakra will be found throughout the regions of Pharloom, and will sell you maps of the different regions you encounter. It's important to note that even if you purchase a Quill, you can't add to a map you haven't purchased yet, so prioritize buying the actual maps before getting the Quill to keep expanding on a region you have the map for.
Once you've purchased the map of an area, you'll be able to view it both when sitting at a bench, and also open up the map while moving around in the world by holding L1/LB for the region you're in. Just remember that any areas not filled in on the purchased map will be added by Hornet once you sit at a bench to rest.
If you still find yourself getting lost even with a map, be sure to also purchase and equip the Compass, which is a Yellow Tool that can be added to your Crest when sitting at a bench.
How to Get Rosary Beads to Buy MapsAll of Shakra's wares cost Rosary Beads to purchase, which you likely don't have enough of in your first encounter to buy more than 1 or 2 things. Luckily, there are plentiful ways to find more.
Rosary Beads are small red or silver-colored beads that can be found in a few distinct ways. One is by finding them stashed in the world - some can be found hanging from ceiling, or draped over statues, or buried in mounds hidden away. Simply attack them to dislodge the beads and then walk around to collect them off the floor.
The second way is by defeating enemies that carry Rosary Beads. Unlike the first Hollow Knight game, where all enemies dropped one type of currency, the more beast-like enemies in Pharloom only drop Shell Shards. Instead, you'll need to seek out aggressive "humanoid" enemies to find Rosary Beads.
As luck would have it, there's a room just to the left of Shakra leading back into Moss Grotto where several pilgrim bugs seem to have lost their minds and will attack you on sight. Defeat them to earn Rosary Beads while you make your way up to the top right of the room. When it doubles back to the area Shakra is in, you'll find a bench and a shortcut back. Rest at the bench and return to the room to find the corrupted pilgrims respawned, and keep defeating them until you can buy all of Shakra's wares here!
If you move on without buying everything from Shakra, you can always return to Bone Bottom to find her selling wares in town! Or, if she isn't there, strike the rings in her usual spot to summon her.Up Next: How to Get Rosary BeadsPreviousHow to GuidesNextHow to Get Rosary BeadsTop Guide SectionsDifferences and New FeaturesEssential Tips and TricksWalkthroughBoss GuidesWas this guide helpful?Leave feedbackIn This GuideHollow Knight: SilksongTeam CherrySep 4, 2025+3Learn moreGo to commentsReviews•Editor Columns•News•Guides•Upcoming Sales Events•How to Watch Guides•Board Game Reviews•GTA 5 Cheats•Best Streaming Bundles•IGN Store•Top Deals•Contact Us•IGN YouTube•HowLongToBeat•IGN TikTok•IGN Twitter•Map Genie•Eurogamer•Rock Paper Shotgun•VG247•Maxroll•Privacy Policy•Terms of Use
