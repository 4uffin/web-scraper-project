You haven't spent all those Rosaries for nothing, though; there's a way to get it up and running again. This guide walks you through how to fix the Sinner's Road Bench in Silksong.
How to Find the Sinner's Road Bench and Map in SilksongThe first Sinner's Road Bench is located in the western section of Sinner's Road in Silksong. To find it, start at the Graymoor entrance, as shown in our map screenshot below:
Once inside Sinner's Road, head right through the room, taking out the Muckroach enemies as you go. Jump on top of the cage at the end of the room and then up onto the platform and through to the next room.
Walk forward and you'll come to a hanging Bench signpost. Note where the sign is hanging from; you can wall-jump here.
Wall jump up and you'll reach a platform with some hanging cages above it. Use these cages to wall jump up further.
Once you reach the top of the cages, head left, and you'll come to another hanging cage. Wall jump on top of it.
From the cage, jump up to the platform on the left and head through the door to the next room.
In this room, you'll see a swinging pendulum in front of you. Wait until it's close to you, then jump above it and pogo onto it to reach the other side.
You'll find a Bench mechanism here, which you need to pay 60 Rosaries to unlock. Interact with it and pay and... nothing happens. Something's stopping the Bench from activating, and you need to fix it to be able to rest at the Bench.
Shakra, the map seller, is to the left of the Bench and sells the Sinner's Road map for 90 Rosaries.Pharloom MapHow to Fix the Sinner's Road Bench in SilksongTo fix the Sinner's Road Bench in Silksong, you need to break through to a secret room and navigate through a series of traps to free the Bench's mechanism from some vines. Start by climbing up the wall to the left of the Bench.
Once you reach the top, attack the rocky section of the wall here. The wall will break, revealing a hidden passage.
Continue left and you'll come across two swinging traps. Pogo on the first, longer one once it reaches you, then onto the shorter one, and glide onto the platform on the other side.
You'll reach two more swinging pendulums. Like before, wait for the first one to get close, pogo onto it, glide and pogo onto the second one, and land on the platform on the other side.
Next, you'll come to a downward section with more swinging pendulums. You can either wall jump or glide down to the bottom - we prefer gliding, but either way works. Just make sure to avoid hitting the pendulums and spike-lined walls on your way down.
Once you land on the platform at the bottom, break the spools of thread to the left to fill up your Silk gauge a reasonable amount and heal up if you need to.
At the bottom, go right, and you'll encounter another set of pendulums you'll need to pogo onto. Do so, and land on the small platform, where you'll see even more pendulums ahead of you.
There are four pendulums here: two swinging ones, one stationary one, and another swinging one. Bounce onto the longer pendulum and glide over to the stationary one, skipping the second altogether. From here, pogo onto the final swinging pendulum and onto the platform on the other side.
Walk right once you're on the platform, and you'll come to a pool of poison water, infested with maggots. Yuck! Unfortunately, you've got no choice but to swim in it. You'll become poisoned, but you won't take damage - instead, the maggots will eat away at your Silk gauge, and the only way to cure yourself is to Bind and heal. So you'll want to do this before your Silk is fully depleted.
Swim over to the platform on the other side, where you'll find the Bench mechanism tangled up in vines. Attack the vines to destroy them and fix the Sinner's Road Bench.
Now that you've freed the mechanism from the vines and got the Bench working again, you'll need to make your way back. Luckily, there's a shortcut that you can take. Look to the left, and you'll see a section of wall you can use to wall jump up. Do so.
At the top, follow the path left and you'll come to another section of wall you can wall jump on.
At the top of here, you'll need to attack to break the ceiling. Do so, and you'll come out next to the first set of swinging pendulums you crossed over earlier.
Glide over the two swinging pendulums to the right (you don't need to bounce on them this time since you're on a higher platform), and then drop down back to the Bench, which you'll now find is fixed. Yay!
