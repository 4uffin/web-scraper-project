The Last Judge is an incredibly strong foe with imposing stature and the ability to explode the very air with waves of fire, making it a formidable guardian.
How to Reach The Last JudgeThe Last Judge resides at the very top of the Blasted Steps, and area far above the Moss Grotto that can be reached by crossing the bridge from Shellwood, once you have acquired the Cling Grip from that region. You'll need it to wall-jump up the treacherous landscape and avoid the pits of vicious worms on your ascent.
Once you reach the very top of the region, you'll be met with an imposing door that two pilgrims are praying at. They will inform you that no key can open the door, instead only the "holy bells" upon the path open the way.
This remark is referencing the large bells you may have encountered along your trek, each of them often requiring you to pull a lever and unlock a path forward after the giant bell tolls. There are five bells in total (most required to progress), and can be found in The Marrow, Deep Docks, Shellwood, Bellhart, and Greymoor.
With all bells rung, the last step is to play music, which Hornet can do with the Needolin ability from defeating the Widow holding the town of Bellhart in thrall. Once you do, the Last Judge will be roused from its slumber and leap into the arena.
If you're having too much difficulty or just want to try something different, you can find a secret alternate path to The Citadel by way of the Exhaust Organ above Greymoor and the Sinner's Road. To reach it, you'll need to traverse a maze called The Mist. This allows you to skip the Last Judge (or fight them later once you're more powerful).The Last Judge Boss Guide Recommended Crest: Reaper or Wanderer Recommended Tools: Curveclaw/Straight Pin, Flea Brew, Magma Bell, Magnetite Dice, Fractured SkullThe Last Judge is a truly powerful opponent, able to deal a lot of damage, move fast, and offers little time to react with attacks that can hit at almost any range. Be sure you're adequately prepared by upgrading your Needle at the shop in Bellhart, and finding at least four Mask Shards to get yourself an extra health point.
Above all else, the Last Judge will be a true test of your movement ability and to adapt to attacks at different ranges, plus knowing when (and when not to) get close for your own attacks. Many of their attacks also encompass wide areas, and can make this more of a platforming test than all-out combat. Keeping calm and focusing on your own evasion first is key, and as you learn their attack patterns, you'll be able to better understand when it's safe to strike back.
The Last Judge will begin the fight (at least during your first attempt) by throwing her flail-like censer with an overhand toss with a surprising amount of range that can be difficult to judge. The good news is that since it comes in high, you can sprint close and unleash a dash attack or two.
However, after tossing the censer, she will always yank it back along the ground in an attempt to trap you and damage you as it comes back low. After getting 2-3 hits in, be ready to jump upwards and back as the weapon zips back into her hand.
Her other censer attack looks very similar to her toss at first glance, and it can be difficult to judge whether to rush in or stay back. If she holds it steady behind her, she's going for a toss. But if she starts to spin it, immediately dash backward out of melee range, as she'll spin the censer rapidly to cover an area all around her that can hurt, and can even deflect tools and traps.
Her last main attack in this first phase has two variants of a leaping strike, which can only be identified when she bends down slightly while holding her usual pose. Most times, she'll leap high into the air, pause for a moment, then slam down just a few paces away with her weapon. The pause should give you plenty of time to either back up, or dash under her and then dash back to strike when she lands, as it will take her a moment to get back up and move to her next attack.
A trickier variant can happen much faster, usually if you've been fighting on one side of the arena. She'll perform the leap but always move to the center of the room without pausing to slam down, which can still damage you if you are expecting that moment of grace. Because of this, you'll just need to remember your spacing and stay out of the exact center when she starts a leap -- just in case.
The good news is that aside from twirling her censer weapon, she's quite vulnerable at range, and you can use the Curveclaw tool to deal a great amount of damage at medium range as it hits multiple times, or the Straight Pin while staying out of range of her weapon toss. If you're feeling gutsy, use Flea Brew during the first phase to get in and strike quickly while her moves are more limited.
Once she's been stunned at least once and taken a good amount of damage, she'll soon ignite her censer, starting the second phase. Things will get a lot more chaotic at this point, requiring a lot more mobility on your part. Failure to predict her new fire-based attacks will have you taking double damage, but you can mitigate this with the Magma Bell Tool sold in the Deep Docks.
The Last Judge will always start the second phase by spinning her fiery censer causing a wall of flame. To make matters worse, you'll begin to see outer rings of smoke drift toward you, which will also ignite into flame after a few seconds. They are evenly spaced, so watch the smoke closely and don't dash around -- using the opportunity to toss more projectiles her way.
Her censer toss attack also gets an upgrade, as the weapon will now cause a delayed explosion after it slams into the ground. If you are dashing out of the range, don't try dashing back in or the explosion will hit you, and instead toss traps. If you dash under the toss, stay close to her and jump right after the explosion to avoid it coming back.
The jumping slam attack has a similar fiery bonus, but rather annoyingly it won't always trigger, so you'll either need to react quickly or play it safe and assume the worst for each jump. At the height of her jump, she'll ignite the censer before slamming into the ground. You'll have the briefest of moments to spot the wave of smoke rising up along the ground when she slams down before the smoke ignites into flames, covering all the ground.
The best counter for this is to simply jump up as she lands, and extend your Drifter's Cloak to slowfall for a moment, or try a downward strike to "pogo" off her to increase your airtime.
Finally, she'll have a new attack often performed at mid distance. She'll crouch down and raise up her weapon behind her, engulfed in fire for a moment before dashing forward. The distance covered is usually pretty considerable, always past you as she drags the censer along the ground.
In her wake, several columns of smoke will appear, and will ignite after a brief moment. This means just dodging her charge isn't enough, you'll need to also reposition yourself quickly to avoid taking fire damage. The good news is since the Last Judge lunges low to the ground, you'll have a great opportunity to slash downward as she passes under you. Don't worry about trying to stay close and counter after her dash as the fire plumes are almost always too close to her and negate melee range, so toss some projectiles instead.
Her dash is also a great time to heal if you need it, the moment you spot the plumes of smoke, jump in between them and Bind and you should be healed by the time the fire dissipates. Otherwise, try to bait out her weapon toss and stay far away from the weapon and you'll have time to heal.
When she gets into a final more murderous phase, she'll perform an extended fiery censer spin. Keep your distance, and be ready to alternate stepping away from the rings of smoke that will burst into flames at least four times in succession.
One the flames dissipate, she'll be momentarily winded and give you an opening, but get your hits in quickly until she stands back up, then retreat before she spins her censer again.
She'll only do the extended attack once before returning to her usual moves, and you should play this as defensive as you can. Always reset to standing out of range of her spinning attack so you can adapt to either moving away from the rings of fire, jumping over her dash, moving under her weapon toss, or dodging and jumping up when she slams down. If you're having trouble finding openings, there's no shame in waiting for a specific attack you know how to counter, like slashing down when she dashes, or getting off a slash after floating over the wave of fire following her jump attack. Once you've gotten the evasion part down and can reliably avoid most attacks, you can chip away at her at your leisure.
When she finally falls to the ground, her censer will begin to emit a large amount of smoke as she recites one final chant. This would be a good time to back away, as she'll have one last explosive laugh if you're standing too close!
