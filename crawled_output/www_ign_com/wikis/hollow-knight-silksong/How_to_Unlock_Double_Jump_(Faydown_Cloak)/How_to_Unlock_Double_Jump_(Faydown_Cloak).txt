It allows Hornet to perform a double jump, similar to the monarch wings in the original Hollow Knight. It is located at the top of Mount Fey (to the left of The Slab) and requires the Clawline Ancestral Art to obtain.
If you haven't already got the Clawline, start off by either heading to the stage area of Choral Chambers and defeating Trobbio, or get the white key from Songclave (top right of citadel) and go through Whiteward. Then make your way through the east side of the underworks, and grab Clawline from the left side of "The Cauldron".
Fighting Trobbio is theoretically faster, but double jump is very handy for boss fights - grab it first if you're struggling with him
How to Get the Faydown Cloak in Hollow Knight: Silksong
Ascending Mount Fey involves fast-paced platforming to avoid succumbing to the harsh cold.
To climb Mount Fay, you must have already acquired the Clawline Ancestral Art. This allows you to grapple floating discs reachable from the left side of the Bell Beast station in the slab.
In order to climb up Mount Fay, you must quickly move between the safe areas. The glowing lights or fires provide shelter from the cold. Once you leave these safe zones, you have 15 seconds to make it to the next one or you'll start taking damage from the cold.
If you make a mistake while climbing, go back to the previous safe spot. It is safer to go back and reset your 15 second "cold" timer.Up Next: How to Unlock Wall Jump (Cling Grip)PreviousHow to Get Rosary BeadsNextHow to Unlock Wall Jump (Cling Grip)Top Guide SectionsDifferences and New FeaturesEssential Tips and TricksWalkthroughBoss GuidesWas this guide helpful?Leave feedbackIn This GuideHollow Knight: SilksongTeam CherrySep 4, 2025+3Learn moreGo to commentsReviews•Editor Columns•News•Guides•Upcoming Sales Events•How to Watch Guides•Board Game Reviews•GTA 5 Cheats•Best Streaming Bundles•IGN Store•Top Deals•Contact Us•IGN YouTube•HowLongToBeat•IGN TikTok•IGN Twitter•Map Genie•Eurogamer•Rock Paper Shotgun•VG247•Maxroll•Privacy Policy•Terms of Use
