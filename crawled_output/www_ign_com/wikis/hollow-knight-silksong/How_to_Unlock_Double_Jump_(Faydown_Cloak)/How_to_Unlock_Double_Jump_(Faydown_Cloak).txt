It allows Hornet to perform a double jump, similar to the monarch wings in the original Hollow Knight. It is located at the top of Mount Fey (to the left of The Slab) and requires the Clawline Ancestral Art to obtain.
If you haven't already got the Clawline, start off by either heading to the stage area of Choral Chambers and defeating Trobbio, or get the white key from Songclave (top right of citadel) and go through Whiteward. Then make your way through the east side of the underworks, and grab Clawline from the left side of "The Cauldron".
Fighting Trobbio is theoretically faster, but double jump is very handy for boss fights - grab it first if you're struggling with him
How to Get the Faydown Cloak in Hollow Knight: SilksongAscending Mount Fey involves fast-paced platforming to avoid succumbing to the harsh cold.To climb Mount Fay, you must have already acquired the Clawline Ancestral Art. This allows you to grapple floating rings reachable from the left side of the Bell Beast station in the slab.
In order to climb up Mount Fay, you must quickly move between the safe areas. The glowing lights or fires provide shelter from the cold. Once you leave these safe zones, you have 15 seconds to make it to the next one or you'll start taking damage from the cold.
If you make a mistake while climbing, go back to the previous safe spot. It is safer to go back and reset your 15 second "cold" timer.Mount Fay is a large place, and although it's a bit linear at first, it can be hard to know where to go with a limited amount of time to decide where to climb next. For the quickest route, you can see the walkthrough below:
Start by using the Clawline to zip across the first pit using the two rings, and sprint left into the cave.
Once inside the cave, you'll find Shakra at a safe spot with a warm flame. Be sure to buy the Mount Fay map from her before moving on.
To the left of Shakra, take a running leap above the icy water and climb up the small platforms and then back to the right on a landing above Shakra. It's full of ancient Weavelights that provide warmth from the cold, and you can double back to the right to leave the cave.
Back outside, take a running leap to a wall on the right and climb up the crumbling platforms. Once you reach a stable platform, look a floating creature to the right you can Clawline off to reach a ring higher up, then wall-jump up the left.
Keep climbing up this area quickly to reach another heated safe spot above.
Don't worry too much about missing jumps off of flying bugs, as they will always reappear after several moments. Just retreat to the last heat source, and then try again!Once you catch your breath, continue wall-climbing up the left wall and then slowfall to the right over the spikes and downwards. Be sure to hug the left wall after gliding down to find another heated spot to jump off from.
From the safe wall spot, jump right and upwards to find a landing, and look to the right for a series of flying bugs. Clawline across them to a platform on the right and then back to the left to gain some height.
At the top, you'll finally be able to reach a large ledge with another warm spot leading back into a cave.
Inside the cave tunnel, strike the threads to gain some Silk back if you need to heal up, and stop at the edge of a huge drop. You'll need to carefully fall down avoiding the crystal bugs and their explosions. Use your slowfall while keeping to the left to find a ledge with a heat source to land at, and continue into another passageway.
Watch out for a weavenest enemy here that shoots blasts, and move past it to the far left wall. Strike at it repeatedly to open up another pathway.
The next room features a large icy lake you'll want to avoid falling in. Use your Clawline to bounce off the crystal bugs until you find a ring above you. Clawline to the bug on the left and use the height to reach the ring, and then climb up to the ledge above to heat up.
Dash to the left and slowfall down until you spot a large rock in the ceiling. Cling to one side of it until falls down to create a platform, and use it to Clawline to the ring on the left and over to another safe spot. Repeat this again to reach the door on the far left side of the lake.
You'll be in a heated room, with a bench just below. The way forward is up, but we recommend quickly going left, dropping down outside, and attacking the wall below to tunnel back to where the bench is to save your progress.
Head upwards from the bench room to a large area with a broken cable car slope. Make sure to rest up by the torch on the left before climbing up and onto the first car. Clawline to the flying bug on the right and up onto the second car.
Use the ring and two flying bugs nearby to gain enough height to reach the third car, and keep moving to the right and upwards to reach the fourth car. Do so quickly, and as soon as you reach the fourth car, jump up to the left onto a wall with a heat spot to rest at.
From the heated wall, keep wall-jumping straight up around the spikes, and then dash and Clawline over to the far right wall to avoid more spikes above and below. Slowly slide down the right wall, and as soon as you drop down, slowfall to the right to clawline a series of flying bugs until you reach a large plateau.
Ignore the bugs and cable cars above, and dash right to find a heated spot by a cave entrance you can head inside.
In the cave, carefully drop and slowfall down the icy pit, and look for a wall space you can slide down at the end to hit a heated spot.
From here, jump right and clawline across the crystal bugs until you reach a crumbling wall section, and bounce off it to zip between more bugs going left, right, and up to a n icy wall you can bounce off to reach a high ledge.
The next area has another long lake section, and you'll need to keep bouncing off crystal bugs to stay out of the water, and cling to the jutting ceilings so that platforms fall down below. Once you reach the far side, stock up on Silk to heal if needed before you dash right.
You'll now be above the giant pit you had to fall down earlier, only this time you can jump right to a high pathway going over an area you went through earlier, heading right until you go back outside. Break the rocks as you exit to create a shortcut.
You'll need to do more climbing once outside, so start by dashing right and jumping to clawline off a flying bug and up to a series of rings leading up to the right. Clawline between two more bugs to reach a ring upward back to the left, and wall-jump up to a landing above.
On this plateau, it looks like you've reached a dead-end, but you can attack the wall to the left where some debris has piled up to open up a heated area with a bench to save at.
At the mouth of the cave you just opened, wall-jump off the wall above to reach a ring with your clawline, and alternate jumping off the left wall with using the clawline to gain more height from rings and flying bugs, until you can find another section of wall to climb upward.
Keep wall-jumping up to find a heated spot to stop for a moment, and then jump right and slowfall over the spikes. As you fall down the other side, be ready to clawline right to a flying bug, and then quickly across a series of small crumbling platforms to reach the top left wall, and wall-jump upwards.
Grab some silk stuck to the flowers if you need to, and keep jumping left, leaping over gaps to hit the far left wall where another heated spot is.
From here, wall-jump up and clawline into the flying bugs above, before wall-jumping off the floating crumbling walls on the right to double back across. Repeat this process until you can wall-jump up a narrow opening to a heated spot, and a place to jump upwards.
From here, you only need to wall-jump up and out of a shaft, and then slowfall float down and to left over some spikes to reach a large air vent. Riding this vent will take you all the way to the peak!
Once you've finally reached your goal, look for the giant tuning fork at the peak of Mount Fay, and play your Needolin. A giant winged creature will appear, but rather than fight, it will bestow upon you the Faydown Cloak!
With the Faydown Cloak, you not only gain the ability to perform a double jump, but you'll also be protected from the cold of Mount Fay, and can now explore the rest of this region without having to run between heat sources!
