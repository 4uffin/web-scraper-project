Here are the current known details about Ash & Iron's new Exotics.
New MalpaisNew Malpais is a part of the "Rocket Pulse" Frame that released with Edge of Fate; however, compared to Mint Retrograde, New Malpais fires at 320RPM rather than 200RPM. Here are the traits and catalyst's descriptions:
Intrinsic- Atomoizing Rounds: Rounds fired embed themselves in targets. Press (reload) to detonate embedded rounds. Exotic Perk- Suspending Blast: Detonating a large number of rounds embedded in a single target suspends them. Exotic Catalyst- Unraveling Blast: This weapon's explosions unravel nearby targets.For the Suspending Blast perk, it takes two full bursts to explode at once to activate the perk. Make sure to manually detonate your shots once you fire two bursts if you want to suspend a target.To get New Malpais, you can either reach rank 70 on the free season pass or purchase the pass and get it at rank 1. WolfsbaneWolfsbane is a rather unique sword and comes with a number of unique catalysts, allowing you to spec the weapon however you'd like. Here are the base exotic perks, and then a list of the catalysts:
Exotic Intrinsic- Resurgence Directive: Light attacks generate sword energy and have the chance to spawn seeking Quicksilver nanites that heal the wielder upon attaching. Exotic Perk- Nano-Assault: Quicksilver nanites that attach to the wielder charge the blade. [Alternate Weapon Action] When fully charged to overclock the attached nanites, enhancing the blade's offensive capabilities. Light attacks deal increased damage to targets; fully charged Heavy attacks create a flaming Quicksilver swarm-nado. Catalyst- Attrition Orbs: Dealing sustained damage creates an Orb of Power Catalyst- Relentless Strikes: Landing three light-attack hits within a short time grants Sword ammo Catalyst- Burning Ambition: Dealing sustained damage scorches the target. Dealing damage to a scorched target inflicts scorch. Catalyst- Subroutine: ~Recursion: Quicksilver nanites grant more health the greater your stacks of Nano-Assault are. Taking damage while Nano-Assault is active has the chance to generate nanites nearby.To obtain Wolfsbane, you'll have to complete the Warsat Heist Exotic Mission, releasing on October 7th.
