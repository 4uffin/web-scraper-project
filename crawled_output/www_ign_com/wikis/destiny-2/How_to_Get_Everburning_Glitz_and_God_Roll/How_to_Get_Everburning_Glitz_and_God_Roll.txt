Auto Rifles aren't usually dominant in the Destiny 2 meta, but Everburning Glitz can roll with some solid perks that make it a surprisingly strong gun. Here's how to get Everburning Glitz (and its god roll) in Destiny 2.
How to Get Everburning GlitzEverburning Glitz is a Trials of Osiris reward in Destiny 2. Just keep farming Trials matches and you'll eventually get one. Sometimes, it'll even be listed as a guaranteed bonus drop in the Portal whenever you select Trials of Osiris.
Everburning Glitz is unique because it features two new perks. Bewildering Burst launches a Kinetic projectile that detonates into a disorienting blast when you reload after a kill, and Ancillary Ordinance creates homing missiles after rapid final blows on enemies affected by elemental debuffs.

Extended Barrel Ricochet Rounds Dynamic Sway Reduction Zen Moment Roar of Battle Range MasterworkThese perks make Everburning Glitz a highly-accurate laser beam that can dominate the Crucible and Trials. These perks are typically sought-after for PVP Auto Rifle rolls, so it makes sense that they'd benefit Everburning Glitz as well.
Everburning Glitz PVE God RollThis is the best PVE god roll for Everburning Glitz in Destiny 2.
Fluted Barrel Flared Magwell Bewildering Burst Kinetic Tremors Roar of Battle Reload Speed MasterworkThis perk set maximizes Everburning Glitz's handling and reload speed so you can stay in the fight longer. Plus, Kinetic Tremors paired with the new Bewildering Burst perk will help you clear large groups with ease.
You can also swap Kinetic Tremors out for Ancillary Ordinance if you're running debuff builds with certain subclasses. Those homing missiles can really amp up your damage output, and if you're already going to be scorching, jolting, unraveling, or anything else, there's really no reason to leave that extra damage on the table.
