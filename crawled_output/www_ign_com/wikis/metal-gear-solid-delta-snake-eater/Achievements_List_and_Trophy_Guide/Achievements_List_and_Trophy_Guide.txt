Time to Platinum MGS Delta: Snake Eater : Approximately 5-15 hours, depending on your difficulty setting (Expect more time required on the highest difficulty). Difficulty Required For All Trophies/Achievements: All except one achievement can be gained on any difficulty, with the final achievement requiring you to beat the game on Extreme and under specific parameters.
Missable Trophies: Many Achievements/Trophies can be missed, as there are several points of no return in a playthrough, and several collectibles only appear in a specific areas during chase sequences that you cannot return to or even stop if you miss it.
Number of Playthroughs Needed to Platinum: Though it is possible to get every trophy and achievement in one playthrough, it's recommended to do at least 2 (one for getting all collectibles, and a second on Extreme difficulty).Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Easter Achievements / Trophies1 Platinum Trophy4 Gold Trophies5 Silver Trophies36 Bronze TrophiesEndless BattleMama SaidTell Me Where the Bomb IsLike He Just Doesn't CareDon't Touch the SidesPrince CharmingUgly DucklingRalph CalledCan I Keep It?Snake EaterFoodieA Good Man is Hard to FindI Can Totally See YouTaste the Poison!CinephileFriendly FireSerenity NowBeekeeperJust BecauseMostly DeadMud ScientistWar Has ChangedOld Snake, New TricksPaparazzo SnakeBelieve It or NotIt Ain't Easy Being GreenIt's Duck SeasonLike a BossPEACE WALKERGastronomeA Snake Has Many SkinsFOXHOUNDOcelot Always Gets His ManYoung GunTime ParadoxPain ReliefYou Snooze, You LoseThe Early EndWax On, Wax OffIf It Bleeds, We Can Kill ItThe EndHouston, We HAD a ProblemRiver of PainGroundedShagadelicThe PatriotMetal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater Achievement and Trophy ChecklistMetal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater Trophies and AchievementsTrophy Achievement NameHow To GetTrophy TypeGamerscoreEndless BattleCollect All TrophiesPlatinumN/AMama SaidCQC Slam a guard and knock him outBronze15GTell Me Where the Bomb IsCQC Interrogate an enemyBronze15GLike He Just Doesn't CareHold up an enemyBronze15GDon't Touch the SidesUse a knife to remove a bulletBronze15GPrince CharmingAttack a Kerotan for the first timeBronze15GUgly DucklingAttack a GA-KO for the first timeBronze15GRalph CalledMake Snake throw upBronze15GCan I Keep It?Capture any animal aliveBronze15GSnake EaterEat a snake of any typeBronze15G10 Rows|Page 1 of 5<12345>Up Next: Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater GuidePreviousList of Completion Titles and RanksNextMetal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater GuideTop Guide SectionsMetal Gear Solid Delta Snake Eater Changes and DifferencesThings Metal Gear Solid Delta Snake Eater Doesn't Tell YouWalkthroughBoss GuidesWas this guide helpful?Leave feedbackIn This GuideMetal Gear Solid Δ: Snake EaterKCEJAug 28, 2025Learn moreGo to commentsReviews•Editor Columns•News•Guides•Upcoming Sales Events•How to Watch Guides•Board Game Reviews•GTA 5 Cheats•Best Streaming Bundles•IGN Store•Top Deals•Contact Us•IGN YouTube•HowLongToBeat•IGN TikTok•IGN Twitter•Map Genie•Eurogamer•Rock Paper Shotgun•VG247•Maxroll•Privacy Policy•Terms of Use
