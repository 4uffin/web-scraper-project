Explore Wheatflour WonderlandWheatflour Wonderland is a whole new region that you can explore. It is available after completing the Quest "Potion Problems," and is accessed via a door found in Hello Kitty's Cafe.
Wheatflour Wonderland is the game's biggest new region yet - it's almost as big as Friendship Island itself! It is divided into several areas, including the blossoming Wheatflower Fields, the majestic Citadel, and even the islands of Periwinkle Park and Critter Temple found high in the sky.
Here are just a few of the things you can find in Wheatflour Wonderland:
10 new Critters to catch A new cooking ingredient, Noodle Grass (and several new recipes to discover, including cup noodles, lo mein, spaghetti, and more!) Shiny new crafting materials: Jemmies, Shimmersand, and many different types of Gems! New Challenge Courses to complete, rewarding a new crafting material: Flecks! New comics to collect: Guardians of the Grain and Revolutionary Fairy A new flower, Wheatflower, which can be bred to create the new Glitter effect!...and much, much more!
Meet A New Friend, CogimyunCogimyun is an adorable Wheatflour Fairy who resides in Wheatflour Wonderland. Get to know her and raise her Friendship level up to the maximum - Level 35 - to earn Revolutionary Fairy comics and Cogimyun-themed furniture and color palettes.
Plus, complete Cogimyun's Friendship Quests to uncover a fascinating story. Help Cogimyun locate new Wheatflour Guardians to re-awaken all the areas of Wheatflour Wonderland. If you find all of the Wheatflour Guardians, you will be able to enter the locked door at the heart of the Citadel and claim the treasure inside!
New Mini-Games To PlayCogimyun brings with her two friends: her beloved pet, Ebi Fry, and her brother Cogimyon. Each of them offers a new Mini-Game to play as well, both of which reward Gems and exclusive Wheatflour Wonderland furniture in Easy, Normal, and Hard difficulties.
Ebi Fry hosts "Find Ebi Fry." Ebi Fry will transform into an object, and you will be tasked to find him in a variety of colorful settings in this "spot the difference" game.
Cogimyon hosts "Catch Cogimyon." Cogimyon will turn into a Critter, and you will have to pick him out of a crowd of normal Critters. Hint: the transformed Cogimyon tends to behave differently, such as moving faster, slower, or in a different direction than the others!
Find Hidden WheatheartsScattered all around Wheatflour Wonderland are over one hundred Wheathearts for you to find. You'll need to open chests, light lamps, activate Flowl statues, and even photograph some Wheathearts that are cleverly camouflaging themselves by pretending to be part of the landscape!
Once you've collected enough Wheathearts, you can trade them in for rewards at the Wheatheart Tree. These rewards include exclusive Wheatflour Wonderland clothing items that you can dress up in to show your Wheatflour Wonderland pride!
Craft Magical New WandsHelp Chococat restore the Wand Forge to gain the ability to craft Wands, a new Tool to use. Each type of Wand has a different effect, from breaking Gemstone-powered shields to letting you turn into Wheatflour Wonderland Critters and even inanimate objects such as crafting materials and cooked meals.
Turn into everything from a Flowl to a Stick with the power of Wheatflour Wonderland's magic wands. Discover them all by completing Wheatflour Wonderland Quests!
Unlock Magical Outfits For You And Your FriendsComplete Tuxedosam's Quest "Fairy Glamour" to unlock magical dresses, suits, top hats, and bows that you can wear to show off your magical Wheatflour Wonderland style! Plus, you can unlock some additional magical girl outfits as rewards by completing Cogimyun's Friendship Quests.
Additionally, several Hello Kitty Island Adventure characters can unlock stylish new Wheatflour Guardian outfits to wear. We won't tell you exactly who - you'll have to go through Wheatflour Wonderland's Quests to find out!
