She asks you to bring her the following ingredients:
5 x Glow Berry - picked in the Spooky Swamp 35 x MushroomFirst Potion IngredientsGive the ingredients to Kuromi at the Potion Hut, then watch as she attempts to make a potion. Unfortunately, what comes out is extremely cute, and not spooky at all!

5 x Spinip - picked at the edge of water in the Spooky Swamp 5 x Pumpkin - picked from the pumpkin patch outside Kuromi's hut in the Spooky SwampSecond Potion IngredientsReturn to the Potion Hut and give the ingredients to Kuromi. The same thing happens again - she winds up with a cute, sparkly potion instead of her gothic dream!
Get Help From My MelodyAfter the second failure, My Melody will show up. After hearing what's been going on, she offers to help. My Melody asks you to bring her a Blank Book, so she can take notes about Kuromi's attempts.
You can craft a Blank Book at a Crafting Table using the following materials:
3 x PaperBadtz-Maru's return gift OR 3 x Lotus Blossom - picked in the Seaside Resort or Spooky SwampBlank BookGive the Blank Book to My Melody, then watch as Kuromi yet again makes an adorable potion by accident. My Melody suggests that what Kuromi needs is a break, so head over to Hello Kitty's Cafe in the Seaside Resort.
Hello Kitty is busy, so she asks you to make a snack for Kuromi. Whip up four slices of Pumpkin Pie in the Oven using the following ingredients:
4 x Flour - My Melody's return gift 4 x Pumpkin - picked from the patch outside Kuromi's hut in the Spooky SwampPumpkin PieAfter cooking the Pumpkin Pie, talk to Hello Kitty, and Kuromi will show her the potion. The strange potion interacts with the Flour in Hello Kitty's Cafe and causes a glowing door to appear!
Enter Wheatflour WonderlandGo through the door and talk to Kuromi on the other side. She, My Melody, and Hello Kitty have no idea what this strange place is, and have never been there before. As you all are trying to figure out where you are, a new friend, Cogimyun, will appear!
Cogimyun explains that she is a Wheatflour Fairy and that this place is called Wheatflour Wonderland. It used to be protected by Wheatflour Guardians, but they have long since disappeared. Also missing is her pet, Ebi Fry. The Quest ends as you promise to help Cogimyun restore Wheatflour Wonderland to its former glory. Hello Kitty even gives you a Friendship Bouquet to help you befriend Cogimyun!
