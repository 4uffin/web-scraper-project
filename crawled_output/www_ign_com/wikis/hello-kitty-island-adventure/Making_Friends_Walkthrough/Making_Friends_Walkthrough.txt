It is unlocked upon reaching Friendship Level 8 with Cogimyun and completing Hello Kitty's Quest "Blossoming Friendship." To raise Cogimyun's Friendship Level, give her gifts from around Wheatflour Wonderland, such as Fluffnys, Flowls, Wheatflowers, or Noodle Grass.
As soon as Cogimyun hits Friendship Level 8, you can begin this Quest by talking to Hello Kitty, who will be on Friendship Island - likely in her Cafe.

We're working hard to verify that all of our guide info is up-to-date... stay tuned!
Help Cogimyun Make New FriendsTalk to Hello Kitty, who tells you that she's worried about Cogimyun, because Cogimyun still does not feel strong enough to visit Friendship Island and search for Ebi Fry. She suggests that you can help Cogimyun be less afraid of Friendship Island by having other residents come to Wheatflour Wonderland to meet her.
You agree to the plan, so head back to Wheatflour Wonderland. Cogimyun will be on the left side of the Wheatflower Fields, south of the Royal Gardens. Talk to her, and she agrees to meet the Friendship Island residents who have come to see her.
Lead Cogimyun around the Royal Gardens and talk to the following characters at the following locations:
Tuxedosam - South balcony of the Royal Gardens Keroppi and Pochacco - Just east of the fountain in the center of the Royal Gardens Chococat - Near the right border of the Royal GardensHave Cogimyun Make FriendsSee Chococat's DiscoveryCogimyun does well meeting all the Friendship Island residents, asking them about what sort of objects or Critters they might want to transform into. When you reach Chococat, he informs you that he made a strange discovery and wants you to see it.
Follow Chococat to the second floor of the Citadel on the right side. There is a blue barrier here that you cannot get past. Talk to Chococat, who thinks that there is something interesting past the barrier, and he suggests checking out the Flowl statue next to it.
Stand next to the Flowl statue and interact with it using the prompt provided ("T" button if using keyboard, "X" button if using controller or Steam Deck, "Y" button if using Nintendo Switch.) A beam will shoot out from the statue and strike the barrier. You will need to fire the statue's beam about five times before the barrier finally breaks.
Follow Chococat up the stairs to a platform with several strange objects on it. (There's a Fast Travel Mailbox here - make sure to activate it, as you'll be visiting this location a lot!)
Help Chococat Repair The Wand ForgeTalk to Chococat, who thinks that one of the platforms is some form of Crafting Table. He wants to try fixing it, but he's going to need a few items from you to do so.
Gift Chococat the following:
3 x Gizmo - Chococat's return gift 3 x Spark - 1 Spark is crafted using 3 Light Stones, Kuromi's return giftHis first attempt to restore the possible Crafting Table doesn't workTap to RevealChococat is inspired to try again. Gift him three more Sparks and three more Gizmos. (If you need more Gizmos or Light Stones, use Friendship Blossoms or Friendship Bouquets to give Chococat and Kuromi more Gifts.)
This time, Chococat's attempt to restore the ancient machine works perfectly. But it turns out it's not a Crafting Table at all - it's a Wand Forge!
Wand Forge RepairedCraft A Test WandThis Wand Forge allows you to craft Wands, unique items that create a variety of wondrous effects when used around Wheatflour Wonderland. (They also make great Gifts for Cogimyun!) Chococat gives you the recipe for a Test Wand and asks you to make one right away to test out the Wand Forge.
You will need the following materials:
1 x Stick - found in Seaside Resort, Gemstone Mountain, and the Snow Village, caught when fishing for Clamfish, crafted using 2 Worm Tails 3 x Jemmies - found in all areas of Wheatflour WonderlandOnce you have the necessary materials, craft the Test Wand at the Wand Forge. Talk to Chococat, who then asks you to equip the wand and try it out. There is a new "Wands" section of your Inventory where all of your Wands are stored. Equip the Test Wand from there by selecting "Wear", then talk to Chococat again, who decides that he is still not done experimenting with the Wand Forge's capabilities.
Test Wand CraftedCraft A Quartz WandChococat now wants to experiment with creating an even more powerful Wand - and, of course, he'll need your help to do it. He asks you to gather the following ingredients:
5 x Bronze Flecks - obtained from successfully running any Challenge Course in Wheatflour Wonderland 5 x Quartz - found around Wheatflour WonderlandYou can find a variety of Gems scattered throughout Wheatflour Wonderland. Which gems spawn IS randomized, but the Gem spawn locations are not. See our Gemstone Location guide to learn more!
After you have collected all of the necessary materials, return to the Crafting Court. Talk to Hello Kitty to officially receive the Magic Wand recipe. In addition to the Quartz and Flecks you previously gathered, you will need:
5 x Fairy Dust - Cogimyun's return giftAlso, you can OPTIONALLY add one of the following to your Wand as decoration.
1 x Feather - Pekkle's return gift 1 x Ingot - crafted using 3 Iron Ore, found in Gemstone Mountain or Mount Hothead 1 x Spark - crafted using 3 Light Stone, Kuromi's return gift Use the Wand Forge and combine the Fairy Dust, Quartz, and Bronze Flecks (and optional decoration item, if you choose) into a Quartz Wand. Talk to Hello Kitty, who tells you that you can now use the Tool Wheel to switch between different types of Wands that you have in your inventory.
Quartz Wand CraftedUse the Tool Wheel to switch from the Test Wand to the Quartz Wand. Then, use the Quartz Wand once to see that you now have the ability to shoot out bright beams of light. You aren't quite sure what this does yet, but you'll figure it out!
Finally, talk to Cogimyun. She is excited, because Chococat thinks that the different types of Wands you can make might be the key to waking up more of Wheatflour Wonderland. She says that she's inspired by Chococat, and feels almost ready to go to Friendship Island. The Quest concludes here with Cogimyun feeling braver than ever!
