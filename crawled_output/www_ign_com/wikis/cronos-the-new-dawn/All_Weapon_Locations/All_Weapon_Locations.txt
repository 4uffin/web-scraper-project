You'll start the game with a basic pistol, but there are other survival horror staples like shotguns and high-power rifles waiting for you later on. This IGN guide will show you where to find every single weapon in Cronos: The New Dawn so you can easily blast your way through the Orphans.
Cronos: The New Dawn Weapon LocationsThere are 7 weapons to collect in Cronos: The New Dawn. While each weapon is just a different variation of the morphing multi-tool that the Traveler is equipped with, they still take up valuable inventory space. Choose your arsenal wisely.

You'll find this safe room after passing through the Isolation Zone with all the hospital beds and medical supplies. You'll catch a brief glimpse of a wall-crawling Orphan just before you arrive.
This isn't an optional safe room, so you can't miss it. You'll also circle back here after getting the Gravity Boots in case you forget to grab the Dagger the first time around.
