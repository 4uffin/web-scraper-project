By completing tasks like using a Watering Can or harvesting certain plants, you'll be rewarded once per 24 hours based on your contributions. Find out more about how Fall Energy works and the many tasks you may get.
What is Fall Energy and How to Get it in Grow a GardenThe Fall Update expansion added a new NPC to the middle of the island who gives out Fall Activities. This works similarly to certain past events, where you can complete tasks to get rewards. However, you won't immediately get anything, since rewards are only given out once per 12 hours, but it was originally every 24 hours. You'll need to speak with the Fall Activities NPC to claim your rewards.
If you want to get Fall Energy, you'll have to complete the Fall Activities at this new character. By speaking with them, they have a dialogue choice that says, "See Activities". Tap on this choice to see what three tasks you currently have. Completing a task gives 20 Fall Energy, but it originally gave 10. Then, a new task will appear.
These activities appear to be a combination of generic tasks to complete and fall-themed ones. If you get too many that you're struggling with or can't complete, you can reroll tasks for 50,000 Sheckles. This appears to double each time you reroll. For example, after rerolling once, it'll then cost 100,000 Sheckles to do again.
The simple lore of this event is that you're gaining Fall Energy to give to the Heartseed for rewards. While we don't know much about the Heartseed, we do know from the Harvest Spirit that the Heartseed watches over fall and the markets. For whatever reason, the plants we bring to the Harvest Spirit will nourish the Heartseed.
Here are some examples of Fall Activities you can get:
Harvest 10 Parsleys Harvest 5 Turnips Hatch 1 Fall Egg Feed any pet 3 times Use a watering can on 10 growing plants Travel 1000 studs with a Leafblower Place 3x Basic Sprinklers Grow a Salmon to age 10 Trigger a Fall Bloom 1 timeEach time you complete a Fall Activity, a message will also appear letting you know that you did. This is a useful way to let you know that you should check for new ones to complete!
How to Get Rewards From Fall ActivitiesIf you want to get rewards from this new feature, you'll have to complete a bunch of Fall Activities. As previously mentioned, while you won't immediately get anything from completing them, you will get Fall Energy. Once per 12 hours, it appears you'll get rewards based on how much energy you've gotten that day. You'll need to speak with the Fall Activities NPC to claim your rewards, even though they were originally given automatically.
This event seems to function closer to the Summer Harvest Event, where your Fall Energy is connected to the rarity of the rewards you get. Here are the rewards you can get based on how much Fall Energy you've gained:
