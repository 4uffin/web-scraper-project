By completing tasks like using a Watering Can or harvesting certain plants, you'll be rewarded once per 24 hours based on your contributions. Find out more about how Fall Energy works and the many tasks you may get.
This guide is a work-in-progress as we learn more about the rewards you can get from participating in this event.What is Fall Energy and How to Get it in Grow a GardenThe Fall Update expansion added a new NPC to the middle of the island who gives out Fall Activities. This works similarly to certain past events, where you can complete tasks to get rewards. However, you won't immediately get anything, since rewards are only given out once per 24 hours.
If you want to get Fall Energy, you'll have to complete the Fall Activities at this new character. By speaking with them, they have a dialogue choice that says, "See Activities". Tap on this choice to see what three tasks you currently have. Completing a task gives 10 Fall Energy as we've confirmed so far. Then, a new task will appear.
These activities appear to be a combination of generic tasks to complete and fall-themed ones. If you get too many that you're struggling with or can't complete, you can reroll tasks for 50,000 Sheckles. This appears to double each time you reroll. For example, after rerolling once, it'll then cost 100,000 Sheckles to do again.
The simple lore of this event is that you're gaining Fall Energy to give to the Heartseed for rewards. While we don't know much about the Heartseed, we do know from the Harvest Spirit that the Heartseed watches over fall and the markets. For whatever reason, the plants we bring to the Harvest Spirit will nourish the Heartseed.
Here are some examples of Fall Activities you can get:
Harvest 10 Parsleys Harvest 5 Turnips Hatch 1 Fall Egg Feed any pet 3 times Use a watering can on 10 growing plants Travel 1000 studs with a Leafblower Place 3x Basic Sprinklers Grow a Salmon to age 10 Trigger a Fall Bloom 1 timeEach time you complete a Fall Activity, a message will also appear letting you know that you did. This is a useful way to let you know that you should check for new ones to complete!
How to Get Rewards From Fall ActivitiesIf you want to get rewards from this new feature, you'll have to complete a bunch of Fall Activities. As previously mentioned, while you won't immediately get anything from completing them, you will get Fall Energy. Once per 24 hours, it appears you'll get rewards based on how much energy you've gotten that day.This event seems to function closer to the Summer Harvest Event, where your Fall Energy is connected to the rarity of the rewards you get. We'll try to update this area as we figure out the thresholds for each rarity:

For those of you in the EDT time zone, rewards are given out at 8 p.m. Another quick time zone to mention is PDT, where rewards are given at 5 p.m. The exact time will vary depending on where you live and what your time zone is.
We'll update this section once we learn what type of rewards you can get from participating in this event. For now, we can only speculate that they'll be related to the Fall Update. Such as anything you can get from the Fall Market stalls.Up Next: Fall Market Event UpdatePreviousAll Berry Plants and How to Get ThemNextFall Market Event UpdateTop Guide SectionsBeginner's Guide to Grow a Garden - Tips and TricksAll Mutations and Multipliers in Grow a GardenAll Pets, Pet Eggs, Abilities, and TraitsAll Grow a Garden Seeds, Crop, and Seed PacksWas this guide helpful?Leave feedbackIn This GuideGrow a Garden [Roblox]The Garden GameMar 25, 2025+1Learn moreGo to commentsReviews•Editor Columns•News•Guides•Upcoming Sales Events•How to Watch Guides•Board Game Reviews•GTA 5 Cheats•Best Streaming Bundles•IGN Store•Top Deals•Contact Us•IGN YouTube•HowLongToBeat•IGN TikTok•IGN Twitter•Map Genie•Eurogamer•Rock Paper Shotgun•VG247•Maxroll•Privacy Policy•Terms of Use
