How to Start Expedition 19 Expedition Tips Expedition Milestones Phase 1 Phase 2 Phase 3 Phase 4 Phase 5 Final Phase (Phase 6)How to Start Expedition 19To begin Expedition 19: Corvette, you'll need to start a new game. Whether you play with others or solo, you'll be able to select the Expedition game type from the corresponding menu.
Expedition TipsExpeditions are time-limited events, meaning you need to complete it before the deadline or lose out on any rewards. While most of the items you earn aren't account wide, you'll be able to use any of the Phase rewards on your other saves once unlocked.
When it comes to completing the different phase milestones, many of them can be completed simultaneously, regardless of the phase they are listed under. Required items, like the Fishing Rod unit for your Multi-Tool, are often rewarded in prior milestones, but that doesn't mean you can't buy the module early.
Take a look at all the requirements for Expedition and see what you can build or complete that counts towards multiple milestones. You can travel to a Pirate system, defeat Corrupt Sentinels, discover animals on a Dissonance planet, and soon after smuggle out expensive items, to complete four objectives in a short amount of time.
Expedition 19 MilestonesSix phases make up a total of 35 milestones, with two additional Optional Milestones, to complete during Expedition 19: Corvette. You have to finish all 34 milestones in Phases 1-5 to attain the Final Phase milestone and reward.
Phase 1There are seven milestones to complete in Phase 1. Most of them revolve around building your Corvette and finding upgrades for it.
