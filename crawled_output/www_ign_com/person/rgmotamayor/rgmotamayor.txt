He has over five years of experience in the animation industry with bylines at Vulture, IndieWire, and more. He was also part of a New York Press Club award-winning team of writers.
When he isn't writing, you can find him trying to catch up on the new seasonal anime before realizing how impossible that is, or thinking about how great Lost was. He has a relatively healthy obsession with model kits, and posts all about them on Twitter @RafaelMotamayor.Latest from Rafael MotamayorLatestVideosArticlesReviewsGuide Edits12d ago12d ago - For better and worse, it's more Demon Slayer.Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Infinity CastleRafael Motamayor126Jul 11, 2025Jul 11, 2025 - A galaxy-spanning blockbuster with fantastic action, stunning visuals, and a singular villain.FoundationRafael Motamayor103Jul 3, 2025Jul 3, 2025 - A fun and adorable take on the zombie genre.Nyaight of the Living CatRafael Motamayor20Jun 21, 2025Jun 21, 2025 - Where to begin?
