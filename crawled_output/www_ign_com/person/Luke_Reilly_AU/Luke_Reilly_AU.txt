A member of IGN's multi-award winning Australian editorial crew, he is based just outside of Sydney where he sees few kangaroos but loads of cows, which traditionally aren't as strong at jumping. A journalist with 20 years of media experience covering games, Luke previously served as the editor of Official PlayStation Magazine – Australia and Australian 360 before joining IGN in 2011, when people sadly began to realise they didn't need to buy information on paper anymore.
With experience that dates back to the Atari 2600, Luke's eclectic taste in games includes racers, single-player shooters, open-world action, extreme sports, stealth, air combat, music and rhythm, and '90s PC platformers. Around 60% of the games Luke reviews for IGN have cars in them, and an additional handful have skateboards – which are like tiny wooden cars you stand on. When he's not playing Forza Horizon, Grand Theft Auto, Rock Band, or Skate he's also particularly fond of cricket, dad fiction, rock and/or roll, and movies where vigilantes kill lots of bad guys.
He has been described as tall.Latest from Luke ReillyLatestVideosArticlesReviewsGuide Edits17h ago17h ago - Playground Games speaks with IGN about making a map that feels authentic to Japanese players and international gamers alike.Forza Horizon 6Luke Reilly82d ago2d ago - Skate to say I told you so.SkateLuke Reilly7514:362d ago2d ago - Skate to say I told you so.SkateLuke Reilly + 1 moreSep 9, 2025Sep 9, 2025 - Rome, if you want to.Indiana Jones and the Great Circle: The Order of GiantsLuke Reilly276:03Sep 9, 2025Sep 9, 2025 - Rome, if you want to.Indiana Jones and the Great Circle: The Order of GiantsLuke Reilly + 1 moreAug 28, 2025Aug 28, 2025 - Prime SEAL, delivered.The Terminal List: Dark WolfLuke Reilly103Aug 27, 2025Aug 27, 2025 - This twin-stick racer from the makers of Hot Wheels Unleashed boasts some surprising complexity beneath the surface.ScreamerLuke Reilly56:44Aug 27, 2025Aug 27, 2025ScreamerLuke Reilly + 1 more22:14Aug 8, 2025Aug 8, 2025 - Sicilian style.Mafia: The Old CountryLuke ReillyAug 7, 2025Aug 7, 2025 - Sicilian style.Mafia: The Old CountryLuke Reilly334Load MoreReviews•Editor Columns•News•Guides•Upcoming Sales Events•How to Watch Guides•Board Game Reviews•GTA 5 Cheats•Best Streaming Bundles•IGN Store•Top Deals•Contact Us•IGN YouTube•HowLongToBeat•IGN TikTok•IGN Twitter•Map Genie•Eurogamer•Rock Paper Shotgun•VG247•Maxroll•Privacy Policy•Terms of Use
