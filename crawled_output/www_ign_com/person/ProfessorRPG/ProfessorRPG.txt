With a passion for RPGs, board games, fighting games, and pretty much anything to do with giant robots, Scott’s words can be found elsewhere on the internet, including over at RPGSite, IrrationalPassions, Polygon, ArsTechnica, and DualShockers. You can also hear him on his podcast, RPG University, along with guests from around the game industry, including some from here at IGN! He is also a staunch supporter of video game randomizers and believes everyone should play “The Legend of Heroes: Trails” games.
