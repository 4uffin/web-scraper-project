Tom enjoys puzzle games, platformers, puzzle-platformers, and eclectic mix of many of genres that don't involve puzzles or platforming. He has a fondness for games off the beaten trail, but can still appreciate a big-budget spectacle full of flair as well – be that full of comic book characters or brand new ones.Latest from Tom MarksLatestVideosArticlesReviewsGuide Edits11h ago11h ago - An unapologetically challenging sequel packed full of sharp platforming, enticing exploration, and nail-biting combat.Hollow Knight: SilksongTom Marks88612d ago12d ago - Reveals for Magic's Spider-Man set are in full swing.Magic The GatheringTom MarksAug 27, 2025Aug 27, 2025 - This add-on offers some appetizing new levels, but left me hungry for something meteor.Kirby and the Forgotten Land - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star-Crossed WorldTom Marks35348:31Aug 27, 2025Aug 27, 2025Kirby Air RidersLogan Plant + 2 moreAug 25, 2025Aug 25, 2025 - Magic's most popular live event puts its players in the shoes of a playtester.Magic The GatheringTom Marks1Aug 18, 2025Aug 18, 2025 - That would have been a sticky situation.Magic: The GatheringTom Marks4Aug 14, 2025Aug 14, 2025 - A hands-on first look at over 100 brand new cards from Magic's Avatar crossover.AvatarTom Marks199:16Aug 14, 2025Aug 14, 2025AvatarJesse Gomez + 1 moreJul 23, 2025Jul 23, 2025 - A multiversal first look at five different versions of the famous webslinger.Magic The GatheringTom Marks32Jul 9, 2025Jul 9, 2025 - We've got an early look at Magic's first space-themed set.Magic The GatheringTom Marks1Load MoreReviews•Editor Columns•News•Guides•Upcoming Sales Events•How to Watch Guides•Board Game Reviews•GTA 5 Cheats•Best Streaming Bundles•IGN Store•Top Deals•Contact Us•IGN YouTube•HowLongToBeat•IGN TikTok•IGN Twitter•Map Genie•Eurogamer•Rock Paper Shotgun•VG247•Maxroll•Privacy Policy•Terms of Use
