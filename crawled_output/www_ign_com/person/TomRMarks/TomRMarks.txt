He first joined IGN to cover PC gaming in 2017 before transitioning to the reviews team, having previously worked at PC Gamer for three years before that.
Tom enjoys puzzle games, platformers, puzzle-platformers, and eclectic mix of many of genres that don't involve puzzles or platforming. He has a fondness for games off the beaten trail, but can still appreciate a big-budget spectacle full of flair as well – be that full of comic book characters or brand new ones.Latest from Tom MarksLatestVideosArticlesReviewsGuide Edits20:461d ago1d agoHades IIChris Del Padre + 2 more19:215d ago5d agoNintendo Switch 2Brian Altano + 3 more201:47:586d ago6d agoDonkey Kong Bananza: DK Island & Emerald RushBrian Altano + 3 more220:269d ago9d agoHollow Knight: SilksongTom Marks11d ago11d ago - An unapologetically challenging sequel packed full of sharp platforming, enticing exploration, and nail-biting combat.Hollow Knight: SilksongTom Marks1.1kSep 2, 2025Sep 2, 2025 - Reveals for Magic's Spider-Man set are in full swing.Magic The GatheringTom MarksAug 27, 2025Aug 27, 2025 - This add-on offers some appetizing new levels, but left me hungry for something meteor.Kirby and the Forgotten Land - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star-Crossed WorldTom Marks35348:31Aug 27, 2025Aug 27, 2025Kirby Air RidersLogan Plant + 2 moreAug 25, 2025Aug 25, 2025 - Magic's most popular live event puts its players in the shoes of a playtester.Magic The GatheringTom Marks1Aug 18, 2025Aug 18, 2025 - That would have been a sticky situation.Magic: The GatheringTom Marks4Load MoreReviews•Editor Columns•News•Guides•Upcoming Sales Events•How to Watch Guides•Board Game Reviews•GTA 5 Cheats•Best Streaming Bundles•IGN Store•Top Deals•Contact Us•IGN YouTube•HowLongToBeat•IGN TikTok•IGN Twitter•Map Genie•Eurogamer•Rock Paper Shotgun•VG247•Maxroll•Privacy Policy•Terms of Use
