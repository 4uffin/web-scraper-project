He spent over six years as an editor and host at GameSpot and took a brief detour to be a section head at Fanbyte. You may have seen him making regular appearances with his friends at Giant Bomb and Kinda Funny.
Although he now claims the Bay Area, he still reps his Southeast San Diego roots hard. And don't bother asking if he's Filipino, he probably already told you first.Latest from Michael HighamLatestVideosArticlesReviewsGuide Edits1d ago1d ago - You don't need to ball out for a great gaming headset.HS65 SurroundMichael Higham888:132d ago2d agoBlackShark V3 ProMichael Higham16:032d ago2d agoGTA 6Michael Higham + 2 more601:04:142d ago2d agoAllyMichael Higham + 2 more125:487d ago7d agoXbox Game PassMichael Higham + 1 more301:16:209d ago9d agoBorderlands 4Michael Higham + 1 more11d ago11d ago - Compact without compromise.BlackWidow V4 Low-ProfileMichael Higham48:42Sep 4, 2025Sep 4, 2025007 First LightMichael Higham + 2 more01:05:06Sep 4, 2025Sep 4, 2025007 First LightLogan Plant + 3 more1Sep 3, 2025Sep 3, 2025 - The Pulse Elite and Pulse Explore have been upgraded with a new PC driver.PlayStation Pulse EliteMichael Higham12Load MoreReviews•Editor Columns•News•Guides•Upcoming Sales Events•How to Watch Guides•Board Game Reviews•GTA 5 Cheats•Best Streaming Bundles•IGN Store•Top Deals•Contact Us•IGN YouTube•HowLongToBeat•IGN TikTok•IGN Twitter•Map Genie•Eurogamer•Rock Paper Shotgun•VG247•Maxroll•Privacy Policy•Terms of Use
