He spent over six years as an editor and host at GameSpot and took a brief detour to be a section head at Fanbyte. You may have seen him making regular appearances with his friends at Giant Bomb and Kinda Funny.
Although he now claims the Bay Area, he still reps his Southeast San Diego roots hard. And don't bother asking if he's Filipino, he probably already told you first.Latest from Michael HighamLatestVideosArticlesReviewsGuide Edits20:4452m ago52m agoForza Horizon 6Michael Higham + 2 more22:1211h ago11h agoXbox Series SMichael Higham + 2 more311h ago11h ago - Atsu's path of vengeance is paved with bloody samurai action and a more human story.Ghost of YoteiMichael Higham84501:13:4611h ago11h agoForza HorizonMichael Higham + 2 more801:09:3911h ago11h agoGhost of YoteiBrian Altano + 4 more18:4611h ago11h agoGhost of YoteiMichael Higham6d ago6d ago - You don't need to ball out for a great gaming headset.HS65 SurroundMichael Higham888:137d ago7d agoBlackShark V3 ProMichael Higham16:037d ago7d agoGTA 6Michael Higham + 2 more601:04:147d ago7d agoAllyMichael Higham + 2 more1Load MoreReviews•Editor Columns•News•Guides•Upcoming Sales Events•How to Watch Guides•Board Game Reviews•GTA 5 Cheats•Best Streaming Bundles•IGN Store•Top Deals•Contact Us•IGN YouTube•HowLongToBeat•IGN TikTok•IGN Twitter•Map Genie•Eurogamer•Rock Paper Shotgun•VG247•Maxroll•Privacy Policy•Terms of Use
