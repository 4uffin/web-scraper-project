When Eric isn't hunting for deals for other people at work, he's hunting for deals for himself during his free time. The best deal he's recently found was a LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon 751982 kit for about $200 (normally $800) thanks to a Target price error. When he's not racking up freemogems in Genshin Impact or attempting to lose weight with Beat Saber, Eric's out in the Pacific ocean on his kayak fishing for salmon and halibut.Latest from Eric SongLatestVideosArticlesReviewsGuide Edits18m ago18m ago - An affordable option if you're looking for 1440p or high-fps 1080p gaming performance.Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070Eric Song2h ago2h ago - Including new Alienware Area-51 gaming PCs and laptops.Alienware Aurora R15Eric Song1052h ago2h ago - Outperforms more expensive Intel and AMD processors in games.Eric Song13h ago3h ago - And they sound a lot better than I expected.Eric Song103h ago3h ago - Top the line specs including a liquid cooled Intel Core Ultra 9 CPU, 64GB of RAM, and a 2TB SSD.Legion Tower 7iEric Song14h ago4h ago - It ships from a local US warehouse so you don't have to worry about tariffs.Eric Song65h ago5h ago - Better than buying a used PS5 controller off Facebook marketplace.DualSense EdgeEric Song56h ago6h ago - Falling GPU prices are also lowering prices on premium prebuilt gaming PCs.Alienware Aurora R16Eric Song6h ago6h ago - The e-bikes are meant for responsible adults, featuring top speeds of up to 32mph and 80 mile range.Eric Song116h ago6h ago - You'll be able to play and charge your Switch or Switch 2 simultaneously.Nintendo SwitchEric SongLoad MoreReviews•Editor Columns•News•Guides•Upcoming Sales Events•How to Watch Guides•Board Game Reviews•GTA 5 Cheats•Best Streaming Bundles•IGN Store•Top Deals•Contact Us•IGN YouTube•HowLongToBeat•IGN TikTok•IGN Twitter•Map Genie•Eurogamer•Rock Paper Shotgun•VG247•Maxroll•Privacy Policy•Terms of Use
