When Eric isn't hunting for deals for other people at work, he's hunting for deals for himself during his free time. The best deal he's recently found was a LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon 751982 kit for about $200 (normally $800) thanks to a Target price error. When he's not racking up freemogems in Genshin Impact or attempting to lose weight with Beat Saber, Eric's out in the Pacific ocean on his kayak fishing for salmon and halibut.Latest from Eric SongLatestVideosArticlesReviewsGuide Edits1d ago1d ago - These cables are perfect for your Nintendo Switch 2, iPhone 17, or even your laptop.Eric Song11d ago1d ago - Falling GPU prices are also lowering prices on premium prebuit gaming PCs.Alienware Aurora R16Eric Song41d ago1d ago - Sony recently raised the retail price of the PS5 consoles to $500 and $550.PlayStation 5Eric Song1d ago1d ago - The Paper Pro Move has all the features of the Paper Pro in a more pocketable form factor.Eric Song61d ago1d ago - And they sound a lot better than I expected.Eric Song41d ago1d ago - It also happens to be on sale today.Alienware m16Eric Song1d ago1d ago - You won't find a less expensive (and still well-made) 3D printer anywhere else.Eric Song11d ago1d ago - Don't miss this opportunity to save extra on gaming handhelds, PS5 consoles, electric bikes, and more.Eric Song1d ago1d ago - Including new Alienware Area-51 gaming PCs and laptops.Alienware Aurora R15Eric Song1051d ago1d ago - Get a brand new, region-unlocked imported copy for just $52.49.Donkey Kong BananzaEric Song1Load MoreReviews•Editor Columns•News•Guides•Upcoming Sales Events•How to Watch Guides•Board Game Reviews•GTA 5 Cheats•Best Streaming Bundles•IGN Store•Top Deals•Contact Us•IGN YouTube•HowLongToBeat•IGN TikTok•IGN Twitter•Map Genie•Eurogamer•Rock Paper Shotgun•VG247•Maxroll•Privacy Policy•Terms of Use
