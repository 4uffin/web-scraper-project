When Eric isn't hunting for deals for other people at work, he's hunting for deals for himself during his free time. The best deal he's recently found was a LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon 751982 kit for about $200 (normally $800) thanks to a Target price error. When he's not racking up freemogems in Genshin Impact or attempting to lose weight with Beat Saber, Eric's out in the Pacific ocean on his kayak fishing for salmon and halibut.Latest from Eric SongLatestVideosArticlesReviewsGuide Edits10h ago10h ago - This is a $50 price drop compared to a similar deal during the Walmart Labor Day Sale.Nvidia RTX 5060Eric Song13h ago13h ago - An affordable option if you're looking for 1440p or high-fps 1080p gaming performance.Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070Eric Song115h ago15h ago - Outperforms more expensive Intel and AMD processors in games.Eric Song415h ago15h ago - Including new Alienware Area-51 gaming PCs and laptops.Alienware Aurora R15Eric Song10516h ago16h ago - And they sound a lot better than I expected.Eric Song1016h ago16h ago - Top the line specs including a liquid cooled Intel Core Ultra 9 CPU, 64GB of RAM, and a 2TB SSD.Legion Tower 7iEric Song217h ago17h ago - It ships from a local US warehouse so you don't have to worry about tariffs.Eric Song718h ago18h ago - Better than buying a used PS5 controller off Facebook marketplace.DualSense EdgeEric Song519h ago19h ago - Falling GPU prices are also lowering prices on premium prebuilt gaming PCs.Alienware Aurora R16Eric Song120h ago20h ago - The e-bikes are meant for responsible adults, featuring top speeds of up to 32mph and 80 mile range.Eric Song11Load MoreReviews•Editor Columns•News•Guides•Upcoming Sales Events•How to Watch Guides•Board Game Reviews•GTA 5 Cheats•Best Streaming Bundles•IGN Store•Top Deals•Contact Us•IGN YouTube•HowLongToBeat•IGN TikTok•IGN Twitter•Map Genie•Eurogamer•Rock Paper Shotgun•VG247•Maxroll•Privacy Policy•Terms of Use
