Plus, audiences will get bonus content straight from writer/director Michael Dougherty himself!Since its release, Trick ‘r Treat has grown into a modern Halloween classic—part horror anthology, part cautionary tale, and 100% wicked fun. At the center of it all is “Sam,” the mischievous spirit who punishes anyone who dares to break the rules. Sam’s lasting impact has made him one of the top-selling Halloween icons nationwide, transforming him into the unofficial mascot of the holiday in homes across America. Written and directed by Michael Dougherty (Krampus, Godzilla: King of the Monsters), Trick ‘r Treat weaves together sinister stories set on Halloween night: a high school principal, Dylan Baker (Spider-Man 2, Spider-Man 3) moonlights as a serial killer; a young virgin’s, Anna Paquin (X-Men franchise) search for the right man turns horrific; “Emma” Leslie Bibb (“The White Lotus”) and her husband discover the cost of ignoring holiday rituals; and a cantankerous old man, Brian Cox (“Succession”) faces Sam in a terrifying showdown. Darkly funny, gruesome, and endlessly rewatchable, Trick ’r Treat secures Sam’s place as the true spirit of Halloween.ShareDid you enjoy this video?Leave feedbackIn This VideoTrick 'r TreatWarner Bros.
