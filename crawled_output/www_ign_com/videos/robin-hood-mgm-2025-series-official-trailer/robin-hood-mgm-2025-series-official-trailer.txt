From Lionsgate Television and co-created by executive producers John Glenn and Jonathan English (who also directed the pilot), and Todd Lieberman of Hidden Pictures, who was also an executive producer, Robin Hood stars Jack Patten as Rob, Lauren McQueen as Marian, Sean Bean as the Sheriff of Nottingham, Lydia Peckham as Priscilla of Nottingham, Steven Waddington as the Earl of Huntingdon and Connie Nielsen as Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine.In 12th-century England, Saxons live under the crushing rule of Norman power. Among them is Robert of Locksley, the son of a forester, whose life is shattered when his family is stripped of their ancestral home and his father is executed by the Sheriff of Nottingham. Gifted with the longbow, Rob grows from grief into rebellion, his fate forever entwined with Marian, a noblewoman torn between loyalty to her family and her love for him. As tensions rise, Rob gathers a band of outlaws around him -- men and women with little in common but their Saxon heritage and desire to fight tyranny. In Sherwood Forest, they wage war against corruption and injustice, drawing the ire of Sheriff, Barons, and Norman royalty alike. What begins as vengeance transforms into something far greater: the legend of Robin Hood, a symbol of defiance whose struggle will shape the fate of England itself.The Robin Hood series premieres Sunday, November 2 at 9:00 PM ET/PT in the U.S. with two episodes and new episodes will premiere weekly through the season finale on Sunday, December 28, 2025. Robin Hood will also be available to MGM+ viewers in the UK, Italy, Germany, Spain, Latin America, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg.ShareDid you enjoy this video?Leave feedbackIn This VideoRobin Hood [2025]MGM PlusNov 2, 2025Where to WatchPowered byNot yet available for streaming.Related0:30Reviews•Editor Columns•News•Guides•Upcoming Sales Events•How to Watch Guides•Board Game Reviews•GTA 5 Cheats•Best Streaming Bundles•IGN Store•Top Deals•Contact Us•IGN YouTube•HowLongToBeat•IGN TikTok•IGN Twitter•Map Genie•Eurogamer•Rock Paper Shotgun•VG247•Maxroll•Privacy Policy•Terms of Use
