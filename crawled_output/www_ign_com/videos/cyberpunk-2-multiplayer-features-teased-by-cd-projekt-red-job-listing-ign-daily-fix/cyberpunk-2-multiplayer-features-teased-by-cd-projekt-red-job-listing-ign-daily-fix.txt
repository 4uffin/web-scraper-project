Responsibilities would include developing and optimizing "multiplayer systems, including matchmaking." So it sounds like Cyberpunk 2 is going to include a multiplayer mode, possibly similar to the scrapped mode that was supposed to be post-launch content for Cyberpunk 2077. Cyberpunk 2 isn't supposed to go into full development until after The Witcher 4 is out the door, so it may be a long while before we hear more. In other news, Fortnite is going head-to-head with Roblox in the creator economy space, with Epic revealing plans to allow players to sell user-generated content. The real kicker: Epic is pushing incentives for creators to earn quite a bit more than they would with Roblox. And finally, more DLC content for Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds has leaked, thanks to some retailers selling copies early.ShareDid you enjoy this video?Leave feedbackIn This VideoCyberpunk 2CD Projekt Red North AmericaTBA+1 WishlistRelated5:046:314:555:246:265:355:487:535:244:263:515:445:214:184:104:256:053:414:30Reviews•Editor Columns•News•Guides•Upcoming Sales Events•How to Watch Guides•Board Game Reviews•GTA 5 Cheats•Best Streaming Bundles•IGN Store•Top Deals•Contact Us•IGN YouTube•HowLongToBeat•IGN TikTok•IGN Twitter•Map Genie•Eurogamer•Rock Paper Shotgun•VG247•Maxroll•Privacy Policy•Terms of Use
