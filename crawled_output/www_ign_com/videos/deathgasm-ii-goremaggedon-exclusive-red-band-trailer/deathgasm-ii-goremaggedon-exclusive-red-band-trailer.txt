But when he learns that NoizeQuest, a battle-of-the-bands competition, is coming to his town, he sees a shot at redemption - and maybe even a second chance with Medina. One problem: his drummer is missing an arm, and the rest of his band is, well... dead. Luckily, Brodie still has the pages of The Black Hymn, so raising his bandmates from the great beyond is just a riff away. But with every chord comes blood, guts, and the kind of apocalyptic chaos only Deathgasm can unleash.Reprising their iconic roles from the 2015 original are Milo Cawthorne as Brodie and Kimberley Crossman as Medina, alongside James Joshua Blake, Sam Berkley, and Daniel Cresswell. The sequel also introduces us to new characters played by Kieran Charnock, Harrison Keefe, and Maggie Nicole Robertson. Plus, metal musician Matthew Kiichi Heafy, of Grammy-nominated metal band Trivium, composed the film’s original score. Deathgasm II: Goremaggedon, the long-awaited sequel to Jason Lei Howden’s 2015 cult horror-comedy phenomenon Deathgasm, will have its World Premiere in competition at Fantastic Fest in Austin, Texas on September 21, before heading to Spain in October for its European Premiere at Sitges International Fantastic Film Festival. The film will have its Australian premiere at Monster Fest on October 11th before Brodie and Medina return home to New Zealand with exclusive special screenings at Terror-Fi Fest for Halloween. Deathgasm II: Goremaggedon will be released in USA and Canada by Raven Banner Releasing and in Australia and New Zealand by Umbrella Entertainment.ShareDid you enjoy this video?Leave feedbackIn This VideoDeathgasm II: GoremageddonRaven Banner EntertainmentTBAWhere to WatchPowered byNot yet available for streaming.Reviews•Editor Columns•News•Guides•Upcoming Sales Events•How to Watch Guides•Board Game Reviews•GTA 5 Cheats•Best Streaming Bundles•IGN Store•Top Deals•Contact Us•IGN YouTube•HowLongToBeat•IGN TikTok•IGN Twitter•Map Genie•Eurogamer•Rock Paper Shotgun•VG247•Maxroll•Privacy Policy•Terms of Use
