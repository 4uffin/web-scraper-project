This week Daemon, Logan, Max, and Ryan look back at the Nintendo Switch 2's first hundred days. The system is Nintendo's fastest-selling to date, with strong third-party support and a slate of upcoming first-party titles that should sustain the console's momentum through the holidays. But Nintendo has raised eyebrows with their game pricing strategy ($80 for Mario Kart World is nuts), and the tariff situation in the United States could threaten to slow down the Switch 2's impressive sales pace. Plus we have last week's poll results, and a new poll for you to vote on at IGN.com.ShareDid you enjoy this video?Leave feedbackIn This VideoDonkey Kong BananzaNintendo EPDJul 17, 2025Rate this gameRelated GuidesOverviewEssential Tips to Get StartedWalkthroughBest Skills to Get FirstRelated17:4113:2131:0812:1226:0716:0224:2627:2221:5026:3216:3522:4318:2927:4715:3332:2421:5130:4438:58Reviews•Editor Columns•News•Guides•Upcoming Sales Events•How to Watch Guides•Board Game Reviews•GTA 5 Cheats•Best Streaming Bundles•IGN Store•Top Deals•Contact Us•IGN YouTube•HowLongToBeat•IGN TikTok•IGN Twitter•Map Genie•Eurogamer•Rock Paper Shotgun•VG247•Maxroll•Privacy Policy•Terms of Use
