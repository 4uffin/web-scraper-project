It's been almost three decades since the rage virus escaped a biological weapons laboratory, and now, still in a ruthlessly enforced quarantine, some have found ways to exist amidst the infected. One such group of survivors lives on a small island connected to the mainland by a single, heavily-defended causeway. When one of the group leaves the island on a mission into the dark heart of the mainland, he discovers secrets, wonders, and horrors that have mutated not only the infected but other survivors as well.ProducersDNA Films, Decibel FilmsDistributorsColumbia PicturesFranchises28 Days Later / 28 Weeks LaterInitial ReleaseJun 20, 2025PlatformsGenresHorror28 Years Later NewsLatestVideosArticlesTrailersReviewsSep 8, 2025Sep 8, 2025 - Make no bones about it.28 Days LaterWesley Yin-Poole9Jul 29, 2025Jul 29, 2025 - Watch Danny Boyle's latest at home. 28 Years LaterBlythe Dujardin34Jul 4, 2025Jul 4, 2025 - Plus 28 Years Later is coming in a 4K Steelbook edition28 Years LaterChristian Wait1Jun 24, 2025Jun 24, 2025 - Final cut.28 Years LaterTom Phillips126:08Jun 23, 2025Jun 23, 202528 Years Later111:26Jun 23, 2025Jun 23, 202528 Years LaterCarlos Morales + 3 moreJun 23, 2025Jun 23, 2025 - "He's a kaleidoscope."28 Years LaterTom Phillips54Jun 22, 2025Jun 22, 2025 - Wide open space.28 Years LaterWesley Yin-Poole78Jun 22, 2025Jun 22, 2025 - Why are we so into the apocalypse?28 Years LaterJared Petty74Jun 21, 2025Jun 21, 2025 - What lurks beneath the surface?28 Years LaterJake Kleinman72Load MoreReviews•Editor Columns•News•Guides•Upcoming Sales Events•How to Watch Guides•Board Game Reviews•GTA 5 Cheats•Best Streaming Bundles•IGN Store•Top Deals•Contact Us•IGN YouTube•HowLongToBeat•IGN TikTok•IGN Twitter•Map Genie•Eurogamer•Rock Paper Shotgun•VG247•Maxroll•Privacy Policy•Terms of Use
