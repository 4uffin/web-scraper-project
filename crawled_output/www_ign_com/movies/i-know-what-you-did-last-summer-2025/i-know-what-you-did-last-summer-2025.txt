A year later, their past comes back to haunt them and they’re forced to confront a horrifying truth: someone knows what they did last summer…and is hell-bent on revenge. As one by one the friends are stalked by a killer, they discover this has happened before, and they turn to two survivors of the legendary Southport Massacre of 1997 for help.ProducersOriginal FilmDistributorsColumbia PicturesFranchisesI Know What You Did Last SummerInitial ReleaseJul 18, 2025PlatformsGenresThriller, HorrorI Know What You Did Last Summer [2025] NewsLatestVideosArticlesTrailersReviewsJul 24, 2025Jul 24, 2025 - Sink your hook into this 4K.I Know What You Did Last SummerHannah Hoolihan2Jul 16, 2025Jul 16, 2025 - Legacyquel won't get its hooks in you.I Know What You Did Last SummerEmma Stefansky1392:24Jun 17, 2025Jun 17, 2025I Know What You Did Last Summer111:56Apr 22, 2025Apr 22, 2025I Know What You Did Last Summer17Sep 16, 2014Sep 16, 2014 - Oculus' Mike Flanagan co-scripting.I Know What You Did Last SummerJim VejvodaReviews•Editor Columns•News•Guides•Upcoming Sales Events•How to Watch Guides•Board Game Reviews•GTA 5 Cheats•Best Streaming Bundles•IGN Store•Top Deals•Contact Us•IGN YouTube•HowLongToBeat•IGN TikTok•IGN Twitter•Map Genie•Eurogamer•Rock Paper Shotgun•VG247•Maxroll•Privacy Policy•Terms of Use
