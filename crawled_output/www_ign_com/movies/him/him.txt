On the eve of professional football's annual scouting Combine, Cam is attacked by an unhinged fan and suffers a potentially career-ending brain trauma.
Just when all seems lost, Cam receives a lifeline when his hero, Isaiah White (Marlon Wayans), a legendary eight-time Championship quarterback and cultural megastar, offers to train Cam at Isaiah's isolated compound that he shares with his celebrity influencer wife, Elsie White (Julia Fox). But as Cam's training accelerates, Isaiah's charisma begins to curdle into something darker, sending his protégé down a disorienting rabbit hole that may cost him more than he ever bargained for.ProducersMonkeypaw ProductionsDistributorsUniversal PicturesInitial ReleaseSep 19, 2025PlatformsGenresHorror, Sports, FootballHim NewsLatestVideosArticlesTrailersReviews6d ago6d ago - A sports horror movie that’s everything and nothing all at once.HimSiddhant Adlakha1861:15Aug 22, 2025Aug 22, 2025Him2:40Aug 6, 2025Aug 6, 2025Him131:50Apr 18, 2025Apr 18, 2025Him6Reviews•Editor Columns•News•Guides•Upcoming Sales Events•How to Watch Guides•Board Game Reviews•GTA 5 Cheats•Best Streaming Bundles•IGN Store•Top Deals•Contact Us•IGN YouTube•HowLongToBeat•IGN TikTok•IGN Twitter•Map Genie•Eurogamer•Rock Paper Shotgun•VG247•Maxroll•Privacy Policy•Terms of Use
