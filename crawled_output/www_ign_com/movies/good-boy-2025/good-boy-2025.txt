From the start, two things are abundantly clear: Indy is wary of the creepy old house, and his affection for Todd is unwavering. After moving in, Indy is immediately vexed by empty corners, tracks an invisible presence only he can see, perceives phantasmagoric warnings from a long-dead dog, and is haunted by visions of the previous occupant’s grim death. When Todd begins succumbing to the dark forces swirling around the house, Indy must battle a malevolence intent on dragging his beloved Todd into the afterlife.DistributorsIFC, ShudderInitial ReleaseOct 3, 2025PlatformsGenresThriller, HorrorGood Boy [2025] NewsLatestVideosTrailers1:004d ago4d agoGood Boy1:26Aug 18, 2025Aug 18, 2025 - Check out this unusual horror thriller told from the perspective of Indy the Dog.
