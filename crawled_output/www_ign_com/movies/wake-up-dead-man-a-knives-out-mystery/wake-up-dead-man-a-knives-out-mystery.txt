Wicks’s modest-but-devoted flock includes devout church lady Martha Delacroix (Glenn Close), circumspect groundskeeper Samson Holt (Thomas Haden Church), tightly-wound lawyer Vera Draven, Esq. (Kerry Washington), aspiring politician Cy Draven (Daryl McCormack), town doctor Nat Sharp (Jeremy Renner), best-selling author Lee Ross (Andrew Scott), and concert cellist Simone Vivane (Cailee Spaeny). After a sudden and seemingly impossible murder rocks the town, the lack of an obvious suspect prompts local police chief Geraldine Scott (Mila Kunis) to join forces with renowned detective Benoit Blanc to unravel a mystery that defies all logic.ProducersLionsgate, Netflix, T-StreetDistributorsNetflixFranchisesKnives OutInitial ReleaseNov 26, 2025PlatformsGenresMysteryWake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery Review7Review scoringgoodWake Up Dead Man is a solid third entry for Benoit Blanc, finally delivering the classic-style mystery the series has sorely needed.Carlos MoralesRead ReviewWake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery NewsLatestVideosArticlesTrailersReviews6d ago6d ago - Back to Blanc.Wake Up Dead ManCarlos Morales1122:0213d ago13d ago - In theaters on November 26 and streaming on Netflix on December 12.Wake Up Dead Man6Sep 2, 2025Sep 2, 2025 - That's what I call a Knives Out Mystery solved.
