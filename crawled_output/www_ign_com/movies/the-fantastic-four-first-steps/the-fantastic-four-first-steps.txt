Forced to balance their roles as heroes with the strength of their family bond, they must defend Earth from a ravenous space god called Galactus (Ralph Ineson) and his enigmatic Herald, Silver Surfer (Julia Garner).
And if Galactus' plan to devour the entire planet and everyone it weren't bad enough, it suddenly gets very personal.ProducersMarvel StudiosDistributorsWalt Disney Studios Motion PicturesFranchisesMarvel, Fantastic Four, MCU - Marvel Connected UniverseInitial ReleaseJul 25, 2025PlatformsGenresSuperhero, ActionThe Fantastic Four: First Steps NewsLatestVideosArticlesTrailersReviews1:243d ago3d agoThe Fantastic Four: First Steps24d ago4d ago - Dish the dirt.The Fantastic Four: First StepsTom Phillips130:28Aug 29, 2025Aug 29, 2025 - Watch The Fantastic Four: First Steps in theaters for Labor Day weekend.The Fantastic Four: First Steps5Aug 28, 2025Aug 28, 2025 - Reining in the Supermen.SupermanCarlos Morales343Aug 24, 2025Aug 24, 2025 - Up and away.SupermanWesley Yin-Poole293Aug 18, 2025Aug 18, 2025 - Kent up demand.Man of SteelWesley Yin-Poole241Aug 12, 2025Aug 12, 2025 - "We made three quarters of $1 billion, those two movies."Fantastic FourWesley Yin-Poole5316:28Aug 9, 2025Aug 9, 2025The Fantastic Four: First StepsSiddhant Adlakha271:18Aug 8, 2025Aug 8, 2025 - "Just trying to save my world you know."The Fantastic Four: First Steps251:03Aug 7, 2025Aug 7, 2025 - "That's what family is."The Fantastic Four: First Steps13Load MoreReviews•Editor Columns•News•Guides•Upcoming Sales Events•How to Watch Guides•Board Game Reviews•GTA 5 Cheats•Best Streaming Bundles•IGN Store•Top Deals•Contact Us•IGN YouTube•HowLongToBeat•IGN TikTok•IGN Twitter•Map Genie•Eurogamer•Rock Paper Shotgun•VG247•Maxroll•Privacy Policy•Terms of Use
