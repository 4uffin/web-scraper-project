A new report claims that Timothee Chalamet has been cast as Willy Wonka in Warner Bros.' upcoming Charlie and the Chocolate Factory prequel, Wonka. This will be the first film in which Chalamet, of Interstellar and Dune fame, will sing and dance. And finally, a Highlander remake is in the works at Lionsgate starring Henry Cavill. John Wick director, Chad Stahelski, is set to direct the film, although not much is known beyond that.HighlanderJoshua Yehl16May 21, 2021May 21, 2021 - You have done well, Cavill.
