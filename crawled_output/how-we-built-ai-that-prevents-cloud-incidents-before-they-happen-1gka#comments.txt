How We Built AI That Prevents Cloud Incidents Before They Happen

As a former cloud engineer at MITRE and Frontier Airlines, I spent too many nights fighting cloud fires. Surprise bills, compliance violations, security gaps — sound familiar?
After one too many 3 AM alerts, my team and I built PolicyCortex: an AI system that predicts and prevents cloud issues before they become incidents.
The Problem We Set Out to Solve
Traditional monitoring is reactive: you get alerts after something breaks. We wanted proactive intelligence that spots problems early and nudges safe fixes into the delivery flow.
Our AI Approach
We combine ML + policy-as-code + lightweight telemetry:
Cost: time-series models flag anomalous spend and predict upcoming spikes.
Security: configuration analytics uncover misconfigurations and risky drift.
Compliance: rules + drift detection prevent violations before they ship.
Performance: early signals (latency, saturation, errors) catch issues upstream.
Real Results (so far)
1,842 incidents prevented across customers
$2.4M+ in cloud costs saved
94.2% average compliance score achieved
$16K+ potential savings identified per customer
These numbers reflect current internal dashboards as of publication.
High-Level Architecture
Time-series forecasting for usage & cost patterns
Anomaly detection on security posture & access drift
Rule engine for policy/compliance guardrails (pre-deploy + runtime)
NLP prioritization to group noisy alerts into actionable stories
Under the hood, we pair proactive checks with gated deployments so risky changes don’t make it to prod. When something does slip, we provide clear flow maps and cheaper, summarized log views so engineers can see what’s talking to what without burning the budget.
Why This Matters
Fewer wake-ups: prevent incidents instead of paging on symptoms
Lower cloud bills: catch waste and misconfig early
Cleaner audits: show your preventative controls, not just post-mortems
Happier teams: less noise, clearer actions
What’s Next
We’re launching publicly today and would love feedback from the DEV community. The goal: eliminate reactive cloud management.
