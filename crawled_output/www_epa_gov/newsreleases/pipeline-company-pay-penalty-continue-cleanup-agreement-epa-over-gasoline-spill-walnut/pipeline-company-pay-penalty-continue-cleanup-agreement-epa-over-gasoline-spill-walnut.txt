SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. (September 23, 2025) – Today, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced a settlement with pipeline company SFPP, L.P. to resolve claims of Clean Water Act violations after the company's pipeline discharged over 40,000 gallons of gasoline into the environment in Walnut Creek, California. Under the agreement, SFPP will pay a penalty of $213,560.“Pipeline operators must be held accountable when they discharge gasoline into our environment,” said EPA Pacific Southwest Region Enforcement and Compliance Assurance Director Amy Miller. “This enforcement action sends a clear message: companies must properly operate and maintain their pipelines to prevent spills. EPA takes seriously the responsibility to protect our waters and communities from petroleum discharges.”In the settlement, EPA claims that SFPP discharged gasoline in such quantities as may be harmful. Under federal law, petroleum transporters must operate and maintain pipelines to ensure spills do not happen and, if they do occur, are immediately contained and do not pose a threat to the environment. SFPP is conducting ongoing cleanup work in coordination with the Regional Water Quality Control Board to address environmental impacts from the spill.Additional Information:Clean Water Act Spill Prevention, Control, and CountermeasureFor more information on reporting possible violations of environmental laws and regulations visit EPA’s enforcement reporting website.Learn about EPA’s Pacific Southwest Region.
