New York, N.Y. – Today, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. National Park Service (NPS) announced that they have reached a consent agreement that strengthens lead safety protections for employees and families living in 43 pre-1978 housing units at Gateway National Recreation Area, which extends across New York and New Jersey. The agreement requires NPS to strengthen its lead hazard disclosure practices, improve staff training and ensure safer renovations across its housing properties. “EPA’s job is to protect families and workers from lead hazards in paint and this agreement does exactly that,” said EPA Regional Administrator Michael Martucci. “It upholds the law, makes housing safer and avoids extra costs for the National Park Service as they care for our national parks.”Under the agreement, NPS will:Provide tenants with updated lead-based paint disclosures;Ensure certified staff and training for renovation work;Adopt clear procedures to identify and address hazards; andPrioritize testing in homes with young children and report annually to EPA.The settlement also includes an agreement to waive over $175,000 in penalties if the housing authority takes the actions necessary to follow federal lead requirements.Background:Lead paint was banned in 1978, but it remains on the walls and woodwork of millions of homes and buildings across the country. Exposure to improperly managed lead-based paint can cause serious health problems, especially in children. Federal law requires landlords and contractors to provide tenants with lead-paint hazard information and to use certified and trained personnel during renovations.Visit EPA’s lead webpage for more information on EPA’s lead programs and requirements.Follow EPA Region 2 on X, Instagram, and visit our Facebook page.
