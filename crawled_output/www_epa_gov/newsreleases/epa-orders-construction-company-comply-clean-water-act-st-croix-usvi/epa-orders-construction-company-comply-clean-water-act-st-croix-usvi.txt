St. Croix, USVI  – U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced that is has required Chitolie Trucking Service, LLC to comply with the Clean Water Act (CWA) after identifying deficiencies in how it manages wastewater and stormwater at its St. Croix facility. The violations were identified during joint inspections by EPA and the Virgin Islands Department of Planning and Natural Resources (DPNR) where the agencies identified unpermitted discharges of process wastewater and stormwater from the company’s industrial operations. The order requires the company to stop discharging pollutants into Cane Garden Bay and prevents repetition of the violations.   “Construction activities and facilities play a crucial role in local economies, but without proper controls, they can risk polluting nearby waterways,” said EPA Regional Administrator Michael Martucci. “EPA was glad to collaborate with the Virgin Islands Department of Planning and Natural Resources to safeguard the vital coastal water resources in the Caribbean.”   The facility was found to be discharging pollutants where ready-mix concrete is produced, and local trucking services are provided. Under EPA’s order, Chitolie Trucking Service, LLC must control its pollution in the short term and submit progress reports documenting the progress of actions taken to comply. In the longer term, they must obtain the necessary permits from DPNR, which will include required pollution controls. EPA and DPNR will help ensure that the company understands its obligations under environmental regulations and that it operates in a manner that protects local water quality.    For more details on EPA’s CWA permits check out EPA’s overviews of National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit and stormwater discharges from industrial activities.  Follow EPA Region 2 on X, Instagram, and visit our Facebook page.
