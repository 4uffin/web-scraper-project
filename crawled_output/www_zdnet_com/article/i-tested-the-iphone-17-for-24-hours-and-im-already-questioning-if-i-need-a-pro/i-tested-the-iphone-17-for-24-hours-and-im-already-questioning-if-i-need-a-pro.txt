I switched to the iPhone 17 full-time, and I'm already wondering if I need a Pro
You're getting Pro-level features while saving hundreds. That's a win for everyone.

Sabrina Ortiz/ZDNETFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google. ZDNET's key takeaways The iPhone 17 got major upgrades under the hood.At the $799 price point, users are getting Pro-level features.The iPhone 17 is available for purchase in-store starting Friday.Typically, base model iPhones are often overlooked. Apple's launch of the iPhone 17 lineup made that even more the case, with the ultra-thin iPhone Air and the Cosmic Orange iPhone 17 Pro stealing all the attention. However, some time with the iPhone 17 and a look at the specs make it evident that it's the biggest win of the product season for most users.While at a glance it may look the same as last year, in different, dare I say, cuter pastel colors, after using it for a couple of minutes, you'll be able to tell that it packs major upgrades under the hood. The best part is that, despite the upgrades, it retails for the same price as last year's model, with the same storage at $799.
Also: T-Mobile will give you a free iPhone 17 Pro - here's how to qualifyTo help you decide if a trip to the Apple store on Friday is worth it, I am sharing the iPhone 17's biggest standouts (and upgrades), which I noticed after spending 24 hours with the phone.

The latest base-model iPhone features upgrades in meaningful ways, from the display refresh rate to storage to cameras.

1. The display upgrade we've been waiting for
Sabrina Ortiz/ZDNETWith the iPhone 17, Apple finally made the 120Hz ProMotion display, which was typically limited to Pro users, uniform across the entire lineup, even the base model. If you are coming from a previous iPhone base model and are not accustomed to higher refresh rate displays, you are in for a treat. Trust me, while subtle, you will notice the difference. Meanwhile, if you are coming from the Pro models, you won't notice a difference, with the same buttery smooth experience.
Also: Apple iPhone 17 Pro Max vs. Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra: I compared both, and here's who winsAs someone who has always purchased the Pro lineup, I had forgotten how spoiled I was by the 120Hz refresh rate until I tested the iPhone 16e and had to readjust to a 60Hz refresh rate, which was noticeably more stuttery and laggy. I am sure users who use the iPhone 17 and try to go back to prior models will have a similar experience. In addition to the refresh rate, the phone now includes thinner borders with a slightly larger 6.3-inch display, which also happens to have 3,000 nits peak outdoor brightness, the highest ever on the base model. In my limited time using it, I didn't have to strain while looking at my phone in direct sunlight. A display upgrade that is harder to spot or test is Ceramic Shield 2, which Apple claims gives it three times better scratch resistance.
2. A selfie camera that you can't go wrong with
Sabrina Ortiz/ZDNETThe iPhone 17 has an 18MP Center Stage front camera, an upgrade from the prior year's 12MP. While this directly translates to better-quality selfies, the real magic relates to its wider field of view. Now, you can switch from landscape to portrait mode without rotating the phone, as seen in the photo above. I am holding my phone vertically while taking a horizontal photo.
Also: I'm a long-time iPhone Pro user, but I'm seriously considering the Air for these reasonsYou can manually toggle the orientation, or, using AI, the camera can automatically widen the shot when it detects a group of people and rotate from landscape to vertical to get everyone in the frame. Using it for the first time feels a bit like magic, and while not the flashiest feature, it is wildly convenient. The rear cameras got a slight boost, too, with a 48MP Fusion main and a 48MP Fusion ultra wide replacing the 12MP ultra wide found on the iPhone 16.
3. Better value than you expect
Sabrina Ortiz/ZDNETTypically, Apple has always offered a 128GB tier of storage, but this year it is starting all of its phones at 256GB. So, while at face value it may seem like the iPhone 17 is $100 more expensive than the iPhone 16, retailing at $799, it is actually the same price as the iPhone 16 with 256GB. For someone like me who loves to take photos of absolutely everything, having a minimum of 256GB has always been a requirement, and in the age of digital hoarding, I think most users will be able to reap the benefits, too.
This is especially a treat considering that, in addition to the upgrades mentioned above, the iPhone 17 also has an A19 chipset and a better battery with up to 30 hours of video playback. Not only is this a good deal, but the phone's specs make it likely the best phone for most users, especially now that the gap between the base and Pro models has closed even further. Also: Verizon will give you an iPhone 17 Pro for free right now - how to qualify for the dealAt this point, I'd say shelling out the extra $300 for the iPhone 17 Pro is most likely only worth it if you are an avid photographer or an absolute power user who needs the power boost from a bigger battery, vapor chamber, and A19 Pro chip.
