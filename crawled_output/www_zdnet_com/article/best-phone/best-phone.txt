If the phone launches during the first half of 2025 are anything to go by, we're in for a wild ride to end the year. The OnePlus 13 set the tone early, followed by the Galaxy S25 series and, more recently, Apple released the public beta of iOS 26, which introduces a fresh software design. In just a few more weeks, we'll learn more about Google's Pixel 10 series, which is expected to feature a whopping five phone models, so stay tuned.Fact of the matter is, there are tons of phones shouting for your attention. When you're picking one, really think about what you need day-to-day. The best options on the market feature displays that can beat the outdoor sun, cameras that capture great photos in the most difficult lighting environments, and software features that truly enhance your communication and productivity.What is the best smartphone right now?After extensive testing of dozens of devices, our pick for the best phone overall is the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, thanks to its immersive and vibrant display, reliable battery life, and wealth of special features, some of which are powered by the company's latest generative artificial intelligence (AI) model. It's not cheap at a starting price of $1,299, but our testing found it to be worth the money, especially if you can snag a carrier deal or trade-in promotion. Apple's iPhone 16 Pro Max is a close second, with a thinner and larger design, a Camera Control key for precision capturing, and a suite of ever-improving Apple Intelligence features.Of course, our pick for the best phone overall may not be the best for you. No matter which option on this list you decide to invest in, expect it to be high-performing, have a display that is bright enough to use outdoors, and have a camera system that will fulfill your photography needs.Also: The best Android phones to buy in 2025

View now at AmazonView now at SamsungView now at Walmart Why we like it: The Galaxy S25 Ultra stands out as the premier handset so far in 2025 with its sophisticated integration of Galaxy AI and arsenal of hardware features. The latest Galaxy AI suite brings practical and useful features like real-time call translation, voice commands that work across multiple apps, and photo editing capabilities. Real-world testing suggests these AI functions surpass those on competing Android devices in speed, dependability, and overall usefulness. Beyond the AI, the phone has impressed us with its large 6.9-inch, anti-reflective, AMOLED display and robust 5,000mAh battery. Performance is bolstered by the upgraded Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset and 12GB of RAM, further enhanced by a larger cooling chamber ideal for multimedia and gaming. The smartphone also excels in durability with its lightweight titanium frame and new resilient Corning Gorilla Armor 2 glass. Furthermore, the camera system is significantly upgraded with a 50MP ultrawide lens that captures landscape and macro shots with greater detail and vibrancy. We've run several camera tests between the S25 Ultra and competing phones like the iPhone 16 Pro Max and Google Pixel 9 Pro XL and found the Samsung model to deliver the sharpest and vibrant imagery.Review: Samsung Galaxy S25 UltraWho it's for: The Galaxy S25 Ultra is primarily targeted towards users who demand the best smartphone experience Samsung can provide and are keen to explore the latest consumer-facing AI features. It represents a particularly compelling upgrade for individuals holding onto three to four-year-old devices, offering significant advancements across the board. The strong build makes it an excellent choice for those who prioritize device protection against everyday mishaps. Multimedia enthusiasts will appreciate the large, anti-reflective, 6.9-inch screen combined with enhanced cooling technology. Additionally, photography lovers looking for improved detail and color in wide-angle and close-up macro shots will find the new 50MP ultrawide camera valuable.Who should look elsewhere: Despite its strengths, the Galaxy S25 Ultra's $1,300 price point makes it out of reach for budget-conscious consumers. In addition, users who frequently utilize the S Pen's Bluetooth gestures for actions like remotely triggering the camera may be disappointed, as the functionality has been removed. Furthermore, individuals who prefer a less angular or "boxy" phone design might find the standard Galaxy S25 or S25 Plus models more aesthetically pleasing and comfortable to hold. If you prefer a less bloated software experience, consider the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL or OnePlus 13, both of which also cost less than the Ultra.Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra specs: Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy | Display size: 6.9 inches | Storage options: Up to 1TB | Rear cameras: 200MP main, 50MP ultrawide, 50MP telephoto with 5x zoom, 10MP telephoto with 3x zoom | Front camera: 12MP | Battery: 5,000mAh | Price: Starting at $1,300

View now at Best Buy Why we like it: The iPhone 16 Pro Max cements its position as Apple's pinnacle smartphone offering over the last year, delivering a comprehensive package for the premium user. Its standout feature is arguably the expansive and brilliant 6.9-inch AMOLED display, ideal for immersive media consumption and mobile productivity alike. The 2024 model introduce a noticeable design change with thinner bezels that enhance the larger screen feel, alongside the addition of the new Camera Control button. This physical switch allows for quick camera access and photo capturing without screen interaction, a feature ZDNET Editor-in-Chief Jason Hiner suggested "is going to be super handy for people who take a ton of photos with the iPhone."The latest A18 Pro chip drives the phone's performance, which our testing found to yield significantly faster and more efficient on-device AI processing. This is a key capability setting the stage for the various Apple Intelligence tools. This AI suite promises advanced tools like image generation, a more capable Siri, and notification summaries, positioning the 16 Pro Max as Apple's most "future-proof" device for the AI era. Camera capabilities are also further enhanced with 4K video recording at 120fps, enabling high-detail slow-motion editing, and Audio Mix technology to isolate and clarify voices in recordings. An improved battery life, rated by Apple for 33 hours of video playback -- up from 29 hours, and newly added support for 25W MagSafe wireless charging round out the significant hardware upgrades.Review: iPhone 16 Pro MaxWho it's for: The iPhone 16 Pro Max is squarely aimed at users demanding the most advanced features and capabilities available within the Apple ecosystem. It represents a compelling choice for individuals eager to explore Apple Intelligence features, which require a more modernized and powerful chipset like the A18 Pro. Photography and videography enthusiasts will find significant value in the new Camera Control button for quick captures, the high-frame-rate 4K video for creative flexibility, and the Audio Mix feature for clearer sound.Furthermore, power users who rely heavily on their device throughout the day will appreciate the substantial battery life improvement. The large, high-quality 6.9-inch display makes it ideal for those who consume a lot of video content, play graphics-intensive games, or use their phone extensively for productivity tasks. It's also the go-to for users upgrading from older iPhone models -- particularly pre-Pro Max generations -- seeking the biggest leaps in screen size, performance, and camera tech.Who should look elsewhere: The iPhone 16 Pro Max's $1,200 starting price could deter budget-conscious consumers, who might find better value in the standard iPhone 16 models or competitive Android offerings. Users who aren't heavily invested in the Apple ecosystem or prefer the customization and file management flexibility of Android should consider alternatives like the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra or Google Pixel 9 Pro XL.Additionally, individuals who find large phones unwieldy might prefer a smaller device, even within Apple's own lineup.Also: Best password manager for iPhoneiPhone 16 Pro Max tech specs: Processor: A18 Pro | Display size: 6.9 inches | Storage options: Up to 1TB | Rear cameras: 48MP main, 12MP ultrawide, 12MP telephoto (2x), 12MP telephoto (5x) | Front camera: 12MP

View now at AmazonView now at SamsungView now at Best Buy Why we like it: The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 is the best foldable phone going into the rest of 2025, thanks to its ultra-thin form factor and market-leading camera system, which captures more lifelike images than competing models from OnePlus and Google, based on our tests. Samsung took the traditional smartphone route when refining the outer display of the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7, opting for a wider, more regular aspect ratio panel than last year's narrower Galaxy Z Fold 6. That makes a notable difference in hand-feel and ergonomics, even though the two phones are only $100 apart. Compared to the standard slab-style phone, you're simply getting more screen with the Z Fold 7, with a larger 8-inch display when unfolded. For reference, most modern-day phones range from 6 to 6.8 inches.Naturally, all the content I've been consuming on the phone, like video streaming, social media feeds, and Google Maps, is portrayed in a highly consumable manner; nothing feels disorienting or cropped out. While the foldable doesn't match its Ultra sibling spec-for-spec, the Z Fold 7 truly shines and more than makes up for the "inferior" 200MP camera system in long exposure shots and selfies, thanks to its self-standing nature. Review: Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7Who it's for: I often recommend the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold over other foldables because of Samsung's feature-rich approach to software. Running on the OneUI launcher (over Android 16) means you can expect a simple yet customizable user interface, with support for up to seven years of operating system and security updates. I can't say the same for the OnePlus Open or Motorola Razr.This ultra-slim form factor is also ideal for multitaskers and other users who want to see as much information at once as possible without reaching for a tablet or laptop. You simply won't find a foldable with better ergonomics right now than this.Who should look elsewhere: With a starting price tag of $1,999, you're mostly paying for the innovation factor with this phone. So if you're more interested in a safe and reliable handset that's arguably much easier to repair, then I'd recommend a traditional slab phone like the Samsung Galaxy S25 series instead.Users shopping for a foldable phone should consider the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold if they prefer a handset with less bloatware and a stubbier design, or last year's Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 if they want S Pen stylus support, which the Z Fold 7 omits.Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 tech specs: Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite | Display sizes: 6.5-inch exterior and 8-inch interior | Storage options: 256GB, 512GB, or 1TB | Rear cameras: 200MP wide, 12MP ultrawide, 10MP telephoto | Front cameras: 10MP front | Battery: 4,400mAh | Price: Starting at $1,999

View now at Us.nothing Why we like it: The CMF Phone 2 Pro is a top contender for the best cheap phone available today, offering remarkable value at just $279. It distinguishes itself from competitors, even those costing significantly more, with unique design features focused on user control and customization. Among these is the ability to easily swap back covers, attach screw-in accessories like kickstands or wallets, and expand storage via a MicroSD card -- a feature increasingly rare in modern smartphones.Impressively, the Phone 2 Pro avoids major compromises on essential specifications often seen at this price point. Our testing found the 3,000-nit OLED display to be notably bright, ensuring comfortable outdoor visibility. This also represents a significant upgrade from the previous model with improved contrast and color reproduction ideal for media. The large 5,000mAh battery delivers solid endurance for most users, enough to comfortably last our reviewers a day of usage. Furthermore, Nothing's streamlined interpretation of Android is a highlight, offering a thoughtful, bloatware-light experience enriched with unique widgets that enhance usability without unnecessary clutter.Review: CMF Phone 2 Pro Who it's for: This device primarily targets budget-conscious buyers seeking the best possible features and experience without breaking the bank. Its unique customization options, including the swappable backs and accessory system, make it perfect for users who enjoy personalizing their tech. The MicroSD card slot is a major draw for anyone needing ample, affordable storage expansion on top of the base 256GB configuration.The CMF Phone 2 Pro is also an excellent choice for users who prioritize a clean software experience and appreciate the distinctive design elements of Nothing OS. For individuals whose primary phone usage involves browsing, social media, messaging, and media consumption, the bright display, reliable battery life, and adequate performance deliver a satisfying daily experience well beyond what its price tag might suggest.Who should look elsewhere: Users who engage in frequent, graphics-intensive gaming or heavy multitasking may find the MediaTek Dimensity 7300 Pro processor underpowered. A device with a stronger chipset would be more suitable. While the camera system is competent for the price and includes a telephoto lens, its performance in low-light conditions lags behind competitors, making it less ideal for those prioritizing photography in challenging environments. The Google Pixel 9a might be a better fit here.Most importantly, potential buyers must be aware of its network limitations. The CMF Phone 2 Pro lacks the necessary band support for use on the Verizon network in the US.. For those needing Verizon compatibility, stronger performance, or better low-light camera capabilities within the budget segment, alternatives like the Motorola Moto G Power 2025 or the Google Pixel 9a should be considered.CMF Phone 2 Pro by Nothing tech specs: Display size: 6.77 inches | Display type: OLED | Resolution: 2780 x 1264 | Refresh rate: 120Hz | Battery life: 5,000mAh | RAM: 8GB | Storage: 256GB | Rear camera: 50MP main, 8MP ultra-wide, 50MP telephoto | Front camera: 16MP | Processor: MediaTek Dimensity 7300 Pro

CMF Phone 2 Pro by Nothing Best budget phone

Why we like it: The CMF Phone 2 Pro is a top contender for the best cheap phone available today, offering remarkable value at just $279. It distinguishes itself from competitors, even those costing significantly more, with unique design features focused on user control and customization. Among these is the ability to easily swap back covers, attach screw-in accessories like kickstands or wallets, and expand storage via a MicroSD card -- a feature increasingly rare in modern smartphones.Impressively, the Phone 2 Pro avoids major compromises on essential specifications often seen at this price point. Our testing found the 3,000-nit OLED display to be notably bright, ensuring comfortable outdoor visibility. This also represents a significant upgrade from the previous model with improved contrast and color reproduction ideal for media. The large 5,000mAh battery delivers solid endurance for most users, enough to comfortably last our reviewers a day of usage. Furthermore, Nothing's streamlined interpretation of Android is a highlight, offering a thoughtful, bloatware-light experience enriched with unique widgets that enhance usability without unnecessary clutter.Review: CMF Phone 2 Pro Who it's for: This device primarily targets budget-conscious buyers seeking the best possible features and experience without breaking the bank. Its unique customization options, including the swappable backs and accessory system, make it perfect for users who enjoy personalizing their tech. The MicroSD card slot is a major draw for anyone needing ample, affordable storage expansion on top of the base 256GB configuration.The CMF Phone 2 Pro is also an excellent choice for users who prioritize a clean software experience and appreciate the distinctive design elements of Nothing OS. For individuals whose primary phone usage involves browsing, social media, messaging, and media consumption, the bright display, reliable battery life, and adequate performance deliver a satisfying daily experience well beyond what its price tag might suggest.Who should look elsewhere: Users who engage in frequent, graphics-intensive gaming or heavy multitasking may find the MediaTek Dimensity 7300 Pro processor underpowered. A device with a stronger chipset would be more suitable. While the camera system is competent for the price and includes a telephoto lens, its performance in low-light conditions lags behind competitors, making it less ideal for those prioritizing photography in challenging environments. The Google Pixel 9a might be a better fit here.Most importantly, potential buyers must be aware of its network limitations. The CMF Phone 2 Pro lacks the necessary band support for use on the Verizon network in the US.. For those needing Verizon compatibility, stronger performance, or better low-light camera capabilities within the budget segment, alternatives like the Motorola Moto G Power 2025 or the Google Pixel 9a should be considered.CMF Phone 2 Pro by Nothing tech specs: Display size: 6.77 inches | Display type: OLED | Resolution: 2780 x 1264 | Refresh rate: 120Hz | Battery life: 5,000mAh | RAM: 8GB | Storage: 256GB | Rear camera: 50MP main, 8MP ultra-wide, 50MP telephoto | Front camera: 16MP | Processor: MediaTek Dimensity 7300 Pro

View now at AmazonView now at Motorola Why we like it: Deciding on the best flip-style foldable phone came down to the wire, with Motorola's Razr Ultra just scraping by Samsung's Galaxy Z Flip 7. I went hands-on with the new Razr Ultra model earlier this year, and was thoroughly impressed by the improved hinge system (read: the phone feels sturdier to flip open and close), as well as the performance, which is underpinned by an updated Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset and 12GB of RAM.Motorola's outer display still supports virtually any app you throw at it, meaning you can browse the web, play games, scroll TikTok, and do other mobile tasks without ever needing to flip open the device. Samsung's platform is more limited in this regard, which always felt like a missed opportunity when testing.It also helps that the Razr Ultra has a textured backing, including new Alcantara and Wood finishes, which I've found to be easier to hold and grip than competing flip phones. Considering how fragile these foldable devices can be -- anything with so many moving parts typically are -- the enhanced grip is easy to appreciate.Review: Motorola Razr Ultra (2025)Who it's for: At $1,299, the Razr Ultra is not a cheap flip phone by any means. That's why its more affordable siblings, the Razr and Razr Plus exist. But if you want the most complete, durable, and visually-stimulating flip phone on the market right now, you'll have to pay to play with the Razr Ultra.I applauded Motorola for exploring new color and material finishes with this year's Razr, and that's something fashion-forward users will likely favor too. The battery on this year's model -- 4,700mAh, up from 4,000mAh -- is also much larger, which you can never really complain about.Who should look elsewhere: When buying the Razr Ultra, you should also consider aspects like Motorola's relatively short software update cadence, which ranges from 2 to 3 years, versus Google and Samsung's 7 years. If you're looking for a phone that's even more forgiving when dropped, I'd invest in a traditional slab handset instead, like the Samsung Galaxy S25 series or iPhone 16 Pro series.Motorola Razr Ultra (2025) tech specs: Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite | Display sizes: 4-inch exterior and 7-inch interior | Storage options: 512GB, 1TB | Cameras: 50MP wide, 50MP ultrawide, 32MP front | Battery: 4,700mAh | Price: $1,299

View now at AmazonView now at Best Buy Why we like it: The Google Pixel 9 Pro series -- comprising the $800 Pixel 9 Pro and $900 Pro XL -- consistently sets the standard for computational photography in the smartphone market. While flagship cameras from Apple and Samsung are impressive, we've found Google's system frequently excels, particularly demonstrating superior shutter speed for capturing fast action, nuanced post-processing, and natural-looking color accuracy compared to rivals like the Galaxy S25 Ultra and iPhone 16 Pro Max. This results in photos that are balanced in color and generally satisfying to view.Both Pro models feature the same, highly capable and reliable triple-lens setup -- 50MP main, 48MP ultrawide, 48MP 5x telephoto -- adept at capturing everything from wide vistas to distant subjects like statues and buildings with clarity. I've taken the Pro XL with me to several product events across the country, and the camera system has been very reliable. This hardware is further enhanced by clever software features like Google's Super Res Zoom --offering usable shots up to 30x, 8K video upscaling, and the more recent "Add Me" feature for merging two photos -- perfect for group shots without needing someone else to take the picture. The phones are powered by the latest Tensor G4 chip, which powers features like Magic Editor, Photo Unblur, and Best Take, to allow users to effortlessly rescue or creatively enhance nearly any shot, making post-processing incredibly versatile.Review: Google Pixel 9 Pro XLWho it's for: The Pixel 9 Pro and Pro XL are primarily designed for users who prioritize a best-in-class mobile photography experience, valuing reliable point-and-shoot results, accurate color representation, and the ability to cleanly capture challenging, fast-moving subjects. It's the ideal choice for individuals keen on utilizing cutting-edge AI tools to easily edit and perfect their photos after capture. Value-conscious buyers looking for flagship camera performance without the absolute top-tier pricing of Apple or Samsung's highest models will find the Pixel 9 Pro series particularly appealing. Furthermore, users who frequently utilize zoom capabilities for distant objects or appreciate the clean software experience and unique AI features synonymous with the Google ecosystem are prime candidates for these devices.Who should look elsewhere: Despite its photographic strengths, the Pixel 9 Pro series may not be the perfect fit for everyone. Users whose primary focus is videography, requiring the absolute best image stabilization and motion smoothing capabilities, should consider the iPhone 16 Pro Max, which I still fall back on for recording content.

It's complemented by market-leading 80W wired charging capable of a full charge in under 30-40 minutes and rapid 50W wireless charging. Durability is another strength, featuring an impressive IP69 rating for resistance against high-pressure, high-temperature water jets and humidity, along with Ceramic Guard screen protection. Additions like an improved ultrasonic fingerprint sensor, unique design options including vegan leather backs, helpful screen features like Glove Mode, and the signature Alert Slider round out a compelling hardware package supporting a capable triple 50MP camera system.Review: OnePlus 13Who it's for: The OnePlus 13 is tailor-made for users seeking flagship-level performance, particularly in battery life and charging speeds, without the price tag. Its exceptional endurance and rapid charging make it ideal for heavy users and those always on the go. The robust IP69 rating appeals to individuals needing a phone that can withstand more demanding environments than typical IP68-rated devices. Performance enthusiasts will appreciate the smooth operation driven by the Snapdragon 8 Elite and an ample 16GB of RAM. It's also a great fit for users who prefer a less AI-saturated software experience compared to some competitors, or those who appreciate OnePlus's distinct design philosophy and the tactile convenience of the Alert Slider, though that feature is reportedly being revamped soon.Who should look elsewhere: Despite its numerous strengths, the OnePlus 13 may not be the perfect choice for everyone. Users who prioritize purchasing through major U.S. carrier stores might find availability less convenient compared to Samsung or Google devices. While OnePlus offers a solid update policy of four years of OS updates up to Android 19 and six years of security, those seeking longer software support should try Google or Samsung flagships.

Android vs iOS: How to decide
Android:Google's operating system has always been about personalization, app freedom, and flexible use cases. For example, dozens of Android manufacturers launch phones annually, while iOS runs only on Apple's iPhone, which releases two models yearly. Naturally, there are more Android app developers, niche software and services, and form factors that go beyond the glass slab.Pros:Customization: While the latest iPhone software, iOS 26, is the most customizable version yet, Android is still ahead in modifying settings, looks and appearance, and more. You can adjust settings on a per-app basis, install third-party launchers, icon packs, and other services, and even tweak system animations to make the operating system faster.App variety: According to AppExperts, there are over 3.5 million Android apps on the Google Play Store and more than 1.8 million apps on the iOS App Store. That's a big difference in volume that ultimately impacts users who desire more niche and specific apps for work and play. For example, while both platforms will carry services like WhatsApp and Instagram, Android usually has the upper hand with companion apps for consumer products, unreleased APKs, and more. There's also free access to sideload apps from third-party stores -- that process is exclusive to European users as far as iOS is concerned.Price and availability: Both Android and iOS are offered across the mid-to-high price tiers, but the former goes a step further with options that cater to budget-oriented shoppers. If you're shopping for a smartphone for less than $300, unless you're willing to buy a second-hand iPhone that's already a few generations old, Android handsets are your best option. Android phones also come in foldable form factors, from clamshell-style devices like the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 to book-style ones like the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold.Cons:Security and privacy: The abundance of Android phones and app makers means there are more opportunities for cybercriminals to access your personal information and/or install malware. How these attacks are prevented and managed also varies across manufacturers, with some OEMs like Google doing a better job than others like Xiaomi.Inconsistency with quality: Like security and privacy, you must always consider which Android maker you're buying a phone from and what it offers across different price ranges. Larger legacy brands like Samsung have a greater reputation for quality assurance and value. In contrast, smaller, newer brands like Nothing and OnePlus must prove themselves, sometimes taking risks that backfire in the process.iOS:The iPhone's operating system remains one of the most robust and closed in on the market, with unique features that only amplify the Apple hardware experience. Whether you're using an older or newer iPhone, iOS offers superior feature parity across generations than Android, with extended software support being one of its biggest benefits.Pros:Exclusive, ecosystem-based services: Strength in numbers is the name of the game for iOS, with the operating system notorious for its exclusive apps and services, such as iMessage and FaceTime, which make switching away from the iPhone more difficult than it should be. It helps that Apple has surrounded the iPhone with hardware and software that work harmoniously with iOS, including AirDropping files into a MacBook, pulling health data from an Apple Watch, and, just recently, supporting hearing aid tests via AirPods Pro 2.Quality of apps: Beyond the first-party apps, US developers often spend more time creating and optimizing iOS apps than Android apps due to the percentage of users. Naturally, services like Snapchat, Instagram, and TikTok function more fluidly on iOS than on Android.Longevity: When you buy a new iPhone, expect upwards of seven years of software support. While Android makers like Google and Samsung have begun to match Apple's software update policy, the Cupertino tech giant remains the most consistent and reliable, regardless of the model. For reference, Samsung has a better track record of updating its flagship phones than its midrange phones.Cons:Restrictive experience: Apple has loosened its grip on customizability over the years, with last year's iOS 18 update finally allowing users to freely place apps and widgets anywhere on the home screen grid. However, compared to Android, the iPhone software still has a ways to go. For example, you still can't customize notification types at a per-app level, set navigation gestures beyond swiping from the left side to go back, or download third-party app icons.Poor file management: If you've ever downloaded an image from the web on an iPhone, you'll know just how cumbersome it can be to locate that file later on. Sometimes, downloaded photos and videos will be directed into the file manager app first, requiring further action to fully migrate them into the Photos app.

Factors to consider when choosing a phone
The process of making our phone selections includes real-world testing and researching about the phones for weeks, consulting with colleagues, industry experts, and analysts who also have hands-on experience with the smartphones, and then selecting the best from all of the available choices. Ultimately, we weigh in the following aspects when curating this list:Design: There's only so much you can do with a slab design, but size differences, material choices, color options, and even the ability to bend a screen in half give shoppers enough diversity to have a preference. That's why we have a recommendation for every form factor.Performance: For many, smartphones are the center of our lives, which means the best ones are performant and can handle most, if not all, tasks you throw at them.Camera: Arguably the most valuable feature of a smartphone; the consistency and reliability of a camera system can make or break the overall mobile experience. We test every device in broad daylight and in the darkest of nights when finalizing this list.Battery: Every option in this guide should last you at least a day of moderate use. We also consider what devices support fast charging and/or wireless charging.Value: Price points are noted, but the most important thing with buying a phone is getting your money's worth. With these picks, you can rest assured that you're getting the best bang for your buck.

How we test phones
ZDNET's review team spends upwards of a year testing the ins and outs of every major phone release, evaluating the day-to-day performance, camera quality, battery life and endurance, and special features. Here's a breakdown of every factor we consider before we make recommendations:Design and ergonomics: How good a phone looks and feels plays a big role in many users' buying journeys, so we consider these aspects heavily when testing.Performance: Several factors affect a phone's performance, including LTE/5G signal, battery life, and background tasks. Therefore, we typically begin our evaluations with a fully charged handset, with all background tasks closed, and with as stable of a mobile connection as possible.Camera quality: ZDNET tests phone cameras by capturing hundreds of photos and videos of various subjects and in various lighting conditions. We also compare the output to that of older models.Battery life and charging: It's also important for us to evaluate how long phones last under light, moderate, and heavy usage, how long they take to recharge, and how they do it -- wired, wireless, or both. Special features: These features distinguish tested devices from a bustling smartphone market and hopefully bring added value to users, not the opposite.Pricing and availability: Beyond budget considerations, we also note if a phone is available in the US or only internationally.For a more extensive breakdown, check out our comprehensive phone testing methodology page.

You can do this by turning on Developer Options, a backend catalog of system settings meant for developers to access, but rules were meant to be broken, right? To turn on Developer Options, go into your About Phone page in the settings and look for the Build Number. Tap on that seven times and you should see a pop-up indicating that Developer Options has been turned on. Now, the activated tab will appear in the main settings list. From within, scroll down until you find Windows, Transition, and Animator duration scale. Tap into each and switch from the 1x default setting to .5x to double the speed of your phone's animations.Optimizing your battery healthTo preserve your phone's battery life, it's best to charge it between 20% and 80% and never let it drop to 0% or charge fully to 100%. This is because the heat generated from overcharging the phone can burn -- or degrade -- the battery, reducing its number of charge cycles. This phenomenon is the reason why you shouldn't charge your phone overnight or leave it plugged in for an extended period of time.When in doubt, after a year or two of usage, consider getting your phone's battery swapped to refresh its charge cycles. You'll be amazed at how well it functions again.How to keep your phone cleanUnless you're invested in a repairs and warranty plan like Apple Care, consider suiting your phone with a protective case and/or tempered glass screen protector. Beyond drop protection, the two accessories will prevent the phone from getting scratches, scuffs, and other blemishes and can greatly reduce the chance of water damage. For what it's worth, if a manufacturer claims its phone is rated IP68, that means the device can withstand dust ingress and be submerged in water for up to 30 minutes at one meter deep.Occasionally, take an alcohol pad and give your phone a wipe-down. If you think about it, your phone is just as likely to accumulate germs as your hands, so don't forget to clean it.

What's new with iOS 26?
If you're an iPhone user, the upcoming software version, iOS 26, introduces a slew of new features and design changes to be excited about. In fact, if you're open to testing Apple's public beta version, you can sign up for that (with an eligible iPhone model) right now.Also: The iOS 26 public beta is out now - how to install (and which iPhones support it)With iOS 26, the biggest feature is arguably Apple's Liquid Glass design language, which applies a level of transparency and fluidness across buttons, settings menus, and other interfaces. Apple says the new UI is inspired by VisionOS, which powers the brand's XR headset and should invoke a sense of natural motion and smoothness.Some more practical iOS features include Hold Assist in the revamped Phone app, more customizations in Messages, a more functional CarPlay experience, and Live Translation across various popular apps.

Which phone is best for money?
Besides the ones listed above, the OnePlus 13R is another great pick for the money. At $600, the device features a large 6.7-inch display with 120Hz refresh rate, a 50MP main camera system, a 6,000mAh battery that beats that of higher-cost devices, and 80W wired charging. The real kicker is OnePlus' aggressive trade-in offer, with the company discounting $100 when you turn in any phone in any condition, effectively bringing the 13R's price down to $500.

Which phone has the best camera?
Whether the iPhone 16 Pro Max, Google Pixel 9 Pro, and Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra are the best is debatable. For long-distance shots, Samsung's 200MP rear camera with 100x Space Zoom can capture subjects as far out as the moon. Google's Pixel phones have always been at the top for point-and-shoot pictures and a rather simplified, but effective, camera experience. If you're a videographer at heart, then the iPhone 16 Pro Max, with the ability to record 4K videos at 120 frames per second and a new Camera Control button, is an excellent tool to get the shots you need.

How long should a phone battery last?
The average phone battery lasts about 22 hours on a full charge, which is great for staying connected on commutes, work flights, and evenings at home. But that's just the average. Actual use time varies by phone model, battery capacity, the power efficiency of its processor, and what you're using your phone for. For example, the latest iPhone 16 Pro Max boasts a 32-hour battery life. But you'll get less than that if you habitually scroll through social media or stream video and music.

How much storage should my phone have?
Most smartphones have a base storage capacity of 128GB, which is plenty of space for average users to download apps and music, take photos, and shoot videos. However, if you're a mobile or creative professional, you'll need more space. Many smartphones have expanded storage options up to 512GB or even 1TB, and you can always sync your phone to your preferred cloud storage service to free up local storage space.
