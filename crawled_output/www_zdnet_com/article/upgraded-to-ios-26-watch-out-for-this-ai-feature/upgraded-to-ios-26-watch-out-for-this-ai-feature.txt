Upgraded to iOS 26? Watch out for this AI feature
AI news summaries could do more harm than good. Here's how to use them safely (or just turn them off).

Kerry Wan/ZDNETFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.ZDNET's key takeaways AI news and entertainment summaries return to iOS 26. The feature has a tendency to inaccurately summarize information. Apple offers a disclaimer before enabling the feature. AI can handle a lot well, including computational tasks, schedule coordination, and answering simple questions, but one area it tends to struggle with is message summarization.If you've tested out AI summaries in your Messages app, you've probably seen the AI attempt to summarize the text you just got, only to fall short in quickly, correctly, and concisely paraphrasing. I've seen this feature regularly miss the mark when a friend sends me several messages in a row that aren't all related. Also: Downloading iOS 26? Do these 6 things on your iPhone first (and thank me later)So when Apple brought AI notification summaries back to its news and entertainment apps with iOS 26, the feature came with a disclaimer. Now, when choosing which apps Apple's AI will summarize, iPhone users see disclaimers next to the choice for news and entertainment apps. "This beta feature will occasionally make mistakes that could misrepresent the meaning of the original notification," it reads. "Summarization may change the meaning of the original headlines. Verify information." Apple disabled AI notification summaries for news and entertainment apps in January, following the BBC's critiques that Apple's AI incorrectly paraphrased one of its articles, leading to inaccurate information dissemination. The summary incorrectly stated that Luigi Mangione had shot himself after his alleged killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. Also: Chatbots are distorting news - even for paid users"Trust in news is low enough already without giant American corporations coming in and using it as a kind of test product," former Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger told the BBC. Journalist unions called on Apple to disable the feature earlier this year. It's essential for news organizations to send accurate information to their readers and to know that info will arrive on their devices intact. Apple's feature is only the latest example of this ongoing problem; AI models, which still hallucinate, can mix up facts or get details wrong in an effort to deliver quick and digestible notifications at the expense of the information itself. How to opt outIf you want to opt out of AI news summaries, go to Settings, then select Notifications, select Summarize Notifications, and disable the feature. Artificial Intelligence
