Follow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.The search for the best Android phone is not easy. Android offers a variety of form factors and price points, from very affordable to ultra-premium phones that cost thousands (yes, plural) of dollars. You can choose from the standard candybar form factor, like the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, or foldable phones like the Motorola Razr Ultra, and pick from budget options like the Google Pixel 9a, all the way up to the most expensive Android phone you can buy, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7.We put every device through rigorous testing, using it for weeks to evaluate every little detail. Android phones are especially exciting for us -- not just because of the diverse hardware, but because each brand brings its own unique spin on the operating system. Unboxing a new Android phone always feels like an adventure. To help you find the right one, here are our top picks for the best Android phones in every category.Of all the top handsets we've tried and tested at ZDNET, the best Android phones offer a robust hardware-software package with just enough innovation to keep the user excited.What is the best Android phone right now?I thoroughly test every Android phone that makes its way onto my desk, spending at least two weeks -- up to months -- with each device before deciding whether it fits within ZDNET's buying guide. My pick for the best Android phone overall is the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra for $1,300, which features the company's flagship features and capabilities, including an S Pen stylus for precision inputs, AI features for productivity and creativity, a 200MP camera system, and the most durable display on any Galaxy phone yet.The Nothing Phone 3a Pro is another frontrunner for its sheer value. It sells for $459 yet offers premium features like a 120Hz OLED display, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 chip, and capable cameras backed by a new telephoto lens.

View now at AmazonView now at Samsung Why we like it: The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is the best handset of all the Android phones we've tested. The new Galaxy AI embedded in the device brings a slew of generative AI capabilities, including real-time phone call translations, multi-app AI voice prompts, enhanced photo editing, and a new AI Select tool that offers contextual shortcuts based on what you hover over. Notably, I've found that most of these features outperform AI tools offered by competing Android phones regarding speed, reliability, and practicality.Like its predecessor, the S24 Ultra, the S25 Ultra is built with a large 6.9-inch AMOLED and a reliable 5,000mAh battery. It helps that the S25 Ultra is made of a lightweight yet durable titanium frame and features Corning's Gorilla Armor 2, which is ideal for users who worry about damaging or scuffing up their devices.Under the hood, the S25 Ultra includes an upgraded Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset for improved graphics and AI features, and 12GB of RAM. From our testing, the Qualcomm processor not only yields greater day-to-day performance but also improves power efficiency for longer endurance. This is roughly nine hours of typical use per charge.Lastly, the big upgrade for the new camera system is a 50MP ultrawide lens that produces greater detail and vividness when capturing landscape and macro shots.Review: Samsung Galaxy S25 UltraWho it's for: Although the price of the S25 Ultra is still fairly inaccessible at $1,300, the phone's upgrades may entice users holding onto older devices and looking for something more capable. The S25 Ultra retains last year's anti-reflection screen which, when paired with the larger cooling chamber, makes it a fantastic multimedia device and easy to use when outdoors. If money is no object, or you score a competitive offer from your local carrier or retailer, then the S25 Ultra is the best phone you can buy today.Who should look elsewhere: With the S25 Ultra, you'll have to live with the fact that the S Pen no longer supports Bluetooth gestures, which previously allowed users to snap with a click of the stylus key. And if you're tight on budget or not a fan of the Ultra model's boxier footprint, I'd recommend a lower-tier S25 model or check out the Google Pixel 10 Pro series. Both options offer similar features but for less money.Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra specs: Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy | Display size: 6.9 inches | Storage options: Up to 1TB | Rear cameras: 200MP main, 50MP ultrawide, 50MP telephoto with 5x zoom, 10MP telephoto with 3x zoom | Front camera: 12MP | Battery: 5,000mAh | Price: Starting at $1,300

View now at AmazonView now at SamsungView now at Best Buy Why we like it: The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 is the best foldable phone going into the rest of 2025, thanks to its ultra-thin form factor and market-leading camera system, which captures more lifelike images than competing models from OnePlus and Google, based on our tests. Samsung took the traditional smartphone route when refining the outer display of the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7, opting for a wider, more regular aspect ratio panel than last year's narrower Galaxy Z Fold 6. That makes a notable difference in hand-feel and ergonomics, even though the two phones are only $100 apart. Compared to the standard slab-style phone, you're simply getting more screen with the Z Fold 7, with a larger 8-inch display when unfolded. For reference, most modern-day phones range from 6 to 6.8 inches.Naturally, all the content I've been consuming on the phone, like video streaming, social media feeds, and Google Maps, is portrayed in a highly consumable manner; nothing feels disorienting or cropped out. While the foldable doesn't match its Ultra sibling spec-for-spec, the Z Fold 7 truly shines and more than makes up for the "inferior" 200MP camera system in long exposure shots and selfies, thanks to its self-standing nature. Review: Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7Who it's for: I often recommend the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold over other foldables because of Samsung's feature-rich approach to software. Running on the OneUI launcher (over Android 16) means you can expect a simple yet customizable user interface, with support for up to seven years of operating system and security updates. I can't say the same for the OnePlus Open or Motorola Razr.This ultra-slim form factor is also ideal for multitaskers and other users who want to see as much information at once as possible without reaching for a tablet or laptop. You simply won't find a foldable with better ergonomics right now than this.Who should look elsewhere: With a $2,000 starting price tag, you're mostly paying for the innovation factor with this phone. So, if you're more interested in a safe and reliable handset that's arguably much easier to repair, then I'd recommend a traditional slab phone like the Samsung Galaxy S25 series instead.Users shopping for a foldable phone should also consider waiting for the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold if they prefer a handset with less bloatware and a stubbier design, or last year's Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 if they want S Pen stylus support, which the Z Fold 7 omits.Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 tech specs: Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite | Display sizes: 6.5-inch exterior and 8-inch interior | Storage options: 256GB, 512GB, or 1TB | Rear cameras: 200MP wide, 12MP ultrawide, 10MP telephoto | Front cameras: 10MP front | Battery: 4,400mAh | Price: Starting at $2,000

View now at Best BuyView now at GoogleView now at Amazon Why we like it: AI is part of the mainstream now, but before you'd ever heard of ChatGPT, Google was using AI to up its photography game in big ways. First, it used AI to help clean up photos and make subjects clearer, then it allowed you to remove objects from photos, and now it allows you to seamlessly merge photos together into that perfect moment. All that is to say, if you value photography, the Pixel 10 Pro XL and its suite of creative AI features is what should be in your pocket.The Pixel 10 Pro series is also the first to support Qi2 25W wireless charging with Pixelsnap magnets. This means it'll be compatible with the existing suite of MagSafe camera accessories like tripods, mounts, and docks, and can top up at a quicker rate than competing Android phones.Review: Google Pixel 10 Pro XLWho it's for: The Pixel Pro 10 XL is for photographers who want to be able to grab a quick point-and-shoot photo, and then explore ways that AI can enhance it. It democratizes a lot of what you see professional photographers do with apps like Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop, allowing you to move subjects around and fill in the gaps left behind, enhance lighting, and even put subjects into a new setting. This isn't really new to smartphone photography, but Google has been doing it for so long, it shows, both in the workflow and in the results.The Pixel Pro 10 XL has the largest non-folding screen that you can use as a viewfinder, which is important for finding the right composition. It also has the largest battery and the fastest charging of all the Pixels, so if those specs are important to you, then this phone is the winner.Who should look elsewhere: This is the largest and most expensive Pixel you can buy (that doesn't fold), so people who are on a budget may want to look at our midrange pick in this list -- the Pixel 9a. There's more on that phone below. The Pixel 10 Pro XL starts at $1,199, so it's definitely not for the faint of heart.This is also a large phone, so that might eliminate the skinny jean crowd. If you're a back-pocket phone carrier, you may want to look at this phone's smaller sibling, the Pixel 10 Pro, which has almost exactly the same specifications (and the same photography chops) in a smaller package.Google Pixel 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL tech specs: Processor: Google Tensor G5 | Display size: 6.3 and 6.8 inches | Storage options: 128GB/256GB/512GB/1TB | Rear cameras: 50MP main, 48MP ultrawide, and 48MP telephoto | Front camera: 42MP | Battery: 4,870mAh/5,200mAh | Price: Starting at $999 (Pro) and $1,199 (Pro XL)

View now at AmazonView now at Nothing Why we like it: There are three key reasons why you should buy the latest Nothing phone over any other mid-range phone. For $459, you get a decent-sized 6.77-inch AMOLED that ramps up to a 120Hz refresh rate, a reliable 50MP camera system, and a charming design -- both hardware and software -- that's rare in this price range.Compared to the latest Google Pixel 9a and Apple iPhone 16e, the Nothing Phone 3a Pro fields a transparent glass backing that's decorated with screws and data ribbons underneath. This is all accented with the brand's popular Glyph interface, an array of LEDs that shine and sparkle depending on incoming notifications, calls, timers, and more. It's a hardware package that makes other midrange phones look outdated and should appeal to fashion-forward users or folks who value innovation above all else. The Nothing Phone 3a Pro is rather competitive in specs, too, with a 6.77-inch 120Hz display that's larger and brighter -- up to 3,000 nits -- than its closest competitors. While it's only a Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 chipset powering the system -- meaning it won't breeze past Fortnite runs at max graphics -- I've found the processor good enough for daily browsing, social media consumption, and streaming movies.Review: Nothing Phone 3a ProWho it's for: If bang for your buck is what you're after, consider the Nothing Phone 3a Pro. It's a great-value handset that's designed to appeal to tech enthusiasts, trailblazers, and fashion-forward consumers. It also has a rather minimal software experience that will please users looking for a bloatware-free interface. Still, there's just enough easter eggs across widgets, settings, and customization options to prevent you from getting bored.Who should look elsewhere: Of course, some limitations are expected from a phone in this price range, such as a less-capable camera system that can be inconsistent in contrast levels and color. For example, this could mean making the sky appear muted or not having much depth between the subject and background. There's also no wireless charging support, a typical omission in this price range but still an annoyance for users who have adopted the technology. If that's a feature you require, I'd recommend the Google Pixel 9a instead.The last thing to note is that the Nothing Phone 3a Pro is only available through the company's Beta Program, at least here in the US. It's free to join but requires you to sign up on its website to buy the phone, meaning the Phone 3a Pro is unavailable at your local retailer or carrier store. That may be a dealbreaker for some.Nothing Phone 3a Pro tech specs: Processor:
Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 | Display size: 6.77 inches | Storage options: 256GB | Rear cameras: 50MP main, 50MP telephoto, 8MP ultrawide | Front camera: 50MP | Battery: 5,000mAh | Price: $459

Why we like it: There are three key reasons why you should buy the latest Nothing phone over any other mid-range phone. For $459, you get a decent-sized 6.77-inch AMOLED that ramps up to a 120Hz refresh rate, a reliable 50MP camera system, and a charming design -- both hardware and software -- that's rare in this price range.Compared to the latest Google Pixel 9a and Apple iPhone 16e, the Nothing Phone 3a Pro fields a transparent glass backing that's decorated with screws and data ribbons underneath. This is all accented with the brand's popular Glyph interface, an array of LEDs that shine and sparkle depending on incoming notifications, calls, timers, and more. It's a hardware package that makes other midrange phones look outdated and should appeal to fashion-forward users or folks who value innovation above all else. The Nothing Phone 3a Pro is rather competitive in specs, too, with a 6.77-inch 120Hz display that's larger and brighter -- up to 3,000 nits -- than its closest competitors. While it's only a Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 chipset powering the system -- meaning it won't breeze past Fortnite runs at max graphics -- I've found the processor good enough for daily browsing, social media consumption, and streaming movies.Review: Nothing Phone 3a ProWho it's for: If bang for your buck is what you're after, consider the Nothing Phone 3a Pro. It's a great-value handset that's designed to appeal to tech enthusiasts, trailblazers, and fashion-forward consumers. It also has a rather minimal software experience that will please users looking for a bloatware-free interface. Still, there's just enough easter eggs across widgets, settings, and customization options to prevent you from getting bored.Who should look elsewhere: Of course, some limitations are expected from a phone in this price range, such as a less-capable camera system that can be inconsistent in contrast levels and color. For example, this could mean making the sky appear muted or not having much depth between the subject and background. There's also no wireless charging support, a typical omission in this price range but still an annoyance for users who have adopted the technology. If that's a feature you require, I'd recommend the Google Pixel 9a instead.The last thing to note is that the Nothing Phone 3a Pro is only available through the company's Beta Program, at least here in the US. It's free to join but requires you to sign up on its website to buy the phone, meaning the Phone 3a Pro is unavailable at your local retailer or carrier store. That may be a dealbreaker for some.Nothing Phone 3a Pro tech specs: Processor:
Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 | Display size: 6.77 inches | Storage options: 256GB | Rear cameras: 50MP main, 50MP telephoto, 8MP ultrawide | Front camera: 50MP | Battery: 5,000mAh | Price: $459

View now at AmazonView now at OnePlus Why we like it: The OnePlus 13 delivers one of the more well-rounded flagship experiences we've tested, with a large 6.8-inch, 120Hz AMOLED, a 6,000mAh battery, a triple camera setup with a competent 50MP main lens at the helm, the latest Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, and more. For $899, it's very difficult to find a better flagship phone deal right now.Putting the value aspect aside, the OnePlus 13 shines with its charging speed; it's something I've learned to not take for granted, as competing Android flagships tend to require hours longer to top up. From my tests, the phone's 80W wired charging can power it from 0% to 50% within 10 minutes, with a full charge taking less than 30 minutes. That's compared to the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus, for example, which takes more than an hour to fully charge with its 45W standard. OnePlus also includes the 80W charger in the box, a free bonus that will benefit users who don't want to spend any more on accessories and are always on the go.Another vantage point is the OnePlus 13's IP69 rating, which laps its predecessor, the OnePlus 12, in water resistance. By IP69 standards, the phone can withstand high-pressure, high-temperature water jets and humidity changes. In other words, leaving the device in a washer and dryer, or even dropping it in a pot of boiling soup, won't damage it. Review: OnePlus 13Who it's for: The OnePlus 13 typically starts at $899, which is cheaper than its closest current competitors, the $999 Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus and Google Pixel 9 Pro. The price point alone makes it worthy of recommending to consumers looking for a flagship phone experience without needing to fork up $1,000 or more. For the money, you'll also get the fastest charging speeds on the US market, great for users who are always on the go or require as much power as possible in a given time.Who should look elsewhere: While the OnePlus 13 hits almost every mark from our testing, alternatives like the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL and Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus are more readily available at carrier stores and promise longer software support, both of which are ideal for users looking for a device they can hold onto for the next 5+ years.The OnePlus 13 also falls short when it comes to video-recording, with our tests exposing its inconsistent HDR capturing, color processing, and imperfect stabilization. Therefore, users who may lean heavier on video-recording should consider other flagship phones like the iPhone 16 Pro.OnePlus 13 tech specs: Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite | Display size: 6.8 inches | Storage options: 256GB/512GB | Rear cameras: 50MP main, 50MP ultrawide, and 50MP telephoto | Front camera: 32MP | Battery: 6,000mAh | Price: Starting at $899 (currently on sale for $750)

View now at Amazon Why we like it: The Pixel 9a is always a treat to review because, for the most part, you're getting everything you can get in the flagship version of the Pixel, but in a smaller, less expensive package. Truth be told, it's very hard to buy any phone today that doesn't get all the table stakes correct, but Pixels -- even midrange Pixels -- tend to rise to the top in terms of features. Google's software is awesome to use -- it's one of the best versions of Android you can find.The Pixel 9a in particular is quite good at photography. There are two camera sensors -- a wide and ultrawide, but it lacks a telephoto lens. That's fairly common for midrange phones, but what the Pixel 9a does, it does very well, and that includes all of Google's computational photography tricks, and Gemini tricks as well.Review: Google Pixel 9aWho it's for: The Pixel 9a is a budget phone starting at $499. It comes in a variety of fun colors, such as Iris, Peony, Porcelain, and Obsidian. Though it lacks a telephoto camera, the other two cameras are exquisite. I was particularly impressed with its ability to capture moving subjects without the typical blur you'll see at this price point. Low-light photography is also quite good.As for the rest of the phone, the software is the main other selling point. This is Google's phone running Google's operating system. If you are a tech nerd, that should appeal to you. Especially at the attractive price point. You can also easily buy the phone unlocked and take it to any carrier you want in the US, if you'd like. Who should look elsewhere: The biggest downside to the Pixel 9a is its design. In addition to the gigantic bezel that runs around the screen, the phone's back lacks the camera "visor" that's become iconic to the brand over the last few years. On the plus side, the camera bump is nearly flush with the back of the phone. On the downside, it's frankly a little boring, and the bezels around the front scream 2017-era smartphone. It's not a great look, so if you're someone who fancies a phone that stands out from the pack, this phone is not for you.If you're a spec nerd, you may also not like that this phone tops out at 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. The latter isn't terrible, but the former doesn't exactly scream future-proof. Add in the fact that Tensor processors are not known for their impressive power, gamers might want to find a different option as well.Google Pixel 9a tech specs: Processor: Google Tensor 4 | Display size: 6.3-inch | RAM/Storage: 8GB with 128GB or 256GB | Battery: 5,100mAh | Camera: 48MP wide, 13MP ultrawide, and 13MP front | Price: Starting at $499

View now at AmazonView now at Motorola Why we like it: Deciding on the best compact phone came down to the wire, with Motorola's Razr Ultra just scraping by Samsung's Galaxy Z Flip 7. I went hands-on with the new Razr Ultra model earlier this year, and was thoroughly impressed by the improved hinge system (read: the phone feels sturdier to flip open and close), as well as the performance, which is underpinned by an updated Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset and 12GB of RAM.Motorola's outer display still supports virtually any app you throw at it, meaning you can browse the web, play games, scroll TikTok, and do other mobile tasks without ever needing to flip open the device. Samsung's platform is more limited in this regard, which always felt like a missed opportunity when testing.It also helps that the Razr Ultra has a textured backing, including new Alcantara and Wood finishes, which I've found to be easier to hold and grip than competing flip phones. Considering how fragile these foldable devices can be -- anything with so many moving parts typically are -- the enhanced grip is easy to appreciate.Review: Motorola Razr Ultra (2025)Who it's for: Typically costing $1,500, the Razr Ultra is not a cheap flip phone by any means. That's why it's more affordable siblings, the Razr and Razr Plus, exist. But if you want the most complete, durable, and visually stimulating flip phone on the market right now, you'll have to pay to play with the Razr Ultra.I applauded Motorola for exploring new color and material finishes with this year's Razr, and that's something fashion-forward users will likely favor too. The battery on this year's model -- 4,700mAh, up from 4,000mAh -- is also much larger, which you can never really complain about.Who should look elsewhere: When buying the Razr Ultra, you should also consider aspects like Motorola's relatively short software update cadence, which ranges from 2 to 3 years, versus Google and Samsung's 7 years. If you're looking for a phone that's even more forgiving when dropped, I'd invest in a traditional slab handset instead, like the Samsung Galaxy S25 series or iPhone 16 Pro series.Motorola Razr Ultra (2025) tech specs: Processor:  Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite | Display sizes: 4-inch exterior and 7-inch interior | Storage options: 512GB, 1TB | Rear cameras: 50MP wide, 50MP ultrawide | Front camera: 32MP wide

It's a mouthful, I know.The latest model features various AI tools, like a wallpaper generator, to suit your theming preferences.

With all the focus on rendering graphics and processing power, the 50MP camera on the ROG Phone can produce washed-out and over-sharpened photos, and therefore, I don't recommend it for users shopping for a reliable camera phone.For those reasons, I'd suggest either the OnePlus 13 or Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra to anyone who wants a handset that's less polarizing.

Which is the right Android phone for you?
All of these phones run the same base operating system, but the user interfaces range from stock Android to more elaborate options. First, you need to figure out which best fits your needs.Camera performance across the board is solid for just about every phone on the list, but some are better than others. If you plan to capture photos as your primary function, you should look to Google, Samsung, or even OnePlus.If you plan to spend $1,000 or more, you may also want your phone to last at least a couple of years. You should consider companies with a good track record of regular updates, notably Google and Samsung, which currently promise seven years of software support.Choose this Android phone…If you want…Samsung Galaxy S25 UltraThe overall best with nearly no compromises. Buy this phone if you want a device that delivers on display and camera quality, AI features, and battery life.

How we test Android phones
ZDNET's review team spends upwards of a year testing the ins and outs of every major Android release, evaluating the day-to-day performance, camera quality, battery life and endurance, and more. Here's a breakdown of every factor we consider before we make recommendations:Design and ergonomics: How good a phone looks and feels plays a big role in many users' buying journeys, so we consider these aspects
heavily when testing.Performance: Several factors affect a phone's performance, including LTE/5G signal, battery life, and background tasks. Therefore, we typically begin our evaluations with a fully charged handset, with all background tasks closed, and with as stable of a mobile connection as possible.Camera quality: ZDNET tests phone cameras by capturing hundreds of photos and videos of various subjects and in various lighting conditions. We also compare the output to that of older models.Battery life and charging: It's also important for us to evaluate how long phones last under light, moderate, and heavy usage, how long they take to recharge, and how they do it (wired, wireless, or both).Special features: These features distinguish tested devices from a bustling smartphone market and hopefully bring added value to users, not the opposite.Pricing and availability: Beyond budget considerations, we also note if a phone is available in the US or only internationally.For a more extensive breakdown, check out our comprehensive phone testing methodology page.

Latest news on Android phonesGoogle just wrapped up its August hardware launch event, where the company unveiled new Google Pixel 10 series phones, Pixel Watch 4, and Pixel Buds 2a. Notably, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold was announced, but won't ship to consumers until early October.Following that is Samsung's September Unpacked event, which we expect to see updates to the Korean giant's tablet lineup, as well as a potential successor to its Galaxy S24 FE model.What is better, an iPhone or an Android?
Customizability remains one of the biggest vantage points of Android, even though Apple has done a commendable job over the past two to three iOS versions to give its users more autonomy. You can also expect Android phones to support the most innovative features in the mobile industry, like foldable displays and faster USB-C charging. The caveat of being more experimental is that Android phones are generally not as consistent and reliable as iPhones.On the flip side, iPhones are notorious for their stability and ease of use. If you're not one to tinker with your gadgets, then you'll fit right into the iOS ecosystem. Features like iMessage and FaceTime are also key differentiators when comparing iPhones to Android. Those two features alone can dictate your decision.

Here are my three biggest pointers on taking care of your smartphone in 2025:Speeding up your smartphoneSomething I always do when setting up a new Android phone is dialing up animation and transition speeds. You can do this by turning on Developer Options, a backend catalog of system settings meant for developers to access (but rules were meant to be broken, right?).Also: Best phones for battery life: Great battery, even better performanceTo turn on Developer Options, go into your About Phone page in the settings and look for the Build Number. Tap on that seven times, and you should see a pop-up indicating that Developer Options has been turned on. Now, the activated tab will appear in the main settings list. From there, scroll down until you find Windows, Transition, and Animator duration scale. Tap into each and switch from 1x (default) to 0.5x to double the speed of your phone's animations.Optimizing your battery healthTo preserve your phone's battery life, it's best to charge it between 20% and 80% and never let it drop to 0% or charge fully to 100%. This is because the heat generated from overcharging the phone can burn (or degrade) the battery, reducing its number of charge cycles. This phenomenon is the reason why you shouldn't charge your phone overnight or leave it plugged in for an extended period of time.When in doubt, after a year or two of usage, consider getting your phone's battery swapped to refresh its charge cycles. You'll be amazed at how well it functions again.How to keep your phone cleanUnless you're invested in a repairs and warranty plan like Samsung Care, consider suiting your phone with a protective case and/or tempered glass screen protector. Beyond drop protection, the two accessories will prevent the phone from getting scratches, scuffs, and other blemishes, and can greatly reduce the chance of water damage. For what it's worth if a manufacturer claims its phone is rated IP68, that means the device can withstand dust ingress and be submerged in water for up to 30 minutes at 1 meter deep.FAQ on smartphones

What is the best brand for Android phones?
The beauty of Android is that you have a lot of options. So the answer to "Which brand is best?" depends on your feature, user interface, and design preferences. If you prefer a more minimalistic approach to hardware and software, Google's Pixel line will serve you best. If you want everything but the kitchen sink in a smartphone, go with Samsung. For more unique value propositions like ultra-fast charging and a smooth interface, give OnePlus phones a try.Budget is also worth considering, but today, every major manufacturer, including Google and Samsung, offers Android phones in every price category (budget, mid-range, and premium) so it won't be your biggest decider.

What is the most reliable smartphone brand?
In the grand scheme, Apple is the most reliable smartphone brand, with the longest, most consistent support of all manufacturers. If we're looking at Android makers only, then Samsung would take the crown, with a promise of up to seven years of software updates for its latest phones, expansive carrier support across the US (and overseas), and one of the most reliable repair and insurance infrastructures.

How long does an Android phone last?
Most Android phones today should last at least seven years. For example, the latest handsets from Google and Samsung come with up to seven years of software support, meaning they'll receive updates and security patches for the long term. Of course, this applies more to flagship and some mid-range phones, whereas budget devices that sell for $300 and less tend to receive shorter commitments.Also: How to find out what apps are draining your Android phone's batteryHow you handle and use your phone will also determine its lifespan. It's highly advised not to keep your phone charged overnight as that can trigger faster battery degradation. It also helps to put on a case and/or screen protector to keep the device's hardware functioning properly. If it ever feels like your phone isn't lasting as long as it once did, consider swapping out its battery before replacing it with a new device altogether.

Which phone OS is most secure?
To generalize, most consumers will be choosing between iOS and Android, and between the two, iOS is the more secure operating system.The main reason is that the abundance of Android phones and app makers means there are more opportunities for hackers and data thieves to access your personal information and/or install malware. How these attacks are prevented and managed varies across manufacturers, with some OEMs like Google doing a better job than others like Xiaomi.While iOS on iPhones may feel more restrained and limited in customizations, that results in a more protected and secure software experience, from app availability on the store to how you download files online.

View now at Amazon The OnePlus 13R is my sleeper pick for best value smartphone of the year, with a starting price of $599. It's not too bulky, has a reliable display that's plenty bright, and boosts the same 80W charging speed as the OnePlus 13.While the handset launched in January, it remains a formidable option for budget and midrange shoppers today. From our tests, we found the Qualcomm Snapdragon processor, while older, reliably handles daily workflows and some gaming. The length of time since the OnePlus 13R debuted also makes it more susceptible to big discounts and sales going into the final months of the year.
