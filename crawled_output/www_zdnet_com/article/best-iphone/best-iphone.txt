Notably, the latest software version will likely not be compatible with some older iPhones including the iPhone XR and XS.

The best iPhones of 2025

View now at AppleView now at VerizonView now at Best Buy The iPhone 17 Pro Max is the best iPhone overall due to its highly capable specifications and supersized attributes. It's the iPhone model that sets a new standard for Apple every year and continues to be a worthy competitor to Samsung's S Ultra series and Google's Pixel Pro XL. Why we like it: Besides being the largest iPhone Apple currently offers, with a 6.9-inch AMOLED display, the iPhone 17 Pro Max also has the best-rated battery life with 39 hours of video playback. From our tests, we found the phone lasted much longer than the standard 17 Pro and last year's 16 Pro Max. The iPhone 17 Pro Max looks and feels fairly similar to its predecessor, but it's now made with aluminum instead of titanium. This material choice keeps the phone cooler and more durable. It also allows Apple to introduce a more exciting lineup of colors including the polarizing Cosmic Orange.The most notable hardware change with the latest iPhone is the vapor cooling chamber. This works in tandem with the updated A19 Pro chip to optimize and maintain performance loads. We found the feature ideal for photographers and videographers who often experience recording issues due to the iPhone overheating.Review: iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max Who it's for: The iPhone 17 Pro Max is a flagship phone that commands a flagship price. It's ideal for users who are willing to pay for the best iPhone available, whether that's directly through retailers or through carrier deals. You should buy the Pro Max version if you want the larger screen, enduring battery life, and triple-camera setup. Who should look elsewhere: If you're shopping on a budget and don't mind a smaller screen, consider the $1,099 iPhone 17 Pro. It's $100 cheaper and with a 6.3-inch display. If you can live without the dedicated telephoto lens, you can even go with the $799 iPhone 17. It features a ProMotion display and the same 40W wired charging rate.iPhone 17 Pro Max specs: Processor: Apple A19 Pro Bionic | Display size: 6.9 inches with 120 Hz refresh rate | Storage options: 256 GB, 512 GB, 1 TB, 2 TB | Rear cameras: 48 MP wide, 48 MP ultra-wide, and 48 MP 4× telephoto | Front camera: 18 MP | Colors: Cosmic Orange, Deep Blue, Silver | Weight: 233 g | Starting price: $1,199
Pros
Improved battery life with faster 40W wired charging
New 48MP telephoto supports 8x optical-quality zoom
A19 Pro processor and vapor chamber cooling greatly improves performance
Cons
Pricer than most flagship smartphones
May feel unwieldy for some users
Aluminum layering is easily scratched off

View now at AppleView now at Best BuyView now at Verizon The iPhone 17 looks, feels, and performs like a premium phone should. It also starts at $300 less than the iPhone 17 Pro series, putting it in closer reach for most consumersWhy we like it: The iPhone 17 brings several premium features from the Pro models including the 120Hz Pro Motion display, 40W wired charging, and support for Apple Intelligence, making it feel closer to a Pro than ever before. From our hands-on testing with the model, its slimmer, lighter design with curved edges offers a noticeably more comfortable grip than older iPhones, without sacrificing durability or style. Add in solid battery life, the reliable A19 chip, and a fun color lineup, and you've got a well-rounded device that delivers excellent value.The iPhone 17 has a new 18MP Center Stage front camera that can adaptively expand its framing to fit more people into shots. Having a square sensor also allows users to capture landscape selfies without needing to rotate the phone.Review: iPhone 17Who it's for: The iPhone 17 is a great choice for anyone who wants a modern iPhone with high-end features but doesn't need the full Pro experience, or price tag. If you care about one-handed usability, reliable performance, and more base storage like 256GB instead of 128GB, the iPhone 17 hits the sweet spot.Who should look elsewhere: If you're a power user who needs features like a telephoto lens, a vapor chamber cooling system, or more advanced camera tools, you should spring for the iPhone 17 Pro series. There isn't a Plus version this time around, so you'll have to settle for the iPhone 17's 6.3-inch form factor.Budget-conscious shoppers might also prefer to stick with the iPhone 16e or previous-gen models that still offer strong performance at a lower price.iPhone 17 specs: Processor: Apple A19 | Display size: 6.3 inches with 120Hz refresh rate | Storage options: 256GB, 512GB | Rear cameras: 48MP wide, 12MP ultra-wide | Front camera: 18MP | Colors: Lavender, Sage, Mist Blue, White, Black | Weight: 177g | Starting price: $799
Pros
Faster 40W wired charging
Same ProMotion display, 18MP selfie camera, and Apple Intelligence features as Pro models
Bright and colorful finishes
256GB of base storage is a win for everyone
Cons
No dedicated telephoto lens
No vapor chamber cooling like the Pro models

View now at AppleView now at T-Mobile Going off of retail price alone, the latest iPhone 16e is the cheapest iPhone on the market right now. The $599 starting price comes with its caveats, of course, but there are still several iPhone benefits that may interest budget shoppers.Why we like it: From our tests, the iPhone 16e excels in ways that are essential to most users, from the 6.1-inch OLED display that's both comfortable to hold and easy to view content, to the exceptional battery life thanks to the efficiency of the A18 processor, to the single 48MP Fusion camera that's capable of capturing vivid and detailed imagery.Sure, you'll have to settle with some trade-offs, such as the notched display and lack of MagSafe connectors. Still, the overall experience of the iPhone 16e, which runs on iOS 26 with most Apple Intelligence features, makes it a reliable handset for hundreds less than the flagship iPhones.Review: Apple iPhone 16eWho it's for: The iPhone 16e is ideal for shoppers who want the quintessential iPhone experience -- FaceTiming in decent camera quality, iMessage texting with the latest chat features, firing up multiple apps in sequence, etc. -- but don't want to spend a grand on a phone. As ZDNET's Sabrina Ortiz said after switching over from an iPhone 16 Pro, "I am equally impressed as I am surprised."Who should look elsewhere: The absence of MagSafe was one of our main critiques when testing the iPhone 16e, so if you're already accustomed to the popular accessory mechanic, you'll want to consider alternatives that support the feature, like the iPhone 16 and iPhone 15. The premium iPhone models also offer more flexible camera capabilities, including dedicated telephoto and/or ultrawide lenses.iPhone SE specs: CPU: Apple A18 | Display: 6.1 inches with 60Hz refresh rate |  Internal storage: 128GB, 256GB, 512GB | Rear cameras: 48MP wide | Front camera: 12MP | Colors: Black, White | Weight: 167g | Starting price: $599
Pros
The most affordable new iPhone in 2025
Solid battery life for the size
Excellent software support, with Apple Intelligence features
A capable 48MP camera with optical zoom
Cons
Outdated notch design
The 60Hz refresh rate display is inferior to competitors with 120Hz panels
Lack of telephoto and ultrawide lenses limits shooting capabiltiies

View now at AppleView now at VerizonView now at Best Buy The iPhone Air is arguably Apple's most innovative phone in years, and it's hopefully the beginning of a new era of ultra-thin handsets.Why we like it: The iPhone Air is remarkably thin and light, with a thickness of just 5.6mm and a weight of only 165 grams. For reference, the iPhone 17 Pro weighs 206 grams. Such dimensions make the iPhone Air a burdenless and comfortable phone to manage.The device's ultra portability will impress anyone who picks one up, but for me, seeing the fluid Liquid Glass animations flow across the 6.5-inch OLED screen was when reality really set in. This is what iOS 26 was meant for.While the iPhone Air lacks the vapor chamber cooling system of the Pro models, it does have the same A19 Pro chipset for enhanced performance and efficiency. I have tested the handset for more than a week now, and it has proven reliable at loading long pages of text and videos, as well as with editing content.Review: Apple iPhone AirWho it's for: I've been asking store associates and colleagues this exact question. The consensus is that the iPhone Air is for users who want a refreshing iPhone design that doesn't promote wrist strain with prolonged usage. The iPhone Air doesn't necessarily replace the iPhone Mini of previous years, but it opens up the possibility of more big-screen iPhones that don't feel like bricks.Who should look elsewhere: The iPhone Air's biggest drawbacks are its battery life and lack of supplementary camera sensors. If you want a device that will last all day and help you capture a wide variety of shots, I'd recommend the Pro or even base-model iPhones this year. Thin phone enthusiasts can also consider the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge, which lasts longer in our testing and has a similarly lightweight design.iPhone Air specs: Processor: Apple A19 Pro | Display size: 6.5 inches with 120Hz refresh rate | Storage options: 256GB, 512GB, 1TB | Rear cameras: 48MP wide | Front camera: 18MP | Colors: Light Gold, Space Black, Sky Blue, Cloud White | Weight: 165g | Starting Price: $999
Pros
Ultra-thin and light form factor makes this very comfortable to hold
Has the same A19 Pro chip as the iPhone 17 Pro Max
6.5-inch display is just the right size for content consumption
Cons
Subpar battery life
Lack of dedicated telephoto and ultrawide lenses makes the camera limited
Fairly expensive for what you get

View now at AppleView now at VerizonView now at AT&T While Apple continues to segment its iPhone line with "Pro" and now Air models, the regular offering, such as the now two-year-old iPhone 16, continues to be a viable option for consumers.Why we like it: The iPhone 16 hits a sweet spot in Apple's lineup, offering many of the features previously reserved for Pro models -- like the Dynamic Island, Camera Control, and a sleek, contoured design -- at a more accessible price. It's powered by the A18 chip, making it fast and capable for everyday use, from gaming to multitasking. Both the standard and Plus models are also receptive to Apple's iOS 26 update, so you gain access to the Liquid Glass redesign, enhanced CarPlay experience, and more. Combine that with one of the brighter Super Retina XDR displays we've measured and an improved 48MP main camera, and you get a phone that feels like a serious upgrade without the Pro price tag.Review: Apple iPhone 16Who it's for: This is the iPhone for people who want modern features, strong performance, and great cameras without splurging on a Pro model. It's ideal for everyday users who care about photography, video, and overall speed but don't necessarily need a ProMotion display or a telephoto lens. Starting at $699 or less if you shop around, it's a smart buy for most people who want a current-generation iPhone that's built to last.Who should look elsewhere: Power users who want the absolute best camera setup, a 120Hz display, or advanced editing tools may still prefer the iPhone 16 Pro or iPhone 17 Pro. If budget is your biggest concern, the iPhone 15 or 16e might be a better fit,especially if you don't mind sacrificing some modern design touches.iPhone 16 specs: Processor: Apple A18 | Display size: 6.1 inches with 60Hz refresh rate | Storage options: 128GB, 256GB, 512GB | Rear cameras: 48MP wide and 12MP ultrawide | Front camera: 12MP | Colors: Ultramarine, Teal, Pink, White, Black | Weight: 170g | Starting price: $699
Pros
Goldilocks size for iPhones
Pro-level camera system
Improved repairability
Identical software support as the more-expensive Pro models
Cons
Still 60Hz display
Doesn't have a telephoto lens
US customers are locked to eSIM

It's ideal for everyday users who care about photography, video, and overall speed but don't necessarily need a ProMotion display or a telephoto lens. Starting at $699 or less if you shop around, it's a smart buy for most people who want a current-generation iPhone that's built to last.Who should look elsewhere: Power users who want the absolute best camera setup, a 120Hz display, or advanced editing tools may still prefer the iPhone 16 Pro or iPhone 17 Pro. If budget is your biggest concern, the iPhone 15 or 16e might be a better fit,especially if you don't mind sacrificing some modern design touches.iPhone 16 specs: Processor: Apple A18 | Display size: 6.1 inches with 60Hz refresh rate | Storage options: 128GB, 256GB, 512GB | Rear cameras: 48MP wide and 12MP ultrawide | Front camera: 12MP | Colors: Ultramarine, Teal, Pink, White, Black | Weight: 170g | Starting price: $699

After weighing out the specs and reviewer-tested experiences, the best iPhone is currently the iPhone 17 Pro Max. It's got a beautiful AMOLED display and a powerful and future-proofed chipset, as well as a reliable camera system that covers all the bases and angles. Naturally, the 17 Pro Max is also Apple's most expensive model, so if pricing is a concern, consider cheaper options like the iPhone 16e and older models. iPhone models comparedBase PriceBase StorageDisplayProcessorCameras (rear)iPhone 17 Pro Max$1,199256GB6.9 inchesA19 ProThreeiPhone 17$799256GB6.3 inchesA19TwoiPhone 16$699128GB6.1 inchesA18TwoiPhone Air$999256GB6.5 inchesA19 ProOneiPhone 16e$599128GB6.1 inchesA18One

Are iPhones the best smartphone?
The answer depends on your needs and preferences. For example, while the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is ZDNET's current pick for best phone of 2025, it may not be the best option for you if you often rely on services like iMessage and FaceTime, which are exclusive to Apple's operating systems.Previously, the gap between iPhones and Android phones was much larger due to Apple opting for a Lightning port instead of USB-C, but with the iPhone 15 models switching to the more universal port for charging and data transfer, it's become less intimidating to switch from Android to iPhone, and vice versa.

Which iPhone model is right for you?
It used to be fairly easy to choose an iPhone model as you typically opted for either the "big" iPhone or the "small" one. With four models available in the iPhone 16 series alone, you now have to dig a bit deeper to choose which is best for you. This is especially true of the iPhone 16 and 16 Pro, which feature nearly the same hardware, so check out our question above for more on this decision.
Size is generally the first factor to consider, followed by price. Price limits will also drive the amount of internal storage you select for your iPhone.
One fantastic aspect of the iPhone is that all models receive software support for years and years, so it's perfectly viable to buy an older model and trust that it will work well for you for quite some time.Choose this iPhone...If you want...Apple iPhone 17 Pro MaxThe top-of-the-line iPhone experience. Buy the Pro Max if you want the largest iPhone available without any of the compromises found on other models. This variant, along with the Pro, also features a new vapor chamber cooling system.Apple iPhone 17A reliable iPhone that now includes several Pro features. For most users, the standard iPhone 17 should be more than enough.Apple iPhone 16eThe iPhone 16e is the cheapest model that Apple officially sells. You'll have to settle with a smaller, MagSafe-less design, but the performance makes up for it.Apple iPhone AirAn ultraportable iPhone that doesn't compromise on display size and quality. You'll just have to settle with a smaller battery and fewer cameras.Apple iPhone 16An older iPhone that can handle modern-day tasks. The iPhone 16 is still a solid smartphone if you want the Apple experience for less, and it supports USB-C.

Factors to consider when choosing an iPhone
We chose these smartphones by testing them for weeks and months, evaluating them based on real-world applications like phone calls, messaging, web browsing, and taking way too many pictures and videos. ZDNET's mobile experts also liaise with industry colleagues and analysts who have hands-on experience with the handsets, sifting through the iPhone pile for the best of the best. Here's the breakdown of what factors we look for.Display: Possibly the most overlooked feature on a smartphone, the display is what you stare at, scroll at, and interact with day in and day out. Therefore, when picking the best iPhones -- no matter the budget -- ZDNET puts an emphasis on devices with above-average panels. Ideally, a good display covers a wide color gamut, is durable, and has a high refresh rate for the smoothest visuals.Performance: One of iPhones' biggest strengths is their in-house silicon, namely the A-series of Apple chipsets. Thanks to this mingling of proprietary hardware and software, we've found the latest iPhones very capable of running the daily and weekly onslaught of apps and services. Camera quality: From group selfies to slow-motion videos, the best iPhones feature camera systems that are reliable and flexible to capture any shot you want. Naturally, an ample amount of storage size is also considered during the selection process.Battery life: For how reliant we've become on smartphones, the top picks on this list are not only able to last you from morning to night but also support fast charging when it's time to top up. Price: What you won't find on this list is a device that's not worth the money or is overcharging you for the hardware-software package you're getting.

How we test iPhones
ZDNET's review team spends upwards of a year testing the ins and outs of every major iPhone release, evaluating the day-to-day performance, camera quality, battery life and endurance, and more. Here's a breakdown of every factor we consider before we make recommendations:Design and ergonomics: How good a phone looks and feels plays a big role in many users' buying journeys, so we consider these aspects heavily when testing.Performance: Several factors affect a phone's performance, including LTE/5G signal, battery life, and background tasks. Therefore, we typically begin our evaluations with a fully charged handset, with all background tasks closed, and with as stable of a mobile connection as possible.Camera quality: ZDNET tests phone cameras by capturing hundreds of photos and videos of various subjects and in various lighting conditions. We also compare the output to that of older models.Battery life and charging: It's also important for us to evaluate how long phones last under light, moderate, and heavy usage, how long they take to recharge, and how they do it (wired, wireless, or both). Special features: These features distinguish tested devices from a bustling smartphone market and hopefully bring added value to users, not the opposite.Pricing and availability: Beyond budget considerations, we also note if a phone is available in the US or only internationally.For a more extensive breakdown, check out our comprehensive phone testing methodology page.

Latest news on iPhone  Apple just released the iOS 26 to the public, meaning general consumers can now download the latest software version on their iPhones and other Apple devices. The new iOS introduces key changes to how apps and interfaces are visualized, due to the new Liquid Glass design language, as well as usability enhancements across popular services like Messages, Phone, CarPlay, and Photos. Of course, you'll need to use a compatible iPhone model to update to the latest software; anything from the iPhone 11 and onward should qualify.Also: Apple iPhone 17 event recap: iPhone Air preorders, Apple Watch 11, AirPods Pro 3, moreThe iPhone 17 series launched on September 9 in four different models: iPhone 17, iPhone Air, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max. The biggest new features include a redesigned camera module on the Pro models, a 120Hz ProMotion display on the regular iPhone 17 model, and an ultra-thin design in the iPhone Air.Apple also announced new Apple Watches and AirPods alongside the iPhones.How do I take care of my new iPhone?
There are several ways you can keep your iPhone clean and pristine. One way is by equipping a protective case and/or screen protector. The best iPhone cases offer reliable drop and scratch protection, won't bulk up the phone, and may feature some extra utility like a kickstand or MagSafe ring. As for screen protectors, tempered glass options are your best bet to keep the display underneath free of scratches and cracks. They're relatively affordable, too, often coming in multipacks for less than $10.Battery management is another key aspect of iPhone maintenance. To keep your device running for as long as possible, consider charging it between 20% to 80% battery. Overcharging the device would otherwise wear down the battery and reduce the health value (found in Settings). When your iPhone battery health is low (anything less than 75% typically is), it would be helpful to get it replaced at an Apple store or by an Apple-authorized technician.As stressful as it may be to clear up space to download that software update, you absolutely should. Besides fixing any bugs on your iPhone, software updates also bring with them security patches to reduce the chances of your phone getting hacked.

iPhone FAQsWill my iPhone support iOS 26?
The latest version of iPhone software is iOS 26, and it will be supported by the most recent models, including the iPhone 17 series, iPhone 16 series, iPhone 15 series, and iPhone 14 series. Apple has confirmed that the now seven-year-old iPhone XS and XR models will not be eligible for the update, as the company typically cuts off support after that time span.

What is the new iPhone?
The newest iPhone is the iPhone 17 series, which includes the base model, Pro, and Pro Max. There's also an iPhone Air model that was released in tandem with the 17 series, featuring a thin and lightweight design and a single camera.

Lightning port vs. USB-C
One of the biggest upgrades when Apple launched the iPhone 15 series was the USB-C port, a faster, more powerful, and more universal charging standard than the Lightning port on previous models. There's really no argument for the Lightning port unless you still own legacy Apple accessories, like the AirPods, and would much rather stick with the one charging standard. Also: Best USB-C chargers and accessories: Expert testedOtherwise, even if you own an iPad or MacBook, or almost any other non-Apple gadget, USB-C is more widely used and truly the one-size-fits-all option for charging and transferring data.

Which iPhone models support Apple's new AI features?
Apple's existing and upcoming AI features, branded as "Apple Intelligence," are available on iPhones with at least an A17 Pro processor. That means the iPhone 17, 16, and 15 Pro series will support the AI tools.

What storage size should I buy for my iPhone?
It wasn't until 2021 that Apple began selling both its non-Pro and Pro iPhones with a base storage of 128GB. The only exception here is the iPhone SE model. While not as flashy of an upgrade as larger camera sensors and 120Hz displays, this double-up of storage meant that consumers had more space than ever to store apps, photos, videos, and more.Maurice Klaehne, senior market research analyst at Counterpoint Research, suggests that higher storage options are generally better as they will help with the longevity of the device, and his firm has generally seen an uptick in postpaid customers opting for higher storage sizes when they can afford them. "Currently, the 256GB option is sufficient for most people," Klaehne adds.

Should I trade in my old iPhone?
Trading in an old iPhone is one of the easiest and safest ways to replace an otherwise unwanted device with a new, more capable one. Most retailers, including Apple, accept trade-ins of older iPhone models, with store credit ranging from as low as $50 to $800. It all depends on which generation your iPhone is, the condition, and whether it's operable.
Show more
Do I really need an iPhone case?
While an iPhone case is not a necessity, but having one on greatly reduces the chances of wear and tear. For example, the best cases are military-grade certified, meaning they'll keep your iPhone protected from waist-high drops. Not only do cases reduce the chances of your phone getting cracked or scratched, but the plastic/rubberized material often provides more grip than if you hold your iPhone naked.

Which iPhone should I buy for a parent?
At the time of writing, the iPhone 17 is the best phone for a parent. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles of its Pro siblings, but the iPhone 17 model will have all the essential features in 2025, from eSIM support to a reliable battery and charging experience to a display large enough for any form of content consumption.From our testing, the cameras on the iPhone 17 are reliable enough for clear video calls, the occasional outdoor photo, and capturing images of children and pets.

What is eSIM?
Embedded Subscriber Identity Module, or eSIM in short, is the electronic version of the classic SIM card. That means your eSIM carries your phone number, mobile data plan, and telephone carrier info, just like a regular SIM card. The major difference between eSIM and SIM is that the former does not need to be physically installed onto your phone. This is why the iPhone 14, 15, 16, and 17 lines no longer have a dedicated slot for it. Instead, you'll have to transfer the information wirelessly via Apple's file transfer service, or with the help of your local carrier representatives.Also: eSIM vs. SIM: What's the difference?There is one problem that ZDNET editor-in-chief Jason Hiner sees with Apple forcing eSIM adoption on U.S. consumers. "There are a variety of good reasons why some people will still need or prefer a phone with a physical SIM card. The top reason is privacy. This is especially true for some journalists and populations at risk of persecution around the world. Removing the physical SIM card option reduces privacy for millions of people, especially some of the most vulnerable," said Hiner. Note that if you buy an iPhone 14, 15, 16, or 17 anywhere outside of the U.S., the device will come with a regular SIM card slot.

Which iPhone models support 5G?
All models within the iPhone 17, 16, 15, 14, and 13 line, as well as select iPhone 12 models, support 5G wireless technology. Even the new iPhone 16e supports Sub-6, low-band 5G networks.The fifth-generation mobile network continues to roll out across the U.S., and while it is debatable if there are benefits to the speeds of the network, in my experience, the broad coverage of low-band 5G has solved my connectivity issues in spotty coverage areas with past iPhone models.Even more importantly, the 5G iPhone models have Qualcomm chipsets inside that are proving to provide better RF reception than we saw in past iPhones that had Intel chipsets.
Show more
Which iPhone models support wireless charging or MagSafe?
All of the iPhone models in this list support Qi wireless charging technology, which is becoming an expected feature for modern smartphones from all manufacturers.Meanwhile, Apple's proprietary MagSafe technology is only supported by the iPhone 17, iPhone 16, iPhone 15, iPhone 14, iPhone 13, and iPhone 12 models. Notably, the latest iPhone 16e does not support MagSafe.Also: Best MagSafe accessories for your iPhoneMagSafe provides a secure magnetic connection system so that you can connect to wireless chargers with perfect positioning and alignment. MagSafe can also be used with other accessories, such as wallets and kickstands. While the extra security when your iPhone is docked to a wireless charger can be a nice bonus, it's not vital and probably shouldn't be a major determiner in your choice. Apple's first-party wallets and battery packs that use MagSafe have also received somewhat mixed reviews, making them a hard sell for all except the most die-hard Apple enthusiasts.

How many years do iPhones typically last?
While this number varies greatly depending on how you handle a smartphone -- perhaps you're a construction worker whose phone will be put through the harshest climates or you have kids who may drop the phone ever so often -- the iPhone will typically run efficiently for three to four years. Then, you'll likely experience more frequent app crashes, lag, storage problems, and more. Those are common issues that any piece of technology will inhibit, not just the iPhone, after years of constant usage. If you'd like to prolong that time, I'd recommend visiting your local Apple store to have the phone's battery replaced every three to four years and also consider backing up files to an external hard drive for safekeeping. As a last resort, a factory reset, followed by data restoration, should give your phone a brand-new feel.

For example, the device has a similar-sized OLED display that gets plenty bright when outdoors. There's also a triple camera system that, from our long-term testing, competes well with the 17 Pro Max. Perhaps most importantly, the iPhone 16 Pro series, whether you opt for the Max variant or not, supports the latest iOS 26 update and Apple Intelligence features.
