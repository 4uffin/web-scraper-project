Cloud-based Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP)
phone systems offer far more than traditional, analog business telephony services. In the business world, VoIP is now an expected standard solution for managing a business's communication needs. It's convenient, often affordable, scalable, and can be bolstered by smart features such as smart routing. Whether you're looking for VoIP, text messaging, video conferencing, collaborative tools, or an entry-level solution suitable for a growing business, there is a massive range of providers to choose from. These are the best providers on the market that combine business calling with advanced features, scalability, and value for money.What is the best business VoIP provider right now?ZDNET's top recommendation for a business VoIP provider is RingCentral. Available from $20 per user per month, RingCentral provides a high-quality VoIP service that businesses of almost any size will appreciate. It also offers valuable optional extras like AI transcription. If you're a smaller business looking for a VoIP service that provides the essentials, you could opt for DialPad's service instead. This is a more affordable option at $15 per seat per month, and it still excels at the basics. Also: The best password managers for businesses: Expert testedWhen I compiled my top choices, I sought out the experiences of ZDNET authors and users themselves. I also considered the reputation and history of each VoIP provider on our list ensuring that I only selected vendors who provide the services and features businesses need today.

View now at 8x8 If call quality is your top priority, consider 8x8's VoIP services. It's gathered solid customer reviews related to call quality, soft phone usage, and interoperability.Why we like it: 8x8's website and sales approach could do with an overhaul, especially when you consider that many competitors are transparent about pricing. Given its high levels of positive reviews for call quality, 8x8 is still a top contender in the VoIP space. 8x8 focuses on unified communications, offering customers the chance to go beyond VoIP. These expansion opportunities include adopting multi-channel and global support, call center and agent functionality, appointment scheduling, collaborative tools, AI, and centralized management via an admin console. You can also set up a Private Branch Exchange (PBX), which allows you to create an internal switchboard as well as accept calls from outside the network.Who's it for: A number of small to medium-sized businesses will find this solution meets their needs, but it should be noted that a vast number of complaints relate to 8x8 support. Still, if call quality is king, 8x8 might be your best bet.Who should look elsewhere: Anyone who is new to VoIP services might find that the support does not adequately meet their requirements, and so you might be better off with a different solution. Furthermore, a definitive price requires you to contact sales, although reports suggest pricing begins at roughly $24 per user per month, depending on customer needs. This lack of transparency may deter some users. 8x8 features: Custom plans | Enterprise-grade features | Robust APIs | Business app integration | Multi-channel | Mobile compatibility

Show Expert Take Show less What is a VoIP phone system?
Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) allows you to make a phone call through the internet rather than traditional phone lines, also known as analog lines.If you've already used WhatsApp calling or Zoom, you have used a VoIP system. Your voice is translated into data and then converted back into sound, a regular phone signal, before it reaches an end device. Typically, you will need an internet connection, a router, and a device capable of handling VoIP communications such as a dedicated VoIP handset, a smartphone, or a PC.VoIP is gradually replacing analog Private Branch Exchange (PBX) systems, used by companies to operate phone switchboards and extension numbers. VoIP services can reduce the cost associated with physical lines. They also utilize the cloud to scale up capacity as well as handle internal, domestic, and international calls. VoIP is also very useful for hybrid and remote working setups, as VoIP-ready phones or apps can replace traditional office phone lines.

How did I choose these business VoIP providers?
While compiling the list of the best VoIP providers in 2025, I considered the following factors:Scalability: VoIP services suitable for business users must be scalable. There's no point in starting small to cap costs and then being unable to expand as your business grows. Cost: Ongoing costs are a factor when a business makes any form of investment. The VoIP providers I have chosen must meet different budgetary needs.Features: I want to see VoIP providers offer more than barebones service. I have included solutions that provide features like transcription, video conferencing, chat, and analytics. Mobile: Mobile connectivity is a staple for communication today, and it is important that VoIP providers offer customers some form of mobile support.AI: In general, we like to see VoIP providers leverage new and emerging technologies in interesting ways. Regarding VoIP, features like AI-assisted transcription can be a real benefit for customers. Support: With any business-based service, you expect some form of customer support, whether by chat, email, telephone, or live help. The best options will provide a variety of channels for customer troubleshooting.Customer feedback: I have examined and researched each VoIP provider to learn how existing customers feel about the services provided.

What are the most important VoIP features for your business?
If you're considering replacing a traditional analog setup or starting off with VoIP, consider these VoIP features and what the most important aspects are for your business.Call management: You might want an automatic or smart system that handles call routing and processing for you. This could include virtual waiting rooms, voicemail and transcription services, grouping, and messaging. Capacity: Consider whether you need high-volume capacities for your VoIP system. A benefit of VoIP is that it is generally scalable based on the number of seats you require and how many calls you expect to handle. Reach: Some VoIP services are limited to domestic calling such as within the U.S. and Canada only, and others may charge for international calling. Many businesses now also prefer softphone capacity, which allows customers to reach out through mobile and PC apps and software.Call quality: Call quality should feature as a prominent aspect of any VoIP service you select. If your VoIP setup will be constantly used, you should opt for a solution with robust audio, low downtime, and low drop rates.

How is AI developing into a vital feature for VoIP services in 2025?
In the same manner as many industries, VoIP providers are adopting artificial intelligence features to stay competitive and to lure in users with the promise of streamlined operations, automatic content generation, and improved data analytics. You can find AI linked to automatic call transcription, for example, alongside implementations in customer assistance chatbots, environmental noise-cancelation -- to improve call quality -- and call routing. The latter may be able to help route customers to their desired location more efficiently. Sometimes it's less artificial intelligence and more simply "smart" features packaged up with a shiny phrase. So, it is worth taking new announcements with a pinch of salt. In recent news in the VoIP-AI space:The VoIP services market is predicted to expand by $21.59 billion between 2024 and 2028, driven by cost efficiency measures and AI.

Is my internet good enough for VoIP?
A benefit of VoIP is that it requires very little bandwidth. While the speed and reliability of your internet connection will determine the quality of a VoIP call, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) estimates that a typical VoIP call only requires 0.5Mbps. This is far less than your typical YouTube video or social media visit. If you have a basic internet package, VoIP calling is likely possible.

What are the disadvantages of VoIP?
While VoIP can work with a minimal internet connection, it still needs one to operate because there is no offline functionality, unlike traditional analog systems. Weak connections will result in laggy calls with poor latency.In addition, VoIP systems are likely usable during power outages and usually unsuitable for emergency situations. You should also consider the potential security ramifications of VoIP as they are more prone to cyberthreats than standard phone lines.

What's the difference between VoIP and Wi-Fi calling?
VoIP and Wi-Fi calling are similar in some respects but not the same. Wi-Fi calling is a smartphone feature that lets you make calls through your internet connection instead of using cellular services. In comparison, VoIP is a dedicated service that uses an available internet connection to make a call with a compatible device.

Is VoIP worth it for small businesses?
Yes, especially when you consider the cost savings element of these services. For example, it may be cheaper and quicker to set up VoIP than traditional phone lines in an office. This can provide more flexibility where employees work without relying on hardwired lines or hardware. VoIP services can also provide useful features such as video conferencing and collaborative tools.
