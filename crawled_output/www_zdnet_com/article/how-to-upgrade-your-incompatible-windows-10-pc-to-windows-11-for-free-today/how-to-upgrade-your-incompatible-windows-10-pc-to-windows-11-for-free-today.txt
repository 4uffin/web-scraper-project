How to upgrade your 'incompatible' Windows 10 PC to Windows 11 - for free today
Microsoft really doesn't want customers to upgrade older PCs, but there are workarounds for many models. Here's everything you need to know before support ends in less than three weeks.

BrasilNut1/iStock/Getty Images PlusFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.ZDNET's key takeawaysMost PCs from the last 15 years can run Windows 11, even if they fail compatability.PCs sold with Windows 10 can usually upgrade after a quick registry edit.On older or unusually configured PCs, a third-party utility gets the job done.On Oct. 14, 2025, Microsoft will stop delivering security updates to your Windows 10 PC unless you enroll that PC in the Extended Security Updates program.If you try to upgrade to Windows 11 on a PC that's more than five or six years old, you'll probably encounter an error message telling you -- in no uncertain terms -- that your old PC doesn't qualify because its CPU isn't on the official list of compatible processors. Microsoft has stated, forcefully, that it will not revise those requirements. You will also hit roadblocks if your PC doesn't have a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) version 2.0, or if the TPM is not enabled. Also: How to get free Windows 10 security updates through October 2026That might be the official policy, but -- as with everything Windows-related -- it pays to read the fine print.Those pesky restrictions prevent you from automatically upgrading to Windows 11 using Windows Update or the Windows 11 Installation Assistant. Yet, as hundreds of ZDNET readers have reported this year alone, there are documented workarounds for most PCs that were originally built for Windows 10. Also: Can't upgrade your Windows 10 PC? You have 5 options - and 3 weeks to actOver the past few years, Microsoft has played a cat-and-mouse game with enthusiasts, adding occasional speed bumps that make it more difficult to bypass these compatibility checks. There are workarounds for most modern PCs, but some older devices, especially those built using AMD processors, might be out of luck. The instructions below take all those developments into account. These instructions also assume that you have a PC with an x64 CPU (not ARM and not 32-bit), running a retail or OEM edition of Windows 10 (Home or Pro), and that you are signed in as an administrator on the PC you want to upgrade.  Which option should you choose? Please don't skip over this section.This article describes two upgrade options. To take advantage of the workaround described in option 1 below, your computer must meet all the other requirements for Windows 11.It must be configured to start up using UEFI, not a legacy BIOS configuration.Secure Boot must be supported, although it does not need to be enabled. (But seriously, folks, you should enable Secure Boot.)A TPM must be enabled; version 1.2 is OK, but a system without any TPM or with the TPM disabled will fail. Any PC that was originally designed for Windows 10 should include a TPM 2.0.To check these details on a PC you're considering upgrading, run the System Information utility, Msinfo32.exe, and look at the System Summary page. Pay special attention to the BIOS Mode value. If it says "Legacy," you'll need to reconfigure your system to UEFI mode (and convert your system disk from MBR to GPT partitioning) before you can install Windows 11 as a normal upgrade.To see whether your PC has a TPM enabled, run the Trusted Platform Module Management tool, Tpm.msc. If your computer includes a TPM and it's turned on, this app will display information about it. Under the TPM Manufacturer Information heading, check the specification version to confirm that it is 2.0. If there's no TPM, or if the TPM is disabled in firmware settings, you'll see a message that says "Compatible TPM cannot be found."If you're unable (or unwilling) to change from Legacy BIOS to UEFI, or if you have an older PC that doesn't have a TPM option at all, you'll need to use the second option, which takes advantage of an undocumented hack that allows you to bypass the compatibility checks and complete the upgrade. Skip to the Option 2 section of this post for details on how to use the free Rufus utility to perform this upgrade.Finally, note that Microsoft added a new set of restrictions as part of the Windows 11 version 24H2 update. These changes require a CPU that supports specific instructions -- SSE4.2 and PopCnt. Most PCs with Intel CPUs from 2009 or later will meet this standard. AMD CPUs from 2013 or later should also meet these requirements. But it is impossible to upgrade to Windows 11 version 24H2 on a PC that was built in 2008 or earlier. For details, see "Microsoft blocked your Windows 11 upgrade? This trusty tool can (probably) fix that."Also: Microsoft said these 400 readers couldn't upgrade to Windows 11. They did it anywayIf you plan to perform a clean installation of Windows 11, you can boot from installation media and run Windows Setup. That option skips the CPU compatibility check completely (but still requires a TPM and Secure Boot support). After the installation completes, you'll need to reinstall all your apps, restore your data files, and tweak settings to personalize your system preferences. Want to avoid all that hassle? Choose the option that's appropriate for your hardware. Option 1: Use this simple registry edit With this registry edit, you can bypass CPU checks and accept any TPM version. Please be aware that this option requires that you run the Setup program from within your current Windows installation. You can't boot from a USB flash drive and install Windows 11 this way. This process requires four steps.
1. Change one key in the Windows registry
You need to make one small change to the Windows registry. For more than three years, this change was documented at Microsoft's support website, but the company removed those instructions in December 2024. (Here's an archived version of that support article.) This change tells the Windows 11 Setup program to skip the check for compatible CPUs and to allow installation on a PC with an older TPM (version 1.2). The usual warnings apply when working with the registry; I recommend you make a complete backup before proceeding.Open Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) and navigate to the following key:HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\Setup\MoSetupIf the MoSetup key doesn't exist, you need to create it. Right-click the node for HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\Setup in the left-hand navigation pane, then choose New > Key. Name it MoSetup and press Enter.Also: Wiping your Windows laptop? Here's the simplest way to erase all personal dataSelect the MoSetup key and then right-click in any empty space in the pane on the right. Choose the option to create a new DWORD value. (Don't choose the QWORD option!)Replace the default name for that key by typing the text AllowUpgradesWithUnsupportedTPMOrCPU and then press Enter. Then double-click the new value and change the "Value data" box to 1. The result should look like this:

Use this registry tweak to override the Windows 11 CPU compatibility check. You must have a TPM (any version) and Secure Boot must be enabled. Screenshot by Ed Bott/ZDNETCheck for errors before proceeding -- Windows is frustratingly literal about the contents of the registry, and if you misspell the key or value name, or if you create the required value in the wrong location, your upgrade will fail. Click OK to save your change, and then restart your PC.
2. Download the Windows 11 ISO
On the PC you want to upgrade, go to the Windows 11 Download page (aka.ms/DownloadWindows11) and choose the option at the bottom of the page, "Download Windows 11 Disk Image (ISO) for x64 devices." Save the ISO file in your Downloads folder.Note that this is a big file. Depending on the speed of your internet connection, the download could take a while.Also: Your complete Windows 11 upgrade guide: Everything to know - before you ditch Windows 10For those running Windows with English (UK) as the selected language, you might run into problems during the installation process. The default download is English (United States) but you also have the option to choose
English (International)
when prompted for a product language. Several readers have reported that choosing the wrong language results in an upgrade that does not allow you to keep installed apps and data files. If that happens, back out of the upgrade, download the other language option, and try again.

3. Mount the ISO file in File Explorer
After the download completes, open File Explorer and double-click the ISO file you downloaded in the previous step. Doing so mounts the file as a virtual DVD drive in its own folder, with its own drive letter.

4. Run Windows Setup
In File Explorer, find the Setup.exe file in the virtual drive you opened in the previous step and double-click it to begin the upgrade. You'll see a stern warning about compatibility issues and the possibility that performing an upgrade will mean you are not entitled to future updates. You can safely click Accept to move past this message. (For details on what that warning message really means, see "Is Microsoft really going to cut off security updates for your 'unsupported' Windows 11 PC?" Spoiler: They are not going to cut off security updates.) After you click OK on that dialog box, your upgrade should proceed without any serious issues.Also: Why Windows 11 requires a TPM - and how to get around itIf you're upgrading from the same edition (Home or Pro), you'll have three options: You can keep your apps, settings, and files (Full Upgrade); keep your data files but start fresh with apps and settings (Keep Data Only); or start completely fresh (Clean Install).One last piece of advice: Watch carefully at the beginning of Setup for an option labeled "Change how setup downloads updates." To increase your chances of a successful upgrade, click that link and choose the "Not right now" option. That should allow Windows Setup to finish faster -- you'll have a chance to download those updates after the upgrade is complete.

If you encounter any difficulties or if the upgrade fails, check this article for detailed advice on what to do to find and fix the problem: Windows 11 upgrade failed? These are my 4 most powerful troubleshooting secrets Option 2: Use the free Rufus utility On older PCs without a TPM and on PCs that don't support Secure Boot and UEFI, you'll need to use an undocumented hack to bypass the compatibility checker. It is technically possible to do this manually by replacing the Appraiserres.dll file (in the Sources subfolder on the Windows 11 installer drive) with a zero-byte version and then making a series of registry edits. But it's simpler to use the free, open-source Rufus utility to create installation media (on a USB flash) drive that includes these tweaks automatically. To get started, download Rufus version 4.6 or later. Earlier versions won't work, thanks to changes Microsoft made in October 2024 to its compatibility checking tools. For details of how the newer versions work, see "Microsoft blocked your Windows 11 upgrade? This just-released tool can get the job done." In addition, be aware that using Rufus will not allow you to bypass the new restrictions on very old PCs that were introduced with Windows 11 version 24H2. If you have a PC with a CPU that lacks support for SSE4.2 and PopCnt instructions, not even Rufus can help. (Of course, any PC that fails that test is nearly 20 years old and probably deserves to be retired.) Also: You can still upgrade old PCs to Windows 11, even if Microsoft says no: Readers prove itTo get started, you'll need to download the Windows 11 ISO from aka.ms/DownloadWindows11. Choose the option at the bottom of the page, "Download Windows 11 Disk Image (ISO) for x64 devices." Save the ISO file in the Downloads folder of your Windows system drive so you can find it easily. You'll also need a USB flash drive of at least 16 GB in size. You will reformat this drive as part of the process, so back up any data on that drive first -- and do not store the Windows 11 ISO here!Download Rufus from the developer's site or from the Microsoft Store and run the app.In Rufus, choose the USB drive and then choose the "Disk or ISO image" option.Click the Select button, choose the Windows 11 ISO you downloaded earlier (hint: it's in your Downloads folder), and then click Start.In the Windows User Experience dialog, select the first checkbox to remove hardware requirements, as shown in the screenshot below. Adjust any other settings as you prefer.Click OK to accept those changes and then click Start to begin creating the bootable installation drive.
Be sure to choose the top checkbox here to bypass the compatibility check for the Windows 11 upgrade. Screenshot by Ed Bott/ZDNETAfter Rufus successfully creates your installer, open that USB drive in File Explorer, and double-click Setup. Do not try to upgrade by booting from that USB drive and performing a clean install; it won't work. Several readers have reported that Setup failed prematurely and displayed an error message ("An unsupported operation was attempted") when run from media created using Windows 11 version 24H2 and the latest version of Rufus. The fix? Watch carefully at the beginning of Setup for an option labeled "Change how setup downloads updates." Click that link and choose the "Not right now" option, as shown here. That should allow setup to continue without interruption.
If Setup quits unexpectedly with an error message, try again but choose this option insted.  Screenshot by Ed Bott/ZDNETAs is the case with the other option, you'll see a warning about compatibility issues. It's a scare tactic. (For details on what the language in that warning message actually means, see "Is Microsoft really going to cut off security updates for your 'unsupported' Windows 11 PC?") After you click Accept on that dialog box, your upgrade should proceed without any serious issues. Also: Consumer Reports slams Microsoft for Windows 10 mess, urges extension of free updatesMy ZDNET colleague Lance Whitney has more details on the other options available with Rufus in "How to install Windows 11 the way you want (and bypass Microsoft's restrictions)." Did your upgrade work? If you've tried this upgrade, I want to hear about your experience. If it worked, please share the details. If you run into snags, send me an email so we can figure out what's going wrong. Be sure to include details -- the make and model of your PC and screenshots of any error messages.  If you're able to create a report using the SetupDiag utility, please include that as well -- you'll find detailed instructions in my Windows 11 upgrade troubleshooting guide.
