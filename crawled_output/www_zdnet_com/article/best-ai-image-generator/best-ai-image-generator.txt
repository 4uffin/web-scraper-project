Text-to-image generators are a fun and useful application of generative AI that everyone can take advantage of. Just type a simple prompt and generate a visual representation of whatever you're imagining. The possibilities are endless. These AI generators can be used for personal projects such as creating greeting cards, event invites, and wallpapers, or for professional projects such as developing brand assets, social media content, or marketing campaigns. There are so many AI image generators on the market that excel at different tasks, and to help you decide which to use for your needs, we tested all of the models and compiled all the findings below. Testing MethodologySince image generators became popular at the end of 2022, many advancements have been made. As a result, they are much more capable and can tackle complex prompts such as human faces and text in a highly realistic manner. I've been testing AI image generators since 2022 and have had to update my methodology several times to keep up with the pace.  For my most recent round of testing, I gave each image generator tool the same prompt: "a person standing in front of the camera smiling with a green colorful pasture in the background with a sign that says 'green meadows'." I also included screenshots to help you decide which tool best matches your needs. Also: The best AI chatbots: ChatGPT, Copilot and worthy alternativesFrom ChatGPT's brand-new GPT-4o image-generating model to more established competitors, such as Midjourney, there were some overall really impressive results. Some things to look out for are how well it outputs text, human characteristics, and the background. Because the first two are extra challenging to do well, it is worth separating each element from the others as you analyze the image, especially because you likely will have a use case that needs to be good at all three simultaneously. Since the image quality is only one factor in choosing an image generator, I also included details on cost, speed, accessibility, and other standouts from my testing. You can also filter the data based on your needs to reflect what you need to see the most. What is the best AI image generator overall? In my most recent test, Google's Imagen 3 remains as the top free image generator, since it can produce realistic, detailed, results, including text. Its competitive advantage is that it is entirely free to access, and just as good as models that require hefty subscriptions, combining accuracy, speed, and cost-effectiveness and can generate images in seconds.Also: Is that image real or AI? Now Adobe's got an app for that - here's how to use itHowever, in this round, ChatGPT's newest model is what really surprised me. OpenAI's DALL-E 2 made a huge splash as the first mainstream AI image generator. Since then, DALL-E 2 was discontinued and its more advanced model, DALL-E 3, also paled in comparison to competitor's models. However, OpenAI recently released its GPT-4o image generation model which is tremendously better than its predecessing models. It can tackle a range of tasks really well including people, scenery, text, posters, room renderings, and more. In addition, with the subscription that gets you higher limits, you can also access the entire suite of ChatGPT premium features, which even includes its Sora video generator. For that reason, it is the best AI-paid image generator. For the full roundup of the best AI image generators, keep reading.

View now at Gemini Google was an underdog in the image generator space, releasing its Imagen models months after its competitors. The wait was worth it. Imagen 3, available in Google's Gemini chatbot and the ImageFX standalone experience, can produce high-quality, realistic outputs, even of objects that are difficult to render, such as hands.ImageFX is a standalone experience, and it's easy to use. All you have to do is sign in to your Google account, type in a prompt, and let it do the magic for you. You can also take advantage of cool features such as "expressive chips," which allow you to swap out elements of your prompts for more generations. Also: How to use ImageFX, Google's AI image generatorGoogle also updated its AI chatbot Gemini to let you generate photos using Imagen 3. Like when using ChatGPT and Copilot, you can access the text-to-image model while chatting with Gemini. It's useful to not have to context switch between platforms for your text and image generation needs.If you are a Google user, you will probably prefer Gemini's user interface because it has the same look and feel as Google Search. This isn't just surface-level. Gemini double-checks the validity of its responses against Google Search and offers links that take you to the search engine.Imagen 3 in ImageFX: Powered by: Imagen 3 | Access via: Website or app | Output: Depends on medium, one in Gemini, four in ImageFX | Price: free

View now at Chatgpt OpenAI, the AI company behind ChatGPT, launched DALL-E 2 in November 2022. The tool quickly became the most popular AI image generator on the market. After launching its most advanced image generator, DALL-E 3, OpenAI discontinued DALL-E 2. Then, in April 2024, the company launched the GPT-4o image model, which surpassed both preceding models.This image model delivers high-quality results on very difficult prompts, such as realistic images and, most impressively, accurate text, as seen in the image above. However, what earned it the title of best subscription AI image generator is how much it can do and how much the subscription gets you. Because it is integrated within the ChatGPT interface, you can conversationally ask it to do nearly anything you want, such as using a reference image to create a new one, generate images on transparent backgrounds, use specific colors from HEX codes, follow directives such as adding"humor", and handle 10-20 different objects, which means you can prompt it to generate a high volume of elements in one go. Also: Is ChatGPT Plus worth your $20? Here's how it compares to Free and Pro plansFree users can access the model with a limit. For individual users, the best option is ChatGPT Plus, which costs $20 per user per month and comes with many other perks, including OpenAI's Sora video generator, custom GPT creation, Advanced Voice Mode, and Deep Research. Students even get free access for a limited time.GPT-4o features: Powered by: GPT-4o by OpenAI | Access via: ChatGPT website and app, and Sora interface (for paid users) | Output: One image per prompt | Price: Limited access for free or a ChatGPT Plus for $20 per month

View now at Midjourney I often play around with AI image generators because they make it fun and easy to create digital artwork. Despite my experiences with different AI generators, nothing could have prepared me for Midjourney.The output of the images was so crystal clear that I had a hard time believing they weren't photos that someone had taken. The software has even produced award-winning art, and when you scroll through the gallery of user-generated images, it is not hard to see why.When it first launched, Midjourney's biggest flaw was that it wasn't very user-friendly. Since then, however, Midjourney has greatly simplified the process, launching a standalone webpage that makes it easy to get started. For step-by-step instructions, check out ZDNET's guide, How to use Midjourney to generate amazing images and art.The biggest problem with Midjourney is that you must subscribe for $10 per month. Although the rendition of above may not seem particularly noteworthy, Midjourney consistently produces high-quality images of everything from objects to people to scenery, which may make the cost worth it to daily users. Midjourney features: Powered by: Midjourney | Access via: Standalone site or Discord | Output: Four images per prompt | Price: Starts at $10/month

View now at Adobe Adobe has been a leader in developing tools for creative and working professionals for decades. As a result, it's not surprising that its Firefly image generator is impressive. Accessing the generator is easy: Visit the website and type a prompt for the image you'd like generated. The chatbot has some really help customization features such as Structure Reference and Style Reference. Structure Reference enables you to input an image you want the AI model to use as a template. The model then uses this structure to create a new image with the same layout and composition. Style Reference uses an image as a reference to generate a new image in the same style.The biggest perk is that Adobe Firefly was trained on Adobe Stock images, openly licensed content, and public domain content, making all the
generated images safe for commercial use. The artists whose work is being used to inspire your generation have also given consent and are being compensated, giving you the peace of mind that you aren't exploiting anyone's work. Additionally, Adobe's Content Credentials, which function as a "nutrition label" for digital content, showing the images' vital ingredients, including the creator's name and the tools used to create the content, are automatically added to images created on the platform, ensuring you don't spread misinformation. Adobe Firefly features: Powered by: Firefly Image 3 or

View now at Leonardo.Ai As seen in the different examples above, many AI image generators can produce incredibly realistic-looking images and, as a result, risk spreading misinformation. As a result, most mainstream image generators have implemented guardrails that prevent users from creating images that replicate public figures or trademarked characters. Leonardo.AI, however, is much more lenient.Also: The best AI search engines: Google, Perplexity, and moreLeonardo.AI's competitive edge is that you can generate images of characters. We don't recommend that you use an AI image generator to create harmful images of public figures, but there are some benign use cases. For example, if your friend or kid is a big Disney fan, you can ask the image generator to create a realistic image of Mickey Mouse in a specific environment. Even when generating non-copyrighted images, the model is still capable of producing really high-quality results, as seen in the example photo. It is also nice to be able to generate images without the safety guardrails that can sometimes be limiting for no reason. For example, if you ask other generators with strict guardrails to generate a person with descriptions similar to a celebrity's appearance, sometimes you won't get a result. Leonardo.AI features: Powered by: Leonardo's suite of fine-tuned AI models | Access via:  | Output: One to four images per prompt | Price: Free daily allocated tokens, but you must subscribe for more

View now at Recraft One of AI image generators' biggest challenges is generating text onto images. Often, the words are misspelled, scrambled, illegible, or not what the user intended. However, Recraft V3 can generate accurate long text strings quickly and for free. This is particularly useful because, many times, you are using an AI-generated image for a larger project, such as a greeting card or social media post, which could benefit from having text added to it. By being able to generate it when you ask for your initial prompt, you save yourself some time uploading
the image into another editor after adding the text you'd like. Also: I tested this viral AI image generator, and it does text well - finally! Try it for freeAnother plus is that when using the image generator, it can make the text appear native to the pic. For example, I generated an photo in which I asked it to generate an image of a computer screen that read ZDNET's brand's mission statement, "ZDNET, tomorrow belongs to those who embrace it today," in electric yellow. All you have to do is visit the website, click on "Generate AI image," and create a Recraft account or sign in with an existing Google, Discord, Apple, or single sign-on. You'll also notice it has a unique interface that marketers and designers could use to their advantage, being able to produce product mockups with a simple click.

View now at Getty Images One of the biggest issues with AI image generators is that they typically train their generators on content scraped from the internet, which means the generators use aspects of creators' art without compensation. This approach also puts businesses that use generators at risk of copyright infringement.Also: Need stock images? I tested Getty's 'safe' AI generator - and it's good (with caveats)Generative AI by Getty Images tackles that issue by generating images with content solely from Getty Images' vast creative library, with full indemnification for commercial use. The generated images have Getty Images' standard royalty-free license, assuring you that the content is fair to use without fearing legal repercussions.Another pro is that contributors whose content was used to train the models are supposed to be compensated for their inclusion in the training set. This is a great solution for businesses that want stock photos that match their creative vision but do not want to deal with copyright-related issues. Many options help users who may not even be familiar with AI-generated image generators do well, including prompt builders, and many customization options such as content type (photos or illustrations), aspect ratios, camera controls, including lens type (wide angle or telephoto), and depth of field (shallow or deep), and color and mood.   Generative AI by Getty Images features: Powered by: Nvidia Edify family | Access via:  | Output: Four images per prompt | Price: Paid (price undisclosed, have to contact the team)

Show Expert Take Show less What are AI image generators capable of?
An AI image generator is software that uses a generative AI model to create images from user text inputs, usually within seconds. The pictures vary in style depending on the software's capabilities, but they can typically be rendered in any style you want: 3D, 2D, cinematic, modern, Renaissance, and more.If you've ever searched Google for hours to find an image you needed, artificial intelligence (AI) may be able to help.With AI image generators, you can type in a prompt that is as detailed or vague as you'd like. These tools can help with branding, social media content creation, and making invitations, flyers, business cards, and more.Another major perk of these generators is that they take seconds to generate, with the longest generation taking about a minute. Even if you have no professional use for AI, don't worry -- the process is so fun that anyone can (and should) try it out.

Do you need to pay for AI image creators or are the free versions good enough?
Ultimately, whether you should pay for an image generator or not depends on your use cases. If you are a business and need a commercially safe generator or the highest quality renditions, then paying for services like Midjourney or Generative AI by Getty Images makes sense. If you are a consumer looking to generate images occasionally for fun and leisure, then there are plenty of highly competent free AI image creators, and I would advise you not to pay for a subscription.Lastly, if you are a power AI user, many subscriptions, such as ChatGPT Plus, also include advanced AI and chatbot features that may make it worth it.

How do you use AI image generators?
Like other generative AI models, AI image generators require a lot of data. Typically, these models are trained on billions of images, which are then used to in turn create impressive images. Follow these simple steps to get started using one yourself: 1) Visit the website of the generator you are interested in using.2) Sign in or create an account if the site requires you to have one to access the generator. 3) Type a detailed prompt about what you'd like the generator to output.For a more thorough breakdown on how to start using AI Image generators, check out our how-tos such as: How to use Microsoft Designer's Image Creator (formerly Bing Image Creator) or  How to use Midjourney's website to generate amazing images with AI or ChatGPT's stunning new image generator is now free for everyone

How did I compare these AI image generators?
To find the best AI image generators, I tested each generator listed and compared their performance across UI/UX, image results, cost, speed, and availability. Each AI image generator had different strengths and weaknesses.UI/UX: The interface design and overall user experience are a big factor. Even though using an image generator should be as simple as typing in a text prompt, some platforms overcomplicate things, making it hard to get started.Image quality: If you use an image generator, it is likely because you want to produce high-quality art, pictures, or other media. Therefore, one of the biggest factors is the ability to create realistic and detailed images with as few artifacts as possible.Price: There are so many great free AI image generators. We thus want to ensure that if you have to pay to use a model, it is worth every penny, since some free generators can produce incredible outputs.Speed: Many image generators can produce images in seconds, setting the expectation for image generators to be quick. Therefore, it is noticeable when a model takes longer. Slowness is a significant con.Safety: The guardrails that the image generator has in place prevent spreading misinformation, creating deepfakes, and stealing artists' work are also heavily evaluated.

What's the future for AI image generators?
Many AI image generators on the market shine in terms of speed, quality, and affordability. That said, there isn't much more I'd like to see from image generators that could significantly improve the offerings. Furthermore, the future of AI image generators isn't about updating current offerings, but rather moving from one-dimensional to three-dimensional renditions. Some companies, such as Stability AI, already have 3D object image generators, such as Stable Video 3D, which generates 3D objects from single images. Text-to-image video generation is also the next big thing, with many companies, including OpenAI, Google, and Stability AI, already working on their own generators.

Frequently Asked QuestionsWhat is the best free image generator?Google's Imagen 3 is the best free AI image generator because it produces the highest-quality, most realistic image for free. How do you fix a poorly generated image?You can fix a poorly generated image by readjusting your prompt to fix the element of the image you are having trouble with. For example, if you say, "Generate an image of the beach," and are disappointed at the way the ocean looks, you can input another prompt that says, "Generate an image of a beach with crystal blue, shallow water." The more specific you get, the better your result will be. Are there ethical implications with AI image generators?AI image generators are trained on billions of images from across the internet. These images are often artworks belonging to specific artists, which an AI tool repurposes to generate your image. Although the output is different, the new image has elements of the artist's original work that are not credited to them.Are AI-generated images copyrighted?Whether an AI-generated image is copyrighted depends on the terms of the generator you are using. The copyright policies also vary between subscription tiers. The best way to proceed is not to assume and to double-check before you use or publish a generated image.How do I properly disclose that my images were AI-generated?A good habit when using AI to generate images is to disclose that AI was involved in the process. Doing so helps build trust with your audience, as well as helps prevent misinformation from spreading. A disclosure can be as simple as something that reads, "Generated by [the name of the generator]." You will notice that at ZDNET, we always disclose when we use an AI image generator image in an article, using a disclosure such as, "Sabrina Ortiz/ZDNET via [Image generator name]."(Disclosure: Ziff Davis, ZDNET's parent company, filed an April 2025 lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.)
