Zuckerberg introduces Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses with a Neural Band
Kerry Wan/ZDNET
By Sabrina Ortiz, Senior Editor / Sept. 17 at 8:30 p.m. ETIn a live demo of the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, Zuckerberg went beyond messaging. He tried answering video calls using the Neural Band. However, there were technical difficulties that caused this demo to fail. That's show biz! A more successful attempt was raising the volume on Spotify by simply making the motion of turning up a volume nob. By Cesar Cadenas, Writer / Sept. 17 at 8:28 p.m. ETThe Meta Neural Band is, as the name suggests, a wristband that lets users control the digital display using simple hand gestures. In a live demo, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg used the Neural Band to write and send texts.

Meta Ray-Ban Display
Jason Hiner/ZDNET
Arguably, the most important announcement at Connect 2025 was the reveal of the Meta Ray Ban Display. These are a new version of the smart glasses that project a small readout screen over your right eye.Before the event, various rumors claimed the wearables would "feature a monocular HUD that projects navigation pathways [via a map app], translations, messages, and exchange with the Meta AI assistant." The model would have a significantly bulkier design, mainly around the corners, to account for all the extra tech needed to support said digital displays. It seems those claims were right on the money. However, there is still plenty about the Ray Ban Display that we don't know. Those same rumors also stated that text boxes, maps, and the like seemingly stay static. They won't latch onto objects in front of you like an AR (augmented reality) headset would.Much about the smart glasses remains in the dark, but I'm sure we'll find out sooner or later.

How expensive will the new Meta smart glasses be?
Meta
Initial reports and rumors claimed that Meta's future wearable would be expensive. The Ray Ban Display, in particular, was said to cost $1,400. While these are pricey devices, none of the models are anywhere near $1,400.The Meta Ray Ban Display will launch on September 30 and retail for $799. It'll be available in two colors: Black and Sand.

Meta Neural Band
Sabrina Ortiz/ZDNET
Initial reports mentioned that Meta would "begin offering a so-called neural wristband [codenamed Ceres] for the first time." It appears that this device was the Meta Neural Band shown off at Connect 2025. This is an accompanying accessory to the Meta Ray Band Display that converts electrical signals from wrist muscles into gesture controls. For example, rotating your hands will let you scroll through apps, and a finger pinch will allow users to select specific items.The presentation for the Neural Band was short. There's still much we don't know. Those early reports said the band would have a haptic engine delivering tactile feedback to the user. Meta's product page for the Ray Ban Display doesn't say much about the accessory, focusing primarily on the wearable.

A gaming VR headset made with Asus?
Kerry Wan/ZDNET
Once again, rumors claimed that Meta might have unveiled the Asus ROG Tarius, a VR headset that will be the first third-party device to run on Horizon OS, on Wednesday. Meta opened its operating system to third-party companies in April 2024. But the Tarius was a no-show. It didn't make a single appearance at Connect 2025, and it didn't even get a mention or hint. Perhaps the Tarius needs more time in the oven. Considering that it'll be under the Asus ROG umbrella, Tarius is likely to be a gaming-centric device. Much of the information that we currently have comes from a single leak that surfaced in January of this year. Also: I tried smart glasses with a built-in display, and they beat my Meta Ray-Bans in key waysIt claims Tarius will support both eye and face tracking. The screen inside the visor will either be micro-OLED or QD-LED with local dimming. Assuming this is all true, the QD-LED screens could be used to achieve high amounts of contrast.That's pretty much all we know. No word on what it'll look like or what kinds of games it'll support. We don't even know what chipset it'll run. Could it eschew more towards the Meta Quest 3 and deliver a top-notch performance, or will it be like the Quest 3S and be less powerful in favor of having a lower price tag? It's hard to say at the moment.
