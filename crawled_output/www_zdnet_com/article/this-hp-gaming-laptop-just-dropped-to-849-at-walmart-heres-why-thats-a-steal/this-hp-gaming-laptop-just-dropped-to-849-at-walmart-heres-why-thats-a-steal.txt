HP Omen 16 HP/ZDNETBuy the HP Omen 16 for $849 (save $550) Save $550
5/5 Editor's deal rating $849 at Walmart Several gaming laptops from major brands have seen big price drops at Walmart. After looking through what's available, one device in particular caught my eye: the HP Omen 16.Right now, you can buy HP's Omen 16 for $849, a $550 discount. Inside is an Intel Core Ultra 5-225H processor, Nvidia GeForce RTX 5050 graphics card, 16GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD. Not a bad configuration for gaming. Battery life is reportedly 10 hours and 15 minutes of video playback, which is better than many other gaming laptops. On certain premium models, you'll be lucky to crack eight hours.Also: Best Amazon Prime Day laptop deals live nowContrary to the bulky builds often seen with gaming laptops, the HP Omen 16 has a sleek, lightweight design. It measures 10.59 x 14.07 x 0.78 inches. Weight isn't stated in the Walmart listing; however, looking at the official listing on HP's website, you'll see that the laptop weighs 5.35 pounds.

Buy the HP Omen 16 for $849 (save $550)
$849 at Walmart User reviews on the Walmart page praise the HP Omen 16 for its lightweight design and its solid performance. Judging only by the specs, I would have to agree with them. This laptop is carrying some of the most recent hardware releases from Intel and Nvidia alongside a sharp 2K, 165Hz display to deliver an immersive experience for your favorite games. AAA titles will run very well... for the most part. The Intel processor and RTX 5050 GPU aren't the most powerful combo. The laptop will struggle to run games at maximum settings.How I rated this dealAs per ZDNET's rating system, I give this deal a perfect score of 5/5. $550 off is a roughly 40% discount. It's not quite that amount, but the value that the HP Omen 16 provides cannot be overlooked. $849 for a computer like this is great, and I would recommend it over many other low-cost desktops.
