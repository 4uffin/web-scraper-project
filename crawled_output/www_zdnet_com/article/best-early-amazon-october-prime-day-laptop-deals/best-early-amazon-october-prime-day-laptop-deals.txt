Dell 14 Plus for $849 (save $250)
Cesar Cadenas/ZDNET
Current price: $849Regular price: $1,099We went hands-on with Dell's new 14 Plus earlier this year, and praised it for its all-around reliability and performance relative to value. Armed with an Intel Core Ultra 7 and 16GB of RAM, you're getting a device with the latest hardware for a competitive price point.

Asus Vivobook S 15 for $1,048 (save $250)
Kyle Kucharski/ZDNET
Current price: $1,048Regular price: $1,299If you're looking for a 15-inch laptop with a gorgeous OLED screen, the Vivobook S 15 has a 3K 120Hz display paired with a 12-core Snapdragon X Elite processor for vibrant visuals and fantastic battery life (two things that historically didn't go together). Review: Asus Vivobook S 15We praised the Vivobook S 15 as one of the first Copilot+ PCs to be released last year with a lightweight 3.1-pound body and bright, 600 nit screen. In the office or at home, the 12-core, 3.4GHz chip with a 45 TOPS NPU is snappy and responsive, especially for the price.

Kerry Wan/ZDNET
Current price: $899Regular price: $1,049Acer's Swift 14 AI is a versatile laptop for work, school, or home use, covering the basics and a respectable hardware loadout for a midrange price point.

Microsoft Surface laptop for $1,129 (save $470)
Kyle Kucharski/ZDNET
Current price: $1,129Regular price: $1,599When we tested the Surface laptop last year, it was a surprisingly enjoyable experience backed up by some pretty fantastic battery life. The Snapdragon X Elite processor gave us over 15 hours of use, and the portable, durable body makes for a solid device for hybrid commuters who utilize Windows' suite of productivity software. Review: Microsoft Surface laptopThe Surface laptop comes in a handful of different configurations, but the 14-inch model with 16GB of memory, 1TB of local storage is on sale for almost $500 off, making now the time to spring if you've got your eye on one.

Kyle Kucharski/ZDNET
Current price: $998Regular price: $3,799Dell's 16-inch Inspiron from 2024 is heavily discounted right now as the manufacturer rolls out its latest lineup (see the Dell 14 Plus also mentioned on this list). The fact is that the Inspiron 14 is still a versatile, reliable laptop that's equally suited to most use cases. Review: Dell Inspiron 16With an Intel Core 7, 32GB of RAM, and a FHD+ touchscreen display, the Inspiron 16 is a big screen device with a full-sized keyboard and the power to back it up.

Best Prime Day MacBook deals
Apple MacBook Air M4 (15-inch) for $999 (save $200):
Kyle Kucharski/ZDNET
Current price: $999Regular price: $1,199When the M4 MacBook Air dropped earlier this year, we praised it as one of the best laptops of 2025 and a solid pick for most people. The 15-inch Air is the "goldilocks" of laptops: not too small, not too big, but as ultraportable as it is powerful. Review: MacBook Air M4 (15-inch)The ability to drive two external monitors with the lid open, more starting memory, and Apple's Liquid Retina technology provides a crisp display. The starting configuration with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of local storage is on sale for $999, a competitive price for the ultraportable that defined the category.

Current price: $1,499Regular price: $1,799Apple's latest and greatest MacBook Pro with the blazing-fast M4 chip is on sale for a competitive $1,499, a great deal for the configuration with 16GB of memory and 1TB of storage. The MacBook M4 has a stunning display, Apple's Liquid Retina XDR with up to 1600 nits peak brightness, and is three times faster than the M1 Pro. Review: MacBook Pro M4It also supports up to 24 hours of battery life and the improved Phone app on the MacBook, allowing you to use your phone on the laptop exactly as if it were in your hands.

MacBook Air M4 (13-inch) for $799 (save $200):
Kyle Kucharski/ZDNET
Current price: $799Regular price: $999The 13-inch MacBook Air M4 is Apple's latest ultraportable, weighing just 2.7 pounds and thin enough to slip into a bag unnoticed. It comes in multiple versions, but the configuration with 16GB of unified memory and a 256GB SSD starts at just $799. The lightweight form factor doesn't mean it's not powerful -- it features a 12MP Center Stage camera, fast and responsive performance, and sports 18 hours of battery life.

MacBook Air M2 (13-inch) for $699 (save $100):
Jason Hiner/ZDNET
Current price: $699Regular price: $799If you're looking to save a little cash on a new machine, the 13-inch MacBook Air from 2022 is still a competitive laptop with the M2 chip -- and significantly less expensive than the newest M4 lineup. Review: MacBook Air M3The 10-core CPU is fast and responsive, and supports the latest and greatest MacOS 26 Sequoia, with all the same features as the M4: the new liquid glass UI design, all the new Apple Intelligence features, and up to 18 hours of battery life to top it all off.

Apple Mac Mini (M4) for $499 (save $100):
Jason Hiner/ZDNET
Current price: $499Regular price: $599The Mac Mini M4 is a huge upgrade from the last Mini, bringing more ports, tons of configurable options all the way up to 64GB of RAM, and compatibility with a wide range of monitors, keyboards, and peripherals.Review: Mac Mini M4
The result is an accessible Mac that takes up very little desk space and one of the easiest ways to jump into the Mac ecosystem. With support for up to five external displays, it's a productivity powerhouse in a small package.
