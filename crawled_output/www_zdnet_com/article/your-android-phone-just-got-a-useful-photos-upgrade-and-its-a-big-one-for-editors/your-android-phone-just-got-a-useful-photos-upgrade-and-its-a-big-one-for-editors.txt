Also: Did Google just give us the ultimate AI photo-editing tool? I tested it on the Pixel, and hard agreeThe feature was exclusive to the Pixel 10 series at first, but that window is up, as Google has announced the feature is rolling out to all eligible Android users starting this week.
How to use Google Photos' conversational photo editor To get started, open the photo you want in Google Photos and tap the "Help me edit" button in the bottom corner. You'll see a couple of preselected prompts like "remove background clutter" or "focus more on the subject," but you'll also see a text field that lets you enter anything.
GoogleBy typing or speaking, you can tell Gemini what you want to do. Google says you can ask for a simple edit like "remove the glare" or "add clouds to the sky," make a general request like "make the photo better" if you don't know specifically what you want, or even get creative with wild edits like sending your subject to outer space or transporting your pet to the beach.
Also: 10 must-try Google Photos tips and tricks - including a new AI editorOnce you've entered your prompt, Gemini gets to work performing your edits. In a demo video shared by Google, the finished product arrives in just a few seconds.
Any photos you use this feature on will have a C2PA "Edited with AI tools" label. Also: 5 easy ways to transfer photos from your Android device to your Windows PCThis addition follows several other AI-powered additions to Google Photos recently, like the ability to turn photos into short video clips or remix them into different art styles like anime, 3D, or sketch (AI search, though, still leaves a lot to be desired). Conversational photo editing debuted alongside several other new features like Camera Coach, an improved Add Me, and an Auto Best Take option. Google hasn't confirmed whether any of the other features are heading to more phones anytime soon, but it seems likely they will. Featured
