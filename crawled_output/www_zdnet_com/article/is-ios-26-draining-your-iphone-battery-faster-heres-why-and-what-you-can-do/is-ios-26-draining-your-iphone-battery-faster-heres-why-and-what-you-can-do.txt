"Depending on individual usage, some users may notice a small impact on performance and/or battery life. Apple continually works to optimize these features in software updates to ensure great battery life and a smooth user experience."Redesigned Battery screen  Given enough time and future software updates, the battery drain should become less severe and less noticeable, or at least people will complain about it less.
