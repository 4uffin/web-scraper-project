Employees learn close to nothing from phishing training, and this is why
A new study reveals that in the best-case scenario, success is measured in the single digits. Here's what companies should do instead.

Simply put, it wasn't, and there was almost no difference in failure rates for those who completed the training versus those who did not. The groups were separated by a reduced likelihood of falling for a phishing email of only 2%. This is especially concerning, given that phishing was found to be the leading cause of ransomware this year, fueled by infostealers and the abuse of AI tools, according to Datamotion's new SpyCloud Identity threat report. Phishing was also the most reported attack vector by businesses participating in the research and was cited by 35% of affected organizations -- up from 25% in 2024.What is phishing? Phishing is a constant scourge and is a threat that impacts individuals, SMBs, and enterprises alike. Phishing campaigns often take the form of spray-and-pray fraudulent emails or targeted messages designed to elicit curiosity, panic, or fear in their recipients. By crafting messages that inspire fear or urgency, cybercriminals hope that their victims will not take a step back and think rationally, but will, rather, panic-click a button or hand over sensitive information that can be used in identity theft, to conduct fraudulent transactions, or for use in broader cybercrime. Also: Scammers are now faking the FBI's own website - here's how to stay safeWhen the threat is so serious, and a phishing-related breach can lead to severe consequences for an organization -- including data theft, destruction, financial consequences, ransomware deployment, and reputational harm -- companies, naturally, will look for solutions. Phishing training programs are a popular tactic aimed at reducing the risk of a successful phishing attack. They may be performed annually or over time, and typically, employees will be asked to watch and learn from instructional materials. They may also receive fake phishing emails sent by a training partner over time, and if they click on suspicious links within them, these failures to spot a phishing email are recorded. Why phishing training doesn't workUC San Diego Health and Censys researchers said subject matter was important to the success of a phishing email in their study. For example, barely anyone clicked a link to update their Outlook password, whereas over 30% of participants clicked on a link in an email pretending to be an employer update to vacation policies. Also: Best VPN services 2025: The fastest VPNs with the best networks, rankedThe longer a phishing scheme continued, the more likely an employee was to click a fraudulent link, rising from 10% of participants in month one to over 50% by the eighth month."Taken together, our results suggest that anti-phishing training programs, in their current and commonly deployed forms, are unlikely to offer significant practical value in reducing phishing risks," the researchers said.According to the researchers, a lack of engagement in modern cybersecurity training programs is to blame, with engagement rates often recorded as less than a minute or none at all. When there is no engagement with learning materials, it's unsurprising that there is no impact. Potential solutionsTo combat this problem, the team suggests that, for a better return on investment in phishing protection, a pivot to more technical help could work. For example, imposing two or multi-factor authentication (2FA/MFA) on endpoint devices, and enforcing credential sharing and use on only trusted domains. That's not to say that phishing programs don't have a place in the corporate world. We should also go back to the basics of engaging learners. As a former teacher, I would suggest that tabletop discussions, in-person seminars, and even gamification could provide the missing link between training and positive outcomes. Featured
