Elyse Betters Picaro / ZDNETFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.ZDNET's key takeawaysYou can now follow your favorite publishers in Google Discover.Discover shows not just articles but videos and social posts too.Follow ZDNET to get more of our latest news, reviews, and guides.Google Discover is getting a major upgrade that finally lets you take control of what shows up.You might not have heard about Discover, but you've definitely seen it. It's the personalized feed that appears when you swipe right from your Android phone's home screen, open the Google app, or start a new Chrome tab on your device. It constantly refreshes with a scrollable list of content -- articles (and now, videos and social posts) -- that Google thinks you'll like.
Also: You can run a Google search in Windows now - no browser neededFor publishers like ZDNET, it's a huge deal because it's one of the main ways readers find our articles -- including our news, reviews, and guides -- all without having to search for them. Discover has long been algorithm-based, which means you're completely at the mercy of what Google chooses to serve up, although it takes into consideration your search history.
But just like how Google Search recently added the option to prioritize sites in its Top Stories carousel, Discover now lets you directly follow your favorite publishers and creators. That means you can tell Google you want to see more ZDNET -- and it should listen.
How to follow sites in Google Discover
What you'll need: Right now, you can follow publishers and creators in the Google app on Android and iOS. You can still access Discover in other places, but the follow option only appears when you're scrolling through Discover in the Google app. Your follows are tied to your Google account, so your personalized feed should travel with you between devices and apps.
1. Open the Google app
First, you need to get to Discover. That means you need to open the Google app. On most Android phones, it's preinstalled, but you can download it from the Google Play Store or Apple App Store if you're on iOS.Open (or download) the Google app.Make sure you're signed into your Google account. (Tap your profile icon in the top right of the app.)The Discover feed usually appears right on the app's home screen, just below the Search bar.

2. Look for content you like and hit follow
As you scroll through Discover, you'll see a new Follow button on content from supported publishers and creators. Letting Google know you want to see more of their content is as simple as tapping the button.In your Discover feed, find a story, video, or post.Tap the new Follow button that appears next to the publisher or creator's name (for example, ZDNET).That's it. Discover should now prioritize content from sites, publishers, and creators you love.

3. Optional: Other ways to customize Discover
Discover has other features that allow you to better signal to Google what you want to see in your feed. You can, for instance, simply tap through and actually read or watch the content in Discover, to show Google what you like to see. Also: This free Chrome tool cleans up your Google searchesBut you can also "heart" or like content in the Google app, and you can click the three-dot more options button on content to tell Google you want to see less like that, are not interested, or you can even ask Google to not show any content at all from that specific publisher. If you want the best experience, I recommend taking all these steps.Tap on content: Open and read or watch content in your feed to show Google what interests you.Like content: Tap the heart icon on content to give positive feedback.Use the three-dot menu: On any content card, tap the three dots to see less content like this, mark a topic as "not interested," or block content from a specific publisher.

Elyse Betters Picaro / ZDNETFAQs
What is Google Discover?
Google Discover is a personalized content feed you can access by swiping right from your Android home screen, opening the Google app, or starting a new Chrome tab on your phone. It uses your interests, Google Search history, and now your follows to serve up articles, videos, and social posts from around the web that you might want to see. For many publishers, it's a major traffic source.
Also: How to get rid of AI Overviews in Google Search: 4 easy waysIn September, Google updated Discover with a Follow button and more types of content. Alongside articles, Discover now includes short-form videos and social posts from platforms like YouTube, Instagram, and X. These may appear grouped together under certain topics in a single card, which you can tap to open a dedicated space with related recent articles, videos, and posts.
Elyse Betters Picaro / ZDNETHow do I unfollow something in Discover?If you change your mind about a publisher or creator, it's easy to unfollow them.
Open the Google app.Tap your profile icon in the top right.Go to Search personalization.Tap Following.You'll see a list of everything you follow. Just tap Unfollow on the ones you don't want anymore.This "Following" setting also affects notifications and personalization across other Google products, so check it occasionally.
Elyse Betters Picaro / ZDNETHow do I see my favorite publishers in Google Search? Â Beyond Discover, Google Search recently added the option to choose preferred news sources in Google Search's Top Stories carousel. I also wrote a full guide that walks you through how to tell Google you want to see more of ZDNET when browsing news.
