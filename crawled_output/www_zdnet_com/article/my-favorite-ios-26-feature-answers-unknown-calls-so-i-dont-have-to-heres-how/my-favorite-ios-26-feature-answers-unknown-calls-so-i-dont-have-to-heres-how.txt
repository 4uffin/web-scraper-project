My favorite iOS 26 feature answers unknown calls so I don't have to - here's how
An automated voice can screen your calls by asking for the caller's name and reason, and it even shows you a transcript, so you can decide whether to pick up.

Elyse Betters Picaro / ZDNETFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.ZDNET's key takeawaysiOS 26 adds built-in call screening for unknown numbers.Let an automated voice ask for the caller's reason.Transcripts can help you decide whether to answer or ignore.I get a ton of unknown and spam calls, and after years of reading ZDNET articles about phone scams, I never answer these random numbers -- I just let them go to voicemail. But with iOS 26, Apple finally gave me a new way to handle these calls without putting my safety at risk. The update introduced a built-in call screening feature tucked inside the Phone app settings.Also: This iOS 26 trick made my old iPhone photos really pop - in 3DWith this feature, an automated voice answers unknown calls on my behalf, asks the caller to state their name and reason for calling, and then shows me a transcript so I can decide whether to pick up.Technically, the new call screening feature can do three things:Let the unknown call go through like normal.Silence the unknown call so it goes straight to voicemail.Or -- my favorite -- have an automated voice screen the unknown caller.After testing the last option this past week, I can honestly say it's one of my favorite iOS 26 features. It keeps spam away and gives me more control over unknown calls. Here's exactly how to set it up.How to screen unknown calls on your iPhone What you'll need: An iPhone running iOS 26. I used my iPhone 16 Pro to take screenshots for this article.
1. Open the Settings app and go to Phone
The first step is to open the Settings app and find the Phone menu under Apps. This is where Apple tucked away all its new call screening controls.Open the Settings app (gray icon with gears).In Settings, go to Apps > Phone (or search for "Phone" in Settings and select it).

2. Find 'Screen Unknown Callers' and choose an option
In iOS 26, Apple gives you a few different ways to manage calls from numbers you haven't saved. The default setting, Never, lets unknown calls ring through and appear in your Recents list. Silence goes the other way, sending all unknown calls straight to voicemail without bothering you. The middle option, Ask Reason for Calling, prompts the caller to say who they are and why they're calling, then delivers you a quick transcript so you can decide whether to pick up or ignore it.Also: Got iOS 26? Turn on this iPhone setting to make your screenshots instantly better - here's howIn the Phone menu, scroll until you see Screen Unknown Callers. There, you'll find the three options:Never: Calls from unsaved numbers ring through, and missed calls appear in your Recents list.Ask Reason for Calling: Unsaved numbers are asked for more information before your iPhone rings. Calling and data rates may apply.Silence: Unsaved numbers are silenced, sent to voicemail, and logged in Recents. Calling and data rates may apply.I really like using Ask Reason for Calling. I've found it successfully weeds out spam calls while still giving me the chance to answer legitimate ones I might not want to miss. If you're like me and get overwhelmed with robocalls during the week, this setting is worth a try. Or go with Silence for total peace of mind -- just know you might miss important calls, though the caller can always leave a voicemail.Either way, you can change your setting anytime, and it's fun to experiment.

3. Optional: Use call filtering to keep your Recents log tidy
iOS 26 can also separate unknown and spam calls from your Recents log in the Phone app, moving them into their own lists so they don't clutter up your main call history.Open Settings > Apps > Phone.Under Filter Calls, turn on:Unknown Callers: Unsaved numbers are moved from Recents into a separate Unknown list.Spam: Suspected spam is silenced, sent to voicemail, and added to a Spam list. (On my phone, calls are identified by Verizon, so this appears to be a carrier-supported feature.)Also: How to clear your iPhone cache (and why you should do it before updating to iOS 26)Later, you can go into the Unknown list and mark certain numbers as known if you want them moved back into Recents. In the Phone app, tap Filter > Unknown Callers > the number > Mark as Known. You can also delete entries from the list. In the Spam list, you can review flagged calls and delete them if you'd like.

Which iPhones support call screening?Any iPhone that can update to iOS 26 has this feature. It's not limited to the newest models and doesn't require Apple Intelligence.How does call screening work in practice?Before I let iOS 26's call screening feature handle all incoming calls I haven't saved in my contacts, I decided to test it. Also: Why I'm recommending this iPhone 17 model to most people (and it's not the Pro Max)I had my husband call me from an unknown number (he used his friend's phone, which I hadn't saved). He said an automated voice came on and told him, "Hi, if you record your name and reason for calling, I'll see if this person is available." My phone stayed silent as the call rang, and I watched it transcribe his response on my screen.Meanwhile, my husband said he waited less than 30 seconds for me to pick up.With call screening, do important calls get silenced by mistake?Possibly. For example, when I tried testing Silence, I had an unknown call from my health insurance company silenced and routed to voicemail. Not a big deal to me, but you should experiement with the feature for awhile to see if it's even something you find useful.Are there other call filtering features I can try?Yes. Your iPhone can also help verify incoming calls from businesses. It uses information from Apple Business Connect or supported carriers to identify and display the caller.
