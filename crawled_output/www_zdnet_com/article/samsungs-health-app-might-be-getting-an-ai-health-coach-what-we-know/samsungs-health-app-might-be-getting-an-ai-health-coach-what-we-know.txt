can't diagnose or treat medical conditions. Samsung has made major investments in its health technology, and that mission looks to be continuing with a new Health app. Samsung is rolling out an AI health coach called "Samsung Health Assistant," Android Authority found while digging around Samsung's beta on the Health app. Also: Every AI model is flunking medicine - and LMArena proposes a fixThe AI-powered assistant, presumably powered by Google's Gemini (which powers its Galaxy Watches), will reportedly answer questions on health and wellness. It offers tips and encourages users to log health data. The chatbot can't diagnose or treat medical conditions, but it can answer user questions about health, sleep, and activity-related topics. Earlier this summer, Samsung unveiled its AI-powered Running Coach feature alongside the release of its new lineup of Galaxy Watches. Running Coach takes activity data, measures running ability through a short running test, and then creates a personalized plan users can follow to achieve their desired pace or prepare for their next race. Health Assistant could suggest more content similar to Running Coach, but with other activities -- possibly swimming or cycling -- in mind. In Android Authority's screen recording of the Health Assistant beta, the AI offers a selection of activities users could participate in to increase their daily activity goals after it notices that the user's activity level is low. Samsung Health Assistant is expected to launch later this year, according to Android Authority. Also: I tested an AI-powered Running Coach on my Galaxy WatchAI-powered health assistants are a hot commodity in the wearables space. Whoop, Oura, and now Samsung all have AI-powered chatbots of their own. Google is redesigning its Fitbit experience to include one as well. There's speculation that Apple is developing one, which could see a 2026 rollout.  Upon rollout, users will be able to access the Health Assistant by clicking on the chat icon in the top right corner of the Health app. Health
