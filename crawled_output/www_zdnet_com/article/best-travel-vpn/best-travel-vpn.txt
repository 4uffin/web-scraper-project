You don't need to leave your privacy at home when you travel. A virtual private network (VPN) can keep your data safe, mask your IP address online, and provide you with protection while you're away from home. Trusted VPNs encrypt and route your traffic through dedicated networks, and you should always consider using one when you travel to avoid cyberthreats.VPNs can also circumvent censorship blocks in the country you visit, including the UK's new age verification laws, and may help you access streaming services.What is the best travel VPN right now?My pick for the best travel VPN overall is NordVPN due to its robust security, speed, and fast and reliable connections. This VPN is also a great performer in my tests when it comes to unblocking streaming services and provides a vast server network, giving you plenty of choice as to where you want to be "located" while you are online. Two-year plans begin at $3.39 per month.Alternatively, if you're willing to spend a little more at $5 per month, opt for ExpressVPN, one of the top performers in terms of speed in my experience. If you don't mind trading some speed for affordability, Surfshark is your best bet at only $2 per month.Also: The best VPNs for streaming: Expert testedAt ZDNET, we have extensively tested the best travel VPNs to help you find the best option for keeping your connections safe and secure. Our team has years of experience in the VPN market, and we understand the most important features today's VPN users want -- stability, speed, access to services, and user-friendly apps. I also perform frequent speed and security tests to ensure my recommendations stay current.Read on for all of my top picks for travel VPNs this year.

View now at NordVPN You can depend on NordVPN no matter where you're connecting from, making it my top pick as a travel VPN. Why we like it: My testing consistently found that NordVPN provides a fast and reliable connection and service across a wide range of situations.  After years of use, I've found it to be user-friendly and quick to connect. Most of the time, it can access Netflix and other popular streaming services without a problem, which is undoubtedly a benefit when traveling to ensure you never miss your favorite shows. NordVPN is one of my favorite VPNs for streaming, and it has high success rates in accessing geo-blocked content. The service also supports peer-to-peer (P2P) sharing.NordVPN also offers a second layer of encryption through its Double VPN feature and a dedicated IP bolt-on service. The company is also behind , a protocol designed for users facing VPN server connection issues due to restrictive network policies, and in a new service update, NordVPN has
spam call protection for Android users. Review: NordVPNNordVPN supports all major platforms and has Firefox, Edge, and Chrome browser plugins. The company offers 10 simultaneous device connections under one account, although I would like to see this become limitless in the future, as some cheaper services have no such restrictions.Overall, NordVPN is one of the best VPNs. The server network includes 111 countries, offering you a wide range of location options to choose from. Regarding user data, the firm's fifth independent assurance  has backed its no-logs claims. Who it's for: NordVPN will suit most users, considering its reasonable price point, excellent speeds, user-friendly and interactive user interface, and strong server network. I've found it performs well while abroad, including when connected to rather unstable Wi-Fi points.Who should look elsewhere: ExpressVPN might be the right alternative if you want server choice and security first. Want a cheaper monthly price? Check out Surfshark.Customers like that the VPN app is easy to use and offers good speeds, but some have flagged inconsistent pricing.Prices start at $3.39 per month on a standard two-year plan, and one-year plans start at $5 per month. If you also want cybersecurity protections and coverage for identity theft, consider the Prime subscription, which begins at $7.39 per month. You could also try out NordVPN by taking advantage of the organization's 30-day money-back guarantee. NordVPN is giving away Amazon gift cards worth up to $50 on some plans. NordVPN features: Simultaneous connections: 10 | Platforms: Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, Linux, Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Android TV, Fire TV, tvOS, and routers | Countries: 111 | Kill switch: Yes | Logging: Email address and billing information only | Money-back guarantee: 30 days | Trial: Seven days on Android | Trustpilot rating: 4.2 | Google Play rating: 4.6 | App Store rating: 4.7

View now at ExpressVPN ExpressVPN is a speedy, widely used VPN provider that supports many platforms and devices, making it one of my favorite VPN services for travel.Why we like it: It's not only one of the quickest VPNs on the market with minimal speed loss, but it's also one of the best VPNs for iPhones and a top VPN for Android, making it useful for traveling, especially when using multiple devices with different operating systems. The VPN's mobile app is easy to use, and I like the service's set-and-forget secure connectivity for your smartphone or tablet.Review: ExpressVPNExpressVPN has a sizable server network across 105 countries, so no matter where you are, you'll likely be able to connect to a local server. The network has recently been upgraded to include servers in all 50 U.S. states.Its apps are compatible with operating systems including Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android, and its Linux option has been updated recently to include  -- a feature long requested by users. Its Windows app has also been
following an RDP security tip.A downside is that the number of simultaneous devices you're permitted depends on your plan. The maximum is eight. Given the price point, I think this should be unlimited.ExpressVPN's  clearly outlines what information it collects. It doesn't log data that could be used to identify you, such as your IP address, browsing history, or domain name system (DNS) queries. In ExpressVPN's latest transparency , the firm disclosed 163 government, law enforcement, and civil requests for user data, one warrant, and over 800,000 Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) requests. The company said no user information was handed over.Who it's for: Individuals who want the least speed loss while using a travel VPN. Over the past few years, my tests have consistently found that ExpressVPN, together with NordVPN, performs the best in terms of speed. During long-term usage, I found that ExpressVPN offers some of the best overall speeds and stable connectivity. On rare occasions, you may need to switch servers as speeds suddenly drop, or you may encounter a website blocking your borrowed IP address -- but this is a rare occurrence and one I have also experienced with other VPNs. Customers said this VPN is pricey, but it provides good value for money, as well as solid customer support.Who should look elsewhere: Anyone who considers $4.99 per month for a VPN as too much, as there are many other more affordable VPNs on the market today, such as NordVPN and Surfshark. Two-year contracts are priced at $5 per month, with four months of free access added to the subscription term. One-year plans cost $6.67 per month with three months free. ExpressVPN accepts Google Pay and Apple Pay as payment options alongside payment cards and provides a 30-day money-back guarantee.ExpressVPN features: Simultaneous connections: 8 | Kill switch: Yes | Platforms: Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Linux, Fire TV, Android TV, tvOS, and routers | Countries: 105 | Logging: No browsing logs, some connection logs | Money-back guarantee: 30 days | Trial: Seven days on Android and iOS | Trustpilot rating: 4.1 | Google Play rating: 4.7 | App Store rating: 4.7

View now at Surfshark VPN Surfshark is an excellent option if you need a budget-friendly VPN for your trips abroad. Why we like it: Speeds are reasonable, especially when you consider the price point. They can be slower than competitors, but not to a drastic degree. This is also a beginner-friendly VPN with a clean and easy-to-understand user interface. That said, my tests have found that initial server connections can be slow. Review: Surfshark VPNI particularly like the option to disconnect or pause your VPN for five minutes, 30 minutes, or two hours. You can also select a server from 100 countries.Surfshark VPN offers many features, including split tunneling, a kill switch to keep your connection secure if it drops, double VPN MultiHop, static and rotating IP addresses, and an ad-blocker. There are also inexpensive add-ons, including a tracker-free search engine, a data breach scanner, and an antivirus.In May, Surfshark also  the launch of new domain name service (DNS) servers to provide users with additional anonymity and potentially improve connection times. Who it's for: Individuals who want an affordable, secure VPN. The company doesn't log your activity while you use the service and offers private DNS capabilities, which Surfshark calls  mode. This feature lets you access sites regardless of restrictive border connections. Be careful -- countries that limit access tend to frown upon attempts to bypass those restrictions.Surfshark subscriptions start at $2 per month for a two-year plan and $3.19 per month for a one-year plan. One- and two-year plans give customers three months of free access, which is added to the length of the contract. Surshark is also now  through the MSI Rewards Program.Alternatively, you can sign up for one month for $15.45. I don't recommend this, though -- instead, take advantage of Surfshark's 30-day money-back guarantee. Customers applaud Surfshark's customer service, but some have noted billing issues. Who should look elsewhere? If you want the best and largest server networks available when you travel, opt for one of my other VPN recommendations, some of which boast broader networks. Surfshark features: Simultaneous connections: Unlimited | Ad blocker | Two-factor authentication | Kill switch: Yes | Countries: 100 | Platforms: Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, Fire TV, Chrome, Firefox, Edge, tvOS, and routers | Money-back guarantee: 30 days | Trial: Seven days on Android, iOS, and macOS | Trustpilot rating: 4.5 | Google Play rating: 4.7 | App Store rating: 4.7

View now at Proton VPN Proton VPN, which is currently enjoying a new surge of popularity in the UK thanks to new online age verification systems imposed by the government, is my top choice for a free VPN able to help you avoid censorship.Why we like it: Swiss company Proton utilizes the slogan "privacy by default." It is focused on developing privacy-enhancing products for the general public, activists, journalists, and anyone who wants to circumvent censorship imposed in their home countries. Proton VPN takes security seriously, and all of its apps are open source, allowing anyone to examine its code for potential privacy flaws or security vulnerabilities. Review: Proton VPNIts VPN is one such product that provides users with up to 10 simultaneous connections, unless you're taking advantage of the free plan, in which you are limited to one device. The Proton VPN server network spans 117 countries, boasting over  servers. It offers peer-to-peer (P2P) and torrenting capabilities, as well as streaming support and an ad blocker. I've found the speeds to be reasonable, based on my frequent speed and stability tests. You can route your traffic through the Tor network for enhanced privacy or use WireGuard if you prefer. Proton VPN operates a no-logs policy and is independently audited. Among its other services is the NetShield ad blocker, which has been recently  to block more phishing domains. Proton VPN has also refined its mobile apps to reduce battery consumption.  Proton's attitude to security and privacy is popular with customers. Proton also offers a free VPN service that is supported by paying users. Trustpilot ratings are low, but the feedback primarily relates to the firm's free plan limits.Who it's for: Individuals looking for a travel-friendly VPN might find its new protocol, , an interesting addition. Stealth was designed to circumvent censorship by bypassing some firewalls and VPN blocking methods, such as blocking connections suspected of being VPN traffic. It's also a great option as a free travel VPN."Traditional VPN protocols (such as OpenVPN, IKEv2, and WireGuard) are relatively easy to recognize on a network," Proton VPN says. "And as deep packet inspection (DPI) technology becomes more widespread, it will be easier and easier for authoritarian governments to detect and block VPNs using these protocols."Who should look elsewhere: If speed is your top priority for streaming and gaming while you're away from home, Proton VPN might not be the right fit. Instead, consider ExpressVPN or NordVPN.Still, if Proton VPN is right for you, the best deal is $3.59 per month on a two-year plan. A one-year plan is priced at $4 per month, or you can opt for one month of access for $10. There is a 30-day money-back guarantee.Proton VPN features: Open-source | Simultaneous connections: One to 10, depending on the plan | Countries: 117 | Logging: No-logs policy | Security audits | Platforms: Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, Linux, Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Android TV, Fire TV, Kodi, and routers | VPN accelerator | Money-back guarantee: 30 days | Trial: Free option | Trustpilot rating: 2.8 | Google Play rating: 4.8 | App Store rating: 4.6

I've found the speeds to be reasonable, based on my frequent speed and stability tests. You can route your traffic through the Tor network for enhanced privacy or use WireGuard if you prefer. Proton VPN operates a no-logs policy and is independently audited. Among its other services is the NetShield ad blocker, which has been recently  to block more phishing domains. Proton VPN has also refined its mobile apps to reduce battery consumption.  Proton's attitude to security and privacy is popular with customers. Proton also offers a free VPN service that is supported by paying users. Trustpilot ratings are low, but the feedback primarily relates to the firm's free plan limits.Who it's for: Individuals looking for a travel-friendly VPN might find its new protocol, , an interesting addition. Stealth was designed to circumvent censorship by bypassing some firewalls and VPN blocking methods, such as blocking connections suspected of being VPN traffic. It's also a great option as a free travel VPN."Traditional VPN protocols (such as OpenVPN, IKEv2, and WireGuard) are relatively easy to recognize on a network," Proton VPN says. "And as deep packet inspection (DPI) technology becomes more widespread, it will be easier and easier for authoritarian governments to detect and block VPNs using these protocols."Who should look elsewhere: If speed is your top priority for streaming and gaming while you're away from home, Proton VPN might not be the right fit. Instead, consider ExpressVPN or NordVPN.Still, if Proton VPN is right for you, the best deal is $3.59 per month on a two-year plan. A one-year plan is priced at $4 per month, or you can opt for one month of access for $10. There is a 30-day money-back guarantee.Proton VPN features: Open-source | Simultaneous connections: One to 10, depending on the plan | Countries: 117 | Logging: No-logs policy | Security audits | Platforms: Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, Linux, Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Android TV, Fire TV, Kodi, and routers | VPN accelerator | Money-back guarantee: 30 days | Trial: Free option | Trustpilot rating: 2.8 | Google Play rating: 4.8 | App Store rating: 4.6

What is a travel VPN service, and why should you use one?
A travel VPN service is a
virtual private network best suited for when you leave your home country. This means it will provide you with a server network spanning multiple countries, cities, and towns, allowing you to shift your 'location' to somewhere else entirely -- bypassing internet censorship, geo-restrictions, and potentially even allowing you to access different streaming content libraries by region.Also: Best VPNs for streaming 2025: I've tested Netflix libraries worldwide so you don't have toFurthermore, a travel-ready VPN should be compatible with a variety of operating systems and devices, and it should implement strong encryption and other security measures to protect your privacy. When traveling, consider using a VPN to keep your data safe, especially if you're using unknown or public -- and untrustworthy -- internet connections.

How to use a VPN when you travel
Charlie Osborne/ZDNETTo set up a travel VPN, subscribe to a service and download the software for your device. Open the program and sign in using your credentials. Choose a server location and connect to the VPN.
Charlie Osborne/ZDNETOnce connected, your internet traffic should be encrypted, and your IP address should be hidden.Remember, you can use a VPN on different devices, including your laptop and smartphone. While you are traveling, you should enable your VPN for any online activities, regardless of whether you are using a hotel connection or a public Wi-Fi hotspot. You will always be better protected by using your cellular plan if it's available and not too expensive.Also: Best free software uninstallers of 2025Choosing the right travel VPN

Factors to consider when choosing a travel VPN
While travel-friendly VPNs can be used anytime, there are specific features that make them the strongest contenders on my travel VPN recommendations list. When you are deciding on the most suitable travel VPN, consider the following factors:Price: VPN prices vary, and although the most expensive services can cost you upwards of $10 to $20 per month, you can also find solid, reliable VPNs for as little as a few dollars per month. That said, you may be interested in paying top rates if you want additional features, such as a password manager or reliable connections in countries such as China.Trial length: You need to consider how long you think you will need a VPN. If you're in it for the long haul, consider a two-year subscription -- as you also tend to get the best monthly prices on the longest terms. Some VPNs will offer more extended options, but if you're only traveling for a month, you might be willing to pay a little extra so that you are not tied to a longer contract.Server countries: If you're going to another country, check that your VPN works there. Most VPNs work in many countries without a problem, but some areas -- such as China or Russia -- may require specific VPNs, and they typically cost more. Security: Consider the VPN provider's security track record. Preferably, the VPN will be open to external audits, and the company hasn't suffered any significant recent data breaches. You also want a VPN provider that constantly improves its security posture. Streaming: If you plan to use your VPN to access your streaming service home library, check to ensure your VPN can access your favorite platform. Switching servers often resolves issues abroad.Legality: Some countries frown upon the use of VPNs, whereas others ban them entirely. If you're going to a new country known for censorship, check the local laws first.Support: As with any subscription software, you may encounter problems with installing apps, using the service, renewing, or canceling. We list VPNs with an available support team.

How I test VPNs
Many providers recommended in this list have been subject to in-depth testing and reviews by ZDNET's team. We've been talking about VPNs for years, spoken with their management and users, and developed a generally favorable impression.I have tested and analyzed the best VPNs for travel in 2025 using the following criteria to help you make an informed decision:Performance: My top VPNs must have a minimum level of performance, especially while you're in different countries. After all, there's no point in using a VPN while streaming if your connection continually drops or lags.Testing: ZDNET tests VPN services from multiple locations, but we can't test from all locations. After all, every home, community, local ISP, and nation has a different infrastructure. Still, I test speeds, reliability, and server connections frequently, and I also take into account colleagues' experiences and independent testing. Simultaneous connections: Many VPNs limit the number of devices you can connect to a service simultaneously. If you want to connect a phone, tablet, laptop, desktop, and possibly even a smart TV to a VPN, you need a service that allows at least five simultaneous connections.Security: There's no point in using a VPN unless its security protocols and encryption levels are up to scratch. I also ensure that the development team behind each recommended VPN cares about improving security over time and patching reported bugs.Kill switch: A kill switch prevents you from having an unprotected connection. It is an important feature for a VPN, as it protects you by preventing a return to a default Wi-Fi connection should your internet connection unexpectedly drop.Geo-blocks and streaming: VPNs can be vital to accessing local content and services while you're away from home. Given these factors, we ensured that our top recommendations perform well and are unlikely to slow down your connection while you stream.Countries and servers: In how many different countries does the VPN have servers? This can include physical and virtual servers, and whether there are enough -- at least 50 or so -- to provide variety.Trial length and price: Each VPN we recommend has a solid money-back guarantee. Support: As with any subscription software, you may encounter problems installing apps, using the service, renewing, or canceling. We list VPNs with an available support team.Check out ZDNET's VPN testing methodology page for a more
comprehensive breakdown.

Latest news on VPNs in 2025Here are some of the recent and notable news stories in the VPN sector:VPN downloads have surged in response to the UK's new online age verification requirements for adult and/or "harmful" content. One VPN provider reported a 1,800% increase in downloads. A free "VPN" hosted on GitHub has been unmasked as information-stealing malware.A new study explored how Ukrainians have used VPN technologies since the start of the war.Russia's federal regulator for media and communications, Roskomnadzor, is trying to wipe out the existence of VPN apps in the Google Play Store. So far, 212 VPNs and associated services have been targeted through takedown requests. In a new report, the EU's HLG (High Level Group) formally called VPNs a "key challenge" to investigative work.Windscribe founder Yegor Sak has been acquitted after being personally charged in connection with "an alleged internet offence by an unknown user of the service." Sufficient evidence was not found to link Windscribe or Sak.Is VPN software impacted by tariff changes?
Software, including VPNs, is not usually directly impacted by tariffs. However, software does require a physical infrastructure, and the equipment required to run a VPN network, like servers, may become more expensive or difficult to acquire. In turn, this may lead to higher pricing in the future. While VPN software is not in the firing line yet, the White House's original tariff announcement became a catalyst for stock market fluctuations and the panic-buying of some consumer goods. A temporary stay of execution for tariffs on electronics is currently in place.

Travel VPN FAQs
What is a VPN?
A VPN is a virtual private network that allows you to browse the internet privately and securely, including when connecting to public Wi-Fi networks. VPNs allow you to change your virtual location by redirecting the connection through servers around the world. A VPN can also encrypt your traffic, keeping your online activities hidden from prying eyes.If your online activities are monitored at the internet service provider (ISP) level -- say, by a government -- the snoopers may recognize your VPN's "signature." While they can't see the details of what you're doing, they will know that you're using a VPN.VPNs can also be useful in unblocking geo-restricted content and can be a vital tool for accessing information in countries with repressive governments. They are essential services for anyone who wants to maintain their security and privacy online.
Show more
Will a travel VPN slow down my internet speed?
A VPN might slow your internet speed if the data is encrypted and decrypted before transmission. A good travel VPN should have a minimal impact on your speed, and the added security is worth the slight speed loss.If you use a public hotspot or hotel connection while you're away, your speed will likely be slow at the source and not as fast as you are used to at home.
Show more
What should I do if I experience traffic slowdowns with a VPN?
If you experience traffic slowdowns, check the VPN and Wi-Fi connection between your device, router, or access point. Sometimes, connectivity issues begin at the source, and in other cases, switching your selected VPN server may be enough to resolve speed problems or connectivity drops.Keep in mind that if you are on the road, and you are relying on a free hotspot or hotel connection, your base speed may be lower and might not meet the standards of your home connection.
Show more
Are travel VPNs legal?
Using a VPN is legal in most countries, but some exceptions exist. Some countries such as China, Russia, and Iran, restrict VPN usage or have banned them entirely. It's essential to research the local laws of the country you're traveling to before using a VPN.
Show more
How can I find out what the VPN rules are for the countries I'm visiting?
There are several good sources. Reaching out to your VPN vendor is always a good idea. They often have a good feel for the countries in which their services operate and will frequently post guidance on their websites.If you're a U.S. citizen, consider using U.S. State Department resources. The department lists travel advisories for U.S. citizens and has foreign service officials who can provide general guidance. Check the travel advisories webpage. Your nation's foreign ministry may have a similar service if you're outside the US.If you're trying to understand which countries ban or discourage VPN usage, NordVPN has a legal guide that lists countries with severe restrictions, bans, and possible penalties for breaking VPN laws.
Show more
Is a VPN all I need to be protected online while traveling?
No. VPNs can generally protect your data while it's in motion. If your computer or phone is seized, however, it's possible law enforcement can access your data, even if it's encrypted. Some governments might hold your devices without giving you a reason.Online services you access in another country might also have less protection than those in your host country.Also: Best antivirus for Windows of 2025
Show more
What is a DNS leak, and why does it matter?
A domain name service (DNS) leak is the exposure of your information -- such as DNS queries -- outside of secure, encrypted tunnels when you are using a VPN. If your activity is exposed, this compromises the whole point of using a virtual private network in the first place.As you can imagine, you don't want to use a travel VPN known for DNS leaks. Most reputable VPNs will prevent DNS leaks, but if you can, use an online service like DNS leak test to check your connection.
Show more
If my hotel has a wired connection, do I still need to use a VPN?
Yes. Don't assume network endpoints are safe when you're traveling. Always make sure your connections are encrypted when communicating from any network connection.

Can a VPN help me save on airfare?
Many VPN services claim you can save hundreds of dollars on flights by changing your location. Plenty of blog posts with anecdotal evidence support the theory that a VPN can help cut the price of your plane ticket. The reality is less clear, and the most likely scenario is that no one knows how much -- if at all -- a VPN can help you score cheap flights.  Airfare prices are set by algorithms based on complicated factors, such as changing demand. You could notice a price difference using a VPN to spoof your location, but the change in cost may or may not be related to your location. Practically, it isn't easy to account for every possible variable. Also, given the amount of data available to consumers, the real advantage of using a VPN may be that it remains anonymous.Another way to look at it is if a VPN reduces the cost of airfare, it's most likely not going to have as big of an impact as other factors. There are different tactics for booking cheap flights that should be higher on your priority list. Booking early, keeping an eye out for price drops, check if there are change fees before booking, or traveling during days or times of day when there is less demand are great ways to secure the best possible flight prices.
Show more
Can a VPN make it look like I am in another country?
Yes. You can choose your home country as a default location, but if you would prefer to have an IP assigned from a different country -- the U.S. rather than the U.K., for example -- you should be able to do so. The available locations vary depending on the VPN you are using.
Show more
Can I access my streaming service abroad?
If you're a paid subscriber to a streaming service, such as Netflix, Disney+, or Amazon Prime Video, you can often access your streaming service while you're away from home. You can use a VPN to change your IP address to another point of origin -- and if this is set to your home location, you should have access to your library.Using a VPN to access other libraries may go against your terms of service and the streaming platform's licensing agreements, so keep this in mind.Also: Best VPN for Fire TV Stick
Show more
Does a VPN incur roaming charges?
No. A VPN network can help you simulate and appear from a location abroad, but this doesn't mean you'll face roaming charges imposed by your carrier. Unfortunately, a VPN will also not allow you to avoid roaming charges while you're away from home.
Show more
Should I use a VPN in my home country?
Absolutely. You should consider using a VPN in your home country and abroad, as in both cases, you are still offered online protection, encrypted communication, and privacy tools. As long as VPN usage is legal, a VPN can be invaluable.
Show more
Do I pay for a VPN month by month?
VPN providers usually market their pricing on a month-to-month basis. However, you usually pay for your chosen contract upfront when you purchase. For example, a VPN available for $3 per month will likely equate to $36 upfront on a yearly contract -- plus tax. An exception is Mullvad, which offers a month-by-month €5 -- or about $5.31 -- price, no matter how long you want to use the VPN for. You tend to enjoy the best discounts on VPN contracts when you sign up for longer terms. Two years is usually the longest term you can sign up for, although some VPN providers offer five-year subscriptions.
Show more
Why are VPN one-month plans so expensive?
The simple answer is that VPN providers do not want users to pop in and out with four-week subscriptions. Instead, they hope to lure consumers with cheap one-year and two-year plans and will display the monthly equivalent price in marketing materials rather than the upfront payment. If you are interested in a VPN but don't want to pay upwards of $20 to try it out, we recommend you sign up for a longer term and take advantage of money-back guarantees. These refund windows are typically available for the first 30 days, although CyberGhost offers 45 days. You can then cancel before the end of this period.
