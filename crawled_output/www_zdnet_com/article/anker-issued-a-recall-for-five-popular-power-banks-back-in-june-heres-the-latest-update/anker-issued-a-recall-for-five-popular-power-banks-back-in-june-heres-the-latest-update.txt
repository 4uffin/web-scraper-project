Elyse Betters Picaro / ZDNETFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google. ZDNET's key takeawaysBack in June, several Anker power banks were called for safety issues.The list included the popular PowerCore 10000 power bank.We've listed the steps to follow if you own one of the recalled products.Anker has had a rough summer. Between June and July 2025, the company issued two separate recalls for a number of power banks over the past few weeks. This has prompted a question from owners of the affected power banks to ask whether they should continue using a power bank if it's been recalled. Our answer? No.Also: The best power banks you can buy in 2025Before we go into a little more depth than the above one-word answer, here's a little background. Which power banks did Anker recall?Back in mid-June, Anker, along with the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), issued a recall for the Anker A1263 PowerCore 10000 power bank because Anker had received 19 reports of fires and explosions. These reports included two for minor injuries and 11 for property damage totaling over $60,700.This was a popular power bank, with over a million units sold between June 1, 2016, and December 31, 2022, through retailers such as Amazon, Newegg, and eBay, as well as on Anker's own website.Also: Best MagSafe battery packs 2025: I tested the best options to boost your phone's batteryThen, at the end of June, Anker recalled a further five power banks -- Anker Power Bank models A1257 and A1647, the Anker MagGo Power Bank model A1652, and the Anker Zolo Power Bank models A1681 and A1689 -- because of faulty batteries. According to Anker, "the likelihood of malfunction is considered minimal," but the recall was issued "out of an abundance of caution" because of a "risk of overheating, melting, smoke, or fire."How bad was the damage?Unfortunately, more people have gotten hurt. The United States Consumer Product Safety Commission (USCPSC) issued a new, separate recall on September 18 for the five power banks from late June: models A1647, A1652, A1257, A1681, and A1689. According to the firm, the recall affects about 481,000 units in total. It even received reports that there were 33 fire and explosion incidents, four of which resulted in minor burn injuries and one that caused "substantial property damage".What should I do if I have a recalled power bank?If you've bought an Anker power bank in the past nine years, it's probably a good idea to check it. Details of the first recall can be found here, and the other five power banks here. If you have an affected unit, Anker says to stop using the power bank, get confirmation that it is affected, get your replacement or gift card sorted, and then get rid of the power bank -- but, because of the risk of the power bank overheating or bursting into flames, not in the recycling or general trash. You need to contact your local Household Hazardous Waste (HHW) collection center or consult this EPA web page to find out how to dispose of it.Also: Unplugging these 7 household devices saved me $200 a year in electricityAirlines seem to be worried. Chinese aviation regulator has banned passengers from carrying the recalled power banks and those without the Chinese "3C" certification marking (short for China Compulsory Certification), after power banks were blamed for a fire that broke out on an Air Busan plane in January and a Hong Kong Airlines flight that was forced to make an emergency landing in March.As a result, some airlines, like Singapore Airlines, are outright "banning passengers from using power banks to charge phones and personal devices in-flight." Others are being less strict. Southwest Airlines enacted a new rule, "requiring passengers to keep power banks visible when in use".
The latest power banks to be recalled by Anker. AnkerOK, but some of you still have more questions, so let me address the most popular...
Why are Anker products so prone to recalls?
In my experience, Anker has been proactive about safety, and carried out regular supply chain audits.Also: ESR's new MagSafe iPhone 17 accessories are perfect for modern professionalsRecalls are a double-edged sword. While they promote safety, they can affect a company's reputation. I think it's a good thing that a company is being open about safety issues, and I don't have any concerns about using Anker products over products from any other company.

What's the problem with Anker's recalled power banks?
Anker has said that the issue involves "lithium-ion battery cells from a single vendor," but hasn't gone into much more detail. Lumafield put affected power banks into their CT scanner to see inside and concluded that the issue wasn't defective batteries but a design flaw that allowed the positive and negative terminals of the batteries to short circuit when the power bank is knocked about in day-to-day use.

Is it safe to continue to use a recalled power bank?
While the risks are low, I wouldn't chance it. Get a replacement or a gift card, get rid of the old one, and move on.If you've never seen how fast a lithium-ion battery can go from calm to chaotic, how ferociously hot it can burn, how tricky it can be to extinguish even with the right equipment, and how quickly a burning battery can fill a room with noxious, choking fumes, you might be forgiven for thinking that it's an easily manageable situation. Also: Should you buy rechargeable batteries in 2025? These USB-C ones say yesI'm here to tell you that it isn't. I've encountered accidental runaway lithium-ion batteries twice, and both times I ended up being lightly scorched and had to sit outside for a bit to clear my lungs afterwards.And both times it could have been a lot worse.

If these power banks are dangerous, how should I store them?
A very good question, because you don't want a dangerous power bank in a drawer or on your nightstand. Despite the low risk, my advice would be to keep the affected power bank in a metal tin -- a biscuit tin or some such container -- and possibly in a garage or outbuilding, away from flammable items, until it can be handed over for disposal.

The serial number on my power bank has worn out. What do I do?
This is annoying. Try to clean the area with a soft cloth to see if the numbers will show up. Also, you can try the macro mode on your smartphone's camera.Also: This Anker Nano has become my everyday power bank - here's whyIf this doesn't work, contact Anker with the information you have.
