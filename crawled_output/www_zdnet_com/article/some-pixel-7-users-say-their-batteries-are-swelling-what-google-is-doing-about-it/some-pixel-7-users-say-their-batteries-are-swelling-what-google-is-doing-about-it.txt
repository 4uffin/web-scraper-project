CNETFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.ZDNET's key takeawaysPixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro users are seeing a rise in battery issues.The swelling is causing some phones to separate. Google is offering several remedies, including a replacement.Yet another Pixel phone is experiencing battery issues.Just a few months after the Pixel 7a had such widespread battery problems that Google offered to repair them for free, and the Pixel 6a saw overheating problems so severe at least one device caught on fire (despite an update that was designed to specifically prevent this), reports are surfacing of more Pixel battery trouble.Also: Google Pixel 10 series hands-on: I did not expect this model to be my favoriteThis time, it's the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro. In a post on the official Google support forum, a user detailed how the side panels of their two-year-old Pixel 7 Pro had started to separate. A closer look revealed that the battery was swelling, posing a significant safety risk. Dozens of other users quickly chimed in to share their similar experience with phones in the Pixel 7 series, as did users in a separate Reddit thread. For many users, the issues arise right at the two-year mark."Most phones use rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, which have a limited number of charge cycles and will eventually need to be replaced," Google said in a statement. "As such, many factors like temperature, charging and discharging, and device usage contribute to a decrease in your battery's capacity among other battery issues." What to do if your Pixel 7 or 7 Pro battery is swellingIf you're experiencing this problem, contact Google Pixel support immediately, stop using the phone, and turn it off. Several users who have already contacted Google said they had to share photos of all six sides of their phone. At least from user reports, Google seems to be responsive to the problem. Some said that Google had offered to refund the cost of a repair or replace their device entirely.In a statement, Google advised submitting a warranty claim and consulting its Help Center as next steps.Also: Changing these 10 settings on my Pixel phone gave it a nice performance boostBattery life has been an issue for Pixel phones for some time now. Not lasting through the day is one issue. Problems so serious that you're concerned about a fire are something totally different, and it's happened on multiple Pixel phones now. This is probably why the Pixel 10 came with a new mandatory battery health feature. Want to follow my work? Add ZDNET as a trusted source on Google.Featured
