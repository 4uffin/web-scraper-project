Virtual private networks (VPNs) encrypt your data and hide your internet protocol (IP) address, making them ideal solutions to reduce the risk of you being spied upon online and avoid censorship. These services route traffic through their server network, assigning users new IP locations and preventing tracking, targeted advertising, and data theft. They're often useful in accessing geo-locked streaming libraries and can help protect you while you travel. The best VPN services will protect your privacy without significantly impacting your speed. They may also offer additional privacy features, including ad-blocking, Dark Web breach alerts, data breach scanners, and password managers. Get more in-depth ZDNET tech coverage: Add us as a preferred Google source on Chrome and Chromium browsers.What is the best VPN service right now?My pick for the best overall VPN is NordVPN. Based in Panama and subject to strict data protection laws, NordVPN is a top contender in the VPN space. NordVPN offers the full package -- fast speeds, stable connections, an expansive server network, and excellent streaming capabilities. It's not the cheapest VPN, starting at $3.09 per month, but if you want a solid, versatile VPN backed by solid customer support, NordVPN is for you. My second choice is ExpressVPN, a secure and user-friendly VPN that offers some of the best speeds for global servers. Expect to pay $3.49 per month on a two-year plan, although you also receive four months of free service on signup.Also: The best VPNs for streaming: Expert testedThe ZDNET team has decades of experience in the VPN arena, and I've personally tested all the best services. I rigorously evaluate them through frequent speed tests and rank them based on the number of servers, security features, and price. If you're interested in signing up for a VPN, pick a trustworthy service that doesn't vastly impact your speed or internet connection. You should also consider the size and variety of its server network, whether or not it's right for streaming, and how the VPN provider treats user data. Read on to find the best VPN for you in 2025.

View now at NordVPN NordVPN is one of the most widely used VPNs, and for most users, it ticks all the boxes. It's secure, fast, suitable for streaming, and has all the features you'll likely need. Why we like it: NordVPN is fine for basic use but offers many features beyond a mere VPN tunnel including support for peer-to-peer (P2P) sharing and an optional second layer of encryption through Double VPN. This allows you to set up a dedicated IP address to run a VPN that also acts as a server. I've found it to be one of the fastest VPNs with the most consistent speed measurements and rapid initial server connectivity. It's still worth noting that rival ExpressVPN is slightly faster in some cases, averaging out at higher speeds with long-distance servers -- although NordVPN performs better when you use smart, local servers. In my tests with Netflix, NordVPN emerged as a top VPN for streaming content with a high success rate in accessing geo-blocked content. When set up with the Privacy Hero 2 router, it also did exceptionally well in accessing streaming services worldwide. This year, the company launched , a new protocol designed to allow users to connect to VPN servers from networks that typically limit traditional VPN traffic and have restrictive network policies. In a new service update, its macOS and Windows apps have also been refreshed. Sadly, the interactive map is now gone, but it is a much cleaner interface than before.NordVPN has a kill switch that activates if your connection suddenly drops, protecting your connection and data. There's also a handy pause function if you need to access a local website or service and revert back to your original IP address. In its fifth independent , NordVPN says its no-logs policy has been verified. Review: NordVPN: Consistent speed and performanceWho it's for: Those who want the best overall VPN around. It's a solid, fast VPN to use across different devices, and for a relatively affordable price. NordVPN is compatible with all major platforms and provides a server network of 111 countries, and it allows you to connect 10 devices simultaneously under one account. It's also excellent for streaming.Who should look elsewhere: NordVPN will suit most users' needs, but if you want speed first in faraway servers, ExpressVPN is the right alternative.You can pick between three types of plans with two-year, one-year, or one-month contract terms, depending on whether you want advanced features such as a password manager, data breach scanner, cloud storage, or file encryption.Prices start at $3.09 per month on a two-year plan or $5 per month for a one-year subscription. Three months of free access are included with two-year contracts. Alternatively, you can try out NordVPN for a month and take advantage of the organization's 30-day money-back guarantee. NordVPN features: Simultaneous connections: 10 | Platforms: Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, Linux, Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Android TV, Fire TV, tvOS, and routers | Countries: 111 | Kill switch: Yes | Logging: Email address and billing information only | Money-back guarantee: 30 days | Trial: Seven days on Android | Trustpilot rating: 4.2 | Google Play rating: 4.6 | App Store rating: 4.7

View now at ExpressVPN ExpressVPN is my top choice for the fastest VPN service around. Why we like it: Customers say it delivers a speedy and consistent connection, and I agree. NordVPN and ExpressVPN are well-matched in terms of speed, but ExpressVPN often outperforms its closest competitor when it comes to servers at a distance.It's one of the most popular, trusted VPN providers, offering a wide range of platforms. The service also has an expansive network with servers in 105 countries and has recently
to include servers in every U.S. state. I also find it works well for streaming purposes. Compatible platforms include Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, Fire OS, and tvOS. The service also works with Linux, which has been  with a new user interface. In total, 10 to 14 simultaneous connections can be linked under a single account. Although this has recently increased from eight, I would still like to see it become unlimited one day. Review: ExpressVPN: Is it worth the price?The company doesn't log your browsing history, IP address, or traffic destination and operates a no-logs policy. In ExpressVPN's latest transparency , the firm received 163 government, law enforcement, and civil requests for user data, one warrant, and over 800,000 Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) requests, but says no user information was handed over.While customer service is friendly and polite, they persist in customer retention, so you'll need to set aside some time if you wish to cancel after the 30-day period. Who it's for: Individuals who see speed as king. This VPN has consistently secured the top spot in my speed tests over the past few years. Considering my recent switch to fiber, it is still one of the fastest around with minimal speed loss.ExpressVPN is also the developer of Aircove, a router product line with ExpressVPN built in, saving you the legwork if you want blanket coverage for all your home devices. Alternatively, you can manually set up ExpressVPN to work with gaming consoles and TVs that do not natively support VPN apps, but you may need to install the VPN directly on your router.ExpressVPN has recently switched to a  system -- a move I applaud, as it gives VPN customers the range of choice they now expect -- and this makes it more affordable. The best deal is the basic plan, which is $3.49 per month on a two-year contract, with four months of free access thrown in. The provider also offers Advanced and Pro subscriptions, available from $6 per month and $9 per month, respectively, on a two-year term. These more expensive tiers include ExpressVPN's ad-blocker, 12 simultaneous connections rather than 10, a password manager, and a discount on the ExpressVPN Aircove router. There is a 30-day money-back guarantee. Who should look elsewhere: VPN customers who want the most budget-friendly option should consider Surfshark or another of my recommended, cheaper VPNs. ExpressVPN features: Simultaneous connections: 8 | Kill switch: Yes | Platforms: Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Linux, Fire TV, Android TV, tvOS, and routers | Countries: 105 | Logging: No browsing logs, some connection logs | Money-back guarantee: 30 days | Trial: Seven days on Android and iOS | Trustpilot rating: 4.0 | Google Play rating: 4.7 | App Store rating: 4.7

View now at Surfshark VPN Surfshark should be on your radar if you are looking for an affordable, attractively presented VPN for the long term.Why we like it: In ZDNET's Surfshark VPN review and testing, I found that this VPN offers reasonable speeds and a decent server network. It's not the fastest option or the quickest to initially connect, but the cheap price point provides excellent value for money and makes this VPN stand out as a mid-range, starter option.With a server network spanning 100 countries, you have plenty of locations to choose from, making this VPN a good choice for streaming content at home or abroad. Surfshark prioritizes security with AES-256-GCM, Perfect Forward Secrecy, and RSA-2048 encryption. The organization also upholds a no-logs policy, which
several months ago. There are also no data leaks, according to my recent tests, which is precisely what you want to see from a quality VPN. Also: NordVPN vs Surfshark: Which is better?I like its add-on features, including anti-tracking, a search engine that doesn't log your information, and a scanner that checks data breach lists for your email. With Surfshark's multi-hop option, you can also connect through two VPN servers. The company has also recently debuted , a route optimization system that may, in time, vastly improve its connection speeds. Customers praise the support team for being excellent and quick to respond.Who it's for: Anyone on the hunt for a consistently affordable VPN without any unwelcome price hikes. I've tested Surfshark for years and its pricing typically stays within the $2 - $3 per month mark. The cheapest option, a two-year subscription called Surfshark Starter, costs only $2 per month at the time of writing. Alternatively, you can sign up for one year and pay $3.19 per month or $15.45 for just one month of access. One- and two-year contracts include three months of free access and a 30-day money-back guarantee.Who should look elsewhere: Surfshark provides excellent value for money, but it isn't the fastest or the most advanced VPN. If you want the best speeds or advanced customization, check out my other recommendations, including NordVPN and ExpressVPN.Surfshark features: Simultaneous connections: Unlimited | Ad-blocker | Two-factor authentication | Kill switch: Yes | Countries: 100 | Platforms: Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, Fire TV, Chrome, Firefox, Edge, tvOS, and routers | Money-back guarantee: 30 days | Trial: Seven days on Android, iOS, and macOS | Trustpilot rating: 4.4 | Google Play rating: 4.7 | App Store rating: 4.7

View now at Proton VPN Proton is a Swiss company that adheres to the country's strict privacy laws and also provides a free VPN service. It's pretty quick, too.Why we like it: Under the slogan "privacy by default," this organization is focused on developing services -- including encrypted email and a VPN -- to enhance the privacy of activists, journalists, and the public.Proton VPN adopts a strong approach to security, layering advanced protocols on top of encryption and customization options. Not only does Proton VPN have a kill switch, but it also provides torrenting support and an ad-blocker. All of Proton's apps are open-source, there's a no-logs policy, and the company reports that it is independently audited. The firm has also created its own protocol, , which has been designed to circumvent censorship blocks. If you head into settings, you can choose between WireGuard, Stealth, and IKEv2.Among its other services is the NetShield ad-blocker, which was  in May to block more phishing domains. Proton VPN has also refined its mobile apps to reduce battery consumption.  Customers like Proton's attitude to security and privacy. I find it easy to use, and the paid versions' speeds are very good in local locations, and not reasonable when you choose a long-distance server. Although Trustpilot ratings are low, the feedback primarily relates to the firm's free plan limits and customer support system.There are free and paid options available, and if you need a free solution, this is one of the few trusted VPNs I recommend. Review: Proton VPNWho it's for: Proton offers a free VPN service that is supported by paid users.

Proton is a Swiss company that adheres to the country's strict privacy laws and also provides a free VPN service. It's pretty quick, too.Why we like it: Under the slogan "privacy by default," this organization is focused on developing services -- including encrypted email and a VPN -- to enhance the privacy of activists, journalists, and the public.Proton VPN adopts a strong approach to security, layering advanced protocols on top of encryption and customization options. Not only does Proton VPN have a kill switch, but it also provides torrenting support and an ad-blocker. All of Proton's apps are open-source, there's a no-logs policy, and the company reports that it is independently audited. The firm has also created its own protocol, , which has been designed to circumvent censorship blocks. If you head into settings, you can choose between WireGuard, Stealth, and IKEv2.Among its other services is the NetShield ad-blocker, which was  in May to block more phishing domains. Proton VPN has also refined its mobile apps to reduce battery consumption.  Customers like Proton's attitude to security and privacy. I find it easy to use, and the paid versions' speeds are very good in local locations, and not reasonable when you choose a long-distance server. Although Trustpilot ratings are low, the feedback primarily relates to the firm's free plan limits and customer support system.There are free and paid options available, and if you need a free solution, this is one of the few trusted VPNs I recommend. Review: Proton VPNWho it's for: Proton offers a free VPN service that is supported by paid users. It allows one machine to connect without bandwidth limits and provides access to servers across five countries. I don't typically recommend using free VPNs, but if you want a service for casual browsing, you should consider this one. Unlike many less reputable free VPN services, it will not sell your information.

View now at Private Internet Access VPN Private Internet Access (PIA) is an open source VPN solution with a solid security background. Why we like it: Private Internet Access is an excellent option if you need a VPN long-term, support for multiple devices, and you like a service that's mostly open source. When software is open source, this means that anyone can investigate its code for vulnerabilities or hidden, nasty surprises.The service offers unlimited simultaneous connections, is compatible with various operating systems and devices, and also includes a free email breach monitor.Review: Private Internet AccessPIA's network isn't the largest, with only 91 country options available, but customers note that the VPN is quick to install and simple to use. However, my testing found that server speeds -- both download and upload -- can be slow, and it tends to fall behind its competitors in this aspect. If you're using fiber, this won't be nearly as noticeable as if you have low broadband speeds.I also like the "snooze" button that temporarily turns off the VPN, as well as a tab displaying security elements, including port connections, protocols, and data encryption standards in use. You can also opt for a dedicated IP address or an antivirus scanner as a part of your package.Who it's for: PIA offers excellent security, given that it's open source, and so security-conscious individuals should consider it. Much of the VPN's code can be examined and audited publicly, which is always desirable when trusting your security to a third-party vendor. A strict no-logs policy also exists, and PIA publishes frequent transparency reports. In its latest , PIA said it received seven subpoenas and a number of government requests, but no user logs were produced. Who should look elsewhere: If streaming, speed, or a large server network are more important than open source technologies, consider another option.Private Internet Access offers two plans, including a two-year subscription for $2.19 per month, making it a very affordable VPN. The best deal is the two-year subscription, as you also get two months of free access. If you want to try out the VPN for a shorter period, you can sign up for $7.50 per month for six months. Private Internet Access VPN features: Simultaneous connections: Unlimited | Kill switch: Yes | Platforms: Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, Linux, Chrome, Firefox, Edge, tvOS, routers, Fire TV, and NAS | Countries: 91 | Logging: No-logs policy | Money-back guarantee: 30 days | Trial: Seven days on Android and iOS | Trustpilot rating: 4.2 | Google Play rating: 4.5 | App Store rating: 4.7

How do I test the best VPNs?
I ran a series of speed and connectivity tests in September 2025 on each VPN's paid service to see how they compare.I performed the tests using a fiber connection in the U.K., with an average starting speed, without a VPN, of 691.97 Mbps download and 102.11 Mbps upload. Each smart location and U.S. connection test was repeated three times, and I then calculated the average. On the rare occasion, I encountered an extreme outlier such as horrendous speeds on a specific server outside of the norm. In these instances, I repeated the test, as servers may sometimes be experiencing errors or undergoing maintenance. I also tested for the presence of domain name service (DNS) leaks.Previously, I performed repeated tests using a broadband connection in the U.K. with an average starting speed, without a VPN, of between 50 and 60 Mbps download and around 15 to 20 Mbps upload. This gave me a strong indicator of which VPNs tend to work best with slower initial broadband speeds.Please remember that results may differ for you and vary from country to country, so the below should be considered a snapshot. Your internet service provider (ISP) and broadband subscription may also impact your speeds. The results below are not the exact speeds you should expect. You can instead use these results to get a general idea of how your speeds could change with a VPN. Remember that the further away the VPN server, the more your speed may be impacted. Speeds will typically be quicker when you connect to a local server, compared to selecting Australia, for example, unless you're in the country.

Which is the right VPN for you?
Choose this top VPN service...If you want...NordVPNThe best VPN overall. NordVPN is one of the most consistently fast and stable VPN providers with a solid and large server network, giving you plenty of countries to connect to. It's great for streaming and travel, too, with a stylish user interface on PC and mobile.ExpressVPNOne of the fastest VPNs with a large server network. I've used ExpressVPN for years, and I consider it one of the fastest and least obtrusive services available. You can expect multi-platform support and relatively minor speed downgrades when you are streaming. However, it isn't cheap.Surfshark VPNThe least expensive top VPN, based on my testing. Surfshark is a consistent entrant in my top VPN lists, and for good reason. It might not always be the fastest, but for the price point, you can't argue against its value for money. It's also perfect for beginners.Proton VPNA variety of add-on features and the comfort of open-source security. Proton VPN is one of the most privacy-focused VPN services out there. It offers reasonable speeds and is one of the few trusted providers out there that also provides users with a free plan.Private Internet AccessUnlimited simultaneous connections. Private Internet Access is a great choice if you want a set-and-forget, affordable VPN, but the interface won't suit everyone. Still, this VPN will support and protect as many devices as you like under one account, including your PC, smartphone, and even your smart TV.

Factors to consider when choosing a VPN service
These are the most important factors to consider when selecting a new VPN service.Speed: Every VPN performs differently, and every user experience differs. Your ISP will offer speeds that are not the same as someone in another location. When you are testing a new VPN, keep your base speed in mind. Look out for VPN solutions with minimal speed loss.Apps: VPN providers should offer compatibility for multiple platforms and operating systems. Take a look at the user interfaces, features, and compatibility offered by your chosen VPN provider before you commit.Simultaneous connections: If you're paying for a VPN, you might want to use it across multiple devices such as a desktop PC, smartphone, or smart TV. We recommend you sign up for a plan supporting at least six devices, and thankfully, most paid plans now offer at least this number.Trial periods: Before committing to a VPN provider, test them out, that's what money-back guarantees are for. Remember that most VPN providers will give you 30 days to cancel and secure a refund. Some even offer up to 45 days.Free VPN providers: Running a VPN is expensive. If the VPN provider doesn't make money from your service fees, they're going to make money from your data -- sometimes even by selling your personal information. Stick with the trusted commercial vendors we've tested or the handful of free plans we recommend. There are also cases where "free" VPNs undermine what the software is designed for -- data protection and security. Contract terms: VPN providers constantly offer discounts, typically on longer-term plans. Consider the fine print before you sign up. Remember to cancel before automatic renewal if you're no longer happy with the service or want to switch to a cheaper deal elsewhere. Use cases: Your VPN selection should relate to how you want to use a VPN. For example, you may want one specifically for streaming geo-locked content, or you may need a VPN that is likely to work in restricted countries. Consider these points before making your final choice and test them out during your money-back-guarantee time period to ensure the VPN is right for you.Advanced features: You might like the idea of bundling your new VPN with antivirus software, a data breach alert tool, or a password manager. Check out the advanced features offered under different plans to make the right choice.

How to use a VPN
Charlie Osborne | ZDNETIf you're interested in using a VPN, setting up the service will depend on the VPN provider, your contract, and the devices you want to protect. To set up a VPN, you will first need to subscribe to a VPN service and download the VPN software. You can visit the VPN service's official website, or you may receive a download link through email. Alternatively, visit Google Play or the App Store for mobile app options. Open the software, provide any associated permissions the VPN needs, and sign in using your credentials.
ZDNET | Charlie OsborneChoose a server location and connect to the VPN. In this example, you can select ExpressVPN's "..." button to select a server from its list of countries. Most VPNs will give you a "smart" location set as default, typically close to home. Also: Best VPNs for Smart TVsIt's that simple! Of course, you can check out your VPN's settings and tailor your experience to your liking. However, for many users, sticking to default options and having a few favorite servers will be enough.How I test VPNs
I tested and analyzed the best VPNs in 2025 using the following criteria to help you make an informed decision:Performance: My top VPNs must have a minimum level of performance. After all, there's no point in using a VPN while streaming if your connection continually drops or lags. I frequently conduct speed tests to stay up to date and informed of any service changes. I have extensively tested these VPNs with low broadband and high fiber initial speeds. Simultaneous connections: Many VPNs limit the number of devices you can connect to a service simultaneously. If you have a phone, tablet, laptop, desktop, and possibly even a smart TV, and want to connect to a VPN, you need a service that allows at least six simultaneous connections.Security: A VPN's security protocols and encryption levels must stay up to scratch. I want a recommended VPN's development team to prioritize security improvements over time and promptly address reported bugs, and I look for evidence of transparency around security updates.Kill switch: A kill switch prevents you from using an unprotected connection. This is an important feature for a VPN, as it protects you by preventing a return to a default Wi-Fi connection should your internet connection unexpectedly drop. All of my recommended VPNs provide this feature.Geo-blocks and streaming: VPNs can be key to accessing local content and services while you're away from home. I ensured that our top recommendations perform well given these factors and are unlikely to slow down your connection while you are streaming. Platforms: What systems and devices can you run the VPN on? My VPN recommendations have to offer easy-to-use and intuitive desktop software for at least Windows and macOS, alongside mobile apps.Countries and servers: In how many different countries does the VPN have servers? This can include physical and virtual servers, and whether there are enough -- at least 50 or so -- to provide variety.Trial length and price: Each VPN I recommend has a solid money-back guarantee of at least 30 days, and many will offer mobile users a seven-day trial.Support: As with any subscription software, you may encounter problems installing apps, using the service, renewing, or canceling. I list VPNs with a support team available, although the communication channels on offer may vary.For a more extensive breakdown, check out ZDNET's comprehensive VPN testing methodology page.

As a further consequence, Proton VPN observed an 8,000% spike in downloads as residents attempted to reconnect to their social media.A free VPN extension is reportedly taking screenshots of user activity, including the websites they visit.The U.K.'s new and controversial Online Safety Act sparked a surge in VPN downloads.BulletVPN closed its doors, leaving some lifetime subscribers out in the cold. Windscribe stepped in to offer some users a complimentary six-month subscription. A free "VPN" hosted on GitHub was unmasked as information-stealing malware.Roskomnadzor, Russia's federal media agency and regulator, sent a wave of VPN takedown requests to Google in an apparent effort to wage war against VPN use in the country. Is VPN software impacted by tariffs?
Recent tariff changes have not directly impacted Virtual Private Network software. Software is rarely considered in tariff alterations, and so subscription services should be safe, for now. However, this doesn't mean the industry as a whole will not be impacted, as associated hardware -- such as servers and networking equipment -- could be subject to higher costs, and this may be passed on to consumers.

What is a VPN?
VPN, short for virtual private network, lets you browse the internet privately and connect
securely to open or public Wi-Fi networks. A VPN allows you to change your virtual location by redirecting the connection through one of its servers worldwide. A VPN encrypts your traffic, hiding you from hackers, internet service providers, and governments.If your online activities are being monitored at the internet service provider (ISP) level -- say, by a government -- they may recognize the signature of a VPN, even if exactly what you are doing is hidden.VPNs are useful in unblocking geo-restricted content and can be vital tools for accessing information in countries with repressive governments. They are important services for anyone who wants to maintain a high level of safety and privacy online. Because they are anonymous -- or at least should be -- they can also be used to hide illegal online activities, such as pirating content.

How can I tell if my VPN is working or not?
A fully functional VPN should protect your privacy and mask your location and IP address. If you're unsure if your VPN is working correctly, there are tools that make checking your service's performance easy.You can find out your IP address and location by using whatismyipaddress.com. Compare the IP address and location when you're connected with and without a VPN. If they are different, then your VPN is doing its job.It's possible that your VPN is leaking your data and potentially exposing your online activity. You can run tests on a site like DNS Leak Test to ensure your VPN has no issues with domain name service (DNS) leaks or IP leaks. Plenty of tools allow you to test for leaks, but VPN providers own many, and it may not always be clear who developed the tool, which could be a conflict of interest. You may want to run tests using different sites and compare the results.
Show more
Do I need a VPN if I'm traveling or using a Wi-Fi hotspot?
If you're traveling or using the internet in a public place like a coffee shop, data encryption is critical. Most public Wi-Fi hotspots are open and unencrypted, and this means anyone on the network can see what you send and may be able to eavesdrop on your activities or steal passwords.

Native VPN support on Mac
If you're connecting to an existing corporate virtual private network, you may not need an additional service. MacOS comes with built-in native VPN support, although most consumers won't need to adjust these settings.If you do, head over to System Settings, then the Network tab, and either import the configuration file you were provided or hit the plus button and add a VPN interface. Here's a handy tip sheet from Apple that will walk you through the process.

Native VPN support on Windows
If you're connecting to an established corporate VPN, all you need to do is add a new Windows VPN connection. Click the Start button, type settings, then select Settings, Network and Internet, VPN, and then Add VPN. Make sure you have the connection details provided by your work, and then click on "Add a New VPN Connection." Fill in the form and you're good to go. Here's a tip sheet from Microsoft with more information.Windows also allows you to host a VPN server by creating a new incoming network connection, choosing the users who can connect, and telling Windows that the incoming connection is across the internet. You'll also have to configure your router to allow traffic to your computer.

Do I need a VPN for my smart TV?
It probably isn't worth it to invest in a VPN purely for use with your TV. You'll find that only some TV operating systems natively support VPN apps, whereas others -- such as Tizen -- do not, which means you will have to find a workaround, such as installing a VPN on your router or Amazon TV Firestick. That said, if you want to use a VPN to access different streaming service libraries, a VPN provides the means to do so. This is a legally gray area, and you may only be able to access universally licensed content if VPN use is detected. Also: The best smart TV VPNs of 2025: Expert tested

What's the best free VPN service?
I've highlighted paid services in this article, although some offer a free tier or a money-back guarantee during a trial period. For more, check out my picks for the best VPN free trials. In general, I don't recommend most entirely free VPN services because they may not be secure.Operating a good VPN service requires hundreds of servers worldwide and vast networking resources. If you're not paying to support that infrastructure, who is? Probably advertisers or data miners. If you use a free service, your data will probably be sold. You wouldn't want your data to go to some company to sift through, it completely defeats the purpose of a VPN.Before you choose a VPN service, free or paid, know that no single tool can guarantee your privacy. Anything can be compromised. A VPN protects your data from your computer to the VPN service. It doesn't protect what you put on servers. It doesn't protect your data from the VPN provider's VPN servers to whatever site or cloud-based application you use. Privacy and security require you to be diligent throughout your digital journey, and VPNs, while helpful, are not a miracle cure.That said, if you would like to explore free options, I have compiled a guide of the best free VPNs available.
Show more
How much does a VPN cost?
A VPN's cost can vary depending on your needs. Basic plans often cost a few dollars per month, but pricing structures are often displayed as monthly equivalents, so you may have to pay upfront for the full contract at sign-up. Tax may also be added. If you need a specialized VPN, such as one able to circumvent blocks in countries like China, expect to pay more. Overall, expect to pay between $2 - $10 per month.
Show more
Why are month-to-month VPN plans so expensive?
In my opinion, VPN providers usually set extortionate pricing on one-month subscriptions to deter customers from opting for these plans. While most VPNs are available month-to-month, they are usually priced at over $10 per month and aren't great value compared to one-year and two-year plans. The exception is Mullvad, which operates on a set monthly price, no matter how long you want the VPN for. We recommend that you choose a VPN for a longer term, as you will pay less. You can use a VPN's 30-day money-back guarantee to see if the VPN suits you, or cancel before this period ends to receive a full refund.

Should you use a VPN on your phone or tablet?
If it's your data, and you want it to be secure, yes. The same choices are valid regardless of what kind of device you use to transmit and receive data over the internet.Also: The best mobile VPNs
Show more
Is it legal to use a VPN?
Yes, in most countries, including the U.S., the U.K., and the majority of Europe. In some countries, VPNs are illegal, or severely discouraged and limited to state-approved software.At the moment, countries including North Korea, Iraq, and Belarus have reportedly banned the use of VPNs entirely. As noted in NordVPN's country guide, others -- like China, Russia, and Egypt -- discourage VPN use and try to stop new adoption by demonizing VPNs as software widely used for criminal activity.Workarounds do exist, but they may come with risks.
Show more
Should I leave a VPN on all of the time?
We recommend that you do because a VPN provides a blanket layer of protection for your online activities. If speed loss is problematic during some activities like gaming, at least use one during sensitive activities like accessing financial accounts. You should also always use a VPN when connecting to public Wi-Fi hotspots.
Show more
Do VPN providers limit usage?
Some do, so check when you sign up. For non-free plans, none of the providers I recommended limit the amount of data you can use. Some will limit how many devices you can use at once, but for paid plans VPN providers tend to offer more connections than you will need. As a general rule of thumb, free or trial offerings tend to restrict usage, speed, and/or the number of devices you can connect to the VPN, with access and speed increased for paying customers.
Show more
What does logging mean with regards to VPN services?
Logging is the recording of data about your usage, and it occurs everywhere. Every website, at minimum, records an IP address, time, and data accessed so they can track traffic. All VPN providers have to check credentials against recorded personal data to make sure you paid, but some let you sign up with Bitcoin, allowing you to hide your identity.When I say a VPN doesn't log data, I mean they don't track which sites you visit and for how long, but they may track how much of their infrastructure you use.
Show more
What is a VPN kill switch?
Let's say you're surfing online, and your VPN connection suddenly fails. Your phone or computer will likely immediately try to reconnect and do so directly without going through a VPN. All of a sudden, your data is unprotected.A kill switch is a feature in your device's VPN app that detects when a connection fails and immediately shuts down network access. It's not a 100% perfect solution, but we wouldn't recommend using a VPN that doesn't offer a kill switch.
Show more
What are simultaneous connections, and why should I care?
When you have multiple devices -- such as a tablet, a laptop, and a smartphone -- and you are using these devices for different tasks, you still want to keep your data and connections secure on each machine.When you have enabled the VPN on more than one device at the same time, you are using simultaneous connections. It's always best to have this feature in a VPN to ensure your privacy isn't accidentally compromised through one device or another.
Show more
Does a VPN slow down your connection?
Using a VPN can often slow down your connection because your data is encrypted, decrypted, and sent through intermediate servers. Game responsiveness might suffer, for example, or you may notice your streaming service doesn't load as fast as usual.However, much depends on the quality of your initial connection. For example, you might encounter buffering issues on a low-speed broadband connection, but you wouldn't notice any change when you are using fiber -- even with the same VPN.With many high-quality VPNs now available, however, the negative impact is often unnoticeable, unless there is a problem with the VPN server you connect to. To fix this, try a server in a different location and see if that improves your connection.
Show more
What about protocol acronyms?
If you've been shopping for a VPN service, you've undoubtedly come across a bunch of names like SSL, OpenVPN, SSTP, L2TP/IPSec, PPP, PPTP, IKEv2/IPSec, Stealth, and SOCKS5. These are all communication protocols. Essentially, they're the method's name by which your communication is encrypted and packaged for tunneling to the VPN provider. While VPN enthusiasts can argue over protocols for hours, it's probably good enough to use the default setup from your provider.

What VPNs should I avoid?
You should avoid VPNs without a long-term customer base or strong customer feedback. Shady VPNs may offer you free services, but they may store or sell your information in return. You should also avoid VPN providers with known security problems and a lack of transparency around resolving them.

Will my VPN increase in price?
VPN providers often join in during sales events and offer holiday promotions, reducing the price of a subscription by a few dollars or more. The price will often jump after your promotional period ends, whether this is for an annual plan or a two-year contract. Remember to watch when your subscription ends to avoid costly renewal payments. It might be better to turn off auto-renewal and then sign back up.

Do I pay for a VPN monthly or yearly?
Typically, VPN providers model their pricing on a monthly basis, but you may have to pay for your contract upfront when you make your purchase. For example, a VPN available for $2 per month will likely equate to $24 upfront on a yearly contract, plus tax. One of the only exceptions in the market at the moment is Mullvad, which offers a month-by-month price. You enjoy the best discounts when signing up for longer terms. Two years is usually the longest term you can sign up for, although some VPN providers offer five-year subscriptions.

What does a VPN not hide?
A VPN encrypts your traffic. This means the websites you visit and your online communication, as well as your original IP address. However, a VPN may not be able to hide that you are using a VPN, nor does it hide your device's physical details or information you may submit to a service, such as when you make a financial transaction.
