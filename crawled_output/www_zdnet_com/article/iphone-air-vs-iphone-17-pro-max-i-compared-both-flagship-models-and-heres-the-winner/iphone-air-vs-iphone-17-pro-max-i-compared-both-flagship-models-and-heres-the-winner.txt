iPhone Air vs. iPhone 17 Pro Max: I compared both flagship models, and here's the winner
The iPhone Air and iPhone 17 Pro Max are two extremes that elevate Apple's handsets to a new level. So which one should you get?

Jason Hiner/ZDNETFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.Apple's iPhone 17 lineup brings some of the biggest design changes the smartphone series has seen in years, and no two models better highlight this shift than the iPhone Air and iPhone 17 Pro Max. The iPhone Air is one of the thinnest smartphones Apple has ever made, made for those who value a sleek, portable design. Meanwhile, the iPhone 17 Pro Max doubles down on power with a cutting-edge camera system and a new vapor chamber cooling system.Also: iPhone 17 Pro vs. iPhone 15 Pro: I compared both models, and here's who should upgradeBoth devices are great, but they cater to different audiences. The question of the day is: Which one should you get as your new daily driver? It's hard to choose, but don't worry -- I'm here to help. Below, I've broken down how the iPhone Air compares to the iPhone 17 Pro Max.SpecificationsFeaturesiPhone 17 AiriPhone 17 Pro MaxPrices$999$1,199Display6.5-inch Super Retina XDR with ProMotion6.9-inch Super Retina XDR with ProMotionBattery27 hours of video playback  39 hours of video playback  FinishesSky Blue, Black, White, Light GoldCosmic Orange, Deep Blue, SilverProcessorA19 ProA19 ProFrameTitanium frameAluminum unibodyStorage256GB, 512GB, 1TB256GB, 512GB, 1TB, 2TBCamera18MP Center Stage selfie / 48MP Fusion Main18MP Center Stage / 48MP Fusion Main, 48MP Fusion Ultra Wide, 48MP Fusion Telephoto

Jason Hiner/ZDNET1. You want an ultrathin yet tough phoneAt just 5.6 mm thick, the iPhone Air is nearly a third thinner than the iPhone 16 Pro. Although it appears fragile, it's anything but, as Apple designed its mobile device to be just as durable as it is elegant. The smartphone's frame is made of grade 5 titanium, a material known for its high strength and "corrosion-resistant characteristics." Also: 3 reasons why I'm skipping the iPhone 17 Pro and buying this model insteadCeramic Shield protects the back of the iPhone Air, allowing it to better resist damage. On the front, Apple chose to equip the screen with Ceramic Shield 2. Thanks to this material, Apple says the display has "3x better scratch resistance" than previous models and "improved anti-reflection" properties.
2. You don't need every bell and whistleAs I mentioned in my iPhone 17 series comparison piece, the iPhone Air isn't as feature-rich as the higher-end models. This may be a controversial opinion, but I think the device's lack of bells and whistles will benefit users as they'll receive a more streamlined experience. For instance, it only has a single 48MP Fusion lens as its rear camera system. According to Apple, it enables the equivalent of four lenses with users able to shoot photographs in both 28mm and 35mm focal lengths. You won't have to fiddle around with the settings or learn what the cameras do. It's all condensed.Also: iPhone Air vs. Samsung S25 Edge: I compared both thin phones, and there's a clear winnerAnother change relates to cellular connectivity. The iPhone Air relies exclusively on eSIM technology. Carriers continue to increase support for eSIM at a consistent rate, so this isn't too big a detriment, but this does mean that you won't be able to use your SIM card. Apple has also said that the adoption of an "eSIM-only design" allowed the company to save space, helping the iPhone Air achieve that thin form factor.

1. You want the most powerful iPhoneThe iPhone 17 Pro Max shares a surprising number of similarities with the iPhone Air. Both devices run on a three-chip setup, which consists of the A19 Pro processor, N1 networking chip, and C1X modem. Together, this trio allows the smartphones to deliver powerful performance, support Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 6, and offer faster, more energy-efficient cellular connections.Also: T-Mobile will give you a free iPhone 17 Pro - here's how to get yoursWhere the Pro Max differentiates itself is in size and stamina. Its massive 6.9-inch Super Retina XDR display hits 3,000 nits of brightness, ensuring visibility under direct sunlight. Support for ProMotion lets it run at a refresh rate of 120Hz for smooth visuals. The glass is even protected by Ceramic Shield 2. Paired with a battery reportedly capable of lasting up to 39 hours of video playback, it is the iPhone built for users who want the best of the best.
2. You want the best camera systemThe similarities between the two phones don't stop at the chipset or displays because they also have similar camera systems. For example, both models have the new 18MP Center Stage selfie lens. Not only does it provide higher-quality images, but it also uses a new type of sensor that lets owners capture photos in both portrait and landscape orientations without needing to rotate their phone.Also: Every iPhone that can be updated to iOS 26 (and when you can install it)The iPhone 17 Pro Max differentiates itself again by providing professional-grade video. The flagship model now supports ProRes RAW, a video codec that better preserves data for high-quality footage, the Log 2 format for wider color gamuts, and genlock. Genlock is software that synchronizes "video across multiple cameras." For content creators, tools like these allow the iPhone 17 Pro Max to double as a capable filmmaking camera.
