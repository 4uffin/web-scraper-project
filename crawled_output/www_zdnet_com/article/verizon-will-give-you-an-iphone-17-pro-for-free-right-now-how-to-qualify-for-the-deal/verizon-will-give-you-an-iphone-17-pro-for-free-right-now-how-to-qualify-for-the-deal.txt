Jason Hiner/ZDNETUp to $1,100 off the iPhone 17 series ZD recommends
4/5 Editor's deal rating View at Verizon Earlier this month, Apple revealed the iPhone 17, iPhone Air, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max -- and if you're interested in upgrading, Verizon has a deal for you. New and existing customers can get up to $1,100 off any of the new phones (the equivalent of a free iPhone 17 Pro) with an eligible trade-in and unlimited plan. The phones are available to preorder now, and will hit shelves Sept. 19. The iPhone 17 line includes an upgraded A19 chip, a 120Hz ProMotion display, and an enhanced front-facing camera for flexible recording. The iPhone Air is a brand-new model and Apple's slimmest, lightest iPhone yet. Also: The best iPhone 17 cases
ZD recommends
Up to $1,100 off the iPhone 17 series
View at Verizon The fine print: The trade-in phone must be active on an account for 60 days prior to the new device purchase, and must be from Apple, Google, Motorola, or Samsung (in any condition). The phone must come with a new or upgraded line on the Verizon Unlimited Ultimate plan, which is a minimum of $90 a month plus taxes and fees, with Auto Pay enabled, for 36 months. The $1,100 trade-in credit will be applied over 36 months, and will end if the eligibility requirements are no longer met. Also: The best iPhone 17 accessories you should buy if you're planning to upgradeVerizon is also offering several other deals on new Apple products. If you buy any new iPhone 17 on any myPlan, and you'll get an Apple Watch SE 3 or an Apple Watch Series 11 included free, or $500 off an Apple Watch Ultra 3. You'll have to sign up for a service plan for whichever watch you choose, though. Or, when you buy a new iPhone, you can get an iPad 16 and an Apple Watch Series 11 for free, again with a new tablet and smartwatch service plan required. If you have a smartwatch to trade in, you could get up to $400 off a new Apple Watch on the Unlimited Plus for Apple Watches plan. And finally, if you buy three or more accessories, you can save 20% on cases, screen protectors, and chargers.If you're looking to upgrade to the iPhone 17 or iPhone Air, don't miss this Verizon offer.How I rated this deal I gave this Verizon iPhone 17 deal a 4/5 editor's rating -- it's a solid trade-in deal, though you do still have to have an eligible device and sign up for a line. But if you're looking to upgrade to the new phones and want to be on Verizon, this is a great way to do it.
When will this deal expire?
Verizon's website doesn't specify an end date to this deal. We're guessing it will run at least the week of preorders, and likely longer. Deals are subject to sell out or expire anytime, though ZDNET remains committed to finding, sharing, and updating the best product deals for you to score the best savings. Our team of experts regularly checks in on the deals we share to ensure they are still live and obtainable. We're sorry if you've missed out on this deal, but don't fret -- we're constantly finding new chances to save and sharing them with you at ZDNET.com.
