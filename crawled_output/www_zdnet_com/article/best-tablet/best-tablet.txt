View now at AmazonView now at Apple Why we like it: Apple's tried-and-true tablet, the base model iPad, is arguably the best value in the company's tablet lineup thanks to its versatility and compatibility. Plus, Apple updated this tablet earlier this year to include double the base storage as last year's model, more random-access memory (RAM), and an upgraded processor in the A16 Bionic chip.When it comes to features, you essentially get the same suite as the more expensive iPad Pro and iPad Air models, but in a lighter form factor and an 11-inch Liquid Retina True Tone display.   Review: iPad 2025 (11th-Gen)Who it's for: During hands-on testing, ZDNET writer Maria Diaz said that while many of the features are the same in this generation as the previous model, day-to-day performance is notably better. "From the standard Geekbench 6 testing, the new iPad is a clear leader among previous base models," she wrote, adding, "The higher scores mean you can expect less lag, faster multitasking, and a high-end gaming performance from the latest iPad compared to an older base model. This was evident in my testing, as the 11th-Gen iPad performed flawlessly during photo editing and gaming."The base iPad model has always been a tablet for casual users, students, and kids, which makes it the best tablet for most buyers. Who should look elsewhere: The base-model iPad doesn't have Apple Intelligence capabilities or support for the newer Apple Pencil Pro, so if you're more of a power user and intend to use heavier apps like Final Cut Pro, for example, the iPad Pro or iPad Air would be better picks. Apple iPad specs: Display: 11-inch Liquid Retina display with True Tone | Processor: A16 Bionic chip | Storage: 128GB, 256GB, or 512GB | Biometrics: Touch ID | Colors: Silver, Pink, Blue, Yellow  | Cameras: 12MP f/1.8 wide, 12MP Landscape f/2.4 front | Weight: 1.05 pounds | Dimensions: 9.79 x 7.07 x .28 inches | Connections: USB-C, Smart Connector | Battery life: Up to 10 hours of video playback with USB-C charging
Pros
Better storage options
Same price as previous generation's model
A16 processor is snappy
Cons
Only current iPad without Apple Intelligence

View now at OnePlus Why we like it: The new OnePlus Pad 3 is a ZDNET Editor's Choice pick, and for good reason. The new model provides a smooth user experience thanks to the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, which can handle more demanding AI tasks. This experience is further improved by its large 13.2-inch display, which ramps up to 144Hz. Overall, this $699 tablet competes well with tablets on this list that cost hundreds more. Plus, you don't have to pay extra for accessories: when you buy the OnePlus Pad 3, you get to choose two of three available accessories for free between the smart keyboard, the folio case, and the Stylo 2. Review: OnePlus Pad 3Who it's for: Those looking for a flagship tablet that won't break the bank will love the OnePlus Pad 3. ZDNET reviews editor Kerry Wan said that in his testing, the performance was reliably fast, adding, "The tablet never showed frustrations with loading graphics, responding to inputs, and keeping services running in the background. I gracefully danced between on-screen gestures, keyboard shortcuts, and trackpad swipes, much like how I remembered doing with the $1,099 iPad Pro last year."Who should look elsewhere: There are no real drawbacks to this tablet, except perhaps its large size. If you want something smaller, you can opt for the OnePlus Pad 2, which has a 12.1-inch screen, or the Google Pixel Tablet, and its 11-inch screen.OnePlus Pad 3 specs: Display: 13.2-inch LCD display | Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite | Storage: 256GB | Memory: 12GB | Colors: Storm Blue | Cameras: 13MP rear, 8MP front camera | Weight: 1.5 pounds | Dimensions: ‎11.40 x 8.25 x 0.24 inches | Connections: USB-C | Battery: 12,140mAh
Pros
Battery and display upgrades
Updated Qualcomm chipset can handle demanding tasks
Exceptional tablet for its price range
Cons
OLED panel has a noticeable lack of contrast

View now at Best Buy Why we like it: Microsoft's 11th-generation Surface Pro earns the top spot as the best Windows tablet. The tech giant introduced several upgrades to this model, the most notable being Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Plus or X Elite chipset. The hardware delivers solid performance, allowing the device to handle multiple apps and tasks without noticeable slowdowns.Review: Microsoft Surface ProAdditionally, the Surface Pro features a PixelSense OLED touchscreen that delivers high-resolution images. Advanced color-enhancing software, such as adaptive contrast, further enhances the quality. Who it's for: ZDNET writer Cesar Cadenas said that this Surface Pro is for professional artists who want a high-performance machine with a brilliant display. "The Surface Pro houses Qualcomm's new Snapdragon X Elite, which, if the hype is to be believed, makes this laptop a 'MacBook killer,'" he wrote in his review. "Browsers ran smoothly, even with multiple videos playing and a lot of open tabs. First-party software and some third-party apps also did pretty well."The additional accessories like the keyboard and pen make it even more enticing of a tablet that can double as a computer. Cadenas particularly called out the Surface Slim Pen and its accuracy and precision in both writing and illustration. Who should look elsewhere: This tablet is expensive, starting at a minimum of $1,000, and that doesn't include the pen and keyboard, which make it perform its best. Those looking to spend less money would be better off with a different pick, such as the OnePlus Pad 2. Microsoft Surface Go 3 tech specs: Display: 13-inch OLED PixelSense Display | Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon X Plus or X Elite | Storage: Up to 1TB | Memory: 16GB, 32GB, or 64GB | Biometrics: Windows Hello face sign-in | Colors: Platinum, dune, black, or sapphire | Cameras: Quad HD front-facing Surface Studio Camera, 1440p Quad HD rear camera with ultrawide field of view | Weight: 1.97 pounds | Dimensions: 11.3 x 8.2 x 0.37 inches | Connections: Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, USB-C | Battery life: 14 hours

*Tablets were tested with maximum volume for audio and video, in addition to maximum brightnessWhy choose a tablet over a phone or laptop?
Tablets sit in the middle of smartphones and laptops. They are a compromisable device that allows for a bigger screen than a smartphone for tasks like editing PDFs, streaming movies, or browsing websites, but smaller and more portable than a laptop for note-taking, sketching and drawing, or photo editing. Plus, now many tablets have accessories like styli and keyboards that allow you to use it as a sort of laptop replacement if you're doing relatively easy work on it.

Which is the right tablet for you?
The biggest question you'll need to answer about any tablet purchase is what you plan on using it for: Do you just want something to read a comic book and binge on some Netflix shows while you walk on the treadmill? If so, then a Fire tablet or the base model iPad is going to be more than enough for you.
However, if you want to use a tablet more like a laptop, then you'll want to consider the iPad Pro, or one of the Surface devices. Here is a decision matrix that can help you choose which tablet is right for you:
Choose this tablet...If you want or are...Apple iPad (11th-gen) 				 				The best overall option when it comes to power, storage, and
user-friendliness. The Apple iPad is the best tablet for anything. 				 				Amazon Fire Max 11An affordable tablet with basic features great for streaming. If
you're looking to spend less on a tablet, this is a great pick.  				 				Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra 				 				An Android tablet with AI features and capabilities. This is
Samsung's best tablet--and largest--tablet, by far.  				 				OnePlus Pad 3The best Android tablet for entertainment and daily tasks like
checking your email and browsing the web. 				 				Microsoft Surface Pro 11A powerful Windows tablet for travel and mobile work. It has a long-lasting battery life and has AI capabilities. Apple iPad Pro (7th-gen) 				 				A tablet to replace your laptop thanks to its powerful Apple M4 chip. All you need to add is an attachable keyboard, and you have a device as
powerful as the MacBook Pro. 				 				Google Pixel Tablet 				 				Google's Pixel Tablet is one of the best Android tablets on the market. It's fast, reliable and comes with a Charging Speaker Dock that completely changes how you use it.  				 				Apple iPad Air (7th-gen) 				 				A lightweight tablet for those who want something for work and play, without big sacrifices in performance or features.Amazon Kindle Scribe 				 				A part e-reader, part tablet with an outstanding battery life and an included pen.

Factors to consider when choosing the best tablet
These were the factors that were most important to us when making our top picks: Feature sets: Not all tablets are created equal. Some are better for kids, others are simply for artists, and then there's the mini laptop for working professionals and students. We considered a variety of use cases to match virtually every need. Price points: Tablets are an expensive piece of tech, especially if you're planning on investing in compatible accessories or buying for your kids to inevitably drop at a moment's notice.Integrations with other products: We considered options that can work with a smart case, attachable keyboard, Apple Pencil, or Stylus, as well as other work and entertainment add-ons. Battery life: Whether you're using your tablet for work, play, or both, you'll want it to last the duration of your task.

Kerry Wan/ZDNETHow we test tablets
The ZDNET team chose all of the tablets included in this list based on their performance when tested in the real world. When we test tablets, we typically follow the same routine for each one to see which performs best.Display: We measure the brightness level in different lighting conditions and assess color accuracy. We also compare the display's performance with what the manufacturer promised, test the screen's responsiveness to touch, and assess the performance of any extra features, like a manufacturer's stylus.Performance: For real-world performance metrics, our reviewers measure how quickly the tablet reacts to input, assess game performance and frame rates, test how the tablet handles having multiple apps running simultaneously, measure the time it takes to launch apps, and even assess the tablet's temperature during intensive tasks. Battery life: We test different scenarios for battery life, including measuring how long the battery lasts while streaming, web browsing, using productivity apps, and playing games.Camera and audio: For cameras, we evaluate features like resolution, aperture, low-light performance, autofocus accuracy, dynamic range, color accuracy, image quality, sharpness, and video quality. For audio, we look at the sound quality and overall listening experience, including audio clarity at different volumes, stereo separation of left and right audio channels, maximum volume level in various environments, and if there is perceived distortion.For a deeper look into our testing process, check out our comprehensive tablet testing methodology.

What are the different tablet sizes?
Tablets range in size from small to large. Small tablets are usually five to seven inches. Mid-size tablets have a screen ranging from nine to 11 inches. Then, there are large tablets with screen sizes from 12-14 inches. Keep in mind that the larger the tablet, the heavier it will usually be.

What does it mean if a tablet is Wi-Fi only?
When a tablet says it is "Wi-Fi Only," it requires a wireless internet connection to access things like email, websites, and apps.
