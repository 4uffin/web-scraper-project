This demand has also been a catalyst for large-scale investments in AI infrastructure to support those goals, and a new Gartner forecast shows that momentum isn't slowing down anytime soon. The research firm published its latest AI spending forecast, which projects that in 2025, the market will reach $1.5 trillion, and by 2026, it will top $2 trillion. This is slightly more than double spending in 2024. Much of this spending is also defined by the continuous expansion of AI into products, with GenAI smartphones being the biggest project spending category in 2026, over AI services. Also: Gartner says add AI agents ASAP - or else. Oh, and they're also overhyped"The forecast assumes continued investment in AI infrastructure expansion, as major hyperscalers continue to increase investments in data centers with AI-optimized hardware and GPUs to scale their services," said John-David Lovelock, distinguished VP analyst at Gartner. The company created a table detailing the breakdown of the AI Spending in IT Markets forecast, which you can see below. Market202420252026AI Services259,477282,556324,669AI Application Software83,679172,029269,703AI Infrastructure Software56,904126,177229,825GenAI Models5,71914,20025,766AI-optimized Servers (GPU and Non-GPU AI Accelerators)140,107267,534329,528AI-optimized IaaS7,44718,32537,507AI Processing Semiconductors138,813209,192267,934AI PCs by ARM and x8651,02390,432144,413GenAI Smartphones244,735298,189393,297Total AI Spending987,9041,478,6342,022,642Credit: GartnerA metric that stood out to me was the growth in demand for AI services, AI application software, and GenAI models. As ZDNET has previously reported, many businesses adopting AI applications or services are not seeing a clear return on investment. I figured this would discourage further investment, but it seems that the promise will be enough to keep these investments going. Want to follow my work? Add ZDNET as a trusted source on Google.Artificial Intelligence
