View now at HubSpot HubSpot is an excellent option for small businesses and projects because you can start learning for free and scale up as you require. Why we like it: HubSpot is a great way to learn how CRM software can benefit your business. You can take advantage of the HubSpot free plan, which requires only an email address sign-up and a short verification process. While testing out this CRM, I found the walk-through and guides to different parts of the platform very useful. If you're unsure how to use a CRM platform, HubSpot will point you in the right direction, and its tutorials will help you learn about each section without too much stress. You can use HubSpot for a variety of tasks, such as organizing and managing marketing, customer contact records, website development, and customer support, among many other use cases.  Paid plans begin at $15 per seat per month for starter plans, which I consider affordable and a good value for the money. However, subscriptions to advanced plans quickly escalate in price. Recently, HubSpot

However, some also note that the costs can quickly escalate if you want advanced features.Who should look elsewhere: Though you'll find that the basic, free CRM can be used for tasks such as contact management and email marketing, some things are limited to paid plans, including features like automation, sales lead generation, and helpdesk functions, as well as some reporting options. So, if you later feel like you need these options, you'll either need to upgrade or look elsewhere.HubSpot features: Different workspaces | Website help | Dashboards | Contact sync | Tutorials | App marketplace | Free plan, 14-day trial
Pros
Clean user interface
Useful guides
Free plan
Affordable starter plan at $15 per seat, monthly
Cons
Costs can quickly escalate for bolt-ons
Reports of poor customer service

How did I choose these CRM software providers?
When I selected our top recommendations for the best CRM software providers of 2025, I considered the following factors:Scalability: Today's CRM platforms must be able to scale up to meet the changing demands and needs of their clients. Each of the top recommendations listed offers scalable plans and subscriptions. Customization: Many organizations today want to be able to customize their CRM platforms, depending on their industry and use cases. It's important that our top recommendations offer a range of customization features. Features: Businesses expect a wide portfolio of features in their CRM suites. These may include automation, deal and sales management, support channel setups, AI, predictive analytics, and team collaboration tools. Automation: CRM software providers must offer automation tools to appeal to small and medium-sized businesses and the enterprise. Automation offerings I like to see include workflow management and support functions. Support: It's important that CRM providers have a range of channels that business customers can use for support, no matter their size. I've included solutions that provide customer support over email, chat, live help, and the phone.Customer experiences: I've extensively researched the feedback and experiences of new and long-term customers of each of the CRM software providers I've recommended, and I keep an eye on any changes. Cost: CRM software can be a valuable tool for growth, analytics, and managing customer and client relationships, but it must also offer a good return on investment. With this in mind, I've included a range of solutions suitable for different budgets.

What are the major types of CRM software?
Though the overall classifications of different types of CRM software vary from vendor to vendor, the same themes appear. You may want to research the major types of CRM before you make a purchase decision, as that may influence how your business grows. Operational: Most modern CRM platforms offer some kind of operational mechanism or module. Operational CRMs tend to focus on optimizing business operations, including sales processes, logistics, and customer communications. Operational CRMs may be particularly useful for startups and small and midsize businesses looking to scale. Analytical/data-driven: Other CRMs focus on the intrinsic value of data. Businesses able to handle, securely store, and analyze customer data -- always useful if held in a centralized, organized platform -- can draw insights and see patterns that may influence their future sales activities or reveal new revenue streams. Furthermore, data-driven CRMs may reveal ways to improve customer relationships and retention. Collaborative: Collaborative CRMs provide organizations with a way to enhance collaboration and productivity. CRM suites can be used to create department channels and data repositories, allowing different teams to work together and to share information. For instance, a sales team could collaborate with marketing and finance to create new customer promotions and campaigns. Customer service teams, too, can access important records to track customer journeys and resolve issues.

How to integrate CRM software into your business efficiently
Every business has unique CRM requirements, and the solution you select will depend on the needs of your organization. Below are some basic recommendations for integrating your new CRM software effectively:Plan and assess: Research and assess the needs of your business and whether the CRM solution you're considering will provide a return on your investment. Consider the type of CRM you need, your primary reason for using a CRM, how many seats you'll need, and whether you need collaborative functions to integrate the CRM with different departments, such as marketing or customer service. Existing systems: Consider whether there are existing, legacy systems that the CRM will replace. If there are apps you want the CRM to integrate with, you may also need to check compatibility requirements and support. It may also be important to create new policies, especially around data and security. Integrations and downtime: There are various tactics you can use for integrating a new CRM with existing systems, apps, and data silos. Though quick-and-dirty code changes and bridges are an option, as well as standalone CRM integration software, we recommend that you also explore the use of robust APIs that won't cause interoperability issues down the line. Testing: Testing adds yet another step to integration processes, but it's imperative that comprehensive testing take place during the CRM integration timeline. Training: Set aside time and contact the CRM vendor's support team if necessary to ensure your staff is trained in how the new CRM operates. If your employees aren't aware of the collaborative benefits of a CRM, this may affect productivity. Ongoing assessments: Once your CRM is integrated into your ecosystem, ongoing assessments of its value, security, and use should take place to ensure there's a demonstrable return on investment.

Is there a free CRM?
There are a handful of free CRM solutions available such as those offered by Zoho, HubSpot, and Monday.com. These are typically suited for smaller businesses and projects, but you should expect some limits if you aren't a paid subscriber. Investing in a CRM is a significant decision. How the platform operates and how you decide to use it will influence your business' growth, future development, and potentially customer relations. As a result, if you're just starting out, it might be worth trying a free CRM solution or a free trial before you commit, especially if monthly plans aren't available. However, there are caveats. Some of the disadvantages of free CRMs include functional limits, especially regarding business operations, AI, and analytics, as well as limited data collection and analysis, basic supportm and a restricted number of seats.

Yes, Salesforce offers a CRM -- and it's one of the most popular CRM platforms out there. Salesforce provides a cloud-based SaaS, or software as a service, CRM platform with an extensive range of business and customer relationship management functions.
Show more
Is CRM a SaaS product?
CRM suites are usually provided as SaaS, or software as a service. Though you don't necessarily need to pay for a CRM, depending on the scale and needs of your business, a SaaS-based option -- which is usually a subscription model -- could be the right fit for you. This is especially important for enterprise companies that need to manage an extensive customer base and large sales network.
