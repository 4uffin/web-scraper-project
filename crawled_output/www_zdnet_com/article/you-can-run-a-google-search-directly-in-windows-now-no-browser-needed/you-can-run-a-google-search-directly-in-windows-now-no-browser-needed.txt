But if you're working in Windows, that means you have to stop what you're doing, fire up your browser, go to Google's search site, and then enter your query. Wouldn't it be quicker and easier if you could do all of that without launching your browser? Well, now you can.A new Google Labs experiment dubbed Google app for Windows can display a floating Google search bar anywhere in Windows. Just type your query in the search field, and the results appear in a scrollable window.Also: Windows 11 lets you run a network speed test right from the taskbar now - how to try itThe window works just like the regular results page. You can move from one page of results to another and narrow down the results by images, shopping, news, videos, and more. You can also jump to Google AI Mode if you want an AI-based synopsis of the results.The new app also taps into Google Lens, which means you can search any text or image on your screen just by selecting it. You're also able to copy the text or image and translate text into a different language.To try this out, head to the Google app for Windows lab page. Flip the switch to turn on the experiment and then click the Download app button to grab the installation file. Double-click the file to install the program and then sign in with your Google account when prompted.A window pops up seeking your permission to access your local files and your files in Google Drive. By default, the app will have access to both locations, but you can disable them if you don't want those files to be included in your search results.Also: I used Google Lens to identify my weirdest junk drawer items - here's how it didWherever you are and whatever you're doing in Windows, just press Alt+Spacebar to trigger the search bar. In the Ask Anything field, type your search query or question, and the results will appear in the window. To turn off the bar, just press Alt+Spacebar again.The Google for Windows app works in Windows 10 and 11 and is currently accessible only in the US. Google cautions that the app is still experimental and has some known limitations. If you want to try this out, don't delay, as Google warns that space is limited.Google Labs is where the company tests out experimental features to see if they'll catch on among users. The Google Labs site has been home to a variety of other tools that you've been able to take for a spin, including the Google Flow filmmaking program, the Music AI Sandbox, the Jules AI coding agent, Little Language Lessons, Career Dreamer, and NotebookLM.Also: I used NotebookLM for an entire month - here's why it really is a game changerMost of the current experiments are AI-oriented. That makes senses since companies like Google want to take advantage of the buzz around AI.But in some ways, AI has been a thorn in Google's side. That's because more people are turning to AI bots like ChatGPT and Copilot to ask questions and research information, an activity for which they would have always turned to Google search in the past.Google needs to make sure that its traditional search engine still remains relevant and popular in the age of AI. Bringing its search directly to Windows is a smart move for the company and one that should also prove handy and helpful to Windows users.Want to follow my work? Add ZDNET as a trusted source on Google.Featured
