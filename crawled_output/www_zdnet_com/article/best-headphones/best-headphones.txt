A good pair of headphones can be your best friend, but choosing the right pair is highly dependent on your needs. Whether you want over-ear, noise-canceling headphones or open-ear earbuds that can go with you from the office to your evening run, we've tested products from brands like Apple, Sony, Bose, and Beats to help you find the best ones.Get more in-depth ZDNET tech coverage: Add us as a preferred Google source on Chrome and Chromium browsers.What are the best headphones right now?After extensively testing all of the top headphones available today, the best everyday headphones are the Sony WH-1000XM6 for their impressive sound profile. Additionally, they overtook the Bose QuietComfort Ultra for the best noise-canceling headphones on the market. Still, the Bose QuietComfort Ultra have impressive noise-canceling, cloud-like comfort, and a sporty and casual design. Sonos' Ace headphones are better than ever, thanks to a recent software overhaul, and Google's Pixel Buds Pro 2 and Apple's AirPods Pro 2 are still the best premium options for Android and iOS users, respectively.

View now at WalmartView now at B&H Photo-VideoView now at Target Why we like them: Sony reclaimed the noise-canceling throne with the XM6, delivering the best noise cancellation on the market. The XM6 debuted with an even more practical design, more advanced software features, and support for the LC3 Bluetooth codec, which is compatible with newer Samsung and Google Pixel phones.Review: Sony WH-1000XM6Sony's signature sound profile consists of few peaks in higher frequencies and a slight emphasis on the bass, delivering an enjoyable listening experience. The XM6 also feature Sony's 360 Spatial Sound technology, the company's take on spatial audio. Previously, Sony reserved this feature for select music streaming services, but now users can enable it freely.Who these are for: The XM6 are ideal for people who value sound and noise cancellation over style. Sony's headphones are wonderfully practical for commuting, traveling, and effectively blocking external noise. If you're looking for everyday headphones that sound great, offer intuitive features, and provide the best noise cancellation, the XM6 are for you.Who should look elsewhere: The XM6 are all about practicality, favoring sound, software features, and noise cancellation over style. Although the XM6 have a nondescript and uniform design, they lack any flash accents or elevated style points. If you prefer headphones that make more of a fashion statement, consider the AirPods Max or Sonos Ace. Sony WH-1000XM6 tech specs: Form factor: Over-ear | Bluetooth: Yes (5.3) | Battery life: 40 hours (ANC off) | Driver size: 30mm dynamic | Noise cancellation: Yes | Wired option(s): 3.5mm headphone jack

View now at Amazon Why we like them: Bose's latest flagship headphones are defined by their effective noise cancellation, immense comfort, and laid-back, casual design. These headphones have 10 microphones to aid in noise cancellation and sport plushy, perforated vegan leather earpads for maximum comfort and breathability.Also: Why these Bose headphones are still my favorite - even though they're a year oldBose's Immersive Audio feature allows these headphones to encode audio from any device in spatial audio, and the companion app offers options to customize noise cancellation and audio modes. Thanks to their highly effective noise-canceling properties, customization options, and versatility, the QC Ultra make the perfect premium headphones for everyday use.Who these are for: These headphones excel for desk workers, commuters, frequently flyers, and mobile YouTube video watchers. Their foldable design makes it easy to stuff them in your bag, and their noise cancellation performance provide a buffer from airport, office, and environmental chatter. Who should look elsewhere: If you're prone to forgetting to charge your headphones throughout the week, the QC Ultra are sure to disappoint with their relatively short 24-hour battery life, which gets shorter with noise cancellation and Immersive Audio enabled. Those who value style over functionality may find the QC Ultra's design lackluster and too casual, instead of elevated and sleek. Although the QC Ultra features higher-quality build materials like a soft matte coating and aluminum yokes, they don't look as sleek as Apple's AirPods Max or Sonos' Ace. Still, if your aesthetic is sportier and more casual, the QC Ultra will suit your style.Bose recently increased the QC Ultra's retail price from $429 to $449, making them the same price as the Sony XM6. However, the QC Ultra are an older model and are often on sale for as low as $349.Bose QuietComfort Ultra tech specs: Form factor: Over-ear | Bluetooth: Yes (5.3) | Battery life: 24 hours (ANC off) | Driver size: 35mm dynamic | Noise cancellation: Yes | Wired option(s): 3.5mm headphone jack

So much so, we awarded them with a ZDNET Editors' Choice award for providing premium features to a host of Android devices and major improvements to comfort, fit, and design compared to their predecessors.Review: Google Pixel Buds Pro 2Most Android users can download the Google Pixel Buds app to access features like Gemini integration, Find My Earbuds, translation services, hearing health assistance, and adaptive noise cancellation. The Pixel Buds Pro 2's compatibility transcends device brand, allowing Google Pixel, Samsung Galaxy, Nothing Phone users, and more to use the earbuds' best qualities.Who these are for: Android users in search of premium earbuds for everyday use will find these buds most useful. They are an auditory companion to your Android smartphone, perfect for hands-free calling, scheduling events on Google Calendar, and step-by-step Google Maps directions, and versatile enough to accompany you everywhere.These earbuds provide enough noise cancellation for daily commutes, strong durability for sweaty after-work workouts, and 30 hours of total listening time to stick by you all week. If you have a Pixel phone, Chromebook, Galaxy Tab, or a tech arsenal full of Android and Chrome devices, the Pixel Buds Pro 2 are for you.Who should look elsewhere: Like AirPods, which are strictly compatible with Apple devices, the Pixel Buds Pro 2 are designed for Android users. The Pixel Buds app is the hub for accessing all of the earbuds' features, and the app is not available on iOS.

View now at AmazonView now at B&H Photo-VideoView now at Crutchfield Why we like them: The Sonos Ace provide the vibrant, dynamic sound Sonos lovers adore in a portable, stylish pair of premium consumer headphones. The Ace have a sleek design with soft matte coated ear cups, memory foam earpads, and metallic accents for an elevated look. Also: Here's how a free software upgrade made the Sonos Ace worth their price tagThese headphones feature Dolby Atmos spatial audio, noise cancellation, transparency mode, Bluetooth multipoint, and compatibility with Sonos' soundbars. TV Audio Swap allows users to privately watch TV since the Ace and Sonos soundbar share the same home Wi-Fi network. Who these are for: The Sonos Ace are a solid premium headphone option for people looking for headphones that sound great and have an ultramodern look. People who frequently watch TV shows or YouTube videos on a mobile device would appreciate the Ace's well-balanced sound that's perfect for dialogue.If you have Sonos soundbars, the TV Audio Swap feature is a game-changer. It allows you to stream compatible content in Dolby Atmos and impeccable clarity without disturbing sleeping kids, your partner, or neighbors during late-night viewing or afternoon nap time.Who should look elsewhere: If strong noise cancellation is your priority, you'll want to consider other options, like the Bose QuietComfort Ultra. The Ace are Sonos' first headphones, and the company needs to refine their noise-canceling abilities. I recommend these headphones the most to people who will frequently use the TV Audio Swap feature, as you can find headphones with better noise cancellation and more software features for less money. Sonos Ace tech specs: Form factor: Over-ear | Bluetooth: Yes (5.4) | Battery life: 30 hours (ANC on) | Driver size: 40mm dynamic | Noise cancellation: Yes | Wired option(s): USB-C

View now at AmazonView now at Best BuyView now at B&H Photo-Video Why we like them: Shokz's latest true wireless open earbuds offer an exceptional open-ear listening experience, defined by great sound, an elevated design, and a lengthy battery life. These earbuds debuted with new features like a multifunction button, four more hours of playtime than the previous generation, upgraded water resistance, and enhanced audio technology.Review: Shokz OpenFit 2These earbuds are highly comfortable, as their soft coating doesn't pressure the bony part behind your ears; it's easy to put them on and forget you're wearing them. The updated design also makes them more stylish, phasing out previous generations' highly sporty look. The OpenFit 2 have an IP55 rating, making them durable enough for sweaty workouts and runs in light rain. Also, their improved Bluetooth 5.4 connectivity ensures stable connections and efficient power consumption.Who they're for: Although the OpenFit 2 excel in active scenarios like running or hiking, their design is elevated enough to act as casual open-ear earbuds. I recommend them most to people with active lifestyles searching for a casual open-ear earbud they can take from the office to their evening jog.Who should look elsewhere: You shouldn't expect the OpenFit 2 to perform in noisy environments like a crowded gym, a busy train, or a grocery store. You'll hear too much of your surroundings and not enough of your music. If you want earbuds that can handle sweaty workouts but have noise cancellation and transparency mode options, consider the AirPods pro 2 for iOS or the Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 for Android.Shokz OpenFit 2 tech specs: Form factor: Open-ear | Bluetooth: Yes (5.4) | Battery life: 11 hours and an additional 37 hours with charging case | IP rating: IP55 (sweatproof) | Charging option(s): USB-C

View now at AmazonView now at Walmart Why we like them: The AirPods Pro 2 are Apple's most advanced earbuds, offering users advanced noise cancellation, hearing health features, integration with Siri, and compatibility with all your Apple devices. These earbuds sound great and get the job done, making them a wonderful auditory companion for iOS users on the go.Also: I've used my AirPods Pro 2 since they first launched. Here's my buying advice for 2025Who these are for: The AirPods Pro 2 are best suited for Apple users, especially those with iPhones. They're great earbuds for iOS users who want a small, pocketable pair of earbuds to take while traveling, commuting, and living everyday life. If you want the latest and greatest AirPods, you may want to wait for the AirPods Pro 3 since these earbuds are due for a refresh within the next year. However, the AirPods Pro 2 have plenty of useful features, and you can often find them as low as $189 during seasonal sales.Who should look elsewhere: Like all of Apple's headphones, the Pro 2 are not suitable for Android users. If you pair these earbuds with a non-Apple device, you'll miss out on key features like spatial audio, adaptive noise cancellation, conversation awareness, and a hearing aid feature, all of which are reserved for iOS. So, if you're an Android user and want premium earbuds, consider the Pixel Buds Pro 2 instead.AirPods Pro 2 tech specs: Form factor: In-ear | Bluetooth: Yes (5.3) | Battery life: 6 hours and an additional 30 hours with charging case | IP rating: IP54 (sweatproof) | Driver size: 11mm dynamic | Noise cancellation: Yes | Charging option(s): USB-C, wireless

Here's my buying advice for 2025Who these are for: The AirPods Pro 2 are best suited for Apple users, especially those with iPhones. They're great earbuds for iOS users who want a small, pocketable pair of earbuds to take while traveling, commuting, and living everyday life. If you want the latest and greatest AirPods, you may want to wait for the AirPods Pro 3 since these earbuds are due for a refresh within the next year. However, the AirPods Pro 2 have plenty of useful features, and you can often find them as low as $189 during seasonal sales.Who should look elsewhere: Like all of Apple's headphones, the Pro 2 are not suitable for Android users. If you pair these earbuds with a non-Apple device, you'll miss out on key features like spatial audio, adaptive noise cancellation, conversation awareness, and a hearing aid feature, all of which are reserved for iOS. So, if you're an Android user and want premium earbuds, consider the Pixel Buds Pro 2 instead.AirPods Pro 2 tech specs: Form factor: In-ear | Bluetooth: Yes (5.3) | Battery life: 6 hours and an additional 30 hours with charging case | IP rating: IP54 (sweatproof) | Driver size: 11mm dynamic | Noise cancellation: Yes | Charging option(s): USB-C, wireless

Factors to consider when choosing a pair of headphones
There's no perfect pair of headphones that receives 10s all-around. Some are better at noise cancellation, while others sound better or have more stylistic flair. The headphones your best friend loves and recommends you try might be the worst headphones you've ever worn, which is why it's essential to consider these factors before you buy:Battery life: Nothing is worse than throwing on your headphones and seeing they're on 5% battery. If you often forget to charge your headphones, you'll want a pair with an extensive battery life. So, the Bose QuietComfort Ultra might not be your best option, but the JBL Live 770NC could work better for you.Use cases: There are many types of headphones, so you must ensure you're buying the right kind that matches your specific use cases. Perhaps your friend recommended the Sonos Ace headphones for their great sound, but you expected stronger noise-canceling -- a feature you anticipated, especially for the amount of money you spent. If you want headphones for commuting, make sure the headphones you're eyeing are suitable for that. If you prefer to wear headphones in more active scenarios, consider earbuds instead of over-ear headphones.Lifestyle headphones vs. audio-focused headphones: Headphones fall into two categories. Lifestyle (consumer) headphones are the headphones you see from brands like Bose, Apple, and Sony. However, brands like Sony and Sennheiser manufacture both lifestyle and audio-focused headphones. Lifestyle headphones can accompany you on your daily commute, to the office, and to the gym -- all on the same day. On the other hand, audio-focused headphones, like the Focal Azurys, may lack the comfort, noise-canceling tech, and portability that lifestyle headphones possess since their primary use case is to examine audio critically.Operating system: Some headphones and earbuds are meant to work best with devices within that manufacturer's device ecosystem. Apple's AirPods Pro 2, Samsung's Galaxy Buds 3 Pro, and Google's Pixel Buds Pro 2 are examples. If you have mostly Apple devices, AirPods may be your best option. If you have a mixed-device ecosystem, consider headphones from Bose, Sony, or JBL.

How we test headphones
The ZDNET team spends weeks with a pair of headphones to give you an informed opinion before you make a purchase. Here are the benchmarks we use to test headphones.Comfort and design: We wear headphones for hours at a time to determine how long we can wear them before they become uncomfortable. We also test headphones across all budgets, meaning we test headphones made from inexpensive and more expensive materials to test durability.Noise cancellation: We wear noise-canceling headphones in various environments to test how well the technology performs in quieter and louder settings.Sound quality: Sound quality and sound profiles are highly subjective, as some people prefer heavier bass, while others prefer more pronounced treble. To give you the best idea about a pair of headphones' sound profile, we listen to them with different audio modes enabled. We also listen to headphones on various devices, like iPhones, Macs, Windows computers, tablets, and TVs, to listen for sound distinctions.Battery life: In rare cases, battery life deviates from a manufacturer's claim, and battery life varies depending on how you use a pair of headphones. To ensure a pair of headphones offers as much battery as advertised, we integrate the review unit into our daily lives by listening to music, taking calls, and enabling features like spatial audio.Use cases: No pair of headphones is a one-size-fits-all affair. Usually, headphones have a specific use case, whether for critical listening, watching TV, exercising, or canceling environmental noises. To determine which group of consumers will benefit the most from a pair of headphones, we test headphones in various use cases to specify their purpose.

How do I choose the right headphones?
Before you buy a pair of headphones, you should consider a few things besides price. A pair of headphones' form factor, connectivity, and features are equally important. Here are some other things to consider before making a purchase.Earbuds or headphones? Earbuds are smaller, more portable, and often protected against sweat and exposure to rain, but they have a shorter battery life. Headphones are larger and sometimes less portable but typically offer more immersive audio and noise-canceling experiences.Wired or wireless (Bluetooth)?: I recommend wired headphones for people who want to occasionally listen to music critically. Over a wired connection, you can access high-resolution music playback. If that doesn't matter to you and you'd rather have portable and wire-free headphones, you want wireless headphones. Fortunately, many consumer headphones can be wired or wireless, and many wireless headphones in this list can achieve high-resolution audio playback via a wired connection.

Are the Sony XM6 better than the Sony XM5?
The Sony XM5 and XM6 are both great headphones. Both provide listeners with expertly tuned sound, impressive noise cancellation, and an unassuming design fit for the everyday person. However, the XM6 excel in noise cancellation, and they sport a foldable design, making them more portable.Now that the XM6 have arrived, you can find the XM5 at lower prices, making them a better option for budget-focused buyers.

Sony or Bose: Which brand is best for you?
Both Sony and Bose make some of the best consumer headphones on the market. Both companies champion years of innovation and research, but each company's headphones' strengths shine in different categories. Sony is better for producing reliable headphones with a nondescript design, while Bose's headphones are more comfortable and integrate with the company's other consumer audio products.You should choose Sony's XM6 headphones if you want reliable, everyday headphones with a premium and durable build, rich sound, effective noise cancellation, and a lengthy battery life. Sony's flagship headphones promise 40 hours of listening time, 16 more than the QC Ultra.You should choose the Bose QC Ultra headphones if you want more comfortable headphones with a more intense focus on design elements. Bose's premium headphones are often rereleased in seasonal colors and feature metal accents and stylish branding.

Should I buy on-ear or over-ear headphones?
I prefer over-ear headphones over on-ear headphones. On-ear headphones, like the Beats Solo 4, sit on your ears, while over-ear headphones, like the AirPods Max, cover your entire ear. Over-ear headphones create a better seal between your ears and the outside world, allowing for increased noise-canceling performance and a more immersive audio experience.However, you may like on-ear headphones if you want headphones with a more compact shape. If you don't like noise-canceling or prefer to hear your surroundings better, you should consider on-ear headphones.

How long do headphones last?
A solid pair of headphones should last you five years, if not more. You can get great mileage on your headphones by taking care of them. To make the most of yours, here are some tips I use myself:Avoid exposing your over-ear headphones to excessive moisture or rain; do not submerge them in water. I don't recommend working out in over-ear headphones because sweat can degrade the ear pad materials. However, if you work out in your over-ear headphones, wipe the ear pads with a cloth after your workout to remove sweat. Or, you can purchase sweat covers for your ear pads. Earbuds and bone conduction headphones are better equipped for exposure to sweat and rain.Store your headphones in their case when not in use for long periods. Most headphones come with a protective hardshell carrying case or pouch. The case protects your headphones from dust, moisture, scratches, or scrapes.Never spray your headphones or earbuds with chemicals or solvents.Regularly check your headphones' companion app for software updates. Many headphones receive about five years of software updates, and keeping your headphones updated ensures optimal performance.

FAQs on headphonesHeadphones FAQs
How do I choose the right headphones?
Before you buy a pair of headphones, you should consider a few things besides price. A pair of headphones' form factor, connectivity, and features are equally important. Here are some other things to consider before making a purchase.Earbuds or headphones? Earbuds are smaller, more portable, and often protected against sweat and exposure to rain, but they have a shorter battery life. Headphones are larger and sometimes less portable but typically offer more immersive audio and noise-canceling experiences.Wired or wireless (Bluetooth)?: I recommend wired headphones for people who want to occasionally listen to music critically. Over a wired connection, you can access high-resolution music playback. If that doesn't matter to you and you'd rather have portable and wire-free headphones, you want wireless headphones. Fortunately, many consumer headphones can be wired or wireless, and many wireless headphones in this list can achieve high-resolution audio playback via a wired connection.

Sony or Bose: Which brand is best for you?
Both Sony and Bose make some of the best consumer headphones on the market. Both companies champion years of innovation and research, but each company's headphones' strengths shine in different categories. Sony is better for producing reliable headphones with a nondescript design, while Bose's headphones are more comfortable and integrate with the company's other consumer audio products.You should choose Sony's XM6 headphones if you want reliable, everyday headphones with a premium and durable build, rich sound, effective noise cancellation, and a lengthy battery life. Sony's flagship headphones promise 40 hours of listening time, 16 more than the QC Ultra.You should choose the Bose QC Ultra headphones if you want more comfortable headphones with a more intense focus on design elements. Bose's premium headphones are often rereleased in seasonal colors and feature metal accents and stylish branding.

Should I buy on-ear or over-ear headphones?
I prefer over-ear headphones over on-ear headphones. On-ear headphones, like the Beats Solo 4, sit on your ears, while over-ear headphones, like the AirPods Max, cover your entire ear. Over-ear headphones create a better seal between your ears and the outside world, allowing for increased noise-canceling performance and a more immersive audio experience.However, you may like on-ear headphones if you want headphones with a more compact shape. If you don't like noise-canceling or prefer to hear your surroundings better, you should consider on-ear headphones.
