View now at Hostinger I consider Hostinger's premium plan an excellent option for most website owners and small businesses. Why we like it: Hostinger's premium plan costs $3 per month with three months free. This is excellent value for money if you want to operate multiple websites under one account. Business options begin at $4 per month.The premium plan supports up to 100 websites. It offers 100GB of storage, up to 100 email addresses and forwarders, free Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) website security, templates, unlimited bandwidth, and a free domain name. If you need a theme, Hostinger also provides a drag-and-drop website builder, AI tools, and web design templates. Furthermore, Google Analytics integration, search engine optimization (SEO) tools, and standard distributed denial of service (DDoS) protection are included. You'll also be given basic e-commerce capabilities and one-click WordPress installation and migration. The same WordPress installation can support multiple WordPress websites. Who it's for: I signed up with Hostinger last year to operate a website to provide email, and so far, I have been impressed with the service. Review: HostingerAside from a few cases of maintenance-related downtime, uptime has been spot-on, and I've had no problems with reliability, storage, or loading speed. As a result, Hostinger will suit many smaller operators who simply need an affordable and reliable web host.Who should look elsewhere: A downside is that you can only access more advanced features, such as daily backups and increased performance, with more expensive subscriptions. There's no dedicated Internet Protocol (IP) address outside of cloud and virtual private server (VPS) hosting, for example. While this won't bother most website owners, if you need more advanced hosting solutions, you will want to look at my other recommendations.In addition, while many customers applaud Hostinger's customer service, some clients operating multiple websites have reported bounce-backs and slow load times. Hostinger features: cPanel: Yes | SSL: Some plans | SSH: Yes | Backups: Yes | E-commerce: Basic+ | Money-back guarantee: 30 days | Support: 24/7 live chat support | Starting price: $3 per month | Trustpilot: 4.7/5

View now at Hosting.com Hosting.com, previously known as A2 Hosting, is an excellent web hosting option for beginners who want to learn the ropes without spending a fortune.Why we like it: Hosting.com provides a 24/7 customer team if you need help deciding on a plan or for any installation issues afterward. For just under $2 per month, Hosting.com's basic shared hosting Starter package includes one website, five email accounts, 15GB of storage, an SSL certificate, and a website builder.At the time of writing, for the same price, you can upgrade to Plus, which provides support for two websites, 30GB of storage, and 10 email accounts.You can upgrade as your project grows. Pro and Max options start at $7 and $9 per month, respectively. These tiers include support for up to 100 websites, up to 100GB storage, and automatic backups with more computing resources. Pricing increases after your first year.Who it's for: Beginners who want a cheap, simple plan without being overwhelmed by different features and options. Customers applaud the firm's 24/7 phone, email, and chat support, with assistance available during migration and beyond. Who should look elsewhere: Anyone looking for a web host for large projects. I don't think they are the best value for money at their normal prices due to email restrictions. You can only have up to 40 email accounts; a restriction I don't think should be in premium hosting plans. Hosting.com features: cPanel: Yes | SSL: Yes | SSH: Yes | Backups: Daily | E-commerce: Yes | Money-back guarantee: 30 days | Support: 24/7 phone, email, live chat support | Starting price: $2 per month | Trustpilot: 4.6/5

On a one-year plan, you will only pay $1 per month, and you can operate unlimited websites with unlimited databases and storage. Also: Best CRM software for small businessesThis plan includes one-click installations of around 70 apps, including WordPress and Drupal, and you will also receive a wildcard SSL certificate. Alternatively, you could opt for the basic "Essential" plans supporting one website with ten databases, alongside 10GB of storage space, which will cost you $4 per month on an annual plan. A free domain name for one year and email are included. Furthermore, it's worth taking a look at the Ionos virtual private server (VPS) hosting service if you want dedicated resources.Who should look elsewhere: A potential price hike may occur after the one-year promotional period ends for Ionos Plus, which typically costs $12 per month.

View now at GreenGeeks GreenGeeks is a great web hosting option if you want to sign up for a sustainable, eco-conscious hosting service to support your small business.Why we like it: GreenGeeks has developed its marketing around the concept of being environmentally friendly, with three times the power your hosting demands replaced with wind power credits and tree planting. It's not just the environmental factor, GreenGeeks also prides itself on providing speedy and reliable service. Although the company's website could use a modern overhaul, the important part is the hosting, which includes standard hosting, WordPress installs, e-commerce, virtual private server (VPS), and dedicated tiers. Who it's for: The environmentally conscious and anyone who wants ongoing, excellent support. GreenGeeks' customer service is top-notch, according to customer feedback. Basic plans cost $3 per month, with options to upgrade and expand over time. The basic web hosting plan only covers one website with 25GB of storage. Once you move up a level or two, you can expect support for unlimited websites, managed WordPress installations, 50GB or 100GB of storage, and a free SSL certificate.Who should look elsewhere: It's an excellent option for starter projects and small businesses. I don't think the range of services and features will suit mid-size companies, larger e-commerce stores, or beyond.  GreenGeeks features: cPanel: Yes | SSL: Free | SSH: Yes | Backups: Varies by plan | E-commerce: Yes, WooCommerce | Money-back guarantee: 30 days | Support: Depends on the plan | Starting price: $3 per month | Trustpilot: 4.6/5

View now at GoDaddy GoDaddy has offered as wide an array of services as possible for individuals and small businesses needing an internet presence. Why we like it: It's widely known as a brand and many customers enjoy the service. GoDaddy is a great option if you prefer to stick with a well-known web hosting provider, or you're looking to open an e-commerce store. It's also recently introduced AI-based services to help you find the right domain name and to assist you with branding. The comprehensive domain name search functions are also useful.For new customers, pricing begins at $5 per month for one website. Specific plans may qualify you for a free domain name and SSL certificate. If you want to purchase multiple domains, they're pretty cheap. GoDaddy can be configured to apply WordPress updates automatically and offers malware-scanning services. Each plan comes with a one-click WordPress installation, a cPanel, and daily backups. Review: GoDaddyLaunching an online store won't take you long. E-commerce plans, including secure SSL to protect customer data and inbuilt SEO tools, start at $10 per month. A free trial for this service is available.Who it's for: If you already have a domain name purchased through GoDaddy, adding on a hosting package will be convenient. It's also a great option for hosting e-commerce stores. Customer service is considered reasonable by many. If you need a technical lead to get something accomplished, customers say you can usually find assistance. ZDNET author David Gewirtz has decades of experience with GoDaddy and respects how this web host provides the key services most customers want.

GoDaddy Best web hosting service for GoDaddy domain customers, e-commerce
3.9
/ 5
Score
GoDaddy has offered as wide an array of services as possible for individuals and small businesses needing an internet presence. Why we like it: It's widely known as a brand and many customers enjoy the service. GoDaddy is a great option if you prefer to stick with a well-known web hosting provider, or you're looking to open an e-commerce store. It's also recently introduced AI-based services to help you find the right domain name and to assist you with branding. The comprehensive domain name search functions are also useful.For new customers, pricing begins at $5 per month for one website. Specific plans may qualify you for a free domain name and SSL certificate. If you want to purchase multiple domains, they're pretty cheap. GoDaddy can be configured to apply WordPress updates automatically and offers malware-scanning services. Each plan comes with a one-click WordPress installation, a cPanel, and daily backups. Review: GoDaddyLaunching an online store won't take you long. E-commerce plans, including secure SSL to protect customer data and inbuilt SEO tools, start at $10 per month. A free trial for this service is available.Who it's for: If you already have a domain name purchased through GoDaddy, adding on a hosting package will be convenient. It's also a great option for hosting e-commerce stores. Customer service is considered reasonable by many. If you need a technical lead to get something accomplished, customers say you can usually find assistance. ZDNET author David Gewirtz has decades of experience with GoDaddy and respects how this web host provides the key services most customers want. They're not the best, but they do a good job with almost everything. Who should look elsewhere: Beginners might find the range of services overwhelming, so they may want to look at Hosting.com or Ionos instead. Unfortunately, the refund policy is restrictive, and the host's website is cluttered, making it difficult to find exactly what service you need -- and at what price.It should also be noted that GoDaddy has recently come under fire over its security practices.

Factors to consider when choosing a web hosting service
When selecting your new web hosting provider in 2025, consider these crucial factors:Reliability: I recommend you choose a web hosting provider with a long history of stable, reliable service. After all, your website could end up being the central hub of your business for promotion and customer communication, so constant downtime can harm your reputation.Affordability: Your budget must be based on the purpose of your web hosting package. A single, small slice of hosting real estate for a personal blog does not cost the same as running a large e-commerce store. Set a budget that you can easily afford to find the right provider.Contract terms: The best deals are available for longer hosting periods, but you may only want to sign up for a few months or years. Check out the plans on offer and decide if they align with your goals.Scalability: Consider your website's most important functions or uses. If you expect to grow your business over time and experience high traffic, you need to be able to scale your hosting capabilities accordingly. Choose a provider with upgrade options -- and preferably ones that won't break the bank. CMS support and templates: New website owners may want to launch their website without hiring a designer to create a custom template from scratch. See if your new host offers an easy-to-use content management system (CMS) platform for backend updates, and whether website design templates are available.Customer support: Customer support is extremely important when you sign up for a web hosting service. Whether you are a beginner or want to run many websites, you should choose a provider with different options and a reputation for solid support.Money-back guarantee: Choosing web hosting can require a long-term investment, and so you might want to take advantage of a money-back guarantee while making your decision. Research your chosen provider to find out if one is on offer. AI: If you're interested in testing out AI tools for support or taking over the entire job of building your initial website, check that your chosen web hosting provider offers these services. For example, you might want to use an AI engine to create your website, a design template, or to tweak your website's SEO. Many web hosts now provide some form of AI, but not all.

How did I choose these web hosting services?
When I compiled this list, I began with web hosts ZDNET authors are personally familiar with. ZDNET does extensive testing on and research into web hosting providers, taking into consideration user reviews, competitor analysis, personal usage and experiences, and more.Some of us have been running production websites for decades, with sites that have served millions of pages. Others have used web hosts for personal blogs, writing projects, and to help individuals launch small businesses. I chose these providers because I believe they offer some of the best services in the market. These are the main factors I considered:Features offered: Deciding on the best web hosting provider requires you to decide which features to prioritize. I've included options for CMS implementation, e-commerce, design services, SEO services, cybersecurity functions, and more. Price: Naturally, the price point is a very important factor when we choose my web hosting provider recommendations. I have included options suitable for varying budgets, all the way from personal blogs to small businesses and large enterprise setups that will need to scale.Contracts: I have endeavored to include a range of subscriptions and plans, including flexible options suitable for different web projects. Stability: I have included only reputable web hosting providers that provide stable services with minimal downtime. After all, there's no point in having a speedy, responsive website if downtime is a constant problem.Security: It is important that web hosting services take security seriously, so I have avoided hosts known for frequent security problems and those that lack transparency.Customer experiences: If you are going to sign up for a long-term web hosting service, you need to know how the company treats and supports its customers. I have examined customer reviews and feedback, with a particular focus of the support channels on offer and how responsive customer support teams are.

Latest news in the web hosting industry  A group of cybersecurity groups, including the National Security Agency (NSA), warned that Chinese tech companies may be indirectly collaborating with hacking group Salt Typhoon. The US Treasury sanctioned a web hosting provider in the Philippines for allegedly being linked to cryptocurrency and "pig butchering" scams. The FTC ordered GoDaddy to implement a comprehensive security program following several data breach incidents. The organization also alleged the company misrepresented its security practices to consumers. FAQs on web hosting services
Which web host is best for beginners?
Wix, Hosting.com, and Squarespace are among the web hosts I would recommend for beginners, although many are out there. These platforms offer an abundance of creative templates, so users can gain experience in web development with an attractive site. If you have experience with content management system (CMS) platforms, you could also look at WordPress.com.
Show more
Can you sign up for free web hosting?
Yes. There are many sites that allow for free hosting, but you will likely have a generic, branded domain. For example, if you were to have a free WordPress website, your domain would be [yourwebsitename].wordpress.com. Be careful: Many free offers end after a period of time, and then you're stuck on a service that will likely charge you a considerable additional fee to keep using it. Alternatively, the website host may allow you to have a free website on the condition that you allow ads to be displayed.

How much can web hosting cost?
Web hosting can cost as little as a few dollars per month. Large-scale projects that require vast storage space and those that expect heavy volumes of traffic may need more support and resources, which will bump up the price. Enterprise-grade hosting can exceed hundreds of dollars per month, but this is overkill for many website owners.
Show more
Is web hosting the same as a domain?
No. A web host is the space you rent or own that stores files, whereas a web domain, such as www.mywebsite.com, is the address visitors need to find your website. You need both for a functioning website.

What are the best WordPress hosting services?
If we're talking web hosts, we have to talk about WordPress. About 61% of websites with content management systems use the open-source CMS. The WordPress ecosystem is huge, and finding the right WordPress host is a challenge on its own. Beyond WordPress.com, the service offered by the creators of the CMS, there are numerous managed hosting providers. There are even more hosting providers that specialize in providing a WordPress-optimized server for your website. Nearly every hosting provider will allow a WordPress install, considering its popularity.

What are the best point-and-click website builders?
A website builder is a type of software that lets you craft your business website, generally without programming knowledge or experience. Many allow you to choose from templates and then modify those templates to suit your look and layout.Nearly all web hosting providers include some kind of website-building software, but for most hosting plans, it's often an afterthought. By contrast, the website builders listed in this section are provided by web hosting companies that have made point-and-click website building tools with excellent customer support and solid up-time. You do sacrifice some control when choosing a website builder solution, but if you've never done any web development, and you want a beautiful, usable website quickly, these services are for you. One warning: There are a lot of lock-ins here. You won't be able to transfer the look of your site, and sometimes the content, to another hosting provider easily. Keep that in mind when you choose a website builder.

What is the difference between a web host and a web server?
A web host is a service provider, such as Wix or GoDaddy, that provides the space, storage, and resources required to keep a website online, typically under a rental agreement. A web server is a computer system that stores files and shares them to become accessible to the web.

What are the main disadvantages of shared web hosting?
Shared web hosting is often very affordable and easy to set up, but it does come with a few disadvantages compared to dedicated or VPS hosting. Shared hosting plans pool computing resources between users, which means their web projects will share resources, including RAM and bandwidth. You will also likely be limited in terms of storage.

Why is my domain being blocked?
There can be many reasons why a domain is being blocked or becomes inaccessible. These can include illegal material or malware being hosted -- either due to an infection or intentionally -- or a configuration error. You can visit VirusTotal and run a scan on your domain to see if your website is being flagged as malicious. Many ISPs rely on third-party scans in their firewall systems, and so any red flags -- even if they are incorrect -- can result in your domain being blocked. This happened to me once, when I unwittingly purchased a domain that had been used to distribute ransomware years prior. It took several months of reaching out to ISPs and the cybersecurity companies that flagged my domain to resolve the problem -- but if you are just as unfortunate, companies are out there to assist you.
