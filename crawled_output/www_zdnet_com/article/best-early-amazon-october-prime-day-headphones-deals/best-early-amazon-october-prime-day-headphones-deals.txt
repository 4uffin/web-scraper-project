When is October Prime Day 2025? This year, Amazon's October Prime Day sale runs on October 7 and October 8. The annual sale will last for two days in the fall, and you can expect to see a range of deals on household goods, tech gadgets, and electronics, including laptops, PCs, and headphones. Are headphones really cheaper on Prime Day? Yes, you can find headphones at discounted prices during Prime Day. I spend a lot of time testing headphones and tracking their retail and discounted prices. All of the headphones, earbuds, and Bluetooth speakers included in this list are discounted from their original sale price. How did we choose these October Prime Day deals?ZDNET authors only write about deals that interest us personally and include products that we own or want to buy. Our experts looked for deals that were at least 20% off (or are normally not on sale, as is often the case with Apple devices), using established price comparison tools and trackers to determine whether the deal actually represents value for your money.We also explored customer reviews to find out what matters to those who already own and use the products and deals we're recommending. Our recommendations may also be based on our own testing.
