What is the best laptop right now?Our pick for the overall best laptop is the M4 MacBook Pro. It has nearly everything you could want in a laptop: a long-lasting battery, top-tier performance, and a vibrant display. It checks off all the boxes and looks as good as it performs, but we're aware it's not for everyone. Our curated list includes a broad range of laptops we're confident will be useful to most everyone. Also: How to clear the cache on your Windows 11 PC (and why you shouldn't wait to do it)

View now at AmazonView now at Apple Why we like it: The MacBook Pro M4 checks of all the boxes of what you want in a laptop: impressive performance, a banger display, sleek and portable form factor, and Apple's ever-improving ecosystem of features. The M4 is the latest chipset in Apple's silicon line, with a 10-core central processing unit (CPU) and a 10-core graphics processing unit (GPU). As far as memory goes, you can go up to 32GB with up to 2TB of storage.Review: MacBook Pro (M4)Who it's for: The vast majority of users will find something to like about the MacBook Pro M4. Whether for photo editing, creative tasks, productivity workflows, or gaming, the M4 does it smoothly, even outperforming the old M1 Pro chip. That's the name of the game here, the M4 is not a massive leap forward from last year's M3; it's a refinement of what already works. The MacBook Pro M4, then, is the culmination of Apple's MacBook device lineup: a joy to use with a brilliant, nano-texture display that supports two external monitors with the lid open, a fantastic video conferencing experience, and a sleek 3.4-pound form factor that set the standard for portability.Also: Best Linux laptops of 2025Who should look elsewhere: If you're on a limited budget, the MacBook Pro M4 is going to be a hard sell, as prices start around $1,500 and only go up from there. This is a flagship laptop that can do a little bit of everything, so if you're just looking for something for simple, everyday tasks, you're better off shopping for something under the $1,000 mark. MacBook Pro M4 (14-inch) specs: Display size: 14-inch Liquid Retina XDR | Resolution: 3024 x 1964 pixels | RAM: Up to 24GB | Storage: 1TB | CPU: 10-core M4 | Battery life: 16 hours | Weight: 3.4 lbs.

View now at B&H Photo-Video Why we like it: The ThinkPad E14 is a dependable, lightweight laptop you can take with you to the office and rely on to handle business for a competitive price point. Armed with an Intel Core 5 125U or 7 155U processor and anywhere from 8GB to 32GB of RAM, you have a device ready for everyday workflows and multitasking across multiple programs and documents. Who it's for: If you're looking for a dependable laptop for work with a reliable legacy behind it, Lenovo's ThinkPad lineup is the best place to start. These devices come in a broad range of models and array of configurations, with the E14 being one of the best affordable laptops for work out there. Starting at $849, it brings many of the ThinkPad's unique features but keeps the hardware on the modest end, making it a solid workhorse for most workflows and a reliable laptop for teams that don't need high-powered, specialized devices. Review: Lenovo ThinkPad E14 (Gen 6)Who should look elsewhere: This is an affordable workhorse laptop, so it's not made for intensive visual tasks or gaming. Additionally, although the webcam is standard fare for laptop videoconferencing, the default 720p cam isn't going to win any awards for clarity, so I would elect for the 1080p camera upgrade if you want to look sharp on calls. Lenovo ThinkPad E14 (Gen 6) specs: Display size: 14-inch | Display type: IPS | Resolution: 1920 x 1200  (WUXGA) | RAM: 8GB-32GB | Storage: Up to 1TB

View now at B&H Photo-Video Why we like it: HP's EliteBook X G1s is a business laptop through and through, exuding a professional aesthetic while seeking to combine the connectivity of a ThinkPad, the sleek form factor of a MacBook, and HP's signature minimalist, if non-descript, design.   There are a few configurations of this laptop, the most premium featuring an AMD Ryzen AI 9 processor -- one of the most cutting-edge chips on the market right now -- and an OLED display up to 120Hz refresh rate for a premium, crisp working experience. Review: HP EliteBook X G1aWho it's for: Anyone seeking a premium work laptop, with special attention to those seeking an ergonomic keyboard that's utterly silent and snappy. During my testing, I found this laptop really enjoyable to use for long days at work, and a big part of that was due to its well-designed ergonomics. But it's not just satisfying to use, this is a powerhouse that's armed for serious multitasking and CPU-heavy workloads. In our testing, we got multi-core performance numbers that approach the MacBook Pro M4. Who should look elsewhere: This is an premium laptop with top-tier hardware. If you're just looking for a reliable device for checking emails and working out of a browser, you'll be better off with our previous pick, the Lenovo ThinkPad E14. HP EliteBook X G1a specs: Display size: 14-inch Touchscreen | Display type: OLED | Resolution: 2880 x 1800 (2.8K) | RAM: 32GB, 64GB | Storage: 1TB PCIe 4.0 x4 SSD | CPU: AMD Ryzen AI 7 PRO 360 | GPU: AMD Radeon 880M | Battery life: Up to 11 hours | Weight: 3.3 lbs.

View now at Best Buy Why we like it: When Asus officially announced the  at CES this year, I wasn't the only one to be low-key enamored with it. It's a great laptop in its own right, but it stands out with its successful balancing act between performance and affordability while hitting all the right notes that consumers care about. Hands down, the best part of this laptop is the outstanding battery life, though. Asus advertises up to 32 hours on a single charge. Although that's the top end of the estimation, it's not far off from what you can expect with everyday use.Review: Asus Zenbook A14Who it's for: It's a sleek and lightweight laptop for the modern professional who lives in the cloud, works remotely, and values aesthetics. In addition, the Zenbook A14 boots quickly, loads apps swiftly, and navigates the web without lag. It runs silent and cool, generating almost no heat -- even with the slim form factor. Made of Asus' proprietary ceraluminum material, the Zenbook A14 is exceedingly light, weighing just 2.1 pounds. For reference, the 13-inch MacBook Air is 2.7 pounds. When you set it down, the device opens easily with the lift of a single finger, revealing the brilliant OLED display. Who should look elsewhere: This lightweight form and next-gen battery efficiency comes with a tradeoff in the form of raw power. If you need something with beefier hardware for more intensive workloads, check out the HP EliteBook X G1a or the MacBook Air M4. Asus Zenbook A14 specs: Display size: 14 inches | Display type: OLED | Resolution: 1920 x 1200 (Full HD+) | RAM: 16GB or 32GB | Storage: 1TB SSD | CPU: Snapdragon X or X Plus | GPU: Qualcomm Adreno | Battery life: Up to 32 hours of video playback | Weight: 2.1 lbs

View now at Lenovo Why we like it: Lenovo's Yoga 7i 2-in-1 16 doesn't aim to dazzle you with flashy features. Instead, it focuses on what matters most for a work computer: delivering dependable performance with the flexibility that a 2-in-1 design provides. In that sense, it's a fantastic 2-in-1 that's especially comfortable to use. It features an Intel Core Ultra 5 processor -- a standard midrange chip -- and 16GB of RAM for reliable performance that keeps costs competitive but has enough power for the majority of users. Review: Lenovo Yoga 7i 2-in-1 16Who it's for: We recommend this device for anyone who wants to bring a 2-in-1 to the office. It's also a comfortable laptop to use, with a large trackpad and full-sized keyboard with a key travel distance of 1.5mm, enabling fast typing while also reducing hand fatigue. If you like using a stylus, the associated Yoga Pen pairs well with the device's large display, either in tent or tablet mode. Who should look elsewhere: Anyone looking for an ultraportable, as this 16-inch device isn't the lightest. Instead, its size and durability make for a stalwart and flexible device for the office. Lenovo Yoga 7i 2-in-1 16 specs: Display size: 16 inches | Display type: IPS Touchscreen | Resolution:

View now at Amazon Why we like it: Acer's Aspire Go 15 is our pick for best budget laptop. For less than $300, you get a portable notebook built to cover the basics. What it lacks in fancy aesthetics or premium features, this device makes up for it by being a solid secondary computer for students or professionals. Powered by an Intel Core i3-N305 and 8GB of RAM, the device can handle lightweight productivity tasks well. Its 15-inch 1080p display provides decent viewing angles and sufficient contrast with a modest level of brightness.Review: Acer Aspire Go 15Who it's for: Anyone looking for an inexpensive laptop that can do the basics and appreciates the mid-size 15-inch screen. The Aspire Go 15's full-sized keyboard and well-placed trackpad emulate a more premium experience, and its battery life is quite good for the price, lasting over 10 hours during our video playback tests. What's more, the laptop can be versatile thanks to a standard selection of ports, including USB-A, USB-C, and HDMI.Who should look elsewhere: Anyone looking for a powerful main driver with future-proofed hardware. While the Aspire Go 15 is fantastic for the price, it's not going to compete with the performance found on the more powerful laptops on this list. Also: Best free antivirus software of 2025Acer Aspire Go specs: Display size: 15 inches | Display type: LCD | Resolution: 1920 x 1080| RAM: 8GB | Storage: 128GB UFS | CPU: Intel Core i3-N305 | Battery life: Up to 11 hours | Weight: 3.86 lbs.

Why we like it: Acer's Aspire Go 15 is our pick for best budget laptop. For less than $300, you get a portable notebook built to cover the basics. What it lacks in fancy aesthetics or premium features, this device makes up for it by being a solid secondary computer for students or professionals. Powered by an Intel Core i3-N305 and 8GB of RAM, the device can handle lightweight productivity tasks well. Its 15-inch 1080p display provides decent viewing angles and sufficient contrast with a modest level of brightness.Review: Acer Aspire Go 15Who it's for: Anyone looking for an inexpensive laptop that can do the basics and appreciates the mid-size 15-inch screen. The Aspire Go 15's full-sized keyboard and well-placed trackpad emulate a more premium experience, and its battery life is quite good for the price, lasting over 10 hours during our video playback tests. What's more, the laptop can be versatile thanks to a standard selection of ports, including USB-A, USB-C, and HDMI.Who should look elsewhere: Anyone looking for a powerful main driver with future-proofed hardware. While the Aspire Go 15 is fantastic for the price, it's not going to compete with the performance found on the more powerful laptops on this list. Also: Best free antivirus software of 2025Acer Aspire Go specs: Display size: 15 inches | Display type: LCD | Resolution: 1920 x 1080| RAM: 8GB | Storage: 128GB UFS | CPU: Intel Core i3-N305 | Battery life: Up to 11 hours | Weight: 3.86 lbs.

How we test laptops
We use a combination of methods to test laptops here at ZDNET. First, we acquire data from benchmarking software to analyze a system's metrics under the hood and compare those to advertised numbers. Then, we spend an extended amount of time with the laptop -- usually a week or two -- using it the same way a normal consumer would, to assess its portability, form factor, and how well the battery actually holds up. For an extensive breakdown, check out our comprehensive laptop testing methodology.Benchmarking: First, we run a series of tests to put the computer's hardware through the wringer in order to see what it's capable of. Cinebench is one of the most commonly used hardware testing suites, which tests the laptop's rendering performance on single and multiple central processing unit (CPU) cores. PCMark 10 is another powerful program that covers a wide variety of tasks performed in the workplace, and there are many others that we use in tandem to gather as much data as we can. Some components we run tests on include:Processor: The "brain" of the laptop and one of the most important factors that determines performance. The four biggest manufacturers that make most of the CPUs found in laptops today are Intel, AMD, Qualcomm, and Apple -- in Apple machines only. This is tested in benchmarking software.The display: The size of the display -- measured diagonally from corner to corner -- is also what dictates the laptop's overall size and plays a big role in the device's cost. Brightness is measured in "nits," and color spectrums are tested in benchmarking software.The graphics processor (GPU): Whether it's integrated into the CPU or a dedicated graphics card, how well the machine handles graphics is a key factor when it comes to demanding tasks like video editing, rendering, and of course, gaming. We test the GPU with a combination of benchmarking software, gaming, and media playback. Physical form factor: Finally, the laptop's overall appearance and physical form factor encompasses its weight, thickness, how the keyboard and trackpad feel, and whether it has a display that can be folded back to form a tablet. We carry the laptop around for at least a week and note how well it commutes.Battery testing: We test a unit's battery in a few ways. A handful of benchmarking programs have their own battery testing components, but we also will just let the laptop run for as long as it can under a medium load. We ensure screensavers and hibernation mode are turned off, set the display's brightness and audio at 50%, load up a livestream on YouTube in Chrome, and wait 'til the end.The human element:  As we mentioned earlier, metrics and system data is important, but numbers alone don't give you the full picture. This is where we weave in our personal experience with the device and tap into the practical use cases that consumers actually care about. Ultimately, our goal is to break down the capabilities of each and every laptop we test into digestible terms that real people find useful. There is a lot of noise and confusion when it comes to navigating the laptop and computer consumer market, so we hope to bring an intuitive element to the whole process by leveraging our team's decades of experience.

What are some factors to consider when choosing the best laptops?
Multiple factors influence the choice of laptops for this list. We look for machines with great designs, performance, and effective storage and RAM. We also considered the different purposes for which you may need or use your laptop and the overall value -- including the price point -- that the laptop promises. Design: Whether your laptop is your ultimate workstation or source of entertainment, its design, display, and portability determine how you interact with the unit. Performance: For many, laptops are essential for workflow and communication. The best laptops promise efficient speed and performance, powered by the greatest and latest chipsets -- like the Apple M4 Max. Storage and RAM: It's likely you'll use a laptop to store key documents or memories, and the best models have plenty of room for you to do so.Purpose: We strive to answer the question, "What laptop should I get if ___" as we know you have different workflow and entertainment needs and preferences, from graphic design to gaming. Value: The best laptop can be a pricey investment, so we considered qualities that assure you'll get your money's worth.

FAQs on laptops
Why should you buy a laptop, and not a desktop or a tablet?
While the desktop form factor, especially in the form of all-in-one (AIO) devices, still exists, laptops come in various sizes and cover many use cases. They range from thin, light, and ultraportable to bulky, powerful, and deskbound. Because of how good laptops are nowadays, most people opt for sticking with a laptop to serve as their main computer. If a small laptop screen is an issue, an external monitor can be connected.

Are refurbished laptops a viable option?
Definitely. Despite what the big brands think, not everyone has the budget for a brand new laptop every few years. Purchasing a refurbished laptop will save you some money while also giving life to a perfectly good machine.
If you're worried about its performance, don't be. There's a big difference between "used" and "refurbished", with the latter meaning the device has gone through a quality control check by experts to make sure everything is up to par.
That means the hardware has been verified to be in good shape (and replaced, if need be) and the software/operating system are in working order. Just keep in mind that refurbished laptops often come with the hardware they shipped with, so it's not going to be the newest, top-of-the-line components. You'll still get a device that will suit your needs, though, and saving hundreds of dollars in the process. One of the main things to look out for with refurbished laptops is the warranty it comes with. You'll want to make sure you have at least a year of coverage, but preferably more, in case something breaks down or you need a repair.
You can purchase a refurbished laptop at reputable resellers like Backmarket and eBay, but the big brands like Dell and Lenovo also have their own refurbished sites, which we highly recommend, as they often put a little more care into their own products.

What are the different kinds of laptops?
Laptops come in a variety of different form factors these days, with manufacturers playing into the different categories to develop an intended use case. For example, lightweight laptops are made to be carried around, and trade in some raw power for portability. 2-in-1 laptops come with touchscreens that allow for use as a tablet. The best form factor for you reflects how you think you'll use the device. Lightweight/ultraportable laptopsMade for students, hybrid workers, and anyone who needs to commute with their laptop. These devices have seen a huge explosion in the past few years, becoming thinner and lighter than ever. Some good examples are the Asus Zenbook A14, the Apple MacBook Air M4, and the Lenovo ThinkPad X9 Aura Edition -- all devices we've tested and love for their ultraportable forms relative to power and battery life. Business laptopsDesigned for the office, these laptops often come with more RAM and local storage, but less powerful GPUs. Their physical designs are often sleek, neutral, and corporate, and they feature lots of ports for compatibility purposes. Premium work laptops may have extra touches like OLED screens (like the HP EliteBook X G1a) or haptic trackpads (Lenovo's
ThinkPad X9 Aura Edition) to match the high-end hardware. 2-in-1 laptopsAlso called convertibles, these laptops allow for the screen to be folded all the way back so it can act as a tablet or be used in "tent mode" to display media. Some 2-in-1 laptops we're big fans of are the Lenovo Yoga 7i 2-in-1 16 and the Dell 16 Plus 2-in-1. Gaming LaptopsAs the name suggests, these are laptops made to run games, and as such come with the hardware to support that. We're talking high-end GPUs, large, vivid displays, and often, RGB lighting and other physical design effects that set them apart from business laptops. While they're designed to run the latest titles, they also can double as good machines for creatives thanks to their high-end hardware, and as such, tend to be pricier. Some gaming laptops we love are the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i and the
Alienware Area-51m 18. MacBooksApple's line of MacBooks are premium devices with a host of features that integrate into the Apple ecosystem. The hardware on MacBooks is arguably some of the best in the industry, with things like gorgeous Liquid Retina displays, crisp, clear webcams, and Apple's line of Silicon processors, which have some of the most impressive performance on the market. The trade-off is the cost, which start around the $1,000 mark and go upwards from there. ChromebooksGoogle's Chromebook lineup uses its own operating system -- ChromeOS -- to power its lineup of light and affordable laptops. Putting a streamlined, limited OS onto a laptop with modest hardware means you forgo the sprawling memory demands of Windows, and run 8GB of RAM smoothly and efficiently. We're big fans of Chromebooks at ZDNET, with some of our favorites being the Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14, the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus, and the Acer Chromebook Plus 516 GE.

Which operating system should you choose: Windows, MacOS, ChromeOS, or Linux?
While every computing platform has its loyal supporters, most people end up using a particular operating system because of key applications running on it, employer preferences, or budgetary constraints. Windows, which ranges from budget to premium, and Apple's MacOS, which is exclusive to premium devices, cover a broad spectrum. ChromeOS is mostly limited to mid-range devices.Also: For anonymous browsing, these extensions are the next best thing to TorAll Windows devices listed here meet the requirements for Windows 11.

What are the best laptops for video editing?
We strongly recommend getting an M4 MacBook and purchasing Final Cut Pro, an editing software exclusive to the Mac ecosystem. Buying the 2023 MacBook Pro is another good option.

The machine can handle 4TB of footage with ease.Review: The best laptops for video editing: Expert testedIf you're looking for a Windows device, we recommend the Asus ProArt P16, our top pick for creators with its vivid display, impressive hardware, and features specifically for creatives like customizable DialPad.
