Elyse Betters Picaro / ZDNETFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.ZDNET's key takeawaysiOS 26 adds full-screen previews to iPhone screenshots.New AI tools let you image search and ask ChatGPT.You can enable or disable full-screen previews in Settings.When you take a screenshot on your iPhone or iPad, a small thumbnail appears in the bottom corner. Tap it, and you can edit, crop, or share the screenshot before saving. In iOS 26 and iPadOS 26, that process has a whole new look with additional tools.Now, when you tap a thumbnail, you'll enter a full-screen preview mode -- complete with markup tools, crop and scale options, a sharing shortcut, and Apple's new Visual Intelligence features. These include Image Search, which helps you find similar items on Google, and Highlight to Search, which narrows results to a specific area of the screenshot. You can also add events directly to your calendar from screenshots, and use the built-in Ask ChatGPT feature to get explanations or context about what's on screen. Also: Downloading iOS 26? Do these 6 things on your iPhone first (and thank me later)But here's something you might not know: After enabling a setting, you won't need to tap a screenshot thumbnail to access the new full-screen preview. Instead, full-screen previews will pop up automatically the moment you take a screenshot.
If you don't want to modify the screenshot after capturing one, just swipe away the preview and move on with your day. If you later decide that full-screen previews are not useful, you can easily disable the setting and revert to the default behavior.
How to enable full-screen previews on iPhone and iPad What you'll need: Apple released iOS 26 and iPadOS 26 in September, so make sure your devices are updated to the latest software. You'll need to be running at least these versions to see full-screen previews and access the setting.
1. Go to General in the Settings app
Once you're running iOS 26 or iPadOS 26, unlock your device, open the Settings app, scroll down to General, and tap it.Also: Why I'm skipping the iPhone 17 this year (and it's not just about the money)

2. Select Screen Capture
Within the General menu, look for the Screen Capture option. Apple placed all screenshot-related controls here, making it easy for you to manage previews, formats, and other features.

3. Toggle on Full-Screen Previews
Turn on the switch next to Full-Screen Previews so that it's green. From now on, every time you take a screenshot, it will open instantly in the full-screen preview instead of just appearing as a small corner thumbnail.Also: How to clear your iPhone cache (and why you should do it before updating to iOS 26)

4. Take a screenshot and start playing
Once you've enabled full-screen previews, capturing a screenshot is as simple as pressing the Side button and Volume Up button at the same time. Instead of a small thumbnail, your screenshot will now open in a full-screen editor with tool icons along the bottom of the display.On the bottom left, you'll see the Ask button for ChatGPT.Â On the bottom right is the Image Search button for reverse searches.Â You can also use Highlight to Search by pressing and dragging your finger across a specific part of the screenshot to focus results only on that area.Â In the middle, Visual Intelligence's contextual options will appear -- if you have an iPhone 15 or later. These vary depending on what's detected in the screenshot, such as Add to Calendar for events.At the top, you'll find the familiar markup pen icon for drawing and annotations, along with share and crop options and the ability to select text. If you captured a webpage or a particularly long page, you will even see a new tab to switch to a full-page preview. This lets you scroll to see the entire length of the screenshot.

Elyse Betters Picaro / ZDNETFAQs
What can Visual Intelligence do on screenshots?Apple's Visual Intelligence is handy for translating signs, dialing phone numbers, identifying plants or landmarks, and pulling up business info. Until now, however, it only worked through the camera. Apple has removed that limitation by baking Visual Intelligence directly into its new screenshot interface. Now, any screenshot can be analyzed with AI on an iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 16, or newer.Also:Â Don't like Apple's new Liquid Glass look? Here's how to tone it downWhen you capture a screenshot, the full-screen preview includes new buttons to askÂ ChatGPTÂ about the content or get contextual information like translations, the ability to select, copy, and summarize text, call numbers, bring upÂ Maps, add toÂ Calendar, and more. You can even select a specific part of the screenshot to conduct a similar or reverse image search.
Elyse Betters Picaro / ZDNETHow to disable full-screen previewsDon't like the new screenshot experience? You can quickly turn it off and go back to the thumbnail workflow. Open Settings.Tap General.Choose Screen Capture.Toggle off Full-Screen Previews. Can I still markup if I disable full-screen previews? Yes. Just tap the thumbnail in the corner after taking a screenshot, and you'll get the full-screen preview and all its editing options. How to exit a full-screen preview 	You can dismiss a full-screen preview the moment it pops up or when you're done editing the screenshot. Take a screenshot.When the full-screen preview appears, swipe up from the bottom (or tap Done in the top corner). Do full-screen previews save automatically? Yes. Even if you swipe the preview away, the screenshot is still saved to your Photos app. What other screenshot options can I try? When you're in the Screen Capture area of Settings > General, check out a few of the new options available: HDR Screenshots: Saves captures in HEIF format with richer color.CarPlay Screenshots: Lets you capture CarPlay interfaces when connected.Visual Lookup: Available on iPhone 15 Pro and newer, for object recognition and AI insights.
