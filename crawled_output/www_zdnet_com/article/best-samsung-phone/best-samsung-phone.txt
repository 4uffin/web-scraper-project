Samsung is heading into the fall season with some serious momentum, with several flagship Android phones already under its belt in 2025, including the highly capable Galaxy S25 Ultra and ultra-thin Galaxy S25 Edge. The recently announced Galaxy Z series, consisting of the Z Fold 7 and Z Flip 7, rounds out the brand's summer releases. Put simply, you really can't go wrong with any of the phones Samsung has launched this year.But, like any other range of phones, Samsung has a phone for every pocket and every budget. If you need a good everyday phone, Samsung has the Galaxy S25. If you want something compact, Samsung has the Galaxy Z Flip 7. If you want something durable, Samsung has those as well. We have tested them all, so here are our picks for the best Samsung phones you can buy today.What is the best Samsung phone right now?After extensively testing the latest phones on the market, I've found that the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is the best Samsung phone right now, with the company's top-of-the-line features and specifications, including an S Pen stylus for precision inputs, a 200MP camera system, and the most durable display on any Galaxy phone yet. The size and abundance of features of the S25 Ultra may almost be overwhelming for some users, but you certainly get what you pay for, with its starting price of $1,299.Our runner-ups on this list are just as noteworthy. The smaller Galaxy S25 Plus variant is nearly as capable as the Ultra model but costs at least $300 less. You'll lose the S Pen and 200MP camera but retain most of the software AI features and AMOLED display. For something more experiential, consider the Galaxy Z Flip 7, which flips and folds into a pocketable square and is accessibly priced.Also: The best Android phones to buy in 2025

$1,075 at Amazon$1,075 at Samsung$1,075 at Best Buy Why we like it: The Galaxy S25 Ultra stands out as the premier handset in Samsung's lineup, largely thanks to its robust Galaxy AI capabilities and far-reaching hardware features. The latest Galaxy AI suite brings practical and useful features like real-time call translation, voice commands that work across multiple apps, and photo editing capabilities. My real-world testing suggests these AI functions surpass those on competing Android devices in speed, consistency, and overall usefulness. Beyond the AI, the phone has impressed us with its large 6.9-inch, anti-reflective, AMOLED display and a reliable 5,000mAh battery. It helps that the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset, 12GB of RAM, and improved vapor cooling chamber all contribute to a more power-efficient experience. Durability is another key strength you should be aware of, owing to its lightweight titanium frame and resilient Corning Gorilla Armor 2 glass. Sure, you'll see some microscratches from everyday use, but cracking the Ultra model is harder than ever.Furthermore, the camera system is significantly upgraded with a 50MP ultrawide lens that captures landscape and macro shots with greater detail and vibrancy. We've run several camera tests between the S25 Ultra and competing phones like the iPhone 16 Pro Max and Google Pixel 10 Pro XL, and found the Samsung model to deliver the sharpest and vibrant imagery.Review: Samsung Galaxy S25 UltraWho it's for: The Galaxy S25 Ultra is primarily targeted toward users who demand the best smartphone experience Samsung can provide and are keen to explore the latest consumer-facing AI features. It represents a particularly compelling upgrade for individuals holding onto three to four-year-old devices, offering significant advancements across the board. The durable build makes it an excellent choice for those who prioritize drop protection and longevity. Multimedia enthusiasts will appreciate the large, anti-reflective, 6.9-inch screen combined with enhanced cooling for smooth gaming and movie playback. Additionally, photography lovers looking for improved detail and color in wide-angle and close-up macro shots will find the new 50MP ultrawide camera valuable.Who should look elsewhere: Despite its strengths, the Galaxy S25 Ultra isn't my top choice for everyone. Its $1,299 price point puts it out of reach for budget-conscious consumers, and users who frequently utilize the S Pen's Bluetooth gestures for actions like remotely triggering the camera may be disappointed, as the functionality has been removed. Furthermore, individuals who prefer a less angular or "boxy" phone design might find the standard Galaxy S25 Plus or S25 Edge models more aesthetically pleasing and comfortable to hold. If you don't require the absolute pinnacle of performance, the largest possible screen, or the most advanced camera system Samsung offers, the more affordable S25 Plus and S25 Edge provide many similar core features and represent better value.Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra specs: Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy | Display size: 6.9 inches | Storage options: Up to 1TB | Rear cameras: 200MP main, 50MP ultrawide, 50MP telephoto with 5x zoom, 10MP telephoto with 3x zoom  | Front camera: 12MP | Battery: 5,000mAh | Price: Starting at $1,299

$800 at Best Buy$800 at Amazon$800 at Samsung Why we like it: There is something about a small phone with flagship specs that gets our juices flowing. Not many phone makers produce flagship phones with 6.2-inch (or smaller) screens. They're attractive because they're more comfortable to use one-handed without compromising on specifications. Sure, the battery is smaller -- it has to be, but beyond that, the Galaxy S25 is a powerful phone that checks all the right boxes. With the S25 serving as the base model for the lineup that also includes the S25 Plus and the S25 Ultra, it rounds out a selection of phones of all sizes, sharing the same specifications throughout the lineup. So you're not missing out on anything by choosing the smallest (and least expensive) flagship in Samsung's arsenal.Review: Samsung Galaxy S25Who it's for: Small phone fans can rejoice that this puny pocket powerhouse is available for those who want all the power and performance of a flagship phone, but don't want to carry around a small airplane runway in their skinny jeans. People with frequent access to electricity will also be fans. The 4,000mAh battery can last a day with light to medium usage, but it can definitely survive a day if you can drop it on a charger while you work, for example.Another set of users who will want to use this phone -- or any other phone in this list -- are Samsung ecosystem customers. Samsung has tablets, laptops, and wearables that all work better with a Samsung phone in your pocket, so the S25 would be a good option for those who already have a Galaxy Watch 8, Galaxy Ring, or Galaxy Tab S10 FE.Who should look elsewhere: Battery life is the chief concern with this phone. During my testing, I found that the phone can last a day, even with medium to heavy usage away from Wi-Fi, but only just. That's fine, but in this day and age, flagship phones will usually last for a day and a half, meaning if you forget to plug in your phone overnight, you can wake up and make it to work before you'll need to charge again. That's not the case here.The Galaxy S25 also doesn't have the S25 Ultra's camera chops. The S25 Ultra has larger and better camera sensors for all three cameras (and adds an extra telephoto besides). So if you're looking for absolutely top-notch photography, this phone isn't the one for you.Samsung Galaxy S25 specs: Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy | Display size: 6.2 inches | Storage options: Up to 1TB | Rear cameras: 50MP main, 12MP ultrawide, and 10MP telephoto (3x) | Front camera: 12MP | Battery: 4,000mAh | Price: Starting at $799
Pros
Polished and sleek designs feel better than ever
Snappy performance with an Ultra-level processor
7 years of OS updates is the industry standard
Cons
Samsung's software can be overbearing
No Qi2/faster charging speeds
Uncertainties with Galaxy AI features, like whether they'll be under a subscription next year

$2,000 at Amazon$2,000 at Samsung$2,000 at Best Buy Why we like it: The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 is the best foldable phone going into the rest of 2025, thanks to its ultra-thin form factor and market-leading camera system, which captures more lifelike images than competing models from OnePlus and Google, based on our tests. Samsung took the traditional smartphone route when refining the outer display of the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7, opting for a wider, more regular aspect ratio panel than last year's narrower Galaxy Z Fold 6. That makes a notable difference in hand-feel and ergonomics, even though the two phones are only $100 apart. Compared to the standard slab-style phone, you're simply getting more screen with the Z Fold 7, with a larger 8-inch display when unfolded. For reference, most modern-day phones range from 6 to 6.8 inches.Naturally, all the content I've been consuming on the phone, like video streaming, social media feeds, and Google Maps, is portrayed in a highly consumable manner; nothing feels disorienting or cropped out. While the foldable doesn't match its Ultra sibling spec-for-spec, the Z Fold 7 truly shines and more than makes up for the "inferior" 200MP camera system in long exposure shots and selfies, thanks to its self-standing nature. Review: Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7Who it's for: I often recommend the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold over other foldables because of Samsung's feature-rich approach to software. Running on the OneUI launcher (over Android 16) means you can expect a simple yet customizable user interface, with support for up to seven years of operating system and security updates. I can't say the same for the OnePlus Open or Motorola Razr.This ultra-slim form factor is also ideal for multitaskers and other users who want to see as much information at once as possible without reaching for a tablet or laptop. You simply won't find a foldable with better ergonomics right now than this.Who should look elsewhere: With a starting price tag of $1,999, you're mostly paying for the innovation factor with this phone. So if you're more interested in a safe and reliable handset that's arguably much easier to repair, then I'd recommend a traditional slab phone like the Samsung Galaxy S25 series instead.Users shopping for a foldable phone should consider the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold if they prefer a handset with less bloatware and a stubbier design, or last year's Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 if they want S Pen stylus support, which the Z Fold 7 omits.Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 tech specs: Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite | Display sizes: 6.5-inch exterior and 8-inch interior | Storage options: 256GB, 512GB, or 1TB | Rear cameras: 200MP wide, 12MP ultrawide, 10MP telephoto | Front cameras: 10MP front | Battery: 4,400mAh | Price: Starting at $1,999

$820 at Amazon$820 at Samsung Why we like it: While the Z Fold 7 might be Samsung's most advanced phone, the S25 Edge is arguably the runner-up, flaunting an ultra-thin form factor that gives it the benefit of having a large 6.7-inch AMOLED display and a lightweight hand feel. I've been testing the phone for a little more than a week, and it still blows my mind how this design combination exists in 2025. Picking up almost any other big-screen phone is like taking a step back in time.While the S25 Edge is the first of its kind, it features the best aspects of the standard Galaxy S25 models, including the tried-and-tested 200MP main camera of the Ultra, the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset with 12GB of RAM, and a display that gets brighter than most phones when outdoors. Based on my review, the lack of a dedicated telephoto lens on the S25 Edge wasn't sorely missed, as the main sensor retained a good amount of detail even after digitally cropping.Review: Samsung Galaxy S25 EdgeWho it's for: Tech enthusiasts and users with delicate wrists (myself included) will benefit from the ultra-thin design of the S25 Edge. It really is one of those phones you have to see and hold to truly grasp its extraordinance. And once you use it, every other device will feel like a brick in your hand.You'll also have to be willing to splurge a bit, as the S25 Edge starts at $1,099 for the 256GB variant. That puts it right in between the S25 Plus ($999) and S25 Ultra ($1,299), both of which field larger batteries and more cameras. Should you find a competitive trade-in offer at a retailer or carrier store, then the S25 Edge and its unique design may be worth considering.Who should look elsewhere: While the price of the S25 Edge is one barrier to entry, I'd put it after the most significant caveat, which is battery life.

Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge Best lightweight Samsung phone

Why we like it: While the Z Fold 7 might be Samsung's most advanced phone, the S25 Edge is arguably the runner-up, flaunting an ultra-thin form factor that gives it the benefit of having a large 6.7-inch AMOLED display and a lightweight hand feel. I've been testing the phone for a little more than a week, and it still blows my mind how this design combination exists in 2025. Picking up almost any other big-screen phone is like taking a step back in time.While the S25 Edge is the first of its kind, it features the best aspects of the standard Galaxy S25 models, including the tried-and-tested 200MP main camera of the Ultra, the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset with 12GB of RAM, and a display that gets brighter than most phones when outdoors. Based on my review, the lack of a dedicated telephoto lens on the S25 Edge wasn't sorely missed, as the main sensor retained a good amount of detail even after digitally cropping.Review: Samsung Galaxy S25 EdgeWho it's for: Tech enthusiasts and users with delicate wrists (myself included) will benefit from the ultra-thin design of the S25 Edge. It really is one of those phones you have to see and hold to truly grasp its extraordinance. And once you use it, every other device will feel like a brick in your hand.You'll also have to be willing to splurge a bit, as the S25 Edge starts at $1,099 for the 256GB variant. That puts it right in between the S25 Plus ($999) and S25 Ultra ($1,299), both of which field larger batteries and more cameras. Should you find a competitive trade-in offer at a retailer or carrier store, then the S25 Edge and its unique design may be worth considering.Who should look elsewhere: While the price of the S25 Edge is one barrier to entry, I'd put it after the most significant caveat, which is battery life. With only a 3,900mAh capacity -- smaller than the standard Galaxy S25's 4,000mAh) -- you should expect to charge the S25 Edge by late afternoon. As a power user, I often found myself topping up the phone before the end of my work shifts, which is not the most ideal if you're a frequent traveler or don't often have a charger nearby.Therefore, if endurance is a priority for you, I'd recommend the S25 Plus (4,900mAh) or Ultra (5,000mAh) models instead.

View now at SamsungView now at AmazonView now at Best Buy Why we like it: For those prioritizing excellent value -- getting the most "bang for your buck" -- the Galaxy A36 5G presents a compelling case, potentially steering buyers away from the pricier S and Z series. There are three standout reasons why this device arguably surpasses other sub-$400 options: it boasts a fantastic 6.7-inch AMOLED display that smoothly ramps up to a 120Hz refresh rate, features a versatile triple-camera system headlined by a 50MP main sensor, and includes a 5,000mAh battery that lasted me well into the night.With the A36 5G, Samsung focused on the features users value most at this price point. Compared older A-series devices, this model offers tangible upgrades like a more premium glass backing, a higher-performing Qualcomm Snapdragon chipset with 8GB of RAM, and enhancements to the camera system. Crucially, its inclusion in Samsung's five-year software and security update commitment offers longevity rarely matched by competitors in this price bracket.Review: Samsung Galaxy A36 5GWho it's for: The Galaxy A36 5G is primarily targeted toward value-conscious consumers seeking a highly capable smartphone under the $400 mark. Its combination of a high-quality 120Hz AMOLED screen, a respectable 50MP main camera, and a large 5,000mAh battery addresses the core features many users look for in a reliable daily driver. I recommend the Samsung phone to most people who want a little more power and performance than traditional budget handsets.The A36 5G is also an excellent choice for individuals who value long-term usability and security. The five-year update commitment provides peace of mind and considerably extends the device's lifespan compared to rivals like Motorola and OnePlus.Who should look elsewhere: While the A36 5G excels in value, it may not satisfy users seeking specific niche features or aesthetics found in some competitors.

Why choose a Samsung as your smartphone of choice?
While previous comparisons have placed Apple ahead of Samsung regarding the overall phone experience, Samsung is arguably the best option in 2025. One reason is the variety of models across different price points, from the A-series that encapsulates the sub-$500 market to the S-series for premium shoppers. Having tested the latest handsets from both brands (and others), I find that the Samsung Galaxy continues to offer the most features and capabilities at relatively competitive prices.When compared to the Google Pixel lineup specifically, Samsung wins out by having a more robust software experience, with greater customizability for users to modify settings, home screen setups, app behaviors, and more. Historically, Google has leaned on Samsung to debut the latest software features, such as Circle to Search and enhanced Gemini, so you can count on Galaxy phones to field more innovative capabilities sooner.Overall, the popularity of Samsung is a key asset to the brand, as there's a greater variety of cases and accessories, as well as more certified repair technicians for after-sales support.

Factors to consider when choosing a Samsung phone
ZDNET writers like myself spent months testing every phone in this best list while also sourcing opinions and recommendations from industry experts and analysts who have also tested the devices. Here are the key factors that we look for when curating the top picks.Design: Unlike how we would compare the best Android phones, comparing Samsung phones across different price points mostly boils down to the hardware. How a phone is designed, what materials the manufacturer chooses, and whether the device can take a hit or two are considered when picking the very best.Cameras: The camera systems on Samsung phones have gotten superb over the past few years, so much so that you're well off even if you opt for a mid-ranger like the Galaxy A36 5G.Special features: If there's one thing that differentiates most Samsung phones from other manufacturers, it's unique features. From the S25 Ultra with its built-in stylus and 200MP camera to the foldable screens of the Z Fold and Z Flip, you'll feel a sense of wonderment when using something that's built differently. Availability: Samsung has a reputation for bringing the wildest phones to the press, even if they're not readily available. That's why every pick on this list can be purchased at the time of writing, whether that's on Samsung's website or at a local carrier store.

How we test Samsung phones
ZDNET's review team spends upwards of a year testing the ins and outs of every Samsung model, evaluating the day-to-day performance, camera quality, battery life and endurance, and more. Here's a breakdown of every factor we consider before we make recommendations:Design and ergonomics: How good a phone looks and feels plays a big role in many users' buying journeys, so we consider these aspects heavily when testing.Performance: Several factors affect a phone's performance, including LTE/5G signal, battery life, and background tasks. Therefore, we typically begin our evaluations with a fully charged handset, all background tasks closed, and the most stable mobile connection possible.Camera quality: ZDNET tests phone cameras by capturing hundreds of photos and videos of various subjects and in various lighting conditions. We also compare the output to that of older models.Battery life and charging: It's also important for us to evaluate how long phones last under light, moderate, and heavy usage, how long they take to recharge, and how they do it (wired, wireless, or both).Special features: These features distinguish tested devices from a bustling smartphone market and hopefully bring added value to users, not the opposite.Pricing and availability: Beyond budget considerations, we also note if a phone is available in the US or only internationally.For a more extensive breakdown, check out our comprehensive phone testing methodology page.

Latest news on Samsung phonesThe latest event for Samsung was July Unpacked, where it announced the Galaxy Z Flip 7 and Z Fold 7 devices to the public. Now, all eyes are on its rumored tri-foldable phone, which the company first teased back in January, when it suggested that there were several untapped form factors the company was exploring.More recently, Samsung's Head of Mobile Experience, TM Roh, told The Korea Times that the company is gearing up to launch a tri-foldable phone by the end of the year. If true, we may see an upcoming foldable phone that bends in two ways, with a display that surpasses even the Z Fold 7 in ingenuity.While Samsung wouldn't be the first to do it -- the Huawei Mate XT Ultimate gets that honor -- it could be the first to launch a phone of such nature in the broader international market, including the US.Kerry Wan's smartphone adviceI've used dozens of smartphones in the past year alone, learning the ins and outs -- the tips and tricks -- to make the most out of my handset. Here are my three biggest pointers on taking care of your smartphone in 2025:Speeding up your smartphoneSomething I always do when setting up a new Android phone is dialing up animation and transition speeds. You can do this by turning on Developer Options, a backend catalog of system settings meant for developers to access (rules were meant to be broken, right?). To turn on Developer Options, go into your About Phone page in the settings and look for the Build Number. Tap on that seven times, and you should see a pop-up indicating that Developer Options has been turned on. Now, the activated tab will appear in the main settings list. From there, scroll down until you find Windows, Transition, and Animator duration scale. Tap into each and switch from 1x (default) to 0.5x to double the speed of your phone's animations.Optimizing your battery healthTo preserve your phone's battery life, it's best to charge it between 20% and 80% and never let it drop to 0% or charge fully to 100%. This is because the heat generated from overcharging the phone can burn (or degrade) the battery, reducing its number of charge cycles. This phenomenon is the reason why you shouldn't charge your phone overnight or leave it plugged in for an extended period of time.When in doubt, after a year or two of usage, consider getting your phone's battery swapped to refresh its charge cycles. You'll be amazed at how well it functions again.How to keep your phone cleanUnless you're invested in a repairs and warranty plan like Samsung Care, consider suiting your phone with a protective case and/or tempered glass screen protector. Beyond drop protection, the two accessories will prevent the phone from getting scratches, scuffs, and other blemishes and can greatly reduce the chance of water damage. For what it's worth, if a manufacturer claims its phone is rated IP68, that means the device can withstand dust ingress and be submerged in water for up to 30 minutes at 1 meter.Also: Best satellite phones: Models tested from SpaceX, Garmin, & MoreFAQ on smartphones in 2025
