High blood pressure, or hypertension, affects an estimated 1.3 billion people worldwide, according to the World Heart Federation, and it's the number one risk factor for death on a global scale. There are effective means to treat high blood pressure, but it's not always easy to detect and monitor. Blood pressure watches offer a convenient, non-invasive way to keep track of your cardiovascular health on the go so you can consult with your healthcare provider. YHE offers a very accurate assortment of blood pressure watches starting at just $129, while the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra is at the high end with a price of $425. Whether you're managing hypertension, staying proactive about your wellness, or simply curious about your vital stats, these innovative smartwatches combine style, functionality, and accuracy. Also: Best Android smartwatches: Expert testedWhat is the best blood pressure watch you can buy right now? To help you find the top smartwatch that functions as a blood pressure monitoring tool, we found studies from doctors evaluating the best commercially available blood pressure watches, keeping in mind accuracy, data privacy, and price. We also tested a few of the watches and compared the watch readings to blood pressure cuffs mounted on the arm. The best blood pressure that you can purchase for the US market is the YHE BP Doctor Fit, which is one of the few wearables available that captures your blood pressure using an inflatable cuff around the wrist.

View now at YHE Why we like it: The YHE BP Doctor Fit promises medical-grade accuracy in measuring blood pressure, and after testing it for a few weeks, we can confirm that is a valid promise.

The Galaxy Watch 7 measures blood pressure and, using the watch's built-in health monitor app, takes ECG readings as well. However, Samsung does
that the blood pressure function "cannot diagnose hypertension, other conditions, or check for signs of a heart attack. It is not meant to replace traditional methods of diagnosis or treatment by a qualified healthcare professional."Review: Google Pixel Watch 3 vs. Samsung Galaxy Watch 7: Which Android smartwatch is best for you?Who it's for: The watch is packed with other features, including sleep tracking and music streaming, and it also made ZDNET's list of the best smartwatches.

conducted with the Galaxy Watch showed that taking blood pressure measurements with the watch resulted in reliable and accurate readings. The watch was used to help monitor BP in patients with Parkinson's Disease.The blood pressure function has not yet received FDA approval in the US, but it is available in at least 50 other countries, including Canada, Vietnam, and South Africa. (If you are in the US and still want to use the feature without FDA clearance, you can find unofficial workarounds online to do so.) To ensure accurate readings, users must calibrate their watches monthly with a traditional blood pressure cuff. Who should look elsewhere: If you are in the US and do not want to "hack" your watch to enable blood pressure support, then the Galaxy Watch 7 is not going to help you monitor your blood pressure.

View now at Med-watch Why we like it: For those who want a blood pressure watch without having to connect your data to a smartphone or an app, the Med-Watch Pro is a great option. It houses all your health data in the device itself. If you do want to connect it to your smartphone, the DaFit app provides more helpful insights and personal recommendations based on your data. Who it's for: The Med-Watch Pro measures your blood pressure using an optical sensor to detect blood flow beneath the skin. More specifically, a technique called photoplethysmography (PPG) allows the watch to emit light into the skin and measure changes in light absorption to calculate blood pressure. It takes only 30 seconds or less to get a blood pressure reading. In addition to blood pressure, the Med-Watch Pro measures heart rate, blood oxygen levels, sleep patterns, daily steps, and more for overall health tracking. Who should look elsewhere: If you have high blood pressure and want to monitor trends, you should consider spending about the same to buy an accurate and proven model like the YHE BP Doctor Fit rather than purchasing one using less accurate technology.Med-Watch Pro tech specs: BP measurement: Optical sensors | Size: Adjustable strap (5.5-8.5 inches) | Weight: N/A | Power source: Rechargeable battery | Battery life: Up to a week | App: DaFit app

Factors to consider when choosing a blood pressure watch
There are not as many options today for blood pressure watches as there are for smartwatches, but rumors indicate that the technology and functionality will likely expand to more popular smartwatches in the near future. Here are a few factors to consider, based on our years of experience testing wearables:Capability: The Samsung Galaxy Watch 7, and other supported Galaxy Watch models, require that you measure and baseline your blood pressure readings with a certified external monitor and enter that data into the app. The watch then measures the incremental changes from that baseline and provides your blood pressure reading. Other watches in this list use an inflatable cuff to measure your blood pressure directly.Other functions: The Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 and Ultra are full-blown smartwatches that run Google's Wear OS, but other watches in this list focus primarily on capturing your blood pressure and providing you with the time and data. Make sure you check out the functions available in the watch and evaluate whether or not you need more from your blood pressure watch.Fit and comfort: Anyone that has captured their blood pressure reading knows that placement of the blood pressure monitor is important in capturing accurate readings. Thus, the watch you use for your blood pressure should also fit well and be comfortable as you capture your readings. A blood pressure watch is used primarily for convenience and the ability to easily capture your readings throughout the day so comfort and fit are vital to success.

How we choose these blood pressure watches
One obstacle we ran into when choosing the best blood pressure watches was the lack of options. The concept of a blood pressure watch itself seems to be embraced by many, but we found the execution to be less robust.With few options on the market, it is easy to weed out the fake or unreliable wearables from the legit ones. We took into consideration a few major factors when choosing these best blood pressure watches: Commercial availability: For example, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 and Ultra still do not have FDA approval in the United States for blood pressure readings, so that feature isn't an option for the US market.Accuracy: We looked at evidence of accuracy from studies and medical research when choosing what blood pressure watches to consider.Data privacy: Health information is extremely important to keep secure with wearables, so we looked into each brand and device's privacy protocols to ensure consumers' health data is safe.Price: We keep price in mind when making our final picks while knowing there aren't many options on the market. However, more economical wearables don't seem as reliable or as focused on data privacy.

Latest news on blood pressure watches
Samsung continues to seek FDA approval for its blood pressure monitoring capability, and hopefully someday it will be able to provide this support officially in the US. Rumors indicate that Apple may be working to provide this key functionality in a future Apple Watch. Given the prevalence of high blood pressure in the US, a major smartwatch brand could certainly benefit from providing this capability.

FAQs on blood pressure watches
Do blood pressure watches really work?
We know, a watch that measures blood pressure sounds like something out of a science fiction novel. Recent advances mean that futuristic wearables are becoming more realistic than ever before. Blood pressure watches that are vetted and tested really do work, but I recommend talking to your doctor before use.In an article featured in IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Magazine, Dr. Paolo Bonato, associate professor at Harvard Medical School, identified four areas of focus that are especially important when understanding recent advances in wearables: 1) wearable sensors; 2) wearable systems; 3) signal processing and analysis procedures; and 4) closed-loop systems for adaptive orthoses and prostheses. The first three areas are important in blood pressure monitoring, as sensors and systems feed into analysis and recommendations by doctors. Here's a comprehensive paper on wearable tech in healthcare that Dr. Bonato contributed to for those who want to learn more.

What is stroke level blood pressure?
According to Healthline, the blood pressure range for a hypertension crisis is a systolic number above 180 mm Hg and a diastolic number above 120 mm Hg. Immediate medical attention is required at that level. Healthy blood pressure is a reading of less than 120/80 mmHg, while elevated blood pressure ranges from a systolic number of 120-129 mm Hg and a diastolic number of less than 80 mmHg. Hypertension occurs starting at 130-139/80-89 mmHg. It's good to have an idea of where your blood pressure should fall. Hypertension doesn't result in visible symptoms right away, so it's important to detect and manage it early on.

Does the Apple Watch measure blood pressure?
You cannot measure blood pressure with an Apple Watch alone. You can link it to a compatible blood pressure monitor and synchronize your blood pressure data to your Apple Watch. The Omron Evolv wireless blood pressure monitor is a compatible device, and the iHealth Feel wireless blood pressure monitor works, too.

How accurate is the blood oxygen sensor on the Apple Watch?
The blood oxygen sensor in the Apple Watch measures the percentage of oxygen your red blood cells carry from your lungs to the rest of your body. It's an important health metric since it can help you better understand your overall wellness. According to a 2022 medical study, the measurement of blood oxygen levels (in an Apple Watch Series 6) was not yet up to the medical standard of pulse oximetry; too many of the measurements remain unsuccessful or incorrect. Studies have not been conducted on the most recent Apple Watch models. *Important Note: Earlier this year, a US federal judge has ruled that Apple cannot sell its Series 10 and Ultra 2 smartwatches if they have the blood oxygen sensor, due to a patent violation. As a result, a ban was placed on the import of all Apple watches with the feature. Apple Watch users in the US are no longer able to access the blood oxygen monitor app or sensors.

High blood pressure is equal to or greater than 140 over 90 mmHg, where the top number is a measure of the force in your arteries as your heart beats and pumps blood, and the bottom number is a measure of the force in your arteries as your heart is resting between beats.
