View now at Amazon Why we like it: The Titan X Trifold wallet comes with a built-in AirTag holder, internal cash and card storage, extra pockets, and a handy trigger mechanism to help dispense your most used cards. Also: Forget Ridge: I tested an AirTag wallet that's more functional (and cheaper)Unlike the Ridge wallet, you don't need to purchase the AirTag holder separately, and the Titan X is slightly cheaper than the Ridge, especially while it is on sale for $65. It's a durable daily driver and offers great value.Testing the Titan X wallet for several weeks left me quite impressed. It's even more valuable than purchasing an option like the Ridge wallet, especially if you already have an AirTag on hand to pop in it. The Titan X wallet is constructed of leather and aluminum and features a traditional trifold design. There is internal cash storage and traditional internal "pockets," which I found helpful and more secure for my ID and money. The trigger mechanism is a manicure saver.Who's it for: This wallet is for someone who needs a larger card capacity, wants something comparable to a traditional wallet, and appreciates top features like a trigger mechanism and internal pockets.Who should look elsewhere: This won't be for someone who wants a compact design or only needs minimal card storage. The Titan X also doesn't come in many colors, and the internal cash pockets are a bit cheap. Titan X AirTag Wallet specs: Type: Expandable | Material: Aluminum and leather | RFID blocking | Built-in AirTag holder | Internal pockets and cash storage | Trigger mechanism design | Dimensions: 3.9 x 2.8 x 0.7 inches

View now at Amazon The Ridge wallet is a slim RFID-blocking wallet designed to hold up to 12 cards. Cash can be stored via a cash strap or money clip on the outside of the wallet, and the brand offers three AirTag configurations for tracking: an AirTag holder designed to
or
for $25, and the
that attaches outside any Ridge wallet for $40. The Ridge offers durability and functionality while also providing top-notch security and smart capabilities. Although pricey, it has a lifetime warranty to keep up with your daily use and a risk-free 99-day trial period. All things considered, a quality, traditional leather-style wallet could easily run you over the $100 mark, too, which makes this long-term investment worth it. Why we like it: I gifted this wallet to my dad a year before I started using one myself, and I can confidently say it's a winner. Before gifting him the Ridge, he used several other wallets, including a traditional leather and titanium case style, but none fit his needs. The wallet's practicality, coupled with the RFID technology, numerous color and metal options, and the addable AirTag tracker, make the Ridge nearly faultless. Although it can get a little chunky when it's full to the brim with cards, this is a great wallet for small handbags, concert or stadium bags, and going out on the town. Who's it for: If you're looking for a large capacity, durable, and functional wallet, this may be for you. It has an AirTag attachment, and many additive accessories like cash straps or clips. It is a tad pricey, but it's certainly a long-term investment and has stood the test of time. My dad has had his several years now. Who should look elsewhere: If you'd prefer a more traditional style wallet, this may not be for you. It has an industrial look, even though the color options and designs have greatly expanded. It's also a bit difficult to work with if you keep longer fingernails and geared more towards heavy card carriers. Ridge Wallet specs: Type: Expandable | Material: Aluminum | RFID blocking | Accessories and add-ons available | Several materials and designs | Cash strap or money clip for cash storage | Dimensions: 86 x 54 x 6 mm
Pros
Durable
RFID-blocking
Relatively slim yet multi-functional
Minimalist design
Unique colors and designs
Cons
Expensive
Must buy AirTag holder components as add-ons
Can become bulky for pockets when full

View now at Bosca Why we like it: What makes Bosca's stand-out is the craftsmanship and leather used to construct it. Upon opening this wallet, I knew right away that it was what the kids call legit. The leather is smooth, and the Saddle color has a striking and elevated tone. It looks like something that didn't fall out of Amazon's massive factory market, thanks to the full grain, Italian, hand-stained leather, and intentional construction. Who's it for: Someone who wants a sleek, card holder accessory that feels luxury. It holds cards well, has a dedicated ID slot with a slit to make grabbing your identification easy, and has two pockets to carry extra cash, cards, or other incidentals. It's super easy to snap your AirTag in and be on your way, and most importantly, it's the kind of tech accessory that feels like it will withstand the test of time, perhaps even getting better with age. I compared the leather of this wallet to some of my personal handbags and small goods from various other brands, and there's a similar quality standard.Who should look elsewhere: There's a few reasons you may want to skip out on this. It is pricier than other options on this list, though not as expensive as a Ridge wallet. I wish there were more color options, but for what is offered this wallet is a confident balance of affordable luxury that justifies its price tag. It could also prevent the type of incessant rebuying that can often occur with tech accessories. Bosca AirTag Wallet features: Type: Hybrid cardholder design | Dimensions: 4.375 H x 3.00 W x 0.125 D | Card capacity: 3 card pockets, 2 card/cash pockets, 1 ID slot | Cash storage | Full grain, Italian, Hand-stained leather
Pros
Quality leather
Minimalist design
Secure AirTag holder
ID slot
Affordable luxury
Cons

Not ideal for over 5 cards

Factors to consider when choosing an AirTag wallet
If you're in the market for an AirTag wallet, you already know the marketplace is extensive. Here are a few things to keep in mind while you search that may help you narrow down your options and find the right fit for you. Capacity: Consider what you want to store in your wallet. How many cards? Cash? Are there any other incidentals like your work badge or transit passes? We'd recommend finding out your absolute bare minimum need for card capacity and factoring that into your search. You'll easily be able to cut a huge chunk of options out based on capacity alone. Security: Many AirTag wallets provide RFID-blocking, which means that they block card scanners that can steal your information. If this is a top priority for you, you can drop many of the cheaper options, which often don't offer these capabilities. Cost: The price of AirTag wallets can vary considerably, and like with any purchase, establishing a budget is key. While we've included a budget, midrange, and expensive pick on this list, you need to decide for yourself what your magic number is. Keep in mind that your wallet is often an everyday essential that lasts for a number of years, so it may be worth it to set a higher budget. Plus, many quality traditional leather wallets also cost over $100. Your needs: You're here because you think you want an AirTag wallet.

What does RFID mean?
According to the Department of Homeland Security, RFID refers to Radio Frequency Identification technology. This technology uses radio waves to identify people or objects. There are devices that can read information contained in a wireless device or "tag" from a distance without making any physical contact or requiring a line of sight like credit or debit card chips.
