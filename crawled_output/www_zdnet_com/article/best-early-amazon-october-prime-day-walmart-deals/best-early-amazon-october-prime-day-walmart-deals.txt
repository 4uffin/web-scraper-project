When is October Prime Day 2025? This year, Amazon's October Prime Day sale runs from October 7 to 8. The annual sale will last for two days in the fall, and you can expect to see a range of deals on household goods and electronics. Are Walmart products really cheaper on Prime Day? They can be! Ever since Black Friday first launched, online retailers have jumped on Amazon sales events to launch their own 'anti-' sales events. If consumers are in the mood to shop, then retailers want a slice of the pie. As a result, expect to see sales, discounts, and flash deals from retailers, potentially including Walmart and Best Buy.How did we choose these October Prime Day deals?ZDNET authors only write about deals that interest us personally and include products that we own, have tested, or want to buy. Our experts looked for deals that were at least 20% off (or are hardly ever on sale, as is often the case with Apple devices), using established price comparison tools and trackers to determine whether the deal actually represents value for your money. We also considered customer reviews to find out what matters to real people who already own and use the deals we're recommending. Our recommendations may also be based on our own testing -- in addition to extensive research and comparison shopping. The goal is to deliver the most accurate advice to help you shop smarter during limited-time events.
