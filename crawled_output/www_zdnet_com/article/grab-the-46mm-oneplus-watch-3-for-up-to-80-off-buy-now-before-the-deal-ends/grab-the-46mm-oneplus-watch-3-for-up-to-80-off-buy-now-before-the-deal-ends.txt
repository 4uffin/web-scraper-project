3/5 Editor's deal rating $220 at OnePlus OnePlus continues to hold its Back to College sales event, so you can still score some big discounts on the latest tech. For a limited time, the 43mm OnePlus Watch 3 is on sale for $270, a $30 discount. The wearable is available in two colors: Silver Steel and Black Steel. While $30 is a decent discount, it is possible to save even more money through OnePlus' trade-in program. According to the company, you can trade in any device in any condition and get an extra $50 off, dropping the smartwatch's price further to $220.More OnePlus deals: OnePlus 12 | OnePlus 13 | OnePlus Pad 3 | OnePlus Buds Pro 3If you want a bigger screen, the 46mm OnePlus Watch 3 is on sale for $320, which is also a $30 discount. I suggest taking advantage of the trade-in program, so you can drop the price down to $270. And this wearable is available in two unique colors: Obsidian Titanium and Emerald Titanium.

Buy the 43mm OnePlus Watch 3 for $220 (save $80)
$220 at OnePlus The OnePlus Watch 3 is the brand's latest flagship wearable, combining a sleek, durable design with a lengthy battery life. According to ZDNET contributing writer Matthew Miller, the device can last up to five days on a single charge, which, as he points out, is something that many Apple Watch and Pixel Watch models do not offer.Also: I tried every new Apple Watch released in 2025 - here's why the Ultra 3 deserves your attentionIt sports a bright 1.5-inch AMOLED display made of sapphire crystal glass, a notably hard material made to resist scratches. The OnePlus Watch 3's fitness tracking is robust, with over 100 sport modes and deep post-workout analytics that display heart rate, running power, and more.How I rated this dealMy rating of this deal depends on which discount is chosen. I give the base $30-off promo a 2/5 as per ZDNET's rating system. But if you take advantage of the trade-in program, the rating jumps up to a 3/5. $80 off is roughly a 25% discount, which is a significant amount. I strongly suggest taking advantage of this sales event. The OnePlus Watch 3 is a solid alternative to other flagship wearables like Samsung's Galaxy Watch 8 and Pixel Watch 4.
