Jason Hiner/ZDNETFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.Apple pulled back the curtain on its latest product lineup during its "Awe Dropping" keynote in Cupertino this week. The hour-long event revealed a host of new products, including the iPhone 17 series, Apple Watch Series 11, Apple Watch Ultra 3, and AirPods Pro 3. ZDNET was on-site to cover the announcements, and we've compiled a summary of the biggest news from the event. We'll continue to provide updates as we get them.What major products were announced?iPhone 17 series: Apple kicked things off with the standard iPhone 17 for $799, which now features a 120Hz ProMotion display, an enhanced front-facing camera for flexible recording, and an A19 chipset. The showstealer, however, was arguably the new $999 iPhone Air model, Apple's thinnest and lightest phone to date. According to Apple, it runs on a more powerful A19 Pro chip, has only one camera sensor due to its limited size, and is durably built. Also: iPhone 17 Pro vs. iPhone 16 Pro: How to choose The Pro and Pro Max models -- which start at $1,099 and $1,199, respectively -- also got a redesigned back cover, with a larger camera visor that houses an enhanced telephoto sensor. A new vapor chamber cooling system keeps the phones running at peak performance for longer, while prolonging the battery life.Apple Watch Series 11: Apple highlighted how the $399 Apple Watch is an essential piece of personal health and safety technology by sharing real-world, life-saving testimonials. The upcoming Apple Watch Series 11 will be the thinnest and most comfortable watch yet, featuring 5G connectivity, new watch faces, and an extremely scratch-resistant ceramic design.Apple Watch Ultra 3: The $799 Apple Watch Ultra 3 features a brighter, wider-angle OLED display with thinner bezels, allowing for a larger screen. It will be the first Apple Watch to offer satellite connectivity for emergency messaging and location syncing, along with 5G support. The Ultra 3 is also rated for the longest battery life of any Apple Watch, lasting up to 42 hours on a single charge.Also: Excited about Apple Watch 11's hypertension feature? It's coming to older models tooApple Watch SE 3: The third-generation $249 Apple Watch SE runs on an S10 chip and now includes a new always-on display. This model also introduces fast charging for the first time, giving users up to eight hours of battery life with just a 15-minute charge. It maintains an 18-hour overall battery life and is compatible with iOS 26, which unlocks advanced features. AirPods Pro 3: The event began with the launch of the $249 AirPods Pro 3, which feature a multi-port acoustic architecture for improved sound quality on both music and calls. The new earbuds have twice the active noise cancellation of previous models and a battery life of up to eight hours with ANC on, a four-hour increase. They will also support Live Translation powered by Apple Intelligence and come with new ear tips in five sizes for a better fit.Also: You can preorder Apple's new devices this week: iPhone 17, Watch 11, AirPods Pro 3 and moreFor more on-site coverage of Apple's iPhone 17 event, check out our sibling sites' live blogs at CNET, PCMag, Mashable, and Lifehacker.Best iPhone 17 preorder deals right nowHere are the best deals we've found so far, from carrier offers to retailer promotions.

Apple's Hypertension Detection receives FDA clearance
Nina Raemont/ZDNET
By Nina Raemont, Wearables Editor at Sept. 12, 7:53 a.m. ETApple unveiled Hypertension Detection at its Tuesday event, where it announced that the feature would receive FDA clearance by the end of the month. Well, the FDA clearance came sooner than expected. The Apple Watch feature received clearance Thursday night, and users can expect to see the feature arrive on their smartwatches starting next week. Hypertension Detection is available on Apple Watch Series 9 or later and Ultra 2 or later. It skips the SE smartwatch model. This is the third health feature Apple has received FDA clearance for, with the others including hearing loss detection and sleep apnea detection. It now has more FDA-cleared features than Samsung and Google.

Jason Hiner/ZDNET
By Kerry Wan, Managing Editor / Sept. 11 at 4:55 p.m. ETZDNET got a chance to test out the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max cameras while at Apple Park this week, and early samples are looking good so far.My colleague Jason Hiner captured the image above with the new 48MP telephoto sensor at 8x optical zoom. For how bright the Cupertino office can be, there's surprisingly no harsh glare or overexposed areas.

The first Apple-approved iPhone Air bend test results are in...
Jason Hiner/ZDNET
By Kerry Wan, Managing Editor / Sept. 11 at 4:42 p.m. ETand...it survived!In a recent interview with Apple's senior leadership, Tom's Guide editor-in-chief Mark Spoonauer was permitted to forcefully bend the iPhone Air. The device, reinforced with a titanium band similar to the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge, showed a slight flex but quickly returned to its original shape.The new design keeps the phone lightweight and sturdy. While the iPhone Air appears to have avoided a "bendgate" repeat, its true durability will be seen when it's in consumers' hands.

The iPhone's new Dual Capture mode is perfect for concerts
By Kerry Wan, Managing Editor / Sept. 10 at 7:19 p.m. ETOne of the best new camera features on the iPhone 17 series lets you capture with the rear and front cameras simultaneously. It's a vlogging feature I've seen on competing Android phones, and I can see a lot of people using it when recording live performances and concerts. After all, the reactions to those moments are just as valuable as what's in front of the camera.Check out Jason Hiner's test footage below.

AirPods Pro 3 will ship without a charging cable
Jason Hiner/ZDNET
By Kerry Wan, Managing Editor / Sept. 10 at 2:40 p.m. ETAccording to Apple's technical specs page for the new AirPods Pro 3, the wireless earbuds will ship without a charging cable in the box. This means users will have to use an existing USB-C cable or wireless charging dock to power the accessories.At this point in time, are we more forgiving of these omissions? I personally stash away most of my new USB-C cables, as one or two are enough to power my primary devices. But if you're upgrading from the original AirPods Pro, expect to have to buy a charger to go with it.

The carrier deals are starting to appear, and they're aggressive
By Kerry Wan, Managing Editor / Sept. 10 at 1:29 p.m. ETAhead of Friday's preorder window, I'm seeing several carrier promotions starting to surface, including this latest one from Verizon. It slashes off $1,100 -- equal to the cost of an iPhone 17 Pro at retail price -- when you trade in an eligible smartphone and are on an Unlimited data plan.This is par for the course when it comes to carrier deals, as AT&T and T-Mobile are running similar packages. As always, you should read the fine print when accepting carrier deals, as the smallest of errors can accrue fees and other expenses.

The first iPhone Pro price hike since 2017
By Kerry Wan, Managing Editor / Sept. 10 at 9:42 a.m. ETWe've been speculating all year whether or not Apple would increase the prices of iPhones, and it did! But also, not really.The $999 iPhone Air has replaced the $899 iPhone 16 Plus, but I wouldn't consider the Air a direct successor to the latter -- it's a totally different concept of a phone, with an innovation tax to go with.The $1,099 iPhone 17 Pro costs $100 more than its predecessor but now comes with 256GB of base storage instead of 128GB. Apple has essentially removed the 128GB configuration this year. That's all.

Apple Watch SE 3 is the underdog of the smartwatch lineup
Nina Raemont/ZDNET
By Nina Raemont, Wearables Editor at Sept. 9, 9:34 p.m. ETThe Apple Watch SE 3 is the underdog that few expected Apple to announce at its annual hardware launch. It doesn't have the advanced hardware that its siblings boast - Apple includes the S10 chip it developed for 2024's Series 10 smartwatch lineup. It lacks some of the hotter features the Apple Watch Series 11 or Apple Watch Ultra 3 pack, like Hypertension Detection or Satellite Connectivity. But it's shaping up to be a good value for smartwatch curious consumers. I look forward to testing the watch out to find out for myself.

The biggest features you'll gain from upgrading your iPhone
By Kerry Wan, Managing Editor / Sept. 9 at 8:20 p.m. ETEvery year, when a new iPhone launches, I get asked, "Should I upgrade from my current phone?" And every year, I answer by asking if the latest features make a dramatic difference to how they use their phone.Here are the biggest new features you'll get by upgrading to the iPhone 17 series compared to previous generations.From iPhone 16 series: A better selfie camera that can auto-frame the subject, a 120Hz display on the base model, improved thermal cooling (Pro only), and a sharper telephoto lens (Pro only).From iPhone 15 series: A Camera Control button, slimmer bezels and larger displays, faster USB-C charging speeds, and all the above.From iPhone 14 series: An Action button, USB-C charging, an aluminum-forward design (Pro only), and all the above.From iPhone 13 series: A Dynamic Island punch-hole camera, eSIM support, and all the above.

iPhone 17 Pro in Cosmic Orange is up there for best color
Nina Raemont/ZDNET
By Kerry Wan, Managing Editor / Sept. 9 at 3:42 p.m. ETThe hands-on photos I've seen so far of the iPhone 17 Pro in Cosmic Orange are giving me immense FOMO. It's so refreshing to see Apple branch out of the standard black, white, and grayish hues and be more experimental. But as always, if consumers want more of this, they'll have to vote with their wallets.By Sabrina Ortiz, Senior Editor / Sept. 9 at 4:31 p.m. ETWhile I am not an orange person and own not one ounce of orange in my wardrobe or accessories, the Cosmic Orange color is absolutely stunning. As we discussed in the office, the hands-on footage makes it evident that the color is much less of a traffic cone orange and more of a copper-like shade.

We'll be testing Sleep Scores
By Nina Raemont, Editor / Sept. 9 at 2:09 p.m. ETI've been wishing for sleep scores on the Apple Watch for a long time, and I look forward to testing out the feature on the Series 11. The feature brings a common health tracking feature to Apple's latest lineup of devices, and keeps the tech giant in competition with its wearable rivals that have already implemented the feature into their devices.

A surprising camera downgrade
By Jason Hiner, Editor in Chief / Sept. 9 at 2:07 p.m. ETAll three iPhone 17 Pro cameras are now 48MP and Fusion cameras, meaning they have multiple effective lengths. So the zoom camera is now 4x with an 8x "optical-quality" zoom. That means Apple has actually downgraded the optical zoom from 5x to 4x. I'm not sure how I feel about that, but I'll withhold judgement until I try it.That said, Apple noted it used the iPhone 17 Pro to film the launch event, due to its advanced video capabilities. The iPhone 17 Pro supports the highly anticipated ProRes RAW capture and Genlock.

iPhone 17 Pro, in just 3 colors
Apple/ZDNET
By Kerry Wan, Managing Editor / Sept. 9 at 2:00 p.m. ETFinally, the iPhone 17 Pro is here. This time, it's made with aluminum instead of titanium for a lighter yet more durable build. The phone features "the biggest battery in an iPhone," Apple says, runs on the same A19 Pro chip as the iPhone Air, and features an improved thermal cooling system that spreads throughout the phone body.Water is sealed within the vapor chamber to dissipate heat and sustain performance (a 40% improvement from the iPhone 16 Pro). In other words, the iPhone will run at peak levels for longer while retaining more battery life over time.On the front, a new anti-reflective coating should improve the screen's viewing angles, especially when outdoors. All three cameras are 48MP fusion sensors, meaning they can flex between various zoom ranges. The telephoto sensor, in particular, can capture at 8X optical quality, thanks in part to the tetraprism design.iPhone 17 Pro models will also feature the same Center Stage Front Camera as the iPhone 17. The anodized aluminum appears to be a unibody design, with curves that blend into every little corner of the iPhone. On the back is a Ceramic Shield layering that's more durable than previous generations. The iPhone 17 Pro will launch in only three colors: Silver, Cosmic Orange, and Deep Blue. Apple used Ceramic Shield on the back of the 17 Pro, just like the Air. It's 4x more resistant to cracks while being thinner overall, offering more room for the battery, which is the best (and biggest) in any iPhone.

The return of the bumper case
By Jason Hiner, Editor in Chief / Sept. 9 at 1:57 p.m. ETI always loved the bumper cases on the iPhones -- minimal, light, and great protection -- and I was seriously bummed when Apple stopped making them. No third-party case maker ever picked up the gauntlet, which was a shame. Those bumper cases also allowed the back of the phone to show through and display Apple's design. I'm thrilled that Apple is bringing back the bumper case for the iPhone Air -- perfect choice! Let's see if they bring it to the Pro models as well.

iPhone Air and eSIM
By Kerry Wan, Managing Editor / Sept. 9 at 1:54 p.m. ETApple is making a big deal about the iPhone Air's support for eSIM. In fact, it'll be the first iPhone to launch with eSIM only globally. Previously, only the US versions launched with eSIM, while other countries' iPhones supported physical SIM cards. By reducing the components within the phone, Apple says it was able to squeeze in a larger battery.Apple's decision to make the iPhone Air eSIM-only is partly logistical -- there's simply not enough room in the device to fit in a traditional SIM card next to the battery.

iPhone Air's fusion camera and battery life
By Sabrina Ortiz, Senior Editor / Sept. 9 at 1:51 p.m. ETiPhone Air has a 48MP fusion camera system that is meant to function like multiple cameras in one, including a 12MP 2X telephoto. Some other camera features include focus control, photographic styles, and custom 28MM and 52MM lenses, which add four lenses to your camera. The front features the aforementioned center stage camera at 12MP.The battery life on the iPhone Air, supported by iOS 26 features and a thoughtful under-the-hood design, supports all-day battery life, according to Apple. This includes 40 hours of video playback when using the Air's specially designed MagSafe battery pack.

Another new chip for iPhone Air
By Kerry Wan, Managing Editor / Sept. 9 at 1:48 p.m. ETThe iPhone Air will feature a new N1 chip, Apple's in-house silicon that supports Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6, and Thread. This comes just six months after Apple released the C1 modem with the iPhone 16e. The iPhone Air will also feature an upgraded C1X variant, which the company says is much more power efficient, but just as strong in network connectivity.By Jason Hiner, Editor in Chief / Sept. 9 at 1:48 p.m. ETIntegrating Apple's N1 and C1X chips into the iPhone Air and calling it the most efficient iPhone ever definitely gives this product the feeling of being the futuristic iPhone, reminiscent of the iPhone X back in 2017.

iPhone Air is here
Apple/ZDNET
By Jason Hiner, Editor in Chief / Sept. 9 at 1:45 p.m. ETThe announcement of the iPhone Air got, by far, the biggest reaction out of the crowd inside Steve Jobs Theater for the Apple Event. There's genuine enthusiasm for this product. The crowd especially hollered -- and there were even some audible gasps -- when the video came up with the iPhone Air balancing on top of a finger. I'm not sure people are going to be as excited when they learn the camera and battery life compromises, but the design itself generated plenty of strong reactions.By Kerry Wan, Managing Editor / Sept. 9 at 1:45 p.m. ETSabrina Ortiz, sitting next to me, cannot get over how thin the iPhone Air is -- 5.6mm and with a 6.5" always-on display -- and I'm expecting many consumers to feel similarly. For the first time, the phone is covered with ceramic for improved durability, making it up to five times more resistant. Impressively, the camera module is sculpted into the back cover, so it melts into the rest of the glass, reducing the size and bulk of the device. It's "a paradox you have to hold to believe," says Apple.The frame is made out of titanium for a thin design. These materials make the iPhone Air more durable than any other model. The iPhone Air features the just-announced A19 Pro chip.Apple said the phone contains "MacBook Pro-levels of compute" and that it's "the most power efficient iPhone we've ever made."

A brief AI mention
By Jason Hiner, Editor in Chief / Sept. 9 at 1:38 p.m. ETApple using AI and Center Stage to automatically frame your selfies got a huge reaction from the live audience inside the Steve Theater. There are clearly a lot of creators in this crowd. This is the first big AI feature Apple announced at the event. It's more like machine learning and not generative AI, but it's good to see Apple integrating quality-of-life features in smart ways.

Two new chips: A19 and A19 Pro
By Kerry Wan, Managing Editor / Sept. 9 at 1:46 p.m. ETThe iPhone 17 will run on an A19 chip with a 16-core Neural Engine, 5-core GPU, and improved on-device computing. The improvements to how the iPhone computes lend themselves to more gaming workloads, faster on-device AI tasks, and more. A more efficient processor also extends the iPhone 17 battery by 8 hours of video playback.Apple says the next-gen 5-core GPU is designed to support better gaming, especially paired with the display's upgraded 120Hz refresh rate.Then there's the new A19 Pro chip, which features a 6-core CPU. Apple claims it is the fastest CPU in any iPhone. It is supposed to enable battery efficiency for more everyday tasks. The 5-core GPU also got a performance boost, which makes it best for AI compute. There is a neural accelerator built into each GPU core, ideal for GPU-intensive AI workloads.The A19 Pro generates heat, Apple admits -- requiring an all-new cooling system to account for it.

iPhone 17 gets an upgraded selfie cam
By Kerry Wan, Managing Editor / Sept. 9 at 1:42 p.m. ETThe iPhone 17 will feature a 48MP main camera (that captures at 24MP binned, by default). It's still a 2x optical zoom -- nothing more -- but I've always found the base iPhone camera good enough for zoom shots. Apple has also upgraded the selfie camera, calling it the "Center Stage Front Camera," with a wider field of view and a larger sensor than last year. Capturing a wider area allows users to reframe their shots, such as swapping from landscape and portrait mode without needing to rotate the phone. Allowing you to hold the phone vertically keeps your eyes more naturally focused on the lens.By  Jason Hiner, Editor in Chief / Sept. 9 at 1:38 p.m. ETApple using AI and Center Stage to automatically frame your selfies got a huge reaction from the live audience inside the Steve Theater.

iPhone 17 finally gets 120Hz
By Jason Hiner, Editor in Chief / Sept. 9 at 1:40 p.m. ETThe introduction of a 120Hz ProMotion display in the iPhone 17 got a big reaction from the live audience inside Steve Jobs Theater. This has been long overdue. Far cheaper competitive phones have featured 90Hz and 120Hz screens for years while the standard iPhone has been stuck on 60Hz, which was just not as nice to look at every day. The 120Hz screen makes the base-level iPhone 17 a lot more competitive.

The wrist temperature tracking on Apple Watch is not easy to access and can be inaccurate. Adding temperature to AirPods Pro 3 would have given Apple's health ecosystem a better opportunity to compete with smart rings like Oura on this metric, so it's a missed opportunity.

A 48MP telephoto camera upgrade for the Pro?
Sabrina Ortiz/ZDNET
By Kerry Wan, Managing Editor / Sept. 9 at 8:37 a.m. ETWhile I no longer expect Apple to make major shifts to the iPhone Pro's camera system -- it's a law of diminishing returns kind of thing -- the rumored 48MP telephoto sensor does put a smile on my face. The improved optics should greatly benefit photographers and videographers wanting to capture at farther distances, with the potential of 8x optical zoom (versus digital) paving the way for crisper and more realistic shots.If Apple nails the telephoto camera, the iPhone 17 Pro may compete well with the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra and Google Pixel 10 Pro, both of which have proven to be reliable long-distance shooters.

This potentially positions the Air model as both the best big iPhone that doesn't cost as much as the Pro Max and the most portable for those who want that.Zoom out a bit, and you might even be looking at the beginnings of what an iPhone Fold experience could be like in a year or two.

I have some theories about the iPhone 17 event invitation...

My three theories for what the design implies are...iPhone 17 Pro colors: Expected to consist of Orange, Black, Silver, and Dark BlueA vapor chamber for cooling: This year's Apple event invitation also resembles a heat map -- reds and oranges hint at warmth, while the cooler blues suggest temperature regulation. That could be a subtle nod to upcoming thermal improvements.Other temperature features: We may potentially see body temperature and blood pressure monitoring across new AirPods and Apple Watches.
