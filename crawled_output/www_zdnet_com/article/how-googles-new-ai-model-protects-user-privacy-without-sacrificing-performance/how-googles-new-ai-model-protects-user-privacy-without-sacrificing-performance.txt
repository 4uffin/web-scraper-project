However, at the same time, you run the risk of including sensitive personal information in that dataset, which the model could then republish verbatim, leading to major security compromises for the individuals affected and damaging PR scandals for the developers. How does one balance utility with privacy?Also: Does your generative AI protect your privacy? Study ranks them best to worstNew research from Google claims to have found a solution -- a framework for building LLMs that will optimize user privacy without any major degradations in the AI's performance.Last week, a team of researchers from Google Research and Google DeepMind unveiled VaultGemma, an LLM designed to generate high-quality outputs without memorizing its training data verbatim. The result: Sensitive information that makes it into the training dataset won't get republished.Digital noiseThe key ingredient behind VaultGemma is a mathematical framework known as differential privacy (DP), which is essentially digital noise that scrambles the model's ability to perfectly memorize information found in its training data. Crucially, the researchers embedded DP at the level of sequences of tokens. This means that at the most fundamental level, VaultGemma will not be able to perfectly memorize or reproduce the details on which it's been trained.Also: 4 ways I save money on my favorite AI tool subscriptions - and you can too"Informally speaking, because we provide protection at the sequence level, if information relating to any (potentially private) fact or inference occurs in a single sequence, then VaultGemma essentially does not know that fact: The response to any query will be statistically similar to the result from a model that never trained on the sequence in question," Google wrote in a blog post summarizing its findings.There was a delicate balance to strike, here: The Google researchers had to add this digital noise without catastrophically compromising the model's performance. The better an AI model is able to memorize and thus perfectly replicate its training data, the better it should perform -- at least, assuming your metric for "better" is generating human-like responses to user prompts. But if your metric is optimizing user privacy, then the memorization-only paradigm is a problem, because most of us don't want to live in a world in which huge AI models are just hoovering up carbon copies of our personal information that can then be unpredictably republished by those same models.Google's new research, then, focused on comprehensively mapping out the optimal formula for balancing compute, privacy, and model utility.Promising early resultsBuilt upon the Gemma 2 family of open models, which Google debuted in 2024, VaultGemma clocks in at just 1 billion parameters, according to the company -- a relatively paltry size compared to the largest and most powerful models on the market, some of which are reported to be built with upward of a trillion parameters.However, VaultGemma still performed across key benchmarks roughly on par with some older models, including OpenAI's GPT-2. This suggests that a compute-privacy-utility optimization framework could eventually be a viable alternative to leading proprietary models, even though it has a long way to go before it comes close to catching up.Also: How people actually use ChatGPT vs Claude - and what the differences tell us"This comparison illustrates that today's private training methods produce models with utility comparable to that of non-private models from roughly 5 years ago, highlighting the important gap our work will help the community systematically close," Google wrote in the blog post.The model weights and training methods behind VaultGemma have been published in a research paper to allow the AI community to refine private models further. The weights can also be accessed via HuggingFace and Kaggle.Artificial Intelligence
