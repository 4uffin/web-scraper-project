Apple / ZDNETFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.ZDNET's key takeawaysYou can't turn off Liquid Glass but you can tone it down.You can do this on an iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple Watch.Toning down the effect brings a more opaque look to the screens.With the latest iOS 26 updates, Apple's new Liquid Glass design brings a more translucent look to the screens of your iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple Watch. Icons, widgets, toolbars, and other elements blend into the background as if you're looking at them through glass. I like the new aesthetic. But that doesn't mean everyone will.Maybe you're not crazy about the new design and would like to turn it off. Well, you can't disable it but you can tone it down by giving your screens a more opaque appearance. Here's how to accomplish this on an iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple Watch.
1. Reduce the Liquid Glass effect on an iPhone
On an iPhone with iOS 26, head to Settings, select Accessibility, and then tap the setting for Display & Text Size. Turn on the switch for Reduce Transparency. Return to your home screen and you'll see that the icons and folders now have a more opaque look to them.

2. Reduce the Liquid Glass effect on an iPad
The process is the same on an iPad with iPadOS 26. Head to Settings and select Accessibility. Go to the Display & Text Size screen and enable the switch for Reduce Transparency. Again, check out any Home screen with icons and folders to see if you're happier with the less transluscent look.

3. Reduce the Liquid Glass effect on a Mac
On a Mac with MacOS 26 Tahoe, head to System Settings and select Accessibility. In the Vision section, tap the setting for Display and then turn on the switch for Reduce Transparency. Open a window to see how the folders and icons now appear.

3. Reduce the Liquid Glass effect on an Apple Watch
On an Apple Watch with WatchOS 26, the steps are similar. Open the Settings app on your watch, select Accessibility, and then turn on the switch for Reduce Transparency. To see how reducing transparency affects the appearance, swipe down the screen to view your latest notifications. You'll notice that the notification panels no longer look transparent.

Screenshot by Lance Whitney/ZDNETThe Liquid Glass effect may grow on you after a while. So you might want to keep it turned on initially. But if you decide you really can't live with it, at least you know how to tone it down, if not turn it off.FAQ
Can you customize the look and color of Liquid Glass?Yes. You can change how Liquid Glass looks on your home screen -- simply by customizing your app icons and widgets. You can make them translucent ("clear"), tint them with color, switch between light and dark modes, change icon size, etc.
Elyse Betters Picaro / ZDNETHow to do it:Go to the Home Screen.Touch and hold any empty space on the Home Screen until the app icons begin to jiggle.Tap Edit at the top of the screen, then select Customize.In the menu that pops up, you can choose between Default, Dark, Clear, and Tinted themes. From there, you can further set Light, Dark, or Auto modes (Auto adapts based on whether your phone is in light or dark mode). You'll also see an option to make things brighter (sun icon), and you can even make your app icons larger or smaller now (boxes icon). This feature is available in iOS and iPadOS. You can also customize Liquid Glass on Mac.Want to follow my work? Add ZDNET as a trusted source on Google.
