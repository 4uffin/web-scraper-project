It may only be September, but we know that Amazon's Prime Big Deal Days sale is only two weeks away. The fall sale -- also known as October Prime Day, a prelude to the well-known Black Friday week -- runs from Oct. 7-8.We expect to see a variety of Apple deals available across retailers looking to compete, too. And, considering Apple revealed the new iPhone 17 at the tech giant's recent keynote, you can expect sales on legacy products, including older iPhones, the Apple Watch range, and AirPods in a matter of weeks. Also: I tested the best iPhones in 2025: Should you buy the 17, Air, or Pro Max?I, along with other ZDNET authors, have covered Amazon's sales events for years. We keep an eye on popular product lines -- including AirPods, iPhones, iPads, and more -- and track any notable price changes in the lead-up to these events. While substantial discounts on Apple products are rare, this doesn't mean you can't save on your new device, especially when you know where to look. Here are the best early October Prime Day Apple deals I've found so far.

Current price: $Free with trade-inOriginal price: $1,100If you're debating upgrading your older iPhone to the new iPhone 17 Pro, now is the best time. Why? Because U.S. carriers always have promotional deals to lure new customers or re-contract with existing ones. Some of our favorite promotions come from Verizon, T-Mobile, and AT&T, which are offering a free device with a suitable trade-in or other bonuses -- such as free NFL Sunday tickets and credit toward new lines. Review: Should you upgrade to an iPhone 17 Pro from last year's model?

When is October Prime Day 2025?  This year, Amazon's October Prime Day sale runs from October 7 to 8. The annual sale will last for two days in the fall, and you can expect to see a range of deals on household goods and electronics. Are Apple devices really cheaper on Prime Day? Apple, directly, rarely offers significant sales and discounts on its products. But this doesn't mean that sales events, including October Prime Day, shouldn't be on your radar for Apple tech such as iPads, iPhones, and the Apple Watch -- as retailers such as Amazon and Walmart might have a deal or two that will save you at least 5% - 20% off the typical retail price. How did we choose these October Prime Day deals?ZDNET authors only write about deals that interest us personally and include products that we own, have tested, or want to buy. Our experts looked for deals that were at least 20% off (or are hardly ever on sale, as is often the case with Apple devices), using established price comparison tools and trackers to determine whether the deal actually represents value for your money. We also considered customer reviews to find out what matters to real people who already own and use the deals we're recommending. Our recommendations may also be based on our own testing -- in addition to extensive research and comparison shopping. The goal is to deliver the most accurate advice to help you shop smarter during limited-time events. What are the best early Prime Day deals?ZDNET's experts have been searching through early Prime Day and other sales to find the best discounts by category. These are the best deals live now: Best Prime Day deals Best Prime Day deals under $100 Best Prime Day deals under $25 Best Prime Day Apple deals Best Prime Day Samsung deals Best Prime Day laptop deals Best Prime Day TV deals Best Prime Day smartwatch and fitness trackers deals Best Prime Day phone deals Best Prime Day tablet deals Best Prime Day PC gaming deals Best Prime Day headphones deals Best Prime Day Kindle deals Best Prime Day Amazon Echo device deals Best Prime Day EcoFlow deals Best Prime Day Anker dealsAnd the best deals from other retailers: Best Buy deals Walmart deals Sam's Club deals Costco deals Target deals
