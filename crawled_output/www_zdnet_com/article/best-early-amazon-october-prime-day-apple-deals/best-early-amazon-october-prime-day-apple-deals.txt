Current price: $Free with trade-inOriginal price: $1,100If you're debating upgrading your older iPhone to the new iPhone 17 Pro, now is the best time. Why?

When is October Prime Day 2025?  This year, Amazon's October Prime Day sale runs from October 7 to 8. The annual sale will last for two days in the fall, and you can expect to see a range of deals on household goods and electronics. Are Apple devices really cheaper on Prime Day? Apple, directly, rarely offers significant sales and discounts on its products. But this doesn't mean that sales events, including October Prime Day, shouldn't be on your radar for Apple tech such as iPads, iPhones, and the Apple Watch -- as retailers such as Amazon and Walmart might have a deal or two that will save you at least 5% - 20% off the typical retail price. How did we choose these October Prime Day deals?ZDNET authors only write about deals that interest us personally and include products that we own, have tested, or want to buy. Our experts looked for deals that were at least 20% off (or are hardly ever on sale, as is often the case with Apple devices), using established price comparison tools and trackers to determine whether the deal actually represents value for your money. We also considered customer reviews to find out what matters to real people who already own and use the deals we're recommending. Our recommendations may also be based on our own testing -- in addition to extensive research and comparison shopping. The goal is to deliver the most accurate advice to help you shop smarter during limited-time events.
