How did I choose these AI chatbots?
To curate the list of best AI chatbots and AI writers, I considered each program's capabilities, including the individual uses each program would excel at. As an AI reporter, I also tested each one myself. Other factors I looked at were reliability, availability, and cost. Individual use case: AI chatbots have many use cases often centered around productivity and ease of workflow. I included a variety that can serve as ideation, education, and content creation tools. Reliability: I kept information accuracy a priority during my testing. Availability: ChatGPT is popular, but not always available. I selected alternatives that don't have a user limit and are available at all times. Cost: Many AI programs are free, but some require monthly memberships. I included a mix of both, keeping budget-friendliness in mind.

What is an AI chatbot?
An AI chatbot (also called an AI writer) is a type of AI-powered program capable of generating written content from a user's input prompt. AI chatbots can write anything from a rap song to an essay upon a user's request. The extent of what each chatbot can write about depends on its capabilities, including whether it is connected to a search engine.

How do AI chatbots work?
Chatbots use LLMs to train the AI to produce human-like responses. Some tools are connected to the web and that capability provides up-to-date information, while others depend solely on the information upon which they were trained.

What is the difference between an AI chatbot and an AI writer?
The main difference between an AI chatbot and an AI writer is the type of output they generate and their primary function.In the past, an AI writer was used specifically to generate written content, such as articles, stories, or poetry, based on a given prompt or input. An AI writer outputs text that mimics human-like language and structure. On the other hand, an AI chatbot is designed to conduct real-time conversations with users in text or voice-based interactions. The primary function of an AI chatbot is to answer questions, provide recommendations, or even perform simple tasks, and its output is in the form of text-based conversations.While the terms AI chatbot and AI writer are now used interchangeably by some, the original distinction was that an AI writer was used for generating static written content, while an AI chatbot was used for conversational purposes. However, with the introduction of more advanced AI technology, such as ChatGPT, the line between the two has become increasingly blurred. Many AI chatbots are now capable of generating text-based responses that mimic human-like language and structure, similar to an AI writer.
