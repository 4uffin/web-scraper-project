Amazon Fire Tablet HD 10 for $90 (save $50)
View at Amazon Our expert Maria Diaz previously reviewed the Amazon Fire HD 10 tablet Pro, and deemed it the better tablet option for kids --even over the iPad. In Diaz's review, she wrote that "since [her] iPad screen got cracked by a cheap case a couple of years ago, [she's] less than enthused about giving an eight-year-old such a fragile tablet." Luckily, a major selling point of this tablet is that Amazon will replace the device (or the device's screen) if it breaks within two years, and it's eligible for trade-ins. Also: The best iPad cases for kids
Maria Diaz/ZDNETOne thing we appreciate about this tablet is that it doesn't have to just be for kids. The tablet can be set up with multiple profiles (and has parental controls easily available), and its 3GB RAM ensures that users of all ages can stream or browse seamlessly. It's also got a 5MP front-facing camera for personal and work calls or for creating content (or for little ones to take selfies), and has a 13-hour battery life for its 1080p full HD display, promising vivid color on your screen. Also: The best GPS trackers for kids
Maria Diaz/ZDNETThe Amazon Fire HD 10 tablet has other features that check a lot of our boxes, including an octa-core processor that allows you to have multiple tabs open at once. It's also got three new smart tools that allow users to create wallpapers, summarize webpages, and polish up your emails. Though they're not included, the tablet can be used with an Amazon Stylus or a micro-SD card supplying up to 1 TB of extra storage. The Amazon Fire HD 10 tablet is made from 12% recycled materials, and is available in black, lilac, and ocean. Also: Best Amazon Prime Day Kindle deals before OctoberLooking for the next best product? Get expert reviews and editor favorites with ZDNET Recommends.How I rated this deal This tablet might not be suitable to replace your laptop, but it's an incredibly good deal if you're in the market for another tablet the entire family can enjoy. Its various profiles and parental controls make it easy for multiple users to make the most of the device, and its streaming speed and visual display are respectable. All in all, it's the latest model of a great multi-purpose device for under $100.
