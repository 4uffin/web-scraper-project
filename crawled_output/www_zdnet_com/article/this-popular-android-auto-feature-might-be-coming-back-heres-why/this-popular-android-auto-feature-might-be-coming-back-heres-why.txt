ZDNET | Charlie OsborneFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.ZDNET's key takeawaysGoogle appears to be reverting to an older Android Auto display.A recent upgrade to Material You changed the background colors.A recent beta version shows code that gives users a choice.Android Auto is scrapping a controversial feature.Last month, the Android in-car infotainment system rolled out a small change -- an update to the Material You design. The upgrade didn't add or take away any functionality, but changed the look of Android Auto to match your phone. Also: Android Auto not connecting? This one setting tweak fixed things for meThe new design features a single-color screen as the background instead of the previous version's blurred album artwork background. It doesn't change the listening experience at all, but it's nice to see the background change with each song. Users were quick to complain about the new redesign, and many strongly preferred the old way.Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Album covers make a comebackCode discovered by Android Authority in the latest beta version of Android Auto indicates that the fan-preferred artwork style may be set to make a return. In the code, there's an option to toggle between the two styles. If you like the old style, you can switch back. If the new style doesn't bother you, you can roll with it. Google hasn't announced any changes, and this doesn't mean anything will change for sure, but the fact that the code is present in a functional beta version indicates that the option to give users a choice is well into production and will likely become a full feature soon. Also: Finally, an Android Auto adapter that's reliable, highly functional, and won't break the bankNot everything is going back to exactly how it used to be, however, as Android Authority also discovered that the latest beta has smaller navigation buttons than before, but bigger album artwork and a larger seek bar. Want to follow my work? Add ZDNET as a trusted source on Google.Featured
