Elyse Betters Picaro / ZDNETFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.ZDNET's key takeawaysGoogle Gems are customizable AI assistants.You can now easily share them with others.The process is similar to using other Google tools. Once you start using AI chatbots consistently, you'll find use cases for them that you keep going back to. In these cases, it makes sense to start a Gem -- Google Gemini's customizable AI assistants -- so that you don't have to repeat yourself with instructions every time. But what if your family or team can benefit from them too? Now you can share them. Also: Gemini arrives in Chrome - here's everything it can do nowGoogle announced a Gemini upgrade on Thursday via a blog post, which, while small, can make a big impact on your team's or family's productivity. To share a Gem, all you need to do is click on "share" in your Gem manager, and you will be prompted with the same pop-up that comes up when sharing a Google Doc, Sheet, or Slide. Once the pop-up appears, you can either enter a person's email or copy a link to the Gem, which you can then share manually. Like the sharing experience across the other Google Suite applications, you can also make the access link restricted to only those that you have shared it with, or anyone with the link. How to set up Gems If you have never built a Gem, it is a simple concept. You basically enter all of the details you want it to know, as well as specific instructions, so that it can automatically call on them every time you use them. Think about it like giving an intern specific instructions on the task they are going to perform for you. Also: I got 4 years of product development done in 4 days for $200, and I'm still stunnedThe more detail, the better, and you can even use Gemini to help you build out your Gems' instructions. The use cases are endless, as they can be as simple as a Grocery list maker Gem that gathers all of the ingredients from all the recipes you feed it and compiles them in a master list, or as complex as automatically cleaning a dataset you give it to meet your set of criteria. For a step-by-step on how to build Gems, you can visit ZDNET's instructions. Artificial Intelligence
