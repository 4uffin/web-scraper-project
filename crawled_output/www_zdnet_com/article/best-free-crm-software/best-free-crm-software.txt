When you're running sales at a scrappy startup, every decision matters. Do you really need more software? The answer is usually no. But before you know it, you're drowning in spreadsheets, sticky notes, and huge gaps in memory about where you left off with a customer.Also: The best small-business CRM softwareYour growing business needs a proper CRM, or customer relationship management, system. But the budget is tight, so you're not ready to commit to expensive monthly subscriptions. Thankfully, you've got a significant number of free CRM options available. And just because it's "free," doesn't mean it's low quality. Many premium CRM vendors offer limited access to their platform free of charge, as long as your needs are reasonable. So if you're thinking about getting a CRM but don't feel ready to pull out your credit card just yet, here are the best options for you.What is the best free CRM software right now?While there's more than one good choice, my top pick for a free CRM has got to be HubSpot. The platform offers unlimited users and contacts (up to 1 million), email marketing, landing pages, live chat, and a powerful reporting tool -- all completely free. I was genuinely struck by how much HubSpot packs into its free tier, without limitations to force quick upgrades.Also: The best CRM softwareWhen evaluating these platforms, I focused on five key factors that matter most to growing businesses. First, I tested the actual usability. How quickly could I get up and running without up-front training? Second, I examined the contact and deal management capabilities, since that's the core of any CRM. Third, I looked at integration options, because your CRM needs to play nicely with other tools. Keep reading for more details on my top picks.

View now at Odoo Odoo takes a different approach than traditional CRMs by positioning itself as an all-in-one tool for enterprise resource planning, or ERP. The free Community Edition gives you access to basic CRM features, but you can connect your customer relationships to accounting, inventory, and project management data. I also found the sales pipeline management simple and straightforward, familiar for anyone who's worked in a sales role.Odoo is really good at plugging into different business functions. When you generate a quote in the CRM, it can automatically create invoices and schedule deliveries from your inventory. It's rare to see this level of integration in product-based CRMs, especially in a free one.However, Odoo does require more setup time than simpler alternatives. But the payoff comes in significantly more customization options. Odoo's modular approach lets you start with basic CRM features and then add in accounting, website building, or e-commerce capabilities as needed. The recent 2025 updates have improved the user interface a ton, though it's still too complex for just basic contact management.Odoo features: Sales pipeline | Lead management | Quote generation | Invoice creation | Project tracking | Inventory sync | Website builder

With support for 250 contacts and up to two users, it's perfectly sized for solo entrepreneurs or very small teams just getting started with CRM.

And there's a full contact center built directly into the CRM, allowing you to make and receive calls without switching platforms.Moreover, Bitrix24 comes with project management tools, a website builder with e-commerce capabilities, and even HR management features.

I like how it handles marketing automation, which includes a drag-and-drop workflow designer for complex campaigns.

During testing, I knew exactly when prospects opened emails and clicked links, thanks to the built-in tracker. You can also monitor Twitter streams, schedule posts, and even include social interactions in automated campaigns.What's more, web pop-up and survey tools help capture leads directly from your website. An appointment-scheduling feature lets customers book their own meetings based on available time slots, which saves time going back and forth between emails.

Factors to consider when choosing free CRM software
When deciding on a free CRM, you have to look beyond the value offered by the free plan to make sure the platform can scale with your business as it grows. Switching isn't impossible, but finding a solution that balances free tools with advanced paid functionality is better.Free plan limits: Free plans typically restrict the number of contacts you can store and users who can access the system, but there are exceptions. HubSpot, for instance, offers unlimited contacts, while Capsule limits you to 250. So consider your current database and team size.Learning curve: Some platforms, like Bitrix24, offer lots of different modules, which can overwhelm beginners. But others, like Capsule, focus on clean contact management above all else. Think about what you actually need out of your CRM. Then put it into perspective against your team's skill set.Integration capabilities: CRM software needs to connect with your existing communication tools, like Gmail or Outlook. It also needs to play well with your invoicing system and business management tool. Check how many native integrations are available in the free tier versus paid plans. Plus, look for advanced paid features like an API.Upgrade paths: Consider how the platform grows with your business and what paid features you'll eventually need. Then look at how much you'll need to pay once you start outgrowing the free plan.Data security and compliance: CRMs may have different security standards depending on cost, which is very important if you handle sensitive customer information. Review privacy policies to make sure the platform doesn't sell your customer data without permission.Training resources: Free plans often provide limited customer support, if any. So evaluate the available documentation, community forums, and training materials to make sure you have the self-help resources you need to get started.Other limitations: Many free CRMs also restrict data storage and email sends per month. If you're looking for a CRM that doubles as an email marketing tool like ActiveCampaign or Brevo, you need to pay attention to this too.

How did I choose these free CRM tools?
I've worked as a business-to-business software reviewer for most of my journalism career, testing platforms for sales, marketing, and beyond. Over time, I've picked up on the things that separate good software from good marketing.I like to review software by creating scenarios that mimic real-world applications. For these CRM tools, I created fictional sales pipelines, contact databases, and automated workflows to see how they'd hold up during normal use. I also tested integrations with common business tools, like Gmail and Slack.I chose platforms that offer genuine value in their free tiers, rather than limited trials designed to force quick upgrades. Beyond the free plan, I also looked into the different upgrade paths to find platforms that won't make you sign up for expensive plans right out of the gate.

FAQs on free CRM software
Is there a fully free CRM that doesn't require upgrading?
While most free CRMs have limitations that eventually require upgrades, some platforms offer more generous free tiers with unlimited contacts. However, "forever free" options without any limits don't exist. So you'll probably have to compromise on some things to access the free tools.
Show more
What's the difference between free and paid CRM?
Free platforms typically include basic contact management, simple sales pipelines, and limited storage for newcomers. Paid versions offer advanced automation, custom integrations, and priority support. Trade-offs in free plans usually come in the form of restrictions, whether on the number of contacts, users, or emails.
Show more
Can small businesses really run on free CRM software?
Yes, many small and midsize businesses can operate effectively on free CRM plans, especially businesses with fewer than 10 users and less than 1,000 contacts. Free plans provide essential features like contact management, deal tracking, and basic reporting that cover most small-business needs.Also: The best small-business CRM software

How secure is my data in free CRM software?
Free tools may not offer the same level of security as paid CRMs, so you need to review their data encryption, access controls, and compliance features. Always check the platform's privacy policies and ensure they meet any industry-specific requirements before you upload your data.
Show more
What happens to my data if I outgrow the free plan?
Most reputable CRM providers offer upgrade paths that preserve your existing data when moving to paid plans. However, you should verify data export capabilities before committing to any free CRM, so you can migrate to a different vendor if needed.
