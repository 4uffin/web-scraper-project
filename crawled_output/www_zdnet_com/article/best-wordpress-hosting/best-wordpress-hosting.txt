Many websites now use a content management system (CMS) for backend management. You don't need to know any coding -- such as HTML or CSS -- to build or operate a website these days. WordPress is one of the most popular options around, according to W3Techs, around 61% of all websites with a known CMS using the service.

Every time he's had a support issue, the service has jumped in and gone above and beyond. "I also like that Pagely hosts on top of the AWS infrastructure, so I never worry about maintenance and server reliability issues," Gewirtz says. "To be blunt: If I had one hosting provider to recommend, and if you can handle their pricing, I'd unreservedly recommend Pagely. And no, it's not paying me to say that. I pay them every month."Who it's for: Customers applaud Pagely as a solid platform with great support. Plans begin at $375 per month, so this price point is best suited for enterprise-grade projects.Who should look elsewhere: Small businesses and individuals who want to launch new, entry projects won't need this sort of power or infrastructure, but there's always the option to migrate in the future. Pagely features: Enterprise-grade hosting | E-commerce support | Staging | Dedicated or decoupled databases | Flexible configurations | Managed DevOps | High storage levels | 24/7 support

Factors to consider when choosing a WordPress hosting provider:
If you're looking at the hosting providers included in this guide, you've already made one decision: To pick a provider experienced in hosting WordPress. Next, you should consider the following factors:Size and scalability: Depending on how many sites you want to operate and what kind of traffic you expect to have, consider providers that offer hosting capable of adapting and scaling up to your needs.Budget: You should consider your budget and how much you would be happy to spend on your project or business. Keep in mind that hosting multiple websites beyond introductory periods may result in price increases.Customization: Consider whether you need a "one size fits all" WordPress host or one that allows you to perform deep customization.Media: If you intend to showcase bandwidth-heavy media on your website, including 4K videos, you may need to check how much storage and traffic support is on offer.Support and services: The more complex your site, the more you might want WordPress hosting with stronger support and administrative functions. At the very least, you will want to choose a provider that has a variety of customer support channels in case you need technical support or help with migrating your website.Security: DDoS and similar attacks are no joke. They can hamper access to your website and frustrate visitors. Ensure you pick a hosting provider dedicated to security. Free trials: If a service offers a free trial period, test out porting your site, getting support, the dashboard interface, and overall performance before agreeing to a long-term contract.

How we chose the best WordPress hosting providers
At ZDNET, when we considered the best WordPress hosting providers of 2024, we took into account a number of factors:Experience: Many ZDNET authors have personal, long-term experience with the vendors on this list, with everything from budget-conscious WordPress hosting services to enterprise-level support. We also consulted with experts for their recommendations.Customer reviews: We took customer feedback and reviews into account and shied away from vendors with poor track records. We keep an eye on customer reports to monitor for any drastic changes in service. Use cases: We included a range of WordPress hosts suitable for different users and purposes, including vendors offering scalable solutions, products suitable for small businesses and projects, and enterprise-ready WordPress hosting options.Migration, one-click installs: These are two features we like WordPress hosting providers to offer. Setting up a new WordPress backend or moving a website can be time-consuming, and so we appreciate it when vendors provide a way for customers to quickly manage these tasks. Advanced features: We wanted to see optional advanced features for customers who need more than standard hosting. These include SEO assistance, AI-based technologies, e-commerce, security functions, and tailored support.Pricing: The prices set by WordPress hosting providers vary widely, so we have endeavored to include a range of options suitable for most budgets.
