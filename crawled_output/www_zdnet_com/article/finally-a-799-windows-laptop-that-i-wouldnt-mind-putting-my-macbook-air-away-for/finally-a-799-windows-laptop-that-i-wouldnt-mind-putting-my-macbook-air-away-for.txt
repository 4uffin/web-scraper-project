Acer Aspire 16 AI
ZDNET's key takeaways The Acer Aspire 16 AI is currently on sale for $699. It's a reliable, lightweight workhorse with a marathon battery that's ideal for long days.However, its hardware has performance limitations. View now at AcerView now at Amazon more buying choices Acer's new Aspire 16 AI is a humble laptop. It isn't flashy or over-the-top, it doesn't house high-end hardware or an OLED screen. Instead, it focuses on being a reliable work device with a midrange price tag. Considering how expensive things are nowadays, we need more laptops like this now more than ever before -- especially if you're a college student.For students, the Aspire 16 is a reliable device with enough battery power to get through the day. Instead of bells and whistles, it delivers solid performance and a slim form factor that's easy to commute with.
ZDNET RECOMMENDS Acer Aspire 16 AI With its smooth 120Hz display, 1440p webcam, and approachable price, Acer's Aspire 16 AI stands out as a practical device.

Sleek designThe Acer Aspire 16 AI opts for a practical design, measuring 14 x 9.85 x 0.63 inches and weighing 3.42 pounds, it's sleek, sliding easily into most backpacks. Build quality is solid, and its weight is evenly distributed, passing the "one-finger test" without a hint of wobble.I also appreciate the spacious touchpad, which measures 5.9 x 3.5 inches and provides plenty of room for comfortable navigating. You can move from one side of the screen to the other without needing to lift your finger off. Too often, budget laptops cut corners by equipping cramped touchpads.
Cesar Cadenas/ZDNETTyping on the Aspire 16 felt mostly satisfying. The main set of keys is evenly spaced out and offers a decent amount of travel distance, making it easy to type quickly. That said, the keys have a slightly mushy feel; it's not the most crispy keyboard. Plus, the up and down arrow keys, as well as the number pad, are undersized. They're perfectly functional, although you may accidentally bump keys. Made for schoolAbove the keyboard sits a 16-inch LCD touchscreen that delivers a solid all-around viewing experience. The panel covers the entire sRGB gamut, so although colors don't pop with the vibrance of an OLED, they're not dull, either. What the Aspire 16's display lacks in wow factor, it makes up for in other areas. At a resolution of 1,920 x 1,200 pixels and a refresh rate of 120Hz, it delivers crisp visuals.Also: How much RAM do you really need in 2025? I broke it down for Mac and Windows usersA refresh rate that high is typically found on gaming laptops. While you won't be doing high-end gaming on this laptop because of its hardware, you will appreciate how smooth everything feels. I experienced this firsthand during testing when I ran a night driving livestream on YouTube. The built-in speakers aren't particularly impressive, but they do offer a respectable amount of volume and clarity.
Cesar Cadenas/ZDNETOn the downside, I did run into some visual quirks, like color banding. This is where color gradients break into visible pieces instead of blending seamlessly, but it is a rare occurrence.A real standout feature is its 1440p webcam. For business people and students alike, this is a big win. Most other laptops in this category opt for 1080p -- or even 720p cameras. The higher resolution produces a clean, sharp image with natural-looking colors as well as none of the graininess you'd encounter recording over a low-quality webcam. Combined with speedy connectivity standards like Wi-Fi 7, the Aspire 16 AI is well-equipped for online and offline work.Featherweight performanceInside the Acer Aspire 16 AI is a Qualcomm Snapdragon X chipset paired with 16GB of RAM, a configuration that prioritizes energy efficiency. During testing, the device lasted just 17 hours on a single charge. That's pretty impressive. Acer states that the Aspire 16 can stretch that runtime to as much as 28 hours under the right conditions. Either way, this marathon battery makes the model a strong option for people who don't want to constantly reach for the charger.When it comes to everyday performance, Acer's machine did well. It supported over 50 Chrome tabs, consisting of high-res livestreams, a Netflix movie, news articles, and more, without flinching. This level of multitasking shows that the Aspire 16 is versatile enough for students looking for a computer flexible enough for bouncing between homework and streaming or professionals juggling multiple apps.Also: Best Amazon Prime Day laptop deals 2025: I'm tracking 30 of my favorite discounts ahead of OctoberThat said, there are some trade-offs. First, the Snapdragon X is a Windows on ARM chip, meaning not every app is fully supported. Most programs are fine, with a few exceptions, like the benchmarking app Cinebench 24. Compatibility issues are rarer these days, but you can run into them. Also, because the Snapdragon X is a mid-tier chipset, the Aspire 16 is might have some trouble keeping up with extremely demanding workloads. Here's how it compares to similar computers in benchmarking relative to price.  Honestly, the performance gap isn't massive, and for most people, the difference is negligible, but it still exists. What tips the scale in Acer's favor is value. While the rivals perform better, they're more expensive -- twice as much in the case of the Dell 16 Plus. The Aspire 16 delivers a comparable experience at a better price point. For people on a budget, that affordability makes the laptop an attractive option despite any limitations it has.
Cesar Cadenas/ZDNETZDNET's buying adviceRight now, you can purchase the Acer Aspire 16 AI from the company's official website for $700. Acer developed this laptop primarily for tech-savvy students who need a versatile device to help with school work and have a long-lasting battery. I agree with Acer on their choice of core audience, and think this laptop suits them well.  If you're looking for a more premium alternative, I recommend the Dell 16 Plus. It's very similar in terms of size and target audience, but Dell's model is more suited to demanding tasks, has a more premium build, and a nicer 2.5K touchscreen (but is twice the price). Featured reviews
