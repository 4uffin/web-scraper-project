The holiday shopping season is right around the corner, and if you're an early bird shopper, Amazon's upcoming Prime Big Deal Days sale (also known as October Prime Day) has your name on it. While the big commerce event doesn't officially begin until Oct. 7-8, there are already several noteworthy deals on the latest smartphones available for you to take advantage of -- many of which we've tested and recommended at ZDNET. Also: The best phones we've tested this yearConsidering how close October Prime Day is to Black Friday and Cyber Monday, there's a good chance that prices won't drop any lower. (When in doubt, take advantage of Amazon's 30-day return policy or contact customer service for a price adjustment.) Here are the best early Prime Day phone deals we've found so far.Find Prime Day dealsBest phone deals for October Prime Day 2025An October Prime Day is an ideal time to upgrade your smartphone because you can make a more informed decision right now. All major launches from the likes of Apple, Samsung, and Google are out of the way, so you have a rough idea of how they stack up against each other. And Prime Day brings the price to a more affordable range on some of the best Android phones on the market. Here are some of the best early Prime Day 2025 deals that you shouldn't miss.
Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 for $1700 (save $300)
Prakhar Khanna/ZDNET
Current price: $1700 (15% off)Original price: $2000The 512GB variant of Samsung's latest Galaxy Z Fold 7 is my ideal smartphone. You get plenty of storage on a smartphone that can be considered a design marvel. It is slim and light, supports seven years of software upgrades, sports versatile cameras, and big and bright displays. Samsung nailed it out of the park this year, and the deal price makes it more tempting than ever.Review: Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7

Motorola Razr 2025 for $600 (save $200)
Kerry Wan/ZDNET
Current price: $600 (14% off)Original price: $700The Motorola Razr 2025 is one of the most affordable folding phones you can buy right now. It gives you a big inner display, which can be folded into a tiny phone with a flexible cover screen. The outer display is perfect for quick tasks and instant replies. It is better than the Galaxy Z Flip 7 in this regard.Review: Motorola Razr 2025

Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra for $1048 (save $252)
Prakhar Khanna/ZDNET
Current price: $1048 (19% off)Original price: $1300The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra remains one of the best phones to buy in October 2025, despite being launched early in the year. It sports the best display on a smartphone that we've tested, versatility with four rear cameras, powerful performance, and a decent battery life. While the S Pen isn't what it used to be, it is still great for jotting down quick notes.Review: Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra

Nothing Phone (2a) Plus for $289 (save $110)
Kerry Wan/ZDNET
Current price: $289 (28% off)Original price: $399The Nothing Phone (2a) Plus will get you one of the best software experiences under $300. It sports a big, legible screen, plenty of power under the hood, and smart OS features that improve the user experience. Plus, the battery will last you all day.Review: Nothing Phone (2a) Plus

Motorola Edge 2025 for $450 (save $100)
Max Buondonno/ZDNET
Current price: $450 (18% off)Original price: $550The Motorola Edge is one of the few non-Samsung, non-Google phones under $500 that's still worth buying. It gives you a big, vibrant display, plenty of cameras on the back, superfast charging capabilities, and a long-lasting battery life. The software support won't be as good as the Pixel 9a but it is better than the Google phone in almost every other aspect.

Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge for $700 (save $1100)
Kerry Wan/ZDNET
Current price: $700 (36% off)Original price: $1100The one true Apple iPhone Air rival, Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge, is the thinnest Android flagship phone you can buy. I consider it the true compact phone for content consumption, and you still get one more camera lens than the Apple counterpart. The battery life isn't as good as its more expensive Ultra sibling but it is a great phone for everyday use.Review: Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge

Motorola Moto G Power 2025 for $250 (save $50)
Cesar Cadenas/ZDNET
Current price: $250 (17% off)Original price: $300The Moto G Power remains my go-to recommendation for those who want excellent battery life on their new phone for under $300. It'll easily last you more than a day, despite its tall display, satisfactory cameras and smooth OS. On Prime Day sale, this is one of the best phones you can buy under $250.Review: Motorola Moto G Power 2025

Google Pixel 9 for $685 (save $105)
Kerry Wan/ZDNET
Current price: $685 (14% off)Original price: $800Last year's Google Pixel flagship is still a solid offering with $105 discount. It'll provide long software support, above-average cameras, smooth user experience, and new features with Pixel Drop updates. If the new Pixel 10 isn't for you due to some reason, the Pixel 9 is a good alternative.Review: Google Pixel 9

The official dates are set as October 7-8, but expect more deals to go live as we head towards the big sale.Are smartphones really cheaper on Prime Day? Yes, smartphones are cheaper on Prime Day, especially now in October. This sale is commencing right before the big events like Black Friday and Cyber Monday, so prices are unlikely to drop further. Grab the deals before they expire.How did we choose these October Prime Day deals? ZDNET only writes about deals we want to buy. We consider products from our personal experience with each one of them. These are the phones that we desire, need, or would recommend. Our experts looked for deals that were at least 20% off (or are hardly ever on sale), using established price comparison tools and trackers to determine whether the deal is actually on sale and how frequently it drops.
We aim to deliver the most accurate advice to help you shop smarter.  So, we also looked over customer reviews to find out what matters to real people who already own and use the deals we're recommending. Our recommendations may also be based on our own testing -- in addition to extensive research and comparison shopping.
