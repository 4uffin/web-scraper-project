At a time when data breaches are a daily occurrence, securing your online accounts is a must. When you have a dozen or more online accounts, with each service requiring complex username and password combinations, trying to remember each one is an impossible task. This is where password managers shine.

They also streamline otherwise time-consuming authentication processes. While passwordless options are available, traditional password managers are also effective. Keeping sensitive information safe is more important than ever, and a reliable password manager can effectively solve security and password overload.Also: The best password managers for businesses: Expert testedGet more in-depth ZDNET tech coverage: Add us as a preferred Google source on Chrome and Chromium browsers.What is the best password manager right now?My pick for best overall choice, 1Password, has a user-friendly interface that simplifies credential storage.

Factors to consider when choosing a password manager
There is a wide range of password managers on the market today. To help you make the right decision, consider these factors:Security: Security is the top priority when it comes to password managers. The most secure password managers offer advanced encryption and use safe protocols to protect personal information when transferring from the service to your device and vice versa. Frequent patches: You should always choose a password manager that frequently releases patches and security fixes. No software is 100% invulnerable against cyberattacks and it's vital that vendors conduct audits and are quick to resolve emerging security issues. Storage: Another important consideration is storage capacity. While some password managers limit the number of passwords you can store, others offer unlimited storage so that you can add all your information without restrictions.Compatibility: It's essential to check if your preferred device and operating system are compatible with the password manager. The best options offer cross-platform compatibility, allowing you to access your data from multiple devices, including your computer, tablet, and mobile device.Accounts: If you want to assign a person more than one identity or online account, consider whether the family -- or business -- accounts are worth the money. Features: You may like a data breach scanner, secure vault, autofill, or passwordless options. If the additional features of password managers interest you, see if the solution you are considering has them.Open source: Open-source options should be considered when possible as the code is open to outside auditing for security vulnerabilities and flaws. This can boost trust in a product.

How does a password manager work?
Password managers are digital tools that can help you keep safely track and organize all your passwords and other sensitive information. Once you create an account with a password manager, you can add your login credentials, credit card details, and other personal data into the password vault. You can add this information all at once or over time as you use different websites and apps.The password manager will then store all your data in an encrypted format, making it difficult for hackers to decipher. Whenever you visit a site or use an app requiring login credentials, the password manager can automatically fill in your username and password for you. This feature can save you a lot of time and hassle, especially if you
manage many different accounts.Another feature of the best password managers is the ability to generate strong passwords. These passwords are typically long and random, making them more difficult to guess or crack. Password managers can create and store these complex passwords for you, making it easier to keep your accounts secure.Password managers can be invaluable for anyone who wants to keep their online accounts safe and secure.

You can also use a password manager to create strong, unique passwords for each account, reducing the risk of being hacked. Alternatively, some browsers, such as Google Chrome, offer built-in password managers.

Is a browser-based password manager enough?
Browser-based password managers -- such as the one built into the Google Chrome browser -- are convenient, but the offerings are limited. Browser-based password managers are usually limited in scope and are bolt-ons to the overall browser experience, and they usually aren't multi-platform. They also may be more susceptible to malware and compromise than standalone password manager solutions.

What are passwordless options?
Passwords may one day become a thing of the past, but we have a long way to go. Passwordless authentication systems are linked most commonly to the FIDO Alliance, which promotes an open standard of passwordless authentication using passkeys.
Passkeys are encrypted, safer than passwords, and use a key pair -- only you have the private key -- to authenticate at the time of a sign-in request.

Generally speaking, yes. You will find that many security experts consider password managers to be one of the best solutions for managing countless complex passwords.

What else could I use to protect my online accounts?
If you aren't keen on the idea of a password manager -- or a password manager alone -- we recommend that you purchase a physical security key. Physical security keys and dongles provide an additional layer of cryptographic protection for your online accounts. Unless a cybercriminal has physical access to your key, it is challenging to compromise your credentials. Also: The best security keys you can buy: Expert tested
