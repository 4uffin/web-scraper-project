As many governments worldwide are tightening online controls and imposing censorship measures, using a virtual private network (VPN) is becoming more important than ever. A VPN is one of the best and most accessible ways to improve your online privacy. They can be used to hide your location, change your IP address, and stop online eavesdropping. Many of us use a VPN on multiple devices by directly installing the VPN's app, but installing a VPN on your router can be far easier. Setting up a VPN on your router provides blanket security and privacy coverage across home devices. This means you don't need to install VPN software on each device, and the process is easier than you think. Some router manufacturers also provide products with preinstalled VPNs. Also: Best business VPNs of 2025Get more in-depth ZDNET tech coverage: Add us as a preferred Google source on Chrome and Chromium browsers.What is the best VPN router right now?My pick for the best overall VPN router is the Privacy Hero 2.

View now at FlashRoutersView now at NordVPN The Privacy Hero 2, available from FlashRouters, is my top pick for VPN-ready routers in 2025.Why we like it: After reviewing this model, what stood out the most was how easy it is to set up and use. The idea of spending time diving into the technical area of a router to configure a VPN won't appeal to most. With the Privacy Hero 2, this job is done for you. The Privacy Hero 2 is lightweight, and the VPN itself can be managed through an online dashboard. You can select from VPNs, including NordVPN, Surfshark, and Private Internet Access, or opt for protocols such as WireGuard. In addition, you can quickly swap between streaming servers and the country you would like to appear from. I also liked just how easy it was to switch server locations and countries from my web browser. This is a handy feature if you are checking out different streaming and content libraries, or if you are having trouble with a specific server.Review: Is a VPN-ready router the ultimate Wi-Fi upgrade? I tested one to find outAn ad-blocker is also included by default, and it works pretty well as a way to reduce clutter during online sessions, including watching YouTube videos -- I recommend you research which servers are best for this purpose.Who it's for: This model is suitable for medium-sized homes and offers speeds of up to 3,000Mbps. It also comes with a year of free NordVPN access, so you can enjoy VPN connectivity for 12 months before having to renew.The Privacy Hero 2's typical recommended retail price (RRP) is $250.

View now at AmazonView now at ExpressVPN The ExpressVPN Aircove is another one of my top picks thanks to its speed, ease of setup, and security. Why we like it: When selecting a VPN-ready router, consider stability and speed among your priorities. The $190 Aircove achieves speeds up to 1,200Mbps (600Mbps/2.4GHz) when the VPN is not in use. You should still expect speeds to drop marginally when you are connected to VPN servers.ExpressVPN is one of my favorite VPNs of 2025. This is largely due to consistently minimal speed loss during my tests, as well as its suitability for beginners, streaming, and traveling. If you plan to use a VPN on your router 24/7, it is an excellent choice, either via Aircove or another VPN-ready router with support for ExpressVPN's protocol.There's also a feature to diversify the servers used by devices connected to the router. For example, you might not want to connect your gaming PC to the VPN and have an office laptop run through a U.S. or U.K. server. Parents and guardians can also take advantage of parental control settings.Also: ExpressVPN vs SurfsharkWho it's for: It offers dual-band connectivity for homes and offices, providing coverage of up to 1,600 square feet, making this router another suitable option for family homes.You will need an , but a free trial is included with the router. ExpressVPN subscriptions have recently dropped in price, with plans beginning at $3.49 per month on a two-year contract. Four months of free access are included. Customer feedback indicates that users enjoy its excellent speed and performance, but there are some reports of instability. Who should look elsewhere: If $3.49 per month is a bit more than you want to spend on a VPN, I've listed other router options with cheaper or free VPNs included. ExpressVPN Aircove features: Wi-Fi 6 | Built-in VPN | 802.11ax, 802.11ac | Diverse server locations | Ad-blocking | Threat manager | Parental controls | Includes free trial
Pros
Built-in VPN

VPN router vs VPN app: How do you decide?
There are advantages and disadvantages to using a VPN-enabled router or a standalone VPN app, the most important of which are below.VPN routerVPN app A VPN router provides blanket coverage for all of your devices at home.A VPN app's coverage is limited by the number of simultaneous connections you are allowed under one account.A VPN router can be complicated to set up, and most routers do not come with a built-in VPN.

What is a VPN router service and why should you use one?
A VPN router service is a VPN that can either be installed directly on a compatible router or has already been enabled on a specific router. Today's routers are often compatible with VPNs but installing them isn't always the same process. You may have to be comfortable with a deep dive into technical settings and have a basic understanding of networking to do so. Some VPN providers offer routers with preinstalled VPN software, but you must sign up for a subscription. Consider using a VPN-ready router if you do not want to have to go through the process of installing the software manually on all of your devices or if you want to ensure that every device connected to your Wi-Fi network is protected. Just keep in mind that you may be locked to a particular VPN and it may be difficult to switch providers in the future.

How to set up your VPN router: Configuration and encryption made simple
Installing a VPN on your router allows all your devices to access the same VPN network and connection. This creates blanket protection and IP masking, but it can be challenging to set up.Remember that your router will act as a VPN client rather than a server and share the VPN with devices connected to it. Here are some general steps to take, although they may change depending on your router and existing setup:Check your router's compatibility. Not every router will run a VPN natively, but many modern routers do have the capacity.Sign up for a VPN service. Unless your router comes with a built-in VPN, you will likely need a subscription.Access your VPN's firmware. You will need to do so through your router's internet protocol (IP) address.Under settings, you should find a VPN tab, and you will need to enable VPN services and choose between a static or dynamic IP address.The VPN client can now be installed, although you may need to tweak your network settings. For an extensive installation guide, check out:How to set up a VPN on your router

When you are researching a new VPN router, consider these points before making a purchase:Do it yourself? If you want a VPN for your home network, consider installing one directly on your router. DIY options often require some technical knowledge, and you will need to be comfortable changing your router settings. Preinstalled options: If you don't want to tamper with router settings yourself to install a VPN, consider a router model that comes with a VPN
preinstalled. Pre-installed VPNs may be custom VPNs provided by the router manufacturers or they will be the result of partnerships with third-party VPN providers. Affordability: VPN routers are available for a variety of budgets. If you can, consider a future-proof VPN router that can support next-generation Wi-Fi and provide good coverage and speeds. Larger homes will need more square footage of coverage. VPN: You also need to take into account the VPN service you want to use. If you have a preferred VPN, ensure that the router you want supports it.Subscriptions: You will likely need to purchase a subscription, as free VPNs will usually limit your device connections. While there are a handful of free VPN plans offered by trustworthy vendors, most of them come with limitations. These may not be suitable for use on a router, as you may quickly run out of bandwidth. As a result, you should factor in the cost of a VPN subscription, even if it is just a basic plan.Other purposes: The VPN might be the most important aspect, but you should also consider whether other features are important to you, such as tri-band functionality, gaming optimization, or additional security features.

How did I choose these VPN routers?
While compiling my recommendations for the best VPN routers of 2025, I considered a number of important factors, including:Speed: There's no point investing in a new router capable of handling VPN environments unless it serves its core purpose: providing fast, solid, and stable connections to the internet. Home coverage: I considered traditional router models and options that provide scalable mesh networking for larger homes needing a wider internet coverage net.VPN support: I included a range of models with built-in VPNs, standalone VPN support, and mobile products for VPN protection on the go. I know that what might suit one user won't always suit another, so the VPN options must be flexible.Budgets: I covered different budgets. Although my priorities are security, speed, and reliability, I wanted to ensure that we included affordable products alongside future-proofed routers.Customer reviews: I also examined customer reviews in depth, including positive and negative experiences, and factored this feedback into our recommendations.Vendor reputation: I considered the reputation of router manufacturers, including their popularity, variety, and product accessibility.

The bottom line: Is a VPN router worth it?
If you want to install a VPN directly onto a router, the process can be more of a hassle than just signing up for an app. It can also save you time in the long run as any device that connects to your router will use the VPN and be protected. This can be particularly useful if you have internet-connected devices, including TVs and IoT products, that cannot support a VPN on their own hardware. You might want to consider setting up a VPN on your router if you work from home with numerous devices needing protection. If you are a remote worker, some organizations may require you to use their own VPN to access corporate resources.Some online platforms, such as streaming services, will detect when you are using a VPN and may block you. If this is the case, you may have to temporarily disable your VPN service to resume watching.

Can any router be a VPN router?
Many routers are now intelligent devices capable of far more than providing an internet connection. Today, you can install VPN software on many different routers, and VPN support is often promoted as a major feature. However, before making a purchase, find out whether the router supports WireGuard or OpenVPN.A word of caution: Installing third-party software on your router might void its warranty, just as jailbreaking mobile devices invalidates a warranty.

Why would anyone use a VPN?
A VPN can be a great tool for protecting your privacy. At the very least, VPNs should be used when you are taking advantage of public Wi-Fi hotspots, but using them while you're online as a default is the better option to protect yourself and your information. VPNs are also beneficial in circumventing geolocation blocks and censorship.At home, you can use a VPN on your router to provide blanket coverage for any device connected to the hub. This includes your laptop, PC, smartphone, and even your TV. Some countries either ban VPN usage entirely or heavily discourage it. If using a VPN is illegal, you may be fined or prosecuted. According to NordVPN's country guide, Belarus and Iraq ban VPNs, whereas governments in China and Russia only permit specific VPNs.

Does a work VPN expose my home network to my employer?
It's possible, but it depends on several factors. VPNs handle traffic in different ways, but overall, it is highly unlikely that company IT administrators will be able to access your home network via your VPN connection. If you are on a work-issued laptop with software that allows such connections, however, IT administrators will most likely be able to monitor your activities and tap into resources on the device.Additionally, while VPN tunnels encrypt your traffic and mask your online activities, you can be monitored if you use a VPN designed, licensed, or owned by your employer. VPNs can protect corporate resources, and you should keep work and private online activities separate.

Does a VPN slow down your internet connection?
Yes, but a high-quality VPN shouldn't make a noticeable difference. There are caveats; for example, you should expect a slowdown when connecting to servers across a long distance, such as from the U.K. to Australia. If, however, you experience severe speed loss when you are connecting to servers closer to you, such as from New York to Washington, this may indicate a problem with either the VPN or your internet service provider (ISP) connection. Try to connect to another server close by and then run a speed test to see if that resolves the issue.

Do I need to pay for a VPN when I buy a VPN router?
Sometimes. Some router manufacturers, like Asus, will include a VPN or VPN support, but if you want a high level of control over your VPN, you will likely need to factor in the cost of a VPN subscription. Typically, VPN providers market their pricing on monthly equivalent models. However, you often pay for your chosen subscription upfront. For example, a VPN marketed with a $1 monthly cost on a yearly contract will likely require you to pay $12 upfront, plus tax. However, some VPN router providers will give you the first year of a VPN subscription for free.You enjoy the best discounts when signing up for longer terms. Two years is usually the longest term you can sign up for, although some VPN providers offer five-year subscriptions.

Can I use a free third-party VPN on a router?
Free VPNs, unless they are provided by the router manufacturer, aren't typically suitable for use with routers. This is due to the limitations imposed on free plans, which include capped bandwidth or limited servers, which can impact speed. If you want blanket coverage in your home, you won't want to deal with bandwidth and speed limits, and so we recommend you opt for a paid plan.
