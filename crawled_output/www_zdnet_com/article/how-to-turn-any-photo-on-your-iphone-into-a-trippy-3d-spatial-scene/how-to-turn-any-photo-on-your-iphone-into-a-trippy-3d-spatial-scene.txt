This iOS 26 trick made my old iPhone photos really pop - in 3D
With iOS 26, your photos can turn into dynamic images that shift and bend as you move - and you don't even need a new iPhone.

Elyse Betters Picaro / ZDNETFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.ZDNET's key takeawaysTurn flat photos into 3D scenes with iOS 26 Spatial Scenes.Works on iPhone 12 or newer -- no special hardware needed.Enable with one tap in Photos or set on your Lock Screen.If you've updated to iOS 26, you might have noticed a new hexagon button in the Photos app. It's called Spatial Scenes, and it turns regular photos into dynamic, 3D-like images that respond to your movements. So, instead of staying flat and static, your photo shifts and bends slightly as you tilt your iPhone. The best part? Spatial Scenes retrofits depth into existing pictures in your photo library.Also: Got iOS 26? Turn on this iPhone setting to make your screenshots instantly better - here's howWhen I first saw Apple demo the feature during its event keynote, I thought it looked cool but also wondered, who actually uses all these gimmicky photo tricks? I've now had the chance to test it, and I'm surprised at how fun it is to try. And you don't need one of the new iPhone 17 models either -- Spatial Scenes work on the iPhone 12 or later, no special lenses or sensors required.
How to turn your iPhone photo into a spatial scene
What you'll need: An iPhone 12 or newer running iOS 26.
1. Open the Photos app and choose an image
When you enable Spatial Scene on a photo, it analyzes the image, separates the subject from the background, and adds a subtle parallax effect, which is what makes the image appear to move as you do. All the magic happens right in Apple's Photos app, so let's start there. Make sure your iPhone is running iOS 26.Launch the Photos app.Browse through your camera roll and find a picture you want to edit.Also: Is iOS 26 draining your iPhone battery faster? Here's why - and what you can doNot every image works well with Spatial Scenes. Look for a photo in your camera roll with a clear subject, like a person, pet, or building. The shots that "pop" the most usually have a strong foreground that stands out from the background. Portrait-style photos, for instance, often have a nice effect.

2. Tap the Spatial Scenes button
Got a photo? Great -- Apple kind of buried the Spatial Scenes button in the photo viewer. It looks like a small hexagon icon, tucked in the top-right corner.With your chosen photo open, locate the Spatial Scenes button (hexagon).Tap it once to activate Spatial Scenes.

3. Tilt your phone
Now here's the fun part -- putting the effect into action.Hold your iPhone in front of you.Slowly tilt or move it side to side.Watch as the subject pops from the background while the background subtly shifts.Also: Don't like Apple's new Liquid Glass look? Here's how to tone it downThe effect is subtle, and not every photo needs it, but with the right ones it can feel dramatic. Avoid blurry shots, since Spatial Scenes doesn't work as well on them, and in my experience, broad landscapes aren't great either. I tried it on some photos of my porch, my husband and me, my pets, and my 4-year-old daughter. What were otherwise pretty basic images suddenly felt much more immersive and interesting. I'm not sure how often I'll use the feature in practice, but it's definitely fun, and I can see myself enabling it on most portrait shots of my loved ones -- just to see the effect.

Elyse Betters Picaro / ZDNETFAQs
How do Spatial Scenes differ from spatial photos and videos?
Spatial Scenes are an AI-powered depth effect that turns 2D photos into dynamic, 3D-like images. They don't require new hardware, because they use AI and software to add depth to any existing photo taken with an iPhone 12 or newer.
Also:Â Why I'm skipping the iPhone 17 this year (and it's not just about the money)Spatial photos and videos, on the other hand, are formats that must be captured with special hardware on the iPhone 16 or newer models -- and you view them in full 3D using an Apple Vision Pro. ZDNET's David Gewirtz reviewed spatial photos and videos last year. Like me, he initially dismissed them as a gimmick, but the experience turned emotional when it "realified" old snapshots of his pets, including a cat he lost decades ago. It wasn't flawless, but it was powerful enough to make him cry.
Can I use Spatial Scenes on the Lock Screen?
Yes. To do so, long-press your Lock Screen, create a new wallpaper, and toggle the Spatial Scenes effect when choosing your photo.
Long-press your Lock Screen until customization options appear.Tap the + button to add a new wallpaper.iOS will suggest compatible photos, or you can pick one manually.On the customization screen, toggle Spatial Scenes on.Preview the effect, then hit Done or Add.Also:Â How to clear your iPhone cache (and why you should do it before the iOS 26 update)
Elyse Betters Picaro / ZDNET Which iPhones support Spatial Scenes? To use Spatial Scenes, you need an iPhone 12 or newer running iOS 26.
Can I share a Spatial Scene?
You can send the photo, but only other iOS 26 devices will display the Spatial Scene effect. On older phones, it'll appear still and flat.
Can I turn off Spatial Scenes on a photo?
Want to restore a Spatial Scene to 2D? Tap the hexagon icon again in Photos to toggle it off.
