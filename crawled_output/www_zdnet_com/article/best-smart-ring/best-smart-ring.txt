Smart rings are a step above smartwatches for their health- and sleep-tracking capabilities. I credit the Oura Ring for helping me further understand the factors that impact sleep and improve my own. Smart rings track everything a smartwatch does -- sleep, activity, and wellness -- all around your finger and without a screen. Plus, they tend to have longer battery life than smartwatches, whose battery only last a day or two at most, so you spend less time charging and more time wearing them.While Oura continues to dominate the smart ring space, brands ranging from newer startups to established companies are throwing their hat -- or rather, their ring -- in the ring. It's never been a more exciting time to put one of these new, high-tech rings on your finger. As ZDNET's smart ring and health wearable editor, I keep my eye on all the notable smart rings entering the space, like the Luna Ring I'm currently testing. These new devices could introduce innovative features and fundamentally shake up the health tech space. Also: Best headphones for sleeping in 2025The best smart rings, like smartwatches, house a comprehensive suite of health and sleep-tracking features. Some, like the Samsung Galaxy Ring, even connect to your phone for functions like photo capture and more.  What's the best smart ring right now? At ZDNET, I've gone hands-on with several top smart rings, spending weeks or months wearing them to test out how their apps, battery life, and other features perform. I also always compare them with other smart rings, wearing two rings at the same time (and even wearing a smartwatch or two on top of that). Our tested pick for the best smart ring overall is the Oura Ring 4, thanks to its impressive health suite, comprehensive health data illustrations, and innovation. But if you aren't willing to spend $350 on a smart ring (and an extra $70 on a subscription), I'd recommend the budget-friendly RingConn Gen 2 Air, which is $200 without a subscription and several helpful health- and sleep-tracking features to boot. Read on to learn more about the perks of the Oura and which other top smart rings are worth considering.

View now at Ouraring At this point in the smart ring race, everyone is trying to beat Oura. But the Oura Ring 4 proves that the smart ring pioneer's position isn't wavering anytime soon. While most smart rings simply provide you with collected health data, the Oura Ring 4 tells you the story and the context behind that data for greater information on your health. Why we like it: What separates the Oura Ring 4 from its competition is its commitment to helpful and actionable health insights that can change or encourage healthy behaviors. As someone who has used the Oura Ring 3 and Oura Ring 4 for over a year, I can attest to the smart ring's health and sleep data illustrations and recommendations that have changed my habits for the better. It doesn't just tell me my sleep or readiness score - it tells me why I got a poor sleep score by showing a graph of when my heart rate dropped that night, and how that drop in heart rate led to a low or high score. Then, it explains how factors like alcohol, exercise, or meal timing influence sleep timing, and thus, sleep and readiness scores. The Oura Ring app's data illustrations provide the right amount of information about my night's sleep, yesterday's activities, and overall stress patterns - and supplement this daily data with long-term trends that can paint a fuller picture of my overall health. Still, the data rarely feels overwhelming, and even on nights when I've gone to bed too late or on days when I'm inactive, the smart ring's nudges and summaries never skew demanding or judgmental. Who's it for: Unlike other smart rings that focus on day-to-day health, the Oura Ring is for people who want to assess both their short-term and long-term overall health. This could be someone managing a health condition or an aging person who wants to detect early signs of strain. For example, its daytime stress data that it collects translates into a long-term resilience status that illustrates how quickly an Oura wearer bounces back from high stress. Through its daily activity information it monitors, you can learn about your long-term cardio capacity and cardiovascular age to get a sense of general heart health. Oura's smart ring (and subsequent monthly subscription) tends to cost more than its competitors because of the constant research and product development, as well as the features that go beyond daily monitoring. So the smart ring will also be best for people who are willing to pay that expensive starting price of $350 (plus the $72 annual subscription). If I could paint the Oura Ring's ideal customer, it would be one who is willing to splurge on a sleep and health-tracking device to regularly check their health data and who is looking for data-driven suggestions and innovative features to improve their overall wellness. It's also got the smallest and largest ring sizes out of all the smart rings on this list, so if a customer hasn't found the right fit in other smart rings, they will probably find a good fit with the Oura Ring. Who should look elsewhere: I'd recommend the Ultrahuman Ring Air if you want similarly innovative health features without the added subscription cost. If you don't need innovative health features to understand your long-term health and just want to check your sleep and readiness score, I'd recommend the Galaxy Ring, which costs a similar price of $350, or the RingConn Gen 2 Air, which costs $200, the cheapest price on this list. Oura Ring Gen 4 tech specs: Material: Lightweight titanium with non-allergenic, non-metallic inner molding | Battery life: Up to 8 days | Charging: Full charge in 20 to 80 minutes | Compatibility: iOS and Android | Durability: Water-resistant up to 328 feet | Sizing: 4 to 15 | FSA and HSA eligible

View now at Samsung The Galaxy Ring is the first smart ring released by a leading tech brand. Samsung released the smart ring last July, and it's a wearable any Android user -- that's right, no iOS compatibility on this ring -- could get excited about.Why we like it: The Galaxy Ring is a great option for Samsung or Android owners. It tracks your sleep, activity, and stress, and delivers that data in a simplistic, easy-to-use format. The Galaxy Ring works best for people already integrated within the Samsung Health ecosystem, who might own a Galaxy Watch to track their activity and want a lighter health tracker for sleep. But the Galaxy Ring isn't only for Samsung users - any Android phone owner can download the Samsung Health app and start using the smart ring. The downside, however, is iPhone owners can't use the smart ring or download the Samsung Health app. It delivers sleep and readiness scores that tend to be higher than other smart ring scores I've received, so it's a great option for people who want to track their slumber or exercises but not feel too bad about the rest they get. Since it pairs with Samsung phones, you can take photos by pinching your ring-wearing finger and thumb together, which is a nice, unique touch. Who's it for: The Galaxy Ring is best for Android users who are already within the Samsung Health ecosystem. Maybe they own a Galaxy Watch and use it for exercise tracking during the day but don't want to wear it to bed. Who should look elsewhere: The Galaxy Ring mainly covers daily health insights and minimal health trends. If you want more long-term health insights, I'd suggest an Oura Ring 4 instead. Review: Samsung Galaxy RingGalaxy Ring tech specs: Material: Titanium | Battery life: Seven days | Sizing: 5 to 13 | Compatibility: Android: | Durability: 10ATM waterproof rating | Charging: Charging case | FSA and HSA eligible

View now at Ultrahuman The Ultrahuman Ring Air offers up a smart ring solution for fitness enthusiasts with features that rival Oura and no subscription. Why we like it: The Ultrahuman Ring Air takes health tracking to another level - it isn't just a sleep or wellness tracker - it's a borderline bio-hacker. If you're into the science behind an optimized, healthy life the Ultrahuman Ring Air is the smart ring for you. From the moment you wake up until the minute you fall asleep, Ultrahuman offers insights into how to get the most out of your day through reminders on when to consume caffeine, expose yourself to sunlight, get up and walk, and wind down.The Ultrahuman Ring Air also offers experimental and innovative features that mimic those of the Oura Ring, namely its Cardio Adaptability feature, which looks a lot like Oura's Cardio Capacity feature. The best part? It's subscription-free, unlike Oura, so you have full access to your data without any additional fee. The ring's readiness and sleep scoring mechanisms appear to be fairly similar to Oura's as well - when I wore both to bed, I constantly got scores within one or two points of each other. Who's it for: Ultrahuman's primary audience is more for hardcore fitness enthusiasts and biohackers looking to mine as much as they can out of their body's energy reserves. These are the types of people who want to optimize their performance in the gym and maximize recovery outside of it. Its secondary audience, however, is someone who is interested in the Oura Ring's innovative features but doesn't want to pay for a monthly subscription for data access. In fact, if you're tired of that Oura Ring subscription, Ultrahuman offers up a trade-in program where you can exchange your Oura Ring (or earlier generation Ultrahuman Ring) for $100 off an Ultrahuman Ring Air. Who should look elsewhere: If you're not a fitness junkie, some of the features - and Ultrahuman's scoring system - may prove a little too intense. For example, when I tested the Ring Air against the Oura Ring, I found that my activity scores were always lower on the Ring Air compared to the Oura. For these reasons, the Ultrahuman Ring Air is made for people who already have a semi-healthy lifestyle and are simply looking to further optimize, rather than an entry-level exerciser seeking encouragement for activity and better rest. The Ultrahuman's battery capacity is one of the shortest on this list. If you want a longer battery life than six days, I'd recommend the RingConn Gen 2 Air with its ten-day battery life instead. Review: Ultrahuman Ring AirUltrahuman Ring Air specs: Sizing: 5-14 | Material: Titanium coated with Tungsten Carbide Carbon | Colors: Matte grey, Aster black, space silver, bionic gold | Water resistance: Up to 330 feet | Sensors: Infrared Photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor, Non-contact medical-grade skin temperature sensor, 6-axis motion sensors, Red LEDs (heart rate monitoring and oxygen saturation) Green LEDs (heart rate monitoring) Infrared LEDs (heart rate monitoring) | Connectivity: Bluetooth Low-Energy | Battery: Up to six days | FSA and HSA eligible

View now at Amazon The RingConn Gen 2 Air is the top smart ring for budget and battery life. Why we like it: Maybe you're just starting your fitness and health journey. Or maybe you don't know how much use you'll get out of a $400 Oura Ring, so you don't want to spend all that money to leave the ring in your jewelry box four months later. The RingConn Gen 2 Air offers a lower-stakes entry point into the world of health and sleep tracking, and the ring delivers lots of the same health metrics and recommendations that are packaged into those higher-priced smart rings. Plus, the smart ring's battery life is the longest on this list at up to ten days, so you won't have to charge it as frequently. Unlike other smart rings on this list, the RingConn Gen 2 Air does not include a readiness or recovery score. Instead, it takes your sleep score, stress/relax status, vitals score, and activity score to generate an overall Wellness Balance. It's a more holistic approach to health and sleep tracking and is best for people who are casual exercisers not looking to optimize their training load with data-driven suggestions, like a readiness or recovery score. Who's it for: Casual exercisers looking to stay active - but maybe not looking for complete training optimization - will reap the benefits of the RingConn Gen 2 Air. The smart ring is a great entry-level health tracker thanks to its affordable price - the cheapest on this list - and its long battery life. It's also a great ring for people who wear a smartwatch during the day and are looking for a smart ring to mainly track their sleep. Who should look elsewhere: The RingConn Gen 2 Air's user interface is not my favorite - it feels bare bones and underdeveloped compared to the other picks on this list. If you want a smart ring with more robust data illustrations, innovative features, and an advanced user interface, I'd recommend the Oura Ring 4 or Ultrahuman Ring Air. Review: RingConn Gen 2RingConn Gen 2 Air Smart Ring tech specs: Material: Titanium | Battery life: 10 days | Sizing: 6 to 14 | Compatibility: iOS and Android: | Durability: IP68 waterproof rating | Charging: Charging case | FSA and HSA eligible

Should I buy a smart ring or a smartwatch?
Here are a few things you might want to consider before buying a smart ring or smartwatch: Battery life: Smart rings tend to have longer battery life than most smartwatches. The average smart ring can run for four to five days without a charge, while a smartwatch like a Pixel Watch, Apple Watch, or Galaxy Watch battery can last a day or two at most.  Comfort: I hate sleeping with my Apple Watch and its chunky screen. But I've never had a problem sleeping with smart rings around my finger. They're far more discreet for everyday activities and don't take up as much real estate on your hands. The only time smartwatches would be more comfortable is during weight training activities, given how the weight could pinch at your finger with a ring on it. Sleep tracking: Because of its longer battery life and more comfortable build, a smart ring is an amazing sleep tracker compared to a smartwatch. I've found that the most useful sleep trackers deliver a sleep score alongside each night of sleep, to give people a visualization of the night's rest. It's worth noting that the Apple Watch, one of the most popular smartwatches on the market, doesn't provide owners with this functionality. Most notable smart rings, however, include a sleep score and comprehensive sleep data in their product. Activity tracking: Smartwatches take the cake when it comes to activity tracking. Unlike a screenless smart ring, smartwatches display key activity metrics like pace, distance, heart rate, and more as someone is running, cycling, walking, and more. This at-a-glance functionality makes smartwatches the true winner for activity tracking. While you can record workouts through a smart ring app, that health data is only available on your phone and oftentimes presented in full once the workout is complete. Style: Style is subjective, yes. But to me, a smart ring has far more potential to look stylish against your other jewelry or outfit than a smartwatch. You can get your smart ring in gold, silver, or black to complement the jewelry tones you tend to wear most. Smart rings dissolve into your wardrobe, while a smartwatch demands more attention and can be an eyesore on a wrist. All in all, depending on what you want from a health wearable, you might choose a smart ring over a smartwatch or vice versa. It's all a matter of which suits the data you'd like to track best and your preferences for comfort, style, and battery life.  Also: Best Android smartwatches: Galaxy Watch Ultra to the Tag Heuer

Factors to consider when choosing a smart ring
If you're interested in purchasing a smart ring, you should consider the following factors: Purpose and functionality: Traditionally, smart rings like the Oura Ring are a substitute for a smartwatch or other health-tracking device. For this list, we considered rings that monitor factors like blood oxygen testing, sleep and heart rate tracking, and activity metrics, but also considered rings with smart nuances, such as NFC readings and making contactless payments. Durability: To go from jewelry accessories to smart staples, there are certain durability aspects these rings should include to maximize benefits. We considered if the rings were waterproof, water-resistant, or coated with any extra protection.Device compatibility: Unlike a smartwatch, smart rings don't have an interactive display. Therefore, all the data is housed via third-party software. We made sure these choices were compatible with iOS and Android.Design: One of the benefits of a smart ring is that, ideally, it's sleek, subtle, and comfortable to wear -- even as your finger may swell in the summer heat.

How we test smart rings
ZDNET went hands-on with every smart ring on this list. We spend a few weeks or months wearing the rings to test out how their apps, battery life, and other relevant features perform -- not just for a day or two, but over the course of many wears and through different environmental conditions. When we think a product is worth your money, we put it on this list and write up a spotlight highlighting its best qualities and specifying who it's for. Also: How we test smart rings at ZDNETPlus, we are constantly scouring the web for new products that are worthy of testing, and following news on product rollouts and upgrades. We know buying an expensive smart ring can set you back a few hundred dollars, and that's why our advice is tailored to your needs and budget and our picks are expert-vetted. To learn more about my process for testing smart rings, visit this article, which covers it in depth.

FAQs on smart rings
Which is the best fitness ring?
Other ZDNET experts also assessed the Oura Ring 4 as the best overall smart ring in the fitness wearable market, especially if your goal is to track exercise and workout recovery specifically. If you aren't interested in the monthly subscription that comes with an Oura Ring, a great alternative fitness ring is the Ultrahuman Ring Air, which, in my opinion, is a sleeper hit fitness ring for anybody who wants to track their diet, get reminders and insights to maximize their energy levels throughout the day, and follow guided workouts, all on the app. This is in tandem with the already amazing health data you get on the Ultrahuman app.

Can the Oura Ring tell if you're sick?
Several stories have circulated recently about wearables like the Oura Ring waving the red flag on a user's health. Just this week, a nurse practitioner's story went viral on TikTok after her Oura Ring notified her of data that eventually led to her receiving a lymphoma diagnosis. Oura's Symptom Radar feature monitors your vitals (your heart rate, heart rate variability, body temperature, and blood oxygen) and notifies you of when there are variations worthy of paying attention to. If it detects major signs of strain, it will encourage you to rest or take a sick day.

Which smart rings sync with Natural Cycles?
The Apple Watch and the Oura Ring are the only two wearables with full Natural Cycles compatibility. The recently released Galaxy Ring, along with the Galaxy Watches, has cycle insights powered by Natural Cycles. However, it doesn't offer the full extent of fertility tracking (or charge you $20 a month, as a Natural Cycles subscription does), meaning you probably wouldn't want to use the Galaxy Ring's cycle insights as a form of contraception.

How long do smart rings last?
Despite how small smart rings are, their battery life can compete with, say, smartwatches. Look for a smart ring that can last up to four to seven days while you're shopping around. If you are paying around $300 for a smart ring, it should last you at least four days, but ideally five or six. The more you have to charge this ring, the less you'll want to wear it and reap the benefits of the health data tracking suite.

View now at Amazon Looking for a discounted smart ring that is just as competitive as the Oura Ring 4? Might I suggest the earlier generation Oura Ring 3 instead? You're getting all of the same software updates as Oura Ring 4 but at a discounted price. The Ring 3 has raised sensor domes that make wearing the device slightly more uncomfortable than the new generation's flat sensors, but if that isn't a concern, I'd suggest saving some money and opting for this ring instead.
