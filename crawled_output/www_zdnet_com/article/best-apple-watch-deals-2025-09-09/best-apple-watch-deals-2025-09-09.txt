Wellness tech is the way of the future, and Apple is an excellent choice for a smartwatch investment. Not only does Apple offer some top features like monitoring health, tracking sleep, and recording workouts, but these watches are a hot buy thanks to their seamless integration with the Apple ecosystem. Users can reply to texts, take calls, and use Apple Pay, all from a wrist. Also: Apple Event live updates 2025: iPhone 17, AirPods 3, Apple Watch Series 11, and more newsIf you're eyeing a watch, we've rounded up our favorite Apple Watch deals on all the latest models -- including discounts, trade-ins, and mobile carrier offers, just as the brand unveiled a new Apple Watch SE 3, Watch 11, and Watch Ultra 3 during its iPhone 17 event on Sept. 9. If you're interested in the latest and greatest Apple Watch tech, save your cash until later in the fall -- that's when we may start seeing discounts on any of the newest models launched today. Here are our favorite deals on the Apple Watch Series 10,  Watch Ultra 2, and Watch SE live now (plus a few of our favorite accessory deals). Shop Apple Watch at AmazonApple Watch Series 10 dealsNew Series 10 watches are on sale at several retailers, though Walmart has the best stock. They are not on sale at Best Buy at the time of publication. Why you'd want to buy one: The Watch Series 10 is still the latest wearable in Apple's midrange lineup. It feaures a thin design, 18 hour battery life, and a larger display than the Series 9, but it isn't as capable as the Ultra 2. It's ZDNET's pick for best Apple watch.

Apple Watch Ultra 2 dealsA new Ultra 2 is not currently on sale at most retailers. Why you'd want to buy one: The Apple Watch Ultra 2 is still the most premium in Apple's lineup. It features a rugged design, a faster S9 processor, a brighter display, and twice the internal storage than the Ultra.

Apple Watch Series 9 dealsNew Series 9 watches are very hard to come by, but there are refurbished and used models available. Why you'd want to buy one: The Watch Series 9 is a great way to get still-premium features for a lower cost thanks to refurbished models. It's more advanced than the base SE model, but not as current as the Watch Series 10. It still offers great battery life, accurate health sensors, and double tap gestures, but doesn't offer blood oxygen tracking.

Apple Watch SE dealsNew Watch SE (2nd Gen) models are available on sale at several retailers. The Watch SE is not on sale at Best Buy at the time of publication. Why you'd want to get one: The Watch SE (2nd Gen) is the base model Apple Watch. It's very affordable, yet still practical. It won't offer advanced features like sleep tracking, but it does grant fall detection, crash detection, and more, and is a great smartwatch for fitness tracking for children, elderly, or first-time smartwatch owners. I have one and still love it.

What are the newest Apple Watch models?The newest Apple Watch models are the Watch SE 3, Watch Series 11, and the Watch Ultra 3, all launched at Apple's 2025 iPhone 17 event. When will new Apple Watches be released?Apple unveiled three new watches during the brand's September 9th iPhone 17 event. A new Watch SE 3, Watch Series 11, and Watch Ultra 3 will be available for preorder starting today and will be available in stores starting Sept. 19. How much do the new Apple Watches cost? The new Watch SE 3 starts at $249, the Watch Series 11 starts at $399, and the Watch Ultra 3 starts at $799. What are the new features? Check out ZDNET's Apple Event live blog for minute-by-minute updates as well as a recap of the Sept. 9 event. Apple Watch Series 11: The Apple Watch Series 11 will be the first of the wearable line to support 5G connectivity. It also features several new watch faces, including Flow (based on Liquid Glass, the design aesthetic used across iOS 26) and "Exactograph," a unique design that separates hours, minutes, and seconds.The Apple Watch Series 11 uses the optical blood sensor to track and review data over a 30-day period to find signs of hypertension. Apple says it's expecting FDA clearance "soon." Plus, Apple Watch Series 11 now has Sleep Scores, which analyzes how you sleep using complex algorithms. The Apple Watch Series 11 can last up to 24 hours, comes in Jet Black, Rose Gold, and Space Gray, and is made with 100% aluminum. Apple Watch SE 3: Apple launched its third-generation Apple Watch SE. It features the S10 chip that supports a new always-on display. You can play music directly through the speaker. The Apple Watch SE also features an 18-hour battery life and fast charging for the first time -- in 15 minutes of fast charging, users can get up to eight hours of normal use. It is compatible with iOS 26, which opens it up to advanced features on par with the rest of the lineup too.Apple Watch Ultra 3: The new Watch Ultra 3 features a new display that uses a wide-angle OLED and LTPO 3, making it brighter to view. Apple says the bezels are thinner, too, allowing the watch to have a larger screen within the same body as last year. Like the Watch Series 11, Ultra 3 supports 5G connectivity. But it goes a step further by using satellites for emergency messages, pings. and Find My syncing. The Watch Ultra 3 can last up to 42 hours, the longest rating of any Apple Watch.
