MagSafe accessories like MagSafe wallets can upgrade our phones from basic to better. When our phones need a battery boost, most of us can't stay tethered to a wall outlet. Thankfully, with MagSafe battery packs, you don't have to. The battery market is packed with options that can boost your phone's battery life on the go. From portable power banks to wireless charging stations, there's something for everyone. I've personally tested over a dozen MagSafe battery packs from brands like Torras and Baseus, evaluating factors like design, function, and value. I've also selectively incorporated other picks based on ZDNET expert reviews and evaluations. Get more in-depth ZDNET tech coverage: Add us as a preferred Google source on Chrome and Chromium browsers.What's the best MagSafe battery pack right now? Right now, our pick for the best overall MagSafe battery pack is the Anker Nano MagGo 5K Slim power bank due to its practical design and ultra-sleek size. Should you prefer the skinniest yet comparable pack, the Torras MiniMag is a personal favorite. In addition, the Zendure Supermini Q or Benks ArmorGo 10K Qi2 battery packs are great options for those who need more power on the go. I, and other ZDNET experts, went hands-on with several of the top MagSafe battery packs, including every pick on this list.

View now at Belkin I really liked the first iteration of this battery pack and included it on this list over the last several months. I like the newly upgraded Qi2 version even more. This new model has the USB-C connector on the side instead of the bottom of the pack, clearer indicator lights and a tad slimmer build. Why we like it: Simply put, this pack works great. Its secure grip and competitive battery speak for themselves. I took this pack to a Yankees game, several late-night outings, work, and even on errands, and I am impressed with the charging. You can expect between a 25-30% battery boost in about an hour to your phone. It also comes with a built-in stand that easily swings in and out. Who's it for: Someone looking for a no-fuss, practical battery pack that doesn't mind a bit of bulk. This battery isn't packed with extra bells or whistles, and it doesn't come in fun colors like it used to.Also: My new favorite MagSafe battery pack supports Qi2 charging, has a kickstand, and isn't made by Anker or BaseusWho should look elsewhere: If you're looking to use a MagSafe battery pack for longer chargers, you'll want a larger capacity pack. If you want a bit more personality or other colors, you'll also want to check out other brands. Apple used to exclusively sell colored iterations of this pack, but it seems to no longer be available. However, Belkin carries the black and white iterations as well as the 8K and 10K models. Belkin Boostcharge Pro Qi2 Magnetic Power Bank 5K specs: Capacity: 5,000mAh | Charging Port: USB-C | Power button: Yes

View now at Amazon When using a MagSafe battery pack to charge your phone, a mild warming of your device and the battery is to be expected, but it shouldn't be hot to the touch. If you're worried about overheating, the Sharge Icemag 2 is designed to stay cool while charging.Why we like it: Expert Jack Wallen loved this 10,000mAh battey pack for bolstering his Google Pixel 9. "With a perfect size, a powerful battery, RBG lighting, and a tiny fan to keep things cool, this power bank is ideal for those on the go," Wallen said in his review. Wallen noted that the strong magnets on the Sharge battery prevent it from slipping off, and the built-in kickstand is perfect for propping up his phone. But the best part is the Sharge Icemag's cooling feature. Who's it for: The MagSage user looking for a cooling battery pack option for their Android or Apple device. "The Icemag 2 includes a tiny fan to keep the charger from getting hot, and it does a good job with that task. Hold your finger next to the vent, and you will actually feel warm air escape ... while I did find the Pixel 9 Pro did get a bit warm, it wasn't anything to be concerned about," Wallen said. Also: I found a MagSafe battery pack that works flawlessly with my Pixel 9 Pro - and its seriously impressiveWho should look elsewhere: Though the Icemag 2 is great for keeping a cool battery booster, Wallen said it isn't the fastest charging power bank on the market, though he surmised it would charge an iPhone faster than his Pixel. If you're looking for quick charging or a smaller battery capacity option, you'll want to look elsewhere.Sharge Icemag 2 features: Built-in kickstand | Built-in fan to prevent pack overheating | Strong magnetic hold | 10,000mAh battery capacity | Works with Android and iPhone

View now at Amazon If you're in the market for a compact, wireless, and travel-friendly charging setup, or something to curb those cords at home -- this is it. The Anker MagGo 3-1 Wireless Charging Station has a compact form factor, one comparable to a deck of cards, while still being able to charge multiple devices simultaneously with impressive speed. Why we like it: The Anker MagGo Wireless Charging Station leverages Qi2 technology to snap onto the back of your iPhone and delivers 15W fast charging. In addition, it has a retractable arm to set your Apple Watch and a pad for your AirPods or any earbuds that are compatible with wireless charging. Who's it for: Apple users looking for an easy and travel-friendly way to charge their ecosystem, including the Apple Watch, iPhone, and AirPods. When ZDNET's Sabrina Ortiz tested it earlier this year, it boosted her iPhone 14 from 40% to 60% in just 30 minutes. Ortiz also found that the charger steadily charged her multiple devices relatively evenly when 3-in-1 charging was used. Also: I found a Qi2 charging station that can do it all (and Apple users will love it)Who should look elsewhere: If you're looking for just a MagSafe battery pack, consider other options on this list. If you don't need a multi-charger or travel charger, or don't own an Apple Watch, you can probably skip out on this one. Anker MagGo 3-1 Wireless Charging Station features: 3-in-1 charging | 15W fast charging | Compact (folds to the size of a baseball) | USB-C connectivity

Factors to consider when choosing a MagSafe battery pack:
If you're looking to purchase a MagSafe battery pack, there a few things to keep in mind.Charging efficiency: Most power bank companies claim that your phone should last more than a day with 5,000mAh. Therefore, battery packs within the 5,000-20,000mAh range are likely best for most people's needs.Pass-through charging capabilities: Chances are it's not only your phone that could benefit from some battery but a whole device ecosystem. Pass-through charging allows other connected devices to charge simultaneously. Portability: A battery pack won't do you any good if you can't take it on the go. Consider options that are sleek, compact, and don't weigh you down. Use: It will be easier to select a MagSafe battery that works for your lifestyle if you spend some time thinking about where you'll be using it and when. On the train to work? While you're walking out and about? Just at home? Just in case of an emergency? Asking yourself these types of questions may help you narrow down what factors, such as size, charging capabilities, and charging rate, are most important to you. Price: Phones are expensive enough, so your battery pack doesn't need a hefty price tag to match. Consider budget-friendly options with a quality charge and decide how much you're willing to spend to juice up your phone on the go.

How did we test these MagSafe battery packs?
ZDNET went hands-on with all of the MagSafe battery packs on this list. We affixed these packs to our own smartphones during our daily lives to test out recharge rate, magnetic strength, pass-through capabilities, comfort, and more. We used them over the course of a few weeks to really get a feel for a product's add-in value. That is, can you "add-in" this product into your life and benefit from its presence, or is it just another fad product that's too good to be true or collects dust after the buzz wears off? If we think another product is worth your money, we'll update this list or write up a spotlight review highlighting its best qualities and specifying who it's for. Plus, we are routinely scouring the web for new products that are worthy of testing, and following news on product rollouts and upgrades, and sourcing the best deals. We know buying anything in the current economy is not just for your whims, and that's why this list, as well as our other advice, is tailored to your needs, wants, and your budget and why our picks are expert-tested and expert-vetted.

Latest info on MagSafe battery packs in 2025President Donald Trump's new economic plan could shake up global tech manufacturing -- potentially hitting consumers the hardest. Imports from some countries may decrease in availability and increase in cost more than others. It may be time to take note of products you were looking to buy in the next few months and accelerate your purchasing timeline.Small tech accessories like chargers, cables, adapters, and MagSafe gear will not necessarily be immune to the current economic times. Many accessories utilize imported metals and materials. However, accessories like MagSafe gear will likely still remain "affordable" in comparison to larger tech products like laptops and iPhones that are more likely to see bigger cost increases. Right now, it looks like some tech may be exempt from the issued tariffs, but since it's always changing and developing, we are keeping an eye on it and will update you on the latest.Also: Tariff exemptions for electronics offer a break for tech - but not for longMagSafe battery pack FAQs

Can I take a MagSafe battery on a plane?
Yes, you can bring a MagSafe battery on a plane. According to the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), portable chargers or power banks containing a lithium ion battery must be packed in carry-on bags. Spare lithium batteries, which include both power banks and phone chargers, are prohibited in checked luggage. For more information, including specific size, capacity, and model limitations, see the FAA guidance on portable rechargers. Also: Southwest has new rule that changes how you charge your phone mid-flightSome airlines, like Southwest have recently implemented policies that require passengers to keep portable chargers and other lithium charging devices out in the open while charging in the cabin to help limit and control potential fires or accidents. Southwest confirmed the new policy to Business Insider at the end of May and are the first US airline to do so. Similarly, China's aviation regulator just introduced a ban on uncertified power banks aboard domestic flights, citing safety concerns linked to lithium battery fires. These new rules came into effect on July 5, 2025, and restrict passengers from carrying power banks without the valid China Compulsory Certification (3C) markings or with unclear labels, as well as any models subject to recent product recalls, Travel and Leisure reported.

Should I get a power bank or a MagSafe battery pack?
The answer to this question ultimately depends on your needs. Let's walk through it. A power bank can technically have MagSafe capabilities, and some MagSafe battery packs offer dual charging, but not all offerings are the same. Traditionally, a power bank refers to products without MagSafe capabilities, ones that rely on a lightning or USB-C cord to charge your iPhone and that cannot be affixed to your phone with a magnetic grip. These are great options for road trips, emergency charging situations such as power outages, or to store as a "just-in-case" item in your car, work bag, or home. On the other hand, MagSafe battery packs offer charging via magnetic grip. Most of these battery packs can be attached to your phone, making them perfect for air travel, commuting, and everyday activities. They also do not require a cord for charging, though some MagSafe battery packs can be used, like a battery pack with a cord. What's a better buy for you will depend on where and when you want to juice up your iPhone, so I recommend really thinking about how your backup battery needs to function in your day-to-day life to be worth your money.
