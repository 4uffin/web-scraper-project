When is October Prime Day 2025? This year, Amazon's October Prime Day sale runs on Oct. 7-8. The sale will last for two days, and you can expect to see a range of deals on electronics, homeware, garden products, fashion, and more. Are Sam's Club deals really cheaper on Prime Day? The US retailer is likely to launch its own deals or at least price match some of the sales, although this may only include Sam's Club members. Still, it's worth keeping an eye on for interesting promotions. How did we choose these October Prime Day deals?ZDNET authors only write about deals that interest us personally and include products that we own or want to buy. Our experts scour the market for deals that are at least 20% off (or are normally not on sale, as is often the case with Apple and other high-end devices), using established price comparison tools and trackers to determine whether the deal actually represents value for your money. We also looked over customer reviews to find out what matters to real people who already own and use the deals we're recommending.
