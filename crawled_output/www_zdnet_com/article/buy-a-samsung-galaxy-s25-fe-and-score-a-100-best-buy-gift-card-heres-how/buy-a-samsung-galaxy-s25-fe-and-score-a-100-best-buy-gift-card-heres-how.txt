2/5 Editor's deal rating View at Best Buy With fall officially in the air, now is the perfect time to upgrade your devices (and maybe get something extra). Luckily, Best Buy is offering a great deal on the new Samsung Galaxy S25 FE; one of our favorite Samsung phones available. Right now, if you buy the Galaxy S25 FE online, you'll automatically get a free $100 Best Buy e-gift card added to your cart -- which essentially discounts the cost of the phone itself. Also: The best smartphones of 2025Of course, the phone's price varies with each phone carrier, but utilizing this deal means you can potentially score a new, unlocked Galaxy S25 FE for only $650 + a free $100 gift card. This promotion also includes one free month of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate membership, so gamers should take note.

Samsung Galaxy S25 FE for $650 + free $100 e-gift card
View at Best Buy Expert Sabrina Ortiz reviewed (and loved) the Samsung Galaxy S25 FE. The phone's numerous upgrades from the S24 FE include even more enhanced Galaxy AI features like Now Brief, which gives summaries and suggestions for each day's events, like navigation recommendations and calendar reminders. Also: Get this Samsung TV on sale and get a year of ESPN Unlimited for freeThe AI features also work well with the S25 FE's cameras (including a 12MP sensor for the selfie camera) via a generative edit feature, which suggests distracting images to remove from the background of your photo. It also allows you to erase or adjust various sounds in your videos and automatically trim them to highlight the unmissable moments.
The S25 FE camera in action.  Sabrina Ortiz/ZDNETThe Galaxy S25 FE also has an improved Exynos 2400 chipset with a faster CPU clock speed and a larger 4,900mAh battery, which means quicker charging and better battery life. Despite the larger battery, the S25 FE is 23g lighter and .6mm slimmer than the S24 model. Also: I tried the Samsung Galaxy S25 FE, and it got big upgrades in several waysThe Samsung Galaxy S25 FE price varies depending on your cellphone carrier via Best Buy, but the cost to buy the phone unlocked starts at $650. The gift card automatically applies to your cart when you add the phone. Many S25 FE models also come with a free month-long Xbox Game Pass Ultimate membership, so keep an eye out for that while you shop. With your gift card, you can grab accessories for your new smartphone. We've tested and reviewed other Samsung products, like the Galaxy Buds 3 and the Galaxy Ring, which would be perfect companions to your new S25 FE.

Get expert reviews and editor favorites with ZDNET Recommends.How I rated this deal Any way you slice it, a $100 e-gift card is an excellent add-on to any purchase. Still, I gave this deal a 2/5 rating because even at the lowest starting price available for the Samsung Galaxy S25 FE ($650), a $100 discount via the e-gift card only cuts 15% of the overall cost. I do still think the deal is worth pursuing, especially if you were considering buying the phone anyway. Plus, the gift card can be put towards accessories for your new device.
