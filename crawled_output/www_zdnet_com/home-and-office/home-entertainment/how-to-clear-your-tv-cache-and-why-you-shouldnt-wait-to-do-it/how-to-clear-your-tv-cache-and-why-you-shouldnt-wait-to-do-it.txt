Adam Breeden/ZDNETFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.In the age of smart TVs, convenience is king. With just a few clicks, we can dive into endless entertainment -- but that ease comes with a downside: the buildup of cache data. Also: How to disable ACR on your TV (and why doing so makes such a big difference)Just like on your phone or computer, a cluttered TV cache can lead to sluggish performance, app crashes, and even hinder new content from loading properly. That's why it's important to clear all that extra cache and make your TV feel like new again. Before I break down the steps for how to do it, let's address the big elephant in the room first.
What is a cache? A cache is a temporary storage area where data is kept for quick access. On your smart TV, the cache stores information from apps, websites, and system processes to help them load faster every time you turn it on. Think of it as a bunch of temporary files intended to speed up loading times for frequently accessed information.
Also: The best TVs of 2025: Expert tested and reviewedFor instance, when you open a streaming app, the cache might store thumbnails, login details, or recently watched shows. Caches are designed to help your TV load this content more quickly. Over time, however, the cache can become overloaded with outdated or unnecessary data, which can consequently slow down your TV's performance.
Why should you clear your TV's cache? You should consider clearing your TV's cache for two main reasons. First, it can improve performance. A bloated cache can slow down your TV's processing, leading to sluggish navigation, delayed app launches, and buffering issues. Clearing the cache frees up space and allows your TV to run more efficiently. Second, clearing the cache can resolve app-specific problems. If you're experiencing issues like crashes, login errors, or unexpected behavior within a particular app, clearing the cache for that specific app can often be the fix. Also: The best Sony TVs of 2025: Expert testedThe process of clearing your TV's cache will vary depending on the brand and model you own, although the general steps are usually quite similar across brands. Most TVs will have a settings menu where you can navigate to an "Apps" section. Here, you should find a list of all downloaded applications. Selecting an individual app will often reveal options to "Clear Cache" or "Clear Data." Clearing the cache will remove temporary files, while clearing data will erase all app information, requiring you to log in again. It's generally recommended to start with clearing the cache and only resort to clearing data if the problem persists. Also: I changed 10 settings on my Fire TV to instantly improve the performanceIf you're unsure about the specific steps for your TV, a quick online search for your model and "clear cache" should provide you with detailed instructions. Most manufacturers also offer user manuals or online support resources that can guide you through the process. Clearing your TV's cache can offer several benefits:
Improved performance: Over time, cached data can accumulate and
slow down your TV's operations. Increased storage space: Clearing the cache frees up valuable
storage space on your TV. Resolved app issues: Sometimes, apps may malfunction due to
corrupted cached data. Clearing the cache can often fix these problems. Enhanced privacy: Cached data may contain personal information,
so regular clearing can help protect your privacy.  How do I clear the cache on my TV? The process of clearing your TV's cache can vary depending on the brand and model. However, here's a general guide that applies to many smart TVs: Access the Settings menu on your TV.Navigate to the Apps or Application Manager section.Select the app for which you want to clear the cache.Look for an option that says "Clear Cache" and select
it.Below is a list of specific cache-clearing instructions for some leading brands.
For Samsung TVs: Go to Settings > Support > Device CareSelect "Manage Storage"Choose the app you want to clear the cache for and select
"View Details"Select "Clear Cache"Also: 5 easy ways to instantly improve your soundbar's audio (without spending a dime) For LG TVs: Press the Home button on your remoteGo to Settings > General > StorageSelect "Clear Cache" For Android/Google TVs (including Sony models): Go to Settings > AppsSelect "See all apps"Choose the app you want to clear the cache forSelect "Clear Cache" For Roku TVs: Roku TVs don't have a built-in cache-clearing option, but you can achieve similar results by restarting the TV or removing and reinstalling problematic apps. Also: Is your Roku TV spying on you? Likely, but here's how you can take back controlSome key points to note:
The exact menu names and options may vary slightly between TV models and software versions.You may need to clear the cache for individual apps rather than the entire system on some TVs.Clearing your cache is generally safe and won't delete important data, but clearing app data may reset some settings.Be sure to consult your TV's user manual for model-specific instructions, as the process can differ between brands and even between models of the same brand. When should you clear your TV's cache? While there's no strict rule, it's a good practice to clear your TV's cache every few months or when you notice:
Your TV is running slower than usual.Apps are frequently crashing or not loading properly.You're running low on storage space.Also: Can't hear TV dialogue? Changing these 3 settings can make a big differenceTaking a few minutes to clear your cache is a simple yet often overlooked task that can improve your smart TV's performance and ensure a smooth viewing experience. By making this a regular part of your TV maintenance routine, you can enjoy faster load times, more stable app performance, and potentially even extend the life of your device. With a clean slate, your TV can operate smoother, apps can function properly, and you can get back to enjoying your favorite content without any frustrating glitches. More how-tos
