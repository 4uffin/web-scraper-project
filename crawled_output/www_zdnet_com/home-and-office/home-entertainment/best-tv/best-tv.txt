What is the right TV for you?
After determining your budget, it's important to ensure that your new TV will fit comfortably in your space. Start by measuring the distance (in inches) between your couch and where the TV will be wall-mounted or placed on a stand. Divide that number in half to find the ideal TV size for your room. For example, if your couch is 120 inches (10 feet) away from your TV, the recommended TV size for your room would be about 60 inches. Additionally, it's a good idea to consider accessibility features such as voice controls, screen readers, and closed captioning to ensure that everyone can enjoy the entertainment. These features can provide an enhanced viewing experience for those who are hearing or visually impaired, and they can be especially helpful for households with young children or elderly family members.

Factors to consider when choosing a TV
While shopping for a new TV for your home theater or a second screen for your bedroom, there are a few factors to keep in mind:Brand integrity: While it's tempting to snap up that ultra-cheap TV from a smaller or unknown brand in order to save money, you may end up paying more in the long run. And you could run into customer service issues when trying to make a return or troubleshoot an issue. Each TV on this list was chosen from a trusted brand with verified customer service options.Smart features: Customers have come to expect smart features like streaming apps and virtual assistants as-standard in their TVs. Each model on this list was chosen because it offers a host of features like preinstalled streaming apps, virtual assistant support, and Wi-Fi connectivity.Reasons to upgrade: Brands may release model updates almost yearly, but they don't always give you a real reason to upgrade. Each TV we chose offers upgraded panels, brighter pictures, and in some cases better online security.

How we test TVs
While testing and researching the TVs featured on this list, I and other ZDNET experts kept these criteria in mind:Price: Not all budgets are created equal. And if you're working with a limited budget, that shouldn't mean you have to settle for a sub-par TV. Each TV model on this list has been chosen across a variety of price points to help accommodate different needs.Screen size: The most important factor to consider, after price, when shopping for a new TV is whether or not it will fit into your space. Each best TV on this list was chosen because they are available in a wide variety of sizes to suit different rooms.Picture and audio quality: A new TV doesn't mean much, even if it costs an arm and a leg, if it doesn't provide a great picture and clear audio. Each TV on this list has been ensured to support various HDR codecs, including HDR10+ and Dolby Vision, as well as enhanced audio software like Dolby Atmos, Dolby Digital Plus, and object-tracking sound.For a more detailed look, check out our extensive TV testing methodology.

Latest news on TVsBig brands like LG, Samsung, and Sony have all released or announced yearly refreshes to their TV lineups with improved OLED, QLED, and Mini LED panels for better color accuracy, brightness, and contrast. Smaller brands like TCL and Hisense also announced lineup refreshes with enhanced picture and audio quality.FAQs on TVs
Which is better: Roku or Android TVs?
IT depends on your personal preference. Both platforms have pros and cons. Roku TVs tend to be some of the most affordable on the market while still providing a great streaming experience via a suite of preloaded, popular apps. Roku TVs also have a simplified home menu with your most-used apps and HDMI-connected devices in one easy-to-navigate hub, so you never have to scroll through confusing menus or memorize input locations. The downside? They often don't have native voice control or support for Dolby Atmos and Dolby Vision. Android-based televisions are a bit more expensive, but you get more features, like built-in voice controls, Bluetooth connectivity, support for variable refresh rate technology, as well as Dolby Vision HDR and Dolby Atmos sound processing. When comparing Roku and Android-based TVs, consider your must-have features so you can choose the model that best fits your needs and budget.

What size TV do I need?
The best way to find your ideal TV screen size is to measure the distance (in inches) between your couch and where the TV will be wall-mounted or placed on a dedicated stand. Next, divide that distance by two. So if your couch is 120 inches (10 feet) from where the TV will be, the ideal size would be 60 inches. You can always go a bit bigger or smaller depending on your budget and what's available, but you don't want to go wild and get a huge screen if you don't need to. Not only do you run the risk of having your new, expensive TV not fit your space, but a screen that's too big can overwhelm a room and even cause motion sickness. On the other end of the spectrum, while smaller screens tend to be more affordable, a TV that's too small for a room can make the space feel cavernous and force everyone to crowd around in order to see.

Is it worth buying an 8K TV?
As of right now, we're inclined to say no. Not only are 8K televisions very expensive, but there isn't any 8K content available over broadcast, streaming, or gaming outlets to justify buying one. A conservative estimate would say that 8K streaming and gaming will be available within the next five years or so, and it will require a very fast internet connection to handle the bandwidth needed to stream consistently in ultra-high definition. If you've always been an early adopter of tech, want to get a jump on future-proofing your home theater, and have extra cash to spend, you might get more value out of an 8K television than someone who just wants to watch Succession on HBO Max.If you're looking for an 8K panel, I personally recommend checking out the Samsung QN900C. I had a chance to check it out, and during my initial testing, I really, truly enjoyed the display.

What's the difference between OLED and QLED?
OLED and QLED panel types use the same basic components to create images on screen: a power source, a light source, and a color source. The key differences are exactly how these panels get power, light, and color. A QLED screen, mostly seen in Samsung, TCL, and Hisense models, uses a modified LED panel and a "quantum dot" screen to create images. The "quantum" in QLED seems to be more of a catchy marketing term than an allusion to actual quantum tech, but it does give you enhanced color and detailing over a regular LED display. An OLED panel, found in LG, Sony, and Vizio TVs, uses an array of mini LED lamps that are individually lit along with organic substrates for color. The individual LEDs allow for true blacks to create stunning contrast and make colors pop. It's an expensive technology to produce, so OLED TVs are pretty pricey. But if picture quality is your top priority, it's a worthwhile investment.

Do I need a soundbar or can I rely on the TV's built-in speakers?
It really depends on your preferences and the TV model you choose. Some TVs have excellent built-in speakers that provide ample sound quality for most viewers, while others may benefit from a separate soundbar or audio system for a more immersive audio experience. If you're a movie or gaming enthusiast, you may want to consider investing in a soundbar or dedicated audio system to complement your TV.Also: The best soundbars
