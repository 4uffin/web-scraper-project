picture alliance/Contributor/picture alliance via Getty ImagesFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.ZDNET's key takeawaysYouTube has new AI generation tools for Shorts creators.The tools let you create and edit with AI.Content generated with these tools will be marked as AI.More AI is coming to YouTube.In a blog post today, YouTube detailed several new AI-powered tools designed specifically for Shorts creators -- billing them as "a suite of features designed to make creativity on YouTube more playful and effortless than ever." Also: YouTube is using AI to verify your age now - and if it's wrong, that's on you to fixYouTube says it has partnered with Google DeepMind to bring a custom version of its Veo 3 video generation model to YouTube. Veo 3 Fast works seamlessly in YouTube Shorts, the company explained, generating videos with lower latency at 480p. This means you can easily create video clips (for the first time with sound) from any idea.Veo 3 Fast is rolling out now. You'll find it by tapping the sparkle icon that appears while creating a video.New Veo editing capabilitiesYouTube also says that it's rolling out new Veo-powered capabilities for Shorts. You'll have three new ways to get creative:Add motion to a photo: You can now bring photos to life by capturing and transferring movement from one subject to another -- like a dance or a sports move.Stylize your video: Add new styles, like pop art or origami, to give your footage a totally different look with a tap.Add objects: Add objects like characters, props, or effects with a simple text description. For instance, YouTube says, you can add a rubber duck to your morning coffee or a giant octopus coming to capsize a ship in the harbor.
YouTubeIn one video showcasing the feature, a user adds a karate movement to a straightforward photo. The person in the photo springs to life, unleashing a flurry of realistic-looking moves. In another video, a user enters a text prompt of "a photorealistic octopus on a New York City sidewalk plays drums on buckets as pedestrians walk by." After showcasing the newly musical mollusc, you also see a seal baking a pizza, a skunk spraying graffiti, a peacock pecking at an ATM, a hedgehog typing a poem, and other adorable animal residents.Also: Adobe Premiere's new iPhone app lets you edit videos on the go - and it's totally freeTo utilize these tools, tap the sparkle icon in the top right corner as you're creating your Short. These capabilities will start to roll out over the next few months. A quicker start and a catchy tuneYouTube is also making it easier to get started. Edit with AI is a new feature that takes your raw camera roll footage and makes a "compelling first draft." YouTube explains that the feature intelligently finds and arranges your best moments, adds music and transitions, and even creates a voiceover that can react to what's happening in the video. Edit with AI
will be available in the coming weeks.Also: How to turn your Google Photos into videos in seconds - it's free and so much funLastly, Speech to Song takes dialogue and remixes it into a catchy tune. (You can see it in action here.) Using Lyria 2, Google DeepMind's most advanced AI music model, this feature takes words from your eligible videos and turns them into songs you and others can use for a Short. You can even choose the vibe of your song, such as chill, danceable, or fun. YouTube noted that all of these features will utilize SynthID watermarks and content labels to indicate that it's AI-generated content.Featured
