Own a PS5? I changed 3 quick settings to give my console a huge performance boost
With a few tweaks, you can noticeably improve your PS5 experience - across gaming, streaming, or even your online security.

Charlie Osborne/ZDNETFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.ZDNET's key takeawaysFew quick changes can help your PS5 run more efficiently and last longer.You'll notice smoother visuals and sharper colors across games.Built-in privacy controls give you more protection while you're online.I consider myself a casual gamer at best, but I love my PlayStation 5. It's my primary entertainment hub, where I can bypass the ad-laden cable subscription (insidiously built into my apartment's rent) in favor of watching streaming platforms. And the PS5 supports some of the most talked-about video games in the industry.Also: How much RAM do you really need in 2025? I broke it down for Mac and Windows usersThe PS5 comes with sophisticated default settings, yet not every one of them is necessarily ideal for your purposes or best use. So, whether you're gaming or viewing media through your PlayStation console, here are some things to consider, with detailed steps to make things run smoother and more safely.
1. Conserving your DualSense controller's battery life
A common complaint among users is that the PS5's DualSense controller doesn't hold a charge very long when unplugged. However, you can make several changes to extend its wireless functionality.In Settings (the gear icon in the upper right corner), go to Accessories > Controller (General) > Controller Indicators Brightness and change the setting to Dim. Thenfind Trigger Effect Intensity as well as Vibration Intensity and switch them from Standard to Weak. (If you're ok with having no haptic feedback at all, you can turn both these settings entirely Off.) Also: 4 PC parts I'm buying to upgrade my computer (and the 7 I'm keeping)Toward the bottom of the menu, you'll see Controller Speaker. Adjust the slider bar to the left for minimal output. You can also access this through Sound > Volume.Finally, if you're not gaming and instead watching video content, then your DualSense is needlessly burning energy. Go to System > Power Saving > Set Time Until Controllers Turn Off, and select After 10 Minutes.

2. Optimizing your screen and video output settings
If your TV supports VRR, 120Hz Output, and ALLM, these features should be enabled. Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) eliminates screen tearing and stuttering by dynamically adjusting your TV's refresh rate to match a game or movie production's frame rate for a cleaner visual experience. ALLM (Auto Low Latency Mode) essentially reduces input lag, making your actions with the controller appear on the screen faster.Follow this path: Settings > Screen and Video > Video Output and set VRR to Automatic. Also, enable Apply to Unsupported Games.While still on the Video Output submenu, you'll see options for ALLM and 120Hz Output. Change both of these to Automatic. Your TV will need to support HDMI 2.1 for these features to work, and the PS5 will tell you right away if your TV does not qualify.Also: The best TVs for PS5 of 2025: Expert tested and reviewedScrolling further down, you'll find HDR (High Dynamic Range) for which you want to be sure Always On is selected. Just below that, Adjust HDR offers an opportunity to run a swift wizard that calibrates your display for colors, brightness, and black levels. Use the controller to pick Brighter or Darker in order to make an on-screen symbol barely visible. (This will make sense when you try it.)Two more color settings appear at the bottom of this menu: Deep Color Output and RGB Range. Make sure these are both set to Automatic.

3. Protecting your online visibility and personal data
To help protect your privacy while using your PS5, you can customize certain settings to control what information is visible to others, restrict who can communicate with you, and manage your account security. This includes limiting who can see your online status, gaming history, and profile information, as well as controlling access to your account and console. Under Settings, head to Users and Accounts > Privacy > View and Customize Your Privacy Settings. Here, you can control who can see your real name, profile picture, friends list, game activity and history, and who can send friend requests or interact with you online. For each of the variables in this menu, I recommend choosing "No One" and "Close Friends Only." This should significantly reduce unwanted friend requests or spam.Also: How to clear your TV cache (and why you shouldn't wait to do it)If you're like me, you don't feel a need to infuse Sony's database with more personal information than required, such as the voice data collected through your DualSense controller's microphone.Under Privacy, scroll down to "Control how your data is collected and used" to access three options: Data You Provide, Personalization, and Voice Data Collection. For the former (Data You Provide), change the setting to Limited. For Personalization, I recommend turning off all four of the sub-options, including Standard Personalization. For the latter, switch to Don't Allow for Voice Data Collection.

Bottom line The PlayStation 5 offers dozens of customizable settings that can tailor your gaming and viewing experience to your particular preferences. You could spend an hour roving through the Settings menu to experiment with various options, tweaking them to your liking.
I've found these three factors to be most essential in getting the best out of the console while safeguarding my personal information. Featured
