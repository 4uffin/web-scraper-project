Thinking about cutting the cord, but still want to watch live news, sports, and shows? We're here to help. Platforms like YouTube TV and Hulu+ Live TV allow you to watch live channels -- plus their own exclusive content -- for a fraction of the cost of traditional cable. With live TV streaming services, you don't need to deal with additional equipment and lengthy setup phone calls. You can also watch live programs from your TV, phone, laptop, or tablet. Also: The best TV antennas: Expert testedWhat is the best live TV streaming service right now?I've been testing streaming services for years, for both our sister site CNET and ZDNET. My pick for the best overall live TV streaming service is YouTube TV due to its wide channel selection, unlimited DVR, and add-on options for even more channels and networks.

View now at YouTube TV YouTube TV is my pick for the overall best live TV streaming service due to its unlimited DVR and more than 100 channels including AMC, Bravo, CBS, FX, NBA TV, Disney Channel, and Nickelodeon. My family subscribes to YouTube TV largely because it's the only streaming service that offers NFL Sunday Ticket -- a package for watching out-of-market Sunday afternoon football games for an additional cost. This add-on is the one to consider for every football fan gearing up for next season. With the multiview feature, you can watch up to four channels on the same screen, so you'll never miss a game, even if two are scheduled simultaneously.You can tack on Max, Starz, Showtime, and more sports networks for an extra fee. For an additional $10 a month, you can add 4K viewing to certain content, enjoy unlimited simultaneous streams at home, and watch recorded content offline. The biggest downside is the price, which recently jumped from $73 to $83 a month. In comparison, Hulu (With Ads) + Live TV costs the same, and also includes access to Hulu, Disney+, and ESPN+.If you're looking for the widest selection of channels -- and/or NFL Sunday ticket -- and don't mind the price tag, YouTube TV is an excellent live TV streaming service. YouTube TV features: Channels: 100+ | Plan options: 1 | Video storage: Unlimited | Price: Starts at $83 per month

View now at Sling TV If you're on a budget, Sling TV is my pick for the best TV streaming service with affordable options to tailor the service to the channels you actually watch. Sling TV offers two plans. Orange is $40 a month and offers seven channels like Disney Channel and ESPN. Blue costs $45 a month and offers local channels including ABC, Fox, and NBC, as well as 14 more premium cable channels like FX, Bravo, NFL Network, and FS1. Both plans include 25 base channels like AMC, CNN, Comedy Central, TBS, and TNT, and you have the option to combine both plans for just $60 a month. For further savings, you can get half off your first month of any plan when you sign up, and add on premium channels like Showtime, Starz, AMC+, and MGM+ for additional monthly fees. At the time of publication, Sling currently offers your first month for only $36, or the combined plan for $51. If you're looking for international channels, Sling TV has more options than any other service, including numerous Asian, European, Arabic, Brazilian, and Portuguese language options. However, Sling TV falls short when compared to other services' DVR offerings--it only includes 50 hours of DVR storage unless you pay extra. It also doesn't come with many local channels, though the platform suggests adding on an antenna -- which you'll have to buy if you don't already have one.Bottom line: If you're looking for a basic and affordable live TV streaming service that still gets you a good number of channels and an easy-to-use interface -- and you're not deterred by antennas -- Sling TV is a great choice. Sling TV features: Channels: 30+ | Plan options: 3 | Video storage: 50 hours | Price: Starts at $40 per month

View now at DirecTV DirecTV Stream is the live TV streaming service that most resembles cable, both in terms of the user experience and the price tag. The Entertainment plan costs $87 a month for more than 90 channels, the Choice plan costs $115 a month for more than 125 channels, and the Ultimate plan is $130 a month for more than 160 channels. At the time of publication, DirecTV's Choice and Ultimate plans were on sale for $90 per month and $105 per month, respectively. You can also add on a sports pack to each of these plans for an extra $15 a month, which includes ESPN, NFL Network, MLB Network, and more regional sports networks than many others on this list. DirecTV Stream also offers unlimited in-home streams -- three maximum out-of-home streams -- and unlimited DVR storage. DirecTV Stream lets you keep the nostalgic channel-flipping experience with the ability to swipe left and right on your phone to change channels -- worrying about changing your remote's batteries is a thing of the past. DirecTV Stream features: Channels: 75+ | Plan options: 3 | Video storage: Unlimited | Price: Starts at $87 per month

Factors to consider when choosing a live TV streaming service
Before you cut the cord and subscribe to a live TV streaming service, you should consider the following factors: Availability: Some of these services are only available in certain locations, or offer different channels depending on your location. Enter your zip code on their websites to find out more about what's available for you.Price: Since many people looking to cut the cord are aiming to save money, you'll want to consider how much you'll be spending each month on a live TV streaming service -- especially if you're already subscribed to other VoD streaming services like Netflix. Channel options: While most of the live TV streaming services on this list include similar cable channels, some don't include local channels, others don't include sports channels, and all require additional fees to access premium cable channels like Max, Starz, and Showtime. You'll want to consider what shows you want access to when choosing a service.DVR storage: All of the live TV streaming services on this list include some form of digital video recording (DVR) storage, so you can record live shows to watch at your convenience (and fast forward through commercials). However, they range widely, from just 50 hours of storage to unlimited storage. User experience: If you're making the switch from cable, you'll want to have a user-friendly live TV streaming service that's easy to navigate. Many of these services offer free trials, so if you're interested in testing them out, you can.

How we test live TV streaming services
I've spent hours testing and researching the live TV streaming services on this list, as well as other VoD streaming services over the years. When testing a streaming service, I typically subscribe to a free trial, and spend time using it over several days. When choosing my top streaming services picks, I consider the channel options (including whether the services include local, sports, or premium channels), features (like DVR storage and multiple stream options), the design and user experience of the service (including how easy it is to navigate), and finally the value (the price compared to the rest of these factors).

FAQs on live TV streaming services
What is the best live TV streaming service for sports?
The best live TV streaming service is FuboTV, which features both mainstream sports like football and hockey and non-mainstream sports like F1 racing and cricket. There are also several sports channel add-ons to choose from, including an NBA League Pass channel and International Sports Plus, so you'll find something for every sports fan.
Show more
Which is the best streaming service for NFL?
There are a number of different streaming services that you can use to watch NFL games, but they can vary considerably in their coverage types. For example, YouTube TV is where you'll find NFL Sunday Ticket, which lets you watch all out-of-market games. The NFL Plus streaming service also includes RedZone and the NFL network, though you'll only be able to watch local and primetime games on your phone, not your TV or computer. For more, check out our guide for how to watch NFL games live.
Show more
What live TV streaming service has the best picture quality?
YouTube TV and Hulu Plus Live TV support 1080p/60fps live streams on select platforms, so if picture quality is something that's important to you, these are both good options.
Show more
Is streaming cheaper than cable?
Short answer: It depends. When people first started cutting the cord over a decade ago, it was possible to save over $100 per month and still get to watch the shows you wanted. But today, internet streaming service bills have crept up closer to cable TV levels. However, if you're savvy about which services you subscribe to -- and if you can share subscriptions at times -- it's still possible to save.
Show more
What live stream service is the best substitute for cable?
The live TV streaming services on this list all have something to offer. While YouTube TV is my top pick generally, if you're looking for the closest thing to cable in terms of number of channels and user experience, I'd say go for DirecTV Stream.
Show more
What is the cheapest live TV streaming service?
The cheapest live TV streaming service is Philo TV which carries more than 115 channels, and includes A&E, Discovery Channel, Comedy Central, and more, for just $25 per month.
Show more
Which streaming services offer live TV?
Of the bigger streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, and Disney+, Hulu and Amazon Prime Video are the only two that offer any kind of live TV streaming at the moment. Hulu has a partnership with ESPN+, meaning that certain live sports events can be streamed through the basic Hulu plan without any additional cost. Amazon Prime Video has rights to Thursday Night NFL games, which allows Prime members to stream live football games from the Prime Video app.
Show more
Do you need fast internet to stream live TV?
To make use of any of these services, you'll need broadband internet. If you're living on your own, you may be able to get by with as little as 10Mbp. If you're sharing your home with others and/or you want to watch 4K videos, we recommend you have at least a 25Mbps internet connection. Not sure how fast your connection is? Run the Ookla Speedtest.And, by the way, you won't lose anything by switching from a cable box to a Roku or Amazon Fire TV 4K stick. The only real difference between conventional cable and internet TV is that live streaming sports lag 15 seconds to a minute behind live broadcasts.
Show more
Which streaming device should you use?
For the most part, all of these support the most popular streaming devices. For example, no matter which service you subscribe to, an Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV Cube, Roku Express, or Google Chromecast will almost certainly support it. But if you're using a more obscure streaming gadget, such as an Nvidia Shield TV Pro, it might not work with your preferred service. Smart TVs also frequently don't support newer streaming offerings. In short, make sure the service will work with your hardware before subscribing. Also: The best streaming devices
