Jason Hiner/ZDNETThis month, Apple officially launched TVOS 26 to the public. This upgrade introduces a significant visual overhaul and several unprecedented entertainment features. The platform offers a new layout and interface, along with smart features that weren't available in TVOS 18.At the heart of the update is a new design language called Liquid Glass, which gives the interface a more vibrant and expressive look. Across iOS 26 devices, Liquid Glass offers floating, three-dimensional menus and windows, translucent UI elements like icons and menus allowing background visibility, and a rounded design with softer edges for a more organic interface look.Also: The best Apple TV VPNs of 2025: Expert tested and reviewedFor Apple TV, in particular, the redesign will now showcase cinematic poster art for a more immersive browsing experience. The update also streamlines profile switching and app logins, making it easier to access personalized content. Apple's TVOS 26 is also expected to incorporate new Apple Intelligence features in the coming year.
AppleAnother new feature, Apple Music Sing will now let users sing along -- karaoke style -- with friends using their iPhones (as a microphone) with on-screen lyrics. Even better, multiple iPhones can be connected simultaneously, allowing friends and family to join in. They can queue up their favorite tracks and send emoji reactions that appear on the TV screen in real-time.Other notable updates include a more personalized FaceTime experience with the addition of Contact Posters and an expansion of Live Captions to translate languages like Spanish, French, German, and more.Also: Downloading iOS 26? Do these 6 things on your iPhone first (and thank me later)The beloved Aerial screen savers are also enhanced with captivating landscapes, and for the first time, users can choose which categories of screen savers to display. Finally, a key audio upgrade will now allow users to designate any AirPlay-enabled speaker as the permanent, default audio output for their Apple TV.You can update to TVOS 26 within your Apple TV settings. Just make sure you have a stable internet connection and a bit of patience. It'll all be worth it.Featured
