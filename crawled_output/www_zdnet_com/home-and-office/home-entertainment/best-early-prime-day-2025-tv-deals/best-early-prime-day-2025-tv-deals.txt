When is October Prime Day 2025? Amazon's October Prime Day will be held on October 7 and 8, 2025. And while that's still a few weeks away, you can already find steep markdowns on big brands like Sony and Samsung as well as Hisense, TCL, and more. Are TVs really cheaper on Prime Day? They can be! Amazon often features discounts on a variety of TVs throughout the year, but especially during the Prime Day sale events. While each discount varies by brand and model, it's possible to save 30, 40, or even 50 percent on a high-end TV for upgrading your home theater.
