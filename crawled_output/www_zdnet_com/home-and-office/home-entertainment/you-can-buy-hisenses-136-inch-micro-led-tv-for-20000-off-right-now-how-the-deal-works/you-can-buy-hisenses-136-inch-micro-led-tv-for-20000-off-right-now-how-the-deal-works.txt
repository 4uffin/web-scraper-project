Kerry Wan/ZDNETFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google. ZDNET's takeawaysHisense's new 136-inch micro-LED TV is on sale now.It carries an MSRP of $149,999.This is Hisense's first micro LED TV offering.If you think bigger is always better, Hisense has something you might be interested in.The company's absolutely monster, ultra-premium 136MX Micro-LED TV is officially on sale. If you missed the unveiling announcement back in January, the 136MX isn't just a model number; it's the TV's size. Also: Roku's first TV projector gives you a 150-inch screen - for less than $200Hisense's newest offering, a massive 136-inch, anti-glare display, packs a just as massive price. It carries an MSRP of $149,999, but it is currently on sale for $20,000 off, or $129,999 (although you won't get it until the second week of October). For comparison, Sony's 114-inch micro LED from last year carried a similar price tag.The company says the TV was built in response to consumer demand for larger sets, but will anyone buy this one? Is it actually worth it? Here's a look.What a $129,999 TV looks likeNaturally, the specs on this set are pretty impressive. It's a micro LED (25 million microscopic LEDs to be exact), so it doesn't need a separate backlighting system. This means a brighter picture, better color, and better contrast than its mini LED counterparts. Its 10,000 nits of brightness is far above most other sets on the market, and it runs on Hi-View AI Engine X, which uses AI-based algorithms to optimize each frame.Hisense noted that the 136MX has a 90% BT.2020 color gamut and a display that's both Pantone Validated and Pantone SkinTone Validated (meaning you'll get near-perfect color accuracy). It'll have Dolby Vision IQ, Dolby Vision, and Dolby Atmos, but not the just-announced Dolby Vision 2. A refresh rate of 120Hz, Auto Low Latency Mode, and FreeSync Premium Pro will appeal to gamers.Also: I was struggling to hear TV dialogue until this soundbar fixed everything for cheapOne last warning, televisions are measured diagonally of course, but the actual width of this set is just over 118 inches, or 9.8 feet. This TV might fit in your home if you're going straight inside from the door, but if you have to go around any corners, you might be in trouble.While this set obviously isn't intended for the average consumer, it does show a shift towards larger sets. Most of this year's best TVs offer a 98-inch option, and several manufacturers offer options well over 100 inches. Featured
