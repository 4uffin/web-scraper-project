It's official: Amazon's Prime Big Deal Days sale will return Oct. 7-8. The sale, more popularly known as October Prime Day, is one of the first to kick off the holiday shopping season. You're sure to see discounts on plenty of items, including dozens of gadgets and trinkets that won't break the bank. Also: Everything you need to know about Prime Big Deal DaysI cover deals 24/7, and I know a thing or two about finding the best offers to share with you. Amazon and competing retailers tend to inflate prices to make deals and discounts look greater than they are. That's why I've vetted and curated these deals, featuring ZDNET-tested and recommended products, plus some of my own personal selections you can't find anywhere else. Here are my favorite picks for the best budget-friendly early October Prime Day deals -- primarily under $25. Follow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.Find Prime Day dealsBest deals under $25 for Prime Day 2025

More October Prime Day deals under $25 Pure Enrichment XL Heating Pad: $38 (save $2): This is over $25, but it's a solid, oversized heating pad. I bought this last year during October Prime Day, and it's held up great, and it will likely drop in price for the event. LC-Dolida Wireless CarPlay Adapter: $20 (save $20): Bring wireless play to any vehicle with this auto adapter for over half off. Citymore Bluetooth Wallet Tracker Card: $15 (save $15): This wallet tracker card is thin enough to slide into your wallet to add bluetooth tracking like an AirTag. Plus, it's half off. Cable Management Box Kit: $21 (save $4): I personally recommend this affordable cable management box for storing unsightly cords and keeping them contained. I have one under my desk and it's helped keep my curious cat out of the cables, too. Travel Inspiria Luggage Scale: $9 (save $4): This luggage tag is one of Amazon's best sellers, and it's under $10 now. AirPods Cleaner Tool: $7 (save $2): This is the only tool I use to clean my AirPods Pro 2 earbuds, and it's super compact, too. GhostCover Keyboard Protector for MacBooks: $13: I should've had this on my MacBook Pro keyboard from the start because it keeps fingerprint oil off my keys and is easy to clean. Kindle Remote Control: $10 (save $3): Expert Maria Diaz loves this page turner for her Kindle. Livho Bluelight Glasses 2-Pack: $14 (save $3): Block out the blue light for under $20 right now (these made it into my own cart). Tapo TP-Link Indoor Camera: $16 (save $9): Keep a watchful eye on a furry friend or your home with this affordable camera.When is October Prime Day 2025? October Prime Day returns on Tuesday, Oct. 7, through Wednesday, Oct. 8. Are deals really cheaper on Prime Day? The legitimacy of Prime Day is a hotly debated topic every year. Basically, Prime Day does have some legit deals, usually on flagship Amazon products like Fire TVs, Echo devices, Kindles, and more. However, the best way to ensure you're getting an actually deal is to prepare to shop for offers and use price tracking tools to make sure you don't fall victim to brands marking up items to "discount" them later. Luckily, these offers are all under $25, so they won't be breaking the bank -- even if they do end up being an impulse purchase or sweet treat (I'm not judging). How did we choose these October Prime Day deals?ZDNET only writes about deals we want to buy -- devices and products we desire, need, or would recommend. Our experts looked for deals that were at least 20% off (or are hardly ever on sale), using established price comparison tools and trackers to determine whether the deal is actually on sale and how frequently it drops. We also looked over customer reviews to find out what matters to real people who already own and use the deals we're recommending. Our recommendations may also be based on our own testing -- in addition to extensive research and comparison shopping. The goal is to deliver the most accurate advice to help you shop smarter. Our top Prime Day deals
