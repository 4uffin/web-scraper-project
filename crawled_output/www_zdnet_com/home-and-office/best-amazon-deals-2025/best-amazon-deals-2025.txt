FAQs
How did we choose these Amazon deals? ZDNET only writes about deals we want to buy -- devices and products we desire, need, or would recommend. Our experts looked for deals that were at least 20% off (or are hardly ever on sale), using established price comparison tools and trackers to determine whether the deal is actually on sale and how frequently it drops. We also looked over customer reviews to find out what matters to real people who already own and use the deals we're recommending. Our recommendations may also be based on our own testing -- in addition to extensive research and comparison shopping. The goal is to deliver the most accurate advice to help you shop smarter. When will these deals expire? Amazon deals can expire at anytime. Select Prime-exclusive offers, limited time offers or lightning deals are time contingent, meaning you'll want to take advantage of them when you see them. Other deals, like standard discounts and drops may remain for longer periods. However, deals are subject to sell out or expire at any time, though ZDNET remains committed to finding, sharing, and updating the best product deals for you to score the best savings. Our team of experts regularly checks in on the deals we share to ensure they are still live and obtainable. We're sorry if you've missed out on a deal, but don't fret -- we're constantly finding new chances to save and sharing them with you at ZDNET.com. When is the next Prime Day? Amazon's next event is the upcoming Prime Big Deal Days. More commonly called October Prime Day, the fall savings event will return Oct. 7-8 this year and serves as a kick off to the holiday shopping season. How much is an Amazon Prime membership? Amazon Prime costs $15 per month, or you can purchase an annual membership for $139, which will save you a few dollars. Also: Get 50% off an Amazon Prime membership if you're age 18-24 - here's howCollege students and those aged 18-24 can get a discount and pay $8 per month or $69 per year. In addition, those with qualified government assistance (which may include select seniors) can receive a Prime membership for just $7 after their free trial.
