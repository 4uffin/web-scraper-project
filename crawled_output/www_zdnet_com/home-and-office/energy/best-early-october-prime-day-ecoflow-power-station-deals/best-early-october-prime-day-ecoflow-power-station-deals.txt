Amazon's Prime Big Deal Days sale, otherwise known as October Prime Day, is coming up soon. This year, it runs October 7-8, and you can once again expect to find some great deals on everything from smartphones and laptops to home goods. There will be some welcomed deals on power stations, too. And if you look closely, these deals are already deals trickling in. One company that's offering some good deals ahead of Prime Day is EcoFlow.  Also: The best portable power stations to last through power outagesI don't just test power stations -- I've already tested several dozen this year, small and large -- I use them myself. A lot. At home for harvesting solar power to save a few bucks and to sail through the occasional power outage, and when I'm out and about off-grid. I always have one in the car or truck. They're a core part of my kit. These are my favorite EcoFlow deals so far.Find Prime Day deals Best early Prime Day EcoFlow power station deals
EcoFlow River 2 Pro for $379 (save $150)
Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNET
Current price: $379 (28% off)Original price: $529I love this power station! The River 2 Pro has 768Wh of power stored in a bank of long-life LiFePO4 cells with a 3,000 recharge cycle lifespan (good for a decade of heavy use) that can be fast-charged in 70 minutes. The power capacity is enough to run a small kitchen appliance for an hour, a 50W electric blanket for 12 hours, or charging my smartphone several dozen times over.  Review: I test power stations for a living, but this is the one in the back of my car right now

EcoFlow Delta 3 Plus for $699 (save $200)
Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNET
Current price: $699 (22% off)Original price: $899This is a big upgrade on its predecessor. It's built tough, has improved cooling so it can be pushed harder yet runs super quiet. Also, when it comes to outdoor use, I was pleased to find out that the Delta 3 Plus features a 1,024Wh battery pack that's IP65 rated for dust and water-resistance. This increases the life of the unit and dramatically decreases the risk of fires and short circuits. Review: I found a compact power station with solar charging, and it's a new off-grid essential

EcoFlow River 2 Max for $319 (save $130)
Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNET
Current price: $319 (29% off)Original price: $449This is one of those Goldilocks power stations -- not too big, but also not too small. It builds on the River 2, taking things to the next level. Its capacity is doubled to 512Wh, its weight is bumped up to 13.4 pounds, and it is capable of a sustained AC output of 500W (1,000W max). While 13.4 pounds is hefty, it's 22% lighter than previous-generation EcoFlow units of comparable specs.Review: I found a great portable power station for off-grid adventures

When is October Prime Day 2025?  Amazon's Prime Big Deal Days sale, otherwise known as October Prime Day, runs Oct. 7 and 8, back to the usual two-day sale extravaganza, and not the four days that we saw back in July.
Are power stations really cheaper on Prime Day?  I watch prices closely, and yes, I can say with absolute certainty that you can find lots of great deals during the Amazon Prime Day sales. In fact, I've found some absolute killer deals to share with you. It's also a good time to get a good deal on combos that come with the power station and an expansion battery and/or solar panels.
How did we choose these October Prime Day deals? Here at ZDNET, I only write about deals that interest me -- the devices and gear I desire, need, or would recommend. I look for the best possible deal and seek out those things that are only occasionally on sale. I use established price comparison tools and trackers to determine whether the deal is actually on sale and how frequently it drops.  I also pay attention to customer reviews to find out what matters to real people who already own and use the deals I'm recommending. I'm one person testing one thing, so it's useful to get a broader sampling. The goal is to deliver the most accurate advice to help you shop smarter.
