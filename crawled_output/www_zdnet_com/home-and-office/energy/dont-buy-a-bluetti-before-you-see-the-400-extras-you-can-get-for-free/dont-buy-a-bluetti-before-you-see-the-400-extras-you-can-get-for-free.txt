Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNETFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google. ZDNET's key takeaways Great deal on Amazon for customers buying Bluetti hardware.Get a freebie worth up to $400.You do need to spend over $1,000 and be an Amazon Prime customer.Power stations are expensive, so anything you can do to sweeten the deal is always welcome. Premium power station manufacturer Bluetti is having a cool promotion over on Amazon -- where, if you buy stuff, you can pick some free stuff.Also: The best portable power stations to last through power outagesAnd this is cool, useful free stuff. Not some tote bag or stickers.
How you can get in on this dealThere are four levels to this deal, depending on how much you spend.
If you spend $1,500 on qualifying products, you get a Bluetti Handsfree 1 backpackable 268.8Wh portable power station worth $250 for free. Spend $2,000 and get the awesome Bluetti X20 153.6Wh laptop power bank worth $300 (I reviewed that here). Those spending $2,500 or more get the bigger Bluetti Handsfree 2 512Wh backpackable power station worth $350 (I reviewed that here).
Also: Why I travel with 3 different portable power stations (and can't get out of the habit)And for the big spenders dropping $3,000 or more, they can get the Bluetti Charger 1 560W in-vehicle charger worth $400. I've got these installed in my vehicles, and they dramatically reduce charging time for compatible power stations while on the road, and are a must-have for hardcore power station users. Like I said, these go beyond niff-naff items, and you're getting darn good products.
Oh, you do need to be an Amazon Prime member to get these deals.
Amazon/ZDNETHere's how to access those deals. Click on one of the links above to a Bluetti product, and on the listings you'll find the qualifying items.
Qualifying items Amazon/ZDNETYou'll also see the benefit items.
Benefit items. Amazon/ZDNETJust make sure they're all added to your basket before checking out, and you're good to go! Also: The best cheap portable power stations of 2025If you've been contemplating buying a power station, and were going to be spending upwards of $1,000, this is definitely a deal worth looking at. Bluetti makes some fantastic power stations, like the top-notch Elite 200 V2 that I recently reviewed. You can't go wrong. Featured
