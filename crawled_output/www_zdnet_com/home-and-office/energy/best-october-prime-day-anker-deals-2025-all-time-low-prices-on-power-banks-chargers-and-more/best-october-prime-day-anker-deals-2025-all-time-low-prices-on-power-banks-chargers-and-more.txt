These are my favorite early October Prime Day Anker deals.Find Prime Day dealsMy favorite Anker deals ahead of October Prime Day 2025
Anker Nano 10,000 mAh power bank for $50 (save $10)
Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNET
Current price: $50 (17% off)Original price: $60The Anker Nano offers everything that most people want from their power bank, and it is the power bank that I recommend to people who say they "just want a good power bank." It offers decent to top up a smartphone during the day, it has both USB-A and USB-C ports so you're covered for all eventualities, and there's even a built-in USB-C cable, so you can't forget it.Review: This Anker Nano has become my everyday power bank - here's why

Anker Solix C300 DC portable power station for $170 (save $80)
Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNET
Current price: $170 (32% off)Original price: $250Let's cut straight to the exciting part of this unit -- you can charge the Solix C300 DC using two 140W USB-C inputs, delivering a maximum of 280W of power. This can take the unit from flat to 80% in just an hour. If you only have a short time with some AC power, this can be a game-changer, allowing you to charge the unit in half the time it might otherwise take. Review: My favorite portable power station for traveling can charge any device

Anker Solix C800 Plus portable power station for $349 (save $250)
Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNET
Current price: $349 (42% off)Original price: $599The Solix C800 Plus, at its heart, is a power beast, stuffed with durable LiFePO4 batteries that can stash a whopping 768Wh of power. Plus, it's got ten ports ready to charge up all your gadgets. It's like the Goldilocks of power stations. But where the Solix C800 Plus shines is the accessories hidden inside a flip-top compartment on the top of the unit -- inside this compartment are two battery-powered LED lights and a telescopic pole.Â Review: This portable power station has a standout feature that makes camping safer

Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNET
Current price: $65 (20% off)Original price: $80The Anker 200W Prime 6-port charging station is a solid, powerful, well-made charger, and is perfect for those who need to power multiple devices. I particularly like that this charger can support dual 100W output on the USB-C ports, as this means it can power a couple of MacBooks Pros simultaneously.Â Review: One of the best GaN USB-C chargers I've tested can top up 6 devices at once

Anker MagGo 10,000mAh MagSafe charger for $60 (save $80)
Kayla Solino/ZDNET
Current price: $60 (25% off)Original price: $80A thin and light power bank to slap onto your MagSafe iPhone to give you a good few hours of extra runtime. This power bank can charge an iPhone 14 Pro, 15 Pro, or 16 Pro to 91% maximum capacity, which is a substantial runtime boost.Review: This Qi2 battery pack from Anker just made wireless charging essential for me

Anker Laptop Docking Station, 13-in-1 USB-C Docking Station for $140 (save $60)
Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNET
Current price: $140 (30% off)Original price: $200It's a fact of life that modern systems ship with fewer and fewer ports. While this suits many people, it can be a bit of a pain for professionals. Enter the Anker PowerExpand Elite 13-in-1 dock. This is a professional-quality desktop dock that is enough to power a whole desktop of peripherals. While this is not a new product -- it was first released in 2020 -- mine is still going strong and does the job well.Also: The ultimate must-have Thunderbolt 3 accessory for Mac and Windows users

When is October Prime Day 2025?Â  Amazon's Prime Big Deal Days sale, otherwise known as October Prime Day, runs over Oct. 7 and 8, back to the usual two-day sale extravaganza, and not the four days that we saw back in July.
Are gadgets like chargers and power banks really cheaper on Prime Day?Â  I watch prices closely, and yes, I can say with absolute certainty that you can find lots of great deals during the Amazon Prime Day sales. In fact, I've found some absolute killer deals to share with you here in the run-up to the event.Â  How did we choose these October Prime Day deals? Here at ZDNET, I only write about deals that interest me -- the devices and gear I desire, need, or would recommend. I look for the best possible deal and seek out those things that are only occasionally on sale. I use established price comparison tools and trackers to determine whether the deal is actually on sale and how frequently it drops.Â I also pay attention to customer reviews to find out what matters to real people who already own and use the deals I'm recommending. I'm one person testing one thing, so it's useful to get a broader sampling. The goal is to deliver the most accurate advice to help you shop smarter.
