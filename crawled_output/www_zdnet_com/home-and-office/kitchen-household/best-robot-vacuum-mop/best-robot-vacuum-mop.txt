I began using robot vacuum and mop combinations over six years ago to check some chores off my to-do list. Little did I know this would launch me into the world of testing the latest and greatest robot vacuums. These machines have greatly evolved since, from dragging a soggy microfiber pad across your floors to self-washing rotating mop pads, mop rollers, and self-emptying dustbins. All the different options make picking the right product for your needs challenging, but we're here to help.What is the best robot vacuum mop right now?At ZDNET, we have tested dozens of the best robot vacuum mops available and have seen firsthand that it is possible to sit back and relax while one of these machines takes care of all the hard work. Based on our testing, our pick for the best robot vacuum mop overall is the Roborock Saros 10R, thanks to its outstanding performance, self-empty and self-cleaning features, and oscillating mop pads with extendable capability. Check out the rest of our tested picks for the best robot vacuum mop combos below.Also: Why I recommend this Roborock over competing robot vacuums (and I've tested dozens)

View now at Amazon Why we like it: The Roborock Saros 10R is the best two-in-one robot vacuum mop I've tested thus far. It features an industry-leading 22,000Pa of suction power and dusts the competition. It features a self-emptying dustbin, self-washing mop pads with customizable water temperature, a side-reaching sweeper brush, and an extendable mop pad to reach tight corners. The app has many settings and customizations, from thorough carpet vacuuming to AI-guided cleaning.Review: Roborock Saros 10RWho it's for: The Roborock Saros 10R is a fairly new robot vacuum and mop that's perfect for anyone looking for the best hands-free cleaning experience. You don't have to worry about manually washing mop pads or constantly refilling water after each cleaning. This robot also has very good obstacle avoidance, so you also don't have to worry about picking up every little cord from your floor before running it. Who should look elsewhere: One of its few downsides is that it's priced steeply at $1,600, so it's definitely not the most affordable robot vacuum available. As a premium robot with high-end features, this robot is priced to match. Roborock Saros 10R specs: Price: $1,600 | Battery life: 180 mins | Base station dimensions: 15 x 18.7 x 19.21 inches | Suction power: 22,000Pa | Dustbin volume: 270 ml | Water tank capacity: 69 ml

View now at Amazon Why we like it: The iRobot Roomba Combo i5 is one of the most affordable robot vacuum and mops available right now. It's an older Roomba model, which is why its price has dropped considerably, but it is still available for purchase. This robot features iRobot's signature dual multi-surface rubber brushes, which perform really well on hard floors and carpet. It also has an edge sweeping brush to reach corners and along the edges of furniture and walls.Who it's for: This robot vacuum and mop comes with two separate dustbins: one for vacuuming only and another for vacuuming and mopping simultaneously. The dustbins can be easily swapped out, depending on the function you want the robot to operate in at any given time. The robot is one of the most affordable on the market, especially for the technology wrapped within it. It's a perfect choice if you're on a tight budget but don't want to sacrifice quality.Also: iRobot's best Roomba just hit its lowest price ever at almost half offWho should look elsewhere: The Roomba Combo i5 requires manual intervention to switch the dustbins, empty them, and fill the mopping one with clean water. You also have to manually wash the mop pad before and after each cleaning. If you'd rather not have to intervene before and after a cleaning session or prefer a robot that can autonomously empty its dustbin and wash its mop pads, you should look elsewhere. iRobot Roomba Combo i5 tech specs: Price: $199 | Battery life: 180 minutes | Wi-Fi: Yes | Dimensions: 13.4 x 13.5 x 3.6 inches | Suction power: Not specified | Dustbin volume: 360 ml | Water tank capacity: 210 ml

View now at Amazon Why we like it: The Eufy S1 Pro is an outstanding mop because it uses a roller mop that is scrubbed clean inside the robot as it washes your floors. The robot does this to keep its mop clean and ensure that only clean water is used while mopping, so you never worry about dragging dirty mop pads all over your house.This results in the cleanest floors a robot vacuum and mop has ever left behind in my home. It easily removes dirt and harder-to-clean spots. This mopping system is so advanced that it uses water ozonification to disinfect the clean water you put in the tank. Hence, it truly cleans with the cleanest water possible, though this feature can be turned off. Review: Eufy S1 ProWho it's for: The S1 Pro is perfect for consumers with mostly hard floors at home and those who value having their floors freshly mopped. This robot's mopping performance is the closest thing you can get to a manual mopping experience, which is perfect between deeper cleaning sessions. The Eufy S1 Pro's self-washing mop roller is far superior to the traditional microfiber mop pads robot vacuum and mop combinations use.Who should look elsewhere: The only thing preventing the Eufy S1 Pro from taking the top spot as the best robot vacuum and mop overall is that the Roborock Saros 10R outperforms its vacuum feature. The Eufy S1 Pro features good obstacle avoidance but is less reliable than the Saros 10R. It can vacuum up larger pieces of paper and debris, and get its brush roller stuck, forcing you to rescue it or risk the cleaning task remaining incomplete. So if you don't want to pick up every cord or toy before each cleaning, you'd benefit from the Saros 10R's obstacle avoidance.However, the Eufy S1 Pro's obstacle avoidance feature outperforms the Yeedi M12 Pro+ and the Ecovacs Deebot X2 Combo Complete, other standout robot vacuums and mops on this list. Eufy S1 Pro features: Price: $1,300 | Battery life: 216 minutes | Wi-Fi: Yes | Dimensions: 18.4 x 15 x 26.4 inches | Suction power: 8,000Pa | Dustbin volume: 250 ml | Water tank capacity: 240 ml

View now at Amazon Why we like it: The Yeedi M12 Pro+ is a surprisingly affordable robot vacuum and mop. It combines some of the strongest suction power on the market, capable of tackling different floor types in one go, with its mop pads that lift 9mm when going over carpets. The M12 Pro+ has an extendable mop pad to clean areas often missed by robot vacuum and mop combos, like under the edge of cabinets.Review: Yeedi M12 Pro+As a midrange robot vacuum and mop, the M12 Pro+ offers great standout features, including a self-emptying dustbin, self-washing mop pads, and a V-shaped roller brush to prevent hair tangles.Who it's for: In my testing, this is one of the best-value robot vacuum and mop combos on the market. It's perfect for those looking for a midrange price or to get into the market of self-emptying, self-washing robots without paying a fortune. Who should look elsewhere: Because the Yeedi M12 Pro+ costs a fraction of the price of our best pick overall, you'd have to compromise on some of the high-end features that other models offer. While you get autonomous cleaning capabilities, the M12 Pro+ requires you to ensure your floors are clear of debris and obstacles before running it, or it's likely to get stuck.Yeedi M12 Pro+ tech specs: Price: $400 (limited time deal) | Battery life: 290 minutes | Wi-Fi: Yes | Dimensions: 16 x 19.3 x 18.9 inches | Suction power: 11,000Pa | Dustbin volume: 300 ml | Water tank capacity: 55 ml

View now at Amazon Why we like it: Thanks to its 8,700Pa suction power, the Ecovacs Deebot X2 can vacuum up hair, dirt, and debris on every flooring type possible. That's not all, though. The Combo Complete variation also has a cordless vacuum that empties itself into the charging dock when you're done using it. Its strong suction and effective mopping kept my floors free of pet hair and muddy paw prints during testing.This Ecovacs robot vacuum and mop is a self-cleaning, self-emptying, self-drying, and self-refilling two-in-one machine, removing all the dirty work from vacuuming and mopping. Who it's for: Thanks to the attached handheld vacuum, this robot is perfect for pet owners trying to tackle hair on their floors and furniture. Additionally, if you have furniture that sits lower or chairs that collect a lot of dirt underneath, or kids who are messy eaters, this robot will be for you. Its square design and smaller stature, 12.6 inches wide, mean this robot can fit in more spaces than many competitors. Review: Ecovacs Deebot X2 Combo CompleteWho should look elsewhere: Like the vast majority of robot vacuums on the market, this one isn't flawless. While it's fantastic against pet hair, its obstacle avoidance leaves something to be desired. The robot can get its roller brush stuck on random items on your floors, including some charging cords. This doesn't make it a great candidate for homes with younger kids that often leave messes behind, unless you don't mind picking up each one before a cleaning.Ecovacs Deebot X2 Combo Complete tech specs: Price: $1,700 | Battery life: 161 minutes | Wi-Fi: Yes | Dimensions: 12.6 x 13.8 x 3.7 inches | Suction power: 8,700Pa | Dustbin volume: 300 ml | Water tank capacity: 80 ml| Extra features: Cordless stick vacuum

Factors to consider when choosing a robot vacuum mop
While trying to determine the best robot vacuum mops, I kept several factors at the forefront of my testing and research that can also aid in your search.Floor types: Some robot vacuum mops are equipped to work with certain floor types, like carpet or hardwood. Others may be able to accommodate other floor types, like stone or marble. Before you buy, consider the types of flooring in your home and which vacuum is most appropriate.Mapping: For full automation, your robot vacuum mop must have a mapping feature to navigate each room. You also want to consider an obstacle avoidance feature that can avoid things like furniture, wires, and even pet waste. This feature is a must-have in my home with strewn about.Battery: A robot vacuum mop is hardly worth it if it doesn't have the battery to keep it going. Consider the battery time before choosing the best robot vacuum mop to ensure it has enough power to clean your home. If you select a robot vacuum with the technical capability to pause its job, return to the charging base to refill its battery, and then resume the job where it left off, this may not be as big of a factor as others on this list.Connectivity: Many of the best robot vacuum mops offer voice control, some even with Alexa. Others may feature an app that allows you to control your robot from afar, set schedules, track progress, and control the machine's efforts. If you're hoping for voice activation rather than using an app, check and see if the machine is compatible with the home assistant of your choice.
