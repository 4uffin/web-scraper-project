I Built LexKit: A Modern, Type-Safe Rich Text Editor for React

Meet LexKit Editor: The Simple, Powerful, Headless Text Editor You’ll Wish You Had Sooner
Hey Dev.to crew! If you’ve ever torn your hair out building a rich text editor, this one’s for you. I’m thrilled to share LexKit Editor, a new open-source project I launched today, September 14, 2025. It’s a headless, TypeScript-friendly framework built on Lexical (Meta’s beast of an editor) that makes creating custom editors actually fun. No bloat, no headaches, just a clean, extensible tool for your React apps. And it’s free under the MIT license!
Why I Built LexKit (and Why You’ll Care)
Like many of you, I’ve wrestled with editors like TinyMCE (too heavy), Draft.js (RIP), and even Lexical (powerful but a setup nightmare). I wanted a tool that’s fast, flexible, and doesn’t force me to write endless boilerplate. After months of tinkering—and some late-night AI-assisted brainstorming (thanks, Grok by xAI!)—LexKit was born to solve these pain points:
Type-Safe Awesomeness: Write code with confidence. LexKit’s TypeScript integration means your commands and extensions are fully typed with autocomplete. No more guessing or runtime errors!
const { useEditor } = createEditorSystem([boldExtension, imageExtension]);
const { commands } = useEditor();
commands.toggleBold(); // ✅ Autocompleted
commands.insertImage({ src: "cat.jpg" }); // ✅ Validated
commands.oops(); // ❌ Caught at compile-time
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Headless Freedom: Build your UI however you want—ShadCN, Radix, or plain CSS. LexKit only handles the editor logic, so you’re not stuck with someone else’s styles.
Plug-and-Play Extensions: Over 25 extensions for bold, lists, images, markdown, and more. Configure them easily:
imageExtension.configure({
uploadHandler: async (file) => { /* Your upload logic */ },
resizable: true,
});
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Production-Ready: Undo/redo, multi-format editing (HTML, Markdown, JSON), and error handling—all baked in.
Light as a Feather: Built on Lexical’s virtual DOM, LexKit’s core is ~20kb gzipped. Your app stays snappy.
Why This Matters in 2025
With AI tools and React apps exploding, we need editors that keep up. LexKit lets you build custom editors for blogs, CMS, or note-taking apps without reinventing the wheel. It’s the balance of power and simplicity I’ve always wanted.
Get Started in Minutes
Here’s how to add LexKit to your React project:
Install:
npm install @lexkit/editor lexical @lexical/react @lexical/html @lexical/markdown @lexical/list @lexical/rich-text
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Set Up a Basic Editor:
import { createEditorSystem, boldExtension, imageExtension } from '@lexkit/editor';
const extensions = [boldExtension, imageExtension];
const { Provider, useEditor } = createEditorSystem(extensions);
function MyEditor() {
const { commands } = useEditor();
return (
<Provider extensions={extensions}>
<button onClick={() => commands.toggleBold()}>Bold</button>
<div contentEditable={true} />
</Provider>
);
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
