Like ride-sharing, these compact two-wheelers were eagerly adopted by riders, kicking off what is seen as a revolution in micromobility. They can be a fun and easy way to make short trips, and startups like Bird and Lime are using that to raise huge amounts of cash. But critics complain they block sidewalks and cause injuries, and cities have struggled to manage their growth, which suggests that the scooter wars have only just begun.NewsNewsAn electric scooter that accelerates faster than a Tesla Model 3?

HawkinsDec 21, 2022LinkBird bailed out.The struggling scooter company merged with Bird Canada, an independently owned micromobility business from up north, in a deal that valued it at $64 million. As Oversharing’s Alison Griswold notes, the deal was less of a merger and more of a reverse-takeover.The big question is whether the proudly Canadian Bird Canada team is right to believe that it can turn Bird Global around and get it to profitability. The merger release says the goal is for Bird to reach adjusted EBITDA profitability on a full year basis in 2023, and presumably for straightforward EBITDA profitability to follow after that. The immediate infusion of $4 million in cash should give Bird Global some breathing room, with more to follow assuming the transaction is completed.⚡️Breaking⚡️: Bird Canada to bail out Bird Global in reverse-takeover[oversharing.substack.com]ATwitterComments0Andrew J. HawkinsDec 13, 2022LinkBird is getting desperate.As noted by Oversharing’s Alison Griswold, the scooter sharing company is so strapped for cash that its hounding current and former customers for literal pennies. People are understandably pissed off. Bird, which admitted last month to overstating its revenue for two-plus years, is rapidly running out of cash and may not have enough money to stay in business.

The warning came hours after the scooter company admitted to the SEC that it had overstated its revenue for two years and that its financial reports from 2020 and 2021 can “no longer be relied upon,” And its stock price is still trading under $1-per-share, putting Bird at risk of being delisted.
