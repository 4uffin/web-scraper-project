Jessica Pegula speaking after her win over Katie Boulter: "Watching my teammate Emma win earlier definitely motivated me a lot, the way she turned that match around. If it wasn't for her I wouldn't have been in such a great position to win the match."I had to find a way to compete, I felt like my level wasn't there, she was playing at a high level but I was able to turn it around."It's the first time I will be in a final, it'll be a new experience and there's no one better I'd rather share it with. We have an awesome team, we're excited to be back and hopefully take the title.

If USA are able to do this, they've done it the hard way. Both Navarro and Pegula went a set down. But the GB fans are still cheering, they still believe.

Boulter saves the first break point as Pegula's forehand drops long but the Brit can't keep her backhand inside the lines and that hands over the double break.Pegula is one game away from putting the United States in a first final since 2018.

Pegula has so much experience that you expect her to close this out, but you never know. So far it has mirrored that second set.

That's unfortunate for Boulter. Twice in a row a net cord goes against her.Pegula quickly wraps up the hold to consolidate the break and puts herself within two games of taking the match.

Boulter is massively on the back foot as she tries desperately to make her returns but an overhead smash from Pegula sees off the point and hands her the break of serve. Again.Can she consolidate it this time?

What a point from Pegula!Brilliant movement to stay in the point and she runs around the ball to wrap her racquet round a forehand winner and bring up a break point.

Remember, Pegula struggled with the heavy hitting of Elena Rybakina in the quarter-final, losing her singles match to the former Wimbledon champion.She did recover to win the decisive doubles but would certainly rather get this done in two matches.

Ouch.Boulter throws herself, literally, towards Pegula's return and ends up taking a heavy fall.She looks fine but that was quite a bump.
