We've got some world-class tennis players down the other end. They also don't know what we're capable of," Boulter said."I think we're all going to have a free swing and get after them. I'm very excited for this next tie."To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.This video can not be playedMedia caption, Boulter win puts GB into BJK Cup semi-finalsAnalysis - Tennis correspondent Russell Fuller The belief exuded by this Great Britain team does not feel like bluff. They have now won seven of their past eight ties and reached the semi-finals three times in four years.But to beat the United States would be by far the greatest achievement of Anne Keothavong's captaincy.To do so, GB may need to channel the spirit of Katie Boulter at the United Cup on New Year's Eve in 2023.In her only previous meeting with world number seven Jessica Pegula, Boulter recovered from a set and 3-0 down in Perth to win the match in mesmerising style.There were the expected forehand winners, but also many points won at the net by Boulter and some staunch defence.Boulter was playing with a lot of freedom and confidence at the time. She entered these Finals with just one win in seven matches and little confidence in her serve.She says she feels like "a new version" of herself after some time at home and making changes to that service action, and it will have to be the very best version if she is to prove a match for Pegula's aggressive ball striking.The American does everything exceptionally well and will move Boulter around the court. Pegula has three titles, five finals and a US Open semi-final to her name this year.Kartal v NavarroWorld number 82 Kartal has proved a natural at BJK Cup, winning all three of her matches since making her debut earlier this year.Kartal has enjoyed a remarkable surge up the rankings in the past 18 months, achieving a career-high ranking of 44 after reaching the fourth round of Wimbledon for the first time this year.Her fearless mentality and on-court movement make her a valuable asset to Keothavong's team. while she has also taken a couple of top-20 scalps this year.An efficient win against Japan's Ena Shibahara got GB off to a winning start in the quarter-final and the 23-year-old will hope to do that again on Saturday.She may also spot potential weaknesses in the game of opponent Navarro, who was somewhat out of sorts and saved two match points in the deciding tie-break of her quarter-final against Kazakh Yulia Putintseva.To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.This video can not be playedMedia caption, GB's Kartal dominates rallies in BJK Cup winAnalysis - Tennis correspondent Russell FullerSonay Kartal's previous encounter with Emma Navarro was less encouraging. The 23-year-old won just three games on the grass courts of Ilkley in the summer of 2023.She prides herself on being a disrupter and has a proven ability to wear down a lot of opponents with her variety.Navarro, though, is unlikely to be worn down easily. She moves very well, is strong in defence and will relish a game of cat and mouse.She is unlikely to overwhelm Kartal with power, but will start a clear favourite - as the US will do in all three matches of this semi-final.What about the doubles?GB did not require the services of their doubles players against Japan, but Jodie Burrage and Fran Jones may be called upon if the tie against the US is level after two matches.Burrage and Boulter have also proved a winning partnership for Keothavong's team, with the duo winning the decisive doubles match against the Netherlands in April to seal GB's place in the Finals.A doubles match against Pegula and world number one doubles player Townsend would again provide a stern test for GB.Townsend is a two-time Grand Slam winner in the doubles and partnered Pegula to beat Kazakh pair Rybakina and Putintseva in straight sets and seal for the US a first BJK Cup semi-final in four years.Related topicsTennisMore on this storyLive scores, results and order of playGet tennis news sent straight to your phonePublished16 AugustComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 131Top storiesNot even Pope could persuade me to change - AmorimPublished3 hours ago'Fairytale' Canada deliver 'seismic' win over New ZealandPublished3 hours ago'Energised' Lyles makes happier Tokyo memories after heartbreakPublished9 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCA respectable man leads a vicious 'firm' of thugsThe best and worst foods to eat at sports groundsZara McDermott explores the dark side of ThailandChuck Wepner: The real-life Rocky who floored AliElsewhere in SportSuperb Canada beat champions New Zealand to reach final.
