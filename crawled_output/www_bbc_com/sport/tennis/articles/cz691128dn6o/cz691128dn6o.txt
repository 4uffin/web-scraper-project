"Every six months I go and test myself. I did my last test two weeks ago. It's a thing I have to live with."Borg had been checking himself for prostate cancer "for many years" before his doctors found a problem in 2023.They wanted to do follow-up tests, but Borg flew to Vancouver to serve as captain in the Laver Cup tennis tournament before returning for more tests."The thing is that you don't feel anything - you feel good, and then it's just happened," he said."I hope that I'm going to be OK.
