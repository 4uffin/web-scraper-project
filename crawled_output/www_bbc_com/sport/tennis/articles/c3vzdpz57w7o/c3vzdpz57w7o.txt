We qualified off our own bat - I think we are in a really strong position."It's really nice to have the same group of girls that were there before, and it's great to have some insight from Fran."Japan are also without their number one player after Naomi Osaka withdrew following her run to the US Open semi-finals."I think we've got a real shot at [winning] it," captain Keothavong said."We are the second seeds here, having reached the semi-finals twice in the past few years and come close to going further."Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Katie Boulter (left) and Sonay Kartal helped Great Britain reach the Billie Jean King Cup FinalsEmotional Raducanu beats Cristian in Korea OpenPublished3 days agoDefending champions Italy battle into BJK Cup semisPublished4 days agoMeet the GB team going for maiden BJK Cup titlePublished2 days agoKartal and Burrage played alongside Boulter in the Hague in April, when GB beat Germany and hosts the Netherlands to qualify for this week's eight-team finals.Raducanu missed those ties for a training block in Los Angeles with Mark Petchey, who was coaching her at the time."It's obviously disappointing, but I do want the main focus to be on the players I have and the challenge we have ahead," Keothavong added."I believe in the players that I've got. How the team were able to perform in April to get us into this position was fantastic, and I see no reason why we can't do the same."Players will make decisions they feel is in their best interest, but my focus is just on this team."We take a huge amount of pride in this competition and we do want to be world champions."Related topicsTennisMore on this storyLive scores, results and order of playGet tennis news sent straight to your phonePublished16 AugustTop storiesFormer Liverpool manager Beard dies aged 47Published2 hours ago'Norris misses opportunity in chaotic qualifying'Published7 hours ago'He deserves to be in our history' - Fernandes inspires Man UtdPublished4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCA respectable man leads a vicious 'firm' of thugsThe best and worst foods to eat at sports groundsZara McDermott explores the dark side of ThailandChuck Wepner: The real-life Rocky who floored AliElsewhere in Sport'Incredible' Kildunne adds swagger to party as England reach World Cup final'Silly and naive' - Rooney on Casemiro's poor decision-making
