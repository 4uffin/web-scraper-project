We qualified off our own bat - I think we are in a really strong position."It's really nice to have the same group of girls that were there before, and it's great to have some insight from Fran."Japan are also without their number one player after Naomi Osaka withdrew following her run to the US Open semi-finals."I think we've got a real shot at [winning] it," captain Keothavong said."We are the second seeds here, having reached the semi-finals twice in the past few years and come close to going further."Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Katie Boulter (left) and Sonay Kartal helped Great Britain reach the Billie Jean King Cup FinalsEmotional Raducanu beats Cristian in Korea OpenPublished17 SeptemberDefending champions Italy battle into BJK Cup semisPublished16 SeptemberMeet the GB team going for maiden BJK Cup titlePublished6 days agoKartal and Burrage played alongside Boulter in the Hague in April, when GB beat Germany and hosts the Netherlands to qualify for this week's eight-team finals.Raducanu missed those ties for a training block in Los Angeles with Mark Petchey, who was coaching her at the time."It's obviously disappointing, but I do want the main focus to be on the players I have and the challenge we have ahead," Keothavong added."I believe in the players that I've got. How the team were able to perform in April to get us into this position was fantastic, and I see no reason why we can't do the same."Players will make decisions they feel is in their best interest, but my focus is just on this team."We take a huge amount of pride in this competition and we do want to be world champions."Related topicsTennisMore on this storyLive scores, results and order of playGet tennis news sent straight to your phonePublished16 AugustTop storiesEurope 'fuelled by something money canât buy' - DonaldPublished1 hour agoWhy 'Wood has to watch his back' as Igor Jesus shines Published53 minutes agoRodgers' 'realism' hints at Celtic's new normal in Europa LeaguePublished30 minutes agoElsewhere on the BBCThe life of Gordon Welchman, a WW2 codebreaking heroThe best and worst foods to eat at sports groundsThe life and career of the iconic 1960s model, TwiggyLooking at the political language that defined recent monthsElsewhere in Sport'A cool scene' - but will Bethpage's first tee intimidate Europe?Chasing greatness through grief - England's warrior queenLamine Yamal - the eve of a new football era'Bird became cricket legend without scoring a run for England'Who are the players in England's Ashes squad?Why NFL Dublin opens 'new chapter' for Irish sportHow will each side fare in Prem Rugby?
