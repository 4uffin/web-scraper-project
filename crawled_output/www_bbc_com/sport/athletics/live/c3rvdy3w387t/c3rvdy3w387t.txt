Great Britain's Katarina Johnson-Thompson captured an emotional fourth global heptathlon medal in unprecedented circumstances as she shared world bronze with American Taliyah Brooks in a dramatic concluding 800m in Tokyo.Competing at the stadium where she suffered Olympic heartbreak four years ago, Johnson-Thompson, 32, did not know how to react as she continued her late-career resurgence by making a third consecutive major podium.Needing to beat Brooks by about six seconds to leapfrog her rival on to the podium, Johnson-Thompson wore a puzzled look as it was confirmed they had finished on exactly the same points.But the tears began to flow when her name - and Brooks' - appeared lit up in bronze on the big screen, tied on 6,581 points to become the first heptathletes to split a world medal.American Anna Hall claimed a breakthrough world title triumph and Ireland's Kate O'Connor held on for a historic silver, after three-time Olympic champion Nafi Thiam withdrew from the competition when ranked eighth earlier on Saturday.You can read Harry's full report here.Image source, Getty Images

Jenny Meadows on Max Burgin finishing in sixth in the men's 800m final: "I think Max didn't really do anything wrong. He did brilliant to get himself up to that third place. He tried to win the gold, he didn't just try to medal. "Unfortunately, he didn't have the gap and he got caught up with around 150m to 100m to go. He just couldn't find that gap. He thought about going on the inside, he came out wide and then obviously your legs are gone. He is running a personal best time but I do just think that was an opportunity missed. I do know he's good enough."

Max Burgin speaking to BBC Sport after finishing sixth in the men's 800m final: "In a sense [I am proud ] winning personal best pretty means you're operating close to maximum. If I were to have got that time in any other race this year I would have been buzzing but in that one there it just feels disappointing really. It's just wasn't meant to be. "Positioning wise even up until 600m I thought I was in a good spot but with 200m to go
I should've moved wide earlier because I couldn't get through. "When I come to terms with this race I think I'll look back on this season and be happy with what I've achieved. It wasn't to be today but that doesn't reflect on the season as a whole."

Before the 800m, we had the final event in the first half of the decathlon.Ayden Owens-Delerme absolutely stormed out of the blocks in the final heat of the 400m. Having established a big lead he stalled on the final straight, but managed to hold off Harrison Williams of the United States.That takes the Puerto Rican into third in the overall standings, behind American Kyle Garland.Sander Skotheim of Norway and Leo Neugebauer, second and third in the standings going into this event, finish fourth and sixth here - although the heats are seeded, so six of the seven fastest times were in this race.That brings the decathlon to a close for today - we'll return tomorrow for the final five events.

What a final.A championship record, national records and lifetime bests all over the shop.A personal best for Max Burgin, too. He went for gold and, somehow, one minute 42.29 seconds only gets you sixth these days.He remains the third-fastest Brit in history but edges closer to Sebastian Coe's British record. Relief for the current World Athletics president. But Burgin is coming...Image source, Getty Images
