Image source, Getty Images1500m silver medallist Jake Wightman of Great Britain speaking to BBC Sport: "I knew I still had something in me. I knew I was gong to run to try and win today and whatever happened, I would be happy. "When you get that close you cannot help but think what if I had done more? But I left everything out there. "It has been a few bleak years so making this team was the main thing. "I have made some big changes in my life this year. Getting a new coach and moving to Manchester. I hoped they were for the best and now that the big stage is here, I stepped up. "I want to thank my coaching team and my Dad. It will be awhile to process this. "I believe that you get what you pay for in the end. I am so happy that all the persistence has been worth it. "I felt like I had another gear all these Championships but I did not know what would happen. This silver is a gold for me and I am so relieved."

Great Britain's Neil Gourley speaking to BBC Sport after finishing tenth in the 1500m final: "That was a really tough field to be in. I had bigger goals in it. "I wasn't in a terrible spot with 300 metres to go. Normally I can change gears but today I felt tired. I just did not have it.
"I have exceeded expectations and had my best form when it counted. Given where I was a few weeks ago, I am proud of where I have ended up."
