GB's Amber Anning speaking to BBC Sport after finishing fifth in the 400m final: "I was a bit disappointed but I gave it my best effort. That is the fastest I've ran all year. I had great progression through the rounds"I felt like the race got away from me a little bit. I finished, I'm proud, fifth in the world you can't complain. I have so much more to give, I'm looking forward to resting up and going again next season."

Extraordinary.Marileidy Paulino set a new national record, even quicker than the time in which she won Olympic gold.Third, fourth and Amber Anning in fifth all ran season best times.GB's Anning could not have done any more.

The weather isn't great. The rain continues to fall, there's the occasional gust of wind.But Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone is just that good that you just wouldn't bet against her still putting in a record-breaking performance here.For 40 years the women's 400m record has gone untouched.Amber Anning is in the rather unfortunate position of having McLaughlin-Levrone in the lane immediately on her inside and probably just needs to ignore what's happening in lane five in the early stages of this.Salwa Eid Naser and Marileidy Paulino are the third and fourth fastest athletes of all time in this event. This could be insanely quick.

Reigning Olympic and world champion Marileidy Paulino would ordinarily be the favourite, but the signs throughout the heats and semi-finals suggested that Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone could steal her title.The American's primary event is the 400m hurdles, but in July she made the decision to chose the flat event in Tokyo.After clocking a world-leading and American record time of 48.29 seconds in the semi-finals - over a second faster than her nearest rival, Amber Anning of Great Britain - it's hard to look past the 26-year-old.Coincidentally, the last person to beat her in a flat 400m race was Paulino in the Paris Diamond League meeting in June 2023.Anning was excellent in the semi-finals, and has every chance of winning a medal in her first individual event final at a World Championships.It's worth keeping tabs on Salwa Eid Naser as well - the 27-year-old from Bahrain won the silver medal in Paris last summer, and is the only athlete in the world to dip below the 49 second mark on four occasions this year.

A thrilling conclusion to the women's triple jump, as Cuba's Leyanis Perez Hernandez holds off a high quality field to take gold.Perez has five of the top
six jumps this year and won the world indoor title in March, and she triumphs in Tokyo with a distance of 14.94m from her fourth jump.Dominica's Thea Lafond snatched silver with her final leap, ahead of Venezuela's Yulimar Rojas who takes bronze.
