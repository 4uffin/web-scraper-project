The last time a Jamaican got the title was in 2016 and that was Usain Bolt so I
am really happy knowing that I actually got the gold medal and I have proved
myself that I am a true competitor and I showed my resilience and my fight and determination."Everyone was saying in the
first round that I am panicking, but I know what I am going through in that
moment and I just brushed it aside and proved to myself that I am the champion."

Noah Lyles has managed and navigated this season a little bit differently to previous seasons. He arrived here as the reigning world champion in this event, but actually you could see in his face at the end that he was delighted to pick up a medal.His game face was that he wanted to win gold, but he was happy to get that bronze.

We always had the hope there for Oblique Seville. We saw how confident he was coming out of the semi-finals and he came out hard, drove through and fought to the very last second for this gold medal.He kept his composure and belief which shows that he's obviously a very confident runner.

Melissa Jefferson-Wooden is the hunted now, without a doubt.She's had the most fantastic season, she's performed consistently throughout the year and she's come into the World Championships probably not seeing herself as the favourite. I was certainly looking at her as one of the favourites though.The way she ran the final was brilliant. The whole field is fast - they are all such fast women in their own rights - and she almost put them to shame. It was incredible to watch.

Jamaica's Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce speaking to BBC Sport: "Last year I didn't get to go to the line and I was devastated. Being able to get to the finals was a big accomplishment in itself. Looking forward to the 4x100, maybe when I head home I'll have all the feels!"It felt really good. I've given so much to this sport. A lot of people may question why I came back, but it's important to finish on your own terms and it's a big blessing to be able to do that."

Great Britain's Dina Asher-Smith speaking to BBC Sport: "I would have loved some quicker times. It's just been a very different year for me. Moving half-way through the year is not always the easiest thing to do. I'm a competitor, I know I've run faster than that all season."I believe in myself, I know I need to have the space and capacity to perform. I would not have had the Zurich final I would have had if I hadn't made that change."

A lot of preparation, hard work, faith in my coaches. At the end of the day I focused on my execution."I felt myself get out [ahead], then I blacked out after that, thinking 'get to the line'."I saw my time and it hit me, oh my gosh I won!"I came in as a hunter, I've never been a world champion or Olympic champion in the 100m."There will be a target on my back next year so I'll work out how to navigate that."

For any Jamaican athlete in the sprints, you are following on from one of the greatest of all-time so there is inevitably added pressure. Every time they step on the track, they have to deal with the pressure of a nation that absolutely love their sprints.Oblique Seville and Kishane Thompson have absolutely chewed that pressure up, swallowed it and done exactly what needed to be done.That was so unbelievably exciting.

What a way to win the gold medal!I think there was a lot of personal pressure on Oblique Seville. Everybody else was looking at Kishane Thompson and Noah Lyles for this title, but Seville has been running well all season.He came to these World Championships with only good performances under his belt and he has been getting more and more confident throughout this season. I'm very happy for the young man.

Jamaica have a new champion - a world champion!All the nerves, doubts and talking - banished in 9.7 seconds. United States have owned this event for a while, but Jamaica have taken it back.There was daylight between top two Oblique Seville and Kishane Thompson and third-placed Noah Lyles.

Wow! Take a deep breath everybody because that was a sensational set of sprinting right the way across the board.Melissa Jefferson-Wooden was outstanding. Julien Alfred just couldn't get anywhere near her because she got out of the blocks so well. Her first 10 metres were aggressive, but she kind of hides all of her power because she is just so silky smooth.When Jefferson-Wooden puts her foot down, she just propels herself forward.
