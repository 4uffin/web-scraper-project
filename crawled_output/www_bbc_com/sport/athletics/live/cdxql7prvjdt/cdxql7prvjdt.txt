Ultimately, it is a championships in which GB have fallen short of their targets.There has of course been some misfortune among the disappointment, with medal hopes Molly Caudery and Josh Kerr both suffering injuries.But the British team will have to head home and lick their wounds, aware next year - World Athletics' new Ultimate Championships aside - offers a break from a run of five global championships in as many years.We have a strange ending to the championships, with most of the crowd remaining in their seats as we wait for the discus final to resume amid the pouring rain and flashes of lightning above Tokyo.All in all, there have been some truly memorable moments - not least Mondo Duplantis' magical world record with his final attempt as the whole stadium stayed behind to watch.

Image source, Getty ImagesIt has to be [a springboard to do better]. We talk about the year after an Olympics being a funny year, whether that's through injuries or changes. There's a lot going on but, we can't deny the fact we're disappointed. No relay medals. We expected a few more opportunities and we've come away with five medals which we've got to celebrate because they were fantastic performances. But we can't get away from the fact we've not taken a gold from these championships and that's tough.

Personally it's got to be the women's 800m from a GB perspective. Just to see both of the athletes who I've coached take it all the way to the line and both to execute their race strategies absolutely perfectly. So incredibly proud of them. Image source, Getty Images

Image source, Getty ImagesThe championships have been a rollercoaster. So many things have happened. But for me, from a GB perspective, my highlight is Amy Hunt - she has been sensational. She's had such a fantastic year and she's been able to translate that into a global medal for the first time. For me, that 200m performance was really the showstopper of the week. She says she is not the best starter but she is the best finisher of that 200m. She was so shocked to get silver and I love the most that we really got behind her journey.

We've talked about individuals and what happens the year after the Olympic Games when every single shot you have comes off. Sometimes you can get lulled into that false sense of security thinking 'we're there and consistent and we can keep doing it'. The women will be incredibly disappointed because that's the best team we can put out. Four women in brilliant shape.Dina [Asher-Smith] handled herself so well on her first leg and Amy [Hunt] had the best leg out of all second-leg runners and Desiree [Henry] ran well but the United States and Jamaica got ahead of us. We lost a medal by two tenths and it was probably that final changeover [that did it]. It will be disappointing.

"We gave it our all. Obviously, we wanted gold, that's all we aim for. We will go back and look back and analyse. It's not necessarily a disappointment. It's just about learning, going forward and increasing it next time."We always want to be on top of the podium and I'm speaking for every relay team out there. We have high expectations, so what were going to do especially pushing forward to LA is work hard stay disciplined and come out and smash it."

What impact did the lane draw have on that women's 4x100m relay? Germany had the drier lane and the Brits were in the wet - could that have played a part in them edging us out?Lisa, Essex

The women's high jump final is back under way, with Nicola Olyslagers, Maria Zodzik and Yaroslava Mahuchikh trying to sort out the order of the medals. It looks like Australian Matthew Denny's failed attempt in the first round of the men's discus - the only attempted throw before the competition was stopped - has been wiped from the record.
