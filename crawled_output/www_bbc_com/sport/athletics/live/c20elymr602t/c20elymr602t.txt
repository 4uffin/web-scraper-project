Great Britain's 4x400m mixed relay team finished fifth, with the United States taking the title ahead of the Netherlands.
Ryan Crouser took the men's shot put title, with Great Britain's Scott Lincoln in fifth, while Evan Dunfee of Canada and Maria Perez secured the men's and women's 35km race walk competitions.
All the favourites and every British athlete progressed through the men's and women's 100m heats, with the semi-finals and final to come tomorrow.
Great Britain's Jazmin Sawyers went out in the women's long jump qualification, while repeat record breaker Armand Duplantis of Sweden progressed in the men's pole jump.
If you're a night owl then the women's marathon starts at 23:30 tonight, while you can join us tomorrow for those 100m finals, plus medal events in the women's discus and long jump, plus the men's 10,000m final and plenty more heats and qualification.That all gets going from 10:00 BST - we'll see you then.

I don't need to ask what you'll be doing with your Sunday afternoons after this, do I?A big change made to the schedule - one World Athletics president Sebastian Coe says was discussed at length - is to hold both the men's and women's 100m finals on the same night at these championships.Not only that, but they will start just seven minutes apart.It promises to be a blockbuster conclusion to night two that you do not want to miss, with the semi-finals coming up just after midday in the UK.Based on the atmosphere we've witnessed tonight, it could be very special.

If we look at the four athletes who ran for Great Britain and Northern Ireland, none of them are in the individual 400m competition.Our three women and three men have chosen to focus on their individual races which is obviously fair enough, but they will be disappointed with being 0.23 seconds away from a medal.

Lewis Davey speaking to BBC Sport after Great Britain finished fifth in the mixed 4x400m relay final:"Not so great, it was a similar situation to this morning's run. I haven't been able to find my rhythm and I made it much harder for the team."Emily Newnham:"I feel like there was two ways I could have looked at this championship. One was to focus on the hurdels, the other was to get as much experience and soak up what I can, and get on the track as many times as possible. I'm grateful for that opportunity. I know I'm stepping into a team that is so established, so I'm grateful and happy."Toby Harries:"Horrible legs! I'm a 200m and 400m guy, so if I'm going to overtake it's in the first 200m. I had a lot of work to do, I got the baton in fifth. We're here to win medals, we're GB, we're not here to just compete. I went out as hard as I could to try and hold it. I just didn't have that end-game. Still, a 42.2 split was better than this morning. I wish I could have held it that last 30, 40 metres a bit more.Nicole Yeargin:"My split wasn't what I wanted it to be, I was a bit slower than this morning. I should have had more confidence in myself to overtake on the back stretch - I thought I could ride and pick it up, but I realised that's not how this works."She [Femke Bol] knows she can close hard, I think they just kept that steady speed. I should have trusted myself and overtaken her when I could. I almost tripped her, clashes spikes, I hope we do better in the men's and women's relays."

Great Britain will obviously come away disappointed. We perhaps hoped they might have been a little bit more in the mix than they were. It felt like they had dropped quite far behind at some stages, Tony Harries had to work quite hard on his leg and we saw him go out very fast.Overall it was a very tough race. The Netherlands and United States were so far ahead. They were fantastic and there were some huge times ran there, so it was always going to be difficult.I do feel there is some disappointment there for Great Britain, they could've performed slightly better.

We did say this was going to be an electric final after the qualifying rounds.United States certainly stepped it up to take that gold medal. We were in hope that Great Britain could just magic something up, but there were just so many strong runners. The Netherlands worked so well as a team and delivered their performances.A great race - this is what we like to see.

There were a lot of questions around whether the mixed relay is a good addition, but over the past few years we've seen that it is a great way to start the World Championships. Great Britain are doing fantastic in this event, so we definitely want to see it keep going!The United States and the Netherlands obviously have very strong teams, but Great Britain are looking great. I'm excited to see what they can produce here and hopefully they come away with a medal.
