To do it in the style that he has with Emmanouil Karalis chasing - he is a showman. You have got to love the drama.

Armand Duplantis puts on a show every time he comes out on the track. Emmanouil Karalis pushed him as far as he could.No-one knows his limits. He is hitting big heights in training but who knows how high he will go? There are a few years of world records in him, for sure.

Image source, Getty ImagesWe used to say that we needed Usain Bolt here to bring some interest to athletics. Duplantis is a superstar and is transcending the sport.
Pole vault draws you in, and that is why Armand is a showman. He orchestrates it. He would have loved a first attempt world record. It is great for the sport and long may he go higher.

He always delivers. When he put that out there, that he wants to do 6.30m, there must be doubts in his head. He ran to every single side of the stadium, he saluted the crowd. These scenes are amazing to watch.

Argghhhhh so close!! Armand Duplantis looks to have broken the world record with his second attempt at 6.30 metres, but his chest clips the bar on the way back down. The height was there!He'll make one more attempt - third time lucky?

Image source, Getty ImagesIn case you're wondering why Armand Duplantis only attempts world records in one centimetre increments:Given that athletes receive a $100,000 (Â£74,000) bonus every time they break a world record, it makes financial sense for Duplantis to nudge his record by small amounts.Also, it's pretty difficult to reach the heights Duplantis does!

Image source, Getty ImagesPole vault always ends in failure. But that was no failure for Emmanouil Karalis. He had a blip at 5.95m and will have had some personal doubts but he was able to get through it. There is more to come from him.
