"It has been a challenge here because, of course, post-Olympic Games we lost the warm-up track we used during the Games."It is a little bit further away and we have had to deal with traffic flows at different times of the day, different days of the week."We have really looked at that. It isn't perfect, but I think the athletes are now recognising we've done everything we possibly could to make it as good as possible."'Not befitting the Worlds'To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.This video can not be playedMedia caption, Hodgkinson and Hunter-Bell reach 800m finalOn Friday, after securing her place in Sunday's 800m final, Hodgkinson said she may have to change her routine.She said: "With the whole warm-up situation, you're warming up for almost two hours. "It can be quite draining, so maybe we will have to look at doing something better come Sunday."Last week, American middle-distance runner Nikki Hiltz described it as "weird", adding: "It's definitely not usual, but we're all in the same boat." Jamaican coach Stephen Francis was more critical. In an interview with his country's TVJ news channel, Francis described what he felt were a number of logistical issues, including the "distance from the stadium to the warm-up track".He added: "Those areas of a meet are not befitting the top meet of the year for World Athletics."A World Athletics statement said: "The athlete experience is of utmost importance for World Athletics and the local organising committee at these World Athletics Championships, and we have put a lot of consideration into their preparations within the constraints of locations and venues."This type of configuration is not unique - as we have seen from previous Olympic Games and other major athletics championships."The rules regarding warm-up, call room and transport apply to every team and every athlete without exception."The brilliant performances we have seen so far from the athletes speak for themselves."Gene testing 'here to stay'In his interview with BBC Sport, Coe also confirmed all female athletes competing at the championships have undergone new gene testing.And at a news conference on Sunday, he confirmed the tests would continue at future events."Let me be clear, the gene test is here to stay," he said.Rules requiring all athletes in the female category of world ranking events to take a one-time gene test came into force at the beginning of September.World Athletics says the sex screening - which detects the presence of a Y chromosome - is to protect the integrity of women's competition.Coe could not confirm if any athletes had been prevented from competing as a result of the test, carried out via cheek swab, as such discussions are only held between the athlete and a relevant medical delegate.The move comes amid reports, external that between 50 and 60 athletes who went through male puberty have been finalists in the female category at global and continental athletics championships since 2000.Coe said: "We have achieved what we set out to do, all our female athletes have been tested."Yes there were some challenges, it was quite a concertinaed time frame, but the vast majority of the athletes and all the member federations really stepped up and helped us do this."It's the right thing to do if you really are committed to promoting and preserving the female category and by implication women's sport."Related topicsAthleticsTop storiesGuardiola gamble almost pays off as Liverpool cash inPublished5 hours agoCox leads England to T20 series win over IrelandPublished8 hours agoPiastri 'drops ball' but did Norris miss opportunity?Published7 hours agoloading elsewhere storiesElsewhere in SportGB fail to win gold for first time in 20 years - where it went wrongMartinelli snatches late draw for Arsenal against Man City.
