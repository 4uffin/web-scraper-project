I just really wanted to enjoy being back in the stadium. It's so nice to be here," Hodgkinson told BBC Sport."It wasn't pretty or dominant, but it's nice to be safely through. It's been a long week waiting around. Whoever put the 800m last, thank you."I've just been looking forward to getting out here, at one point I didn't even know if I'd be here. It definitely means a lot, round by round I'm hoping it goes my way."It would mean even more than last year [to win]. I'm just trying to embrace it all."Hodgkinson won her heat in a comfortable one minute 59.79 seconds - a time more than five seconds slower than her British record.Olympic 1500m bronze medallist Hunter Bell, who chose to switch focus to the shorter of the middle-distance events in pursuit of another global podium, also began with victory, clocking 1:58.82.Hunter Bell told BBC Sport: "We have been out in Japan for a long time, so it felt like Christmas morning getting out on track. "Doing the 800m is the right decision. I feel like I have really got something to show - I have a high ranking and with my team-mate this was the year to do it."Gold medal threats remain in the shape of Kenya's reigning champion Mary Moraa, Ethiopia's Olympic silver medallist Tsige Duguma and in-form Swiss athlete Audrey Werro.However, British team-mate Jemma Reekie missed out after placing fifth in her heat.Anning misses out as McLaughlin-Levrone starsTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.This video can not be playedMedia caption, McLaughlin-Levrone wins 400m goldGreat Britain's Amber Anning finished fifth in the women's 400m final, in which American hurdles star Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone went close to breaking a 40-year record in claiming a stunning gold.McLaughlin-Levrone, a two-time Olympic and world 400m hurdles champion, hinted that she could threaten German Marita Koch's controversial 1985 record of 47.60 seconds by breaking Sanya Richards-Ross' United States record in the semi-finals. In wet conditions at Japan's National Stadium, the 26-year-old 400m hurdles record holder clocked the second-fastest 400m flat time in history with 47.78.
