I thank God that I was strong today."I just wanted to run comfortable without pushes and falls, because I was a little bit scared seeing people falling. I just wanted to be by myself and run my race."GB medal hopes dented as Hudson-Smith exits 400mPublished5 days agoWorld Athletics: Recap as Kipyegon wins 1500m gold on day fourWorld Athletics medal table - and what's on Wednesday?Published11 hours ago'There's nothing anyone can do to stop her'With outstretched arms and a relaxed smile which suggested it had never felt in doubt, Kipyegon celebrated the eighth global gold of her career.That is level with Jamaican sprint star Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce - the only other woman to win as many as four world titles in the same event - and distance running great Tirunesh Dibaba for the most by a female athlete in individual events.Kipyegon will now target a second successive world double in the 5,000m, the heats for which begin on Thursday before Saturday's final.She became the first woman to achieve that world 1500m-5,000m double two years ago.The competition in the women's 1500m is fierce, and was a factor in Great Britain's Olympic 1500m bronze medallist Georgia Hunter Bell's decision to prioritise the 800m in Japan.Yet it has been a long time since the destination of the gold medal was in doubt.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Faith Kipyegon has won eight global golds on the trackKipyegon has swept seven of the past eight global titles, with Sifan Hassan the last athlete to deny her at the 2019 World Championships in Doha.Keen to continue pushing the boundaries - and, as a mother, inspire young girls and women in particular - she made an ambitious bid to become the first woman in history to run a sub-four-minute mile in June.Although she came up short, she still ran 1.22 seconds faster than her personal best of 4:07.64 - the time which remains the official mile world record, and still five seconds faster than any other woman has run in history.Long before she was pursuing history in the latest high-tech shoes, Kipyegon would run barefoot to and from school in her village as a child. She even won her first global cross country title with nothing on her feet.The oldest woman to ever win a world 1500m title, she continues to go from strength to strength.Kipyegon began the year by just missing the world 1000m record in April, improved her 1500m world record to 3:48.68 in July, and was within a second of breaking the 3,000m record - which has stood for 32 years - in her final race before Tokyo.One night after Armand Duplantis soared to a 14th world record and third world title at Japan's National Stadium, this too appears a reign of dominance unlikely to end any time soon.Commentating on BBC TV, Andrew Cotter said: "I like the way she goes about this type of race. She can do a 58 last lap, the others can't. "She makes the third lap quicker than the second, the second quicker than the first. "It just means that there is nothing anyone else can do but survive, hang on."To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.This video can not be playedMedia caption, USA's Tinch storms to 110m hurdles goldTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.This video can not be playedMedia caption, Kerr soars to gold in men's high jump for New ZealandRelated topicsAthleticsMore on this storyWorld Athletics to 'remind' GB about rules over '100% Jesus' headbandPublished5 days agoComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 271Top storiesGuardiola gamble almost pays off as Liverpool cash inPublished5 hours agoCox leads England to T20 series win over IrelandPublished8 hours agoPiastri 'drops ball' but did Norris miss opportunity?Published6 hours agoloading elsewhere storiesElsewhere in SportGB fail to win gold for first time in 20 years - where it went wrongMartinelli snatches late draw for Arsenal against Man City.
