Today is a full circle moment for me, I was a reserve at my first world championships in Japan in 2007. I couldn't have it any other way. "I am grateful for the medals, the stadiums and the crowds where I have competed throughout my career. "I have some plans and I want to focus on advocacy, and support women and athletes. I want to continue to make an impact."World Athletics:

She became the oldest woman to claim a 100m world title in 2019, extending that record by three years aged 35 in Eugene,A two-time Olympic 100m champion, Fraser-Pryce said prior to the 2024 Olympic Games that she "owes" it to her family to retire.However, she was unable to achieve the fairytale ending she had hoped for. Having withdrawn before her 100m semi-final, she later revealed a disruption to her pre-race routine caused a panic attack after she struggled to gain entry to the warm-up track.Known as the 'The Pocket Rocket', the diminutive five-foot tall Fraser-Pryce was determined to end things on her own terms this year.She was able to do just that, finishing sixth in the 100m final - still within 0.19 seconds of a podium consisting of athletes aged at least 14 years her junior - before bowing out on the podium."I have given so much to this sport," Fraser-Pryce said after the 100m."A lot of people might question why come back [after giving birth], but I think it is so important to finish on your own terms."Last year I didn't get that opportunity, it was so hurtful, and for me it was just a big blessing to be able to do that. Maybe, when I head home, I will have all the feels."Hunter Bell edges out Hodgkinson as GB win 800m silver and bronzePublished14 hours agoGB fail to win gold amid worst return for 20 yearsPublished9 hours agoWorld Athletics medal table - and GB medallistsPublished12 hours agoThe impact she has was immediately evident both before and after the 100m.Japan's sold-out 60,000-capacity National Stadium unleashed the type of roar that had otherwise been reserved for the host nation's own athletes when Fraser-Pryce was announced to the crowd.Afterwards, 24-year-old winner Melissa Jefferson-Wooden, who went on to become the first woman since Fraser-Pryce in 2013 to win 100m and 200m gold at the same world championships, said she had been inspired by the Jamaican as a child, adding: "Shelly-Ann is the greatest of all time."The tributes to Fraser-Pryce have continued throughout the past nine days, as fellow athletes took the opportunity to acknowledge her historic achievements.Eight-time Olympic champion Usain Bolt, of course, has nothing but respect for his compatriot. His only complaint, he says, is that Fraser-Pryce has kept going long enough to make him look bad, eight years after he retired aged 30."There are no words to explain how great Shelly-Ann is," Bolt told BBC Sport."She's a legend in my book, she has proven again and again that she is one of the best in the world."She left, had a kid, came back to the sport and still dominated. "I'm happy to know and to see this greatness."Trinidadian former world 200m champion Ato Boldon said: "I think it is the 100m career by which all others will be measured."I think she is the greatest 100m sprinter of all time."Fraser-Pryce's World and Olympic medal haulOlympic Games3 x gold: 100m (2008, 2012), 4x100m relay (2020)4 x silver: 100m (2020), 200m (2012), 4x100m relay (2012, 2016)1 x bronze: 100m (2016)World Championships10 x gold: 100m (2009, 2013, 2015, 2019, 2022), 200m (2013), 4x100m relay (2009, 2013, 2015, 2019)6 x silver: 200m (2022), 4x100m relay (2007, 2011, 2022, 2023, 2025)1 x bronze: 100m (2023)Related topicsAthleticsTop storiesGuardiola gamble almost pays off as Liverpool cash inPublished5 hours agoCox leads England to T20 series win over IrelandPublished8 hours agoPiastri 'drops ball' but did Norris miss opportunity?Published7 hours agoloading elsewhere storiesElsewhere in SportGB fail to win gold for first time in 20 years - where it went wrongMartinelli snatches late draw for Arsenal against Man City.
