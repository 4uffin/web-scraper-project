four thanks to field goals, including a huge upset win for the Cleveland Browns against the Green Bay Packers.The Los Angeles Rams had a last-gasp field goal blocked by the Philadelphia Eagles and returned for a touchdown as the Super Bowl champions produced a huge comeback victory to remain unbeaten.Back-up quarterbacks had a day too, with Mac Jones steering the San Francisco 49ers to a 3-0 start, while familiar faces Carson Wentz and Marcus Mariota led blowout wins for the Minnesota Vikings and the Washington Commanders respectively.Block party keeps Eagles unbeatenImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Jordan Davis is larger than your average touchdown scorer in the NFLThe Rams dominated and led 26-7 in Philadelphia before the Eagles engineered their biggest home comeback since 1988, with Jalen Hurts finally being let off the leash in the second half as he threw his first touchdown passes of the season.Special teams made the difference, though, as the Eagles blocked two fourth-quarter field goal attempts.The second was a heartbreaker on the last kick of the game to win it for the Rams, as Jordan Davis not only blocked it but returned it 61 yards for a touchdown.At 336lb, he is the heaviest player to do so, and was clocked at 18.59mph by the NFL's Next Gen Stats.However unlikely it seemed at stages, the Eagles moved to 3-0 and have won 19 of their past 20 games.Browns leave it late to beat PackersGreen Bay led 10-0 with less than four minutes left in Cleveland before another wild ending helped the Browns win their first game of the season and end an eight-game losing run.Jordan Love threw his first interception for 10 regular-season games but looked to have redeemed himself by setting up Brandon McManus for a field goal to win it.The Browns blocked it before Joe Flacco got Andre Szmyt in range to boot a 55-yard kick for an improbable victory against one of the leading Super Bowl contenders.Mahomes shines for ChiefsPatrick Mahomes celebrated his recent 30th birthday by leading the Kansas City Chiefs to a first win of the campaign at the New York Giants.It was a tough task against a fierce pass rush in New York, but some vintage gunslinging throws from Mahomes helped the Chiefs pull away in the second half and claim a 22-9 win.Tyquan Thornton is emerging as Mahomes' top deep option as he caught a touchdown and set up the other with a brilliant deep diving grab.The Chiefs offence is still not the force of old, but there are signs of life, and they will need to improve again with the Baltimore Ravens up next.Tampa Bay kings of the late winnersImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Will McDonald scored from the blocked field goal return but it was not enough for the JetsWhen Will McDonald returned a blocked field goal for a touchdown, the New York Jets had erased a 17-point fourth-quarter deficit to lead by one in Tampa Bay.Baker Mayfield is perhaps the most underrated quarterback in the league, though, and led yet another late winner for the Buccaneers thanks to Chase McLaughlin's walk-off field goal.The Bucs moved to 3-0 for the first time in 20 years and are the first team in the Super Bowl era to win their first three games in the final minute of the match.It is 23 years since the Los Angeles Chargers last started 3-0 and, like the Bucs, they did it with the last kick of the game against the Denver Broncos.The Indianapolis Colts are a slightly more surprising 3-0 side, but the historic form of Daniel 'Indiana' Jones is even more of a shock as he is the first quarterback in the Super Bowl era to record three passing and three rushing touchdowns and no interceptions in his opening three games of a season.After hammering the Tennessee Titans 41-20, the Colts have six touchdowns and 10 field goals against only one punt in 26 possessions. It is time to take Jones and the Colts seriously.Jones leads as back-ups thriveAnother game and another last-kick winner as Mac Jones led the 49ers on a game-winning drive against Arizona to show he could still be an NFL starter as he stood in for Brock Purdy.Wentz started for a record sixth different team in six straight seasons as he helped Minnesota to their biggest win since 1998.Their 48-10 victory had more to do with the Cincinnati Bengals' ineptitude and the brilliance of Vikings cornerback Isaiah Rodgers, who scored touchdowns with an 87-yard interception return and 66-yard fumble return.Mariota was another back-up who tasted a big win on his first start for three years, with the Commanders 41-24 winners over the Las Vegas Raiders.Rodgers passes FavreThe big results and landmarks kept on coming as Aaron Rodgers passed Brett Favre with 510 regular-season touchdown passes. He is now fourth in the all-time list, and his 63,538 passing yards puts him in sixth.Even more importantly, Rodgers' Pittsburgh Steelers beat the error-strewn New England Patriots.Caleb Williams is the first player with 225 passing yards and three touchdowns in one half of a game this season, and he is looking more like a number one pick of the Draft.Williams gave new Chicago Bears head coach Ben Johnson his first win and the Dallas Cowboys plenty more questions to answer given the dominant nature of their 31-14 defeat.The Houston Texans dropped to a 0-3 start after a comedy of errors in the fourth quarter meant they lost at the Jacksonville Jaguars for the first time in eight years.The Seattle Seahawks were 44-13 winners against the New Orleans Saints, while, in another big surprise, the Carolina Panthers earned their first win of the season with a 30-0 shutout of the Atlanta Falcons.NFL week three results and highlightsAtlanta Falcons 0-30 Carolina PanthersGreen Bay Packers 10-13 Cleveland BrownsHouston Texans 10-17 Jacksonville JaguarsCincinnati Bengals 10-48 Minnesota VikingsPittsburgh Steelers 21-14 New England PatriotsLos Angeles Rams 26-33 Philadelphia EaglesNew York Jets 27-29 Tampa Bay BuccaneersIndianapolis Colts 41-20 Tennessee TitansLas Vegas Raiders 24-41 Washington CommandersDenver Broncos 20-23 Los Angeles ChargersNew Orleans Saints 13-44 Seattle SeahawksDallas Cowboys 14-31 Chicago BearsArizona Cardinals 15-16 San Francisco 49ersKansas City Chiefs 22-9 New York GiantsMiami Dolphins 21-31 Buffalo BillsTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.This video can not be playedMedia caption, Buffalo Bills 31-21 Miami Dolphins - highlightsRelated topicsSuper BowlAmerican FootballMore on this storyNFL fixtures and resultsGet American Football news sent straight to your phonePublished16 AugustComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 129Top storiesHow best in the world Dembele finally lived up to his potentialPublished4 hours agoWhy Spain's Bonmati won record third women's Ballon d'OrPublished4 hours agoHampton's rise to best keeper in the worldPublished5 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCYour first look at Alan Partridgeâs 'brave' new projectIs it time to copyright your face?The return of a trippy, comic joyrideHow did a duck help solve this 19th-century murder case?Elsewhere in SportHow best in the world Dembele finally lived up to his potentialWhy Spain's Bonmati won record third women's Ballon d'OrHampton's rise to best keeper in the worldHorner, the Â£52m pay-off, and what next for ex-Red Bull boss?How England 2025 boomed into biggest Women's Rugby World Cup everWhy Friday's opening session is likely to shape Ryder CupWhy do West Ham keep conceding from corners?GB fail to win gold for first time in 20 years - where it went wrongMartinelli snatches late draw for Arsenal against Man City.
