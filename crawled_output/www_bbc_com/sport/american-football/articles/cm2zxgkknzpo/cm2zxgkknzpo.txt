The defending champions look well primed for another big run this season - but the Chiefs have work to do.Game of the season contender in DallasTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.This video can not be playedMedia caption, Cowboys beat Giants in OT after epic fourth quarterWe're unlikely to see a fourth quarter like this one again this season, with the Cowboys and Giants scoring five touchdowns between them in the final 12 minutes of a spellbinding contest.After trading touchdown haymakers in a ridiculous spell of football, quarterback Russell Wilson delivered what looked the knockout blow - a brilliant 48-yard strike to Malik Nabers - with just 25 seconds on the clock.But Dallas climbed off the canvas like Tyson Fury against Deontay Wilder to somehow send it to overtime thanks to Brandon Aubrey's huge 64-yard field goal - the third longest in NFL history behind Justin Tucker's 66-yarder and his own 65-yard effort last season.Aubrey then finished the job with a 46-yarder to win it 40-37 as overtime expired - becoming the first player to hit a field goal with the last kick of regulation and the last kick of overtime. "Cool way to win your first game," said new Cowboys head coach Brian Schottenheimer after a game that will take some beating for drama this season. Colts claim history and incredible scenes in MiamiSpencer Shrader came up short with a 60-yard field goal for the Indianapolis Colts, but a penalty on the Denver Broncos moved it 15 yards closer for his second attempt - which he nailed for a 29-28 win in another game decided on the final kick.Quarterback Daniel Jones has been a revelation for the Colts with another all-action display helping Indianapolis to a first 2-0 start since 2009.The offensive production has been hugely impressive. After scoring on all seven possessions last week, the Colts took points from their first three drives against Denver to become the first team in NFL history to score on their first 10 possessions of the season.There were incredible scenes in Miami as the Dolphins took the lead thanks to a stunning 74-yard punt return touchdown from Malik Washington.But the New England Patriots then scored on the resulting kick-off thanks to Antonio Gibson's even better 90-yard touchdown run. That incredible back-to-back sequence has only happened once before in NFL history.The Patriots eventually won 33-27.Blowouts, back-ups and Burrow's toeImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Josh Allen took a whack on the nose but the Bills still cruised to victoryAaron Rodgers joined former team-mate Brett Favre on 508 career touchdown passes in the regular season, the fourth most of all time, in his home debut for the Pittsburgh Steelers, but it was ruined by a special teams kick-off calamity that helped the Seattle Seahawks walk away with the 31-17 victory.Josh Allen took a nasty whack on the nose but still led the Buffalo Bills to an expected blowout 30-10 win over the New York Jets, as did Lamar Jackson with four touchdowns in Baltimore's 41-17 beatdown of the Cleveland Browns.Detroit's Jared Goff led the fifth 50-point haul of his career as the Lions savaged the Chicago Bears - only three quarterbacks have had more.Mac Jones threw three touchdown passes as he covered for injured San Francisco 49ers starter Brock Purdy to get the win in New Orleans, but Jake Browning struggled with three interceptions when stepping in for injured Bengals star Joe Burrow.Browning did dive over for the winning touchdown with just 18 seconds on the clock, but all the talk in Cincinnati will be about how long Burrow's toe will keep him out - as their superstar quarterback left the ground on crutches.Top draft pick Cam Ward's first NFL touchdown pass was a beauty, but not enough to stop the Tennessee Titans getting overrun by the Los Angeles Rams, who with Davante Adams now joining Puka Nacua have possibly the best wide receiver duo in the league.Bijan Robinson had 168 total yards in the Atlanta's win in Minnesota, where the Falcons defence kept the Vikings out of the end zone and gave rookie JJ McCarthy nightmares with six sacks and two interceptions.The Arizona Cardinals were cruising at 27-3 but had to survive a big Carolina Panthers comeback to make a promising 2-0 start.NFL week two resultsCleveland Browns 17-41 Baltimore RavensJacksonville Jaguars 27-31 Cincinnati BengalsNew York Giants 37-40 Dallas Cowboys (OT)Chicago Bears 21-52 Detroit LionsNew England Patriots 33-27 Miami DolphinsSan Francisco 49ers 26-21 New Orleans SaintsBuffalo Bills 30-10 New York JetsSeattle Seahawks 31-17 Pittsburgh SteelersLos Angeles Rams 33-19 Tennessee TitansCarolina Panthers 22-27 Arizona CardinalsDenver Broncos 28-29 Indianapolis ColtsPhiladelphia Eagles 20-17 Kansas City ChiefsAtlanta Falcons 22-6 Minnesota VikingsWashington Commanders 18-27 Green Bay Packers - report & highlightsRelated topicsAmerican FootballMore on this storyPackers beat Commanders to maintain winning startPublished12 SeptemberRodgers' renaissance?Comments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 143Top stories'I flew 5,500 miles and paid Â£900 for a Premier League ticket but was turned away'Published7 hours agoLegendary umpire Bird dies aged 92Published20 minutes agoForty years on, how Jacklin revitalised Ryder CupPublished6 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCA respectable man leads a vicious 'firm' of thugsHow did PlayStation games help Rooney at Manchester United?Panorama investigates the desperate shortages of food in GazaKerry James Marshall, painter, shares his cultural influencesElsewhere in Sport'I flew 5,500 miles and paid Â£900 for a Premier League ticket but was turned away'Has modern football adopted the Allardyce playbook?
