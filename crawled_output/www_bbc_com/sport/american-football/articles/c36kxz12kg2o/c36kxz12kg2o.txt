Live text coverage every Sunday on BBC Sport website and app (from 18:00 BST), and live radio commentary of selected games on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and BBC Sounds, with Dallas Cowboys at Chicago Bears this Sunday (21:00)The Kansas City Chiefs and quarterback Patrick Mahomes are in unfamiliar territory.After being denied a Super Bowl three-peat in February, the Chiefs have lost their opening two games of the new season.It is the first time they have made an 0-2 start since 2014 - before they drafted Mahomes and their three Super Bowl wins under coach Andy Reid.There are now major questions over Kansas City's play-off hopes - as since the NFL merger in 1970, just 10.1% of teams who have made an 0-2 start have gone on to reach the post-season.Mahomes has welcomed the challenge, saying: "When you hit adversity, it's about how you deal with it. I'm excited for the next few weeks to see who wants to be challenged, and how we can get back and really get after it."So, is Chiefs Kingdom crumbling or can coach Reid keep it intact?Eagles beat Chiefs again & overtime epic in DallasPublished15 SeptemberWhy Super Bowl revenge looks a long shot for ChiefsPublished14 SeptemberWhat's gone wrong for Chiefs?To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.This video can not be playedMedia caption, Click above to watch this week's episode of The Whole 10 YardsKansas City came into the season having claimed a record 17 straight wins in one-score games â when the winning margin is eight points or fewer.But they have lost that knack, losing 27-21 in week one to the Los Angeles Chargers, their divisional rivals, and 20-17 in last Sunday's Super Bowl rematch with the Philadelphia Eagles.Ed Easton Jr, senior writer for USA Today's Chiefs Wire, told BBC Sport: "Chris Jones has always been great at defensive tackle, but he went for a sack on [Chargers quarterback] Justin Herbert when he just had to contain him. That's really uncharacteristic, and a moment like that leads to a loss."Then you have Travis Kelce, as sure-handed as can be. He basically fumbles the ball [against the Eagles], it deflects off his hand and it's intercepted. It changes the whole complexion of the game because if he catches that, it's a touchdown and we're probably not having this conversation."So when it comes down to those moments where you have to make big plays, they just haven't done it in these first two games."Poor discipline and a lack of key personnel have also been factors in Kansas City's slow start.Rashee Rice is serving a six-game suspension and fellow receiver Xavier Worthy dislocated a shoulder on the Chiefs' first drive of the season, while Kristian Fulton and now Mike Danna are injured on defence."The penalties have been racking up, a lot of them on right tackle Jawaan Taylor, who for the most part has been a disappointment since signing [in 2023]," Easton Jr added."Going through training camp and pre-season, Worthy was a part of so many more [offensive] schemes this year than last, so losing him threw them off. They really couldn't get some flow against the Chargers until the second half and Tyquan Thornton's not used to being a number one receiver."To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.This video can not be playedMedia caption, Herbert leads Chargers to victory over Chiefs in BrazilWhat changes have Chiefs needed?Arguably the most important position on the offensive line is left tackle as they protect the quarterback's blind side - or right tackle for a left-handed quarterback.After Mahomes was sacked six times in the Super Bowl - a career-high - the Chiefs remedied that by selecting Josh Simmons with their first-round draft pick, and they brought in Jaylon Moore from San Francisco."They have made adjustments on the offensive line, which was the biggest adjustment needed, and Josh Simmons has been playing so well as a rookie," said Easton."With regards to discipline, I think it comes down to how much patience Andy Reid has at right tackle and do they go with Jaylon Moore [instead of Taylor]?"The Chiefs also need an answer in their run game - as after being their third-leading rusher last season, Mahomes is currently their rushing leader.The 30-year-old is the second quarterback since 1950 to record double the rushing yards of any other team-mate in each of their first two games - after Cam Newton (2020) - putting him at greater risk of injury."Mahomes knows when he needs to get that first down or perhaps lower his shoulder and deliver a big blow on a defender," said NFL pundit Phoebe Schecter. "But you don't [always] want that for your star quarterback."To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.This video can not be playedMedia caption, Nabers stars in NFL plays of the weekHave Chiefs lowered expectations?Worthy returned to practice this week so could play in Sunday's prime-time game at the New York Giants, who are also 0-2 but almost beat the Dallas Cowboys in an overtime thriller last Sunday.Kansas City then host Baltimore next week, plus Detroit in week six, and are already playing catch-up in the AFC West."The Chiefs are going into this game and the rest coming up knowing that each is a must-win, because the Chargers went two games up on them after beating the [Las Vegas] Raiders last week," said Easton."But the Chiefs rise to the occasion when everyone's starting to doubt them. They dealt with adversity in the 2023 season when they were a wildcard team and won all those games on the road to win the Super Bowl."They're going to have to play the underdog role if they're to dig themselves out of this 0-2 hole, but Patrick Mahomes loves these moments."If the Chiefs miss out on a 10th straight division title, they can still reach the play-offs with enough wins to clinch a wildcard spot, but the AFC West is now "one of the NFL's most competitive divisions"."There's that parity in the NFL," added Schecter. "If you finish last, then you get to pick first [in the draft], and AFC teams have had to build a roster to take down the Chiefs."But when you've got Patrick Mahomes at the helm, and Andy Reid, one of the most incredible head coaches in NFL history, I think you always have a chance."I just think perhaps the goalpost has moved for what success might look like for them."From worst to first - why hope springs eternal in the NFL Published29 AugustNFL team-by-team guide 2025: Who are the Super Bowl contenders?Published22 AugustWhat information do we collect from this quiz?Related topicsAmerican FootballMore on this storyNFL fixtures and resultsGet American Football news sent straight to your phonePublished16 AugustComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 142Top storiesMcIlroy & Fleetwood reunite in Ryder Cup foursomesPublished5 hours agoAmerica's gladiator - DeChambeau's road to Ryder Cup talismanPublished4 hours agoBarcelona come from behind to beat Cazorla's OviedoElsewhere on the BBCThe gang who stole over Â£50 million from taxpayersDrs Chris and Xand get to the bottom of back painStacey and Joe welcome you back to Pickle CottageMatcha: From centuries-old tradition to global health trendElsewhere in SportWhere Ryder Cup battle will be won and lostThe battles England need to win in World Cup finalMartin feels heat again, but are Rangers players letting him down?
