Image source, Getty ImagesMcLaren's Lando Norris reduced team-mate Oscar Piastri's championship lead to 25 points by finishing seventh in the Azerbaijan Grand Prix after the Australian crashed out on the first lap.Red Bull's Max Verstappen took a dominant victory to underline McLaren's fears that he could become a title contender - even if he is still 69 points behind Piastri with seven races to go.But Piastri's first big mistake of the season was not as costly as it could have been, because main rival Norris was unable to make any ground from his seventh position on the grid.Norris became stuck behind other cars and could gain just six points on Piastri.McLaren tried an offset strategy with a late pit stop in the attempt to give Norris a tyre advantage in the closing laps.Read the full report here

Image source, Getty ImagesCelebrations for Red Bull, Mercedes and Williams tonight, while McLaren will be licking their wounds following a pretty rubbish weekend across the board. Over at Ferrari, Lewis Hamilton is downcast after the bright spot of topping Friday practice disappeared. How does he feel after that race? "Not good," he tells Sky Sports. "Our ultimate pace was just not on par with the guys up ahead of us." Plenty to mull over for teams and drivers in the two weeks before the Singapore Grand Prix. Join us again from the 3-5 October under the dazzling floodlights of the Marina Bay Street Circuit. First practice on the Friday starts at 10:30 BST. See you soon!

His latest race buddy Alex Albon was also at the podium presentation to cheer on the Spaniard, who has had a difficult start to life in his new surroundings. This is also Williams' first time on the podium since George Russell's second place at the rain-delayed Belgian Grand Prix in 2021.

Image source, Getty ImagesMcLaren boss Andrea Stella reflected on the team's struggles and told Sky Sports when it came to Lando Norris, they just didn't give him a fast enough car to overtake, "so we spent the whole race stuck in traffic," he added. "The slow pit stop certainly didnât help, but whether it was decisive for position, weâll have to review. We also stayed out as long as possible hoping for a safety car, which isnât unlikely here, even if today it only came at the start."

Image source, Getty ImagesLando Norris, who finished in seventh, speaking to Sky Sports: "I did the best I could yesterday and today, the opportunities are there every weekend. Every race I didn't win was an opportunity missed, so of course today I wanted more."I couldn't do anything more today, it was lost yesterday because of going out a bit early, not doing the best lap and we maybe could have gained a couple of positions."It wouldn't have changed anything today, it was just impossible to overtake. The pace was alright today when it needed to be, I did a long stint on the medium [tyre]. Things could have been a little bit better, but if there was anything I could have changed, probably not."On the rest of the field: "Red Bull are clearly doing well, their race pace is strong and they've still won plenty of races this year so it's not a surprise. "They have improved in some areas and they are a winning team for the last however many years. We knew they could be a threat and we know that some of these tracks are not going to be our best."

Championship leader Oscar Piastri, who suffered a DNF in Baku, told Sky Sports: "It was certainly not my finest moment, just anticipated the start too much and a silly, simple error with that really. "With the crash I just didn't anticipate the dirty air in the way I should have. I clearly went in to the corner way too hot and that was that."The grip level was low but I should know that, so I'm certainly not blaming it on anything other than myself. I didn't make the judgement calls that I needed to at the right time and that is obviously disappointing."On the weekend overall: "Friday was a tough day, Saturday the potential was very good, I had a lot of sectors that were incredibly strong but I just never got it all together. "Qualifying was what it was and today was more silly mistakes, so it was certainly a messy weekend. I would be more concerned if I was slow and trying to make up for it that way and having these errors because of that. "The fact that they are just simple lapses in judgement, it's obviously not a position I want to be, especially the mechanics because it has been a rough weekend for them. If I'm trying to find a silver lining, I suppose I have that."

Oscar Piastri speaking to Sky Sports on the championship gap narrowing: "I guess it is what it is, I'm not too concerned about that. For me, I'm solely focused on myself and what I can do to improve. There's still a long way to go and if you have good or bad weekends, the championship is far from over."

Lando Norris didn't finish on the podium today but six points is better than nothing. Overhauling Piastri might be a step too far - 69 points - but Max Verstappen's eye-catching form has inched him closer to second-placed Norris, with the Dutchman in third only 44 points away from the Briton's total. 1.

It's even better than my first ever podium that I had. "We've been fighting hard all year and finally today we just proved that we have the speed and we've had it all year. "Everything comes together and we can do some amazing things together and today we nailed the race, not one mistake, and we managed to beat a lot of cars that yesterday I wasn't expecting to beat."On the performance of the car: "I'm extremely proud of everyone at Williams for pushing through a very difficult year. "I think we've proven to everyone the massive step compared to last year and we are on the rise and in the right direction. "Unfortunately with me we've had a lot of back luck, lots of incidents and very difficult to convert all that pace into results."I now understand why it all happened because the first podium needed to come like this and it's just life. Life just sometimes brings you those bad moments to give you a very nice one."

"In the race the car was working really well on both of the compounds, we had clean air all the time and you could then look after your tyres. "It was pretty straightforward, it's not easy around here and it's very windy today so the car is always moving around a lot. I'm very happy with this performance."On the race: "You always have to be a little more careful with tyre management and stuff, you want to make the one-stop work so I think everyone was a bit more cautious with that anyway. "The medium and hard compounds that we were running today, they weren't really used that much up until today and that all helped. I was happy that there were not too many safety cars."On the cars competitiveness: "It's difficult to say at the moment but the last two race weekends have been amazing for us. Singapore is a completely different challenge again with the higher downforce, so we will see what we can do there."
