The McLaren boys make way for a Ferrari one-two in this second session. Lewis Hamilton tops the hour with a quickest time of 1:41.293, which is 0.074 seconds faster than his Scuderia team-mate Charles Leclerc. Up next is the two Mercedes drivers, George Russell in third and Kimi Antonelli in fourth, while Oliver Bearman ends his day on fifth place.

Haas have got two cars running in the top 10 in this second practice session. Ollie Bearman is still fifth while Esteban Ocon, who celebrated his 29th birthday this week, is sitting in eighth. Charles Leclerc reaches Turn Four but the Monegasque driver is coming in too hot, so he heads into the run-off instead.

Oscar Piastri is going to be investigated after the session for a yellow-flag infringement. What did the Australian do that caught the stewards' eye? I'm not sure. Hopefully we'll find out before the session ends. The circuit is busy now, minus Lando Norris, who is stuck in the garage while his car is being patched-up. Lewis Hamilton is completing his plan on the medium tyre, his team-mate Charles Leclerc is still on the soft C6.

Into the final 10 minutes and George Russell is making his way out of the pit lane and onto the track for the last bit if running. Oliver Bearman is already there, but the Haas man once again bails to the run-off area at Turn Eight. "These **** brakes," says the British rookie to his pit wall.

Kimi Antonelli was given some tough love by Mercedes boss Toto Wolff after his performance at Monza - he was another driver who picked up a penalty point at the Italian Grand Prix - but the Italian rookie looks brighter in this second Baku session and is running in fourth spot, one place behind his team-mate George Russell, with a 1:41.779 on the soft compound.

Will we see Lando Norris again in this session? With 19 minutes to go, his car is now and being worked on by his team of mechanics as the action continues around him. Out on track, George Russell goes third in the Mercedes, four-tenths away from Charles Leclerc and Oliver Bearman has put in a great lap on the medium to sit fourth.

McLaren are certainly pushing during this second practice session, which has its pros and cons. "Yeah, I touched the wall. I don't know if I have any damage," says Oscar Piastri after a brush with the barriers at Turn 15. The Australian is then told, like tam-mate Lando Norris a few moments earlier, to limp home.
