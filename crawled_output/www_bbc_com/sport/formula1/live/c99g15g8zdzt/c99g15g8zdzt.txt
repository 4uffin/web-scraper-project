Image source, Getty ImagesRed Bull's Max Verstappen took pole position ahead of Williams' Carlos Sainz after an extraordinary qualifying session featuring a record six red flags at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix.McLaren's championship rivals Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris will start seventh and ninth, the Australian after crashing in the final part of qualifying and Norris failing to produce a good final lap.Sainz was on course for pole position after being the fastest of three drivers to set a time before Ferrari's Charles Leclerc crashed early in the final part of qualifying.Piastri then crashed shortly after the session was restarted, and Verstappen was the only driver able to improve on Sainz's time when the session restarted for the final time with just over three minutes remaining.Racing Bulls' Liam Lawson will start third, with the lap time he set behind Sainz in the first part of the session.Read the full report here

Image source, Getty ImagesCarlos Sainz and Liam Lawson posing for the top-three qualifying photo - Baku delivers again. The blustery conditions in Azerbaijan have played their role in today's pole position fight and the forecast looks pretty similar for Sunday's 51-lap grand prix, so this could be an opportunity for an outsider to pop champagne on the podium. And what of the drivers' championship? Oscar Piastri leads Lando Norris by 31 points but the pair are starting out of position at the back of the top 10. For McLaren to be crowned constructors' champions tomorrow, the team need to outscore second-placed Ferrari by nine points, while not being outscored by Mercedes by 12 points or more, and Red Bull by 33 points or more.It's an early start on Sunday, so come back and join us for race build-up from 11:00 BST. Lights out is at 12:00 BST. See you tomorrow!

Image source, Getty ImagesFerrari's Charles Leclerc qualified in 10th after crashing. He told Sky Sports: "I think Lewis [Hamilton] was a bit more on the pace straight away and more consistent than I've been during the weekend. I've been massively struggling, which normally I come to Baku and everything flows pretty naturally."This year unfortunately it was not the case, I don't understand why and in qualifying I changed a lot of the car to try and change the feeling. "The feeling was getting better until we actually put the medium tyres on and then everything went. It was very difficult when we put on the medium tyres. "For some reason yesterday it felt like the better tyre on our car, but today it felt we could never quite reach the right window of the tyres and made it very tricky."On the race: "There is opportunity but it's going to be tough to come back in the front anyway, but there's opportunity and I will look forward and try to have a great Sunday with a disappointing Saturday."Normally it's been the other way round when I've come here, so I'm looking forward to turning this situation around."

Image source, Getty ImagesMcLaren's Lando Norris will start in P7 tomorrow, he told Sky Sports: "[On the bump on Turn 15] I don't know honestly, I don't have the delta so I don't know how much I lost, two-tenths maybe, so a couple of positions but not 1.1 seconds to Max."I think just a mistake from my side and our side to who had the pit lane first. "There could have been a yellow flag further back and we could have looked like the heroes and everyone else could have looked like losers, now I kind of look like a loser than a hero."It's the price you pay around here and the risk you've got to take. It was still spitting a little bit so I think anyone further back just had more grip."It was a decision that didn't work out in the end, so something we will review and try and do better next time."

He told Sky Sports: "I think I just braked a little bit late, I've not seen any data or anything but it's normally what happens when you end up locking a brake, it's a bit late. "It's disappointing obviously, I thought the car was in a good place. The first two corners were really good but maybe I just tried a little bit too much or the rain has been around, so at some points in that lap it felt a little bit more tricky. "I don't know if that was one of them necessarily, ultimately I need to go and have a look. I think it was a case of trying a little bit too hard."

Image source, Getty ImagesIf you're just joining us, hello! It was a very chaotic qualifying session in Azerbaijan, with six red flags in total and the likes of Charles Leclerc, four-time consecutive polesitter in Baku - and title leader Oscar Piastri crashing out. Lewis Hamilton saw his pole ambitions dashed with a Q2 knockout, while Lando Norris couldn't capatlise on his team-mate's mishap and will start down in seventh place. Max Verstappen will be favourite to convert his pole into another win, but what can Carlos Sainz in P2 and Liam Lawson in P3 do tomorrow? Will we see either one of them keep hold of their podium position?

Image source, Getty ImagesRacing Bullâs Liam Lawson, who starts third on the grid: "Honestly I
canât even remember what happened it was so busy, obviously itâs still raining
now. It was very busy, I said it would be but I didnât expect it to be like
that."The car has been good all weekend and when it needed to be in
qualifying, it was good and so a massive thanks to the guys and girls, the team
has been amazing so far, but obviously tomorrow is the important day."If it was difficult to improve on that last lap: "Itâs always
sketchy because you always see the rain coming on your visor and you can feel
it. "You can kind of see the gloss on the track but because the tyres are so
warm you have grip, so youâre trying to fight your brain and not back off and
keep pushing, itâs definitely tricky."On the race tomorrow: "Itâs going to be a very hard race for
sure, a great starting position, but obviously weâre aware of who we are fighting
around us and that is what we will be focused on."

Image source, Getty ImagesWilliams' Carlos Sainz, who will start on the front row in P2: "Very happy, We've nailed the qualifying today. Every time being on the right tyre at the right time and putting together some very strong laps. "Of course the moment that a top car put a lap together we were always going to be those four or five tenths behind, but it was only one of them, and it was Max - no surprise. For the rest, we managed to beat them. We're in P2, which is great news."I've been putting good laps together this year in qualifying; it hasn't been an issue or my weakness at all. Again we proved that there is speed in this car and delivering in qualifying when it counts. "Unfortunately, the year in races and in points is not going the way we want but as long as the speed is there, like today proves, the good races will come and I'm not worried."On Sunday's race: "I'm going to give it my all to give Williams a first podium. We'll see."

Image source, Getty ImagesRed Bull's Max Verstappen, who starts on pole position in Baku: "A long qualifying to
be honest with so many red flags so it was very difficult to basically get your
lap together. "Most of the time your tyres are not really ready for it or
again a red flag, especially with Q3 with a bit of rain, it was a very
difficult session. "In the final lap you just have to send it, I wasnât even on
the best tyres I wanted but because of the red flags, you basically run out of
tyres. "Iâm very happy so far with how the weekend has gone because
from FP1 we were not too bad and we just kept on improving a tiny amount and
then we were there in qualifying and that is when it matters."On the car: "We definitely were in there for pole, Q3 is
always a bit messy for everyone, but Iâm just happy as since Monza we are doing
a better job and I hope we can continue in that way."On the race: "Itâs a long race, you want to have a good start
but even then we just need to do our own race and look after our tyres."Itâs still quite tough
on our tyres around here because of the softer compounds and then we will see
what happens."

If more than one driver fails to set a time in Q2 or Q3, they will be arranged in the following order.Any driver who attempted to set a qualifying time by starting a flying lap is the first thing, so they all comply with that.The order is then determined in accordance to the order they were classified in the previous period of the relevant qualifying, so the Q2 order if they don't get a time in.
