He is now team principal of Sauber for their transition into Audi's factory team next year.Will Courtenay, head of strategy who had been at Red Bull since it was Jaguar in the early 2000s, resigned in July. He will join McLaren as sporting director as soon as a contractual impasse can be resolved.As Red Bull's form declined through the first half of this season, relations between Horner and the main shareholders worsened.Horner lost the support of the main shareholder, Chalerm Yoovidhya, who saved him when the allegations first became public, and Oliver Mintzlaff, Red Bull's chief executive officer corporate projects and investments, decided to sack him after a poor performance by the team at the British Grand Prix.In a statement on Monday Mintzlaff thanked Horner for his "exceptional work"."With his tireless commitment, experience, expertise and innovative thinking, he has been instrumental in establishing Red Bull Racing as one of the most successful and attractive teams in Formula 1," Mintzlaff said.Horner said in the same statement that leading Red Bull had been "an honour and a privilege".He added: "My biggest satisfaction has been assembling and leading the most amazing group of talented and driven individuals and seeing them flourish as a subsidiary of an energy drinks company and seeing them take on and beat some of the biggest automotive brands in the world."Related topicsFormula 1Top storiesHow best in the world Dembele finally lived up to his potentialPublished4 hours agoWhy Spain's Bonmati won record third women's Ballon d'OrPublished4 hours agoHampton's rise to best keeper in the worldPublished5 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCYour first look at Alan Partridgeâs 'brave' new projectIs it time to copyright your face?The return of a trippy, comic joyrideHow did a duck help solve this 19th-century murder case?Elsewhere in SportHow best in the world Dembele finally lived up to his potentialWhy Spain's Bonmati won record third women's Ballon d'OrHampton's rise to best keeper in the worldHorner, the Â£52m pay-off, and what next for ex-Red Bull boss?How England 2025 boomed into biggest Women's Rugby World Cup everWhy Friday's opening session is likely to shape Ryder CupWhy do West Ham keep conceding from corners?GB fail to win gold for first time in 20 years - where it went wrongMartinelli snatches late draw for Arsenal against Man City.
