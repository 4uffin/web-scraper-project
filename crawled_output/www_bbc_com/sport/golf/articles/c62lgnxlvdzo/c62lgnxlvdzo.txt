But when you start playing under tournament conditions you start seeing a little of those nuances."US Open champion JJ Spaun and Russell Henley are best placed of the remaining eight Ryder Cup players on nine under.Griffin, a captain's pick who will make his debut at the Ryder Cup, said: "I've got to have that chasing mindset as a leader because I know all those guys behind me are going to stay aggressive and I've got to do everything I can to stay in front."Related topicsGolfComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 41Top stories'Difficult to explain' - Juventus 4-4 Dortmund after remarkable second halfAn Arsenal win made from the bench - and inspired by rugby unionPublished5 hours ago'Clean sheet mentality' - pragmatism proving key for TottenhamPublished3 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCRevealing the secrets of our speciesThe photo that exposed a scandalous fake injuryThe gang who stole over Â£50 million from taxpayersIan Wright remembers an inspirational teacherElsewhere in SportWho will win Champions League?
