But when you start playing under tournament conditions you start seeing a little of those nuances."US Open champion JJ Spaun and Russell Henley are best placed of the remaining eight Ryder Cup players on nine under.Griffin, a captain's pick who will make his debut at the Ryder Cup, said: "I've got to have that chasing mindset as a leader because I know all those guys behind me are going to stay aggressive and I've got to do everything I can to stay in front."Related topicsGolfComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 41Top storiesFormer Liverpool manager Beard dies aged 47Published2 hours ago'Norris misses opportunity in chaotic qualifying'Published6 hours ago'He deserves to be in our history' - Fernandes inspires Man UtdPublished3 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCA respectable man leads a vicious 'firm' of thugsThe best and worst foods to eat at sports groundsZara McDermott explores the dark side of ThailandChuck Wepner: The real-life Rocky who floored AliElsewhere in Sport'Incredible' Kildunne adds swagger to party as England reach World Cup final'Silly and naive' - Rooney on Casemiro's poor decision-making
