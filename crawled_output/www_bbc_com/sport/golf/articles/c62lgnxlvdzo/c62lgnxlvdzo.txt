But when you start playing under tournament conditions you start seeing a little of those nuances."US Open champion JJ Spaun and Russell Henley are best placed of the remaining eight Ryder Cup players on nine under.Griffin, a captain's pick who will make his debut at the Ryder Cup, said: "I've got to have that chasing mindset as a leader because I know all those guys behind me are going to stay aggressive and I've got to do everything I can to stay in front."Related topicsGolfComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 41Top storiesGuardiola gamble almost pays off as Liverpool cash inPublished5 hours agoCox leads England to T20 series win over IrelandPublished7 hours agoPiastri 'drops ball' but did Norris miss opportunity?Published6 hours agoloading elsewhere storiesElsewhere in SportGB fail to win gold for first time in 20 years - where it went wrongMartinelli snatches late draw for Arsenal against Man City.
