But when you start playing under tournament conditions you start seeing a little of those nuances."US Open champion JJ Spaun and Russell Henley are best placed of the remaining eight Ryder Cup players on nine under.Griffin, a captain's pick who will make his debut at the Ryder Cup, said: "I've got to have that chasing mindset as a leader because I know all those guys behind me are going to stay aggressive and I've got to do everything I can to stay in front."Related topicsGolfComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 41Top storiesKirk killing increases Ryder Cup risk - New York policePublished1 hour ago'I flew 5,500 miles and paid Â£900 for a Premier League ticket but was turned away'Published9 hours agoArsenal's Madueke out for about six to eight weeksPublished1 hour agoElsewhere on the BBCA respectable man leads a vicious 'firm' of thugsHow did PlayStation games help Rooney at Manchester United?Panorama investigates the desperate shortages of food in GazaKerry James Marshall, painter, shares his cultural influencesElsewhere in Sport'I flew 5,500 miles and paid Â£900 for a Premier League ticket but was turned away'Has modern football adopted the Allardyce playbook?
