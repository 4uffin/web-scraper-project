"If he did well in a tournament, won a tournament, I would text him. We sometimes play practice rounds together, we've had dinners together."In return, Bradley gushed: "There are not many people I like more in the golf world than Luke Donald."I feel lucky to have Luke on the opposite side because we send each other texts, we joke around. I love hanging out and having a drink with Luke Donald."Their thoughts echoed a surreal calm at Bethpage's famed Black Course, with spectators not allowed on to the property until Tuesday.It is then that Europe's players will get a first taste of the New York support, with Donald's dozen set to play all 18 holes of this hilly course on Long Island, about 40 miles east of Manhattan.And they could be âwelcomedâ by thousands of fans in the stand that looms over the first tee and the adjacent 18th green. But will it be as intimidating as the cauldron created by the almost 5,000-seat stand that horseshoed the first tee at Rome in 2023? Donald is taking no chances and has given his players virtual reality headsets which Rory McIlroy explained can be programmed to replicate the "sights and sounds" the away team are expecting. Speaking this month, he said: "You can get them to say whatever you want them to say. You can go as close to the bone as you like."2025 Ryder Cup26-28 SeptemberBethpage Black, New YorkListen on SoundsDaily live text commentary and in-play clips on BBC Sport website from 11:30 BST.

"That was a really fun time. I had this vision of doing that for about a year, and to see how emotional the guys got was a really special time for our team."Bradley ended the debate about whether he would be the US side's first player-captain since Arnold Palmer in 1963, by not selecting himself as a wildcard pick, despite finishing 11th in the qualifying standings.And when asked if he had a tinge of regret about his decision, he replied: "I've thought about it every second."I catch myself every now and then looking down the fairway, seeing the guys and thinking how badly I'd like to do that."But I feel like I've been called for a bigger cause - to help our guys get ready to play at the highest level."Of course, both captains talked of their desire to win this week. That is, after all, what we're here for. Will the US regain the Ryder Cup by extending their winning streak at home to three, or will defending champions Europe win a first away match since 2012?"We haven't come close to winning three out of the past four away Ryder Cups," said Donald. "It's not been close at all. My job is to bridge that gap."Both skippers are also unanimous in their desire for the week to end in harmony, though."Come Sunday night, I can't wait to have a drink with Luke Donald and sit down and try to enjoy this even more," said Bradley.Related topicsGolfRyder CupMore on this storyWhy Friday's opening session is likely to shape Ryder CupPublished3 days agoForty years on, how Jacklin resurrected Ryder CupPublished2 days agoHow does the Ryder Cup work?Published9 SeptemberComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 196Top storiesMcIlroy & Fleetwood reunite in Ryder Cup foursomesPublished5 hours agoAmerica's gladiator - DeChambeau's road to Ryder Cup talismanPublished4 hours agoBarcelona come from behind to beat Cazorla's OviedoElsewhere on the BBCThe gang who stole over Â£50 million from taxpayersDrs Chris and Xand get to the bottom of back painStacey and Joe welcome you back to Pickle CottageMatcha: From centuries-old tradition to global health trendElsewhere in SportWhere Ryder Cup battle will be won and lostThe battles England need to win in World Cup finalMartin feels heat again, but are Rangers players letting him down?
