Image source, Getty ImagesEngland's Tyrrell Hatton after leaping into contention with the best round of the day, an eight-under 64, speaking to Sky Sports: "I am very happy with today's work. It was a bit of a slow start, made a good par save on three, then birdied six. From nine onwards, I gave myself plenty of opportunities. It is nice when the putts go in too!"Clearly, there are opportunities out there and it always gives an exciting finish here. I would love to have another good round and give myself a chance to win.,"It'll be nice to actually talk to my wife and my dad coming off the 18th green rather than on an iPad!"I will try my best - I'm excited by it.

Image source, Getty ImagesFrance's Adrien Saddier speaking to Sky Sports after his seven-under 65 left him as joint leader:"It was a great day. I tried to take advantage of the back nine with the wind helping. There were a lot of good shots, a lot of good putts and a good score at the end."I will just take tomorrow as a normal day - just another day at the office. It's me against me. I will try to hit
al ot of good shots, be in position and see what happens."It would be huge [to win] but I don't want to think about it. There are still 18 holes to play and there are a lot of good players behind me."

Image source, Getty ImagesNorway's Viktor Hovland speaking to Sky Sports after a one-under round of 71:"It wasn't great. "Obviously got off to a really nice start. Looking to keep that momentum going but battling my golf swing and paid the price on the back nine."It's super tricky. If yo're a little bit off, it will penalise you. If you're playing well and make some putts, you can really take it deep. Obviously, the leaders are doing that. If you miss it on the wrong spots, it will punish you."I just have to keep doing what I have been doing. I'm trying to find the fairway however I can. If I do that, I can be somewhat aggressive. "I have got to continue to lean on my putter. I would have liked to really feel confident tee to green so I can give myself a lot of looks on every single hole.

Full highlights of a fascinating round are coming up at 7pm.Until then, we'll give you a bit of reaction to everything that's gone on here at Wentworth.
01Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingBirdie for Hovlandpublished at 18:12 BST 13 September18:12 BST 13 SeptemberHovland -12 (71)
Different result for Viktor Hovland though and he rolls in for a closing birdie. That's his first birdie since the 10th hole.It could have been so much better today but he will go into the final day in the penultimate group, three shots off the lead.Hideki Matsuyama finishes with a birdie too. Not the day the overnight leader would have expected.
22Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingClosing bogey for Rosepublished at 18:11 BST 13 September18:11 BST 13 SeptemberRose -7 (76)
Urgh, poor Justin Rose. It's kissed the side of the hole, rolled round and then rolled out.Ever the gentleman, he touches his cap to the crowd and thanks them but there is a steely glare in his eyes.Four over for the day and that's 10 shots worse than yesterday for the Englishman.
49Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingPostpublished at 18:08 BST 13 September18:08 BST 13 SeptemberMatsuyama -7, Hovland -11, Rose -8 (17)
Nicely done Justin Rose and he's warmly applauded by the punters around the 18th green as he clips over the water and to about eight feet.Now then, Viktor Hovland has eagled this hole twice already this week. Do it again and he's back in business.He'll have to manage it from 34 feet though. Ah it comes up short.
20Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingPostpublished at 18:04 BST 13 September18:04 BST 13 SeptemberMatsuyama -7, Hovland -11, Rose -8 (17)
Doesn't that sum up Saturday for Justin Rose?He takes aim at the 18th but his ball ends up in the water. Bet he can't wait to get home.Viktor Hovland is still in this tournament though and he's got 215 yards with his second shot.Onto the putting surface - and perhaps he can close out in style.
32Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingPar for Ramsaypublished at 17:59 BST 13 September17:59 BST 13 SeptemberRamsay -9 (72)
It's been a lot of fun watching Richie Ramsay and it feels like he has not got his just rewards.That is summed up by his birdie putt staying short at the last and he'll tap in for par.A level-par 72 for the Scot.
12Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingClosing birdie for Abergpublished at 17:57 BST 13 September17:57 BST 13 SeptemberAberg -10 (73)
Ludvig Aberg shot 64 on Thursday and looked imperious.Six back by the end of the round three wasn't part of the plan.He's got an eagle putt on 18 to trim it and he drags it wide but at least will pick up a birdie.Plenty of food for thought for the Swede.
41Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingPostpublished at 17:48 BST 13 September17:48 BST 13 SeptemberMatsuyama -7, Hovland -11, Rose -7 (17)
Over to the 17th where the final group are nearly done.More toil for Hideki Matsuyama who was leading the tournament at the start of this round, but is making another bogey and is now eight shots adrift.Viktor Hovland tidies up for par but it's more mess for Justin Rose who makes his fifth bogey of the round.
34Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingPostpublished at 17:42 BST 13 September17:42 BST 13 September
We have a two-way tie at the top.Be honest, at the start of today who had Adrien Saddier and Alex Noren leading by two at close of play?
61Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingNoren eagles the lastpublished at 17:39 BST 13 September17:39 BST 13 SeptemberNoren -15 (66), Rai -10 (71)
Now then Alex Noren, can you join Adrien Saddier?Eighteen feet for eagle... no bother. Right in the heart of the cup. The Swede has conjured up a birdie-eagle finish and he joins the leader.It's a par for Aaron Rai to finish and he joins Ewen Ferguson at 10 under par.
63Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingFerguson birdies the lastpublished at 17:37 BST 13 September17:37 BST 13 SeptemberFerguson -10 (71)
A fine finish for Scotland's Ewen Ferguson who has stuck around today, a birdie at the last ensuring he cards a one-under 71 to move to 10 under par.

Ludvig Aberg opens his eyes wide at the 17th as he watches his birdie attempt drift past the cup.He was one back going into today - currently he's six behind with one hole to go.
40Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingPostpublished at 17:31 BST 13 September17:31 BST 13 SeptemberNoren -13, Rai -10 (17)
The shadows are lengthening here at Wentworth as Aaron Rai takes aim at the 18th hole.He's miscued it but it's come up safely on the fairway just short of the green. He should be able to set up a chance to finish with a birdie.Playing partner Alex Noren takes aim at the green and he's dialled it in.What a shot - eagle opportunity incoming.

A classic Wentworth day.So much change on the leaderboard and so much that can change in half an hour coming down that final stretch.The volatility of scores down the par-fives to finish. These are crucial holes.
