Structure-wise we are standing really good and we all know what to do, so we're a difficult team to beat."The style of Frank's Tottenham side against Villarreal was in stark contrast to the swashbuckling football played under Postecoglou.They were much more cautious, even after being gifted a fourth-minute opener thanks to a calamitous mistake by Villarreal goalkeeper Luiz Junior.But their defence was excellent, with Van de Ven in particularly halting most of Villarreal's attacks.Even though the visitors had 10 shots, Guglielmo Vicario didn't have a save to make throughout.The price for that level of pragmatism was that Tottenham themselves only had one shot on target - very little for the home fans to get excited about."We defended really well and gave little away throughout the game against a really good Villarreal side," Frank said."I think offensively we didn't hit the highest level. There was definitely a spell second half where we decided let's give it to the Villarreal guys and then we'll sprint back, that's a very good fun thing."It was a very even game that we just edged."Tighter defence but at an attacking cost?Tottenham have conceded just the one goal so far this season - in the 1-0 loss to Bournemouth.That is a big improvement on how they started the previous campaign, when they conceded five in their first five games.In the Premier League they have kept three clean sheets already - meaning they are just two away from equalling their total for the whole of last season.The more solid platform is potentially coming at a cost, however, with their one shot on target against Villarreal the second time in their last three games they had managed so few efforts on goal.Frank knows this is an area that has to improve."We have a very good foundation to stand on in terms of our defensive organisation and I think it's good and we gave little away," he said."This is the Champions League against a good team. Also, I knew we took a step forward against West Ham, offensively is the area we need to get better."Related topicsEuropean FootballTottenham HotspurFootballMore on this storyFollow your club with BBC SportPublished15 AugustListen to the latest Football Daily podcastGet football news sent straight to your phonePublished16 AugustComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 348Top storiesMcIlroy & Fleetwood reunite in Ryder Cup foursomesPublished4 hours agoAmerica's gladiator - DeChambeau's road to Ryder Cup talismanPublished4 hours agoBarcelona come from behind to beat Cazorla's OviedoElsewhere on the BBCThe gang who stole over Â£50 million from taxpayersDrs Chris and Xand get to the bottom of back painStacey and Joe welcome you back to Pickle CottageMatcha: From centuries-old tradition to global health trendElsewhere in SportWhere Ryder Cup battle will be won and lostThe battles England need to win in World Cup finalMartin feels heat again, but are Rangers players letting him down?
