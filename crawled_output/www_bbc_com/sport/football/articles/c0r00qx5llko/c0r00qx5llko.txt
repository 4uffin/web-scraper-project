Rest in peace, Matt."After his reappointment in 2021, Beard led the Reds to promotion back to the WSL and helped them to a seventh-placed finish on their return to the top flight.Beard also managed Liverpool during their first ever Champions League campaign.His brother Mark paid tribute to the "most amazing, caring man who was loved by anyone who had the pleasure to meet him". "We will love you forever Matt Matt," he said in a social media post.The Football Association called Beard a "key figure" in women's football, adding that its "thoughts go out to his family and friends during this difficult time".The WSL posted a tribute on X, saying: "Everyone at WSL Football extends its deepest sympathies to the family, friends and loved ones of Matt Beard following news of his passing."Matt played an instrumental role in the growth of women's football and will be missed by everyone associated with the game."Beard was appointed Burnley manager in June but resigned after just two months in charge.He had previous spells at Millwall Lionesses, Chelsea, West Ham and National Women's Soccer League side Boston Breakers, as well as an interim period in charge of Bristol City.The Clarets paid tribute, saying: "The thoughts and prayers of everyone at the club are with Matt's family and friends."On Sunday, it was confirmed Burnley's Women's National League match against West Brom had been postponed.The Women's Super League posted on X to add that a minute's silence will be held before kick-off in the games taking place in both the WSL and WSL2.Millwall Lionesses, where Beard started his managerial career, said in a statement: "Everybody at the club is deeply saddened by the passing of former Lionesses manager, Matt Beard."We send all our love and support to his family, friends and colleagues across the many clubs he managed at this very difficult time."LMA Chief Executive Richard Bevan said: "Matt was a true champion of women's football and dedicated his early career to advancing the game on its path to professionalisation. "He played an integral role in the development of players, coaches, and the wider game as one of the most active managers in women's football over the past 15 years, achieving success at some of the biggest clubs in the game."'A character who lit up a room'Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Matt Beard was twice named WSL manager of the seasonByEmma SandersBBC Sport womenâs football news reporter'Beardy', as he was known to those in the game, was an ever-present in the WSL and a character that lit up the room. He was funny, loud and straight to the point.He was often likened to 'a giant teddy bear' - a loving man from London who gave out hugs to anyone and everyone in the stands - a contrast to the bellowing manager who shouted instructions to his players from the dugout.Liverpool fans were particularly fond of him as he led the club to back-to-back WSL trophies and returned for a second spell, guiding them back to the top-flight with a Women's Championship title.In the successes, he celebrated hard and happily, enjoying a pint (or two) with staff and supporters in the pub next to Prenton Park, where Liverpool Women used to play their home matches.He invited those of us in the media to join him and discussed further his tactics or what luck was on his side, often teasing us on whether we had been too harsh in the match reports or in our questioning of him in the news conferences.Away from the pitch, he was a family man and always spoke about his children, sometimes joking about how he was struggling to help his son with his maths homework.He told me he wanted to start a podcast where he could discuss "the real issues" in women's football and what it was really like to be a football coach. He found a cheap deal on some recording equipment online and practised.There were ups and downs in his football career but he always cared deeply for his players and the supporters. He will be remembered fondly in the game and the positive impact he had on the people he worked with will remain for a long time.'One of the best humans' - Players and managers pay tributeImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Emma Hayes succeeded Matt Beard as Chelsea manager in 2012A number of figures from the womenâs game have taken to social media to pay their own tribute to Beard.Former Chelsea manager Emma Hayes: "Can't quite compute this. Absolutely one of the best humans. Always available for a chat, one of the good guys. A champion in the women's game and a top bloke. So gutted for his family."Republic of Ireland manager Carla Ward: "Heartbroken."Gilly Flaherty played under Beard at both West Ham and Liverpool: "Absolutely devastated and lost for words at the news of losing Beardy tonight. A man I thought so highly of, who in all honesty I would've followed around the world to play for. The best manager and friend I could've ever had asked to have in my life. Rest easy beardy and give my dad a big squeeze please. Love you gaffer xx."Arsenal and England midfielder Alessia Russo: "Warmest guy with the biggest heart."Former England and Everton forward Toni Duggan: "So very, very sad. RIP Beardy. Sending all my love and a lot of strength to your friends and family. A great man gone far too soon."Olivia Smith was signed by Beard for Liverpool before her Â£1m move to Arsenal: "Wouldn't be where I am without you."Missy Bo Kearns also played under Beard at the Reds: "You believed in me from day one and we got on like a house on fire. All the memories we have I'll never forget especially the one where I lost a bet and you made me train in your kit. I'll be there for the family and the kids always because you made me part of the family. Lots of love Missy Bo 'Headache' xxx."Rachel Daly played under Beard during her loan spell at West Ham: "Absolutely heartbreaking. A truly special man with a heart of gold. RIP Beardy."Related topicsFootballWomen's FootballMore on this storyGet the latest WSL news on our dedicated pageTop storiesMcIlroy & Fleetwood reunite in Ryder Cup foursomesPublished8 hours agoAmerica's gladiator - DeChambeau's road to Ryder Cup talismanPublished7 hours agoBarcelona come from behind to beat Cazorla's OviedoElsewhere on the BBCThe gang who stole over Â£50 million from taxpayersDrs Chris and Xand get to the bottom of back painStacey and Joe welcome you back to Pickle CottageMatcha: From centuries-old tradition to global health trendElsewhere in SportWhere Ryder Cup battle will be won and lostThe battles England need to win in World Cup finalMartin feels heat again, but are Rangers players letting him down?
