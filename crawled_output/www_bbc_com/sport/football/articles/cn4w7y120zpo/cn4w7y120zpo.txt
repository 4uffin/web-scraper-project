Newcastle's keeper barely saw it, let alone had a chance to do something about it.Rashford turned away to accept the acclaim of Barcelona's fans perched high in the Leazes End, the previous taunts of Newcastle's supporters silenced.The cameras cut to Tuchel, who was not moving a facial muscle but who must have surely been smiling inside at two such significant contributions.Superb Rashford sinks Newcastle as Barcelona triumphHowe praises Newcastle 'heart' - but it only takes them so farPublished7 days ago'It's so important he has confidence'Image source, EPAImage caption, Before Thursday, Rashford's most recent Champions League goal came in October 2021 for Manchester United against AtalantaBarcelona coach Flick sounded like a man who knew this was coming: "We always see this from Rashford in training and we saw it here. I'm happy for him."In the offense we have a lot of good players and he's one. I'm happy to have him. He gives us more options to follow the match. It's great to have him."These two goals will help a lot to get Marcus to the next step. It's so important he has the confidence and feels OK. These goals are unbelievable for him for the next steps."Flick's sympathetic approach may be the perfect fit for Rashford, who has been hurt by his recent experiences and will need bringing out of his shell.The manner in which he performed after opening the scoring was that of a player with a weight suddenly lifted off his shoulders.Rashford said: "Playing for Barca is an amazing experience. I've always been a huge admirer of Barcelona. We want to win as much as possible."100% I'm full of excitement. I'm very motivated and determined. The quality we have in the team excites me. It's so refreshing to play with these players."Of course, if Barcelona's 18-year-old genius Lamine Yamal had been fit Rashford may not even have started, but football is about moments and opportunities and he took his spectacularly.The celebrated Robert Lewandowski and Raphinha started alongside Rashford, but it was the latter who was the pick and grabbed the headlines.'Rashford needs an arm around him'To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.This video can not be playedMedia caption, Two goals and three points 'the perfect night' says RashfordRashford is the latest player to be sent on his way from Manchester United and suggest they may have lost something they actually need, the most obvious example being Scott McTominay at Napoli.Another former Old Trafford forward Anthony Elanga, now at Newcastle following a Â£55m move from Nottingham Forest, provided some of the brightest moments for Eddie Howe's side, especially when he set up a first-half chance which Harvey Barnes should have scored.Former United keeper Dean Henderson has won the FA Cup and England honours at Crystal Palace, while even the much-derided striker Rasmus Hojlund made a scoring start at Napoli.Left-back Alvaro Carreras, who was sold to Benfica in January 2024, has just signed for Real Madrid in a deal believed to be worth around Â£50m."Marcus showed what a top, top player he is. We forgot about his talent at Manchester United but he showed he is a real top talent and back to the old Marcus," said former Manchester United midfielder Nicky Butt on Champions League Match of the Day."His work-rate as well, he was very positive in what he was doing. From a young boy he has always threatened a goal and the goal was an amazing header."It was an unbelievable strike [for the second goal] and he has got that in his locker. He is a great striker of the ball and he was the best player."Ruben Amorim will be thinking 'what have I done, I've let that go' when Manchester United are struggling. You need to be loved and he needs an arm around him and when he has that he has shown what he can do."When Rashford was substituted after 82 minutes he was given a deafening standing ovation from the visiting supporters. The acclaim was repeated after the final whistle.Rashford has taken a significant stride on that road to redemption - now can he use the Barcelona stage to finally put his career back on the straight and narrow?Latest Champions League tableChampions League scores & fixturesFollow the latest Champions League newsListen to the latest Football Daily podcastGet football news sent straight to your phonePublished16 AugustWatch highlights of every Champions League game from 22:00 on Wednesday on BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app.There will also be a Champions League Match of the Day on BBC One on Wednesday, from 22:40 to 00:00.Related topicsManchester UnitedUEFA Champions LeagueFootballComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 1180Top storiesMcIlroy & Fleetwood reunite in Ryder Cup foursomesPublished8 hours agoAmerica's gladiator - DeChambeau's road to Ryder Cup talismanPublished7 hours agoBarcelona come from behind to beat Cazorla's OviedoElsewhere on the BBCThe gang who stole over Â£50 million from taxpayersDrs Chris and Xand get to the bottom of back painStacey and Joe welcome you back to Pickle CottageMatcha: From centuries-old tradition to global health trendElsewhere in SportWhere Ryder Cup battle will be won and lostThe battles England need to win in World Cup finalMartin feels heat again, but are Rangers players letting him down?
