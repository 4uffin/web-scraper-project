It's unheard of what he's doing. What an unbelievable player," said Foden.The rapid manner in which the 25-year-old reached his half-century is highlighted by the fact that former Manchester United striker Ruud van Nistelrooy previously held the record at 62 games.Haaland knew what he had achieved, celebrating with a grin on his face and holding up five fingers on one hand and a zero with the other towards the cameras."What can I say? The numbers speak for themselves," said City manager Pep Guardiola. "We are lucky to have him."Just to congratulate him, because he's alongside goalscorers like [Ruud] van Nistelrooy, [Robert] Lewandowski, but especially the two monsters Cristiano [Ronaldo] and [Lionel] Messi for 20 years, for Erling to be there is unbelievable."Haaland scores 50th CL goal in victory over NapoliCan Haaland beat Ronaldo's record?Haaland is swatting aside whatever competition is being put in front of him.He took his tally to 90 goals in 101 Premier League games during Sunday's victory over Manchester United, four days after netting an astonishing five goals in Norway's 11-1 hammering of Moldova.In Europe's elite club competition, Haaland reached his half-century on Thursday night having scored 27 times for City, 15 for Borussia Dortmund and eight for RB Salzburg.The bulk of those (34) have come from his trusted left foot, with 11 from his right and a further five with his head, including the effort against Napoli.Former City goalkeeper Joe Hart said on TNT: "He looked dangerous, it is such a clever ball, to not break stride - it is the instinct of a pure goalscorer."He looks fit, strong and hungry and I am really excited to see what he can achieve this season. You can have a near perfect game as a defender but as soon as you slip [he scores]."To underline how fast he has achieved the feat, Lionel Messi needed 66 matches to reach 50 goals in the competition, while Cristiano Ronaldo lagged way back by requiring 91.The Portuguese forward, though, is the top scorer with a 141 Champions League goals.Asked if Haaland can one day surpass Ronaldo's mark, Guardiola said: "In that rhythm, yeah. He's not injured, he could play for 10 or 12 more years, and he maintains this progression, absolutely."Ex-City defender Joleon Lescott added: "He may not be the one who is having a great game, but if he is given a chance in front of goal he has a level of composure to execute."Related topicsManchester CityUEFA Champions LeagueFootballComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 613Top storiesEurope 'fuelled by something money canât buy' - DonaldPublished2 hours agoWhy 'Wood has to watch his back' as Igor Jesus shines Published2 hours agoRodgers' 'realism' hints at Celtic's new normal in Europa LeaguePublished2 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCThe life of Gordon Welchman, a WW2 codebreaking heroThe best and worst foods to eat at sports groundsThe life and career of the iconic 1960s model, TwiggyLooking at the political language that defined recent monthsElsewhere in Sport'A cool scene' - but will Bethpage's first tee intimidate Europe?Chasing greatness through grief - England's warrior queenLamine Yamal - the eve of a new football era'Bird became cricket legend without scoring a run for England'Who are the players in England's Ashes squad?Why NFL Dublin opens 'new chapter' for Irish sportHow will each side fare in Prem Rugby?
