They conceded 12 in 2010-11 and were relegated.The Hammers' three defeats in the Premier League this season have all been by a 3+ goal margin (0-3 v Sunderland, 1-5 v Chelsea, 0-3 v Spurs). The fourth round of fixtures is the joint earliest a side has lost three games by a 3+ goal margin in a season in the competition, level with Bournemouth in 2022-23.Potter has the second-worst win percentage in the Premier League of any West Ham manager with 27.3%.West Ham have lost their opening two home Premier League games for the third time in the past four seasons (also 2022-23 and 2024-25). It is the eighth time they have done, three more than any other side.Since Potter's appointment on 9 January, West Ham have the worst Premier League record of the 17 ever-present Premier League teams in that time.What's the problem at West Ham?To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.This video can not be playedMedia caption, Spurs 'serious' top four contenders - Ashley WilliamsWest Ham made five signings in the summer, with highly rated full-back El Hadji Malick Diouf, goalkeeper Mads Hermansen and former Newcastle striker Callum Wilson among those to arrive.Despite bolstering his defensive options that has been the main concern for West Ham this season.Aside from the alarming number of goals they have conceded, it is also the type they are letting in.No team has conceded more headed goals (five) than West Ham this season, while they have also let in six goals from corners - only two fewer than they conceded from corners in the whole of last season (eight)."We conceded nine or 10 set-pieces before the goal [against Tottenham] and defended them well," said Potter."We made a mistake at the far post and got punished."But for ex-Newcastle goalkeeper Shay Given, it is not just about the poor start to the season but more the poor form that has been going on longer."Everyone said judge Graham Potter when he's had a full pre-season and a chance to get his own players in, but there's been no improvement," he told BBC Sport.Seeing the stadium half empty in the second half, just like it was against Chelsea, will worry the West Ham hierarchy. "Tomas Soucek's red card didn't help but that is six wins and 11 defeats in 22 league matches for Potter. They've started so poorly. Will he be given more time? I'm not sure."Patience needed or time for change?Image source, AFP via Getty ImagesImage caption, West Ham have lost three of their four Premier League games this seasonBBC Sport's chief football news reporter Simon Stone:Even when they are being subjected to the kind of criticism they are getting at the moment, West Ham's ownership tend not to go in for knee-jerk reactions when it comes to dealing with managers.Chairman David Sullivan is more likely to give someone a game or two extra rather than act when there is still a possibility the situation might be pulled round.Clearly though, heavy home defeats by two of the club's fiercest rivals and slipping into the bottom three is not a good look, especially when Potter's appointment last season failed to trigger the improvement hoped for.If there is a slight positive as far as Potter is concerned, it comes from knowing we are still incredibly early into the new season. Julen Lopetegui collected only five points from his first six Premier League games in charge last season and it was January before he was sacked. In 2022-23, West Ham collected five points from seven games with David Moyes in charge.The secondary point is that West Ham made four signings between 29 August and the transfer deadline closing two days later. Given there was an international break in between, how much time has Potter had to work with his new-look squad?Next week, unbeaten Crystal Palace visit London Stadium for a game where huge demonstrations against the ownership are planned. If that game doesn't go well, a tense atmosphere could turn toxic.After that it's a trip to Merseyside and a meeting with Moyes' improving Everton before a trip to Arsenal, where West Ham have won on their past two visits, including under Potter in February.That feels a more obvious time to reassess, even if many West Ham fans feel getting rid of the manager is only the start of the change they really want.'Manager isn't the issue' - what the fans thinkBonny: Graham Potter? At this rate, even Harry Potter would struggle to work his magic. This has relegation written all over it.Matt: 11 goals (and counting) conceded in four games is relegation waiting to happen. For all the owners need to leave for West Ham to be a success, the inability to defend so far this season has to sit with Graham Potter.Andy: West Ham were poor under Moyes, poor under Lopetegui and poor under Potter. The manager isn't the issue. Moyes is doing well at Everton because they give him a wage budget and back him with transfers. West Ham do neither, for any manager.Martin: As a lifelong Hammer and a multi-decade season-ticket holder this club is losing its soul. I fear the manager will pay the price but the truth is the blame for a total lack of strategy and the destruction of that soul lies with the owners.
