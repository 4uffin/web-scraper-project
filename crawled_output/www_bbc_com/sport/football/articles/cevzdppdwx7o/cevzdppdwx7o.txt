There was an image towards the end of the game where I saw the Manchester United fans leaving."You could hear the fans singing Amorim's name, but I think that is so powerful that the United fans were leaving the game. "You know the game is over and I think they were very disappointed in what they were seeing. It is hard to see how it continues."What are the patterns? What are we seeing what might improve the team moving forward?"United finished 15th in the league
last term with 42 points, their lowest position since 1989â90. They earned their fewest points in a top-flight season since they were last relegated in 1973â74.Since Amorim's arrival they have spent about Â£250m on new signings, while shipping out most of their so-called 'bomb squad'.This has allowed the 40-year-old coach to revamp his side into a 3-4-3 system that he has vowed not to deviate from after enjoying success with Sporting.However, many of last season's problems already appear to be resurfacing."I think after the last year when Ten Hag got sacked and Ruben came in, we're hearing how they're going to play and it is going to change," said Rooney, who scored 253 goals for United between 2004 and 2017."I think if the manager is honest with himself, it has got worse."Watch the Wayne Rooney Show on BBC Sport YouTube , externaland iPlayer.

They're getting overrun and overpowered in that midfield."Listen, I have had my time as a manager, and I know how it works, and I know how it is when someone else looks and critiques your formation. I can understand that, but it is so obvious."If you're struggling, you have to put three in midfield and give yourself a chance to compete."Related topicsManchester UnitedFootballMore on this storyLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan viewsAsk about Man Utd - what do you want to know?Top storiesEurope 'fuelled by something money canât buy' - DonaldPublished2 hours agoWhy 'Wood has to watch his back' as Igor Jesus shines Published1 hour agoRodgers' 'realism' hints at Celtic's new normal in Europa LeaguePublished1 hour agoElsewhere on the BBCThe life of Gordon Welchman, a WW2 codebreaking heroThe best and worst foods to eat at sports groundsThe life and career of the iconic 1960s model, TwiggyLooking at the political language that defined recent monthsElsewhere in Sport'A cool scene' - but will Bethpage's first tee intimidate Europe?Chasing greatness through grief - England's warrior queenLamine Yamal - the eve of a new football era'Bird became cricket legend without scoring a run for England'Who are the players in England's Ashes squad?Why NFL Dublin opens 'new chapter' for Irish sportHow will each side fare in Prem Rugby?
