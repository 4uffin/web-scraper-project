What coach says no to Benfica? Not me," Mourinho told reporters after landing in Lisbon."When I was presented with the opportunity to coach Benfica, I didn't hesitate to say that I'm interested, that I'd like to."In a statement to Portugal's financial regulator, external the CMVM on Thursday, Benfica confirmed "negotiations are under way" with Mourinho and they expect them to be "concluded soon".Mourinho began his managerial career with Benfica in 2000 but took charge of only 11 games and left after a dispute with the club president.He then made his name with Porto between 2002 and 2004, winning six trophies - including the Champions League in 2003-04.Since leaving his homeland in 2004, Mourinho has managed Chelsea, Inter Milan, Real Madrid, Manchester United, Tottenham Hotspur, Roma and Fenerbahce.He left the Turkish club on 29 August, two days after they were eliminated from the Champions League play-offs by Benfica.Should Benfica appoint Mourinho, he would face Chelsea in the Champions League at Stamford Bridge on 30 September.Benfica also travel to Newcastle United and host Real Madrid later in the league phase of the competition.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Jose Mourinho has won league titles in four different countriesRelated topicsEuropean FootballFootballMore on this storyListen to the latest Football Daily podcastTop storiesEurope 'fuelled by something money canât buy' - DonaldPublished2 hours agoWhy 'Wood has to watch his back' as Igor Jesus shines Published2 hours agoRodgers' 'realism' hints at Celtic's new normal in Europa LeaguePublished1 hour agoElsewhere on the BBCThe life of Gordon Welchman, a WW2 codebreaking heroThe best and worst foods to eat at sports groundsThe life and career of the iconic 1960s model, TwiggyLooking at the political language that defined recent monthsElsewhere in Sport'A cool scene' - but will Bethpage's first tee intimidate Europe?Chasing greatness through grief - England's warrior queenLamine Yamal - the eve of a new football era'Bird became cricket legend without scoring a run for England'Who are the players in England's Ashes squad?Why NFL Dublin opens 'new chapter' for Irish sportHow will each side fare in Prem Rugby?
