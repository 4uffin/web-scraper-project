What coach says no to Benfica? Not me," Mourinho told reporters after landing in Lisbon."When I was presented with the opportunity to coach Benfica, I didn't hesitate to say that I'm interested, that I'd like to."In a statement to Portugal's financial regulator, external the CMVM on Thursday, Benfica confirmed "negotiations are under way" with Mourinho and they expect them to be "concluded soon".Mourinho began his managerial career with Benfica in 2000 but took charge of only 11 games and left after a dispute with the club president.He then made his name with Porto between 2002 and 2004, winning six trophies - including the Champions League in 2003-04.Since leaving his homeland in 2004, Mourinho has managed Chelsea, Inter Milan, Real Madrid, Manchester United, Tottenham Hotspur, Roma and Fenerbahce.He left the Turkish club on 29 August, two days after they were eliminated from the Champions League play-offs by Benfica.Should Benfica appoint Mourinho, he would face Chelsea in the Champions League at Stamford Bridge on 30 September.Benfica also travel to Newcastle United and host Real Madrid later in the league phase of the competition.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Jose Mourinho has won league titles in four different countriesRelated topicsEuropean FootballFootballMore on this storyListen to the latest Football Daily podcastAttributionSoundsTop storiesGuardiola gamble almost pays off as Liverpool cash inPublished5 hours agoCox leads England to T20 series win over IrelandPublished8 hours agoPiastri 'drops ball' but did Norris miss opportunity?Published7 hours agoloading elsewhere storiesElsewhere in SportGB fail to win gold for first time in 20 years - where it went wrongMartinelli snatches late draw for Arsenal against Man City.
