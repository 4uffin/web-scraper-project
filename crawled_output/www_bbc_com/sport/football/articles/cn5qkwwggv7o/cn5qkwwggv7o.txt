No coach has been appointed, nor has any coach been mentioned to represent Benfica in the future."Qarabag create history in stunning win at BenficaWatch: Jose Mourinho - how to win the Champions LeagueHow rejection fuelled Mourinho's second Champions League triumphPublished23 AprilMourinho began his managerial career with Benfica in 2000 but took charge of only 10 games and left after a dispute with the club president.He then made his name with Porto between 2002 and 2004, winning six trophies - including the Champions League in 2003-04.Since leaving his homeland in 2004, Mourinho has managed Chelsea, Inter Milan, Real Madrid, Manchester United, Tottenham Hotspur, Roma and Fenerbahce.Should Benfica appoint Mourinho, he would face Chelsea in the Champions League at Stamford Bridge on 30 September. Benfica also travel to Newcastle United and host Real Madrid later in the league phase of the competition.Benfica are sixth in the Primeira Liga, five points adrift of leaders Porto, but have a game in hand.They finished second in the top flight last season - two points behind Sporting - under former Wolves boss Lage.The move to part company with Lage coincides with Benfica preparing for their presidential election on 25 October.Joao Noronha Lopes, favourite to win the election, has his sights set on Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim and was at Etihad Stadium on Sunday to watch Portuguese.Costa said the decision to make a managerial change is not motivated by his attempt to get re-elected."I'm not here to save any positions," Costa said. "I haven't even gone anywhere to campaign yet, because my goal, as president of Benfica, is to ensure the best future for Benfica, regardless of what happens in the elections. "And this decision-making has to do solely and exclusively with Benfica's sporting season, and to avoid jeopardising Benfica's sporting season. I've never put my interests ahead of Benfica's, and I'm not going to do so now."Related topicsFootballMore on this storyFollow your club with BBC SportPublished15 AugustListen to the latest Football Daily podcastGet football news sent straight to your phonePublished16 AugustTop storiesHow best in the world Dembele finally lived up to his potentialPublished4 hours agoWhy Spain's Bonmati won record third women's Ballon d'OrPublished3 hours agoHampton's rise to best keeper in the worldPublished4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCYour first look at Alan Partridgeâs 'brave' new projectIs it time to copyright your face?The return of a trippy, comic joyrideHow did a duck help solve this 19th-century murder case?Elsewhere in SportHow best in the world Dembele finally lived up to his potentialWhy Spain's Bonmati won record third women's Ballon d'OrHampton's rise to best keeper in the worldHorner, the Â£52m pay-off, and what next for ex-Red Bull boss?How England 2025 boomed into biggest Women's Rugby World Cup everWhy Friday's opening session is likely to shape Ryder CupWhy do West Ham keep conceding from corners?GB fail to win gold for first time in 20 years - where it went wrongMartinelli snatches late draw for Arsenal against Man City.
