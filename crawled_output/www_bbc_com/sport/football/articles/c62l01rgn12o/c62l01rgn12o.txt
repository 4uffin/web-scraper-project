"He felt something at the beginning of the match and tried to carry on but it was too sore, so let's see."Asked to confirm whether Madueke will be out for weeks rather than months, Arteta replied: "We hope so. Like I said, we need to scan him again to see the extent of the injury but it doesn't look too bad."Arsenal face Port Vale in the third round of the Carabao Cup on Wednesday. Earlier, sources indicated medics were waiting for the swelling to subside before making a definitive diagnosis on the injury, but it is understood that Madueke will be sidelined for a minimum of six weeks, though that timescale is thought to be the best-case scenario.The news is a major blow to Arteta and England head coach Thomas Tuchel given Madueke's promising start to the season.If the initial prognosis is confirmed, Madueke will not return to action until November at the earliest, ruling him out of a clutch of key domestic and European games for the Gunners.The attacker is set to miss England's forthcoming games against Wales and Latvia, while also making him a doubt for World Cup qualifiers against Serbia and Albania in mid-November.Arsenal face Sunderland on 8 November in the Premier League. If Madueke is unavailable for that game and the international break, he could return for the north London derby versus Tottenham on 23 November.No 'handbrake tactics' for Arsenal Arteta was criticised after the home draw with City for his cautious tactics, as summer signing Eberechi Eze dropped to the bench, despite Martin Odegaard's absence, and Martin Zubimendi, Declan Rice and Mikel Merino formed a midfield three.Sky Sports pundit Jamie Carragher highlighted the similarities between the Spaniard and former Liverpool managers Gerard Houllier and Rafa Benitez, who he played under, saying Arsenal can sometimes have the same "handbrake on" mentality as the ex-Reds bosses. "I don't read it but if you tell me that this is the main [narrative], I'm surprised - I would be extremely surprised with my knowledge and my know-how and how I analyse a football game," Arteta responded. "Because it was impossible for somebody to predict such a dominance from Arsenal throughout 96 minutes, because it never happened in 17 years of Pep [Guardiola] as a manager."So if the narrative goes somewhere else and we're talking about dominance, how can you be dominant against such a team if you have, what was the word? Handbrake?"Dominance and handbrake, they are two different words. But I accept everything. I will learn more to have a different vision."Related topicsPremier LeagueArsenalFootballMore on this storyLatest Arsenal news, analysis and fan viewsAsk about Arsenal - what do you want to know?Comments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 596Top storiesEurope 'fuelled by something money canât buy' - DonaldPublished2 hours agoWhy 'Wood has to watch his back' as Igor Jesus shines Published2 hours agoRodgers' 'realism' hints at Celtic's new normal in Europa LeaguePublished2 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCThe life of Gordon Welchman, a WW2 codebreaking heroThe best and worst foods to eat at sports groundsThe life and career of the iconic 1960s model, TwiggyLooking at the political language that defined recent monthsElsewhere in Sport'A cool scene' - but will Bethpage's first tee intimidate Europe?Chasing greatness through grief - England's warrior queenLamine Yamal - the eve of a new football era'Bird became cricket legend without scoring a run for England'Who are the players in England's Ashes squad?Why NFL Dublin opens 'new chapter' for Irish sportHow will each side fare in Prem Rugby?
