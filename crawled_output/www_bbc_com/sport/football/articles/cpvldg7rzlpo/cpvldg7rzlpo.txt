Why is Saliba so important to Arsenal?ByTom McCoyBBC Sport journalistSaliba's centre-back partnership with Gabriel has developed into one of the most formidable in the Premier League. His ability on the ball and reading of the game makes him the perfect foil for the more physically dominant Brazilian.Saliba has won possession more often than any Arsenal player in the Premier League since his debut in 2022, but he also plays a crucial role in build-up play. He has completed more passes than any of his team-mates over the past three years and is second only to Martin Odegaard when it comes to carrying the ball forward.The 24-year-old also ranks second in terms of clearances and aerial duels won, with those metrics both led by Gabriel.Saliba was sorely missed during the during the final two months of the 2022-23 season, with Arsenal's title chances disappearing while he recovered from a back issue, but he has sat out only four top-flight matches since.The summer signings of Cristhian Mosquera and Piero Hincapie mean the Gunners are now well stocked in central defence, but securing Saliba's long-term future is nonetheless a crucial bit of business.Related topicsPremier LeagueArsenalFootballMore on this storyLatest Arsenal news, analysis and fan viewsAsk about Arsenal - what do you want to know?Comments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 220Top storiesMcIlroy & Fleetwood reunite in Ryder Cup foursomesPublished7 hours agoAmerica's gladiator - DeChambeau's road to Ryder Cup talismanPublished7 hours agoBarcelona come from behind to beat Cazorla's OviedoElsewhere on the BBCThe gang who stole over Â£50 million from taxpayersDrs Chris and Xand get to the bottom of back painStacey and Joe welcome you back to Pickle CottageMatcha: From centuries-old tradition to global health trendElsewhere in SportWhere Ryder Cup battle will be won and lostThe battles England need to win in World Cup finalMartin feels heat again, but are Rangers players letting him down?
