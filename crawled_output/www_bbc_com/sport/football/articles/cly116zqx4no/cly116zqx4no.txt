"When he gets on the ball, he is a danger and he has been so impressive in his short time at Liverpool."Ekitike's goal - Liverpool's second, neatly driven under Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford - eventually settled a derby where nerves were jangling in the closing minutes, as David Moyes' improving Toffees posed a real threat.To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.This video can not be playedMedia caption, Liverpool 'intelligent' in exploiting Everton - Murphy analysisLiverpool's late-goal specialists did not need to strike this time, but the fear around Anfield was Everton would issue that last-gasp blow as the pressure grew.In the end all was well: five wins from five, this last one secured despite starting with Isak and Florian Wirtz - Â£241m worth of summer signings - on the bench.And, sounding a note that is ominous for those hoping to challenge Liverpool for the title, once again this was not a performance sprinkled with the sparkle of champions.Liverpool are getting the job done without being at their best, which begs the question - what will they be like when all the new parts accrued this summer fit?Image source, EPAImage caption, Hugo Ekitike acknowledges the acclaim of Liverpool's fans after the Merseyside derby win against Everton at AnfieldIsak once again, understandably, looked rusty in his appearance as a substitute while Wirtz, who has shown real signs of finally settling to his task in recent games, still has so much more to produce on past evidence."They can play together, of course they can. They're both exceptional players," former Liverpool midfielder Danny Murphy said about Ekitike and Isak."But the manager sees them both as number nines - I think they will split games. One plays 60 minutes, the other 30."I think in certain games he might play Ekitike on the left or as a number 10 but predominantly I see them both as central strikers."Ekitike settled instantly, from the moment he scored an early goal against Crystal Palace in the Community Shield at Wembley, delivering performances that have seen Anfield take him to its heart.Slot was delighted to keep Liverpool's winning run going after a tough Champions League assignment at home to Atletico Madrid on Wednesday, telling BBC Sport's Match Of The Day: "I'm very satisfied taking everything into account that we had to play our third game in seven games, having the early kick-off. "I don't care at all about the early kick-off but I do care if you have to play on Wednesday night, then you have to manage this through the whole week."Taking that all into account and winning the derby with a great first-half performance, it is good."Slot added: "Our mentality kept us in the game because they didn't have another chance after their 2-1 goal. We have showed great mentality and showed great quality when we were fresh in the first half."Ekitike can take great praise for his contribution in building the platform for another win for relentless Liverpool.To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.This video can not be playedMedia caption, Moyes criticises referee after derby defeatRelated topicsLiverpoolPremier LeagueFootballMore on this storyLatest Liverpool news, analysis and fan viewsAsk about Liverpool - what do you want to know?Comments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 698Top storiesFormer Liverpool manager Beard dies aged 47Published2 hours ago'Norris misses opportunity in chaotic qualifying'Published7 hours ago'He deserves to be in our history' - Fernandes inspires Man UtdPublished4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCA respectable man leads a vicious 'firm' of thugsThe best and worst foods to eat at sports groundsZara McDermott explores the dark side of ThailandChuck Wepner: The real-life Rocky who floored AliElsewhere in Sport'Incredible' Kildunne adds swagger to party as England reach World Cup final'Silly and naive' - Rooney on Casemiro's poor decision-making
