"Two more came on, the Heskey brothers. I think their father and mother will be so proud of their kids. That's really cool."Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Reigan Heskey joined City's academy at the age of eight'Brothers with similar attributes' Reigan, the younger of the siblings at 17, is described as a "tricky, clinical winger" on City's website, while Jaden, two years older, is seen as a "mature, hard-working" box-to-box midfielder.The pair have been regulars in City's academy sides, with both brothers joining the youth set-up at the age of eight.Jaden, who regularly captains City's U21 side, scored as City beat Leeds 4-0 to lift the FA Youth Cup in 2024. Despite playing in different positions, father Emile says the pair have similar qualities. "They're similar to me," Heskey told the Mail, external in August. "They are both very athletic."The young one is very quick. The older one is a bit of a beast like I was."They've both got similar attributes."Against Huddersfield, Jaden got 14 minutes, replacing fellow academy graduate Nico O'Reilly, with Reigan coming on for Savinho shortly after.The pair attracted interest from a number of clubs in England from a young age but City were seen as the best for their development."I've been lucky in a sense that they're arguably one of the best, if not the best academy [City] to be at for development," Emile said in 2024."So you just leave them and let them enjoy that journey. "And then obviously getting into first-team football, well, under-21s football and then first-team football, it's a little bit different and they'll probably need a bit of guidance then."Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Jaden, the older of the siblings, helped City to the FA Youth Cup in 2024Who is Emile Heskey?After joining Leicester City's academy at the age of nine, the forward made his first-team debut at the age of 17 in a Premier League match against Queens Park Rangers in 1995.It was in the following season, after Leicester's relegation, that Heskey became a regular with his boyhood club, scoring seven goals in 35 appearances. The striker helped the Foxes back into the Premier League, before tasting League Cup success under Martin O'Neil in 1997 and 2000.Standing 6ft 2in and powerfully built, as a centre-forward Heksey was a target man whose ability to hold the ball up and bring others into play made him a great partner for the likes of former England striker Michael Owen.Heskey made his England debut in 1999, before earning a club record Â£11m move to Liverpool in 2000.Heskey scored 22 goals in 56 appearances during his first full season at Anfield, as the Reds won the Europa League, FA Cup and League Cup.He spent five years at Liverpool before joining Birmingham City, where Heskey scored 16 goals in 78 appearances.Spells at Wigan and Aston Villa followed, before Heskey spent two years with Australian side the Newcastle Jets.He finished his career with two seasons at Bolton Wanderers in the Championship.Heskey scored seven goals in 62 appearances for England, and appeared at two World Cups for the Three Lions.

Chelsea striker Liam Delap is the son of former Stoke City defender Rory, while former Arsenal striker Ian Wright is the father of Manchester City pair Shaun Wright-Phillips and Bradley Wright-Phillips.
