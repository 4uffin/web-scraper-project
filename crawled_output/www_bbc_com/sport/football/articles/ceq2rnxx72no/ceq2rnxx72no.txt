It's been 47 years since they failed to win any of their opening five league fixtures.You then chuck in a humiliating exit in the Champions League play-off to Club Brugge.The question now, after so much turmoil on and off the park since the former Southampton manager took charge in June, is whether he can turn this around or whether he will be given the opportunity to do so.Ibrox turns toxic after another nightmare unfoldsIt was clear at Ibrox that if things didn't go Rangers' way, there was a strong chance the support would be quick to turn, with Martin the focus of their ire.It unfolded exactly like that. Boos were deafening at times and "sacked in the morning" was sung by some home supporters.Many simply left, it was all too much to bear. The build-up had been dominated by his decision to continue to omit Belgium midfielder Nicolas Raskin despite claiming an issue with the player had been "resolved". That issue seems far down the pecking order right now.To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.This video can not be playedMedia caption, 'How long can this go on?' - Boos ring around Ibrox"Only results will convince them," Martin told BBC Scotland afterwards."My job is to convince the players and the staff inside the building after a difficult afternoon and give them enough support and detail to improve."It is not going to be an easy journey for me to win favour. It hasn't been from day one with a lot of people, but we'll keep working and make sure it does."Professionally, it hurts a bit because nobody sees how hard you work. "No-one sees the stuff you have to deal with, but it is what it is and is the job of a football manager."Victorious Hearts manager Derek McInnes felt compelled to explain how unfair he felt Martin's treatment had been during the match. That perhaps shines a light on how toxic this became.Former Rangers winger Neil McCann was part of Barry Ferguson's interim coaching team last season, and has doubts whether Martin can survive this latest setback."I'm not sure," he said. "I really felt for him and he looked really uncomfortable at the end of the game. "I know he's not one for walking away but when the fans show their disdain and their displeasure like that then it's really difficult to come through it."He would have to go on an enormous run to turn that fanbase because they demand better."Case for the defence?Martin has only been in charge for just over three months. It is so early in his tenure and the level of change Rangers required was, and has been, drastic. Most observers would recognise that might take time to embed, but time is one thing you don't get at Rangers. Not anymore, at least, after sustained underachievement.Martin clearly believes the squad is now there to challenge for the title, but the horse may have already bolted in terms of taking on Celtic, or maybe Hearts given their current nine-point advantage over the Ibrox side.

"The Rangers fans have had enough," said Billy Dodds, who was also an assistant to Ferguson last season."They needed to get results to dampen it all today and they've not done that."It's not nice when things don't go well at Ibrox. Four draws and a defeat, you're going to come under pressure."Fan views: 'Martin could get Rangers relegated' We asked for Rangers fans to share their thoughts after another dismal outing:Here's a selction of their views:Paul: This game may well be Russell Martin's last. This cannot go on any more, if there are Rangers fans still in the stands by the end of this debacle I will be surprised. The fans will vote with their feet in their droves. Martin isn't cut out for this, we need someone who knows what they're doing and we need it now!Brian: Russell Martin could get us relegated. He's the only person on Earth who thinks this is acceptable.Brian: Martin is deluded, heard him say before the game, "we are in a good place at the moment". What? After a draw at home with an awful Celtic team? Sack him, he is an embarrassment!Lee: Martin surely has to go. If you don't have the players to play the way you want you have to adapt. He isn't being a manager he's being a dictator. You can't force players to play in a way that they clearly can't.Alex: How many chances does Russell Martin need to get? It is clearly obvious he is out of his depth and cannot manage. It was doubtful before he got the position and now it is firmly confirmed that he is the wrong person for the job.Jackie: I think Martin needs to be given more time. Can't just keep changing manager after a run of bad results. At some point we have to stick to someone and see it through to the bitter end.Baz: I said it after the first game of the season how worried I was about Russell Martin's appointment and how long a season it's going to be. Sadly, I've been proven correct and if he isn't sacked tonight or tomorrow, the crowds will start dropping and the players confidence will get even lower if that's possible.Garry: Martin's tactics are the definition of insanity - doing the same thing repeatedly and expecting different results. No wins, no progress, and no prospect of being the manager by Christmas.Related topicsScottish PremiershipRangersScottish FootballFootballMore on this storyVisit our Rangers page for all the latest news, analysis and fan viewsGet Rangers news notifications in the BBC Sport appPublished18 June 2023Top storiesEurope 'fuelled by something money canât buy' - DonaldPublished2 hours agoWhy 'Wood has to watch his back' as Igor Jesus shines Published1 hour agoRodgers' 'realism' hints at Celtic's new normal in Europa LeaguePublished1 hour agoElsewhere on the BBCThe life of Gordon Welchman, a WW2 codebreaking heroThe best and worst foods to eat at sports groundsThe life and career of the iconic 1960s model, TwiggyLooking at the political language that defined recent monthsElsewhere in Scottish sport'Aberdeen savour the most perfect game ever played'How McTominay became a Napoli icon after Man Utd exitScotland men's internationals to be shown live on BBCCommonwealth Games: Why is it so special to be part of Team Scotland?From titles to tinpottery - rank Scotland's top 10 clubsElsewhere in Sport'A cool scene' - but will Bethpage's first tee intimidate Europe?Chasing greatness through grief - England's warrior queenLamine Yamal - the eve of a new football era'Bird became cricket legend without scoring a run for England'Who are the players in England's Ashes squad?Why NFL Dublin opens 'new chapter' for Irish sportHow will each side fare in Prem Rugby?
