"No one. Not even the Pope will change..."This is my job. This is my responsibility. This is my life. So, I will not change that."Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim is yet to win successive Premier League games with the clubAmorim's reasoning for sticking with his system remains the same.He feels if he bows to pressure it will undermine him in the eyes of his players."If I'm a player and I have a coach that, with a lot of pressure and [people] all around the world, are saying 'you need to change the system', says 'I'm going to change', they will look at me in a different way."Everything is important when you think about the impact that a decision is going to have on the team."I'm doing things my way. I hope to have the time to change but it will be an evolution."Speaking before Chelsea's visit to Old Trafford, Amorim says he understands the urgent need to win games.While United officials have rejected the idea he has the three games until next month's international break to save his job, Amorim knows the matches against Chelsea, Brentford and newly-promoted Sunderland have the potential to change the narrative around him.The return from injury of Â£62.5m forward Matheus Cunha is likely to see skipper Bruno Fernandes again start in a deeper midfield role against Chelsea.Fernandes' failure to track Phil Foden's run into the United penalty area in the lead-up to the opening goal against City - following a similar error that allowed Emile Smith Rowe to equalise for Fulham at Craven Cottage last month - has been cited as evidence for why the 31-year-old should be moved higher up the pitch.Not for the first time, Amorim explained why he feels Fernandes can be more effective in the centre of his midfield."I want Bruno to have more possession to try to control the game," he said."Maybe he doesn't have the same freedom to get inside the box but he is getting there and he can do his shots."Sometimes we miss Bruno in front a little bit but if Cunha is there we have an extra player."I'm just trying to balance the team and imagine the game and I see Bruno well."He's frustrated because he is not winning and sometimes he likes to go further. But he has a job to do."Meanwhile, director of football Jason Wilcox has given a rare interview in which he has discussed the "challenges" he has encountered at the club since he joined in April 2024.Speaking at the Association of Former Manchester United Players on Thursday night in a Q&A shared by Man Utd The Religion Youtube channel, the 54-year-old said he "thought the club was in a much better place than it was" and "the whole structure of Manchester United needed to change"."I pray we get the opportunity to turn it around. I really feel it is not 'will we win again?' but 'when we'll win again'," he added.Related topicsManchester UnitedFootballMore on this storyLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan viewsAsk about Man Utd - what do you want to know?Comments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 2221Top storiesFormer Liverpool manager Beard dies aged 47Published2 hours ago'Norris misses opportunity in chaotic qualifying'Published6 hours ago'He deserves to be in our history' - Fernandes inspires Man UtdPublished3 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCA respectable man leads a vicious 'firm' of thugsThe best and worst foods to eat at sports groundsZara McDermott explores the dark side of ThailandChuck Wepner: The real-life Rocky who floored AliElsewhere in Sport'Incredible' Kildunne adds swagger to party as England reach World Cup final'Silly and naive' - Rooney on Casemiro's poor decision-making
