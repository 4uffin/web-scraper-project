Isak is set to make his first appearance for the Reds in their Champions League opener against Atletico Madrid at Anfield on Wednesday.At his pre-match news conference Slot pointed out that Liverpool's unprecedented spending was offset by more than Â£250m recouped in sales, having spent just Â£10m the previous summer."There is so much focus on our new signings, especially from pundits that favour some other clubs in the country that cannot stop talking about Â£450m," Slot said. "I repeat, Â£450m, Â£450m! But they forget about [nearly] Â£300m that we have sold [players] for. So, yes, if we want to strengthen the squad we need to spend that much money."Who will win Champions League?

"I think it is only a compliment that people tell everyone we have spent so much because that tells you the players we brought in are seen as very good players," explained the Dutchman."Some other teams prefer to bring in 27-year-olds because they are ready, but we think we have brought in players who are 21, 22 [and] who are ready."I think all the money we have spent we generated ourselves by selling, and by winning the league after we didn't buy anyone at all."Isak did not feature in Liverpool's 1-0 win at Burnley on Sunday - the first match since he joined the Reds - because he is still short of match fitness.The 25-year-old trained alone at former club Newcastle, in a bid to force through his switch to Anfield, and needs extra work to get up to speed after missing pre-season.Isak's only appearance this season came for Sweden in an 18-minute cameo from the bench in a 2-0 defeat by Kosovo last week.Slot said he is "100% sure" Isak will not play 90 minutes against Atletico but indicated he will play a part against the La Liga side."He [Isak] is part of the squad, so it's already a Champions League game to look forward to, but if people look forward to his playing time, that could mean that could happen tomorrow as well," Slot added."So the moment he is fit, match fit, [he] can play 90, and then the next step is playing three times in a week 90 minutes."And that is what he has to do; scoring goals and doing special things in attack is something he will 100% do. The main challenge he has is to become so fit that he's first of all ready to do what he did last season."Related topicsLiverpoolPremier LeagueUEFA Champions LeagueFootballMore on this storyLatest Liverpool news, analysis and fan viewsAsk about Liverpool - what do you want to know?Comments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 977Top storiesGuardiola gamble almost pays off as Liverpool cash inPublished5 hours agoCox leads England to T20 series win over IrelandPublished8 hours agoPiastri 'drops ball' but did Norris miss opportunity?Published6 hours agoloading elsewhere storiesElsewhere in SportGB fail to win gold for first time in 20 years - where it went wrongMartinelli snatches late draw for Arsenal against Man City.
