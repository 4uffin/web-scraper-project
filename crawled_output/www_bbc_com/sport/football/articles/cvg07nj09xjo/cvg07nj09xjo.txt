And done it in "Arne Time".Salah scores stoppage-time penalty as Liverpool inch to win at Burnley The Reds have four Premier League wins out of four, all secured by late â some very, very late â goals.Liverpool scored in the 88th minute, then in the fourth minute of stoppage time, to beat Bournemouth 4-2 in their opening game at Anfield, after they had conceded a 2-0 lead. Teenager Rio Ngumoha bagged a 100th-minute winner at Newcastle United, again after Liverpool had been two up.Dominik Szoboszlai's decisive free-kick against Arsenal came seven minutes from time â and Salah followed suit with only seconds left at Burnley.As far as Slot's Liverpool is concerned, this is a new phenomenon.Liverpool have already scored more 90th+ minute goals this season (3) than last term, with both in 2024-25 coming in the same game against Brentford in January, when Darwin Nunez struck twice.In this recent run, Liverpool have become the first side in Premier League history to win four consecutive games with winning goals scored in the final 10 minutes or later.The goal also extended Liverpool's club record run to 38 top-flight games in which they have scored - the last time they failed to find the net was a year ago on Sunday.They will aim to equal Tottenham's run of 39 matches next weekend when they face Everton at Anfield, with Arsenal holding the record on 55 games.Image source, PA MediaImage caption, Burnley manager Scott Parker was devastated after Liverpool's stoppage-time penalty condemns his side to defeatWith this comes a psychological impact that adds to Liverpool's wide range of weapons.As in the prime "Fergie Time" days, there is now an audible groan from opposing fans when the board goes up for added time when Liverpool are seeking a winner.It happened when "11" went up with the score 2-2 at St James' Park. It was the same at Burnley when "5" flashed up beneath The Bob Lord Stand.It all adds to the opposition's anxiety and Liverpool's power.As the game ticks towards its conclusion, Liverpool are now inside opponents' heads, striking fear that a late goal is coming. This result was so cruel on Burnley, but no-one is safe, no points are taken against Liverpool, until the final whistle has sounded.In their own dramatic way, Liverpool are actually carrying out Slot's instructions from last season.He said in January: "One of the things I would like us to do better in the second half of the season than the first half, although it wasn't necessary that many times, is to make a late goal winner."Hopefully we don't come to these situations a lot but we definitely, if we are coming in those situations, have one, two or three times a moment where we do score in the last minute of the game when we deserve it."Slot said after those demands had been satisfied once more at Turf Moor: "Compliments to Burnley for the way they defended. It was difficult for us to find an opening and a few times we were close."If we had scored, the game may have been open, but because we didn't they did the same thing. We had to wait until the end phase of the second half and in the final stages we got what were hoping for."There is a chance it will fall in the way you want, but it was difficult because they had players behind the ball. We needed a moment of luck, or a moment of magic. "We didn't have the magic but we had the luck. You are hoping and trying to make it more difficult, but they were strong."The fact Liverpool have needed late goals in their first four Premier League wins illustrates that they have not yet been near their best this season â a frightening prospect for those hoping to take their crown off them, and with Â£125m striker Alexander Isak waiting in the wings.Slot kept Isak back at Burnley, believing he was better employed working on his match fitness ahead of Wednesday's Champions League opener against Atletico Madrid at Anfield.It also, more significantly, shows the steel that runs through this Liverpool side. Strength of character to accompany the skill. A winning mentality attuned to the old adage of another managerial great, Brian Clough's "it only takes a second to score a goal".Liverpool have not quite been winning ugly, but it has not been pretty. Ominous signs for their challengers.In the usual hostile Turf Moor atmosphere, Burnley mounted fierce resistance and were superbly organised to frustrate Liverpool.The last time Scott Parker managed against Liverpool, it ended in a 9-0 thrashing for Bournemouth at Anfield in August 2022, a humiliation that resulted in his sacking days later.Here, Parker was 30 seconds from redemption as he set Burnley up superbly, with Liverpool restricted by keeper Martin Dubraka's saves from Szoboszlai and Frimpong, while a free header was directed wide by Federico Chiesa when the defensive stranglehold was loosened for once.It was all to no avail. "Arne Time" was still to come.Related topicsLiverpoolPremier LeagueFootballMore on this storyLatest Liverpool news, analysis and fan viewsAsk about Liverpool - what do you want to know?Top storiesWho will win Champions League?
