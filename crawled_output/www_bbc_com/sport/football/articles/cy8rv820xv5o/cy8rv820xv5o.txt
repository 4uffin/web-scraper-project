"The emotion got the better of me. My apologies to all the Red family. Thanks to the fans who always support us and to my team-mates for this victory!"But, speaking just after the game, his manager Arne Slot was left bemused."It is not [stupid] because it was his second [yellow] - it's stupid even if you haven't had a yellow card yet," he said. "Maybe I'm a bit old-fashioned but I did score a few goals - not at his level, but I did - and if I went past three players and put it in the top corner then maybe you can say: 'This is all about me.'"But if I scored a goal like he did tonight, I would turn to Chiesa and say: 'It's about you Federico - great assist, great run and I didn't have to do a lot.' Maybe that's me being old-school. "It was stupid, not smart in every sense. The good thing is that his team-mates helped him to get the win over the line, but the thing is he is now suspended for Saturday and that is far from ideal."How costly could it be for Ekitike?To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.This video can not be playedMedia caption, Slot on Ekitike sending-offLiverpool signed Ekitike for Â£69m in July from Eintracht Frankfurt and he has started the season in excellent form.Leading the line while the Reds completed the deal for Isak then took their time working the Sweden forward up to full fitness, he has scored three goals in five Premier League games and provided one assist. That has helped Liverpool win every game they have played since their Community Shield defeat by Crystal Palace on 10 August, and underlines his importance to the team, regardless of his unnecessary dismissal on Tuesday.Indeed, both cards he picked up were needless. Replacing Isak for the start of the second half, he was booked soon after when he threw the ball in the air after being penalised for a foul.Former Premier League striker Chris Sutton said on BBC Radio 5 Live that Ekitike had shown "sheer stupidity" to be sent off for taking his shirt off.He added: "He's been such an important player for Liverpool so far this season - what a start to his Liverpool career, important goal [against Southampton] - but that's not great for Arne Slot if he's sitting out the game at the weekend."The main thing Ekitike is likely to take from this is an important learning experience."I'd be very surprised if he does it again," added Slot."He probably forgot he got a yellow. He's young and he will learn from it. I'm sure he won't do it again."Is Isak ready to start against Palace?Isak has had his playing time carefully managed since joining Liverpool. His two starts have been in cup competitions - playing 58 minutes against Atletico Madrid in the Champions League on 17 September and then this first-half appearance against Southampton.In the Premier League he has made just one appearance - coming off the bench in the 67th minute in the 2-1 win against Everton at the weekend.Isak's half-time departure against the Saints was most probably because Slot had one eye on the weekend as well, so may have already been planning to give him more game time at Crystal Palace.As well as scoring against Southampton, he also had a big chance early on but fired straight at goalkeeper Alex McCarthy."I feel good," Isak told ITV. "With every game I play it is very helpful and gets me in better shape."On if he feels ready to start, he added: "It is difficult to say. It is a mixture of fitness-wise and football-wise. "I feel good and feel I am in a shape to make a difference."Related topicsLiverpoolFootballEFL CupMore on this storyFollow your club with BBC SportPublished15 AugustListen to the latest Football Daily podcastGet football news sent straight to your phonePublished16 AugustComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 1670Top storiesMcIlroy & Fleetwood reunite in Ryder Cup foursomesPublished5 hours agoAmerica's gladiator - DeChambeau's road to Ryder Cup talismanPublished4 hours agoBarcelona come from behind to beat Cazorla's OviedoElsewhere on the BBCThe gang who stole over Â£50 million from taxpayersDrs Chris and Xand get to the bottom of back painStacey and Joe welcome you back to Pickle CottageMatcha: From centuries-old tradition to global health trendElsewhere in SportWhere Ryder Cup battle will be won and lostThe battles England need to win in World Cup finalMartin feels heat again, but are Rangers players letting him down?
