It's clear we are in a position where we do not have the right to react and it is not good when we react."However, Simeone was unhappy at what he called "insults for the whole game" from the home fans.He added: "We [managers] are in a position where we are protagonists/standard bearers, so in the same manner that we fight against racism and insults in stadiums today, we could also fight on behalf of the managers, against the insults we receive throughout the whole game."It's not easy to be in the position we are in and receive insults for the whole game. I saw it from far away after the third goal. I saw the third goal go in and I turned, the insults continued, and well, I'm a person."When pressed on what the nature of the insults were, he responded: "The truth is I cannot remember exactly. I don't want to enter into the situation. "The thing I have is that I have to maintain my position. I need to know how to withstand everything that happens in front of the dugout, and know I cannot fix society. I, and whichever manager, has to live with this because it happens all of the time."My reaction isn't justifiable but do you know what it is like to be insulted for 90 minutes? I hope Liverpool can improve that aspect and that when they identify the person who did that, there will be consequences."The incident came at the end of a frantic match as Liverpool scored twice inside the opening six minutes through Andy Robertson and Mohamed Salah, before the Spanish side fought back.Marcos Llorente scored twice for Atletico to level the tie, but the reigning Premier League champions and current leaders rallied to snatch the decisive third goal through Van Dijk's powerful header.To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.This video can not be playedMedia caption, Van Dijk header snatches victory for Liverpool against AtleticoRelated topicsLiverpoolEuropean FootballUEFA Champions LeagueFootballAtlÃ©tico MadridMore on this storyListen to the latest Football Daily podcastTop storiesWhy 'Wood has to watch his back' as Igor Jesus shines Published42 minutes agoCeltic held by Red Star in Europa League return'A cool scene' - but will Bethpage's first tee intimidate Europe?Published4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCThe life of Gordon Welchman, a WW2 codebreaking heroThe best and worst foods to eat at sports groundsThe life and career of the iconic 1960s model, TwiggyLooking at the political language that defined recent monthsElsewhere in Sport'A cool scene' - but will Bethpage's first tee intimidate Europe?Chasing greatness through grief - England's warrior queenLamine Yamal - the eve of a new football era'Bird became cricket legend without scoring a run for England'Who are the players in England's Ashes squad?Why NFL Dublin opens 'new chapter' for Irish sportHow will each side fare in Prem Rugby?
