It's clear we are in a position where we do not have the right to react and it is not good when we react."However, Simeone was unhappy at what he called "insults for the whole game" from the home fans.He added: "We [managers] are in a position where we are protagonists/standard bearers, so in the same manner that we fight against racism and insults in stadiums today, we could also fight on behalf of the managers, against the insults we receive throughout the whole game."It's not easy to be in the position we are in and receive insults for the whole game. I saw it from far away after the third goal. I saw the third goal go in and I turned, the insults continued, and well, I'm a person."When pressed on what the nature of the insults were, he responded: "The truth is I cannot remember exactly. I don't want to enter into the situation. "The thing I have is that I have to maintain my position. I need to know how to withstand everything that happens in front of the dugout, and know I cannot fix society. I, and whichever manager, has to live with this because it happens all of the time."My reaction isn't justifiable but do you know what it is like to be insulted for 90 minutes? I hope Liverpool can improve that aspect and that when they identify the person who did that, there will be consequences."The incident came at the end of a frantic match as Liverpool scored twice inside the opening six minutes through Andy Robertson and Mohamed Salah, before the Spanish side fought back.Marcos Llorente scored twice for Atletico to level the tie, but the reigning Premier League champions and current leaders rallied to snatch the decisive third goal through Van Dijk's powerful header.To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.This video can not be playedMedia caption, Van Dijk header snatches victory for Liverpool against AtleticoRelated topicsLiverpoolEuropean FootballUEFA Champions LeagueFootballAtlÃ©tico MadridMore on this storyListen to the latest Football Daily podcastTop storiesFormer Liverpool manager Beard dies aged 47Published2 hours ago'Norris misses opportunity in chaotic qualifying'Published6 hours ago'He deserves to be in our history' - Fernandes inspires Man UtdPublished3 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCA respectable man leads a vicious 'firm' of thugsThe best and worst foods to eat at sports groundsZara McDermott explores the dark side of ThailandChuck Wepner: The real-life Rocky who floored AliElsewhere in Sport'Incredible' Kildunne adds swagger to party as England reach World Cup final'Silly and naive' - Rooney on Casemiro's poor decision-making
