Marco Silva was also asked about Harry Wilson's future at the club, with the Wales international's current contract due to expire at the end of the season: "I know him very well. I know how much we wants to stay at the football club. If we can get an agreement, his future is going to be with us - 100% sure. The links with other clubs, it's normal."Image source, Getty Images

Marco Silva was asked about the process of easing in new players -
Bayern Munich loanee Jonah Kusi-Asare and AC Milan loan signing Samuel Chukwueze - into his team. "Naturally, they are going to get minutes throughout the season, because we signed them." Silva said."[Kusi-Asare] is a young lad, he needs time to adapt. He came from a massive club, let's see when he's ready to have minutes. It will take time."

Chelsea's EFL Cup opponents Lincoln City are third in League One having lost just one of their opening nine league games. They reached the third round of the EFL Cup with a hard-fought 1-0 win at fellow third-tier side Burton Albion and go into the match on the back of consecutive league victories. Blues boss Enzo Maresca, no doubt chastened by Manchester United's damaging defeat at League Two Grimsby Town in the previous round, admits to being wary about Tuesday's tie. "These are the games that worry me most, because you can slip up very easily," he said. "Football is full of these kind of games and I am very worried about that."

Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca was unable to give much clarity on star forward Cole Palmer's ongoing injury issues.It is clear that these are problems the club is managing, but when you have to take off Palmer at Old Trafford while a goal down, after just 21 minutes, then it is becoming a problem.You could sense from the Italian's press conference that there is broader concern about injuries, not only on the seven who are out on either a short-term or long-term basis, but also how it impacts those who are playing.Chelsea will likely give some academy players a chance against League One Lincoln City, but will also not be able to rest certain first team players given they have seven injuries and rank second in the Premier League injury table.Benoit Badiashile and Romeo Lavia are not quite ready to return.

Image source, Getty ImagesChelsea manager Enzo Maresca dismissed rumours that Cole Palmer needs surgery on his groin injury...for now at least."The medical staff, they didn't mention to me about surgery," he told media at a news conference to preview Tuesday's third-round EFL Cup tie at League One Lincoln. "I don't know if in the next days or the next weeks, but I don't think so, to be honest."Maresca added that Palmer, who missed two games at the start of the season because of the injury, had come through a fitness test before Saturday's Premier League defeat at Old Trafford."He made a huge effort on Saturday to try to play the game," said the Chelsea boss. "He did the test, he was OK but not 100%. But he wanted to be there to help his team-mates and to be there in that kind of game. "Unfortunately, it was painful so we decided to change it. And it's more day-by-day, week-by-week, game-by-game to see how it is and then decide what we do."

Chelsea forward Cole Palmer is unlikely to feature in Tuesday's EFL Cup third-round tie at League One Lincoln after being forced off in the first half of Saturday's 2-1 defeat at Manchester United.Manager Enzo Maresca said that the club's medical staff are monitoring a recurring groin problem that has restricted Palmer to just two starts this season.He was withdrawn before last month's win at West Ham and missed the Blues' victory over Fulham before returning as a second-half substitute at Brentford on 13 September. Palmer scored against the Bees in a 2-2 draw and was on the scoresheet again in a 3-1 Champions League defeat at Bayern Munich. But a third game in eight days proved a stretch too far for the 23-year-old England forward, who limped off after just 21 minutes at Old Trafford.Image source, Getty Images

They [the board] have got to give the fans something to cheer about because the players are not doing that. But I would always say: 'Be careful what you wish for.'The fans did not want David Moyes there, but I bet they would have him back in a heartbeat now.They [the board] thought Julen Lopetegui would bring attractive football, but they cannot have watched him because his teams just play counter-attacking football and defend. So I question who is bringing in these managers.They have also brought in all of these players and spent loads of money but they are not good enough.Graham Potter has got his work cut out. Everyone knows he is under massive pressure.It looks like there is no going back for Potter and Nuno Espirito Santo is probably the one person you look at and think: 'Can he go in there and change it?'He would have to work with the same players but he is defensively strong because we saw what he did at Nottingham Forest.

I daren't even check the texts because I already know someone is correcting my inability to read.More people are actually voting that they would give Graham Potter MORE TIME. Not that they want him out. Sorry Graham. It's my sixth shift in a row I am a tired man and I cannot see.And also Frank, this time last year, Spurs were 10th, not second!It's all gone Pete Tong.

West Hamâs defeat by Crystal Palace on Saturday was their
third home London derby loss in their five Premier League matches this season.Graham Potter won his first home game in charge of West Ham,
which was a 3-2 league win over Fulham in January but has since overseen just
one more: a 2-0 victory back in February over a Leicester side in freefall
under Ruud van Nistelrooy.Palaceâs 2-1 win on Saturday, which followed a 2-0 league
win at the London Stadium in January, means the Eagles have won as many matches
at West Hamâs home ground as the Hammers themselves in 2025.

This time last year Spurs were 2nd. Look how that turned outâ¦.
Premier League campaign is a marathon not a sprint. Try backing the team throughout the season rather than calling for sackings in September! Worlds mad enough as it is letâs not add to it.Frank, Sussex

No pleasing some of you folk is there! If you could choose anyone *realistically* to be your next manager at West Ham, who would it be?Fun fact though, the completely 100% accurate thumb poll is a lot closer than I imagined.
A few more opting for out rather than in but it's definitely much nearer to a 50-50 split than I envisioned!

Image source, Getty ImagesIt takes time to then get players out, get players in - and then before you know it, that manager doesn't get the results and then they're gone and you're back to square one.The club having a good foundation would help.Brentford and Brighton have a clear way of playing. Regardless of which manager they bring in, they stick to that and that's why you've seen progression from those clubs.

Potterâs decision making & selections does not help his cause one bit. The job is difficult enough without the ego war going on behind him between Sullivan & Brady. Regardless who the manager is Brady & Sullivan need to sell up before they destroy the club.Andy, RomfordSome managers and clubs click (Iraola at Bournemouth, and, ironically, Potter when at Brighton) and sometimes it doesn't click (maybe Potter now). West Ham will likely spin the wheel of fortune again, they may get lucky, they may not, but it's also plain to see that the issue goes wider.Mark, BournemouthI donât think the board will give him a lot longer. I like the man and his results at Brighton proved it. The problem is deeper - badly run club well run club.Barry, Leigh-on-Sea
