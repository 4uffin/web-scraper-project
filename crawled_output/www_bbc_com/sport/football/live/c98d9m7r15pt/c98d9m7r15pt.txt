Image source, Getty Images[Chelsea] has not been in the Champions League for a few years now. They are a very young side who are still growing. There is a gigantic difference between the Conference League and the Champions League. Bayern Munich are there every year and theyâre usually competitive every year as well. The game being at the Allianz is going to be a big ask for Chelsea coming here.For me, if they get a draw I think thatâs a brilliant results for Chelsea because if you look at most teams who come to this ground they do struggle because of the pressure thatâs put on them and the expectation of Bayern.They should be fearless. There's no reason why they should fear anyone at all. They've beaten a lot of good teams. Do they look to me like they have the strength of one, two, three or four other teams in this competition? No, they don't, not yet. They certainly don't have the experience but now and again youth can surprise you. I think they'll do quite well in this competition. I just wouldn't be putting any pressure on them to get to quarter-finals or even the semi-finals. If they got there it's all well and good but I think that's for next year or even the year after that.

Without Alvarez, Atletico will surely struggle tonight given their early season struggles with him - I suspect their game-plan will mirror Burnley's, ie park the bus and look to counter - an early Liverpool goal might just open the floodgates (hopefully) despite Slot's cautious and respectful pre-match words.Keith, Southampton

Image source, Getty ImagesChelsea and Bayern Munich have met in the Champions League five times. The Blues got the better of Bayern to reach the semi-finals in 2004-05 and then lost to Liverpool who went on to win the competition. It was of course against Bayern Munich, on their home turf too, when Chelsea won the Champions League for the first time back in 2012. The last couple of meetings between the two sides will also live long in the memory but for all the wrong reasons if you're a Chelsea fan. They were dumped out of the Champions League by Bayern after losing 7-1 on aggregate.

It's obviously difficult. The club's done lots of change. I wouldn't necessarily say it's a bad thing."If you look at last season, we qualified for this competition and we went on to achieve two trophies. We started with all the change. We started pretty slow. But last season, we've come on."

Nicolas Jackson,
who left Chelsea in slightly
acrimonious circumstances on transfer deadline day, could make his
Champions League debut for Bayern Munich tonight â against his parent club.The Premier
League does not allow loan player to feature against the team that owns them but
that is not the case in Europe. Uefa rules state clubs cannot apply âany
influence whatsoever over the players that another club may (or may not) field
in a matchâ.The same
situation arose last season when Marco Asensio, then on loan at Aston Villa
from Paris St-Germain, lined up against the Parisians. More infamously, Philippe
Coutinho scored twice as Bayern Munich thrashed Barca in 2020 whilst on loan
from the Catalan club, the Brazilian sheepishly raising his hands in apology
after netting the final goal in an 8-2 win.Premier
League rules were altered to stop such scenarios after Lomana LuaLua scored a
late equaliser for Portsmouth against parent club Newcastle in 2004, with the
Magpies having reportedly forgotten to include a contractual clause to prevent
him from facing them. However,
there is no blanket ban on loan players turning out against their employers in
many other major leagues such as the Bundesliga, La Liga, Serie A or Ligue 1.
