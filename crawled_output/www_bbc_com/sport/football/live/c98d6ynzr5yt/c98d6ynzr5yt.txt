Jack Grealish has been outstanding at Everton. Noni Madueke has started well at Arsenal so his injury is a blow, while Tijjani Reijnders has shown good early signs at Manchester City.

Image source, Getty ImagesJohn: Does Pep Guardiola over-think tactics e.g. against Arsenal or Inter Milan? Would he have been better off sticking with the Keegan philosophy of " we'll score more than you"?Hi John, I think he has done in the past â the Champions League final defeat to Chelsea was the classic example â but I think he was simply pragmatic against Arsenal.Iâm never sure âweâll score more than youâ ever works as a strategy and Iâm not sure Guardiola ever employed that approach.

Image source, Getty ImagesAlex: Question For Phil With none of the bottom three currently one of the promoted clubs do you think it's strange that only West Ham appear to be willing to change their manager and when do you envisage the panic button being pressed?Hello, Alex. So we are talking Aston Villa, Wolves and West Ham United.I donât see the panic button being pressed at all at Villa unless something absolutely catastrophic and unexpected happens. Unai Emery is a superb manager with an outstanding record and they will trust him to get it right.Vitor Pereira clearly has the faith of the Wolves hierarchy as they have just given him a new contract â although we all know what happens if teams keep losing games. It is then when faith is truly tested.This leaves Graham Potter at West Ham United. The feeling there is he is in real trouble but the Hammersâ plight is not just down to him. You have to look at poor managerial appointments and poor signings.

Image source, Getty ImagesMichael: Hello Phil! I am wondering what would the barometer of success be for Mikel Arteta this season, other than winning the Premier League or Champions League. Winning the FA or League Cup? Finishing second with no trophies? How would you feel about this if you were an Arsenal fan?Afternoon, Michael. Simple answer from me. Mikel Arteta has to win a trophy this season, preferably the Champions League or the Premier League. Any tangible success would be welcome after five years without silverware â but really weâre talking about the biggest prizes.If Arsenal finish second without a trophy, that is failure in my opinion.

They have been over the course and distance successfully on so many occasions and still have plenty of players who know what it takes to win the Premier League.Will they win it? My tip before the start of the season was Liverpool and I have seen nothing to change my mind.

Image source, Getty ImagesLuisa: Can Tottenham aspire to a top three place in the league?Hi Luisa. I think they should aspire to it, but I think more realistically they are top six contenders â although manager Thomas Frank will surely have his sights on the top four and another season in the Champions League next term.We have to remember the context here. Spurs finished 17th last season and lost 22 games, so it is quite a leap to the top three.

Image source, Getty ImagesSean: Hi Phil, What are your thoughts on Liverpool after six games in all competitions and do you think Florian Wirtz and Liverpool will improve to be a cohesive team moving forward? Paul Merson said on Saturday that Liverpool can't keep relying on late goals. Thoughts please? Thank you.Hello, Sean. Well I agree teams cannot rely on late goals forever and it was a bit of a freakish run â but they did win, which is the object of the exercise.I think it is very ominous that Liverpool have not been at their best and yet they have won every game. I also think in the last two or three games Florian Wirtz has shown real signs of bedding in and having a better understanding with those around him.Even the best teams and players need time to adapt when so many new faces come in, so I am sure Liverpool will improve, which is not good news for those other clubs hoping to win the Premier League.

Image source, Getty ImagesNoni Madueke is expected to miss the next couple of months for Arsenal through injury so the attacker will have to wait a while to register his first goal and assist for the club. Having played in five of the six matches for the Gunners so far this campaign, the stats aren't so kind in that sense, with the 23-year-old putting up just 0.09 for expected goals per 90 and 0.25 for expected assists. However the former Chelsea man has excited fans with his outings, even receiving a standing ovation from his supporters in their 3-0 victory over Nottingham Forest.

Back to that news on Noni Madueke missing up to eight weeks with a knee injury. The Arsenal and England winger is not expected to return to action until November at the earliest, ruling him out of a clutch of key domestic and European games for the Gunners.He is set to miss England's forthcoming games against Wales and Latvia, while also making him a doubt for World Cup qualifiers against Serbia and Albania in mid-November.Arsenal face Sunderland on 8 November in the Premier League. If Madueke is unavailable for that game and the international break, he could return for the north London derby - against Tottenham - on 23 November.

Newcastle United manager Eddie Howe said the "EFL Cup is a competition that we love so we are desperate to do well again."
He explained that the team he picked against Bournemouth was a "very strong team" and he thought they performed strongly albeit without scoring a goal. He said the players who featured against the Cherries may have a rest, but he still wants to progress in the competition so there has to be a balance.
Newly signed Yoane Wissa has been told he does not need surgery on the knee injury he picked up on international duty. Howe says the forward should return after the international break.
Howe added that the early rounds of the EFL Cup are "so important" and pointed to some of the tough fixtures the side have faced in recent years.
Finally, the 47-year-old claimed comparisons between new signing Nick Woltemade and former striker Alexander Isak were not
"favourable" and said the team needed to create more chances for the German forward to score.

Frank wouldn't put a timeframe on a return for Dejan Kulusevski but said hopefully he is "not too far away"
He said he and his team will "do everything" to try and win the Carabao Cup for Spurs
