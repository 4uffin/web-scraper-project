However, Juan Carlos Carcedo's side held firm despite the hosts ramping up the pressure during the second half.While Olympiacos monopolised possession and territory, that did not translate into a glut of clear-cut opportunities to score.Having already defeated established names like Maccabi Tel-Aviv, Dynamo Kyiv and Red Star Belgrade to reach this stage, Pafos delivered a fine rearguard action.It took a stinging long-range effort from captain Panagiotis Retsos, palmed to safety by visiting goalkeeper Neofytos Michael, for the home side to register a shot on target after 68 minutes.Michael was also called into action to deny Retsos from the resulting corner. Olympiacos' Mehdi Taremi came close to levelling the playing field when he was initially shown a straight red card for a tackle on Jaja during a Pafos counter-attack, but a VAR review downgraded it to a yellow.And it was only during the final 10 minutes that the visitors' eight-match unbeaten run away from home looked in danger, with the Iran forward having one effort blocked and miscuing another wide.The Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.

They won five of their 10 games in the tournament (D2 L3), and were eliminated in the last 16 by Swedish side DjurgÃ¥rden (3-1 on aggregate).JosÃ© Luis Mendilibar has managed two games in the UEFA Champions League previously, drawing both with Sevilla in the 2023/24 group stage, against Lens and PSV. Heâll be the third Spaniard to manage Olympiakos in the competition, along with Ernesto Valverde and MÃ­chel.Since the start of the 2023-24 season, the player with the most goals scored in major European competition is Olympiakos forward Ayoub El Kaabi (21 goals in 23 appearances). In this period, he has netted 10 goals in 14 games in the UEFA Europa League and 11 goals in nine outings in the Conference League.Mislav Orsic has averaged a goal every other game in his UEFA Champions League career, scoring six goals in 12 appearances (all for former club Dinamo Zagreb).Olympiakos forward Mehdi Taremi averaged the most high-intensity pressures per 90 of any player in the UEFA Champions League last season (76 â min. 500 minutes played). Indeed, he was one of only two players to make 100+ in a league phase match last term (102 v Manchester City), along with JuliÃ¡n Alvarez (108 v Bayer Leverkusen).Mislav Orsic is one of only 10 players in UEFA Champions League history (since 1992-93) to score a hat-trick on his debut in the competition. Indeed, since he did so for Dinamo Zagreb in September 2019 (v Atalanta), only one other player has managed to do so (Ajaxâs SÃ©bastien Haller v Sporting CP in September 2021).Â Live TextPostat 90 minutes plus 790'+7Match ends, Olympiakos 0, Pafos 0.Full Timeat 90 minutes plus 790'+7Second Half ends, Olympiakos 0, Pafos 0.Postat 90 minutes plus 590'+5Chiquinho (Olympiakos) wins a free kick in the attacking half.Postat 90 minutes plus 590'+5Foul by Anderson Silva (Pafos).Postat 90 minutes plus 490'+4Attempt missed.
