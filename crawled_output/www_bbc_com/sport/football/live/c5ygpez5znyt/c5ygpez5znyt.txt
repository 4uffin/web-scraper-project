on aggregate by eventual winners Newcastle. With good strength in depth following their summer strengthening, they will fancy their chances of at least replicating that run to the last four this term.They had a different look this match, with Arteta making nine changes from Sunday's 1-1 draw with Manchester City.That perhaps played a part in their struggles to get a second goal after Eze's early opener, and for all their dominance of the ball, they did not create too many chances before substitute Trossard ensured there would be no late drama.Eze will be delighted to get off the mark after returning to the club, but Mikel Arteta believes the Â£60m signing has more to give."He played very centrally against a team that's super compact inside. It's not easy to find spaces, but he's very capable with the ball," Arteta said."He needs to still to play a little more time with those guys to understand the timings, especially the things that he needs to do and then actions like that will be more consistent and better for us."In general, very good - there is still a lot more to give, I think."It was not a memorable display from Arsenal but they got the job done - with the additional positive of Bukayo Saka managing more than 60 minutes as he works back to full fitness after hamstring problems.What next for these clubs?Arsenal return to Premier League action on Sunday, 28 September (16:30 BST) when they travel to Newcastle while Port Vale are at Barnsley in League One on Saturday, 27 September (15:00 BST).Have your say on Arsenalâs performanceThe Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.
