This time it was captain Van Dijk who was the hero with a towering header in front of The Kop deep into stoppage time.It was the cue for more wild celebrations.Slot will have his concerns that Liverpool struggle to hold on to an advantage, but the sheer force of will made this another late, late show at Anfield.Gravenberch Liverpool's unsung heroOn a night when Isak and another chaotic Liverpool victory might claim top billing, the star turn was a magnificent display from midfield man Gravenberch.The 23-year-old Netherlands international was a key figure in the 'number six' role as Liverpool won the Premier League at a canter last season and, after missing the opener against Bournemouth at Anfield through suspension, his performances have hit an even higher level this term.Gravenberch was outstanding in the win at Burnley on Sunday, but was even better against Atletico with a Rolls-Royce display in midfield, marked by some unstoppable surging runs through midfield, crisp tackling and wide range of passing.The spotlight may shine on others at Liverpool, but no-one will underestimate the stellar contribution of Gravenberch in a crucial opening Champions League win.What's next for Liverpool?Liverpool face Everton in the Merseyside derby at Anfield on Saturday at 12:30 BST before another home game, this time against Championship side Southampton in the Carabao Cup third round, on Tuesday, 23 September.The Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.

away against them in the last campaign when they faced (2021-22 in the group stage).Since eliminating Liverpool from the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League with wins home and away in the last 16 (4-2 on aggregate), AtlÃ©tico Madrid have only won one of their last eight matches against English sides in the competition (D2 L5), winning 1-0 at Manchester United in March 2022.Liverpool boss Arne Slot has faced Diego Simeoneâs AtlÃ©tico Madrid on two previous occasions in Europe, losing home (1-3) and away (2-3) against them in the 2023-24 UEFA Champions League group stage. Despite conceding six goals and scoring just three, Slotâs Feyenoord had a higher xG (3.6 â 2.1) and more shots (29 â 16) across the two meetings combined.AtlÃ©tico Madrid have only lost one of their last 10 opening games of a UEFA Champions League campaign (W5 D4), with that lone defeat coming away to Bayern Munich in October 2020 (4-0 to the German side).AtlÃ©tico Madrid have kept a clean sheet in 42% of their UEFA Champions League matches under Diego Simeone (48/115); the highest percentage for any Spanish team to play 50+ games under a specific manager, ahead of Pep Guardiolaâs Barcelona (40% - 20/50).Liverpool finished top of the league phase in the 2024-25 edition, winning the most games and most points of any side (P8 W7 D0 L1 â 21 points). They won all four of their league phase matches at Anfield by an aggregate score of 10-1, including a win over then reigning champions Real Madrid (2-0).Mohamed Salah has scored more goals (44) and made more assists (17) than any other Liverpool player in the UEFA Champions League. If he features here, he will also move into outright second for most appearances for the Reds in the competition, overtaking Steven Gerrard (73), and trailing only Jamie Carragher (80).Antoine Griezmann has either scored or assisted 26% of AtlÃ©tico Madridâs goals in the UEFA Champions League (51/197); the highest percentage by any player for a team who have scored 100+ goals in the competitionâs history, ahead of Lionel Messi with Barcelona (25% - 155/612).Of centre back duos or trios with 5+ starts in the UEFA Champions League last season, Liverpool duo Virgil Van Dijk and Ibrahima KonatÃ© had the highest clean sheet percentage of any partnership (71% - 5/7).AtlÃ©tico Madridâs Koke is one of only four players in UEFA Champions League history to make 100+ appearances under one manager (102 for Diego Simeone), along with Ryan Giggs (134), Paul Scholes (124) and Gary Neville (109), all for Manchester United under Alex Ferguson.Live TextPostat 90 minutes plus 790'+7Match ends, Liverpool 3, Atletico Madrid 2.Full Timeat 90 minutes plus 790'+7Second Half ends, Liverpool 3, Atletico Madrid 2.Postat 90 minutes plus 790'+7Attempt saved.
