Burnley boss Scott Parker, speaking to BBC Match of the Day: "Tough, really tough. I am gutted for the players, that is the main thing. We took the game to the 93rd minute and a penalty has decided it."Immensely proud of the group, what we needed to do today and how we set up."The boys took everything on board I am just gutted for them it was decided by a penalty."I don't put it as a mistake [for the penalty]. The ball is coming from three yards away at a ridiculous speed. Maybe the learning from it is that we coach defenders to put their hands behind their back, which is not ideal."This is a young team, a new team. Today at times we had to survive. We had to dig and go to places not many humans go to. It would be easy to tap out, my team did not tap out."

More from Arne Slot to BBC Match Of The Day on his decision not to include new striker Alexander Isak in his matchday squad: "You make a choice for a good reason, for a good argument. That choice was because he missed out for four months on team training. "He's in his second or third week of pre-season. We have given him a proper week and then we think maybe he will get more than 10 or 15 minutes in our Wednesday game and that's the way to build him up. He needs proper playing time but also build him up so he has a good base."

Liverpool boss Arne Slot to BBC Match Of The Day: "Compliments to Burnley for the way they defended. It was difficult for us to find an opening and a few times we were close. if we had scored the game may have been open but because we didn't they did the same thing. We had to wait until the end phase of the second half and in the final stages we got what were hoping for."There is a chance it will fall in the way you want but it was difficult because they had players behind the ball. We needed a moment of luck, or a moment of magic. We didn't have the magic but we had the luck. You are hoping and trying to make it more difficult but they were strong."Mo Salah for as long as he has been at Liverpool has been good for us. It was a great moment for us because I think he missed the last two."On his decision to replace Milos Kerkez with Andy Robertson in the 38th minute: "It was because he got a yellow card. I think the fans here thought a chance for them to win the game is if we ended up with a second yellow. "With Milos I can never be 100% he doesn't make the next foul, then the fans are on top of the referee. I thought the only way we could lose it today was if we went down to 10 men."

Liverpool boss Arne Slot, speaking to Sky Sports: "I settled really bad because after 90 minutes when I saw how much added time there was I was shocked. I was still shocked when we got the penalty because five minutes of added time for me was unbelievable. Shocked and then happy Mo scored the penalty."It wasn't a game we created a lot of chances, it is hard against a team who plays in their box. We kept playing, we kept moving the ball around. They got more and more tired which is normal when you have to defend for 80% of time and then we got as many attackers on as possible."Difficult game but all of them are in the Premier League. A clean sheet and from open play we hardly concede a chance. That's a good thing. "It is normal and a lot of new players, we will get better and better but in the meantime we have 12 points."On Alexander Isak: "Now he is ready to play at least 45 minutes. Let's see if we will use that on Wednesday or on Saturday."

Burnley boss Scott Parker, speaking to Sky Sports: "I've seen disappointments in my time and my career. At times we survived like our life depended on it today. We knew we had to give that."The overriding factor here is that everything we set about to be today I am immensely proud of the players. The game ends in a real heartbreaking way for us. It is what it is."We just fell a little bit short with the last-minute penalty."We needed to deny space, that was critical for us, and we did that. We defended very, very well. We didn't look much of a threat going forward but it is what it is. We are trying to get a result and we are trying to survive it is just a shame the way it ended."It is handball. In the law of it it is handball. We will have to change in the technique of defending things with hands behind the back. But really proud of the team."On Hannibal Mejbri: "I have been in the arena, I know how quick things move. His body action was turning and his arm has gone out. The ball is probably coming at 80mph and it has hit it. The only learning for Hannibal is that we will have to train with hands behind the back."My team today epitomised spirit."

"We did such a good game, keeping it tight and hoping to see the game through then this moment comes. Of course it's going to happen. It's so typical and not a nice moment."It's one mistake in the end. Last week it cost us and it's very unfortunate. We are doing a good game, following our game plan and we are a few seconds from one point. It just feels typical to concede those types of goal."We followed our game plan so well it became hard for them. We knew how to play and everyone was sticking to it. I think we have to be happy with the performance. Both last week and this week we are so close to getting a point."

A well deserved win but if I am Burnley it is never nice to concede a penalty. "At the end of the day it was a penalty and Mo scored it perfectly.

Home keeper Martin Dubravka saved superbly from Dominik Szoboszlai in the second half and substitute Federico Chiesa headed wide seconds after coming on.Burnley were reduced to 10 men for the last six minutes when Lesley Ugochukwu received a second yellow card from referee Michael Oliver for a foul on Florian Wirtz, having earlier been booked for a challenge on Alexis Mac Allister.Liverpool kept pushing and got their reward, which means they have won each of their Premier League games with goals inside the last 10 minutes, including winners in added time at Newcastle United and here at Burnley.Burnley, meanwhile, have lost twice to stoppage-time spot-kicks after suffering a similar fate at Manchester United.'Forget Fergie time - now it's Arne Time'Published14 SeptemberWhat did you make of Liverpool's display?Have your say on Burnley's performanceLiverpool analysis: Reds leave it late againTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.This video can not be playedMedia caption, 'Moment of luck' - Slot on late penalty winnerLiverpool's strong start to the Premier League season has been built on late winners and here was another, Burnley having been seconds away from what would have been a superb result.The champions scored in the 88th minute and then in the fourth minute of stoppage time to beat Bournemouth in their opening game at Anfield. Teenager Rio Ngumoha scored a 100th-minute winner at Newcastle United.Szoboszlai's decisive free-kick against Arsenal came seven minutes from time, while Salah did the trick at Turf Moor.It reflects the fact that Liverpool have not been at their best, despite recording four straight wins, but also illustrates the steel that runs through this side along with the skill.And there is also the psychological impact of Liverpool's relentless approach, perhaps resulting in Hannibal's needless handball that took away a precious point from Burnley.Liverpool can now start their Champions League campaign against Atletico Madrid at Anfield on Wednesday on the back of another domestic victory, with Slot revealing Isak will be involved against the Spanish side.Burnley analysis: Parker's men can take heartTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.This video can not be playedMedia caption, "My team didn't tap out" - Parker proud of Burnley despite late Liverpool lossScott Parker's most painful brush with Liverpool ended in a 9-0 defeat at Anfield when he was Bournemouth manager in August 2022, resulting in his sacking days later.This was almost complete redemption for Parker, as his Burnley side defended magnificently and with superb organisation until Hannibal's reckless moment undermined the efforts.Parker was the picture of agony in his technical area, as he was at Old Trafford when Bruno Fernandes' injury-time penalty allowed Manchester United to snatch victory in Burnley's previous league game.Parker can take huge encouragement from both performances, however, as Burnley kept Liverpool at arm's length until tired legs and tired minds took over in the closing stages.Kyle Walker showed why his vast experience will be vital to their fight to stay in the Premier League and Maxime Esteve was superb in central defence.Parker and his players will feel bitter pain â but when that subsides there can also be pride.What's next for these teams?Burnley: The Clarets are at home to Nottingham Forest on Saturday, 20 September (15:00 BST). Burnley are then back at Turf Moor to face Cardiff City in the Carabao Cup third round on Tuesday, 23 September (19:45 BST).Liverpool: Slot's team start their Champions League campaign when Atletico Madrid come to Anfield on Wednesday, 17 September (20:00 BST).

The Reds have won seven away top-flight games in a row against three teams previously: West Brom (8 between 1983 and 2009), Norwich (8 between 1995 and 2021) and Crystal Palace (7 between 2016 and 2022).Liverpool are looking to win their opening four Premier League matches in a season for a third time, also doing so in 2018-19 (finished 2nd) and 2019-20 (won the title). It would be the third time in a row the reigning top-flight champions have won their first four games (also Man City in 2023-24 and 2024-25), the first time ever in top-flight history thatâs happened.Burnley have already shipped 37.5% of their total league goals from 2024-25 (16) in the Premier League this season (6). If they concede two in this game, itâd be the joint earliest in Football League history a side had already conceded 50% or more of their goal tally from the previous campaign, with Portsmouth in 1987-88 shipping 15 goals in four games, 54% of their previous seasonâs tally (28).Burnley won four of their first seven Premier League matches against the reigning champions (D1 L2) but theyâve since lost 10 of their last 11, conceding 30 goals in those 10 defeats. The exception in this run was a 1-0 away win at Liverpool in January 2021.Liverpool have scored in 37 consecutive Premier League matches, their longest run in top-flight history. Only Tottenham (39 in a row, March 2023 â March 2024) and Arsenal (55, May 2001 â November 2002) have scored in more Premier League matches in a row.Burnley have scored with none of their 15 attempts in the first halves of Premier League matches this season, but in the second half of games theyâve netted with four out of 12 shots, the best conversion rate after the break of any side (33%).This will be Burnley manager Scott Parkerâs first Premier League match against Liverpool since losing 9-0 with Bournemouth back in August 2022. He has beaten the Reds before however, a 1-0 win in March 2021, and could become the second manager to beat both JÃ¼rgen Klopp and Arne Slot in the Premier League, along with Marco Silva.Liverpoolâs Florian Wirtz has made the most off-ball runs in the Premier League this season (92), while heâs also made the most runs into the attacking third (42) and most runs ahead of the ball (26).Alexander Isak is set to make his Liverpool debut in this match â between 2022-23 and 2024-25, only two players scored more Premier League goals than he did (54). Two players (Hugo EkitikÃ© and Rio Ngumoha) have scored on their debuts this season, with 1946-47 the last time more Reds player scored on their top-flight debuts in one campaign (Len Carney, Billy Liddell, Albert Stubbins, Cyril Done, William Watkinson).Best of the BBCWayne relives footballâs fiercest rivalriesAttributionSoundsHow an unregulated US market is changing our relationship to deathAttributionSoundsA true story of survival after a devastating plane crashAttributionSoundsWhat foods could help reduce your risk of dementia?AttributionSoundsHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCBBC emails for youAdvertise with usCopyright Â© 2025 BBC.
