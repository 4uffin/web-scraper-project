Burnley boss Scott Parker on his relationship with the Burnley supporters and their collective underdog mentality: "It is something that is definitely important for me, as well as the football club and the supporters. There is no stronger club than a club where everyone is on the same page and pushing in the right direction."We all understand the challenges that football poses and that at times we can lose football matches. There is no knee-jerk reaction, we have a real honest reflection on things. I certainly feel a real togetherness in what we are this year. I understand it and I try to deliver that message constantly to this group."We will be the underdogs at times. We are going to have to fight, scrap and do everything in our power to survive in certain moments."

Image source, Getty ImagesBurnley boss Scott Parker on Kyle Walker's impact since arriving at the club this summer and his return to Etihad Stadium: "He has been massive for us really because of his experience and his quality. We've all seen his quality in a real short period of time."The biggest compliment I can pay to him is his reaction to the different environment and different way of playing here."When bringing him to Turf Moor, I had absolutely no doubt that he would embrace every bit of it - and he has done that. I've never seen frustration in him, instead I've seen a positive mindset."

Burnley boss Scott Parker on travelling to Etihad Stadium to face Pep Guardiola's Manchester City: "I personally don't see many tougher challenges really. They are a football club that have been in and around eliteness for years now, so we have a big challenge ahead of us for sure."We have come through tricky fixtures already this season though, so that fills me with confidence. However, there's no doubt we are coming up against a colossus of a team - we understand that."At times we will have to suffer, but we will adopt a confidence and a belief that we can show the best version of ourselves and hopefully cause them problems."

Image source, Getty ImagesBurnley boss Scott Parker on whether his team are where he expected after the opening five games: "I think we are in a really good place. We've had some really tough and challenging fixtures to start this season, we felt that would be the case from when they were revealed, but we feel we have been hugely competitive and very positive."We've had to show some resilience at times, which has been hugely encouraging for me as a manager. We have been posed some tough challenges and have taken some real encouragement from them."We have been on the wrong end of a couple of those results in the last minute with two penalties, but overall I'm really pleased with where we are."

Image source, Getty ImagesBurnley's return to the Premier League has seen them face Spurs and Manchester United away, whilst also welcoming champions Liverpool to Turf Moor.That is difficult enough but this weekend sees them travel to Manchester City.Their only win this season was against fellow promoted side Sunderland and perhaps they deserved more against Liverpool and United, both of whom scored late penalties to snatch three points from Scott Parker's men.Burnley's Premier League results:
Spurs 3-0 Burnley
Burnley 2-0 Sunderland
Manchester United 3-2 Burnley
Burnley 0-1 Liverpool

Sunderland boss Regis le Bris on spending around Â£20m on defenders Omar Alderete and Nordi Mukiele this summer and the impact they have had this season: "I'm not sure that the price is connected with their quality because the market can get crazy just by competition between two clubs, so the most important thing is the football value that they bring rather than the monetary value."They have both shown good qualities on the pitch and they are being consistent, which is a big positive."

Image source, Getty ImagesJust a heads up for you, Steve - well, for everyone who might not have clocked this - but the Africa Cup of Nations actually starts on 21 December this year and runs until 18 January, rather than beginning in early January as we've become used to in recent times.It means the likes of Mohamed Salah, Bryan Mbeumo and Rayan Ait-Nouri, to name but a few, are going to be missing during the busy festive period as well as potentially two and a half weeks in January.A blow for Premier League clubs but it works well for leagues with winter breaks and also ensures that participating players don't miss any Champions League or Europa League games.

Sunderland have had a relatively easier start to the season then Leeds and Burnley. They also lose players to the African Cup of Nations in the New Year. They could suffer for that reason.

Sunderland boss Regis le Bris was asked whether Chris Rigg, who was a key figure in the Black Cats' promotion charge, can step up and fill the boots of injured Habib Diarra: "Yes, probably. He played really well last season in the Championship. He showed his qualities and his consistency as well because the Championship is really tough. He was probably a bit exhausted at the end of it."This season, he got an early injury so he wasn't connected with the squad in the beginning, but he worked hard to reconnect with the squad."So when he had the opportunity to start after Habib's [Diarra] injury, it was just natural. I wasn't surprised about that and I wasn't worried about using a new player because he works hard every day, he knows how we play and he has lots of talent."
166Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingNottingham Forest 'a dangerous opponent'published at 14:13 BST 25 September14:13 BST 25 SeptemberNottingham Forest v Sunderland (Sat, 17:30 BST)Sunderland
Sunderland boss Regis le Bris on whether it's a good time to play Nottingham Forest, who are still searching for their first win under new head coach Ange Postecoglou: "I'm not sure, we will see after the game."What we know about them is that they have a strong squad with many threats. Their wingers and strikers are good footballers, their players are well organised. They are offensive with a strong mindset, so they are a dangerous opponent."We won't get any gifts from them so we'll have to play our best football to try to control their threats and play our offensive style to score."

Leeds boss Daniel Farke on summer signing Sebastiaan Bornauw missing out on the squad: "This was one of my toughest decisions and it really has hurt me to not involve him."We have four specialists in the centre-back position and if you are really honest you have positions where you will make substitutions but that position, if there are no injuries, then you are not tempted to change it."We can't afford to have two centre-backs on the bench. He has done nothing wrong but he had an injury in pre-season."

Sunderland boss Regis le Bris on having not scored a first half goal this season: "The games are often like that. They are more stable and well-organised in the first half, so that probably makes it harder to score."The games do become a bit more open and chaotic in the second half, so defences are probably a bit more vulnerable."It's also the case that you probably understand your opponent more after 45 minutes so you are able to find more opportunities, so I think that pattern is natural."

Leeds boss Daniel Farke on Dominic Calvert-Lewin: "[The goal against Wolves] was very important for him and it is a sign that he is on a good path."I have to say from the day he walked in he has been brilliant. His attitude in the dressing room and leading the young players has been very important."He tries in a more natural way to take on more responsibility in the dressing room but the most important responsibility is what he does on the pitch and so far it has been good."

Sunderland boss Regis le Bris on 24-year-olds Jay Matete and Joe Anderson not being part of his first team squad or the Under-21s: "They are still training with a group because we need to take care of them, but they aren't involved with the core of the squad right now."They are probably waiting for the next transfer window to find a new opportunity."It's not ideal [to have a few players in this position], but football is like that. Sometimes you have the perfect pathway and sometimes it isn't the case. We just have to manage the situation properly."

Leeds boss Daniel Farke on being under the radar: "At Leeds you are never under the radar because at this club there are so many talking points and this club is so emotional."To be under the radar as a newly promoted club is usually a good sign. I would prefer to be top of the league right now and in the spotlight rather than be under the radar but overall we have done fantastic."

Sunderland boss Regis Le Bris on Reinildo Mandava and covering the left-back's position: "When we built this squad, we used the recommended structure as per the sporting director."We talked about having different options so I think we have a player to cover this position."We have versatility as well to create other options depending on the scenario, the opponent and the dynamic of the squad."
