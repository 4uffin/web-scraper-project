Everton manager Brian Sorensen: "In the first half, we were too far from [our best]. We had a talk at half-time about what we need to change but then a mistake and an early goal and it becomes hard for us to break them down because they sit in. "Collectively and individually we weren't sharp enough. We were too slow. We need to look at it and better on Friday. "In the week leading up to it, we were buzzing playing in here [at Goodison Park] and we need to have more energy for sure."On where his side need to improve: "Just that energy and belief. We're a good team and we need to get that to work."On playing at Goodison Park: "We're proud and honoured to be here. We will try to make it our home and a fortress but it didn't start like that today."

Everton's Katja Snoeijs: "Overall, energy-wise, they won every duel. They were stronger today. "We had trouble to get pressure on the ball. We didn't have energy when we finally got the ball and we lost it way too quick as well."

Tottenham manager Martin Ho speaking to BBC Sport: "For the team, it's big. It's the first time we've had two clean sheets since March 2024. The West Ham one was the first in nine months. "We've only had five weeks together but I've told the players it doesn't cost money to work hard. The biggest thing for me is off the ball we have to be hard to beat and I think we've shown that."On Cathinka Tandberg's goal: "She did it in training this week. We were working on the defensive structure and she did it over Lize Kop's head. We all started laughing [when she scored]. Forwards are always aware of where the keeper is so they're always thinking 'can I score?'. I'm not surprised she did that."On facing Man City next: "We have to go in with confidence and belief that we can compete. They've got most of their better players back, so we know we'll have to suffer at times but if we defend the way we can and show instinct going forward, we'll have a chance."

Great performance from Spurs. Of course, Tandberg's goal stands out for its pure class, but the team performance has been excellent. Deserved win.Mattie1

Tottenham goal-scorer Cathinka Tandberg speaking to BBC Sport: "It was a tough game but we did good. Offensively, we have to be creative. In the first half, we had a lot of chances. I had some big chances. in the second half, I wanted a goal and when the goalkeeper is that far out you've got to take it. "I do it sometimes in training and at my last club. You've just got to go for it. When you do it, it's unbelievable."On whether it's the best goal of her career: "When you think about the league and where you're playing, yes. "When I'm in the moment, I'm a forward and the only thing I want to do is score goals."On what Tottenham can achieve: "I said top three but everyone laughed at me. We have to do better than last year. Take those three points against teams we're better than. We're doing that today and West Ham, it's an important three points."

Everton were second-best in every department. They never really got in the game. They were bossed in midfield.

Disappointment for Everton as they mark an historic day with defeat.The players look gutted. They wanted to begin their new Goodison Park tenancy with victory but they simply weren't good enough.Spurs had the better of them in every department.
