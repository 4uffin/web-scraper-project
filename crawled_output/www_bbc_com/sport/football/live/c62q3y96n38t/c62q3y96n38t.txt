Image source, Getty ImagesWhen Ruben Amorim first came I was heartened by them playing three at the back but every single game he changes the back three, which tells me he is not sure which back three he should play. And he changes the back five. There were a lot of individual errors out there today. Luke Shaw had one of the worst games I have seen him have. All three goals he could have done better. It was a nothing from United. They are 14th in the league only four games in and we all said that they can't be getting to October where they are 14th or 15th in the league or the manager will be in trouble. There are a few games to go but they have to start winning quickly.

Man City boss Pep Guardiola, speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live: "Really good â the faces of the fans after the game how happy they are. That's how privileged we are to do what we do. "You know why I'm a good manager? Because I have incredible players playing at their best. "We need our best. Today we saw, we create and that has to continue."On Gianluigi Donnarumma: "Of course he makes an incredible save, and we are really pleased with the way he played."

No player has scored more goals in Premier League Manchester derbies than Cityâs Erling Haaland (eight, level with Sergio Aguero and Wayne Rooney), with team-mate Phil Foden just behind with seven. Indeed, 15 of Man Cityâs last 17 league goals against United have been scored by either Haaland or Foden.

Image source, Getty ImagesManchester City forward Phil Foden, speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live: "It meant a lot to me to get back on the scoresheet and to start a game. I was training well at the start of the season, but I managed to pick up two ankle injuries, which was really frustrating. "You can see the emotion when I scored. I have been working really hard, and I wanted to put that into the game. "I am not one for speaking off the pitch. I let everyone do that for me. I keep focused on what I can control and that's on the pitch. I came off the Club World Cup where I thought I looked better. "I am happy with where I am at the moment. I'm feeling happy, and I want to keep putting the work in on the training ground. Hopefully, I can get even better."On Man City having a reset: "I feel like after the last two results the little break will have done a world of good. Today has been a big build up. What I like today is we mixed it up. Maybe in the past we have not done that. It is good to show we have that side to us that we can stick in there and defend as well."On Ricky Hatton: "I was lucky to meet him a couple of times. When you meet people for the first time, you never forget how they were on the first time. Lovely guy and a massive City fan â I made sure I tried my best for him. "I wanted to get the win for him and his family. Devastating news."

The only validation that United are getting in a 3-4-3 is that when they switch the play it looks good. But there is nothing else.It is how they are effective. They either attack quickly or switch the play. The two midfielders in front of the back three are so rigid. If Ugarte doesn't jump out level with Bruno Fernandes I don't think that first goal happens.

have got two in midfield against Man City's three. How are they supposed to cope with that?The centre-back has to jump but they are not jumping at the correct time. You have to be in the right positions. If you have five at the back and two in midfield it is impossible to get anywhere near them.I genuinely believe Man Utd would be better in a 4-3-3. They have the players for it and this system is hindering them.

This United team lack that real quality. They struggle defensively. There are obviously issues. You talk about the system but the manager is sticking to his guns he is not budging. You look at the results and the points per game, goals for and against. It is not good reading. It does concern me. As soon as the game starts you are worried but you get that feeling against any decent team. They have scored four goals and two of them were penalties. So they are not a free-scoring team. It is almost the same problems as last year.We were told the manager needed a pre-season, his own players and they have spent over Â£200m so we keep making excuses. When are we going to see signs?You see Slot going into Liverpool, they end up winning the league and Frank to Spurs, are they improving? Yeah.My worry is... maybe the players haven't got that much faith in it. As much as the manager is saying 'this is where we are going', as the results don't come and you are getting beaten by the better teams, he is making loads of changes... it is like they are going round in circles.We gave him the benefit of the doubt when he first came in.

It's hard because defensively it's not Bruno Fernandes' strength. He doesn't think danger straight away.
That's where you need a different person who can do that side of it. But when you only have one in Ugarte, or whoever it might be. it's difficult for him. It's been a a pattern of a few of the goals that there's been runners off the back of him, but you would think at some point it would click that its not in his system. He's not a defensive-minded player. He wants to be forward and score goals and effect the game that way.

Image source, Getty ImagesManchester City boss Pep Guardiola, speaking to Sky Sports on getting belief back: "We changed a lot in this transfer window, adding nine players, the core of the team. It is impossible to think about them and achieve what we achieved. The spirit, the body language, to fight altogether, to see the faces around the pitch. It's a privilege to bring joy and some moments of happiness because I know how much the derby means. "It is just one game. We did many good things against Tottenham. Today it means a lot, the players were so aggressive. Everyone was like a machine. We play Napoli on Thursday and we have to react and be less naÃ¯ve. Last season and this season we have been so poor in those terms but the spirit is there and the captains are fantastic."On Erling Haaland: "Erling has been incredible since the start but this season he is better than ever. I would say better than the Treble year. He's dynamic and I don't judge him for the clearance, we want him to score goals and to help us."On Phil Foden: "We missed him so much and the season before he was the best player in the Premier League so we need him, he has a work ethic. Phil is the core, the heart of the club, from the academy and he loves City. To have him back is good news."

We know Haaland's strengths. You have one of the best strikers in the world running from the halfway line and there was never any doubt he was going to finish it. He probably could have scored a few more.You talk about a team player, you have to give him praise for coming back and doing a good job defensively.

Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim, speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live: "Really disappointing when you lose 3-0 against City. If you look at the moment of the game, the three goals we can avoid it. "First goal â the lack of aggressiveness. Second goal â we were playing better when we started the second half, one throw in, one against one and Leny Yoro going outside rather than inside. "The third goal is a confusion in the middle of the park and Haaland has the space to run into. I think the moments of the game we could avoid. "Of course, there are a lot of things we need to change. I felt that when we were near the box we needed to put more bodies in the box for crosses. "That is something we need to improve. We are getting there with the ball, but we need to be more clinical." On Benjamin Sesko: "He is going to feel that he is in the strongest league in the world. We can help Sesko to use his qualities, but it will take time."

In these big games, he knows when to come out of his shell. Of course, he had a great week internationally as well. He's coming back with so much confidence and he's already got an abundance of confidence anyway. He's got a presence and aura about him. Will he beat Alan Shearer's Premier League record? We'll see.

Image source, Getty ImagesManchester United boss Ruben Amorim speaking to Sky Sports: "We had a big team in the certain moments. If you look at the three goals, we can avoid the three goals. We can be more aggressive. "In these kind of games, with top teams the small margins will make the difference. The performance is not good, in certain moments they were better than us and in the end you don't have a good feeling.On where he feels United are at: "We play against one coach that won seven Premier League titles and we are building things, trying to fight against these teams. I am not going to defend myself, it's always the same question, trying to protect myself. We need to do better. "If I look to the game, last year we draw and won against City and today we were a little bit better but in the small details it was clearly not goof enough. We are building things but of course we need to win."I'm not happier. I didn't see one player in my team not giving the maximum. The rest is with me. The disappointment sometimes I feel we could run more, but I didn't have that feeling today. It's my fault, not their fault and I am fine with that. "I know it's hard on our fans but again, I cannot point to one player [about lack of] effort. With game intelligence we can improve but that is my fault and we can improve."

You look at the start of the season. It is four points and four goals from four games and conceded seven. And they lost at Grimsby as well.
For all the money they have spent. United are a very average team. There are no signs that things are getting better for them.

Image source, Getty ImagesDo you know what? He won the Champions League. Everyone keeps going on about Donnarumma, yeah of course he's a very good goalkeeper. He keeps it out the net. He prevented Arsenal going through, which frustrated myself watching that game.He's an incredible keeper, you've got someone like this at the back, he's only 26. Pep's gone a different way with the keeper and I don't mind that.You've seen the amount of times with keepers these days on set pieces getting bullied but nobody will bully him. He's so commanding and has a presence. You've seen with England taking penalties against him, he's a big presence.It's an incredible save. Mbeumo did everything right except score. It's his job to keep it out of the net and, as well, he wasn't bad with his feet today. I know it's only one game but he's a good keeper. He was always a good keeper.

Is just a joke. I think we have bigger problems," he said.Amorim's side, who went into the derby ahead of their rivals in the table for the first time since 2020, did well for long periods. Yet it was City who secured a deserved and very comfortable 3-0 win because, when it really mattered, they were a different class to their visitors.They had a couple of opportunities to really threaten the home goal in the first half. Unfortunately, on the first occasion, Amad Diallo's pass to Bryan Mbeumo was overhit and too wide. On the second Benjamin Sesko played Mbeumo into trouble when a better execution would have sent the Cameroon forward clear.On his first Premier League start, Sesko had one opportunity when he was sent running at the City goal, only for the Slovenian to take a heavy first touch and chip his shot into Gianluigi Donnarumma, who had closed the gap right down.Presented with a similar situation in the second half, Haaland forced his way past Matthijs de Ligt and Luke Shaw and then calmly chipped over an advancing Altay Bayindir.Amorim was right. He has much bigger problems than Guardiola.That is the easy bit. The big question is how can he solve them?To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.This video can not be playedMedia caption, Man Utd a team with round pegs in square holes - analysisWhat next for these two sides?Manchester City: Guardiola's side begin their Champions League campaign by hosting Serie A champions Napoli on Thursday (20:00 BST kick-off).Manchester United: With no European football this season, Amorim's men host unbeaten Chelsea next Saturday (17:30 BST).The Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.

They are looking for consecutive wins at the Etihad for the first time since March 2021.Since 2015-16, the home team has ended on the winning side in just six out of 20 Premier League meetings in the Manchester derby (D4 L10). Indeed, since then, the only Premier League fixture to see more away wins (10) is Crystal Palace vs Liverpool (12).Manchester City have lost two of their first three Premier League matches for the first time since the 2004-05 campaign (W1), while it is the fewest points (3) ever collected by Pep Guardiola in his first three league games of a season. The last time City lost three of their first four games was in 1995-96, a season they were eventually relegated.Manchester United registered their eighth win in 30 Premier League matches under RÃºben Amorim (D7 L15) thanks to their 3-2 win over newly promoted Burnley on MD3. Half of Amorimâs wins have been against promoted sides, with the Portuguese manager holding just a 16% win ratio against sides not promoted to the division that campaign (4 wins in 25).Manchester United have had 58 shots in the Premier League this season, 14 more than any other side. Itâs their most shots in the first three games of a season since 2017-18 (60).Pep Guardiola has lost 49 of his 345 Premier League matches (W247 D49), with 22% of those coming since the start of last November (11). A defeat in this game would see him take the second largest number of games to lose 50, behind Sir Alex Ferguson, whose 50th defeat wasnât until his 367th match.Manchester United have made the most off-ball runs in behind their opponentâs defensive line in the Premier League this season (131), with forward Bryan Mbeumo responsible for 54 of those â the most of any player. Three of the five most in-behind runs by a player in a match so far in 2025-26 have been Mbeumo, with a high of 22 against Burnley last time out.Man Utd captain Bruno Fernandes has created the most chances in the Premier League this season so far both overall (12) and in open play (8). Fernandes has also scored in each of Unitedâs last three wins against Man City in the competition (March 2021, January 2023, December 2024).Both Man Cityâs Gianluigi Donnarumma and Man Utdâs Senne Lammens could make their Premier League debuts in this game. Excluding MD1 games, in only two Premier League games have both clubs given a debut to goalkeepers: Nottingham Forest (Andy Marriott) vs Spurs (Kevin Dearden) in April 1993 and Charlton Athletic (Darren Randolph) vs Liverpool (Daniele Padelli) in May 2007.HomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCBBC emails for youAdvertise with usCopyright Â© 2025 BBC.
