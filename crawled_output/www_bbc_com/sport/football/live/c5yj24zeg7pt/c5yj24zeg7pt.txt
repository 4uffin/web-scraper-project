Image source, Rex FeaturesSwansea City head coach Alan Sheehan speaking to Sky Sports:"We had a big meeting after the Hull game where we conceded in the 97th minute. The manner of the 15 minutes leading up to that was what the meeting was about, the mentality and what we want to be about," he said."Today we weren't really playing against Nottingham Forest, we were playing against ourselves because we want to be a certain type of team."We wanted to put our stamp on the game. I think we were incredibly unfortunate to be 2-0 down at half time."To keep going to the very end I think that's really important and credit to the players, they've got that belief. It's a wonderful win."I think some of our possession work tonight was absolutely incredible."You want to test yourself against that type of team and that type of players."I'm very proud of the players, they deserve all of the praise."We won the game, I know it's quite mad at the end, but I think we deserved it."

We await the arrival of the managers in the press conference room that, as it happens, is right next to the away dressing room.The walls aren't too thick so it's safe to say Postecoglou raised his voice when speaking to his players after that.

Image source, Getty ImagesNottingham Forest boss Ange Postecoglou speaking to Sky Sports:"I just thought it was a game we really should have killed off long before it got to the stage that it did," he said."I got the sense we were getting a bit comfortable and thought the game would finish off easily but that's not what happens, particularly in cup football. I thought we scored a good third goal."I think the lads got a bit comfortable in that moment and you've got to know the warning signs."We had to finish them off and we had plenty of opportunities to do that, and a couple of decisions didn't go our way."Players just thought it would naturally finish that way and we've paid a heavy price for that. We need to improve."They (Swansea) had two shots from outside the box in the first half and didn't really test us until right at the end."There were a lot of players out there who needed some football, but even within that context we were well in control of that game and should have seen it out."I was just frustrated that we didn't realise the danger that could have developed by not being more clinical and killing off the opponent when we should have."

We need that, he knows that and he's taken it on his shoulders. Long may it continue."We said before the game to have belief.

Squeezing his shot in from the far post, it was the Brazil international's first goal since his winner against Paris St-Germain at the Club World Cup.Swansea carried greater urgency, but not the threat and the tie looked effectively settled in the final moments of the first half as clever work from James McAtee down the Forest right picked out Hutchinson who provided a tap-in for Jesus.Burgess' glancing header from Eom Jisung's corner gave Swansea hope and raised noise levels that exploded when Vipotnik turned home Liam Cullen's cross three minutes into stoppage time.And any hopes of penalties saving Postecoglou from embarrassment were denied by Burgess rifling home as Forest failed to clear a corner in the seventh additional minute.To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.This video can not be playedMedia caption, 'It's never over till it's over' - Sheehan on late Forest winAnalysis: 'Angeball' evident, but work to do as Swansea offer hopeAfter defeat at Emirates Stadium, Postecoglou promised this would be the game where the first signs of his influence on the team he inherited from Nuno Espirito Santo would be visible.He did not have time to waste, he said.And at the very least, the Australian will have gained a greater idea of what he has at his disposal after handing first starts to talent that cost the club the best part of Â£120m over the summer.He would have had every right to have been impressed with Jesus, the striker nicknamed the 'Little Frog', who jumped at the opportunity to open his account in the south Wales rain.More importantly for Forest, Jesus' second was an example of the kind of football associated with Postecoglou's teams as a sweeping move cut the hosts open and made it easy for the striker to finish.There were signs too of Juventus loanee Douglas Luiz's class and what the likes of Hutchinson and McAtee could provide.But there were also signs â as if the result did not make it obvious - that the former Spurs boss has plenty of work to do.It was Swansea who looked to have the kind of tempo 'Angeball' is meant to have, pressing hard from the front with intensity.And although Forest could point to spurned chances from a number of players, it would be tough to say that Swansea did not earn the win.Ethan Galbraith and Mallick Yalcouye impressed and showed why there is renewed hope of the Swans pushing for a return to the Premier League.Given this was the first time they have beaten top-flight opposition in 10 cup ties since dropping into the Championship in 2018, this result will only increase such hopes.What next for these two sides?Forest head to Burnley on Saturday (15:00 BST) looking for a first Premier League win of the season before the club's return to European competition after a 30-year wait when they travel to Real Betis in the Europa League next Wednesday.Swansea, meanwhile, head to Birmingham City for their next Championship fixture on Saturday (12:30 BST).Related topicsFootballMore on this storySheehan 'won't put water on fire' after Forest win Published18 SeptemberForest got too 'comfortable' in shock loss at SwanseaPublished17 SeptemberComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 744League Cup Scores & FixturesWednesday 17th SeptemberSwansea City 3 , Nottingham Forest 2 at Full timeSwanseaSwansea CitySwansea City32Nottm ForestNottingham ForestNottingham ForestFull timeFTView all League Cup fixturesTeam Lineupshome team, Swansea CityManager: Alan SheehanFormation: 4 - 2 - 3 - 1Pitch FormationDiagram of half a football pitch showing the home team formation.1, Fisher, Goalkeeper1Fisher2, Key, Defender2Key26, Casey, Defender26Casey15, Burgess, Defender15Burgess16, Samuels-Smith, Defender16Samuels-Smith17, GonÃ§alo Franco, Defensive Midfielder17GonÃ§alo Franco30, Galbraith, Defensive Midfielder30Galbraith21, Manuel Benson, Attacking Midfielder21Manuel Benson8, YalcouyÃ©, Attacking Midfielder8YalcouyÃ©10, Eom Ji-Sung, Attacking Midfielder10Eom Ji-Sung33, Idah, Striker33IdahStarting lineupNumber 1, A.
