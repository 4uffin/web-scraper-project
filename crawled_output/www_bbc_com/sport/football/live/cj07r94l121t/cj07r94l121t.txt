Chris Wood headed one of Madueke's deliveries to the edge of the box and Zubimendi hit a powerful volley past Matz Sels with a slight deflection from Murillo.Morgan Gibbs-White had the best chance for Forest when he shot wide from inside the penalty area following a counter-attack.The Gunners doubled their lead one minute into the second half when Eberechi Eze, making his first start for Arsenal, teed up Viktor Gyokeres to tap in from close range.Zubimendi then added his second with a header when he got on the end of substitute Leandro Trossard's cross. Arteta will be delighted with the performance his side put in, with a number of key players out injured and captain Martin Odegaard having to be replaced with what looked like a shoulder injury in the first half.'Not a project' - Postecoglou can't 'waste time' in Forest rebrandPublished13 SeptemberArsenal's 'scary show of strength' as Madueke shinesPublished13 SeptemberWhat did you make of Arsenal's display?What did you think about Nottingham Forest's performance?Arsenal analysis: Gunners dominateTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.This video can not be playedMedia caption, Arteta 'very pleased' with Arsenal's victory against ForestArsenal were criticised for their performance in the loss against Liverpool before the international break, but they brushed off that disappointment to dominate against Forest.In response, Arteta named an attacking side with Eze and Madueke either side of striker Gyokeres.In midfield, Mikel Merino was handed a start, after scoring a hat-trick against Turkey for Spain while on international duty, alongside Odegaard as Arsenal looked to take control of the game.Zubimendi, there to link up the play, scored two goals in the same game for the first time in his top-flight club career.Madueke, fresh from scoring his first England goal, continued that good form and was the Gunners' standout player.He was positive whenever he was on the ball and provided an outlet for his team. And Forest, following an injury to Murillo, moved Neco Williams to left-back in an attempt to keep Madueke quiet.Madueke was replaced to a standing ovation while the supporters inside the stadium sang his name.Cristhian Mosquera started alongside centre-back Gabriel in place of William Saliba, who is continuing his recovery from an ankle problem, and also put in an impressive performance.David Raya also reached a milestone as he made his 100th appearance for Arsenal and kept his 42nd clean sheet.Forest analysis: Postecoglou starts with defeatTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.This video can not be playedMedia caption, 'Players did everything they could' - Postecoglou on Forest defeat at ArsenalPostecoglou was only named Forest boss late on Tuesday, so the time on the training pitch will have been limited with his new squad.Forest also have a number of players away on international duty, which would have lessened the tactical work that Postecoglou was able to do.Even so, there were some noticeable changes to the side. Under former manager Nuno Espirito Santo, Forest became known for their organised defence and ability to counter-attack.In the early part of this match Forest did attempt to pressure Arsenal higher up the pitch but were forced back by the excellent Arsenal side.Supporters will not have been too hopeful heading to north London with Forest winning only two of their past 16 matches against Arsenal, and both of those came at home.Postecoglou again will not have much time to implement the expansive style he is known for, with a Carabao Cup game against Swansea City on Wednesday.What next for these teams?Arsenal are next in action on Tuesday when they play Athletic Bilbao in the Champions League.Forest play Swansea on Wednesday in the EFL Cup.The Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.
