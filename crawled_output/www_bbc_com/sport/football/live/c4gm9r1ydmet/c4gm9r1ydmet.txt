Fulham boss Marco Silva to BBC Sport: "Two in a row is very good for us. Very difficult to achieve.
The feeling is top. Well deserved. Thatâs the main thing. We were the best team from the first minute to the last one. Great first half, great football from us. We
dominated all the first half."We created many problems for them. The reaction was very
good from the mistake. I like the way the players support Josh King straight away. It was a difficult moment for him. The reaction from King was top. "Second goal, what an amazing
finish. It was a good challenge on set-pieces.
Many long throws, probably around 25. We handled it really well. We were brave
and well organised. The players kept their focus. Proud of the players. To have
a better wekened is what we want."On King: "He knows the trust we have in him heâs working very hard. Heâs
a top talent. I like his maturity too. I love how heâs so humble and has the
right mindset."

Brentford boss Keith Andrews told BBC Sport: "We started the game well and played in areas of pitch. We wanted to cause them
issues and we did that. The front two were a handful when we gave them the service. "The timing of goals wasnât
good and the manner of them was a bit disappointing."The first goal: "Two ways of looking at it - unlucky possibly but feel we could do more about it
in terms of aggression and anticipation."The second goal: "Again the manner of where it comes from, the basics of the game are important for me. How we set up for set-pieces including throw-ins, to match players. The manner of the goals didnât sit particularly well."Clean sheets are important to us. We're very aware we need to address
certain things and performance levels. We donât get too high when we win a game and
tonight we're clearly not happy with conceding three goals."We need to address certain aspects of our game. The
performance overall was disjointed. We lacked the quality at times, the final
little bit of quality was lacking."

Ooh that's me: Brentford used to play with ambition and desire didn't they? Tonight was both spineless and gutless from them - not looking good for them going out with a whimper against their local rivals.

Remember, Brentford took the lead in this game.That seems like an awful long time ago.The Bees have lost eight points from winning positions in the Premier League this season, more than any other team.Is it too soon for alarm bells to be sounding at the Gtech?

Meanwhile, two of the Cottagersâ three goals scored this term have come from set pieces.Only Burnley (30) have had fewer shots than Brentford (33) in the Premier League this season, with the Beesâ average of 8.3 shots per game their lowest in any of their five campaigns in the competition.Brentford have played fewer line breaking passes than any other side in the Premier League this season (132), with just five of these breaking the oppositionâs defensive line (also a league-low).No attacking player (strikers, attacking midfielders, wingers) has made more progressive carries in the Premier League this season than Fulhamâs Alex Iwobi (37).Brentfordâs Igor Thiago has applied more pressures in the opposition half than any other player in the Premier League this season (225).Brentford midfielder Jordan Henderson is set to appear in the 500th league game of his career across spells with Sunderland (71), Coventry (10), Liverpool (360), Al-Ettifaq (17), Ajax (37) and now the Bees (4 so far). This game comes 16 years and 323 days after his league debut for Sunderland v Chelsea in November 2008, which fell on the same day that now-manager Keith Andrews was making his eighth Premier League appearance for Blackburn against West Brom.HomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCBBC emails for youAdvertise with usCopyright Â© 2025 BBC.
