Liverpool boss Arne Slot, speaking on TNT Sports: "If you want to beat a team like Atletico which has an unbelievable mentality, you have to beat them with their weapon as well and that is mentality and that is what we showed again today that we can beat them with mentality. "I think we should've made it easier for ourselves, at 2-0 first half we got more than a few chances to make a third. At 2-1 second half we hit the post, we were so close a few times and if the margin is only one goal something can always happen and it happened, A little bit deflection I'm not sure but second ball went in, but again we showed mentality because in that 10 minutes that still had to be played we were pushing, pushing, pushing and we scored a set-piece goal."On if complacency crept in after going 2-0 up: "It can but it didn't happen too much with us this season that we were 2-0 up after six minutes, but it is clear that if we feel and need urgency then we are unbelievable and now we need to make sure we feel this urgency for 90 minutes. Don't even look at the score just feel this urgency every second."

It was the kind of performance that I expected from Chelsea. A lot of people were saying beforehand that they were going to break into this competition, they are Club World Cup champions and all of that, but I was thinking, 'steady on'. The jump you need to do to come to places like this is quite big and a number of players just don't have that experience yet. They weren't able to do it as a group today.

Atletico were dominating until they scored their equaliser, but then they dropped off because they had something to protect.Another Liverpool late show got them another win but they were sloppy in the second half. Scoring so many late goals is a positive but needing them, as well as conceding as many as they are doing, they are asking a lot of themselves to keep this up.You can hear more from Osman on MOTD: Uefa Champions League which is on BBC One and the BBC Sport website and app right now.

It wasn't quite men against boys, but Bayern Munich were certainly a good distance ahead of Chelsea here.The mistakes Chelsea made were quite naive and they were caught out, not just for the goals, but for a whole raft of chances aside from that. That's what happens with young players playing in this competition, but they will learn from that.This level is elite. It is a jump. And that jump may take them a little while.Bayern have a whole host of special players Olise in the first half and as the second half developed Kane he bestrode this match again.

A lot of the defenders were basically trying to stop these runs. Grabbing, pushing, pulling. I mean look at that and to still have the strength to push away. Wow, getting up and heading, it's just brilliant. He's such a threat at set-pieces.

Image source, Getty ImagesChelsea boss Enzo Maresca, speaking to TNT Sports: "Overall the performance was quitre good. We started well for 20 minutes and created two or three chances. When we conceded a goal we could have avoided the game changed a bit. "We were in the game, we scored a goal. The decision [not to send off Jonathan Tah] was tough because it was more a red card than yellow card. Even without that we started the second half well and created chances."Once we conceded the third goal the game changed again. We conceded a goal that killed the game. We were in the game until the end. With the penalty, the [non] red card, an own goal it becomes difficult."We can learn from this game. First of all this kind of game needs you to play the right way for 95 minutes, not just for part of the game. At times we weren't good enough."It was a good performance. Now it's time to recover because in two games we have a tough game."

Dallas Cowboys: Got the win to get off to a winning start. That is the most important thing. Still letting another two goal lead slip is concerning and once again having to score another very late goal to win it isnât for the faint hearted.

Image source, Getty ImagesMore from Liverpool boss Arne Slot, speaking on TNT Sports on Alexander Isak's debut: "Yeah, particularly because in the 60 minutes he played he seemed to be quite fit to me. It wasn't as if after 10 minutes he was already very tired. He could play at this level quite well after one or two weeks of team sessions. "So that was the thing and he can play football and that he's a joy to watch and that is not a surprise to me. He was fitter than I expected but the fans can't get their hopes too high. We play three times a week and that's a bit too much for him still."We have two great number nines and we're going to use both of them throughout their career here."

Bayern Munich striker Harry Kane, speaking to DAZN: "Amazing result. It was a tough game against a really good side. We said before the game they're club world champions. we had it to be on it from the start and we were."In the second half we created the better chances and it was good to get that second goal. As the game went on it felt like they got more tired, spaces opened up and we were able to exploit that."We talked a lot about when other teams try to play we're only two or three seconds from having a chance ourselves. It fell to me in a nice place and was a good finish."Hopefully more [goals this season than last season]. Always aim to improve and get better. In the Champions League we sometimes create more chances then in Bundesliga games because they're more open."

Atletico Madrid boss Diego Simeone, speaking to Uefa: "The truth is that it was a beautiful game, in a fantastic stadium in front of an incredible crowd, against a team full of great players. "We had our weapons and we gave our all to take the game in the direction that we wanted and I think we were dangerous."On what he expected from the game: "They [Liverpool] are a brave team, they showed that last season in their play, they competed well in the Champions League as well. We have our weapons and we arrived here with the aim to make a good game. "We know that these games are long. The bench helped to recover what happened in the first moments and then what happened, happened."

When you are as attacking minded as Liverpool are, you are going to give up chances to the opposition. Certainly against better opposition.Liverpool had so many chances and didn't finish the game off, that is part of the issue. If you don't finish an opponent off, especially a team like Atletico Madrid, you leave yourself open to conceding.Then as soon as you concede one you get a bit shaky and it takes just a little deflection to bring it level.

By the way, the highlights show which is about to start on BBC One is well worth watching just for the drama that unfolded at Anfield.Marcos Llorente's volley was world-class, Virgil van Dijk popped up with a stoppage-time winner in front of the Kop, and Diego Simeone completely lost it and was shown a red card.
