Hibs head coach David Gray tells Premier Sports: âWe got a point out of a game where our character was tested."Our defence was poor. The positive I can take is that we came back after finding ourselves 3-1 down."I told the players we gave them far too many chances and that we were miles off it today."We relied on our goalkeeper heavily, second half."For us, being at home, we werenât good enough defensively, and a lot of that was down to Dundee United being good too, but we need to be better defensively."I credit the players with their desire to go and get back into the game, but it feels like we're chasing too much."On the penalty and the incorrect VAR call in the previous game, Gray adds: "The whole point of VAR is to get decisions rightâ¦ Itâs all about accountability, and the officials coming out [to discuss decisions] is important that there is that accountability."Image source, SNS

Dundee United manager Jim Goodwin tells Premier Sports: "Firstly, I thought it was a fantastic game, a fantastic advert for the Scottish Premiership, two teams going at it, a lot of goalmouth action, and two keepers making great saves."Itâs a really harsh rule (for the penalty), Iâd hate to be a defender these days or a referee making those decisions."From our perspective, itâs two points dropped."Weâve made a couple of mistakes and a really difficult penalty [is given against us], and Sevelj gets a red card, and will now miss the next game for us. Heâs a really important player for us."I don't know what Sevelj is meant to do. I think it's harsh."I thought it was a brilliant game of football and I felt we should have won. All three goals we scored were really well-worked."Image source, SNSImage caption, Dundee United led 1-0 and 3-1 at Easter Road

Jim Goodwin is doing his Premier Sports interview and is maybe suggesting Hibs were given a penalty after being denied an absolute stonewaller against St Mirren last time - and the fallout from the subsequent VAR review.Cheeky? Or does he have a point?

Although Shankland's spot kick was saved by Butland, the striker slotted the rebound to leave the home side and their support stunned - and it could have been worse had TÃ³mas Bent MagnÃºsson not found the far post in the dying seconds.Sportscene highlights: Rangers v Hearts13/09/2025Watch on iPlayerAnalysis: Rangers nightmare leaves Hearts dreamingPressure can only mount on Martin from Rangers fans after another dismal result and display.The former Rangers defender talked about seeking a "reset" to build on their goalless draw with Celtic last time out and the work on the training ground that followed during the international break.There was little evidence of that in an opening 45 minutes full of nerves, with the disjointed hosts looking like a bunch of individuals facing a well-oiled machine rather than a cohesive unit.It looked every bit a match-up between a side sitting six points clear of hosts who had struggled to four opening draws.The defeat will increase the questions being asked about the continued absence of Nicolas Raskin despite the midfielder scoring for Belgium in midweek.Martin decided to start Canada centre-half Cornelius and big-money striker signing Youssef Chermiti on the bench and their introduction after the break came too late to change the course of the game.To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.This video can not be playedMedia caption, 'How long can this go on?' - Boos ring around IbroxHearts head coach Derek McInnes had asked his players to come to Ibrox with belief based on their early season form and they had that in spades.After more than a quarter of a century without an Aberdeen win in Glasgow, McInnes led the Dons to three wins at Ibrox and also defeated Rangers in a League Cup semi-final at Hampden.The Scot often linked with the Rangers job got it right again, handing Schwolow a start ahead of Scotland goalkeeper Zander Clark, and will have his fans believing investor Tony Bloom's claim that they are in a position to split the Old Firm this season.What they saidRangers head coach Russell Martin: "Three tough decisions went against us. Ours was definitely a goal and there was a hand ball before their first one."There is a lot of anxiety, a lot of difficulty managing expectation. We have so many players trying to feel their way into their Rangers career in a really difficult situation."It is not going to be an easy journey for me to win favour. It hasn't been from day one with a lot of people, but we'll keep working and make sure it does.Hearts head coach Derek McInnes: "It is an important win for us in terms of giving belief to a lot of the new lads and the lads who have been here a while who have been scarred by not winning at places at Ibrox."Everybody was making reference to our poor record here and it is good to put that to bed. It was an absolute masterclass by Lawrence Shankland up front."What's next for these teams?Rangers host the other half of Edinburgh when Hibernian visit next Saturday (17:45 BST) in the Premier Sports Cup quarter-finals, while Hearts are not in action against until hosting Falkirk the Premiership in a fortnight, with the Ibrox side visiting Livingston the following day (both 15:00).

Itâs their longest ever winless run away to the Glasgow outfit.Rangers have failed to win any of their last five league matches (D5), their longest winless run in the top-flight of Scottish football since a run of six between October and December 2005 under Alex McLeish (D4 L2).Hearts are unbeaten in their last eight league matches, winning seven of those (D1) and scoring 2+ goals in each of their last four. Itâs the Jam Tartsâ longest unbeaten run in the competition since a run of 10 between December 2023 and February 2024.Heartsâ Harry Milne has won 37 duels in the Scottish Premiership this season, the most of any player in the competition, whilst only teammate Cameron Devlin (19) has made more tackles than him this term (17).HomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCBBC emails for youAdvertise with usCopyright Â© 2025 BBC.
