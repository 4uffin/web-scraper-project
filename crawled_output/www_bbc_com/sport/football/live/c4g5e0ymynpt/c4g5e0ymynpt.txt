The French forward twice headed in from Hakan Calhanoglu corners to maintain his rich vein of form at the start of the present campaign. Thuram, 28, has now registered five goals in four games in all competitions this term and his efforts provided last season's finalists with the perfect start to the league phase of the competition as they attempt to banish memories of their thrashing in the showpiece by Paris St-Germain.
While there has been a change in the dugout, with former coach Simone Inzaghi departing in the aftermath of that final debacle, current boss Cristian Chivu fielded eight of the side that started in Munich four months ago.And he was rewarded with a fluid and confident display, with Thuram playing a starring role.The former Borussia Monchengladbach forward carried a threat all evening, which more than made up for the absence of strike partner and captain Lautaro Martinez, who was left on the bench after struggling with a back issue.Even before scoring Thuram had flashed an effort wide and had a penalty decision reversed after the video assistant referee (VAR) spotted him commit a foul on home defender Youri Baas, before the 22-year-old pulled him down in the box. Had Ajax's 20-year-old Belgian winger Mika Godts converted a gilt-edged opportunity for the hosts, just under two minutes before Thuram's opener, the match may have followed a different trajectory. But he was brilliantly denied by Inter goalkeeper Yann Sommer on the only occasion the hosts had a clear sight of goal.Inter welcome Slavia Prague to the San Siro for their next Champions League match on Tuesday, 30 September (20:00 BST), while Ajax travel to France to play Marseille on the same evening (also 20:00 BST).The Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.

Â Johnny Heitinga will become the fifth different person to both play for and manage Ajax in the European Cup/UEFA Champions League, after Johan Cruijff, Ronald Koeman, Frank de Boer and Danny Blind. All 12 of the former defenderâs appearances for Ajax in the competition came under either Koeman or Blind.Between the 2022-23 and 2024-25 seasons, Internazionale kept 20 clean sheets in the UEFA Champions League, five more than any other team. However, they conceded 13 goals in their final four games of last season, shipping at least two goals in each match.Internazionale had the oldest starting XI in terms of average age in the UEFA Champions League last season (31y 34d), with nine of their 15 starting line-ups having an average age of 30 or older.No team scored more goals from crosses than Internazionale (7) in the UEFA Champions League last season, with over a quarter of their goals in 2024-25 being netted in this fashion (27% - 7/26).Internazionaleâs Lautaro MartÃ­nez scored with 39% of his shots in the UEFA Champions League last season (nine goals from 23 attempts); the highest conversion rate of any player to attempt 15+ shots.Kenneth Taylor was both Ajaxâs top goalscorer (15) and joint-top assist provider (8) in all competitions during the 2024-25 season, while since he made his first start in major European competition in 2022-23, he is also the teamâs top scorer in Europe (8 goals).Internazionaleâs Manuel Akanji completed 90% of his passes made under high-intensity pressure in the UEFA Champions League last season (226/251); the highest success rate of any defender (min. 200 attempts).Live TextPostat 90 minutes plus 490'+4Match ends, Ajax 0, Inter Milan 2.Full Timeat 90 minutes plus 490'+4Second Half ends, Ajax 0, Inter Milan 2.Postat 90 minutes plus 390'+3Handball by Kasper Dolberg (Ajax).Postat 90 minutes plus 190'+1Foul by Davy Klaassen (Ajax).Postat 90 minutes plus 190'+1Piotr Zielinski (Inter Milan) wins a free kick in the defensive half.Postat 90 minutes90'Fourth official has announced 3 minutes of added time.Postat 90 minutes90'Attempt missed.
