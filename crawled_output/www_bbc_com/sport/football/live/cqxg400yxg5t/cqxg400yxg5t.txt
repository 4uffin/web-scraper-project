Chelsea manage Enzo Maresca, speaking to Sky Sports: "We knew that it was a tough game. The first half we struggled to find solutions, the space because they were defending very good. I think second half we were much better. It's a shame because we concede in 93m 94 minutes and we could manage better that moment."On whether the goals were avoidable: "You have to be able to avoid transitions and set pieces - they scored from transitions and set pieces. It's something we deal quite well with during the game but in the end we concede and it's a shame."On changes at half time: "Always Fofana we plan 45 minutes for him. Hato is similar. Buonanotte the last peiod has not been great for him knowing he has to go somewhere. Overall they were okay."On improving in the second half: "I think we were much much better. I think we deserve to win the game second half but it's a shame. We lost two points."On Cole Palmer: "Almost three weeks out for him, we know how it is, we know he will help us and he was very good when inside [the team]."

Fabio Carvalhoâs equaliser was the seventh goal Brentford have scored from a throw-in in the Premier League since the start of last season, at least five more than any other side.

Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca, speaking to BBC Match of the Day: "It's a shame [to concede late] but it happens. Probably we could manage that moment of the game better but in the end we concede and lose two points."We try to win every game but know we won't win every game. It's a shame because we conceded so late."On long throw-ins and how to defend them: "First of all try not to concede the throw-in. They have Kayode, Jensen, Schade and even Pinnock who are strong on throw-ins."On making three changes at half-time: "We planned to give [Wesley] Fofana 45 minutes because he's back after a long time. [Facundo] Buonanotte is the same - he needs time."

Cole Palmerâs equaliser was his 50th club goal (44 for Chelsea, six for Man City), but just his fifth as a substitute and first for Chelsea. Despite coming on in the 56th minute, Palmer had more shots (five) than any other player in the game.

Brentford manager Keith Andrews, speaking to BBC Match of the Day: "Delighted with the approach of the group, the character we constantly show. The equaliser came very late but it's what I felt we deserved from the game in terms of the application, the quality the players showed for large parts. Inevitably they're going to have periods where they're on top but I felt we dealt with a lot of that really well tonight.On Jordan Henderson's assist: "I think the detail around the way we wanted to approach it tonight was Kevin being slightly higher because of the pace. We didn't want to be camped in. Kevin's pace is just sensational and he's constantly growing in confidence. He's in a different stature now in our group, he's shown last season for large parts what a good player he is and he will be a big part."On when he decided to change formation: "Probably about 10 days ago or so. We still had a large number of players here for the international break. I felt it might be a bit of a risk for Dango depending on the minutes he played. You're always at the mercy of who comes back and how many minutes. I just felt it was the right way to go and the type of opposition tonight."On long throws: "It's been here for numerous years, it's not new to us. That was probably the last eight to 10 games of last season, big Champions League games it was quite prominent and I felt it would probably trickle down the game. I felt there's a little bit of snobbery in the game around scenarios like that, but if the big boys do it then it seems to be accepted."

Having won their last two, the Blues could win three successive league derbies for the first time since February 2024 (run of 4).After only losing two of their final 10 league games last season (W5 D3), Brentford have lost two of their first three in 2025-26 (W1). At home, though, the Bees have won three of their last four league games (L1).Chelsea have won as many as two of their first three Premier League games for only the second time in the last seven seasons (also two out of three in 2021-22).Brentford have lost three of their last five Premier League matches (W1 D1), as many as theyâd lost in their previous 14 combined (W8 D3 L3).Chelsea kept just four clean sheets in their first 26 Premier League games under Enzo Maresca but have since kept nine in their last 15, conceding only eight goals. Since the start of this clean sheet run (25 February), the Blues have the most clean sheets in the top-flight.Enzo FernÃ¡ndez has been involved in 14 goals in his last 18 appearances in all competitions for Chelsea (5 goals, 9 assists). Since the start of last season, the only Premier League player with more assists in all competitions than FernÃ¡ndez (18) is Mohamed Salah (24).Despite only playing 181 minutes in the Premier League this season, only one player has made more dribbles than Chelseaâs EstÃªvÃ£o (18). His nine against Fulham made him the youngest player on record (since 2006-07) with that many in a game for the Blues (18 years, 128 days) and youngest of any player since a 17-year-old Raheem Sterling for Liverpool vs Stoke in October 2012.Brentford forward Igor Thiago has applied 132 high intensity pressures in the opposition half this season so far, 27 more than any other player, and he also leads the way high intensity pressures in the final third of the pitch (88).HomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCBBC emails for youAdvertise with usCopyright Â© 2025 BBC.
