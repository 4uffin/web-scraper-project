The Swede's first taste of English football had ended with an opening day loss at reigning champions Chelsea. And Jeglertz was further frustrated when former England international Fran Kirby drilled past Khiara Keating in the 14th minute for the opener after Michelle Agyemang's effort had been pushed away.But City were sparked into life after the restart.Striker Khadija Shaw - who was the joint-Golden Boot winner with 12 goals last season - levelled in the 58th minute with a superb diving header, before Yui Hasegawa finished perfectly with 16 minutes left.The hosts, though, wasted several first-half opportunities.Netherlands forward Vivianne Miedema was presented with four chances alone, but could only direct one on target as Seagulls keeper Chiamaka Nnadozie superbly pushed away her deflected finish.She was replaced by Aoba Fujino, who made an immediate impact with an assist for compatriot Hasegawa's winner.Having received the ball just inside the box, Fujino showed great awareness to find Hasegawa to her left and the Japan captain slotted past Nnadozie.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Yui Hasegawa signed a new contract at Manchester City to keep her at the club until 2029Analysis: Hasegawa shows importance to Man CityAre there any more superlatives to describe Hasegawa?When City announced she had signed a contract extension on transfer deadline day, it was recognised as one of the most important signings for a WSL side. The midfield maestro was one of the best players on the pitch last Friday night at Chelsea and did not deserve to be on the losing side. But, that's football and Hasegawa is not one to let her head drop and show her disappointment - as proved in her performance against Brighton. Despite having 74 touches and seeing 50 of her 55 passes hit the target, it was not Hasegawa's most sparkling display, but she was there when it mattered most. Now playing in a role that enables her to venture further forward, Hasegawa needed one touch to control the ball before slotting beyond Nnadozie.The City players quickly swamped Hasegawa in the celebrations - perhaps showing what she means to the squad and the club. What's next for both teams?Manchester City travel to Tottenham on Friday, 19 September (19:30 BST), while Brighton host West Ham two days later (12:00 BST).The Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.
