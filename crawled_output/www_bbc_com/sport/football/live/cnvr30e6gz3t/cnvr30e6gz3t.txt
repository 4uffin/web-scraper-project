Raphinha then rifled in their fourth.Lewandowski, also a substitute, finished off Dani Olmo's pass and then dinked in a sixth - a goal given by the video assistant referee after initially being ruled offside.Barca could easily have won by more goals, with Torres also hitting the post after a Rashford cross was flicked into his path.The game was played at the 6,000-capacity Johan Cruyff Stadium, where Barca's B team usually play, because the Nou Camp is not ready yet after being redeveloped.Related topicsBarcelonaValenciaFootballComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 165Spanish La Liga Scores & FixturesSunday 14th SeptemberCelta Vigo 1 , Girona 1 at Full timeCelta VigoCelta VigoCelta Vigo11GironaGironaGironaFull timeFTLevante 2 , Real Betis 2 at Full timeLevanteLevanteLevante22BetisReal BetisReal BetisFull timeFTOsasuna 2 , Rayo Vallecano 0 at Full timeOsasunaOsasunaOsasuna20RayoRayo VallecanoRayo VallecanoFull timeFTBarcelona 6 , Valencia 0 at Full timeBarcelonaBarcelonaBarcelona60ValenciaValenciaValenciaFull timeFTView all Spanish La Liga fixturesSpanish La Liga TableOn Sunday 14th SeptemberSkip to table keyMatch Participants:Barcelona, Position 2, Points 10Valencia, Position 15, Points 4TeamPlayedWonDrawnLostGoals ForGoals AgainstGoal DifferencePointsForm, Last 6 games, Oldest first1Real Madrid440082612No ResultNo ResultWResult WinWResult WinWResult WinWResult Win2Barcelona43101331010No ResultNo ResultWResult WinWResult WinDResult DrawWResult Win3Getafe43016429No ResultNo ResultWResult WinWResult WinLResult LossWResult Win4Athletic Club43016429No ResultNo ResultWResult WinWResult WinWResult WinLResult Loss5Villarreal42118357No ResultNo ResultWResult WinWResult WinDResult DrawLResult Loss6Espanyol32105327No ResultNo ResultNo ResultWResult WinDResult DrawWResult Win7AlavÃ©s42114317No ResultNo ResultWResult WinLResult LossDResult DrawWResult Win8Elche41306426No ResultNo ResultDResult DrawDResult DrawWResult WinDResult Draw9Osasuna42023216No ResultNo ResultLResult LossWResult WinLResult LossWResult Win10Real Betis51316606No ResultDResult DrawWResult WinDResult DrawLResult LossDResult Draw11AtlÃ©tico de Madrid41215415No ResultNo ResultLResult LossDResult DrawDResult DrawWResult Win12Sevilla41127704No ResultNo ResultLResult LossLResult LossWResult WinDResult Draw13Rayo Vallecano411245-14No ResultNo ResultWResult WinLResult LossDResult DrawLResult Loss14Celta Vigo504146-24No ResultLResult LossDResult DrawDResult DrawDResult DrawDResult Draw15Valencia411248-44No ResultNo ResultDResult DrawLResult LossWResult WinLResult Loss16Real Oviedo410317-63No ResultNo ResultLResult LossLResult LossWResult WinLResult Loss17Real Sociedad402246-22No ResultNo ResultDResult DrawDResult DrawLResult LossLResult Loss18Levante401359-41No ResultNo ResultLResult LossLResult LossLResult LossDResult Draw19Mallorca301226-41No ResultNo ResultNo ResultLResult LossDResult DrawLResult Loss20Girona4013211-91No ResultNo ResultLResult LossLResult LossLResult LossDResult DrawView latest Spanish La Liga tableKeyPosition 1, 2, 3, 4 : UEFA Champions LeaguePosition 5 : UEFA Europa LeaguePosition 6 : UEFA Conference League QualifiersPosition 18, 19, 20 : RelegationLast Updated 14th September 2025 at 21:53Please Note: All times UK.
