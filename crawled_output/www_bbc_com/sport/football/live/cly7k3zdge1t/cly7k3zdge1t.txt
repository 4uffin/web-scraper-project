That's what Newcastle had sorely lacked.With Alexander Isak on strike, and no senior recognised forward available, Eddie Howe's side failed to score in two of their opening three games of the campaign, picking up just a couple of points in the process.Enter Woltemade.Newcastle would have ideally liked to ease Woltemade in, as the German had never played outside of his homeland before. The club even brought in a proven Premier League forward in Yoane Wissa on deadline day to help share the burden following Isak's British record move to Liverpool.But Wissa suffered a knee injury on international duty with DR Congo, so head coach Howe had little option but to throw Woltemade in from the off against Wolves â just a few days after he trained with his new team-mates for the first time.He quickly made an impact.Woltemade is not a traditional target man â the 6ft 6in is a technician capable of wriggling out of tight spaces and linking play â but the debutant opened his account with a classic number nine's goal.Murphy, who laid on so many goals for Isak last season, delivered a ball into the box, and the new arrival provided the scoring header.It was the cue for the home support to break out into a chant of: "Woltemade, Woltemade, ole, ole, ole."And they were later on their feet to give him a standing ovation after he was replaced by William Osula midway through the second half.Forwards are revered in these parts and it looks as if Woltemade has already been embraced by Newcastle fans.To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.This video can not be playedMedia caption, Howe pleased with debut winner for 'clever' WoltemedeWolves analysis: Wait for a point goes onWolves made history on Saturday - but not for the right reasons.They have now lost each of their opening four games of a league campaign for the first time in their history. For context, this is the club's 127th season in the Football League or Premier League.The visitors, in truth, never looked like getting back into this game after going behind.Yet they had made a bright start.Indeed the game had just got under way when Wolves went long and Rodrigo Gomes' effort was pushed behind by Pope. From the resulting corner, Hwang's half-volley forced Pope into a fine stop.It gave the travelling support up in the gods real encouragement. In fact, at one point, the away end felt assured enough to ask Geordies where was their "famous atmosphere".Wolves certainly caused Newcastle problems with their pace in behind before the hosts took the lead. Gomes fired wide from close range while Newcastle needed Fabian Schar to make a last-ditch tackle to prevent Tolu Arokodare from tapping home at the back post on his debut.However, crucially, Wolves did not grab that opener.How the return of talisman Jorgen Stand Larsen will be welcomed after the striker missed this game against his one-time suitors with an Achilles injury.Wolves certainly need a boost.To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.This video can not be playedMedia caption, Yellow cards 'spoiled' Wolves' game - PereiraWhat next for these teams?Newcastle host Barcelona at St James' Park in the club's Champions League opener on Thursday, 18 September.Wolves welcome Leeds United to Molineux on Saturday, 20 September.The Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.

their lowest against any side theyâve faced at least 20 times in the competition.Wolverhampton Wanderers have won just one of their last 22 away top-flight visits to Newcastle (D7 L14), winning 2-1 in December 2018 under Nuno EspÃ­rito Santo. In 43 away games at the Magpies in the top division, Wolves have just two clean sheets, with those coming in 1899 and 1974.Newcastle have scored in all 20 Premier League games against Wolves â only Arsenal vs West Brom (26) and Arsenal vs Wolves (22) have played more games against one opponent and scored in each game in the competitionâs history.Newcastle United are winless in five Premier League games (D2 L3), last going six without a win in September 2022. The Magpies have lost both of their last two league games at St. Jamesâ Park, last losing three in a row in February 2021.Wolves have lost all three of their Premier League games this season, and could lose each of their opening four games of a league campaign for the very first time in their history, with this their 127th season in the Football League/Premier League.Despite winning none of their first three Premier League matches so far this season (D2 L1), Newcastle have faced the fewest shots of any side (18). Itâs the fewest faced by a side in their first three games since 2021-22 (Man City, 15).Since winning six Premier League games in a row in March and April, Wolves have picked up just one point in seven games (D1 L6), the first side in top-flight history to produce such a run, while the last team to follow up a six-game winning streak with seven winless games was Liverpool in the 2002-03 season (won seven in a row, then 11 winless, D5 L6).Wolverhampton Wanderers have spent 81.5% of their Premier League matches losing so far this season, with only one other side spending more than 50% in a losing position (Aston Villa, 57.1%). The second highest percentage a side has spent in one game state in 2025-26 is Newcastle when drawing (79.6%).New Wolves forward Tolu Arokodare was the joint leading scorer in the Belgian Pro League in the 2024-25 campaign with 21 goals, also having the most shots in the division (158). However, according to his xG, he was expected to score 28.6 goals, an underperformance of 7.6 which was the biggest in the division.Nick Woltemade will be the fourth German player to play in the Premier League for Newcastle United, along with Dietmar Hamann, Loris Karius and Malick Thiaw. He scored five goals in his final seven appearances for Stuttgart in all competitions, and only eight Bundesliga players scored more goals in all competitions in 2024-25 than Woltemade (17).Live TextPostat 90 minutes plus 790'+7Match ends, Newcastle United 1, Wolverhampton Wanderers 0.Full Timeat 90 minutes plus 790'+7Second Half ends, Newcastle United 1, Wolverhampton Wanderers 0.Postat 90 minutes plus 790'+7Attempt blocked.
