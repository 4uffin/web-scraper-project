Brentford boss Keith Andrews has confirmed a clean bill of health ahead of their fixture against Fulham: "A couple of players rested on Tuesday, for the right reasons, just to utilise the squad, make sure they were okay, so we are in a pretty good place on that front. No issues at all.

Some team news to bring you from Brentford manager Keith Andrews now and that may well be us for the day. I, like many West Ham fans I reckon, need a drink.

Our central defenders are far too slow and unreliable, just you watch the way Mateta will easily bully our back four on Saturday! Fans see it week in and out... why can't Potter?David, WithamSimply the fact is West Ham doesn't have enough quality. Goalkeeper is scared to come off his line and Kilman is not good enough and Ward-Prowse is just a Table football player going sideways all the time.Paul, Norwich

Image source, Getty ImagesLeeds United boss Daniel Farke has doubled down on his stance regarding youngster Harry Gray, stressing the need for patience and proper progression before the teenager can be considered for regular first-team action:"I have said everything what I have to say about him in my last press conference, and I won't speak with him until we see him on the grass. And nothing has changed. Also, I wouldn't compare his situation with someone who comes in there when the team is 4-0 or 5-0 up and gets his debut and everyone is happy, and then you don't see him for a while anymore. "When I came here to Leeds, I had Archie Gray, and we replaced my big leader, legend and vice captain Luke Ailing with a 17-year-old, and it was not easy. Last year I gave Mateo Joseph his debut and played him ahead of Patrick Bamford and Golden Boot winner Joe Piroe, and it was not easy in the dressing room. "I've said everything about Harry that's needed. He needs training sessions with the first team to get used to the proper physicality of men's football in the Premier League. He needs game time in the U21s, in order to sustain his rhythm, and what he needs most is time and peace to develop and grow."

Hammers fans are entitled to expect better given the club have
spent over Â£250m in the last two summer transfer windows. Half of that outlay has
come under Potter, who has won just six of his 22 league matches. That includes
only two home wins, the most recent of which was in February.Another issue likely to alarm the West Ham board is
the increased competitiveness of the newly promoted sides. In each of the
previous two seasons, the newcomers went straight back down without much of a
fight, with 27 points theoretically enough to guarantee safety in both
campaigns.The early indications are Sunderland, Burnley and
Leeds will fare better this term. That may take away a bit of a comfort blanket
for any established Premier League teams struggling at the wrong end of the
table â and could leave Potterâs position in jeopardy unless result improve
soon.Image source, Getty Images

An incredibly haphazard transfer policy, seemingly based "on how many can we buy for a given price?". I suspect Potter has less say in who turns up than most managers do, and he isn't strong enough to assert himself, so he's likely to be gone before Xmas.Robert, London

The problem with Potter's assessment here is similar to the problem with Amorim. Honesty is brilliant, we all want it. But you are offering no idea or hopes to how you're going to solve these glaring issues you keep talking about. "We must develop" is a nothing statement without plans.Harry, Manchester

Image source, Getty ImagesLeeds boss Daniel Farke also addressed his side's inability to score goals, as they have only once in four Premier League games: "Obviously, to stay calm and to see the bigger picture. We are a newly promoted and it is obviously normal that we won't take the league by storm. First step is to be rock solid at the back and be difficult to beat, and that's what we are. "Quite often, results dominate the narrative, but we have played a very good last away to Fulham. Normally, if this unbelievable, unlucky own goal doesn't happen, then the focus would have been on the third clean sheet and already at five points and being difficult to beat, then they wouldn't speak much about our offence."I am pretty happy that we are so rock solid in most of the periods. This is always the key as a newly promoted side to give you a chance of survival."

Very defeatist to claim we canât compete with Spurs. They fielded a second string thinking ahead to their midweek game, and we gifted them two of their goals. That is âdidnâtâ compete, not âcanâtâ compete.Daniel, LondonIâve always liked Potter but he seems to have lost the plot. Making out weâre a tiny team in a big league trying our best and claiming weâre playing well when we conceded 8 goals in two home games! Utter nonsense.David, Cotswolds

Leeds United boss Daniel Farke on team news: "We have a few doubts for this game. Dan James is a major doubt and is still struggling a bit. Also, Wilfried Gnonto is struggling with calf problems. "Apart from that, everyone is in a good place. He (Lucas Perri) is also out for this game and in the middle of next week, we will have a clearer picture on how long he will be out for."

If West Ham thought they were back on track after beating
Nottingham Forest prior to the international break, Saturdayâs 3-0 defeat by
Tottenham proved a sobering reality check, and a reminder of the mounting problems
facing boss Graham Potter. The most pressing is their leaky backline. They
have already conceded a league-high 11 goals, including a remarkable six from
corners. That is over twice as many as any other side, with over a third of all
Premier League goals scored from corners this season ending in the Hammersâ
net.Equally as crucial, but perhaps harder to solve, is
rediscovering a connection with the fanbase. This will be West Hamâs third
consecutive home game against London opposition and each of the previous two â
against Spurs and Chelsea â saw supporters streaming out long before the final
whistle with defeat by then inevitable.

No, not the films. West Ham United manager Graham Potter has been speaking to the media this afternoon in his pre-Crystal Palace news conference. Lots to go at from it but here are the top lines:
Team news as Aaron Wan-Bissaka confirmed out
Potter gave his response to the club statement that was put out on Wednesday evening
He said the team "have to be perfect" to get results against the likes of Tottenham Hotspur and Chelsea and also alluded to his side's weakness at set-pieces

That's all from Graham Potter.We'll recap that shortly before diving into Leeds United manager Daniel Farke.Some stark lines from the Hammers boss. Like David pointed out here - a very interesting way of going about things by claiming you can't compete with a couple of your biggest rivals...Thoughts on that, Hammers fans? Is he just being honest? Or is he miles off it with that?

Finally, West Ham boss Graham Potter was asked about young midfielder Freddie Potts: "I think Freddie has had a really positive journey so far with the academy and with the loans and it is his first season back with the first team."In pre-season I think he did well but he is someone that we know his qualities and he has to work hard and wait for his opportunity. "The Premier League is a competitive league so as much as we want to integrate young players - if you at my previous records its something I'm proud of - but at the same time you have to do it at the right time for the club, team and individual."

Potter is doing himself no favours here by making out like we should be expecting to lose to the likes of Chelsea and Tottenham because they are just better than us. Itâs nonsense, youâve lost before you even go on the pitch if thatâs your attitude.David, Cotswolds

FA Cup winners and in to Europe and I think they have done a fantastic job in terms of how they've built that project."Under the coach and under the board they have worked together. They have lots of good players who clearly know what they are doing in out and of possession, we have to focus on ourselves and see how we can make it a problem for them as well."
