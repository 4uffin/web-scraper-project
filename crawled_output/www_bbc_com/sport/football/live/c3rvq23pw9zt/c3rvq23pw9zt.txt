It's been a long day in the Scottish Premiership and that was an absolute barnstormer of a game to finish on.Hearts sit top of the table after an excellent 2-0 win at Rangers, who are slumped in 10th place.Aberdeen are also without a win - or a goal - after a drab draw at home to Livingston, while Motherwell shared the points for a fifth successive time away to Dundee.St Mirren are celebrating their first league victory after getting the better of Falkirk.There's still one game to come on Sunday, with champions Celtic visiting Kilmarnock.Make sure you join us for that one.

Hibs head coach David Gray tells Premier Sports: âWe got a point out of a game where our character was tested."Our defence was poor. The positive I can take is that we came back after finding ourselves 3-1 down."I told the players we gave them far too many chances and that we were miles off it today."We relied on our goalkeeper heavily, second half."For us, being at home, we werenât good enough defensively, and a lot of that was down to Dundee United being good too, but we need to be better defensively."I credit the players with their desire to go and get back into the game, but it feels like we're chasing too much."On the penalty and the incorrect VAR call in the previous game, Gray adds: "The whole point of VAR is to get decisions rightâ¦ Itâs all about accountability, and the officials coming out [to discuss decisions] is important that there is that accountability."Image source, SNS

Dundee United manager Jim Goodwin tells Premier Sports: "Firstly, I thought it was a fantastic game, a fantastic advert for the Scottish Premiership, two teams going at it, a lot of goalmouth action, and two keepers making great saves."Itâs a really harsh rule (for the penalty), Iâd hate to be a defender these days or a referee making those decisions."From our perspective, itâs two points dropped."Weâve made a couple of mistakes and a really difficult penalty [is given against us], and Sevelj gets a red card, and will now miss the next game for us. Heâs a really important player for us."I don't know what Sevelj is meant to do. I think it's harsh."I thought it was a brilliant game of football and I felt we should have won. All three goals we scored were really well-worked."Image source, SNSImage caption, Dundee United led 1-0 and 3-1 at Easter Road

Jim Goodwin is doing his Premier Sports interview and is maybe suggesting Hibs were given a penalty after being denied an absolute stonewaller against St Mirren last time - and the fallout from the subsequent VAR review.Cheeky? Or does he have a point?

Hibs' next outing is away to Rangers in the Premier Sports Cup.If they tighten up in defence and still carry anywhere near the same threat in attack, then they will fancy making it an Edinburgh double at Ibrox.

Hibs had 27 efforts on goal, with 12 on target. United weren't far behind with nine on target from 13 attempts.Both sides really went for it. There will be a lot of tired legs in the dressing rooms.

The points are shared in a thriller.Hibs will be happy to have come back from two goals down but that's three home games without a win.With one win, the Edinburgh side stay third as Dundee United drop one place to fifth in a very congested table.
