You tell me," said Juventus boss Igor Tudor."Joking aside, it's difficult to explain. In football, it's never over, and we did well to believe in ourselves until the end."Dortmund sporting director Sebastian Kehl added: "Two teams played outstandingly well in the second half. It went back and forth, it was open, and fantastic for the spectators."Overall, I'm actually satisfied with the team's performance, even if it sounds a bit skewed after the final minutes."How an extraordinary second half unfoldedKarim Adeyemi gave Dortmund the opener when he expertly shifted the ball on the edge of the box and guided it into the far corner.Dortmund improved considerably in front of goal, but, 11 minutes later, a moment of Juventus magic from Kenan Yildiz ended with the Turkey international bending a wonderful effort into the far top corner from distance.Less than two minutes passed before Dortmund were again in front, with Felix Nmecha delivering another sublime finish when he curled a first-time effort into the top corner.But there were always further twists around the corner, and Vlahovic slotted home when one-on-one less than two minutes later to level again.Having lost their advantage twice, Dortmund seized the lead again when Yan Couto, charging towards the Juve box, fired a low drive inside the near post, narrowly past the outstretched hand of Michele di Gregorio.Ramy Bensebaini doubled Dortmund's lead from the penalty spot after former England Under-21 international Kelly handled the ball in his box.But Vlahovic fired a late effort in off the woodwork before setting up ex-Bristol City and Bournemouth defender Kelly to seal a late draw.Related topicsFootballComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 274UEFA Champions League Scores & FixturesTuesday 16th SeptemberAthletic Club 0 , Arsenal 2 at Full timeAthleticAthletic ClubAthletic Club02ArsenalArsenalArsenalFull timeFTPSV 1 , Union Saint-Gilloise 3 at Full timePSVPSVPSV13R.

This includes a 2-1 defeat at Bologna last season, which was the only victory the RossoblÃ¹ managed in eight games during the league phase.Juventus have never lost when playing their opening game of a European Cup/UEFA Champions League campaign at home, winning 11 and drawing three of the 14 such matches. They won 3-1 against PSV to begin the previous edition.Borussia Dortmund have won their opening game in three of the last four UEFA Champions League campaigns, only failing to do so against Paris SG in the 2023-24 season (2-0 defeat).Igor Tudor is set to take charge of Juventus in the UEFA Champions League in 2025-26, which would see him become the fourth individual to both play for and manage the Old Lady in the competition, after Ciro Ferrara, Antonio Conte and Andrea Pirlo.Borussia Dortmund were only behind for 13.2% of their total match time in the UEFA Champions League last season; only runners-up Internazionale (6.6%) trailed for a lower proportion of their games.Borussia Dortmund scored more goals following a high turnover (5) than any other team in the UEFA Champions League last season, while they also converted the highest percentage of their shot-ending high turnovers into goals (24% - 5/21).Borussia Dortmund netted ten goals from the 75th minute onwards in the UEFA Champions League last season; the most of any team (excluding extra time). Striker Serhou Guirassy either scored (4) or assisted (1) five of those 10 late goals.Juventus striker Jonathan David was directly involved in nine goals in 10 UEFA Champions League appearances in 2024-25 (seven goals, two assists). Among players with 500+ minutes played, only three individuals had a better minutes per goal involvement ratio than the Canadian (83): Raphinha (58), Serhou Guirassy (64) and Charles De Ketelaere (78).Serhou Guirassy scored 13 goals in 14 appearances for Borussia Dortmund in the UEFA Champions League last season; the most ever by an African player in a single European Cup/UCL campaign.Live TextPostat 90 minutes plus 890'+8Match ends, Juventus 4, Borussia Dortmund 4.Full Timeat 90 minutes plus 890'+8Second Half ends, Juventus 4, Borussia Dortmund 4.Goal!at 90 minutes plus 690'+6Goal!
