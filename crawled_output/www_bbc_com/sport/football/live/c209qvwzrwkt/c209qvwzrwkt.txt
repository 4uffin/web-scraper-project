West Ham boss Rehanne Skinner speaking to Sky Sports: "For 65 minutes, I think we were really effective. In the first half, we made it really difficult for Arsenal and they struggled to break our game down. I thought our pressing strategy was good for 65 minutes, we were really aggressive on the front foot and made lots of turnovers. We didn't create as many chances as we would've liked from those turnovers, but that's something we need to look at."When we conceded the third goal, at that point we have to be brave. I'm asking the players to be brave in the way we play. We could've sat in but we didn't want to and we wanted to keep trying to get something out of the game, you could see that from the substitutions."I would rather us be positive about the way we're trying to play than just sit in and take a 3-1 defeat. The goals that came late on were because we adjusted our shape and we were trying to get something out of the game."

Brighton boss Dario Vidosic speaking to Sky Sports: "From the kick off we went all the way back [to the keeper] and that sort of set the tone for the whole half. We still had a couple of opportunities but they had a lot more."If we give the ball away then we are continuously caught in transition and then we are defending. It is not just a defensive issue, it is a collective issue. In the second half we couldn't put two passes together - whether it's the turnaround, they had seven days, we had five days, I don't know. We need to learn to not let the result go."First half was good and there were some moments that we had a bit better control and had possession in their half. We had an opportunity five on four and again the final pass and decision making was wrong. Over the two games that final third is letting us down."On Fran Kirby coming off at half time: "That was fitness. She felt something and she just couldn't carry on so we had to make the substitution. We will need a little time to assess and we will see in the next few days."

Arsenal boss Renee Slegers speaking to Sky Sports: "It was a hard game. We were prepared for a hard game but they came out differently. This ground is really hard to go to because they are a very disciplined team and their intensity was really high across 90 minutes. We had to overcome going 1-0 down again, but we were very calm and composed which allowed us to come back into the game."On what was changed at half-time: "We were happy with our out of possession detail but we made a couple of tweaks in possession. We wanted to beat their first press because they were really aggressive every time we passed back or sideways, so we wanted to find solutions there. We also wanted to build some longer attacks in the final third. We had to manage the game and create some rhythm."On the team mentality: "There was already a strong foundation. My role shifted from assistant coach to interim coach to head coach, so my advantage was already knowing the group. The players have been a big part of what we're building."

Alessia Russo was the star of the show for Arsenal. Her double may have come late but she was a danger throughout. That's now nine goals scored in just two games for the visitors. They have made a flying start to the season.The scoreline may be big but West Ham did well for long periods of that match and can take heart from that.

Arsenal forward Alessia Russo speaking to Sky Sports: "It was a great performance. We probably didn't start exactly how we wanted to, but sometimes that happens when you come away from home to a tough ground like West Ham. We turned it around, especially in the second half, and were clinical with our chances. Frida [Maanum]'s goal changed the momentum and we pushed on from there."On keeping up her energy levels after a busy summer: "I'm feeling good. I had a lot of games over the summer, I was always kind of ticking over, so I took some rest and then went straight back into pre-season. We have been working really hard so I'm just ready for this season."On her goals: "It was a great cutback from Olivia [Smith]. I just touched and hit it, we practice that so much in training and I probably don't do it enough at times. I just went for it. Penalties are something you always have to practice as athletes, so whenever that moment comes I'm happy to step up."On their unbeaten start to the season: "The last two games have shown how much of a massive squad we've got. We have got players that can come in, players that can start and players that can finish - all are full of talent. We want to be playing in a team full of amazing players."

There was no stress.On what he changed for second half: "We talked about keeping doing the things we are doing. I was convinced if we don't get stressed, we would hurry up but don't rush it.""We have a great squad. We have many good players that started the game and coming on at the end of the game also. We can play different ways with the qualities, they are giving us something different."On Yui Hasegawa: "She is an amazing player. She is so important for this team. I am happy for her."On confidence going forward: "If you create a lot of scoring changes and win, the confidence is growing. We believe if we keep doing these things, we need to adjust a couple of things still. But in general a lot of things are building from this game to give us confidence."

Manchester City's Kerstin Casparij talking to Sky Sports on what changed at half-time: "We were doing alright to be fair. We changed our press a little bit. We were able to get a bit wider and a bit higher so we were able to break the line. Just a few little tweaks."I'm looking forward to getting loads of assists. That's my aim for this year. Hopefully I can work on that tally. I work a lot with Bunny and Hempo to give good deliveries."On getting their first win: "We lost last week but there were a lot of positives. We work on the positives, do a few tweaks and we are happy to come away with a win for our home fans."

A very dominant performance. A very well-taken penalty from Alessia Russo. A very definite penalty in the first place.That was right in the corner! Megan Walsh had no chance even though she guessed it was going there. But, once it's that far away from you, there's no chance.
