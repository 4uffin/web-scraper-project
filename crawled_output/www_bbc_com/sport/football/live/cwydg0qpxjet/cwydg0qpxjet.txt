Image source, Getty ImagesRichard: Who should we be looking to replace Florian Wirtz with, if we already have Antoine Semenyo? I think Chelsea offer some great midfield options. If you can find the money for Cole Palmer then he is obviously their best asset but Enzo Fernandez and Pedro Neto are looking sharp too.

Image source, Getty ImagesMari: Got three of my back four â Marc Guehi, Daniel MuÃ±oz, and James Tarkowski but struggling to decide between Pedro Porro and Dan Burn. I can't call it - who should I pick to complete my back line?There is little splitting Burn and Pedro Porro and both after playing in the Champions League this week and with a difficult away trips this weekend are surely likely to concede. I would therefore consider who is most likely to pick up additional points? Pedro Porro has the greater assist threat but Burn offers higher goal threat and defcon potential.
Pedro Porro edges it for me but this is a decision I think you should make yourself. Itâs a 50/50.

Image source, Getty ImagesBob: Hi Gianni, how long do I persist with Ollie Watkins, Florian Wirtz and Bruno Fernandes? Wildcard tonight or give them one last week to prove theyâre not useless? It feels Wirtz is starting to settle perhaps. Hi Bob, I do prefer the wildcard next week than this week, especially knowing Man City and Arsenal would both feature heavily on wildcard and with them facing each other this week, I would want to avoid that.Itâs been super frustrating owning Watkins and Wirtz but you could give them one last week knowing they have good fixtures.

Image source, Getty ImagesMatthew: Iâm not sure who to pick as my captain between Erling Haaland and Hugo Ekitike or if playing the free hit chip is the play?Ekitike has the better fixtures but a start isnât guaranteed and 90 minutes is very unlikely therefore, I would back 90-minute man Haaland. Every week there are advantages to using a free hit but personally I donât love the upside that it offers this week with very few fixtures standing out where a haul is likely but, of course, it's team dependent.Ideally youâre looking for weeks where there are a handful of the top teams playing those at the bottom of the league.

Image source, Getty ImagesMo: Hi Gianni, should I transfer Ollie Watkins out this week? I need to get Erling Haaland but on a wildcard. Hi Mo, this one is so tricky as we can't keep giving Watkins "one more week" and if youâre on wildcard it's even easier to offload. Youâre absolutely right, you do need Haaland if youâre on wildcard and if going without Watkins is your only easy route to owning the Norwegian then you should be selling him guilt free. Even if Villa do win and Watkins does score, I canât see him getting more than one goal and the damage wonât be too brutal for sellers.

Image source, Getty ImagesBarry: I don't own Mohamed Salah this week and don't want to captain Cole Palmer against the team I support (Man Utd, unfortunately). Who is the next best captain? Hi Barry, do you own Antoine Semenyo? If so thatâs where I would go. Bournemouth look really sharp and unlike Newcastle, have had a full week on the training ground.

Image source, Getty ImagesFranek: Afternoon, Gianni. I come to you with the age-old question: Mo Salah or Erling Haaland? This one feels impossible to answer at the moment. This week I prefer Salah, next week I will prefer Haaland (Burnley at home) and I wonder if the answer is actually to own both. Ahead of Gameweek 6, I plan to have both in my team and with enough good budget players this year I think itâs a legit option. Owning both however could block moves for players that I like and want to own long term like Cole Palmer, Viktor Gyokeres and Arsenal defenders so whilst I think both works now, in might not look optimal in a monthâs time. The wildcard button can always be your get out of jail free card if things go wrong though right?

Image source, Getty ImagesStephen: I believe Alexander Isak will outscore Hugo Ekitike, who I have now, over the season but should I swap them before this weekend or wait? I have the money. Arne Slot didnât give much away in his presser this morning and I expect the two forwards will split minutes in the derby. Predicting which one gets the start and a likely 60-75 minutes is very difficult. I think I would make the move in the next few weeks but this week I would roll the dice with Ekitike knowing he didnât start in the week and then save the transfer.

Image source, Getty ImagesAndrew: Gianni - what separates the decent FPL managers from the good FPL managers from the best FPL managers? Thatâs the million dollar question but to me, the very best FPL managers are those that consistently hit good ranks. In a game with over 10 million managers, I have always seen the Top 1% and therefore the Top 100k as a successful season.
Picking the right captain more often that not, planning ahead to bring in players with good fixture swings, reacting to data and eye test scouting all play a role in having a good season, as well as having luck on your side of course.

Despite being burned by him last time out, we still can't find a place for Erling Haaland - fresh from two Manchester derby goals - in the FPL team of the week.Like most weeks, it is a choice between the two big guns - Haaland and Mohamed Salah.While Liverpool forward Salah has eight goals in 11 games against opponents Everton, Haaland faces an Arsenal defence that has yet to concede from open play. It feels like a simple decision.What you do long term with those two assets is a different question, and FPL expert Gianni Buttice and the team from the FPL Podcast from BBC Sport will be debating that in Friday morning's Talking Point article. Keep an eye out for that one.Team cost: Â£97mThe team of the week is selected based on current FPL prices to fit within a Â£100m budget, as if you were playing a Free Hit.

Image source, Getty ImagesChris: Is captaining a defender viable this week? The fixtures don't look like they have high-scoring potential. For example, Maxence Lacroix could have a base of four points with Defcon, eight with clean sheet and 14 with a goal from a corner, which West Ham have been poor at defending. Plus bonus! We speak about a player's ceiling when considering captaincy but we should also consider their floor now as you rightly point out Chris, because Defcon has changed the game. Players like Lacroix hit the additional two Defcon points more often than not and I understand why you would consider him.
There are very few standout fixtures to chase this week but I always prefer to captain the attacker and can probably count on one hand the amount of times Iâve captained a defender in over 10 years of playing. Mo Salah, Antoine Semenyo, Erling Haaland and Cole Palmer are my favourite options this week.

Image source, Getty ImagesJack: Hi Gianni, who would be your best choice FPL replacements this week for Murillo? Hi Jack, I too own Murillo and have been shopping for his replacement all week. I think we have two stand out options: Gabriel or Marcos Senesi.
If you have the money in the bank, move to an Arsenal defender for a long-term play. Theyâre clearly the best defence in the league and their fixtures look great from Gameweek 7. Meanwhile Bournemouthâs Senesi has picked up the additional two defensive contribution points in all four of his games â one of only two defenders (along with James Tarkowski) to hit four from four.
