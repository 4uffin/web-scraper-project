Eric Garcia stabbed in after Escandell tipped Ferran Torres' swivel volley on to the post, and 14 minutes later, substitutes combined as Lewandowski met De Jong's inswinging cross at its peak with a flicked header that kissed the crossbar on its way in.In the final moments Araujo headed home from a Rashford corner - the Englishman's third assist in three league games - to secure the win.Oviedo's second goal of the season will be of little consolation, as they remain in the relegation zone with just three points after six games.Barcelona remain second and close the gap between themselves and league leaders Real Madrid to two points.The Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.
