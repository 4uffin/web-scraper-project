Spurs captain Cristian Romero on facing former Spurs defender and fellow Argentine Juan Foyth: "I know him really well. We played together in the U20s and U23s. We managed to spend time together in the national team. He is a great guy and a top player. He was here as well so it will be a special game for him."On performances so far under Thomas Frank: "We always focus on our jobs and our work. We have a great manager. We have a great defensive coach. We always want to imporve. If you take Bournemouth out, we've done well. We do our best no matter who we are playing against. It is always about increasing our performance and looking to improve."On signing an extended contract: "I never said I wanted to leave the club. Nothing came from me in that effect. It is important what the manager and president say. I am very happy here, it is like a family. I like the manager. I like the way we work, the way we train. Always things can improve but I think everyone here at all levels are taking the right steps to improve. I am very happy here."Image source, Getty Images

I know it'll be special when we have that Champions League anthem playing."Now it's preparation, there's a few more cameras, but it's business as usual. When we all go out onto the pitch tomorrow then it'll be special."I believe I have a fantastic squad and we would like to go as far as possible. I think the most important thing is that it's one game at a time. Villarreal are a very good team, I've been very impressed when I've studied them, but we'll do everything we can to get a good start. It's going to be a good challenge."

After a near perfect start under Frank, and with a favourable CL draw, the real test starts tomorrow. Villareal is the first of six games in 18 days and I'm not convinced we have the depth. Quarters would be a huge achievement this season (provided we don't tank the league!)JoeyI don't think any Spurs fan is thinking we could win it, but pretty sure Frank will get us through to the knockouts. Strengthen the squad again in January then who knows.BenGiven the opposition we have been drawn against we will qualify from the league stage. Don't see us being strong enough to go all the way, but made the final in 2019 when clearly not the best, so with the luck of the draw and a few lucky breaks, who knows!Pete

We have been given reasonably good fixtures in the group so you would hope we get past that stage either via top eight or play-off. Maybe quarter finals?SamWhile it's a shame not to draw a really big team at home, the draw is really favourable for Spurs. We should be aiming to get through in the top eight and push on in other competitions to build on the good feeling of last year's trophy success.HarryWith the home games and then Bodo/Glimt, 12 points should be relatively easily achievable and the knockouts await the Spurs. Depending on the draw, that'd likely be the end of the line though.Matt
