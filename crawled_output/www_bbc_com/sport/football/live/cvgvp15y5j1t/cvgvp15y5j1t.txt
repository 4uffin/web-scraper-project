title with an emphatic win against Atalanta.Having become European champions for the first time with a 5-0 thumping of Inter Milan in May's final, they dominated against another Serie A side at the Parc des Princes.Captain Marquinhos opened the scoring in only the third minute, side-footing into the net following Fabian Ruiz's low cross from the left.PSG had plenty of chances, but Nuno Mendes shot just wide, teenager Senny Mayulu had an effort deflected over and Atalanta goalkeeper Marco Carnesecchi made excellent saves to deny Bradley Barcola and Achraf Haikimi.But a second goal was always coming and the hosts doubled their advantage in style in the 39th minute thanks to Khvicha Kvaratskhelia's solo goal that saw him run at the visiting defence before firing home from 18 yards.PSG boss Luis Enrique was watching the first half from high up in the stands to get a better view tactically and his side should have made it 3-0 when they were awarded a penalty after Marquinhos was fouled by Yunus Musah.However, with Ousmane Dembele and Desire Doue both missing because of injury, Barcola took the spot-kick only to see his weak and central effort easily saved by Carnesecchi.Nevertheless, PSG did get their third five minutes into the second half with Mendes firing past the Atalanta keeper at his near post from a tight angle.The Italian side, managed by former Southampton boss Ivan Juric, rarely tested home goalkeeper Lucas Chevalier and conceded a fourth goal in added time when Raoul Bellanova's poor backpass was intercepted by Goncalo Ramos with the substitute calmly finishing.PSG's next Champions League games see them visit Barcelona and Bayer Leverkusen in October, before home matches against Bayern Munich and Tottenham in November.Atalanta will be looking to beat Club Brugge at home in their next match in the competition on Tuesday, 30 September.Related topicsParis St-GermainEuropean FootballAtalantaUEFA Champions LeagueFootballMore on

Indeed, the French sideâs last game in the UEFA Champions League was a 5-0 victory over Internazionale in last seasonâs final â the biggest ever margin of victory in a European Cup/Champions League showpiece.Only one of the last 30 holders of the UEFA Champions League have lost their opening match in the following campaign (W19 D10), with Liverpool losing away to Napoli in the 2019-20 edition (0-2).Paris SG boss Luis Enrique has won 64.5% of his games as a manager in the UEFA Champions League (40/62), with this the highest win percentage of any individual with 50+ matches overseen.Atalantaâs current boss, Ivan Juric, has never previously managed in the UEFA Champions League. Indeed, his only experience as a coach in major European competition (excluding qualifiers) came in last seasonâs UEFA Europa League, overseeing four games in charge of Roma (W1 D2 L1).Only Barcelona (+15) had a better goal difference than Atalanta in the league phase of the 2024-25 UEFA Champions League (+14 â 20 goals scored, 6 conceded).In the league phase of the 2024-25 UEFA Champions League, Paris SGâs Lucas Chevalier ranked fourth among all goalkeepers for goals prevented, based on the xG of shots on target faced (+3.77 â 10 goals conceded from 13.77 xG on target). Indeed, this was the best differential of any goalkeeper aged under 30 during the league phase.Charles De Ketelaere was directly involved in nine goals in 10 UEFA Champions League appearances for Atalanta last season (4 goals, 5 assists). This was the most in a single edition by a Belgian player, overtaking Kevin De Bruyneâs total of eight in 2022-23 (2 goals, 6 assists).Paris SGâs Achraf Hakimi created 36 chances from open play in the UEFA Champions League last season; the most by a defender in a single edition of the competition on record (since 2003-04).Atalantaâs Davide Zappacosta led all players for both successful crosses (16) and chances created from crosses (9) â both from open play â in the UEFA Champions League last season. Indeed, his five assists were also the joint-most by a defender, along with Paris SGâs Achraf Hakimi.Live TextPostat 90 minutes plus 490'+4Match ends, Paris Saint Germain 4, Atalanta 0.Full Timeat 90 minutes plus 490'+4Second Half ends, Paris Saint Germain 4, Atalanta 0.Postat 90 minutes plus 390'+3Attempt saved.
