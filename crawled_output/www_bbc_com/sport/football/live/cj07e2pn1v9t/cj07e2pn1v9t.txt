Newcastle may be struggling to score goals in the Premier League this season following the departure of Alexander Isak to Liverpool but their defence has been rock solid.
Eddie Howeâs side have kept a league-high four clean sheets in five matches. The Magpies have only conceded three goals in the league so far, all of which came in the loss to Liverpool when the visitors scored twice after Newcastle had gone down to 10 men.
Newcastle also have the lowest expected goals tally against (2.6) of any Premier League team so far this season, have faced the fewest shots (37) and are yet to make an error leading to a goal.
Their almost flawless defence has been particularly useful on the road, earning three points in goalless draws at Aston Villa, Leeds and Bournemouth.
Should Newcastleâs attack start to click in conjunction with their defensive solidity, the Magpies should start to climb the Premier League table.

Newcastle United face Bradford City in the League Cup tonight â the competition they won to end their 70-year domestic trophy drought in March â having so far struggled to score goals this season.
The overriding factor has been the protracted departure of Alexander Isak, who scored the winning goal in the EFL Cup final six months ago â ironically against Liverpool, the club he would go on to join in acrimonious circumstances for a British record fee. Isak scored 23 goals and provided six assists in last season's Premier League, meaning he was directly involved in more than 40% of Newcastleâs total league goals, scoring 33.85% of them.
Newcastle replaced Isak with the signings of Brentford forward Yoane Wissa and Stuttgart striker Nick Woltemade but Wissa was injured on international duty with DR Congo and will not feature for at least several weeks. Woltemade scored on debut in the 1-0 win against Wolves but Anthony Gordon was preferred as a false nine to start the Champions League defeat against Barcelona.
Newcastleâs tally of three goals after five games is their third fewest at this stage of a Premier League season behind 2005-06 (1) and 2015-16 (2), while their finishing this season is amongst the worst in the league. So the question for Eddie Howe is should Woltemade feature in the League Cup to get him valuable minutes with the team, or should the Germany Under-21 international be wrapped in cotton wool for the Premier League game against Arsenal on Sunday?
Thumbs up for yes, thumbs down for no. Image source, BBC SportImage caption, Newcastle have struggled to take their chances in this season's Premier League

Manchester City dominated the League Cup during the early years of Pep Guardiolaâs reign, lifting the trophy in four of his first five seasons in charge. Remarkably, City won 21 consecutive ties in the competition between 2017 and 2021 (with two-legged semi-finals counted as a single âtieâ). But it has been a different story since then, with Guardiolaâs team losing four of their subsequent seven EFL Cup games. That is partly a result of shifting priorities. The City manager said 12 months ago he didnât intend to âwaste energyâ in the competition and would instead field his âsecond teamâ, vowing to prioritise the Premier League and Champions League. The Spaniard still picked a fairly strong side for last seasonâs fourth-round exit to Tottenham, albeit he didnât risk star striker Erling Haaland, keeping him on the bench. With City having taken part in this summerâs Club World Cup and the expanded Champions League format also meaning more matches, Guardiola will be acutely aware of the need to manage the minutes played by his squad and reduce the risk of late-season burnout.

Image source, Getty ImagesJames Trafford sealed a dream return to Manchester City in the summer, but will the English goalkeeper now be questioning his decision?The 22-year-old came through the City academy but did not make a first-team appearance before moving to Burnley in 2023, featuring in their relegation and playing a key role in their promotion back to the top flight last season.At the start of this season Trafford was handed the number one shirt at City and was expected to challenge Ederson for the first-choice spot - in fact, he may have been ahead of schedule by starting the first three Premier League games of the campaign.But the script was ripped up on deadline day when boss Pep Guardiola sold Ederson to Fenerbahce and instead of placing full faith in Trafford, the appeal of bringing in Gianluigi Donnarumma from Paris St-Germain for Â£26m proved too good to turn down.He gets the chance to impress again though against Huddersfield in the Carabao Cup on Wednesday night after Guardiola confirmed he would start the third-round tie.

Image source, Getty ImagesWe were in the Olympic Stadium last night. It's huge, holds about 70,000. I'm not sure it'll be completely full, but there's a team with loads of experience, obviously, of playing in Europe and a manager in Manuel Pellegrini, who has managed for years in European competition an awful lot as well.But although we say Forest haven't been in Europe for 30 years, obviously a lot of the players have. 17 of them have played in European competition before and they've got a coach in Ange Postecoglou who won the tournament last year.There's more to Forest, I guess, as a team in this tournament than maybe some people might be expecting. But you're right, Real Betis is probably the most difficult game they'll face out of the eight in this league phase and it'll be really interesting to see how Forest can fare against them, especially as in the last few weeks theyâre still yet to get a win under Ange Postecoglou.Will it suit them to just come away abroad, get away from the Premier League, get away from England and go and maybe play some of the football that we know Postecoglou likes to play? Maybe it will suit them here because Betis likes to play out from the back and if Forest can press high maybe they'll get some joy out of that as well. It's going to be fascinating viewing.
