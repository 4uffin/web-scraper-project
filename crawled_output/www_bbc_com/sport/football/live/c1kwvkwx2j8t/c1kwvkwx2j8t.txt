Javi Munoz lashed a shot wide just two minutes after the restart for the visitors, but Barca weathered this spell and sealed the success with the third. Rashford assisted a La Liga goal for the second game in a row, springing the offside trap and racing clear on the right flank before pulling the ball back for Olmo to fire home from the edge of the penalty area.And the Manchester United loanee was close to following up his two midweek goals with a first in La Liga, but Soria pulled off a fine save to deny him in stoppage time.Rashford has previously been punished for breaking team rules while at Manchester United - he did not feature in United's FA Cup win over Newport two days after reportedly being spotted in nightspots in Belfast in January 2024.He was also dropped for a win at Wolves in 2022 because he overslept and missed a team meeting.The game was played at the 6,000-capacity Johan Cruyff Stadium, where Barca's B team usually play, because the Nou Camp is not ready yet after being redeveloped.Related topicsSpanish La LigaGetafeBarcelonaFootballComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 213Spanish La Liga Scores & FixturesSunday 21st SeptemberRayo Vallecano 1 , Celta Vigo 1 at Full timeRayoRayo VallecanoRayo Vallecano11Celta VigoCelta VigoCelta VigoFull timeFTMallorca 1 , Atletico Madrid 1 at Full timeMallorcaMallorcaMallorca11AtlÃ©ticoAtletico MadridAtletico MadridFull timeFTElche 1 , Real Oviedo 0 at Full timeElcheElcheElche10OviedoReal OviedoReal OviedoFull timeFTBarcelona 3 , Getafe 0 at Full timeBarcelonaBarcelonaBarcelona30GetafeGetafeGetafeFull timeFTView all Spanish La Liga fixturesSpanish La Liga TableOn Sunday 21st SeptemberSkip to table keyMatch Participants:Barcelona, Position 2, Points 13Getafe, Position 8, Points 9TeamPlayedWonDrawnLostGoals ForGoals AgainstGoal DifferencePointsForm, Last 6 games, Oldest first1Real Madrid5500102815No ResultWResult WinWResult WinWResult WinWResult WinWResult Win2Barcelona54101631313No ResultWResult WinWResult WinDResult DrawWResult WinWResult Win3Villarreal5311104610No ResultWResult WinWResult WinDResult DrawLResult LossWResult Win4Espanyol531187110No ResultWResult WinDResult DrawWResult WinWResult WinLResult Loss5Elche52307439No ResultDResult DrawDResult DrawWResult WinDResult DrawWResult Win6Real Betis62319729DResult DrawWResult WinDResult DrawLResult LossDResult DrawWResult Win7Athletic Club53026609No ResultWResult WinWResult WinWResult WinLResult LossLResult Loss8Getafe530267-19No ResultWResult WinWResult WinLResult LossWResult WinLResult Loss9Sevilla52129817No ResultLResult LossLResult LossWResult WinDResult DrawWResult Win10AlavÃ©s52125507No ResultWResult WinLResult LossDResult DrawWResult WinLResult Loss11Valencia521268-27No ResultDResult DrawLResult LossWResult WinLResult LossWResult Win12Atletico Madrid51316516No ResultLResult LossDResult DrawDResult DrawWResult WinDResult Draw13Osasuna52034406No ResultLResult LossWResult WinLResult LossWResult WinLResult Loss14Rayo Vallecano512256-15No ResultWResult WinLResult LossDResult DrawLResult LossDResult Draw15Celta Vigo605157-25LResult LossDResult DrawDResult DrawDResult DrawDResult DrawDResult Draw16Levante51139904No ResultLResult LossLResult LossLResult LossDResult DrawWResult Win17Real Oviedo510418-73No ResultLResult LossLResult LossWResult WinLResult LossLResult Loss18Real Sociedad502359-42No ResultDResult DrawDResult DrawLResult LossLResult LossLResult Loss19Mallorca5023510-52No ResultLResult LossDResult DrawLResult LossLResult LossDResult Draw20Girona5014215-131No ResultLResult LossLResult LossLResult LossDResult DrawLResult LossView latest Spanish La Liga tableKeyPosition 1, 2, 3, 4 : UEFA Champions LeaguePosition 5 : UEFA Europa LeaguePosition 6 : UEFA Conference League QualifiersPosition 18, 19, 20 : RelegationLast Updated 21st September 2025 at 21:55Please Note: All times UK.
