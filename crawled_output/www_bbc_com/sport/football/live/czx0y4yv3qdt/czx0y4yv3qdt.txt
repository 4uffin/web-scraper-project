Image source, Getty ImagesEuropean champions Arsenal were held to a goalless draw at Manchester United in a Women's Super League game featuring few clear-cut chances.Olivia Smith's effort was tipped on to the crossbar by United goalkeeper Phallon Tullis-Joyce in the first half of an otherwise quiet affair.Both teams struggled to assert control on the game at Leigh Sports Village, enjoying brief spells of pressure but ultimately lacking in quality.There were tributes before and during the match to mark the sudden death of former Liverpool, West Ham and Chelsea manager Matt Beard on Saturday.Supporters also carried out a minute's applause in memory of former Sheffield United footballer Maddy Cusack, who died two years ago this week.Chelsea are now top of the WSL table having beaten Leicester earlier on Sunday, with United second and Arsenal third.

Manchester United manager Marc Skinner, speaking to BBC Sport: "You want to win games at home against teams like Arsenal. I thought the girls were incredible. If you look at the two weeks we've had, game after game after game, for us to perform in that way, it says a lot about the team."I'd take team over individuals every day. On a sad day for football, it was a show of great spirit from my team and that's something that I pride myself really highly on."On whether they did enough to get all three points: "We potentially did. Arsenal huffed and puffed, I don't think Phallon [Tullis-Joyce] had much to do. It ends in a draw deservedly, you'd be disappointed not to take a point at least. Sometimes it's a bore draw, but both teams were trying to win it which is credit to both teams." On his reaction to the performance: "I'm delighted. Please don't let my face tell you anything else. I'm just sad today. I'm happy with where the team's at. After the week we've had, to show the spirit they've shown - I'm ecstatic."Image source, Getty Images

Arsenal have started slowly in the last two games and it was the case here.Manchester United made them suffer, they didn't have shots inside the box. It was good for United because they could get bodies on the line and the keeper could make the saves and take the crosses.You can see Renee Slegers is disappointed with the result.

Manchester United midfielder Jess Park speaking to BBC One: "It's incredible to play alongside Melvine Malard. You try and get around her to link with her. She's a great bounce board and a joy to play with."Settling in: "I've really enjoyed it, I'm trying to find my feet at the minute and bring some energy. I'm really excited to be here and I'm enjoying my football as you can probably tell."On her role today: "Find the space and pick up the pockets and basically be free, find people and find the space. Sometimes it doesn't work but we are working on it and trying to find opportunities. We are trying to get higher sometimes and I have to recognise the space to go wider and try different things."I just want to play. I'm happy playing on the pitch. Wherever I can find space, I don't mind. I just need to be clever with my movements."

Arsenal boss Renee Slegers, speaking to BBC Sport: "We wanted to get three points so we are disappointed. We knew it was going to be a hard game. It's always tight against United. "What we do well is the things out of possession, we give away a couple of things but we keep a clean sheet. That is the foundation for us to do things forward. In the final third we didn't have the quality like we usually do in our decision-making and execution."It's getting the numbers up, getting in right spaces and quality of decision and execution, the goalkeeper did really well but of course we want to get more shots on target."We wanted more. These games are always very tight."

Phallon Tullis-Joyce has really improved from last season. She pulled off a great save against Olivia Smith in the first half and when she has been needed today she has stepped up.She caught crosses in the second half to release the pressure and help her team.

Manchester United goalkeeper Phallon Tullis-Joyce, speaking to BBC Sport: "A very, very intense game. A great game for both sides. I am so proud of my team, especially after that five-game stretch. We came out here, gritted it out and I am so proud of my team-mates."On limiting Arsenal to one shot: "They were very good with their services, so they kept me busy with the crosses but that's just a testament to our defensive line and putting in the work and keeping them to one shot in the game."On whether there is disappointment to come away with a draw: "We just made it through the qualifiers in the Champions League so we are very happy right now. Sure, we could put some more in the net but I am very happy for my team right now. It shows how far we have come and how far we will keep going."On United's start to the season: "Rapid fire. We just had to strap on our boots and get ready to go. I'm thrilled to be here, it's a good problem to have."Image source, Getty Images

I thought it was a really evenly-matched game. Both teams have been scoring a lot. But Man Utd are very well organised.With just one shot on target all game, this free-flowing Arsenal team struggled to break down a really stubborn, resilient Man Utd side.

Manchester United really had to work hard, particularly in the second half.They were solid in their backline and prevented Arsenal from getting shots on goal so I think they will be happy with a 0-0.Renee Slegers, though, will see it as a missed opportunity.

Roberto: Based on the season so far and how even these teams have been, it could well be them that are in a title fight. My team (Chelsea) might have maximum points but have been unconvincing, basically since the turn of the year back into last season.
