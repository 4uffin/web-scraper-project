Levante get one back! It's a bit of a strange goal. Ivan Romero's cross loops up off a Real Madrid defender towards the back post.Thibaut Courtois is caught on his heels and flapping at fresh air as Etta Eyong climbs to nod the ball in from barely a yard out.Game on.

He will have the chance to draw level with Vanderlei Luxemburgo, who won his first seven games in 2005, in the Madrid derby at Atletico on Saturday.Barcelona can reduce Real's lead at the top when they visit Oviedo on Thursday.Related topicsSpanish La LigaReal MadridFootballComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 120Spanish La Liga Scores & FixturesTuesday 23rd SeptemberAthletic Club 1 , Girona 1 at Full timeAthleticAthletic ClubAthletic Club11GironaGironaGironaFull timeFTEspanyol 2 , Valencia 2 at Full timeEspanyolEspanyolEspanyol22ValenciaValenciaValenciaFull timeFTLevante 1 , Real Madrid 4 at Full timeLevanteLevanteLevante14Real MadridReal MadridReal MadridFull timeFTSevilla 1 , Villarreal 2 at Full timeSevillaSevillaSevilla12VillarrealVillarrealVillarrealFull timeFTView all Spanish La Liga fixturesSpanish La Liga TableOn Tuesday 23rd SeptemberSkip to table keyMatch Participants:Real Madrid, Position 1, Points 18TeamPlayedWonDrawnLostGoals ForGoals AgainstGoal DifferencePointsForm, Last 6 games, Oldest first1Real Madrid66001431118WResult WinWResult WinWResult WinWResult WinWResult WinWResult Win2Barcelona54101631313No ResultWResult WinWResult WinDResult DrawWResult WinWResult Win3Villarreal6411125713WResult WinWResult WinDResult DrawLResult LossWResult WinWResult Win4Espanyol6321109111WResult WinDResult DrawWResult WinWResult WinLResult LossDResult Draw5Athletic Club631277010WResult WinWResult WinWResult WinLResult LossLResult LossDResult Draw6Elche52307439No ResultDResult DrawDResult DrawWResult WinDResult DrawWResult Win7Real Betis62319729DResult DrawWResult WinDResult DrawLResult LossDResult DrawWResult Win8Getafe530267-19No ResultWResult WinWResult WinLResult LossWResult WinLResult Loss9Valencia6222810-28DResult DrawLResult LossWResult WinLResult LossWResult WinDResult Draw10Sevilla6213101007LResult LossLResult LossWResult WinDResult DrawWResult WinLResult Loss11AlavÃ©s52125507No ResultWResult WinLResult LossDResult DrawWResult WinLResult Loss12Atletico Madrid51316516No ResultLResult LossDResult DrawDResult DrawWResult WinDResult Draw13Osasuna52034406No ResultLResult LossWResult WinLResult LossWResult WinLResult Loss14Rayo Vallecano512256-15No ResultWResult WinLResult LossDResult DrawLResult LossDResult Draw15Celta Vigo605157-25LResult LossDResult DrawDResult DrawDResult DrawDResult DrawDResult Draw16Levante61141013-34LResult LossLResult LossLResult LossDResult DrawWResult WinLResult Loss17Real Oviedo510418-73No ResultLResult LossLResult LossWResult WinLResult LossLResult Loss18Real Sociedad502359-42No ResultDResult DrawDResult DrawLResult LossLResult LossLResult Loss19Mallorca5023510-52No ResultLResult LossDResult DrawLResult LossLResult LossDResult Draw20Girona6024316-132LResult LossLResult LossLResult LossDResult DrawLResult LossDResult DrawView latest Spanish La Liga tableKeyPosition 1, 2, 3, 4 : UEFA Champions LeaguePosition 5 : UEFA Europa LeaguePosition 6 : UEFA Conference League QualifiersPosition 18, 19, 20 : RelegationLast Updated 23rd September 2025 at 22:27Please Note: All times UK.
