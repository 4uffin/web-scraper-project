Aston Villa boss Unai Emery speaking to BBC Sport: "Frustrated and disappointed a little bit, but not with the result. It should have been easier to
take advantage [against 10 players] but we were not playing with our identity,
with the ideas we have been building in the last three years. "With some new players we have to adapt with
the players we have, and we know we want to control the game, to dominate but I am
disappointed and frustrated more for how we were not achieving our identity."There
is still work to do with the point we achieved, itâs not enough, of course,
after playing with one more player for 60 minutes, we should be happier, we
have to work and be demanding, to get our consistency through our demands."

Sunderland manager Regis Le Bris told BBC Sport: "The value of this one is really important because we had different experiences today."We started really well 11 v 11, we were in our gameplan, well connected with the opportunities and were in a good place."Then the red card came - but the team reacted really well. It was important to stay 0-0 and then at half-time we decided on a new game plan."They did really well with the deep block and it became a set-piece game. Then after we conceded we reacted well again. The way we want to play together, to react, to suffer, we knew this would be the case often."

I'm a hugely disillusioned Villa fan now. We look disjointed and out of ideas. We have a great manager and good players, but the output at the minute is not good enough.Chris

Bournemouth boss Andoni Iraola, speaking to Sky Sports: "It was different to the other Newcastle Bournemouth from the past. They were trying to make the game very slow, very compact. We were putting pressure on them. We have been very solid but we haven't been as brilliant to make the difference."We knew today that they have players who are super tall. We tried to play more through the middle. I'm very happy how we defended set pieces because I knew the size would be a problem. We didn't concede a lot of set pieces in the first half because we played in their half.On possible Thiaw red card: "The Newcastle bench decided to take him out, it's a clear second yellow. I don't know if it would make a difference because there wasn't much remaining."We have been very competitive and we have won games. We were competiting very well. Some games we have been more brilliant that today. We need to keep building."

Newcastle boss Eddie Howe, speaking to Sky Sports: "It was mixed. I think there were some really good things. Defensively we were good. You want to see the team defending our box well. We were strong, robust. We didn't create the amount of chances we would want but it's a really hard place to come. "If you look at the games we've played, it's not by luck we've kept these clean sheets. We weren't as aggressive but it was a mixture of Wednesday and getting the best out of our players. On Malick Thiaw: "I thought we saw his qualities as an outstanding player. Very promising debut from him. He was getting fatigued at the end.
Not seen it again. On penalty shout: "My initial instinct was that it was a penalty. The defender
tugged on Nick's shirt. "We pride ourselves on scoring goals and being an attacking team but we're different from last year and we need to evolve."

Bournemouth boss Andoni Iraola, speaking to BBC MOTD: "We have to value the point, we are playing against a Champions League club. "I'm happy with the performance. The way we defended, we played in their half and we didn't concede many set pieces. The ones we did, we defended really well."It is a good start. We were not as brilliant today as we were in previous games but we have to be competitive. We have to keep this level of performance."

Newcastle boss Eddie Howe, speaking to BBC MOTD: "I haven't give it too much thought in terms of who deserves what. We know Bournemouth are a really good team. We limited them to long sots and Nick made some good saves. We didn't get our attacking game going. On no shots in second half: "It's not good. You want to create chances and clear cut chances. It didn't feel that in our performance. We are going through one of those phases where it's hard to score away from home. "Joelinton we have to really protect from injury. He's just back. Bruno is different but the two who played today did really well."We're evolving and changing as an attacking force. Our ability to defend has been at a high level and we will score goals."

Villa have an excellent manager. They also have a core in that team that has gone longer than it should have done, while they have had to sell key players to meet the regulations. If you want to talk about their drop-off, that's where you have to start.Matt, Birmingham

Unai Emery is definitely not happy and you can see why. It is just not clicking for Aston Villa. They look clunky, they don't look fluid, and they are not the same team that they were last year.They have got the first league goal off their backs but they didn't create a lot. And they were a bit slow, pedestrian in midfield.What they needed was a team to come out and attack them and be expansive, but they got a wall of red and white shirts determined not to let them past.

Bournemouth attacker Antoine Semenyo, speaking to Sky Sports: "I've been riding high for a little bit. The bar was set high and I want to contribute anywhere I can for the team. It's disappointing but it's a fair result. "There were a few opportunities. A point will do for us and we go to Leeds next week and hopefully get three."I think we wanted to attack the space a little bit more but it didn't happen as much today. We have to continue and find another way if that doesn't work. "It's been good. We just want to continue and not get too big headed. Take it game-by-game."Image source, Getty Images

Newcastle defender Dan Burn, speaking to Sky Sports: "It's not been the way we've played here in the past. Since I've been here we've never won. We changed up and went more direct. A point is good and we changed six or seven players today. It showed the depth we've got in this squad. "We've invested well in the summer and we've spent a lot of money. We should use those players and it's probably a lesson we've learned from the previous campaign in the Champions League. On clean sheet: "We've worked a lot on it. We have a good team there. We're happy and got something to build on. We've not attacked as we've liked but we are a very good attacking team"We grew into it. Start of the second we could have been braver and took more risks. On penalty shout: "I didn't see it to be honest. I'd have to see it again but I'll say it was a penalty."We've had a good summer bringing in players of a really high quality."

It would have been easy for Sunderland to fold with 10 men, the excuse was there for them. But they didn't look for excuses.They came out with a clear game plan, the set back five, very narrow and they were defensively resilient.They tried to force Villa down the middle into traffic and their togetherness as a defensive unit and the rigidity that they showed will stand them in good stead.

How long before Emery's position is seriously in danger? Villa are very lucky, against 10 men their goal shouldn't have gone in and with Sunderland hitting the crossbar they should really be losing. They lack belief and quality. For me he has run his course.Mark, Ely

Very frustrating for Aston Villa, but they got what they deserved, and that wasn't a win. They were not good enough and they didn't create enough going forward. That is the same story we have seen all season. Sunderland came out with their back five with midfield in front and said to them, 'Go on, break us down,' and the only way they were able to was the long distance strike from Cash, where the keeper should have done better.Image source, Getty Images

A draw away at in-form Bournemouth without Bruno, Joelinton and Gordon playing isn't a bad result but that performance was so so flat. Don't think their keeper made a save.Mark, Toon fan

It's been a superb performance from Sunderland in this second half. They have shown grit, determination, and it is one of those games that will feel like a win. For Aston Villa it will feel like three lost points.
