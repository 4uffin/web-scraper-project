Selles "I believe in myself". Makes him the only man in Sheffield who does. He should read the social media reaction. Selles has the difficult choice to swallow his pride and quit or get sacked in the morning.JB

Image source, Rex FeaturesSheffield United boss Ruben Selles has been talking to Sky Sports after his side slumped to a fifth-straight loss to start the season. Here's some of what he had to say."Obviously it's very difficult. We need to accept it and not give excuses and try and find a way out of the situation," he said."I think the first half we were on top of the game and they had a couple of situations."I think Philogene did an excellent job and we struggled to stop him. We need to win more of our duels to be more competitive.(On leaving skipper Gus Hamer out of the XI) "I never gamble with the selection. It was the team I thought had the best chance of getting us a result."If you don't win football matches your position is going to be discussed, not only for me but for every coach in the world. We have to keep working hard until the end."The owners have been supporting me until today. I haven't spoken to them after the game. I'm not worried about that, I'm just worried about how we can do things better. I'm the first one to give pressure to myself."I believe in myself. I will always be in front of anything that has my name."We are not going to solve anything tonight but we have to analyse. The good thing about football is you have another game in seven days and it's another opportunity."

Image source, Getty ImagesThis has been an excellent night. It has ended Ipswich's barren spell. They are up and running.I am wondering if that is going to be the style of play.Sheffield United - who are not a bad team - dominated the ball for long spells and enabled Ipswich to play a way that I haven't seen under Kieran McKenna before.They were counter-attacking. They were quick and divisive, but played differently from all those games in League One, the Championship and the Premier League.

Tonight's a good night for us," he said."We felt like we weren't too far away and there's been some good things coming and a lot of it came out tonight."We've worked really hard with Jaden in pre-season and he's worked really hard as well. There had been some good signs but without the end-product."We said it was a difficult summer for us and I felt there was a different vibe in the group in the past few days. I've felt a real determination to come together as a team and push on. It really felt like the first game tonight."We know how hard the season is.

Fans have been calling BBC Radio Sheffield to reflect on Sheffield United's 5-0 defeat at Ipswich Town:Ben: Getting rid of Wilder was just baffling. The players have no fight. They just gave up after the second and third goal. Darren: I can guarantee you that is [Ruben Selles'] last game. I do not understand why he picked Tom Cannon tonight.Kane: It's an absolute joke.

The first half was really tough. I've got a lot of respect for Ruben because his sides press really hard and it's difficult to get out and play."Our talent at the top end can hurt teams and it was a different challenge from what we had from Derby and Preston before â to get the rewards we got in the second half we had to show a lot of resilience and strength."On the performance of hat-trick scorer Jaden Philogene:"It's a boost for Jaden on an individual level â he came to us late last season and was playing on the right and we know he prefers to play on the left but we had some injuries so we had to play him on the right."We've done a lot of work with him in the summer â for him it will be a big boost to his confidence and we know what qualities he can bring to the side.Sheffield United boss Ruben Selles:"The first goal comes from an interception 70 yards from our goal. The second goal changed the game and I think we fell apart. We can analyse the changes and the shape but we were competitive until the second goal."After a 5-0 defeat it's tough to talk about some positives but in the first half we saw the team we want to be."It doesn't matter what I believe (about my future) but I will keep working until the last moment â I have to take the pain and analyse what we want for the next game to try to beat the next opponent [Charlton on Saturday, 20 September]."To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.This video can not be playedMedia caption, The Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.
