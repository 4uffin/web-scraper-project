"I think that's probably our strength, we've got match winners one to 11 and if it's someone's day they can get us over the line."T20 Blast: Somerset pull off record final run chase to beat HampshireLynn powers Hants past Northants into Blast finalPublished13 SeptemberSomerset beat Lancs to reach third straight Blast finalPublished13 SeptemberAlbert stars in losing causeImage source, ReutersImage caption, Hampshire opener Toby Albert made his sixth half-century in this season's T20 BlastIt was fitting that 23-year-old Albert, who has enjoyed a breakthrough season for Hampshire, starred in the final albeit in a losing cause.The Basingstoke-born wicketkeeper has played in all of Hampshire's 17 matches up to the final, scoring 633 runs at an average of just under 50.Vince, who has featured in every one of Hampshire's 11 Finals Day appearances, also went past 500 runs for the season and looked hugely disappointed when he was caught on the boundary after making 52.Albert combined pure power in smashing two huge leg-side sixes with some incredible reverse flicks to the rope off the pace bowlers.He looked on course to become the second Hampshire batter to score a century on Finals Day following Lynn's heroics in the semi-final win over Northants but was bowled by Gregory while backing away.However, his second-wicket stand of 97 with captain Vince following the early dismissal of a fatigued Lynn set Hampshire up for a record-equalling score of 194 in a final â matching the 194-2 made by Northants against Surrey in 2013.It lasted a mere 90 minutes as Somerset set a new milestone in reaching the target with an over to spare.'We did it the hard way again' - reactionSomerset captain Lewis Gregory told BBC Radio Five Live Sports Extra: "Unbelievable, super chuffed for the boys, we did it the hard way again [after taking 19 off the final over to beat Birmingham in the quarter-finals]."It's great to be part of this team. Year in, year out we're challenging for this trophy and to get over the line is mighty special."It's much easier out there than to be watching, I guess you're in control of things. When you're watching, you're wishing the lads to smash a few out of the park and to do it is an amazing feeling."We've been in tough spots and someone has pulled us out. We've got a team with guys who can win matches on their own and we've seen that over the past few games."Hampshire head coach Adrian Birrell told BBC Radio Five Live Sports Extra: "I thought we did quite well to get to 194. Toby Albert and James Vince were outstanding then we had a little bit of a cameo at the back from Benny Howell, so you kind of think at halfway you've got a score and then for a long time during that innings we were in the game but we couldn't quite just peg them back. "Every over and boundary they were getting, I don't think we executed that well."It was quite difficult to defend here with the outfield being so slick with the dew that had come in. A bowler going down in Chris Wood didn't help either but we weren't quite on it with our execution and that hurt us."They batted very, very well. Will Smeed played a match-winning innings in a final and all credit to him."I'm very proud of my team. It was a good campaign from us but we fell at the final hurdle and unfortunately cricket is cruel."Related topicsHampshireSomersetCricketMore on this storyNotifications, social media and more with BBC SportPublished16 AugustComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 471Top storiesMcIlroy & Fleetwood reunite in Ryder Cup foursomesPublished4 hours agoAmerica's gladiator - DeChambeau's road to Ryder Cup talismanPublished4 hours agoBarcelona come from behind to beat Cazorla's OviedoElsewhere on the BBCThe gang who stole over Â£50 million from taxpayersDrs Chris and Xand get to the bottom of back painStacey and Joe welcome you back to Pickle CottageMatcha: From centuries-old tradition to global health trendElsewhere in SportWhere Ryder Cup battle will be won and lostThe battles England need to win in World Cup finalMartin feels heat again, but are Rangers players letting him down?
