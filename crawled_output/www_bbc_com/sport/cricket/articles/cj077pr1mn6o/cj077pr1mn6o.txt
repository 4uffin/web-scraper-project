TablesIndia and Pakistan's players did not shake hands again as India comfortably won the sides' feisty second meeting at the Asia Cup by six wickets in Dubai.There were no handshakes when India beat Pakistan last Sunday - the rivals' first meeting since the military conflict between the two nations earlier this year - which resulted in a complaint by Pakistan to organisers and doubts around their continuation in the competition.Having both progressed to the Super Four stage, the captains did not acknowledge each other at the toss and the two teams did not shake hands after India cruised to a chase of 172 with seven balls to spare. There were a series of heated flashpoints during the chase, most notably when the umpire had to step between opener Abhishek Sharma and Pakistan bowler Haris Rauf."The way they were coming to us without any reason I didn't like at all," Abhishek said afterwards."I just wanted to deliver for my team."Abhishek and Shubman Gill exchanged words with various Pakistan bowlers during their first-wicket partnership of 105 in 59 balls for the first wicket, which broke the back of the chase.Gill made 47 and Abhishek 74 from 39 before Tilak Varma sealed the win - India's seventh in a row against Pakistan across formats - with a six to finish 30 not out.Earlier, Pakistan opener Sahibzada Farhan hit 58 from 45 balls and celebrated his fifty by using his bat to mimic firing a gun.India and Pakistan engaged in a four-day military conflict in April following a deadly militant attack on tourists in India-administered Kashmir.Pakistan reached 91-1 after 10 overs and took 42 runs from the last three but, despite India dropping five matches, were punished for losing their way in between. There was a run of 40 balls without a boundary during the middle overs - India seamer Shivam Dube particularly effective in taking 2-33.Unlike after last week's meeting when captain Suryakumar Yadav paid tributes to India's armed forces, neither he nor Pakistan captain Salman Agha referenced the wider situation at the post-match presentation.Pakistan play Sri Lanka on Tuesday, while India's next game is against Bangladesh on Wednesday. If they finish in the top two of the four-team group they will meet again in Sunday's final.Related topicsPakistanIndiaCricketMore on this storyNotifications, social media and more with BBC SportPublished16 AugustTop storiesGuardiola gamble almost pays off as Liverpool cash inPublished5 hours agoCox leads England to T20 series win over IrelandPublished8 hours agoPiastri 'drops ball' but did Norris miss opportunity?Published7 hours agoloading elsewhere storiesElsewhere in SportGB fail to win gold for first time in 20 years - where it went wrongMartinelli snatches late draw for Arsenal against Man City.
