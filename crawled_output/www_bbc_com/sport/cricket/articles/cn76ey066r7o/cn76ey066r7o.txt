The decision comes before next year's T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka, and the 50-over World Cup, for which South Africa are co-hosts, in 2027.It is also a boost to South Africa, and international cricket more widely, amid the power of franchise leagues. Proteas batter Heinrich Klaasen, one of the world's leading T20 batters, retired from international cricket in June."Quinton's return to the white-ball space is a major boost for us," South Africa coach Shukri Conrad said. "When we spoke last month about his future, it was clear that he still has a strong ambition to represent his country."Everyone knows the quality he brings to the side, and having him back can only benefit the team."De Kock's only cricket this year has been in T20 leagues - the SA20 in South Africa at the start of the year, followed by the Indian Premier League, Major League Cricket and the Caribbean Premier League.At his best, he has been one of the best white-ball batters of the past decade with only Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma scoring more ODI centuries than De Kock's 21 since his debut in January 2013.He was also South Africa's leading run-scorer at last year's T20 World Cup.South Africa play two Tests, three ODIs and three T20s in Pakistan, starting on 12 October.Injured captain Temba Bavuma will miss the Tests - their first since winning the World Test Championship in June - meaning Aiden Markram will lead in his place.Donovan Ferreira will be captain for a one-off T20 against Namibia that follows the tour.South Africa squad for Pakistan Tests: Aiden Markram (capt), David Bedingham, Corbin Bosch, Dewald Brevis, Tony de Zorzi, Zubayr Hamza, Simon Harmer, Marco Jansen, Keshav Maharaj (second Test only), Wiaan Mulder, Senuran Muthusamy, Kagiso Rabada, Ryan Rickelton, Tristan Stubbs, Prenelan Subrayen, Kyle VerreynneSouth Africa's squad for Pakistan T20s: David Miller (capt), Corbin Bosch, Dewald Brevis, Nandre Burger, Gerald Coetzee, Quinton de Kock, Donovan Ferreira, Reeza Hendricks, George Linde, Kwena Maphaka, Lungi Ngidi, Nqaba Peter, Lhuan-dre Pretorius, Andile Simelane, Lizaad WilliamsSouth Africa's squad for Pakistan ODIs: Matthew Breetzke (capt), Corbin Bosch, Dewald Brevis, Nandre Burger, Gerald Coetzee, Quinton de Kock, Tony de Zorzi, Donovan Ferreira, Bjorn Fortuin, George Linde, Kwena Maphaka, Lungi Ngidi, Nqaba Peter, Lhuan-dre Pretorius, Sinethemba QeshileSouth Africa's squad for Namibia T20: Donovan Ferreira (capt), Nandre Burger, Gerald Coetzee, Quinton de Kock, Bjorn Fortuin, Reeza Hendricks, Rubin Hermann, Kwena Maphaka, Rivaldo Moonsamy, Nqaba Peter, Lhuan-dre Pretorius, Andile Simelane, Jason Smith, Lizaad WilliamsRelated topicsSouth AfricaCricketMore on this storyGet cricket news sent straight to your phonePublished16 AugustDe Kock to retire from ODIs after World CupPublished5 September 2023Top storiesEurope 'fuelled by something money canât buy' - DonaldPublished2 hours agoWhy 'Wood has to watch his back' as Igor Jesus shines Published1 hour agoRodgers' 'realism' hints at Celtic's new normal in Europa LeaguePublished1 hour agoElsewhere on the BBCThe life of Gordon Welchman, a WW2 codebreaking heroThe best and worst foods to eat at sports groundsThe life and career of the iconic 1960s model, TwiggyLooking at the political language that defined recent monthsElsewhere in Sport'A cool scene' - but will Bethpage's first tee intimidate Europe?Chasing greatness through grief - England's warrior queenLamine Yamal - the eve of a new football era'Bird became cricket legend without scoring a run for England'Who are the players in England's Ashes squad?Why NFL Dublin opens 'new chapter' for Irish sportHow will each side fare in Prem Rugby?
