I think we all need a breather after that! We'll be back on Sunday for the series decider at Trent Bridge, which starts at 14:30 BST - but I should give you advance warning that the forecast is not looking good. Before then, though, it's Blast Finals Day and there will be live text coverage here for you tomorrow starting with Lancashire v Somerset at 11:00 BST - and you'll also find radio commentary on BBC Sounds. Here is Elizabeth Botcherby's match report from this evening if you missed any of the fun. Bye for now!

England's 146-run win was their biggest in terms of runs in T20s, one of many records broken this evening. Phil Salt added a few more to his own collection - his 39-ball century was the quickest for England, and his eventual 141 was the highest individual score for an England batter in the format.

South Africa captain Aiden Markram speaking to Sky Sports after their loss:"Yeah it's a tough one. Probably started getting it wrong from the toss, so that one's on me. Two masterclasses up front from them and when you're put under that amount of pressure it's tough to come back. Sometimes it lasts for six to eight overs, today it lasted for the full 20. We'll have to come up with some good plans and take it on again on Sunday.On reflecting on their own performance: "We'll look into something more. You expect good wickets these days in T20's, and there's world class players all over the world and when they get into that 'red hot' zone you need to have some plans in place. It's always going to be nice to put some of those plans together and have another chance to get those right."On preparation before the final game of the series on Sunday: "I don't think we'll get any training beforehand - it's been a busy tour. It'll be nice to put some minds together and have a casual conversation over a coffee and see how we can be better. It's important as a team we never stop learning and we'll have to take quite a few lessons from tonight."

South Africa will be very disappointed with the way they bowled.As well as Phil Salt and Jos Buttler batted, South Africa did not execute tonight.They won't want to make those same mistakes twice.

England really do have an embarrassment of riches in all three formats now, gone are the days when there were the same 7 or 8 names across the formats. Home grown world-class talent vying for a lot more international caps. And a warm welcome for T20 to 'Bazball'!Jon Todd, Ramsgate

Image source, Getty ImagesEngland captain Harry Brook: "Pretty lost for words. The way them two started off was just phenomenal."Me and Jos were stood out there and said we never thought anyone get 300. With batting line-up we have got there are not many heights we can't reach. "Every must-win game we have now leading to the T20 World Cup is awesome preparation for us. Having the new learnings and taking it forward to World Cups..."On Phil Salt and the strength in depth at the top of the order: "There are going to be some tough decisions to be made. We like headaches. There are some phenomenal players there."

South Africa started quite nicely with the bat, reaching 50 in just over three overs, but once the first wicket fell there was no stopping England.Jofra Archer was the star with 3-25, Sam Curran was brilliant with 2-11 and Will Jacks chipped in with two at the death.

England centurion Phil Salt, speaking to Sky Sports: "That was really good fun. A personal milestone but the fact we got 300 and won by such a big margin, I can't have asked for much more."On whether he plans to make such quick starts: "Sometimes it is case of reacting other days I pick days I want to jump start just because of how the mood takes me."On the Old Trafford pitch: "Everyone that comes here knows it is a really good wicket in the powerplay and might slow up later. I wanted to get us off to as quick a start as possible."On breaking Liam Livingstone's record for the fastest England century: "I might give him a text. I won't rub it in. He has a big day tomorrow."

That's a big awakening for some of the players for South Africa who haven't played so much.But when you see the likes of Marco Jansen and Kagiso Rabada travel that much you can see the quality of the wicket and the batters.

Good luck to everyone editing highlights packages this evening, is all I'll say. Enjoy the best bits of the Phil Salt and Jos Buttler carnage as England posted 304-2. (Yes, you read that correctly.) Unsurprisingly, Salt is named player of the match. We'll hear from him shortly.

It's not very often you play the perfect game in cricket, but I'd say England have played the perfect game there. You couldn't have written that any better from a coaching or playing point of view. What a day for Phil Salt - he walked out and hit the first three balls for boundaries and when you start like that, it immediately puts the opposition under so much pressure.

As dominant a display as you'll ever see. Liam Dawson has Kagiso Rabada caught by Jofra Archer for the final wicket and South Africa are cleaned up for 158. The series is set up nicely for a decider on Sunday.
