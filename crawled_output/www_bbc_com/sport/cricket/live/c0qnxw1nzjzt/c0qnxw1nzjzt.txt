Player of the match Phil Salt: "I enjoyed that. It's a pretty good wicket and a good ground to bat on when you get going. It was fun. We both try and take it on fairly early, when it works it looks good.""There was no chat in the dressing room other than to bat but it was a really good effort from Ireland, they did really well to get that total.""I donât want to start thinking about stats. We've come here and got the win, weâre happy about that.""Ireland have had a look at us now, they're going to have different plans, so are we. It's always that way in bilateral series."

Winning the first one is always nice."A great feeling and can't waiting to go again on Friday."On Ireland's total: "It was a good total. A ground like this was a bit of an unknown. Coming off we thought it was maybe a couple too many."Going into Friday and Sunday, we know the ground more, the dimensions and how to take wickets here."On Salt and Buttler at the top of the order: "Their opening partnership averages something like 55 with a ridiculous strike-rate. So, for me personally, batting after them is pretty nice!"On potential team changes for Friday: "The focus is on winning and then we'll see what happens after that."On Malahide atmosphere: "It's not many other sports you go from big stadiums to grounds like this, which is lovely."The atmosphere here is almost better than some of the big grounds. I hear it's sold out on Friday and Sunday so we can't wait."

Ireland captain Paul Stirling: "We'll take all the positives we can out of it. I was happy to go out there and get going.
Hopefully throughout this series we can improve in all areas. We couldn't have asked for much more from our batters. To score 196 in the end was great."It's tricky, I'm proud of the lads for the their effort. We couldn't have been ultra defensive, we had to seek the wickets and they came. We'll take the six as a positive and take it into the next game."We'll review what happened today and hopefully grow from it. We've got a big winter ahead of us. Proud of what we did today and hopefully on Friday and Sunday we can grow from it."

I'd be very surprised if England play the same 11 in all three games. They'll probably look to change it up a bit and give some other guys a go.

Ireland spinner Matthew Humphreys, speaking on TNT Sport: "We saw there was a bit of spin on offer. You kind of had to be brave and we didn't quite do that at times. They came at us and made it really difficult."On England's openers: "It's very difficult. You have to try and shut down one side of the ground as much as you can. I know they can access any area of the ground that they want to, which makes it very difficult."I think the way the lads went out there with the bat was amazing, it was an above par score. There's a few cobwebs there to dust off but we're back again on Friday."

Let' see what Jacob Bethell's temperament is like when he's put under pressure. Ireland weren't able to put him under any pressure today. It's far too early to speak on his captaincy but what I do know is that he can hit the ball very well.

Matthew Humphreys, who took 2-44 with his left-arm spin, admitted there were a few cobwebs among Ireland's attack. They had no answer Phil Salt until it was far too late.

I though Ireland's performance exceeded expectations considering the complete lack of preparation. I thought their attitude was first class, there's a lot of positives to take from it.
