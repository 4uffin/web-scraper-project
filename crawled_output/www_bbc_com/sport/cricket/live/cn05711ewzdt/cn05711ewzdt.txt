India have dominated matches against Pakistan in recent times.That is their sixth straight win over their big rivals.No handshakes between the two sides at the end of the game.

Suryakumar Yadav clubs the ball high over cow corner - into the crowd - and India have won it!They were always in complete control of the chase and the skipper finished unbeaten on 47 from 37 balls.

Very close - but not close enough for Pakistan.Pitching in line, impact in line but umpire's call on hitting the stumps.Clipping leg so it stays with the on-field decision.

With just three runs needed, Pakistan go up stairs for an lbw review against Suryakumar Yadav.The India skipper missed with a sweep off Sufiyan Muqeem.

Enormous!Shivam Dube gets in on the act with a huge hit down the ground off Saim Ayub.India are just five runs away now...

Suryakumar Yadav has the finish line in sight now.He gets a decent stride in and sweeps the ball hard behind square for four.Lovely shot.
223Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingInd 110-3published at 14 overs14 oversTarget 128
A pair of boundaries in the over for Suryakumar Yadav.The first is hit towards point, in the air but it dips just before the fielder and spins away to the fence.Two balls later, he goes back and crunches a cut shot through backward point for four more.India need just 18 more to win.

Good over from Saim Ayub, who has 3-22 from his first three overs, but India edge closer to victory nonetheless.The 100 is up for Suryakumar Yadav's side and Shivam Dube is out there with the skipper now.

Saim Ayub is back and takes his third wicket with a beauty!Driven into the pitch by the off-spinner and the ball pitches back of a length on off stump.Tilak Varma goes back to punch it through the off side but it straightens, beats the edge and thuds into off stump.

The over ends with an lbw review from Pakistan - an extremely hopeful one - after Suryakumar Yadav misses with a sweep.It looked optimistic and so it proves. Umpire's call on impact but turning away from the right-hander and missing off stump by a distance.

Oh dear.The game might already be gone but Pakistan miss the chance to at least improve the manner of the loss as Mohammad Nawaz puts down a catch off his own bowling.It was pushed back at him by Tilak Varma but Nawaz sees the ball burst through his hands.Let off for Tilak and it rather sums things up for Pakistan.

Abrar Ahmed is bowled out and finishes with tidy figures of 0-16 from his four overs.Nicely as he's bowled, he ends wicketless when wickets are what Pakistan desperately need.

Suryakumar Yadav carves the ball away to the deep third boundary and as the players pause for drinks, India are closing in on victory.They could cruise from here but I fancy they'll look to get it done in a hurry.

That's huge!Slog sweep from Tilak Varma and he's nailed Sufiyan Muqeem high over deep mid-wicket into the stands.

Another very tidy over from Abrar Ahmed, the leggie has bowled very nicely.But India only need 4.9 an over from here, they can afford to see him off if they choose. He's only got one over left now.
113Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingInd 71-2published at 8 overs8 oversTarget 128
A first boundary for Suryakumar Yadav.Dragged down by left-arm spinner Sufiyan Muqeem and SKY lifts is up and over short fine leg.Easy pickings for a player of his class.

Left-arm Mohmmad Nawaz is the latest spinner to be used in the powerplay... but Tilak Varma takes a liking to him.Reverse sweep for four first, driven for two second and then a lofted drive over extra cover for four third ball.Thirteen from the over in total as the powerplay end with India almost halfway to their target already.
