England captain Jacob Bethell: "I couldn't have dreamed it any better. The rained out game was unfortunate but to come out 2-0 winners in my first series as captain is a great feeling. "We were nice and aggressive throughout the whole week. Today conditions were slightly different. We just wanted to carry on the momentum."I am looking for to it [returning to ranks as a player rather than captain]. I will let Brooky take the reins in NZ. I am looking forward to getting back into the ranks."

England player Phil Salt: "It's been brilliant to come and get the win today and to win the series. We've got a lot of cricket coming up, New Zealand next. It's nice to be hitting in form ahead of that.""There's bags of talent here, I know a lot of the guys well and I knew it would be stiff competition.""We've got a lot of players who've played a lot of cricket out there. We've got a lot of time off now and next is New Zealand."

Ireland captain Paul Stirling: "We took a lot of positives from the week. The staff did really well to get us going, we'll take a lot from it.""When you play against England I don't think you know what is a winning score. We were probably 15 short no matter who we were playing. Proud of the lads and the way they played today.""I don't think there's any surprise of how it's gone. There's patches where it went well and patches where it didn't go so well. We've got a lot of cricket coming up."On the fans: "They've been amazing. The players always want to play in front of people, we're really appreciative of crowds when we get them and hopefully they'll support us through the winter."

England spinner Adil Rashid speaking on TNT Sports: "There was a bit of purchase for the spinners but we bowled exceptionally well as a unit. We had to adapt to what paces were required and as a group we did very well."We are all looking for to it [next year's T20 World Cup]. We have New Zealand and Sri Lanka so tough times ahead but exciting times for England as a group."

The difference between the two sides has been the quality of the spin bowlers. I can't fault the effort from the Irish bowlers, it's about capacity and how much they can physically do.

Tom Banton hits Craig Young's first ball into the leg side for a single and that's the match.England win the match with 17 balls to spare and take the series 2-0.

England have played very well and with a lot of positive intent.
Ireland will not be happy with their bowling today.

Scores level.Rehan Ahmed picks up his first boundary, sending Gareth Delany through mid-on, before Tom Banton adds his sixth four with a shot through the covers.He then knocks a single through backward point to bring England up to Ireland's total.

Rehan Ahmed immediately gets off the mark with two behind square.Three more singles and that's Ben White done - he finishes with figures of 1-40.

Probably one of the only times that Ben White has given the ball any air. Jordan Cox got caught in two minds there, lovely innings from him.

Bowled him!Jordan Cox backs away a touch, offers a nothing-y shot and is cleaned up by the first delivery of Ben White's final over.Here comes Rehan Ahmed.

I think it's important for Ireland's spinners to get as many overs in as possible.

Gareth Delany's leg-breaks are rather belatedly introduced into the Ireland attack.Eight runs comes off his over, with Tom Banton striking him for four through long-on.

England's coaching team will be happy with this performance. They've played some good cricket and their batting has been controlled after that early collapse.

Four singles to end the over.Tom Banton drops the last of those just short of Ben White at short fine leg and the Ireland fielder's throw might have troubled Jordan Cox had he hit the stumps.

Just a lovely hit towards that short boundary. What's really impressed me with Jordan Cox is his hands. They are just so soft but he's been able to be so strong and quick with the bat.

A first international half-century for Jordan Cox!He brings it up in some style, dispatching Barry McCarthy over mid-wicket for his fourth six of the innings.His landmark comes up off 31 balls.
