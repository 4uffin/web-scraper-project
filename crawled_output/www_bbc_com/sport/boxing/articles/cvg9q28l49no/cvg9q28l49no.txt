Yet in the midst of our grief, we have been deeply moved by the overwhelming outpouring of love and support."Richard's memory will forever remain in our hearts, in the hearts of his fans, and in the sport he loved so dearly."A Greater Manchester Police spokesperson said "there are not currently believed to be any suspicious circumstances" surrounding Hatton's death.To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.This video can not be playedMedia caption, Why Hatton was the 'most popular' British boxerHatton, who won 45 of his 48 professional bouts during his 15-year career, was world champion at light-welterweight and welterweight, and last fought professionally in 2012."Richard was so much more than a world champion. To us he was simply 'Richard', our son. A loving father, grandfather, and brother, and a true friend to many," the Hatton family added."He inspired generations with his fighting spirit, his humility, and his love for the sport. But beyond the titles, the nights to remember, and the roar of the crowd, he remained the same down-to-earth Richard who never forgot where he came from."It has been a source of great comfort to see just how many lives Richard touched, and how widely he was admired and respected."At this time, we kindly ask for privacy as we come to terms with life without him. In the days and weeks ahead, we will take strength from one another and from the knowledge that Richard's legacy - both in boxing and as a man - will continue to live on."Watch: Ricky Hatton - A Tribute'There is, and always will be, only one Ricky Hatton'Published6 days ago'People's champion who fought with every part of his soul'Published6 days agoManchester to honour 'much loved' HattonImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Ricky Hatton (left) lost for the first time when he was beaten by Floyd Mayweather (right) in Las Vegas in 2007Nicknamed 'the Hitman', his all-action style saw Hatton became one of Britain's most popular fighters, with a loyal following.Those fans travelled in huge numbers to watch Hatton fight, with more than 30,000 heading to Las Vegas for his title bout with Floyd Mayweather in 2007.Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham praised Hatton, who was a hugely popular figure in his home city."Ricky was much loved by so many in Greater Manchester. He was the kind of person who would always turn up for people, supporting so many causes," Burnham posted on X."He made us smile and made us proud. We will find a way of honouring him properly. Rest in peace, Champ."Manchester City - the club Hatton proudly supported - paid tribute with a minute's appreciation before Sunday's meeting with Manchester United at Etihad Stadium.A 10-bell salute to Hatton was also made at the World Boxing Championships at the M&S Bank Arena in Liverpool.Former world champion Barry McGuigan, who became a trainer and promoter after retiring in 1989, told BBC Radio 5 Live that he used to go on training runs with Hatton."He [Hatton] had a huge following, he had a magnetic and engaging personality outside the ring too," McGuigan added.

We worked hard to get Manchester on the map - it wasn't a big fight town, but he was quite instrumental in that happening."He crossed over in a big way to the general public - they got behind him. He became a serious man of the people, a really nice guy."Former WBA lightweight champion Anthony Crolla told BBC Radio 5 Live: "There will never be another Ricky Hatton - no one will get close to him.
