If he won there was nothing left, and if he lost there was nothing left. He gave everything in victory and defeat."He should never have been as good as he was. He should never have had the fame and accolades and glory he had, but that was down to pure determination and desire."Hatton's parents made a small gym in the basement of their pub when he was 12, and it was there that he honed his skills on a punching bag.He rose through amateur and domestic levels to pit his wits against elite boxers of his generation, including Kostya Tszyu, Floyd Mayweather Jr and Manny Pacquiao.Hatton achieved a staggering 43-0 record before his first loss came at the hands of Mayweather at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas in 2007.Pacquiao, who inflicted Hatton's second career defeat in 2009, described him as a "great fighter inside the ring but also a brave and kind man in life".The Filipino wrote on social media: "We shared unforgettable moments in boxing history and I will always honour the respect and sportsmanship he showed. "Ricky fought bravely, not just in the ring, but in his journey through life. He truly had a good fight, and we are all blessed to have been part of his wonderful journey."

May he rest in eternal peace."Britain's former light-welterweight world champion Khan said Hatton was "a friend, a mentor, a warrior"."Rip to the legend Ricky Hatton may he rip," said former heavyweight world champion Fury on Instagram. "There will only ever be one Ricky Hatton. Can't believe this so young."Hatton had rare popularity, being a figure who managed to transcend his sport.During his peak he hung out with fellow Manchester City fans Liam and Noel Gallagher of Oasis.Oasis frontman Liam Gallagher posted on X: "Absolutely devastated to hear the news about Ricky Hatton. It was an absolute honour to know him and carry his belts. RIP champ. Live forever."Bunce said that Hatton "lived life fully" but was always willing "to take the mickey out of himself".Darts legend Phil Taylor and ex-England cricketer Andrew Flintoff were among those from other sports to pay tribute on social media.Former England and Manchester United footballer Rooney, who carried Hatton's belts into the ring before a fight with Jose Luis Castillo in 2007, said on X he was "devastated" and Hatton was a "a legend, a warrior and a great person".Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, More than 30,000 fans travelled to Las Vegas for Ricky Hatton's title fight with Floyd Mayweather in 2007Defeats to Mayweather and Pacquiao in 2007 and 2009 left Hatton deeply depressed and led to the darkest times of his life.After retirement he was candid about his struggles with drinking and mental health as he tried to fill a void in his life."Those of us in the business have lived with Ricky's ups and downs over the last 15 years," Bunce said."The highs and the lows, the great nights in Las Vegas and the great nights in Manchester. Some of those that were closer to him witnessed the dark holes, the depression and the dark thoughts."He has had some troubles. He talked about his mental health problems. He has talked about his addictions. He addressed them and faced them and attacked them."Hatton, who won 45 of his 48 professional bouts across a 15-year career, last fought professionally in 2012, suffering defeat by Ukraine's Vyacheslav Senchenko during a brief comeback.He later found some success as a trainer, proved to be an especially sought after after-dinner speaker, and beamed with pride at the rise to the professional ranks of his son, Campbell.Hatton fought an exhibition bout against Marco Antonio Barrera in 2022 and was scheduled to have another fight in Dubai in December."He was a man of the people and a spectacular fighter," former WBA featherweight champion Barry McGuigan wrote on X."A great man inside the ring and a wonderful man outside of it. RIP Ricky, my thoughts and prayers are with his family at this very difficult time."Related topicsBoxing'Even as a kid, Hatton was knocking everyone out'Published14 September'Ricky Hatton was one of us''Etched into British sporting folklore' - Hatton's life in picturesPublished14 SeptemberBoxing schedule and results 2025Published2 days agoWatch every Born to Brawl episodePublished28 April 2024More boxing from the BBCNotifications, social media and more with BBC SportPublished16 AugustTop storiesMcIlroy & Fleetwood reunite in Ryder Cup foursomesPublished7 hours agoAmerica's gladiator - DeChambeau's road to Ryder Cup talismanPublished7 hours agoBarcelona come from behind to beat Cazorla's OviedoElsewhere on the BBCThe gang who stole over Â£50 million from taxpayersDrs Chris and Xand get to the bottom of back painStacey and Joe welcome you back to Pickle CottageMatcha: From centuries-old tradition to global health trendElsewhere in SportWhere Ryder Cup battle will be won and lostThe battles England need to win in World Cup finalMartin feels heat again, but are Rangers players letting him down?
