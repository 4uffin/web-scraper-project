Before the media conference, Eddie Hearn spoke to BBC Radio 5 Live about the aftermath of the first fight: âIn the changing room after, everyone was so proud of Conor â
he had got so much stick, then the internet was saying he was a hero, the peopleâs
champion. He was pleased with how deep he dug, but he lost. And thatâs
unacceptable for a winner.âHe is just a little bit more mature. At the presser Eubank
will come with his bag of tricks, but Conor wants to get into camp. He says he
can be so much better, outbox him let alone outfight him.â

We can't cover this media conference without reference to where this all began - the 1990 bout between Chris Eubank Sr and Nigel Benn.Eubank stopped Benn in the ninth round to claim the WBO middleweight title in Birmingham, but that was only the beginning of their bitter feud.The pair met again three years later at Manchester United's Old Trafford with both fighters holding world titles at super-middleweight. A split draw meant they both went home with their respective belts.More than 30 years later, their sons face off in a rematch of their own.To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.This video can not be playedMedia caption, Relationship with dad more important than boxing - Benn

At the end of June, it was announced that Conor Benn and Chris Eubank Jr would renew their rivalry on 20 September.However, by 17 July, Team Benn were concerned Eubank didn't want to fight. Three days later, Benn's promoter Eddie Hearn was declaring the rematch was definitely off.But after all that, here we are.Their first bout was like capturing lightning in a bottle. A carefully managed event that had no business happening but did. And it was fun to watch.Can organisers recapture the same magic? We know Eubank can make the weight. We had the incredible WWE-style arrival of Chris Eubank Sr on fight night. We saw a weight-drained Eubank do enough to keep the smaller Benn at bay for a comfortable points win.Will the rematch produce the same intrigue? We shall find out, presumably in November.Image source, Reuters

Conor Benn's trainer Tony Sims is now getting a word in edgeways."It was a tremendous fight for the fans. Conor knows he has to make adjustments to beat Chris, and he has enough in his locker to do that."He was too emotionally invested in the first fight, it was his first fight at middleweight and topping the bill in a big stadium. His first loss. He has to overcome these, and I think he will do that."
