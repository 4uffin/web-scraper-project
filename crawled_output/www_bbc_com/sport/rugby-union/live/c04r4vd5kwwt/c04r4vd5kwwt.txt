This is tectonic. There's relief as well as elation. The elation will have to wait for another week. What a moment to beat New Zealand in a knockout game. But they've still got a big hill to climb this week.

Tactically, you have to respect the Canadian women's team, what they've done to get here. They are hard workers, man. And what a huge moment this is for Canada rugby. As the tears flow, this is incredible.

Canada player Sophie de Goede: "I don't think we've gone and done it yet, we've got one more job left to do. So much relief and pride after that match. The Black Ferns are six-time world champions, we knew we had to put in an incredible performance today."Our tagline is Be-leaf, Belief. We've defied the odds time and time again and that propels you forward. We've fostered a knowledge in the group that we can overcome anything."The defensive focus was huge this week. Our attack has been firing all tournament, but we knew we had to do a big job in defence. We were able to do that today and that's why you saw that result."Her message to the fans back at home: "Thank you so much for your support. But I know we have one job left to do for you guys. The dream is to win a World Cup, and getting to the final is a huge part of this. Words can't express how much your support means to us."How will she watch England vs France: "Hopefully with my feet up in bed. Maybe in the tub, I don't know."

This is a journey that doesn't stop now for them. There's such a felling of belief, of momentum. The group won't be satisfied with just this. This cannot be the momentum for Canada. They've got to keep driving.
