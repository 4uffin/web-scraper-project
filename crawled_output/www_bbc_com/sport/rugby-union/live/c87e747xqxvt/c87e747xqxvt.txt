Ireland head coach Scott Bemand on BBC Two: "First of all, well done to France. That was a really hard Test match to play with the conditions and the occasion. It was a winner takes all game, and we pushed them hard. There are a few moments that were game-changing moments. We will grow with experience and we'll get better in those moments."

Ireland will be disappointed with some of the moments they didn't convert. It's such small margins when you get to the knockout stages of a World Cup.

Ireland centre Eve Higgins on BBC Two: "We're just sad. We came very close to a semi-final. That was the goal. We had moments where we knew we could have scored the points that would have been be enough. Full credit, we put in a huge shift. It was a 90-minute performance and we couldn't have asked for more. We're just proud."

I still think France are behind the other three (New Zealand, Canada and England). Next week is the moment they have been waiting for. Today didn't suit them, but the tenacity they showed in defence, and stick to their game plan, spoke volumes. They were incredible courageous today.

France weren't gelling and they are still able to get moments of magic. They got into the semi-finals by the skin of their teeth.

I don't think Ireland could have given anymore today. They are playing to their maximum at the minute.

Congratulations France, what a second half to close it out. For Ireland to play so well, they are clearly disappointed with the result, because they had an opportunity against a world-class team but plenty to be proud of.

We've just seen a replay of the final moment and it was Manae Feleu who got the crucial touch on the line-out. A World Cup-saving intervention.Brittany Hogan, who was on the bench after limping off earlier in the game, just fell to her knees in tears.

For France, they will now face England or Scotland in the semi-finals. That one is live on BBC One from 16:00 BST.We'll have more reaction from this one as it comes in.

After the lows that women's rugby in Ireland reached a few years ago, this has been a remarkable journey for Scott Bemand's team. This won't be the last you see of this Irish team.

We can't fault the Irish efforts, just the execution at the end.

The Irish players look broken, and who can blame them. It's strange, France look relieved more than anything.

France got a touch on the line out and that forced Ireland to spill it. That was the decisive moment.
