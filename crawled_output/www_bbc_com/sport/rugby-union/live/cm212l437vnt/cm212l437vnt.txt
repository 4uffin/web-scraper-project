Australia head coach Jo Yapp, speaking to BBC Sport: "We are incredibly disappointed. "We knew Canada, if we gave them opportunities with the ball, what they are capable of.

I have loved working with them, they have really welcomed me and my family. "I will treasure memories forever."On the 2029 World Cup: "This team are capable of winning that World Cup.
They need that support and investment."
