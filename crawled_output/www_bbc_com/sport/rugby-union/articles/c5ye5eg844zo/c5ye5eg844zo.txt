Joanna Grisez's score from inside her own half with 13 minutes to go completed the comeback to set up a semi-final with England next weekend.Ireland, who did not qualify for the tournament in 2022, were seeking to reach a first World Cup semi-final since 2014 but have still not beaten France since 2017.The game was marred by controversy with France back row Axelle Berthoumieu later cited for an alleged bite on Ireland's Aoife Wafer who was playing in her first Test since April after successive knee injuries.Black Ferns beat South Africa to reach semisPublished13 SeptemberCanada thrash Australia to set up New Zealand semiPublished13 SeptemberWith the wind at their backs, Ireland dominated the first half from start to finish.Indeed, there was more than half an hour on the clock by the time France even touched the ball in the opposition half. Given the conditions, it was no surprise that Ireland fly-half Dannah O'Brien looked to put boot to ball at every opportunity, and it was from one such kick that Ireland were able to take an early lead.Number eight Escudero was left to deal with a testing kick in behind only to touch the ball in flight before it went dead to give Ireland the scrum five metres out.While Ireland could not get over at the first attempt, the returning Aoife Wafer pounced on a loose ball before Sam Monaghan forced her way across.As France prepared for the restart, the television match official (TMO) intervened to show a Wafer knock-on. Having been playing with advantage, Ireland tried again with prop Djougang this time barging across after Niamh O'Dowd and been stopped short. With French tight head Rose Bernadou shown a yellow card for a high tackle, Ireland were able to double their advantage when, attacking off a scrum, Wafer carried hard at the line before O'Brien released Flood to get across the whitewash with a quarter of an hour of the first half remaining.O'Brien converted neither of Ireland's two tries but did add three points off the tee in the 38th minute after her pack had won a scrum penalty. When French captain Manae Feleu was shown a yellow card minutes later for collapsing a dominant Irish scrum with the clock in the red, Bemand's side looked to add another before the break.With only 14 on the pitch, France produced a stunning defensive set to keep the score 13-0 at the break.France comeback seals place in semi-finalsTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.This video can not be playedMedia caption, Does Berthoumieu bite Wafer in quarter final?Playing the second half without the wind in their favour, Ireland's breakdown and scrum retained the same fierce edge in the opening exchanges after the restart, although French full-back Bourgeois got her side on the board with a penalty in the 48th minute.As the hour-mark approached, France were still struggling to find their way into the game but were boosted when Ireland replacement Grace Moore was sent to the sin bin for a high tackle.From the resulting penalty, the French would make the extra player count when Escudero had the space to scamper over for her side's first try of the game. Bourgeois' conversion cut Ireland's lead to just three with a quarter of the game remaining.With the wind having eased, Ireland enjoyed a spell of pressure in a more even second half but, as they looked to extend their lead, France broke away from inside their own 22 for Grisez to score the game's key try.Bourgeois' second penalty of the day left Ireland needing a try to force extra time but, despite France's Alexandra Chambon being shown her side's third yellow card of the game for a deliberate knock-on in the final minute, Ireland were turned over at a line-out in the final play.Line-upsFrance: Bourgeois; Grisez, Menager, Vernier, Arbey; Queyroi, Bourdon Sanus; Brosseau, Gerin, Bernadou, M Feleu (capt), Fall Raclot, Berthoumieu, Champon, Escudero.Replacements: Bigot, Deshaye, Khalfaoui, Ikahehegi, Okemba, T Feleu, Chambon, Boulard.Yellow cards: Bernadou, Feleu, Chambon.Ireland: Flood; Parsons, Dalton, Higgins, Costigan; O'Brien, Reilly; O'Dowd, Jones, Djougang, Campbell, Monaghan, Tuite, Wafer, Hogan.Replacements: Moloney MacDonald, Perry, McGrath, Corri-Fallon, Moore, Lane, Breen, McGann.
