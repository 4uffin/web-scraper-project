Pardon!" said Tessier, quickly correcting herself.Ultimately, her slip of the tongue landed on the right answer. It will be Red Roses against Maple Leafs in an autumnal blockbuster at Allianz Stadium.But for nearly an hour at Ashton Gate on Saturday, the identity of the second finalist was very much in doubt.France were only two points off England. Any score would have put them in front. The party playlist, with disco hits blasting through stoppages, felt out of kilter with the rising tension.The try that finally let England fans relax into what ended up being a 35-17 win came via the most popular route possible.Star full-back Ellie Kildunne scooped up a loose ball at full pelt and carved her way past four floundering French defenders before gleefully diving over.Kildunne is the face of the tournament.Before every match, her voice swirls around the stadium as part of an advert for the tournament's official beer. Today, she sported new cheetah-print footwear as part of the deal with her boot sponsor. For weeks in the build-up to the tournament she was plastered on murals, billboards and countless social media posts to push tickets.She has been a good pick. Every time England's team is announced, her name is cheered the loudest. Her popularity outstrips every other player in the tournament.But, until now, England have been waiting for an A-list performance on the pitch.Kildunne sparkled at times against the United States on the opening day, was rotated for the win over Samoa, was short of her best against Australia and then missed the quarter-final win over Scotland with concussion.This though was the sort of sustained glitter that earned her the world player of the year award last December.She beat 12 defenders - no-one else on the pitch managed more than three- en route to amassing an eye-popping game-high total of 208 metres with ball in hand.Perhaps most importantly for head coach John Mitchell were the less obvious bits. She fielded everything in the backfield and was strong through contact.Maybe it was coincidental, but with Kildunne in the line-up, there was also a touch more swagger to England as well.The superb Megan Jones celebrated one of four turnovers with a Cole Palmer-style 'cold' celebration.Hannah Botterman, equally impressive, emerged from the depths of a breakdown, brandishing three fingers to mark her own tally.Amy Cokayne gave the France front row a cheery wave after earning a penalty at the scrum.And, of course, Kildunne, who hushed France captain Marine Menager after a second-half scuffle, threw up a lasso as part of her usual square-dance celebration after her tries.To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.This video can not be playedMedia caption, 'Kildunne is pretty special' - England coach reaction to reaching World Cup finalAfterwards, as she was presented with the player of the match gong, Kildunne said she felt she had "stolen" the award.There were plenty ready to make her case for her though."She was pretty special today wasn't she? If she gets a bit of space, she is phenomenal," said Mitchell."The metres she made were incredible, her footwork was incredible," added former Black Fern Ruby Tui."The pressure came on her, she did not perform well in a couple of the games until this win. She sat out with a HIA last week, she had to perform, for herself, her country and her confidence."And this is what happens. She turns up, she's in your face, and she says 'what pressure?'"'We have not won anything' - England set sights on finalPublished4 days agoKildunne stars as England see off France to make finalPublished4 days agoEngland beat France to reach World Cup final - how it happened and reaction"She was unplayable and when you have a player like that receiving the ball in space, she is going to cause some damage," said former England head coach Simon Middleton."She said a couple of years ago 'I want to be the best player in the world'. She is the best player in the world, and proved it today."Next weekend, England will attempt to prove they are the best team.According to the rankings, they are by a distance.But Canada and Tessier's all-court demolition job on New Zealand suggested the gap is far smaller than the spreadsheet claims.To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.This video can not be playedMedia caption, England's Kildunne 'proved why she's world's best player'With Rouet watching on from some of Ashton Gate's expensive seats, there were some England weaknesses on show to factor into his gameplan.Their backline failed to flow as it should. Inside centre Tatyana Heard may come under pressure from Holly Aitchison, who came on to create the final try for Jones, if Mitchell wants to risk unsettling things in search of a little more fluidity.France's quick hands outflanked England's onrushing defence on a number of occasions, exposing the hosts out wide.England have also developed a habit of giving up the impetus just after they have seized it. Nassira Konde's second try and Kelly Arbey's score came shortly after Kildunne and Cokayne had gone in at the other end.Ironing out those issues will be on Mitchell's to-do list this week. But top will be getting his side into the necessary state of mind for a trip into the unknown.England have been to six straight World Cup finals, but their seventh, on home turf, with a record 82,000 in the stands, and expectation weighing heavier than ever, will be new, unforgiving territory for the Red Roses and women's rugby in general.They need their headliners to come to the party once again.Women's Rugby World Cup final: Canada v EnglandSaturday, 27 September at 16:00 BSTTwickenhamWatch on iPlayerWatch live on BBC One & iPlayer from 15:00 BSTRelated topicsRugby UnionMore on this storyRugby Union Weekly podcast: England are in the World Cup final!Comments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 789Top storiesEurope 'fuelled by something money canât buy' - DonaldPublished2 hours agoWhy 'Wood has to watch his back' as Igor Jesus shines Published2 hours agoRodgers' 'realism' hints at Celtic's new normal in Europa LeaguePublished2 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCThe life of Gordon Welchman, a WW2 codebreaking heroThe best and worst foods to eat at sports groundsThe life and career of the iconic 1960s model, TwiggyLooking at the political language that defined recent monthsElsewhere in Sport'A cool scene' - but will Bethpage's first tee intimidate Europe?Chasing greatness through grief - England's warrior queenLamine Yamal - the eve of a new football era'Bird became cricket legend without scoring a run for England'Who are the players in England's Ashes squad?Why NFL Dublin opens 'new chapter' for Irish sportHow will each side fare in Prem Rugby?
