When on form, they can be clinical in attack and resilient in defence."We are never going to be perfect, but to win this tournament you don't have to be perfect," head coach Mitchell said, urging his players to "trust what we have built".The battles England need to win in World Cup finalPublished10 hours agoWhat makes Canada so good and will they cause World Cup upset?Published2 days agoEngland v Canada: Rugby World Cup final guidePublished14 hours agoKevin Rouet's Canada, ranked number two in the world, have looked a class above all their opponents this tournament and delivered a remarkable semi-final performance to sweep past New Zealand and reach their first World Cup final since they lost to England in 2014.Canada are semi-professional, and have had to crowdfund nearly a third of the budget for their World Cup campaign - they are currently 95% of the way towards their million-dollar fundraising goal entitled Mission: Win Rugby World Cup.His side, who lost the semi-final 26-19 to England at the last World Cup, is captained by centre Alex Tessier and contains star goal-kicking lock Sophie de Goede.Eight of the starting XV play in the Premiership Women's Rugby league for English sides."I think we were very close in the last World Cup," said Rouet, who was appointed just over six months before that tournament."We lost in the semi-finals against England and I would say all of the metrics were in our favour but not the score, so it's kind of hard sometimes."But we were not ready on those high pressure games to deliver and I think that's a big difference."We changed the way we play, for sure, and I think I saw a year and a half ago that we were going in the right direction and we do a lot of good stuff."Canada's team contains three survivors from the 2014 World Cup final defeat - 38-year-old flanker Karen Paquin starts, while fellow forwards Olivia DeMerchant and Tyson Beukeboom are named on the bench.England have been professional since 2019 and are favourites to win a home World Cup in front of an 82,000-capacity, sold-out Twickenham.Saturday's crowd will surpass the 58,498 who watched England beat France at the same stadium in the 2023 Six Nations - the previous record for a XV-a-side match - and the 66,000 who watched the women's rugby sevens at Stade de France during the 2024 Olympics in Paris."Playing a World Cup final at Allianz Stadium [Twickenham] in front of a record 82,000 is a significant milestone for the sport," Mitchell said."We are well prepared for the challenge. It is number one versus number two in the world, and we know the contest will demand a full 80 minutes."Canada have been outstanding and have played some really great rugby. They have grown as well and are fitter. They deserve to be in the final."His side defeated Canada by nine points when they met in the WXV1 last year in Vancouver.

Our players don't always need to be perfect. We have been effective and that is all that matters," Mitchell said.One selection which illustrates Mitchell's point about selection being based on the trust they have built over the past two years - rather than being based on the semi-final - is the retention of Tatyana Heard.The inside centre struggled against France but over time has formed a formidable partnership with Jones, who has been a standout performer and works best alongside her midfield partner.Heard runs hard and straight, helping create space for Jones to use her lethal footwork, while replacement Aitchison is a different style of inside centre as a second playmaker.Mitchell also values his bench combinations and the impact they can bring.Both Aitchison and Packer performed well last Saturday and because of that will be expected to make an impact in the second half of the final.England usually finish games strongly, with their bench adding impetus, and in a World Cup final that is likely to be vital.To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.This video can not be playedMedia caption, Red Roses answer quickfire questionsRelated topicsRugby UnionMore on this storyHow England 2025 boomed into biggest Women's Rugby World Cup everPublished3 days agoMeet the England players going for World Cup gloryChasing greatness through grief - England's warrior queenPublished1 day agoComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 465Top storiesMcIlroy & Fleetwood reunite in Ryder Cup foursomesPublished5 hours agoAmerica's gladiator - DeChambeau's road to Ryder Cup talismanPublished5 hours agoBarcelona come from behind to beat Cazorla's OviedoElsewhere on the BBCThe gang who stole over Â£50 million from taxpayersDrs Chris and Xand get to the bottom of back painStacey and Joe welcome you back to Pickle CottageMatcha: From centuries-old tradition to global health trendElsewhere in SportWhere Ryder Cup battle will be won and lostThe battles England need to win in World Cup finalMartin feels heat again, but are Rangers players letting him down?
