I love kicking and find it cathartic to go out kicking by myself, and so I just kept up with it as I enjoyed it."I get people in the stands saying 'I am a forward and kick too' and I love watching you."Eales' size 13 shoes are not the first big boots De Goede is aiming to fill, with both her parents, Stephanie and Hans, having captained Canada at World Cups.She emulated her parents by leading Canada at the last World Cup and would have probably done so again but for an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury in June 2024, which denied her the chance to play in the Olympic sevens tournament."My parents were always nervous that if they coached me too much then it would feel like there is a lot of pressure," said De Goede, who plays in the back row for her club side Saracens."They helped me find my own way in rugby to find the player that I am myself. I grew up playing fly-half and they were both forwards."Where they have really helped me is in leadership lessons. They both captained Canada and learned a lot along the way in terms of how to interact with team-mates and be a better leader and person."Star back row Miller to miss Black Ferns semi-finalPublished5 days agoRugby World Cup semi-final: England v France previewPublished3 days agoKildunne back from concussion for France semi-finalPublished5 days agoTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.This video can not be playedMedia caption, Canada's Sophie de Goede 'nails' kick from the touchlineKick, pass, carry, scrum, jump - De Goede can do it all and was recently described by former England captain Katy Daley-McLean as the best player in the world.With De Goede only able to play three times prior to the World Cup, centre Alex Tessier was selected to skipper Canada at the tournament in England.The lock's focus remained on returning to full fitness and the form that helped Canada secure second spot in the world rankings behind England.An infection in the knee of her right leg - the one she uses to kick - delayed her recovery, but a barnstorming player-of-the-match performance against Wales, which included 20 carries, 108 metres gained and 12 points, showed she was back up to speed.Despite still being on antibiotics to help cope with swelling, another individual award was then collected after a 13-point haul in a comfortable quarter-final victory over Australia.A turning point for rugby in Canada?Despite needing a Â£530,000 fundraising drive called Mission: Win Rugby World Cup, amateur side Canada are ranked above the defending champions at number two in the world."I have 100% confidence that we are going to take the next step," De Goede said."I say that with a lot of respect for the Black Ferns because they are current World Cup holders and you can never underestimate New Zealand in a rugby context."Everyone knows what a powerhouse nation they are and an incredible brand of rugby they play."We have to back ourselves and I believe we have every ability to pull it off."De Goede watched the 2014 World Cup final from the stands in France when Daley-McLean's England defeated Canada.The goal for the lock is to help develop rugby in her native country, and she believes reaching and winning a final is the only way."Rugby really has the opportunity to explode in Canada, but we've not been on this
big global stage where we've had a grand performance to inspire the nation and the next generation," she added."This is our opportunity to have that turning-point moment for the sport of rugby in Canada."To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.This video can not be playedMedia caption, Canada and New Zealand semi-final 'will have everything' - analysisRelated topicsRugby UnionComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 213Top storiesEngland give surprise Ashes call to spinner JacksPublished6 minutes agoKirk killing increases Ryder Cup risk - New York policePublished2 hours ago'I flew 5,500 miles and paid Â£900 for a Premier League ticket but was turned away'Published9 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCA respectable man leads a vicious 'firm' of thugsHow did PlayStation games help Rooney at Manchester United?Panorama investigates the desperate shortages of food in GazaKerry James Marshall, painter, shares his cultural influencesElsewhere in Sport'I flew 5,500 miles and paid Â£900 for a Premier League ticket but was turned away'Has modern football adopted the Allardyce playbook?
