However, the committee upheld the original decision.The Berthoumieu bite occurred as Ireland won a penalty turnover in the second half of their 18-13 defeat by France at Sandy Park.Ireland captain Sam Monaghan said she raised the incident with referee Aimee Barrett-Theron, but no action was taken during the match.At the Independent Foul Play Review Committee (FPRC) hearing, it emerged the television match official could not determine "clear and obvious foul play" at the time.The FPRC was able to reach its decision with the help of written evidence as well as all broadcast angles.France were trailing 13-0 at the time of the incident but recovered to set up a last-four meeting with England at Ashton Gate.Related topicsRugby UnionMore on this storyListen: Sport's Strangest Crimes - BloodgateAttributionSoundsListen to the latest Rugby Union Weekly podcastAttributionSoundsTop storiesGuardiola gamble almost pays off as Liverpool cash inPublished5 hours agoCox leads England to T20 series win over IrelandPublished8 hours agoPiastri 'drops ball' but did Norris miss opportunity?Published6 hours agoloading elsewhere storiesElsewhere in SportGB fail to win gold for first time in 20 years - where it went wrongMartinelli snatches late draw for Arsenal against Man City.
