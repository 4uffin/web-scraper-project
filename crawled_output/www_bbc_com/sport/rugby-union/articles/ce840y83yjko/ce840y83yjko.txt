However, the committee upheld the original decision.The Berthoumieu bite occurred as Ireland won a penalty turnover in the second half of their 18-13 defeat by France at Sandy Park.Ireland captain Sam Monaghan said she raised the incident with referee Aimee Barrett-Theron, but no action was taken during the match.At the Independent Foul Play Review Committee (FPRC) hearing, it emerged the television match official could not determine "clear and obvious foul play" at the time.The FPRC was able to reach its decision with the help of written evidence as well as all broadcast angles.France were trailing 13-0 at the time of the incident but recovered to set up a last-four meeting with England at Ashton Gate.Related topicsRugby UnionMore on this storyListen: Sport's Strangest Crimes - BloodgateListen to the latest Rugby Union Weekly podcastTop storiesEurope 'fuelled by something money canât buy' - DonaldPublished2 hours agoWhy 'Wood has to watch his back' as Igor Jesus shines Published1 hour agoRodgers' 'realism' hints at Celtic's new normal in Europa LeaguePublished1 hour agoElsewhere on the BBCThe life of Gordon Welchman, a WW2 codebreaking heroThe best and worst foods to eat at sports groundsThe life and career of the iconic 1960s model, TwiggyLooking at the political language that defined recent monthsElsewhere in Sport'A cool scene' - but will Bethpage's first tee intimidate Europe?Chasing greatness through grief - England's warrior queenLamine Yamal - the eve of a new football era'Bird became cricket legend without scoring a run for England'Who are the players in England's Ashes squad?Why NFL Dublin opens 'new chapter' for Irish sportHow will each side fare in Prem Rugby?
