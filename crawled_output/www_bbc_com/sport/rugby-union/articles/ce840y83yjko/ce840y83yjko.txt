However, the committee upheld the original decision.The Berthoumieu bite occurred as Ireland won a penalty turnover in the second half of their 18-13 defeat by France at Sandy Park.Ireland captain Sam Monaghan said she raised the incident with referee Aimee Barrett-Theron, but no action was taken during the match.At the Independent Foul Play Review Committee (FPRC) hearing, it emerged the television match official could not determine "clear and obvious foul play" at the time.The FPRC was able to reach its decision with the help of written evidence as well as all broadcast angles.France were trailing 13-0 at the time of the incident but recovered to set up a last-four meeting with England at Ashton Gate.Related topicsRugby UnionMore on this storyListen: Sport's Strangest Crimes - BloodgateListen to the latest Rugby Union Weekly podcastTop storiesMcIlroy & Fleetwood reunite in Ryder Cup foursomesPublished7 hours agoAmerica's gladiator - DeChambeau's road to Ryder Cup talismanPublished6 hours agoBarcelona come from behind to beat Cazorla's OviedoElsewhere on the BBCThe gang who stole over Â£50 million from taxpayersDrs Chris and Xand get to the bottom of back painStacey and Joe welcome you back to Pickle CottageMatcha: From centuries-old tradition to global health trendElsewhere in SportWhere Ryder Cup battle will be won and lostThe battles England need to win in World Cup finalMartin feels heat again, but are Rangers players letting him down?
