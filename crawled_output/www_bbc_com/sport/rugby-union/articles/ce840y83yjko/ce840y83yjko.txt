However, the committee upheld the original decision.The Berthoumieu bite occurred as Ireland won a penalty turnover in the second half of their 18-13 defeat by France at Sandy Park.Ireland captain Sam Monaghan said she raised the incident with referee Aimee Barrett-Theron, but no action was taken during the match.At the Independent Foul Play Review Committee (FPRC) hearing, it emerged the television match official could not determine "clear and obvious foul play" at the time.The FPRC was able to reach its decision with the help of written evidence as well as all broadcast angles.France were trailing 13-0 at the time of the incident but recovered to set up a last-four meeting with England at Ashton Gate.Related topicsRugby UnionMore on this storyListen: Sport's Strangest Crimes - BloodgateListen to the latest Rugby Union Weekly podcastTop storiesHow best in the world Dembele finally lived up to his potentialPublished3 hours agoWhy Spain's Bonmati won record third women's Ballon d'OrPublished3 hours agoHampton's rise to best keeper in the worldPublished4 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCYour first look at Alan Partridgeâs 'brave' new projectIs it time to copyright your face?The return of a trippy, comic joyrideHow did a duck help solve this 19th-century murder case?Elsewhere in SportHow best in the world Dembele finally lived up to his potentialWhy Spain's Bonmati won record third women's Ballon d'OrHampton's rise to best keeper in the worldHorner, the Â£52m pay-off, and what next for ex-Red Bull boss?How England 2025 boomed into biggest Women's Rugby World Cup everWhy Friday's opening session is likely to shape Ryder CupWhy do West Ham keep conceding from corners?GB fail to win gold for first time in 20 years - where it went wrongMartinelli snatches late draw for Arsenal against Man City.
