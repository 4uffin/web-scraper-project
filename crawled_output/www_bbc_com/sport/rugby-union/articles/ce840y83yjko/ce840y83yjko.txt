However, the committee upheld the original decision.The Berthoumieu bite occurred as Ireland won a penalty turnover in the second half of their 18-13 defeat by France at Sandy Park.Ireland captain Sam Monaghan said she raised the incident with referee Aimee Barrett-Theron, but no action was taken during the match.At the Independent Foul Play Review Committee (FPRC) hearing, it emerged the television match official could not determine "clear and obvious foul play" at the time.The FPRC was able to reach its decision with the help of written evidence as well as all broadcast angles.France were trailing 13-0 at the time of the incident but recovered to set up a last-four meeting with England at Ashton Gate.Related topicsRugby UnionMore on this storyListen: Sport's Strangest Crimes - BloodgateListen to the latest Rugby Union Weekly podcastTop storiesFormer Liverpool manager Beard dies aged 47Published50 minutes ago'Norris misses opportunity in chaotic qualifying'Published5 hours ago'He deserves to be in our history' - Fernandes inspires Man UtdPublished2 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCA respectable man leads a vicious 'firm' of thugsThe best and worst foods to eat at sports groundsZara McDermott explores the dark side of ThailandChuck Wepner: The real-life Rocky who floored AliElsewhere in Sport'Incredible' Kildunne adds swagger to party as England reach World Cup finalEkitike gives Liverpool boss Slot dream striker conundrumKildunne and Jones shine as England beat France to reach final.
