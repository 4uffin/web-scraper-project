The Wallaroos had no answer.Black Ferns beat South Africa to reach semisPublished13 SeptemberCanada racked up the fastest average ruck speed of any team in the pool stage and their relentless tempo denied their opponents, coached by former England captain Jo Yapp, any chance to set themselves in defence.The excellent Sophie de Goede, back from a serious knee injury earlier this year, combined with Crossley and centre Florence Symonds before wing Alysha Corrigan stretched out to produce a superb one-handed dot-down on 13 minutes.De Goede strolled in around the fringe and Corrigan got her second, before prop McKinley Hunt marched over for a fifth Canada try just before half-time as a well-worked line-out move gave her pack momentum.Australia had only Desiree Miller's early breakaway to show for their first-half efforts as they headed down the tunnel 31-5 down.The deficit could have been even deeper, with Canada twice knocking on as they attempted to ground the ball over the line.Number eight Fabiola Forteza dunked the ball down for a sixth Canada try after 49 minutes and, while Australia scrapped gainfully, the loudest cheers from the 16,571-strong crowd for most of the second half were for a shot of USA centre, one-time Bristol Bear and social media phenomenon Ilona Maher in the stands appearing on the big screen.To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.This video can not be playedMedia caption, Paquin symbolises drive and determination of Canada - analysisFlanker Karen Paquin scooted in late on to take Canada past the winning margin England had amassed against Australia in Brighton last weekend.Canada have reached the Women's World Cup final only once, losing to England in 2014 on the most recent occasion the Red Roses lifted the trophy.With England on the opposite side of the draw, the two would only meet in the title decider this time around. This Canada team are well capable of taking revenge.First, though, they have to depose holders New Zealand in a blockbuster semi-final on Friday at Ashton Gate.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Ilona Maher spent three months at Bristol Bears last season, with interest causing several of their games to be moved to Ashton GateWhat they saidCanada head coach Kevin Rouet: "I told them at half-time we are too Canadian - we are nice people. "Where we do 80m and when we have to finish the last 10cm, we forget to do the job. "We could have scored more in the first half to put the game away and we let Australia potentially believe in the second half, but after that we just managed the game, so yes, I was quite pleased with the performance."On Friday's semi-final against New Zealand: "It's going to be a fun and exciting game on both sides. You have two teams who want to play so I think it's good to see that. "I just hope it is a good 80 minutes of rugby, for sure I want to win in the end, but I want to show a good brand of rugby in front of everyone."Australia head coach Jo Yapp: "We knew if we gave them time and allowed them to quick ball, they are a really dangerous side and that showed in the first half. They were able to get in behind us and get their offloading game away and it becomes really challenging."Australia captain Siokapesi Palu: "Today we saw how fast Canada can play and their athleticism and how they were able to just run through us."The one thing that contributes to that athleticism is they get to train more often in high-intensity environments and programmes and so they get the consistency and luxury of that, whereas we don't."We need continuity, we need to be able to become full-time. "We're looking at a group of players who are young mums who are balancing, looking after their kids. People are working full-time, working nine-to-five, then having to back it up with back-to-back trainings until 9pm."And then having to repeat that the next day. I know it sounds like a cliche, but we do need to be invested in so that we can produce good rugby."Line-upsCanada: Schell; Corrigan, Symonds, Tessier (c), Hogan-Rochester; Perry, Pelletier; Hunt, Tuttosi, Menin, De Goede, O'Donnell, Crossley, Paquin, Forteza.Replacements: Boag, Kassil, DeMerchant, Beukeboom, Royer, Senft, Apps, Seumanutafa.Australia: Halse; Stewart, Friedrichs, Smith, Miller; Moleka, Wood; Kavoa, Talakai Karpani, Leaney, Leonard, Duck, Chancellor, Palu (c).Replacements: Amosa, Pohiva, O'Gorman, Fernandez, Marsters, Tuinakauvadra, Hinds, Pomare.Related topicsRugby UnionComments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 499Top storiesMcIlroy & Fleetwood reunite in Ryder Cup foursomesPublished4 hours agoAmerica's gladiator - DeChambeau's road to Ryder Cup talismanPublished4 hours agoBarcelona come from behind to beat Cazorla's OviedoElsewhere on the BBCThe gang who stole over Â£50 million from taxpayersDrs Chris and Xand get to the bottom of back painStacey and Joe welcome you back to Pickle CottageMatcha: From centuries-old tradition to global health trendElsewhere in SportWhere Ryder Cup battle will be won and lostThe battles England need to win in World Cup finalMartin feels heat again, but are Rangers players letting him down?
