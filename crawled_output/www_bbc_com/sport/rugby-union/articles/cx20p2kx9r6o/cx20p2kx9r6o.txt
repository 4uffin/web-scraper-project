Ellie Kildunne scored two tries on her comeback as England dug deeper than they have all tournament to see off a stubborn France and book their place in a seventh successive Women's Rugby World Cup final.Kildunne, who missed the last-eight win over Scotland with concussion, thrillingly sliced France open either side of the break.However, France were never out of the contest. The underdogs trailed 7-5 at half-time but could easily have led as England errors gave them a wealth of possession and territory.The Red Roses improved after the interval, with a familiar driving maul delivering a try for hooker Amy Cokayne, before a short-range effort from Abbie Ward gave the hosts breathing space on the scoreboard.Kildunne, who had scampered in for the game's opening try after four minutes, then seized on Marine Menager's heavy attempt to control the ball with her foot and weaved through the remnants of the France defence to make it 28-12 with a little over 10 minutes to go.France centre Nassira Konde crossed for her second try to close the gap, but Meg Jones ensured England had the final say as she latched on to replacement Holly Aitchison's kick to dot down.The cheers that greeted Kildunne's player of the match award from the 25,478-strong crowd were just as loud.Canada, who outplayed defending champions New Zealand on Friday night, await in the 82,000 sell-out at Twickenham's Allianz Stadium next Saturday.To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.This video can not be playedMedia caption, Kildunne scores fantastic try to give England early lead'We have not won anything' - England set sights on finalPublished2 days agoKildunne comes to party to add swagger to semi-final winPublished2 days agoEngland beat France to reach World Cup final - as it happened & reactionEngland outlast France after nervy first halfTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.This video can not be playedMedia caption, 'Kildunne is pretty special' - England coach reaction to reaching World Cup finalWithout a clutch of first-choice players missing through injury and suspension, France's odds had lengthened in the build-up.However, the visitors seemed to relish the chance to defy expectations.With Fabien Galthie, France's men's coach, backing them from the stands, a rousing rendition of La Marseillaise brought second row Hina Ikahehegi and several of her team-mates to tears.Kildunne killed some of that buzz inside the first five minutes. Showing no ill-effects from her lay-off, the full-back had already beaten three defenders on a jagging kick return, when she was sprung down the blindside a minute later.Quick hands from Cokayne, Alex Matthews, Ward and Hannah Botterman sent Kildunne down the touchline and her quick feet did the rest, burning Konde and cutting inside the covering Kelly Arbey.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Hannah Botterman counted the number of turnovers she had secured in the matchEngland were fortunate, however, that an apparent knock-on from Natasha Hunt at the base of the final ruck escaped the attention of the officials.With Jones and Botterman hoovering up penalties at the breakdown, Ward and Maud Muir putting the brakes on France's rolling maul and Cokyane waving off her opposite number after getting the better of a scrum, England were winning plenty of battles.But still the war turned against them as England's inaccuracy in attack kept France in the contest and their belief growing.Centre Konde dived over to cut the hosts' lead to 7-5 as England's goalline defence was finally stretched thin after Arbey's break down the opposite wing.A spill by Tatyana Heard meant England surrendered a fine attacking platform five out from the French line, but it was Les Bleues who had the better chance to add to the scoreline before the break.With Jess Breach in attendance, Menager just failed to get a pass away to Lea Champon with the line beckoning. The French captain then thought she had crossed herself shortly after, but Carla Arbez's mis-pass drifted forward en route.England's senior leaders, led by Jones, convened a hasty on-pitch conference at the half-time whistle.They used the break well. England emerged sharper for the second half. Abby Dow had already seen a try wiped off for a forward pass by Kildunne, shortly before a shock-and-awe line-out drive, powered by 10 of the team and covering 22m, ended with Cokayne dotting down.France, who fought back from 13 points down to win their quarter-final against Ireland last weekend, stuck in the fight longer than any of England's previous opponents in this World Cup.Arbey crossed after a series of short-range forward thrusts to cut the deficit back to 14-12, but Ward restored England's cushion, burrowing over after Dow had sat down Morgane Bourgeois.Ultimately England were always one step ahead in the second half, with their bench once again giving them the legs on their opponents in the final quarter.However, considering Canada's heroics in dumping out the Black Ferns, the Red Roses may need more next weekend.To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.This video can not be playedMedia caption, 'All we've been dreaming of' - KildunneLine-upsEngland: Kildunne; Dow, Jones, Heard, Breach; Harrison, Hunt; Botterman, Cokayne, Muir, Talling, Ward, Aldcroft (capt), Kabeya, MatthewsReplacements: Atkin-Davies, Clifford, Bern, Galligan, Feaunati, L Packer, Aitchison, RowlandFrance: Bourgeois; Arbey, Konde, Vernier, M Menager (capt); Arbez, Bourdon Sansus; Brosseau, Gerin, Bernadou, Fall Raclot, Ikahehegi, Squire, L Champon, T Feleu.Replacements: Riffonneau, Deshaye, Khalfaoui, Maka, Okemba, A Chambon, Tuy, Boulard.To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.This video can not be playedMedia caption, England's Kildunne 'proved why she's world's best player'Match officialsReferee: Maggie Cogger-Orr (New Zealand)Assistant referees: Clara Munarini (Italy) and Kat Roche (USA)Television match official: Rachel Horton (Australia)Related topicsRugby UnionMore on this storyRugby Union Weekly podcast: England are in the World Cup final!Comments can not be loadedTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browserView comments | 1380Top storiesHow best in the world Dembele finally lived up to his potentialPublished4 hours agoWhy Spain's Bonmati won record third women's Ballon d'OrPublished3 hours agoHampton's rise to best keeper in the worldPublished5 hours agoElsewhere on the BBCYour first look at Alan Partridgeâs 'brave' new projectIs it time to copyright your face?The return of a trippy, comic joyrideHow did a duck help solve this 19th-century murder case?Elsewhere in SportHow best in the world Dembele finally lived up to his potentialWhy Spain's Bonmati won record third women's Ballon d'OrHampton's rise to best keeper in the worldHorner, the Â£52m pay-off, and what next for ex-Red Bull boss?How England 2025 boomed into biggest Women's Rugby World Cup everWhy Friday's opening session is likely to shape Ryder CupWhy do West Ham keep conceding from corners?GB fail to win gold for first time in 20 years - where it went wrongMartinelli snatches late draw for Arsenal against Man City.
