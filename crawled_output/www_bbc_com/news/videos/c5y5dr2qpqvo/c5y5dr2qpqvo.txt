Vast swathes of the city are inundated, with water also entering people's homes in some neighbourhoods. Public transport has been affected and some train services have been suspended indefinitely. Several schools have declared a holiday, while Kolkata's Mayor Firhad Hakim has asked people to stay indoors.
