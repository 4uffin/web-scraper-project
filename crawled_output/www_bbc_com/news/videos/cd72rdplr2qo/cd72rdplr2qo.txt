It was very cool and a very special thing to be able to share."All skydives are special, and the sky is a beautiful place to be, but this one was unique. It was absolutely beautiful and such a rare treat."Laura Hampton, from Skydive Langar, said: "It's really rare - we get to see small ones from the plane but that's never so clear or defined. "This one was definitely special."BBC Weather presenter Kaye Forster said circular rainbows were most commonly seen from aircraft."Rainbows are actually full circles," she said."From our viewpoint, we only get to see an arch as the rest of the rainbow is blocked by the ground."Follow BBC Nottingham on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.
