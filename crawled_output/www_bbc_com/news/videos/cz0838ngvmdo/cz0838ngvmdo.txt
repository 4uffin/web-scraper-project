The local people, I can't thank them enough."Listen to highlights from North Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North.13 September 2025DogsLeedsPateley BridgeShareSaveUK operators 'ready' for new border checks system11 hrs agoEnglandSurrey and Sussex Make a Difference Awards honour local heroes2 days agoEnglandEd Sheeran surprises BBC award-winner and brotherThe superstar promises to send a guitar to 15-year-old Michal and his younger brother Jakob.3 days agoEnglandSir Ed Davey says illegal immigration needs to stop7 days agoEnglandAsylum seekers would have right to work - Davey7 days agoEnglandSpeed record car engine heard again after 90 yearsNational Motor Museum in Beaulieu in Hampshire restored the engine. 8 days agoEnglandUnderwater cameras reveal 'pristine sea-life'Experts say the footage shows "how our waters could look if we give them space and time to recover".8 days agoEngland'Figure skating helped me after stroke as a baby'Special Olympics figure skater Stephanie Gott says she feels "free as a butterfly" while on the ice.8 days agoEnglandPokémon at 30: Fun, fandom and serious financePokémania, after taking the world by storm in the 1990s, is booming almost three decades later.11 Sep 2025EnglandWatch: Driver speeds along pavement to flee policePolice footage captures a man as he mounts the pavement near a school to get away from officers.9 Sep 2025EnglandReform's Andrea Jenkyns sings at party conferenceJenkyns appeared on stage at the NEC in Birmingham, singing her self-written song Insomniac.5 Sep 2025EnglandFirst day of school for girl who had heart transplant"You just can’t take it for granted how lovely that is, just to have a normal milestone."4 Sep 2025EnglandMother of Brianna Ghey calls for smartphone ban in schoolsEsther Ghey has written to the government to call for a statutory ban on phones in schools in a campaign backed by high-profile celebrities. 3 Sep 2025EnglandWatch: Motorcyclist led police on 137mph pursuitThe motorcyclist reached speeds of more than 130mph (210km/h) while uninsured and unlicensed.23 Aug 2025EnglandUnderground rescue team operating without a baseCumbria Ore Mines Rescue Unit teams up with Penrith Mountain Rescue to raise money for a hub.20 Aug 2025EnglandFormer Saints manager on keeping young talentFormer Saints manager Dave Merrington says players have to give everything they can to the fans. 20 Aug 2025EnglandColdplay fan shocked at marriage proposalAmber Hird and Nick Bartrupe, from Halifax, got engaged at the band's gig in Hull on Monday night.19 Aug 2025EnglandCouple's pizza boat solution to stress and anxietyKeith Wraight and Clare Poyser quit their jobs to sell pizza on canals across the West Midlands.16 Aug 2025EnglandMatchday football steward saved a life with CPRDavid Ince says he "wouldn't be here today" if it were not for Paul Harrison and others.11 Aug 2025EnglandOne woman's mission to clean up BritainRuth Major, 80, has picked up more than 100,000 bits of litter since she began her country-wide quest.11 Aug 2025EnglandBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
