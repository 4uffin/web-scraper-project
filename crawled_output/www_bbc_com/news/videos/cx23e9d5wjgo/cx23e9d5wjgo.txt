In an interview with the BBC's Paul Njie, he said the militants had tried to assassinate him five times in the last two years, most recently in March. He insists the group has been weakened. Analysts have, however, pointed to its recent territorial gains as evidence it remains a major threat. President Mohamud also dismissed fears of clashes between Egyptian and Ethiopian peacekeepers in Somalia, saying his country would not become a battleground for regional disputes.1 day agoEgyptSomaliaDonald TrumpAfricaEthiopiaal-ShababShareSaveBBC's Steve Rosenberg attends 'Russia's answer to Eurovision' Vietnam was among 23 countries competing in a glitzy Russian song contest, revived three years after Russia was banned from Eurovision.5 days agoWorldWatch: Moment avalanche is triggered by explosives in New ZealandAuthorities started the controlled avalanche to reduce the risk for drivers to the popular tourist destination Milford Sound.10 Sep 2025WorldWestJet flight from Toronto makes hard landing in the CaribbeanThe airline confirmed that all 164 passengers and crew aboard flight 2276 were safely evacuated.
