Dr Owen Exeter, from the Centre of Ecology and Conservation on the Penryn Campus in Cornwall, said the cameras recorded populations of lobster, small sharks, seals, octopus and bluefin tuna, amongst other smaller species of fish.He said: "The Isles of Scilly is a semi or near pristine environment which can be an example of how our waters could look if we give them space and time to recover.""It is really amazing to see this number of sharks and diversity of fish," he added."Our cameras recorded nearly 12,000 individual animals, from 64 species."The cameras were attached to a rig which was dropped in to the sea using weights and baited with chopped up fish to draw a variety of marine species.Dr Kristian Metcalfe, associate professor in marine conservation science at the university, said the "relatively low-cost camera systems" could be used to improve the monitoring and effectiveness of Marine Protected Areas.Follow BBC Cornwall on X, Facebook and Instagram.
