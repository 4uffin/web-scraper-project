Senator Alejandro Moreno, of the opposition Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), grabbed the president of the Senate, Gerardo Fernández Noroña, demanding to be allowed to speak. After some pushing and shoving, Moreno threw punches and a photographer who stepped in was injured. Tempers had already been running high throughout the debate about the presence of armed forces from other countries on Mexican soil. But it was not until after the national anthem had been sung that Senator Moreno, angry at not having been allowed to speak during the debate, physically clashed with Fernández Noroña. The Senate leader said he would call an emergency session to propose expelling Mr Moreno and three other opposition lawmakers who joined in the fray.28 August 2025MexicoShareSaveWhat you need to know about Bolsonaro's coup prison sentenceThe former president of Brazil has been sentenced to 27 years in prison after being found guilty for plotting a military coup. 5 days agoLatin AmericaSandstorm turns skies bright orange in PeruFootage from Ica shows huge dust clouds. 1 Aug 2025Latin AmericaWatch: Moment people flee church as earthquake interrupts mass in PeruThe 5.6 magnitude earthquake struck near Lima, Peru on Sunday morning, causing panic at the city's cathedral.16 Jun 2025Latin AmericaWatch: Moment Chile earthquake rocks live TV showThe 6.4 magnitude earthquake interrupted the broadcast, shaking the equipment in the studio.7 Jun 2025Latin AmericaWatch: Cat caught smuggling drugs into Costa Rica prisonThe feline was found carrying 235.65g of marijuana and 67.76g of heroin, authorities say.19 May 2025Latin AmericaWatch: Wildlife dyed blue in São Paulo chemical spillCity officials say they are acting to rescue and save the lives of the affected animals. 16 May 2025Latin AmericaWatch: How Lady Gaga's record-breaking concert almost ended in disaster A large-scale bomb attack was thwarted by police before Gaga's first concert in Brazil since 2012. 4 May 2025Latin AmericaDrone footage shows scale of deadly Peru landslideTwo people are killed after a glacial lagoon overflowed in the Ancash region triggering a landslide.30 Apr 2025Latin AmericaWatch: Olympic legend leaves parents in her dust at school sports dayThe third-fastest woman in history, Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, took part in sports day at her son's school in Jamaica.18 Apr 2025Latin AmericaPeru fisherman reunites with brother after 95 days lost at sea16 Mar 2025Latin AmericaWatch: Fisherman reunites with brother after 95 days lost at seaMaximo Napa said he had to resort to eating roaches, birds and turtles to survive.16 Mar 2025Latin AmericaWatch: Man survives being run over by trainSurveillance footage shows the man standing up and walking away after the incident in Lima.9 Mar 2025Latin AmericaMan arrested trying to smuggle cocaine under toupeeSuspect tried to smuggle more than €10,000 of cocaine from Cartagena to Amsterdam, Colombian authorities said.25 Feb 2025Latin AmericaWatch: Moment man vandalises ancient Incan artefactPeruvian police released footage showing a suspect pounding Cusco's 12-Angle Stone.20 Feb 2025Latin AmericaPeruvian policeman in capybara costume makes Valentine's drug bustVideo shows the moment police use fancy dress to carry out a drug raid in Lima, Peru.14 Feb 2025Latin AmericaWatch moment man is swallowed by humpback whaleDell Simancas captures the moment his son, Adrián, is swallowed and spat out by a humpback whale.13 Feb 2025Latin AmericaWorkers rescued from window ledge as fire engulfs Rio clothing factoryAt least 20 people have been injured after a factory making costumes for Carnival celebrations in Brazil caught fire.12 Feb 2025Latin AmericaThousands of baby turtles released in BrazilThe project aims to boost numbers of threatened tracajás turtles in Amazonas state.9 Feb 2025Latin AmericaPlane crashes into bus on busy São Paulo streetTwo people were killed in the accident, the Brazilian city's fire department said.7 Feb 2025Latin AmericaWatch: Argentina canal turns bright red, alarming localsThe body of water runs through industrial areas on the outskirts of Buenos Aires.7 Feb 2025Latin AmericaBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
