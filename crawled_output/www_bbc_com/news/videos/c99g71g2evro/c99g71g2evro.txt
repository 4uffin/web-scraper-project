Ragasa ripped through Philippines' remote northern islands on Monday, killing at least one person before barrelling through Taiwan, Hong Kong and southern China. In Taiwan, at least 17 people have died after a barrier lake burst its banks and as the storm passed near Hong Kong, footage showed the moment water surged through a beachfront luxury hotel. Typhoon Ragasa made landfall in Yangjiang at 17:00 local time (09:00 GMT).Follow this story live here.Video produced by Ian Aikman and Marina Costa.2 days agoAsiaChinaPhilippinesSevere weatherShareSaveMoment sinkhole pulls down power lines in busy Bangkok streetSocial media footage showed the massive crater in Thailand's capital leaving cars teetering on the edge.2 days agoAsiaWatch: Hugs on tarmac as family reunite after Afghan ordealThe couple's family say they are "overwhelmed with gratitude and relief" at their release.6 days agoAsiaWatch: Bear caught on CCTV searching for food in Indian templeThe curious creature ransacked an office in its quest to find tasty treats.16 Sep 2025AsiaSee Kathmandu's destroyed and barricaded streets after violenceThere's an intense military presence on the Nepali capital's streets, says the BBC's Samira Hussain.
