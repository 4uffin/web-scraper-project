An Israeli military spokesman has published new advice for areas within the Strip that residents of Gaza City can go to as operations continue in the city. The social media post recommends 14 locations which people can relocate to "for their protection". Some of the locations mentioned are in central Gaza in an area that has not been declared a "combat zone" or a"humanitarian zone" by Israeli forces. Meanwhile, Palestinian social media channels are reporting that evacuation orders for specific buildings are being issued locally.One such order was reportedly issued for the area around the Safadi tower in the Nasr neighbourhood of Gaza City. We have verified footage showing blasts in close proximity to the tower. Image source, Instagram

Officials in Utah say a series of slogans were carved into bullets found along with the rifle that they say was used to kill Charlie Kirk.The messages appear to be associated with anti-fascist movements.
One round was inscribed with the lyrics: "Bella Ciao, Bella Ciao, Bella Ciao, Ciao, Ciao." The phrase is drawn from the song Belle Ciao, an Italian anthem dedicated to partisan fighters who fought against the occupying Nazi forces during World War 2. It was catapulted back into popular use after it featured in the TV series Money Heist. Another bullet was marked with three down arrows. This image has been associated with socialist groups and their opposition to the Nazi regime in the 1930s, but has more recently been adopted by Antifa - a decentralised movement sometimes associated with violent opposition to far-right and racist groups. "Hey Fascist. Catchâ was also inscribed on another round, officials said.

As we mentioned earlier, when the name Tyler Robinson was first reported by US media we began to investigate the suspectâs online presence.A couple of different images started circulating on social media, supposedly showing the suspect. We ran reverse image searches and put pictures through facial recognition tools, but came up with little. Then I came across a post on X claiming to have located the Facebook page of Tylerâs father. The page itself revealed little but it did feature photos of a man and a woman.Expanding the search, I looked up âRobinsonâ accounts from Utah and found the Facebook profile of a woman which linked to what was said to be Tyler Robinsonâs fatherâs page. Some posts on X claimed this was his mother.Her profile was far more public and it contained multiple images of the suspect who was named in the posts.In one photo, the suspect wore the same Converse trainers as seen in images of the âperson of interestâ released by the FBI.
One comment said: âWe are so proud of you, Tyler!âAnother post on the page showed Tyler Robinsonâs mother wishing her child a happy 19th birthday in 2022, which matches with the age of 22 given by law enforcement officials today.The accountâs owner began deleting images that mentioned Tyler by name shortly after the name began to be reported.Image source, FacebookImage caption, One of the pictures of Tyler Robinson that was posted on his motherâs Facebook page

At BBC Verify we've been digging into social media accounts associated with Tyler Robinson who has been named by the BBC's US partner CBS as the suspect in the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. One Facebook profile that we believe belongs to his mother - which she now appears to be clearing of images of Tyler - suggests the family comes from Cedar City in Utah, around three hours drive from the Utah Valley University where the shooting took place. Her account reveals numerous details about the family's life and includes photos of trips they made - some of which appear to have included visits to gun ranges. Other posts on her profile reveal that Tyler Robinson attended Pineview Middle School. In 2022, he moved to the city of Logan to attended Utah State University - about two hours drive from Utah Valley University. We're still searching for any profiles that belong to Tyler and will bring you more information as we get it.

One element of international law that is repeatedly referenced with regard to the war in Gaza is the âprinciple of proportionatelyâ. I was interested to look into this further.
Working with my BBC Verify colleague Jemimah Herd we first wanted to explain how international law addresses proportionality in warfare. Second, we wanted to document the consequences in Gaza of Israel's military operation.
Third, we wanted to document why the Israeli government and the Israel Defense Forces believe that their actions have been proportionate and in line with international law.
And finally, we wanted to ask a range of international law experts whether they consider Israel's actions to have been proportionate.
In recent weeks, Jemimah and I have set about doing this. Our hope is that we've produced a helpful explanation of how these complex and important aspects of international law relate to what's happening in Gaza.

The Sudanese army, which has been fighting the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in a civil war since 2023, has announced the retaking of the town of Bara in the North Kordofan region of central Sudan - an important gain in its attempt to control more of the country.With the fighting often taking place in remote areas, verifying videos and images posted on social media is an important means of confirming events.We have located several videos showing Sudanese army soldiers and fighters from allied groups at several locations inside the town on Thursday, which is consistent with reports of its recapture.The videos were filmed at a main road junction, outside the town courthouse, and at the main hospital. In some videos, the people filming mention the date as 11 September.Image source, XImage caption, A key commander, Abu Aqla Keikal, seen with other fighters outside a Bara HotelOne video filmed outside a hotel in the town shows a key commander Abu Aqla Keikal - who defected from the RSF last year. His defection enabled the army to take back another part of central Sudan from the RSF. We have matched the buildings and other landmarks we see in the clips to images available on Google Maps and checked previous images of the army commander to the person seen in the video filmed at the hotel.Controlling Bara allows the army the secure the North Kordofan state capital, El-Obeid and control another supply route into central Sudan from the capital, Khartoum, which it took back from the RSF earlier this year.

Image source, EPAThe new Housing Secretary Steve Reed, who replaced Labour Deputy Leader Angela Rayner following her resignation last week, has re-stated the governmentâs pledge to deliver 1.5 million new homes in England by the next election.How achievable is it? The answer is itâs technically possible, but the numbers involved are a very big challenge.Hitting that total over a five-year parliament requires around 300,000 house completions a year â building at a rate not seen since the 1970s. Ministers say output will âramp upâ in the later years.When officials re-calculated how many homes each area needed, external at the end of 2024, they came to a total of 370,000 homes a year. If that level were met in each of the final three years, it would produce just over 1.1 million homes. Add roughly 200,000 homes registered in Labourâs first year â and assuming a similar second year â then on paper the target could be reached.But itâs a challenge. Planning approvals for housing in England fell to a record low last year, with builders report rising brick costs, some councils saying the targets are âunrealisticâ and the Home Builders Federation warning that costs and taxes are climbing.You can see how many homes your area has been told it needs and how many were registered in the last year with BBC Verifyâs housing tracker.
Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingHow reliable are AI-enhanced images of the person of interest?published at 12:54 BST 12 September12:54 BST 12 SeptemberThomas Copeland and Shayan SardarizadehBBC Verify
Some online users have been turning to AI tools in an attempt to enhance the grainy images released by the FBI of the person of interest in the killing of Charlie Kirk. Some of these AI-enhanced images are now being widely shared online, including by users with millions of followers. But experts have told BBC Verify that relying on AI-enhanced tools to uncover key details in images is both "risky" and "wrong".
AI tools are trained on lots of high-quality images, which are then blurred so the technology can learn to predict what a clearer version might look like. So, when you ask an AI tool to unblur an image, it is just making a prediction based on the images it has been trained on, says Prof Thomas Nowotny, head of the AI research group at the University of Sussex. In some of the AI-enhanced versions of the FBI images, the technology has distorted the US flag and eagle design that we previously identified on the black shirt worn by the individual. In others, it has added a moustache to the person of interest.âIf you want to enhance your holiday snaps to be sharper, more colourful and crisper and don't need them to actually reflect reality, it's the perfect tool,â says Nowotny.

Image source, TelegramImage caption, We can't see the explosions in this video posted from Tosno but they can be heardThis morning we are looking into reports of a major drone attack on Russia during the night.The defence ministry in Moscow said it intercepted 221 Ukrainian drones. In one video from the town of Tosno in the Leningrad region that we have verified, multiple explosions can be heard although it is unclear what is being targeted.Around 100 miles to the north, in the port town of Primorsk, fires were extinguished on a vessel and at a pumping station, according to regional governor Alexander Drozdenko. As yet, we have been unable to confirm these reports.The scale of the drone attack on Russia is notable, particularly as today marks the start of military exercises involving Russian and Belarusian forces in the Baltic and Barents seas.Phase one of the exercises â dubbed Zapad (West) - will model responses to attacks on the two countries.
