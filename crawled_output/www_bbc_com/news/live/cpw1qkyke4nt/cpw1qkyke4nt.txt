Britain, Canada and Australia have jumped on what may be the last
train to a Palestinian state.But their train is very late.And their recognition has arrived at a moment when it has never seemed so out of reach.Its expected territory is now disappearing at a faster pace than
ever before. Gaza has been all but razed to the ground, as calls intensify from
Israeli ministers to push the Palestinians out to redevelop this "real estate".The occupied West Bank is now all but formally annexed. Israel is
now threatening to make that official and Jewish settlements are expanding at
an unprecedented pace.And Palestinian leadership has been weakened, by Israel, and from
within.Still, even at this eleventh hour, this move by three more Western
governments sends an important signal.Symbols matter in diplomacy and they matter
to Palestinians
- even if this recognition comes decades after a majority
of the worldâs countries took a stand.

Image source, XWe've had several countries - the UK, Canada and Australia - all formally recognise a Palestinian state today. More countries, as we explained earlier, are expected to follow suit this week when leaders gather at the UN General Assembly in New York. We're soon going to pause our live coverage, but here's what else you need to know:
UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said recognition of a Palestinian state was needed to "revive the hope of peace and a two-state solution" - but stressed that this was not a reward for Hamas
Reacting to the announcements, Netanyahu accused the leaders of the UK, Canada and Australia of "giving a huge reward to terrorism" - he added that "there will be no Palestinian state"
In domestic politics, the move has been welcomed by some politicians - Lib Dem leader Ed Davey called it a "great step forward", while the Green Party said it was "important" but had arrived too late
The opposition offered a much fiercer criticism, with Tory leader Kemi Badenoch saying Starmer's position is "absolutely disastrous" and will leave "hostages languishing in Gaza"
In the occupied West Bank, some Palestinians have expressed hope, while those in Gaza say they don't think things on the ground will change
Meanwhile, some families of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza have strongly opposed the UK's decision, saying the move has "dramatically complicated efforts to bring home our loved ones"

When Keir Starmer announced his intentions to recognise Palestinian statehood back in July, he also said the UK would only do so unless Israel met five conditions:
Take substantive steps to end the âappallingâ situation in Gaza
Allow the UN to restart the supply of aid
Agree to a ceasefire
Rule out annexation of the West Bank
Commit to a long-term peace process that revives the prospect of a two-state solution
Since then, Israel has launched an offensive on Gaza City, while a UN-backed body has declared famine there - with UN agencies saying Israel was systematically obstructing aid. It has also attempted to assassinate Hamasâs leadership as they discussed a ceasefire proposal in Doha, ending hopes of an imminent truce.At the same time, the Israeli government has given final approval to the controversial E1 settlement project - which would effectively split the West Bank in two, dividing the Palestinian populations in its north and south
- and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich has floated a proposal to annex around 82% of the territory. And then last week, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared: "We are going to fulfil our promise that there will be no Palestinian state. This place belongs to us."On every front, Netanyahu's government appears to have moved further away from Starmerâs conditions.Image source, ReutersImage caption, Smotrich unveiled plans for the E1 settlement project in August

One of the factors behind this decision was the domestic political pressure on Keir Starmer to act. The Green Party, which has attracted some voters who - angered by the pictures from Gaza - want the prime minister to take a firmer stance to Israel, has now called for an end to arms sales to Israel., externalBut that's not just a call Labour's political opponents are making. Already some Labour MPs - not on the hard-left of the party typically hostile to Starmer - have argued the same. Dr Simon Opher, a Labour MP blocked by Israel from entering the country this week, said the government had tried to use the threat of recognition as leverage to achieve a ceasefire but it had not worked. "Now we have to very categorically opt out of any arms deals with Israel, stop any cooperation, and we need to think about proper trade sanctions," he tells me, adding that would be "the next logical step". Other Labour MPs fear the move panders to the party's left, and has not achieved anything. "It feeds into the narrative that the government cares more about Palestinian flags than Union flags," another Labour MP says.
"It gives the impression we care more about borders in the Middle East than the borders at Dover."

Hamas, which the UK and many other nations have designated as a terrorist organisation, has welcomed the news that the UK, Canada and Australia have all formally recognised a Palestinian state.In a statement, the armed group and political movement in Gaza says: "This recognition is an important step in affirming the right of our Palestinian people to their land and holy sites, and to establish their independent state with Jerusalem as its capital."But it adds that the move "must be accompanied by practical measures" that would lead to an "immediate end" to the war in Gaza and "confront" settlement plans in the West Bank. It also calls on the international community and the UN to "cease all forms of co-operation and co-ordination" with Israel. A reminder: When announcing the UK's plans to recognise a Palestinian state earlier, Keir Starmer stressed that his decision was not a reward for Hamas and that his call for a two-state solution was "the exact opposite of their hateful vision".

Palestinian activists have voiced sadness over the decision by the UK, Canada and Australia to recognise the Palestinian state, as Israel presses ahead with its military operation in Gaza City and signals plans to annex parts of the West Bank.
Imad al-Maghrebi from Gaza, who currently lives in Istanbul, describes the move as "a historic moment, but it has come far too late" - adding: "In reality, nothing remains of Palestine except its people and they too are facing genocide Israel has destroyed any possibility of establishing an independent, sovereign state."
Alaa Saleh, a father of six who fled from northern Gaza to the south, tells me: "These countries must put pressure on Israel to end the war. Recognition is important and positive, but it will be meaningless without stopping the fighting."
Hiyam Hassan, a Palestinian activist on Facebook, is more scathing. She argues that the recognition "carries no real value at this moment, when a rogue state is devouring vast areas of the promised land and, through its expansionist practices, undermining the very foundations of a Palestinian state before it is even born".
She adds that the step brings no real benefit to Palestinians themselves, who in her view "should reconsider their position on the two-state solution after all that has happened and after all the violations committed by Israel since the Oslo Accords".Hassan says the recognition mainly serves the governments that issued it "to appease their own people who have taken to the streets en masse to oppose the genocide in Gaza"."What is puzzling,â she concludes, "is that many including Palestinians under the threat of extermination are celebrating this recognition, which merely masks governmentsâ failure and inability once again to confront the ongoing genocide".

Reaction from other political figures inside Israel has been a mix of anger and disappointment.Two of the most hardline figures in Netanyahu's government, National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, have responded by calling for Israel to assert âsovereigntyâ over the West Bank. The pair, who are both ultranationalists who live in West Bank settlements, have previously been sanctioned by the UK for inciting violence against Palestinians. On the other side of Israelâs parliament, opposition leader Yair Lapid says the UK and others have made âa bad stepâ but lays the blame with Netanyahu, saying âa functioning Israeli government could have prevented thisâ. âThe government that brought upon us the terrible security disaster in our history is now bringing upon us also the most severe diplomatic crisis ever,â he wrote on X. Yair Golan, leader of the Democrats party, said: "Unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state is a grave political failure by Netanyahu and Smotrich, and a destructive move for Israel's security."

A Palestinian state will not be established west of the Jordan River."Netanyahu says that "for years" he has prevented the establishment of "this terrorist state" in the face of pressure. "Indeed, we doubled Jewish settlement in Judea and Samaria - and we will continue on this path," he adds.The Israeli leader also says a "response to the latest attempt to impose a terrorist state on us in the heart of our country" will be given after he returns from the US, where he will attend the UN General Assembly in New York this week.

Adam says Starmer's move is a "betrayal."We've recently received a statement from Adam Maâanit, whose cousin Tsachi Idan was held hostage by Hamas in Gaza. Idan was one of four dead Israeli hostages whose bodies were handed over by Hamas in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners back in February.Reacting to Keir Starmer's announcement from a few hours ago, he tells me it feels like "nothing less than a betrayal" of the hostages and their families."Instead of using Britainâs influence to force Hamas to release the 48 hostages... it rewards Hamas with exactly what they call the âfruits of October 7â."For context: There are 48 hostages still being held by Hamas in Gaza, 20 of whom are thought to be alive.Another relative, the brother-in-law of one of the Israeli hostages still being held in Gaza, also condemns the move. The UK has given Hamas "the greatest prize â an unconditional recognition of statehood", Moshe Emilio Lavi tells me.The recognition comes while the Israeli hostages "are being starved, tortured, and used as human shields" in Gaza, Lavi says.

Apart from the UK, a number of countries have said they will - or are considering - recognising a Palestinian state. Hereâs a look at whoâs on that list.Franceâs President Emmanuel Macron earlier this year became the first G7 leader to say their country would officially recognise a Palestinian state.Canada announced its recognition today, with Prime Minister Mark Carney, saying "Canada does so as part of a co-ordinated international effort to preserve the possibility of a two-state solution".Australia also recognised a Palestinian state today, with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese saying he's received restated commitments from the Palestinian Authority (PA) that it will continue to recognise Israel's right to exist.Portugal is preparing to shift policy, announcing on Saturday that it will recognise a Palestinian state this weekend.New Zealand has also been considering recognition, but PM Christopher Luxon has said the decision will not be disclosed until next week.Around three quarters of the UN's 193 members already recognise a Palestinian state - take a look:
Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingThe two-state solution - in briefpublished at 15:58 BST 21 September15:58 BST 21 September
The two-state solution is an internationally backed formula for peace between Israel and the Palestinians.It proposes an independent Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza, with East Jerusalem as its capital. It would exist alongside Israel.Israel rejects a two-state solution. It says any final settlement must be the result of negotiations with the Palestinians, and statehood should not be a precondition.The Palestinian Authority - set up in the wake of peace agreements in the 1990s - backs a two-state solution but Hamas does not because it is opposed to the existence of Israel.Hamas says that it could accept an interim Palestinian state based on 1967 de facto borders, without officially recognising Israel, if refugees were given the right to return.Earlier efforts to settle the conflict saw Israel and Palestinian leaders sign a deal called the Oslo Peace Accords, in 1993. This was intended to provide a framework for peace talks. However, talks eventually collapsed with each side blaming the other.

For years, successive British governments - both Conservative and Labour - have hoarded Palestinian recognition in their diplomatic coffers. This was a great prize to be deployed only as peace beckoned in the Middle East, a negotiating tool to help lever a political settlement finally over the line. But that strategy now is history.Instead, PM Keir Starmer is playing the recognition card for an utterly different purpose: to keep an idea alive - an idea that peace can come to the region only with a Palestinian state alongside an Israeli state. That idea, western diplomats say, is now at risk of destruction at the hands of Benjamin Netanyahuâs government, as more Israeli settlers fill the occupied territories, plans to divide the West Bank from East Jerusalem are agreed and calls for partial annexation grow among far-right politicians. The hope among the newly recognising nations is that Israel and its allies realise that a two-state solution - however remote and difficult it may seem - is ultimately the only way to achieve peace in the long term. If we donât do this now, one diplomat said, thereâll be nothing left to recognise.

It would be disingenuous to pretend domestic politics, including pressure from within the Labour Party, was not a factor in this decision. Thatâs the view of Foreign Office officials Iâve been speaking to in the last few days building up to this decision.Recognition of a Palestinian state has long been a Labour manifesto promise.But the prime minister has been criticised by many Labour activists, and particularly Muslim voters who had long backed Labour, for his stance on the war in Gaza. In the eyes of many pro-Palestinian voters, Starmerâs original sin was in a 2023 LBC interview shortly after the 7 October Hamas attacks, when as leader of the opposition he appeared to say Israel had the "right" to cut off water and energy to Gaza.Officials in Downing Street argue since they came to power Labour has made significant changes, like sanctioning some Israeli ministers, suspending some arms exports and now recognising a Palestinian state.But party strategists say they are not getting credit in the polls for these changes and fear they have permanently lost voters for whom the situation in Gaza is a major concern.In the build up to the announcement in July that set the UK on this path, cabinet ministers had been pressing for a change and more than half of Labourâs MPs had signed a letter calling for immediate recognition of a Palestinian state.Read more analysis of why Starmer decided the time was right to recognise a Palestinian state.

Patel adds that while Hamas is still holding hostages in Gaza, the move sends a "dangerous message, where violence and extremism are tolerated and rewarded".âHis feeble last-minute attempts to appease the United States are shallow and will never justify his reckless decision on recognition," she adds.
