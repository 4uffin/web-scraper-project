Image source, EPA/Shutterstock"We can no longer wait," French President Emmanuel Macron told the UN today, as he announced that France was joining countries including the UK, Canada and Australia in formally recognising a Palestinian state.We've got a summary of the afternoon's key speeches in New York, where Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas looked towards a future in Gaza without Hamas, and UN chief Antonio Guterres added that statehood for Palestinians "is a right and not a reward".Israel, though, maintains that there will be no two-state solution, and did not take part in today's speech-making on the issue - our diplomatic correspondent has more on how Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's doesn't appear to mind his country's isolation on the international stage.Netanyahu was also warned by Guterres not to respond by annexing more parts of the West Bank, but Israel's UN ambassador says this will be a discussion for the Israeli government when Netanyahu returns from an upcoming White House trip. Donald Trump's administration, too, declined to speak, though the US president will be present in New York tomorrow when the UN's General Assembly marks the 80th anniversary of the founding of the organisation.That brings an end to our live coverage, but we'll keep our news story updated with any developments.And you can go deeper with these pieces:

With the recognition of Palestinian statehood among some of Israelâs traditional allies, and moves to impose a variety of economic, political and cultural boycotts, Israelâs international isolation is deepening.But itâs not clear that the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu minds.A week ago, he called for Israel to embrace an economy with "autarkic characteristics" - in other words, increased self-sufficiency."Israel is in a sort of isolation," he told a conference in Jerusalem. The way to respond, he said, was to become a "super-Sparta" - a reference to the ancient Greek city state famed for its discipline and military prowess."Thereâs no choice," Netanyahu said. "In the coming years, at least, we will have to deal with these attempts to isolate us."His remarks have some Israelis wondering what the prime minister will do next."It certainly looks like he is gearing up for a move like West Bank annexation," columnist and former intelligence officer Yossi
Alpher writes today."Along with prolonged war in Gaza, that will trigger boycotts and severance of relations."

Image source, Getty ImagesWhile the UN meeting on the two-state solution continues, let's have a quick recap of the key lines we heard from some of the biggest names in attendance in New York.
Announcing France's recognition of a Palestinian state, Macron told the UN that "nothing justifies the ongoing war" in Gaza
But he stressed that giving Palestinians rights does not take away from the rights of the Israelis
UN chief Antonio Guterres also warned Israel not to respond with an annexation of the West Bank, suggesting that "the relentless expansion of settlements" in the region must stop
Statehood for Palestinians "is a right and not a reward", he added
Joining the conference remotely, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called for Hamas to surrender its weapons as he looked ahead to a future for Gaza that, he said, would not include Hamas

Image source, ReutersAs I was preparing for my live broadcast from outside the Palestinian Mission in London, a British man in his mid-50s stopped me. He was walking his dog in a nearby neighbourhood and came on foot to take pictures of the building, above which the Palestinian flag is now flying.He told me he had come here to take some photos to send to his son, who had participated in the pro-Palestinian demonstrations over the past two years.Less than 24 hours after the UK recognised the Palestinian state, the Palestinian diplomatic mission in London started the celebrations. The Palestinian flag was raised over the building, the Palestinian national anthem was played, and Palestinian Ambassador Husam Zomlot shared with journalists a sign reading: "Embassy of the State of Palestine.""The mistakes of the past are now being rectified," Zomlot says. "After a century of denial, the British government is taking the step of recognising the State of Palestine," he adds.

Image source, ReutersWe've also heard remarks from Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who speaks remotely after being denied visa access to attend the meeting in New York. Abbas calls for a permanent ceasefire and ensuring access to humanitarian aid through the UN and Unrwa. He also calls for the start "without delay" of the reconstruction of Gaza and the West Bank. Hamas will have no role in governing Gaza, he says, before calling for the group to "surrender their weapons" to the Palestinian authority. "What we want is one unified state without weapons," he explains. Within three months of the end of the war, Abbas says, an interim constitution will be drafted to ensure the correct transfer of power takes place.Elections will then be held under international observance, he adds, describing his aspirations for a state governed by the rule of law. Abbas then commends the 149 nations which have already recognised a Palestinian state, and calls on those which have not done so to follow suit.He also expresses his readiness to work with US President Donald Trump, Saudi Arabia, and other partners to implement any peace plan adopted during the UN conference.

Guterres says nothing can justify "the relentless expansion of settlements" in the West Bank.This must stop, he warns, as well as the "creeping threat of annexation" and the "intensification of settler violence". The UN chief says the only solution is one in which two independent and sovereign states are mutually recognised and fully integrated into the international community.Statehood for the Palestinians "is a right, not a reward," he emphasises, adding: "Denying statehood would be a gift to extremists everywhere."

He says France will only open an embassy to a Palestinian state when all the hostages being held by Hamas are released and a ceasefire has been agreed to.

rule out plans for Israel to annex parts of the West Bank in response to countries
recognising a state of Palestine.Asked about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's response,
Dannon says this will not be decided now.Instead, Netanyahu will first fly to the White House to meet
with Donald Trump, before returning to Israel "to decide what the actions
will be", the ambassador says."In the past we applied sovereignty in the Golan
Heights, over East Jerusalem, but that's a discussion for the government."Pressed further on whether this might mean Israel will annex
parts of the West Bank, Danon says: "I don't like the word annexation, I
call it applying sovereignty.""I think it's a decision that the government will have
to discuss," he says.

"He believes these decisions are more talk and not enough action from our allies."

We're now hearing from Israel's UN ambassador.Danny Danon confirms its delegation won't participate in talks tomorrow, a day which will be dominated by discussions about the situation in the Middle East.He says Israel had requested the session be moved because it falls on Rosh Hashanah, a holy day marking the Jewish New Year. Writing on X, he says: "Despite our prior notice that the session falls on Rosh Hashanah, the Council chose to hold the debate precisely on this day. "A one-sided discussion held on a Jewish holiday is yet more proof of the UNâs hypocrisy."

Emily Damari, a British-Israeli woman who was held hostage by Hamas for 15 months, said the UK government's decision to recognise a Palestinian state was "rewarding monsters", adding: "Shame on you". She shared the message on Instagram alongside pictures of Hamas gunmen during the 7 October attack and an image of Eli Sharabi, an Israeli hostage who was visibly emaciated when he was finally released from captivity in February. Ian Brisley, Eli Sharabi's British brother-in-law, also condemned the recognition. His sister Lianne was murdered on 7 October alongside her daughters Noiya and Yahel. He said it would "send a signal" that "mass murder will be excused - even rewarded". Writing about his sister's murder on social media, he said: "As she lay dead, Gazan 'civilians' who followed the terrorists into kibbutz communities prised the rings from her fingers. "And now Britain is asked to recognise a Palestinian state? It is an insult to their memory, and to every victim of that day."

Image source, Albert Llop/NurPhoto via Getty ImagesImage caption, The Global Sumud Flotilla set sail from Barcelona towards Gaza on 31 AugustIsrael says it won't allow a flotilla carrying aid to Gaza,
accusing the Global Sumud Flotilla of being run by Hamas and
"intended to serve Hamas"."If the flotilla participants' genuine wish is to
deliver humanitarian aid rather than serve Hamas, Israel calls on the vessels
to dock at the Ashkelon Marina and unload the aid there, from where it will be
transferred promptly in a coordinated manner to the Gaza Strip," a foreign
ministry statement says.According to its website, the Global Sumud Flotilla is a
"coalition of everyday peopleâorganisers, humanitarians, doctors, artists,
clergy, lawyers, and seafarers".Flotilla organisers have said the aim of their mission is to
break what they call "Israel's illegal siege on Gaza". They say there are
currently 51 GSF vessels on their way to Gaza.Last month, a UN-backed body confirmed that there was famine in Gaza and the UN's humanitarian chief said it was the direct result of Israel's "systematic obstruction" of aid entering Gaza.The report was labelled an "outright lie" by Israel, which has denied there is starvation in the territory.In June, Israeli forces boarded a boat carrying humanitarian aid to Gaza and detained the 12 activists onboard, including Swedish activist Thunberg.
