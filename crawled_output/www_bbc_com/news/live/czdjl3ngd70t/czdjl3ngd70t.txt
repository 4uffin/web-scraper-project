Image source, EPA/ShutterstockImage caption, Carrie Coon was among the White Lotus stars to be nominated in the best supporting actress in a drama series categoryAhead of Sunday night's ceremony, several news and entertainment publications made predictions about who they thought would take home the awards.These were almost unanimous and correct for some awards. Noah Wyle won outstanding lead actor in a drama series, Jean Smart won outstanding lead actress in a comedy series for Hacks and Seth Rogan won outstanding lead actor in a comedy series.However, there were others where the Emmy clairvoyants were slightly off the mark. The third season of the White Lotus was expected to do well, with four of the seven nominees in the category of best supporting actress in a drama series, and three of the seven nominees in the equivalent men's category being from the show. But Katherine LaNasa and Tramell Tillman ended up taking home the awards - the former for The Pitt and the latter for Severance.Image source, EPAImage caption, The moment Adolescence actor Stephen Graham accepted an Emmy AwardColin Farrell was tipped by some to win the award for best supporting actor in a limited series or movie for The Penguin but was beaten by Stephen Graham, as was Harrison Ford, nominated for best comedy supporting actor for his role in Shrinking. He was beaten by Somebody Somewhere actor Jeff Hiller.There were also some predictions that Severance would beat The Pitt for the outstanding drama series award but it was not to be.

Image source, EPAImage caption, Owen Cooper was joined with his parents off-stageMany truly great works of art over the years have been shot in one take - from World War One epic 1917 to the Spice Girls' music video for Wannabe.But a lot of the most famous examples - including that '90s girlband masterpiece - weren't actually shot continuously in real life. They instead simply used some clever editing to made it look like they had been.One of the many notable things about Netflix's Adolescence, which has just won several top prizes at the Emmy Awards, was that all four of its hour-long episodes really did involve filming everything in one go, without interruption.It's a shooting technique which was widely praised for making the viewing experience more gripping and immersive when the series was released to huge acclaim in March.Image source, NetflixImage caption, The third episode, which saw Jamie speak to a child psychologist, was praised as the standout of the seriesAudiences were instantly drawn in to the show's bracing depiction of a teenage boy who is accused of stabbing a female classmate. But the series was far more than another procedural crime drama.Its exploration of the impact of smartphones and social media on teenagers captured the zeitgeist, tapping into the fears of parents around the world.The drama's breakout star was Owen Cooper, a Warrington-born actor who was only 14 when the series was filmed.Cooper played the central character, Jamie Miller, a schoolboy who is abruptly woken up by the police storming his house in the show's first episode.

Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Comedian Nate Bargatze was this year's Emmys hostThe Emmys ceremony unusually ran broadly on schedule, ending only a few minutes late.That was party due to a clever policy employed by host Nate Bargatze, who started the night by saying a $100,000 (Â£73,756) donation he was making to charity would be reduced for every speech that went over the time limit, while every short speech would add more money to the fund."I know, it's brutal," he said. "This is a game I've made up and these are rules." If anyone's speech went on for longer than 45 seconds, Bargatze said he would deduct $1,000 away from the total amount being donated.But despite the amount of money going up and down throughout the night, the ceremony ended with him and broadcast network CBS announcing they would, in fact, donate $250,000 (Â£184,388) in total to US charity The Boys & Girls Clubs of America.

But what won it sweeping critical acclaim was its exploration of social media-fuelled misogyny among teenage boys.And Cooper, who plays the young suspect Jamie, delivers what critics described as an "astonishing" and "truly remarkable performance".In a Netflix interview, casting director Shaheen Baig recalled seeing Owen's improvised tape and thinking: "He looks great on camera, but also his improv was really smart. It felt very natural."Cooper first became interested in acting at around the age of 10. He attended weekly acting classes for two years in Didsbury, Manchester - though until Adolescence he did not have any TV or film credits to his name.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Cooper with his parents, Noreen and Andy"I asked my mum and dad if I could start going to drama classes, and I think they were a bit shocked by it because I've always wanted to become a footballer," he said in a Netflix interview.Cooper broke the record previously held by Scott Jacoby, who was 16 years old when he won an Emmy in 1973 for That Certain Summer.Read more about Owen Cooper's journey here.

inspire this generation" to do that work."And that was the audience we played the show for. That was the first audience that responded with and it was their word of mouth."Joe Sachs, the show's writer and producer, says "we hear time and time again emergency workers saying 'we feel seen'"."There are people who've had post-traumatic stress from Covid who never realised it, who said, 'Wow, I'm getting help now because of you,'" he says.
