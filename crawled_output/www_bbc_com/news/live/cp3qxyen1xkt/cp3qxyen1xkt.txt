Donald Trump has just finished speaking - after an address that ran on well over the US president's allocated 15 minutes. Stick with us for reaction and analysis as we unpick what was said on climate change, immigration and global affairs, including Ukraine and Gaza, in Trump's nearly hour-long speech.

Trump urges world leaders to protect free speech, and religious liberty, including for Christianity, which he claims is the "most persecuted religion".He is now summing up his speech, about 50 minutes after he started. He returns to earlier topics on immigration and renewable energy sources which he says "destroying a large part of the free world."

Back on the subject of tariffs, Trump says that the sweeping levies his administration has put on Brazil are in response to the country's "unprecedented efforts to interfere" with the rights of Americans. Trump then says that he walked past Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva on his way into the chamber a few minutes ago.According to Trump, the two embraced, and he asked Lula "Can you believe Iâm going to be saying this in just two minutes?"The two leaders have a plan to meet next week, he adds.

A few minutes ago, we told you about Trump's reference to US strikes on alleged Venezuelan drug boats in international waters.I can clearly see the Venezuelan delegation from where I am sitting - and was keen to observe their reaction as Trump singled them out for a mention when he spoke about drug trafficking, gangs and crime. The US has on several recent occasions struck boats alleged to be carrying drugs from Venezuela, prompting strong protests from the government of Nicolas Maduro and a mobilization of the country's militia. The delegates here in New York, however, do not seem particularly concerned. There was very little visible reaction from them, and one appeared to be scrolling through his phone as Trump spoke of his country. The Maduro government in a 6 September letter reached out to the Trump administration, offering to have a "direct and frank" conversation with him over the drug claims. Trump's comments appear to suggest he is not interested in those overtures.

Trump also touches on a frequent subject of his recent speeches - crime.Washington DC is now "a totally safe city again" he says. He credits his bringing in of the National Guard, a decision which was "not politically correct", but did the job, he says.He speaks at length about crime in the US capital, but jumps around a few other domestic and international issues, including oil in the North Sea and Scottish pipelines.

Trump is now saying global warming is not a legitimate idea, calling climate change the ''greatest con job ever perpetrated in the world." "No more global warming, no more global cooling'' he says.All these climate change predictions made by the UN and others ''were wrong'' and made by ''stupid people''.Get away from the ''green scam'' - referring to climate policies - or your country ''will fail,'' he tells the gathered world leaders. "And I'm really good at predicting things," he says.

Image source, ReutersâEurope is in serious troubleâ, says President Trump. He
says "illegal aliens are pouring inâ and says they are doing âabsolutely
nothing about it" - putting it down to a need to be 'politically correct'. He hits out at the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, who he calls a "terrible mayor". He says "they want to go to Sharia law", referencing Islam's legal system."You are in a different country, you canât do that," Trump
says.For context, Khan has not announced any plans to bring London under Sharia Law. It is unclear what Trump is referencing.Trump continues by saying, "the immigration and their suicidal energy ideas will be
the death of western Europe if something is not done immediately".

Trump, who has now passed the 30-minute mark of his 15-minute slot, is now talking about designating drug cartels as "foreign terrorist organisations". He says "people don't like taking big loads of drugs in boats anymore,"
referencing recent US strikes on alleged drug vessels in international waters. Brazil's Luiz Inacio Lula da Silvia appeared to reference this earlier, saying "using lethal force in situations that do not constitute armed conflict is like executing people without trial".

Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky is paying rapt attention to Trump's remarks.As Trump spoke of the bloody conflict raging in his country, I saw him nodding his head silently, dressed in black.The man next to him - whose face I can't see clearly from my vantage point - was whispering to him during parts of Trump's remarks.As a reminder, Trump and Zelensky are expected to meet later today, and the Ukrainian leader will be hoping to hear firm commitments from Trump on next steps by the US to support Ukraine, such as the powerful sanctions the US president just mentioned.Trump so far sounds non-committal, insisting that other countries do the same. For those that buy Russian oil, this is a complicated proposition.Trump has moved onto immigration - political movements in Europe and elsewhere calling for harsher new immigration controls will be bolstered to hear his comments.Image source, Getty Images

Trump tells the assembly members it's time to end the ''failed experiment of open borders'' . He says ''your countries are going to hell''. Earlier he said almost 50% of inmates in German prisons were foreign nationals, and 53% in Austria, 54% in Greece, and 72% in "beautiful Switzerland".We will look into these figures and bring you more information about what data Trump is citing.

Trump, who has been speaking now for more than the allotted 15 minutes, claims the UN is funding an assault on Western countries and their borders, accusing the world body of giving cash cards to migrants coming to the United States southern border."The UN is supposed to stop invasions, not create them and not finance them," he says.

The US president next moves onto biological weapons. If used, "the world might literally come to an end", he says - and condemns research into bio-weapons and man-made pathogens as "unbelievably dangerous".He then announces that the US will pioneer an AI verification system to tackle how countries approach bio-weapons, which he says he hopes the UN will play a "constructive" role in - but he doesn't elaborate on how this system will work.
Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingSome UN delegates visibly squirming as Trump speakspublished at 15:40 BST15:40 BSTBernd Debusmann JrReporting from New York
I listen to Donald Trump speak quite a bit - often multiple times per day as part of my work reporting on the White House.Trump's speech, so far, has touched on many of the same points he makes in most public appearances: the US economy, immigration and thinly veiled swipes at his predecessor Joe Biden.His comments on immigration, in which he vowed to send migrants back to where they come from, to jail or to "somewhere else", was particularly strongly worded and elicited seemingly nervous laughter from the UN delegates.His claim to have stopped multiple "un-endable wars" is also one he makes often, and are particularly notable in that he made no mention of the UN or its historical role in peace-building."It's too bad I have to do these things instead of the United Nations," he said.There are only sparse laughs and applause from those in attendance. A few were visibly squirming in their seats, and a few swivelled in their seats to take selfies with the president in the background.The crux of his speech, it seems, is his view that the UN is something of an outdated relic for which Trump and the US government have little time.

Trump talks about Nato countries, some of which he says have "not cut off" Russian energy products. He says, through doing this, they are "funding the war against themselves". He calls this "embarrassing".The US is prepared to impose "a very strong round of powerful tariffs" on Russia if it is not ready to make a deal to end the war, Trump says.But for this to be effective, European nations need to join the US in "adopting the exact same measures", he adds."Europe has to step it up," he says.

Trump says the families of the Israeli hostages want the dead bodies of hostages taken by Hamas to be returned, every bit as much as if they were alive. He then pivots to talk about the ''killing in Ukraine''. Trump says he thought it would be the easiest conflict to solve because of his relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, which had always been ''a good one.''"In war, you don't know what's going to happen, there are always lots of surprises, both good and bad," he says. He says it was ''supposed to be a quick little skirmish'', and the fact of its protracted length makes Russia look bad, not good.
Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingTrump's frustration at the UN building reflects his wider complaintspublished at 15:37 BST15:37 BSTBernd Debusmann JrReporting from New York
Trump has long had gripes about the UN building, which he outlined just a few minutes ago in his speech.In 2012, he famously said that the "cheap" tiles near the podium "bothered him." At one point, he even offered to help renovate the building - which the global body rejected - prompting him to complain that the UN doesn't "know what it wants". His more recent complaints - such as being stuck on an escalator - are, clearly, indicative of wider issues he has with the organisation. The seating at the event is also indicative of a world that is very different than was the case even last year. Just two rows up from Marco Rubio and new UN ambassador Mike Waltz is sitting Syrian President Ahmed Al Sharaa - a man once wanted by the US for ties to militant groups and whom some UN member countries still sanction.

Trump says he has been involved in trying to get a ceasefire in Gaza and that the negotiating parties "have to get it done". He brings up the fact that several powerful countries have in recent days recognised a Palestinian state. Trump says "this would be a reward" for Hamas's atrocities. Instead of giving in to Hamas's ransom demands, Trump says that those who want peace should be united in one message: to release the hostages now. That line receives applause in the room.Image source, Reuters

He says Iran, which he calls the world's leading "sponsor of terror", cannot be allowed to possess the most dangerous weapon, a reference to the country's nuclear programme. Iran's ambassadors are shown listening to Trump's comments inside the General Assembly, showing now reactions to Trump's comments.Trump then outlines how he ordered bombs to be dropped on Iran's key nuclear facility earlier this year."We did something that for 22 years people wanted to do."

Trump now tells the chamber that he had put a bid in several years ago - when he was a property developer - to remodel the United Nations building. The UN "decided to go in a different direction", which produced a "far inferior product" he says.Referencing his troubles with the escalator today again, he adds that the organisation "did not even get the marble floors I promised them". Continuing, he asks if the UN is able to play a "productive role" in world affairs.
