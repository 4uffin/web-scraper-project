Weâre about to end our BBC Verify Live coverage after a busy week of fact-checking and verification work, thanks for joining us.Today, weâve continued to use satellite imagery to track and gather information about the Israeli militaryâs ongoing ground offensive in Gaza City. Our analysis of these images showed that several camps for displaced people had been dismantled as people continue to evacuate Gazaâs largest city.The team also verified multiple aerial strikes from Ukraine on an army logistics hub inside Russia, as well as a deadly strike on worshippers in a mosque in the besieged Sudanese city of El-Fasher. And as President Donald Trump returned home from his UK state visit, we fact-checked a claim he made on Air Force One about crime in London under Mayor Sadiq Khan. You can watch a video where we assess this claim on the BBCâs social media accounts later. Over the weekend, our colleagues will continue to monitor developments in Gaza and Ukraine to better inform the BBCâs coverage - and our regular live page will return on Monday.

An Eritrean man who arrived in the UK by small boat was able to temporarily block his removal to France under the governmentâs new âone in one outâ scheme because his lawyers argued he needed more time to present evidence he may have been the victim of modern slavery.People are referred for support as potential victims of modern slavery through a process known as the National Referral Mechanism (NRM).Modern slavery can include human trafficking and forced labour - and any potential victims of these crimes can receive support, regardless of nationality or immigration status. A referral to the NRM allows migrants subject to a removal from the UK to remain until after a decision is made.Recent Home Office figures show that only a small proportion of small boat arrivals have been referred into the NRM, external.Fewer than 10% of people who arrived on small boats were referred into the NRM between January and September 2022, a similar proportion to the year before. However, the proportion increases among small boat migrants who were detained for removal from the UK. Of the 1,305 people detained in the same period, 65% were referred into the NRM. The number and proportion of people referred to the NRM while waiting to be removed has been rising in recent years.The Home Office has said this trend âsuggests that the prospect of having to leave the UK may act as a trigger for people to raise issues related to modern slavery, or that enforcement processes may help first responders identify potential victimsâ.

We have been investigating video footage appearing to show the aftermath of a drone strike on a mosque in el-Fasher, the capital of North Darfur in Sudan.El-Fasher has been under siege by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) for 15 months, as it tries to seize control of the city from the Sudanese military and allied armed groups.
The Sudan Doctors Network, a body representing medical professionals in the country, says that dozens of people were killed in the strike during morning prayers. It accused the RSF of carrying out the attack but this hasnât been independently verified. One of the clips we have geolocated, through matching the buildings, trees and electricity poles to satellite imagery, shows several bodies lying on the ground surrounded by rubble. We can also see corrugated sheets and mangled metal frames which formed the roof of the mosque. The other video we have verified shows bodies wrapped in shrouds and blankets on a dirt road just next to the mosque that was struck - which is located west of the city, near the University of el-Fasher. Most of the footage is too graphic to share - but we have counted about 30 bodies - many of which are wrapped in shrouds. BBC Africa correspondent Barbara Plett Usher has been told by a senior medical source that at least 78 people were killed.The RSF has recently intensified its campaign to capture el-Fasher, the last remaining army stronghold in Darfur. On Thursday, its fighters entered a key base used by armed groups fighting alongside Sudanese forces.Image source, Facebook

New satellite imagery taken yesterday shows that several displacement camps in Gaza City for people who have had to leave their homes during the Israel-Hamas war have been dismantled during the past few days. The image above shows part of al-Shati on 15 and 18 September where a camp measuring around 600 sq m has been almost completely emptied. Similar scenes can be found at several locations around the city where we've also observed Israeli military activity. This represents the most rapid rate of evacuation since the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) began a ground operation which it has said aims to occupy and control Gaza City. Israel has said 3,000 Hamas fighters remain in what it has described as the group's "main stronghold". Residents of Gaza City have been told to leave by the Israeli army which opened a temporary evacuation route along Salah al-Din road for anyone seeking to move south. It is not clear how many people used the route before it closed this morning.Meanwhile a contrasting picture is emerging in the south of Gaza where new encampments are filling up rapidly.Below we can see two satellite images of the same place near Hamad Town, just outside Khan Younis, where new tents are appearing on a near-daily basis.

Image source, ReutersImages overnight have shown explosions in Kyiv, reported in local media to be the result of Russian drones being shot down.The picture above, from Reuters, shows an explosion in the area of the Shuliavska Metro station and the Press of Ukraine printworks to the west of the city centre.Colleagues at the BBCâs Kyiv bureau saw the attack and told us they witnessed at least two drones being shot out of the sky.The Ukrainian air force claimed Russia fired 86 drones overnight, including more than 50 Shahed attack drones, 71 of which were shot down. Fifteen strikes were recorded at six locations across Ukraine.Separately, Ukraineâs President Vololdymyr Zelensky reported two people were injured in the city of Pavlohrad in the Dnipro region.

As we've been reporting, a new parliamentary report has urged the UK to take the defence of its network of undersea cables more seriously. The vast majority of international data transmissions occur through the network - and the report noted that the UK's main back-up system relies on satellites, which can only handle about "5% of subsea cable capacity". There is no indication that Russia has directed an attack against the UKâs cable network. But Alessio Patalano - professor of war and strategy at Kings College London - said it would be ânaiveâ to think that some hostile powers havenât sought to map the network of cables around the UK. In January, a Royal Navy submarine was authorised to surface next to a Russian research vessel - the Yantar - after it was spotted loitering around subsea cables for the second time in several months. Western countries have long suspected the ship is actually a spy vessel. And last month Finnish authorities charged the crew members of a the Eagle S, a ship accused of damaging five cables running between Finland and Estonia in the Baltic Sea. Patalano told BBC Verify that cases like the Eagle S âsuggest that foreign hostile powersâ, particularly Russia, are aware of and actively seeking to map different types of cables. He added that this was in order to be âin a position to create pressure or indeed hold countries like the UK at ransomâ.Patalano also noted that any sabotage of the UK's network could have "dramatic consequences" for the UK's financial services industry or the NHS' capacity to run medical operations.

Image source, FacebookWe have verified video showing fighters from the paramilitary group Rapid Support Forces (RSF) inside the former UN peacekeeping base in el-Fasher on Thursday, as they continue their campaign to take control of the Sudanese Armyâs last stronghold in Darfur.The base has been serving as the operational headquarters for the Joint Force of Armed Struggle Movements, a coalition of armed groups who have been fighting alongside the military.They have been central to the city's defence against the RSF, who have laid siege to el-Fasher for 15 months now.In the footage, the RSF fighters - identifiable from their camouflage - are seen moving along the roads inside the base. Some of them on foot and others are using vehicles, while smoke can be seen rising in the background and gunfire is audible in some of the clips.We verified the footage by matching visible roads, trees and buildings to satellite imagery.It is not clear yet whether they managed to gain full control of the base, which is expansive. But a video posted on X on Thursday appeared to show some Joint Force fighters still inside the base. We have established that the clip was filmed in one of the small compounds inside it by matching buildings with satellite imagery, but it isnât possible to confirm when it was filmed.The Sudanese military and the Joint Force are yet to comment.

The Israel military (IDF) has closed a temporary alternative route out of Gaza City for civilians after it issued evacuation orders for the area.Spokesman Avichay Adraee issued an update on X saying Salah al-Din Street, which was opened on Wedneday, is no longer available for people to leave Gaza City. He added that al-Rashid Street, which runs along the Mediterranean coast, was now the only âpermittedâ route for people evacuating Gaza City - where Israel has intensified a ground operation in recent weeks.Salah al-Din is Gazaâs main road running north to south - it passes through a recently remilitarised zone known as the Netzarim Corridor which was established by the IDF in 2024 and divides the territory in two. The temporary evacuation route made a significant detour from Salah al-Din as it passed through Netzarim. Israel left the corridor, which divides Gaza in two, earlier this year as part of a ceasefire deal. But satellite imagery shows military vehicles had returned to the zone on Monday as Israeli forces ramp up their assault on Gazaâs largest city. In his post, Adraee also said the IDF will âcontinue to operate with unprecedented and extreme force against Hamas and other terrorist organizationsâ.

Image source, Royal Navy via PA MediaImage caption, HMS Somerset (bottom) was deployed to escort the Russian ship Yantar (top) near UK waters in January. Defence Secretary John Healey said Yantar was "used for gathering intelligence and mapping the UK's critical underwater infrastructure"The UK has been âtoo timidâ when defending the crucial array of undersea cables transmitting civilian and military data, a new parliamentary report has warned.A growing threat presented by Russia, China and some non-state actors means the cables are a âstrategic vulnerabilityâ for the UK, MPs and Peers on the Joint Committee on National Security wrote. Around 60 subsea cables connect the UK to the EU and the US. The vast majority of international data transmissions occur through this network. The report noted that the cables were laid in an era of âgeopolitical stabilityâ but that the government must take âgreater account of the worsening security environment over the next 5â10 yearsâ. In its report, the committee made a series of recommendations, including:
Major fines and criminal liability for malicious cable damage
Increased âdirect physical interdiction and prosecutionâ of suspicious vessels and crew
That the UK should obtain a cable repair ship by 2030, as the government currently lacks access to such vessels

On his way back to the US on Air Force One yesterday, President Donald Trump criticised Sadiq Khanâs record as London mayor.He told reporters on the plane that Khan is âamong the worst mayors in the worldâ and that âcrime in London is through the roofâ.Trump and the London mayor have been feuding for a decade. Khan spoke out about Trumpâs Muslim travel ban proposal during his first presidential campaign, while Trump described Khan as a ânasty personâ during his last UK visit in July. But does Trumpâs latest criticism of Khan hold any water?In the year to March 2025 police recorded crime was up 1% in the Metropolitan Police force area - which the London mayor oversees - compared to the year before. In England and Wales it is down 2%, the latest figures show., externalAlthough overall crime is up slightly in London, several violent crimes, such as homicide and violence with injury, have fallen in the last year. Current figures show that the rate of crime per 1,000 people in the capital was among the highest in England and Wales (105.5), but the rate in Greater Manchester was even higher (108.2).Compared to when Khan first entered office in 2016, crime in the Metropolitan Police force area has shot up by about a quarter. But in England and Wales it increased by a third over the same period. Police recorded data is generally not considered the best measure of longer-term crime trends, because changes to police recording practices can impact the number of crimes it reports. But to assess Khanâs record we need to look at crime by police force area, which is only possible using police recorded figures.

Image source, Ukrainian Special Operations ForcesWeâve authenticated footage released by Ukraineâs Special Operations Forces earlier this morning which it says shows an attack itâs carried out on Russian army logistics hub in the Kursk Region on Thursday.In a statement, the Ukrainian military said it had destroyed a storage base for material resources, ammunition warehouses, and stores for weapons and military equipment of Russiaâs 810th Separate Marine Brigade.In the two-minute video - which appears to have been recorded using an infra-red camera - we can see multiple explosions and smoke plumes at various locations across the site.We were able to geolocate where the strikes were carried out by matching the road layout, buildings and other features seen in the footage with satellite mapping of village of Giri in Kursk Region. We also reverse image searched some frames from the footage and established that it is new.According to Ukrainian special forces, the 810th Marine Brigade is actively engaged in offensive operations in Ukraine and accuse its troops of committing war crimes.
