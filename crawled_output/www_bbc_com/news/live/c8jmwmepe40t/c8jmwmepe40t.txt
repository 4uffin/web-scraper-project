This live page will be closing soon, so hereâs a quick look at what weâve been working on today. We started by piecing together what we know from internet profiles about the man suspected of yesterdayâs shooting at an immigration facility in Dallas, Texas. Our teams in Washington DC and London are continuing to dig into this story. We also verified a video of a heavily damaged church spire after several earthquakes in Venezuela and footage of a naval drone attack on one of Russiaâs Black Sea ports.This afternoon weâve been working to build a clearer picture of Israelâs latest military offensive into Gaza City. So far weâve:
Tracked the prescence of Israeli tanks moving into the city
Verified footage of leaflets being dropped from the sky to residents
Answered your questions about a video published by the Israeli military appearing to show gunfire from inside al-Shifa hospital
Plus, are swans being eaten from Royal Parks, as Nigel Farage suggested yesterday?BBC Verify Live with be back tomorrow morning with more, thanks for joining us.

Weâve been searching for online posts about the drones being flown in Danish airspace that caused disruption last night at Aalborg airport. Itâs the second time this week that drone activity has disrupted a Danish airport - on Tuesday flights were halted for several hours at Copenhagen following what police called a âdrone attackâ. Weâve seen one clip from Aalborg shared online that appears to show a light in the sky moving overhead, widely reported to have been a drone. We have been unable to confirm this.Verifying the location was more straightforward than identifying the object - as we could match a row of lights in the footage to daytime Google Street View imagery of a car park at Aalborg Airport:
A blue L sign (1), indicating a parking row, and a lamp post (2) in near it
Two road signs (3,4) that also appear in the footage
This meant we could confirm the exact location of where the footage was filmed.We carried out reverse image searches by taking screengrabs from the footage to make sure it wasnât old. As nothing came up in our search, we could confirm it was current. This morning, Danish authorities said there was a "hybrid attack" last night at Aalborg probably carried out by a "professional actor".

Image source, Ukrainian HURUkraineâs military intelligence service (HUR) has claimed one of its special forces units has carried out attacks in Russian-occupied Crimea, destroying two radar installations and a pair of Antonov An-26 transport aircraft.Posting earlier today on Telegram, external, HUR shared what appears to be drone footage - edited with graphics and video game-style music - showing the coastline before strikes hit the radars and parked aircraft on an airfield.The clip later shows the aircraft burning on the ground.
Itâs not clear when the footage was taken.We were able to geolocate the footage of one radar and the planes to the airfield in the town of Kacha, west of Sevastopol, by matching distinctive buildings and the layout of the aircraft parking areas.We were also able to verify the location of the second radar as being hit on the Tarkhankut Cape, south-west of the Crimean peninsula, by matching several buildings and a lighthouse seen in the video.We also checked whether the footage was new by running several frames through reverse image searches - these confirmed it had not appeared online before.

Iranâs state TV claimed in a report yesterday that the countryâs intelligence ministry had obtained a trove of secret documents relating to Israelâs nuclear capabilities in a âmajor intelligence heistâ.The report shows copies of passports said to belong to more than 100 Israeli scientists, along with details about military installations. It also contains footage allegedly filmed inside the Dimona nuclear reactor in southern Israel.BBC Verify has done an online trawl to check some of the images shown in the report. We found some of them were already available online before the report was broadcast - as well as being unrelated to Israel.One photo, which Iran claims is an âexclusiveâ image captured by intelligence agents of nuclear equipment and a workshop, was published in 2016 in a newsletter of a United States Department of Energy laboratory in New Mexico, as a reverse image search shows.In other parts of the report, Iran states that it has obtained private and family photographs of the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) chief Rafael Grossi, accusing Israel of spying on him.Yet one of the images, showing Grossi alongside Israelâs ambassador to the IAEA, has been publicly accessible on Grossiâs X profile, external since 2024. Iran and Israel are arch regional rivals and fought a 12-day war in June, during which Israel and the US claimed to have severely damaged Iranâs nuclear capabilities. Back in 2018, Israel successfully attained hundreds of pages of documents from inside Iran relating to Iranâs nuclear programme in a major intelligence operation.

Since the Israeli military declared its intention to occupy Gaza City in August, we've been keeping an eye out for evidence of how this has progressed.At the start of this month, satellite imagery allowed us to identify Israeli vehicles on the outskirts of the city, in the early stages of the advance. More recently we've seen on the ground footage of armoured vehicles and tanks much closer to the centre of Gaza City.
On Tuesday, we verified video from several sources showing tanks near the al-Shati camp to the north of the city. These videos were filmed by Palestinian journalists from a distance of around one kilometre (0.6 miles) away. Another clip has emerged this morning showing two tanks in the southern neighbourhood of Tel al-Hawa.This is less than a kilometre away from - and with a direct line of sight to - al-Rashid road, the route along the Mediterranean coast which the IDF has designated as the sole evacuation route out of the city. These sightings tally with what we understand of the Israeli advance, as air strikes and demolitions have intensified in these areas in recent weeks - likely in preparation for its ground forces to take control of them.

Weâre working today to build a clearer picture of the progress of the Israeli militaryâs offensive in Gaza City. Footage emerging from the city is very limited as many independent Palestinian journalists and freelancers have left or been killed.Thereâs one video we have been able to verify that shows leaflets falling from the sky on to a street where people are running to catch them.To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.This video can not be playedMedia caption, People in the Zeitoun area have been filmed collecting leaflets dropped by the IDFBy matching the pattern of streets and buildings to available satellite imagery we have been able to pinpoint that the video was filmed in the Zeitoun neighbourhood near the centre of Gaza City. Leaflets like these have been dropped frequently by the Israeli military throughout this conflict, detailing evacuation orders, combats zones or buildings to be targeted. While we have not been able to authenticate what is on the leaflets in this video we do know that the Israeli military has designated all of Gaza City as a combat zone.

Image source, Getty ImagesIn an interview on LBC yesterday, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage suggested âswans were being eaten in Royal Parks in this countryâ by âpeople who come from countries where that is quite acceptable to do soâ. Wild birds, including swans, are protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, external. It is an offence to intentionally kill, injure or take them except under license. A Royal Parks spokesperson said: âWeâve not had any incidents reported to us of people killing or eating swans in Londonâs eight Royal Parks.âOur wildlife officers work closely with the Swan Sanctuary to ensure the welfare of the swans across the parks.â The claim has since spread on social media, external via clips from a 15-year-old documentary showing a family allegedly cooking a swan being spoken to by an RSPCA officer.In the investigation the officer concluded that there was evidence of âbig white feathersâ in a bag in the bin, but could not confirm what bird they were from.The family were then told that it was illegal to take swans from the park but no further action was taken. Asked about the clip by BBC Verify, an RSPCA spokesperson confirmed it was from a 2010 episode of a programme called Animal Squad, which had previously broadcast in the UK under the title Emergency Animal Rescue.
Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingAnswering your questions about IDF footage of al-Shifa hospitalpublished at 14:01 BST 25 September14:01 BST 25 SeptemberThomas Copeland and Richard Irvine-BrownBBC Verify
Many of you have been in touch this morning to ask us about a video released yesterday by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), which it said showed Hamas operatives firing from inside al-Shifa hospital. It comes as the Israeli military pushes further in to Gaza City in its latest major offensive. The video is filmed from the air using an infrared night vision camera. It starts with figures entering the north-east corner of the hospital complex and then shows dark bursts of what the IDF says is gunfire, circled in red by the IDF, coming from the larger building beside it.Multiple munitions experts have confirmed to us that these dark bursts are heat signatures caused by small arms weaponry being fired. Using satellite imagery, BBC Verify has been able to confirm that the location of this footage is al-Shifa hospital. The IDF said the video is proof of Hamas âexploiting civilian infrastructure as manned terror command postsâ. We are unable to confirm when the footage was filmed. In a press release, the IDF said: âA few days ago, significant live fire was identified as being conducted out from Shifa Hospital in Gaza City.âWe asked the IDF for the specific day or time when the video was shot, but it declined to comment beyond the previous statement. Reverse image searches shows the video first appeared online yesterday.

Weâve been looking at the aftermath of a strong earthquake in northern Venezuela, which the US Geological Survey (USGS) reported reaching a magnitude of 6.3 in the early hours of the morning local time.It was the strongest of four earthquakes which hit the area near the Carribean coast in a short space of time, all centred around the town of Mene Grande in Zulia state. There have been no reported casualties or major damage. Posts on social media showed that Pueblo Nuevo experienced the tremors, 20km (12 miles) to the south of Lake Maracaibo - and around 150km (90 miles) south-west of the earthquakeâs epicentre.One clip showed the spire of a church that had cracked in two places and the top had fallen of entirely. The distinctive blue and white building was easily recognisable as the Santa Barbara Church in Maracaibo city, which we could geolocate using Google Maps.

Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingWhy we look for online profiles of suspectspublished at 11:41 BST 25 September11:41 BST 25 SeptemberShayan SardarizadehBBC Verify senior journalist
Once a suspectâs name has become public in the aftermath of mass shootings, we try to find as much information about them on the internet as possible.These could be social media profiles on platforms like YouTube, Reddit or Facebook, personal websites or blogs, accounts on online forums or gaming platforms - and any other publicly available information about their past, like criminal records.We do this because those details can help us find out more about a suspectâs potential motive. It is important to archive what we find where possible, as websites or apps they are hosted on often take down the profiles of suspects - to avoid spreading hateful messages, inspiring other attackers etc - and we lose access to a vital source of information. In the most extreme cases of politically motivated attacks, perpetrators often deliberately post writings or videos online in which they explain their views and motive.But itâs important to note that a suspectâs online footprint is only a part of the puzzle and can be inconclusive or liable to misinterpretation.Some young attackers have been steeped in internet subcultures and regularly use memes and ironic or trolling language, which cannot be easily explained or taken at face value.

BBC Verify is working to find about more about the man suspected of yesterdayâs shooting at a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Dallas, Texas, in which one detainee was killed and two others were wounded. The suspect, Joshua Jahn, 29, was named by acting ICE director Todd Lyons, according to the BBCâs US news partner CBS - confirming a name posted earlier on social media by a New York Post/Fox News columnist. Our team has been reviewing Jahnâs digital footprint including social media profiles that are linked to him or his relatives. Using SkopeNow, an open-source intelligence platform that finds and aggregates public data, we found Texas criminal records for a Joshua Jahn on a 2016 drug-related charge, as well as two other unspecified charges from 2016 and 2022, both of which were dismissed. Many of his social profiles are now deleted and most have no archived copies. A LinkedIn profile lists him as a former University of Texas mechanical engineering student. He also had an old account for a site about chess which has been inactive since 2015.Image source, ReutersWe also looked into a claim by right-wing commentator and Trump ally Laura Loomer that Jahnâs Facebook page featured antifa (anti-fascist) imagery. Her assertion centres on a cartoon image of a man with a gun which features communist memorabilia and is captioned âGlorious exposition, comradeâ.We havenât seen any evidence linking this image to antifa. The cartoon aligns with a common âcool story, broâ meme used sarcastically online. It is also not possible to verify whether the image appeared on his Facebook page as we have not found an archived version of it.Screenshots circulating online appear to show his motherâs Facebook page - which has now been deleted - featured a post criticising gun laws and Texas Republicans. So far weâve not found anything online that gives an indication of Jahnâs political views. Weâre continuing to search for information available online that can help us build a picture of who Jahn was.

Weâve verified footage showing what appears to be a second naval drone attack on one of Russiaâs Black Sea ports. The attack - at Tuapse in Russia's Krasnodar Territory - led to an explosion at a pier linked to an oil refinery. Footage posted yesterday evening shows naval drones being launched towards the port just before the blast. At present the level of damage is unclear, but we'll keep a look out for satellite imagery of the area. The incident came hours after a similar naval assault on the port of Novorossiysk, home to some vessels of Russia's Black Sea fleet. In that assault we saw what appeared to be a naval drone being blown up as it approached the docks. The Tuapse refinery is operated by state-owned Rosneft Oil Company, and has been a frequent target of Ukrainian attacks, but mostly by aerial drones. The image below shows the damage to a large tank following a drone attack on 14 March. Attacks on oil infrastructure have been a key feature of Ukraine's war effort, with President Volodymyr Zelensky saying such strikes are "the most effective sanctions" against Russia.Image source, Planet Labs PBC

Good morning.Following yesterdayâs
shooting at a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Dallas weâre trying to get a better idea
of who the suspect is by looking at what he posted online. Three immigration
detainees were shot - one was killed and two others were seriously injured.Weâre looking for internet
profiles â including social media and gaming platforms - to see what they can
tell us about the suspected gunman, who authorities say died of a
self-inflicted gunshot wound. Acting ICE director Todd Lyons said the suspect
was 29-year-old Joshua Jahn, according to the BBC's US partner CBS News.Elsewhere, weâve verified
videos showing an apparent Ukrainian attack using naval drones against the
Russian Black Sea port of Tuapse. Footage weâve seen shows people watching from
the shore as shots ring out in what appears to be an attempt to see-off the
attack.Following another night of
drones disrupting flights in Denmarkâs airspace weâre continuing to search for
footage that might shed light on what is happening there. Danish government
ministers have described the drone activity as a âhybrid attackâ, but say thereâs no evidence
of Russian involvement. You can get the latest updates on this story by heading to
