The president says Charlie Kirk was responsible for uniting Maga and Maha - which stands for "Make America Healthy Again". "Tomorrow we are going to have one of the biggest medical announcements in the history of our country," says Trump. "I think we've found the answer to autism." The president has been heavily promoting the upcoming announcement, most recently in remarks at an event at the American Cornerstone Institute. Experts have cautioned
that finding the causes of autism spectrum disorder - a complex syndrome that
has been studied for decades - will not be straightforward, and called some previous
efforts by the Trump administration misguided and unrealistic.

As we've been reporting, Kirk's memorial has brought Trump and Elon Musk together, months after the pair had a public fallout.But how did the world's most powerful president and the world's richest person end their once inseparable relationship?The feud came to focus in the spring after Musk publicly criticised the "One Big Beautiful" bill, which he described as a "disgusting abomination", posting: "Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong." He argued the bill would increase the national deficit, but Trump defended it, saying it cut taxes for many.The bill was passed by Congress and signed into law in July.Musk said that without him, Trump would not have won back the White House, and Trump threatened to cancel the federal contracts held by Musk's companies.Musk later said he regrets some of his comments about Trump, but the relationship between the two men has been on ice since those days of spring.Read more of our coverage here:
