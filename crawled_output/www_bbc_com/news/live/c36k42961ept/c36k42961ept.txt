Mr Arthur, who had known Dickie since the 1990s, described him as a "kind and generous man" who donated much of his earnings to charity.âHe was always very nervous before a test match and some of his colleagues found that quite difficult," Mr Arthur said. "He would arrive at the ground incredibly early, as everybody knows he always arrived early for everything. "But as soon as he got out into the middle, he was in complete control. "He was a friend of the players, he used his humour and his intellect to calm down any situations and he was revered around the world."You can listen to more of Mr Arthur's tribute here.

babies," it added.Talkling about his donation at the time in 2020, Dickie said: âThe reason I have given Â£100,000 is simply because I donât think it could go to a better causeâ¦ "When Iâve seen little babies that are so poorlyâ¦ Iâve had tears in my eyes and a lump in my throat. "It brings me so much pleasure to see these same babies growing up fit and well.â

Bad light would always seem to come when Dickie was umpiring."At Headingley, the whole ground flooded one time because of a problem with the drainage system. Dickie Bird was umpiring."He didn't give a lot out, especially LBWs. He was always quite safe and secure."All the players loved him. He was brilliant at defusing situations on the field."Fast bowlers like Dennis Lillee, Jeff Thomson - these big, aggressive characters - there could be some argy bargy on the field at times and yet they completely respected Dickie Bird."If he stepped in and said, 'c'mon lads, let's get on with the game', they stopped and got on with the game. He was massively respected. He was loved."He never married. Cricket was his life - his whole life. He just loved cricket."He was eccentric. If you are so devoted to anything there is probably some element of eccentricity about you and, in Dickie's case, it was cricket."He was a good player. He was always very nervous as a player - he'd be shaking, trembling and terribly anxious."He didn't have many shots as a batsman and got moved on from Yorkshire and came to Leicestershire."He just belonged out there with his white coat and white cap."
