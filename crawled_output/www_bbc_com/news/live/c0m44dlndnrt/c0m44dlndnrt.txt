as it barrelled along the coastlines of parts of south-east Asia, finally making landfall in China's Guangdong province a few hours ago. It caused particular destruction in eastern Taiwan after a barrier lake burst in Hualien county on Tuesday, killing 17 people, with a further 17 still missing and 32 injured.Travel disruptions, school suspensions and mass evacuations
were issued across Hong Kong and Chinaâs Guangdong province, causing chaos across the regions.
Typhoon Ragasa has slowly weakened over the hours since it made landfall, but conditions remain highly dangerous. It crossed the mainland coast near Yangjiang city with sustained winds of 144km/h (89 mph), BBC Weatherâs Sarah Keith-Lucas reports.According to weather authorities mapping Ragasaâs path, Vietnam and Laos are expected to feel the effects of Ragasa by Thursday.As for the regions already hit by the typhoon, it's now all about rescue and recovery - volunteers and military troops in China's southern coast have begun door-to-door visits and flights in Hong Kong are expected to resume
after midnight local time (17:00 BST), according to airport security.This is where we will end our live coverage for now. You can find the latest updates in our news article.

Image source, ReutersRagasa is a Filipino word that means a strong, rushing and rolling motion. It is commonly used to describe the movement of floodwaters or even anger.While it is a Filipino word (more preceisely, Tagalog). Super Typhoon Ragasa has a different name in the Philippines - Nando.Because of the sheer number of storms and typhoons that graze the country's coast or hit land, the Philippines gives local names to tropical storms and typhoons. There are 25 names per year for every letter in the alphabet plus 10 spare names. Most names are recycled but the destructive and deadly ones are retired and replaced.The Philippines also contributes local names to the regional naming system, in this case Ragasa.The country uses both local and international names. The local name is used only when the weather system is inside the Philippines reporting jurisdiction.

Image source, cclwss/ThreadsImage caption, A verified video circulating on social media shows a man catching a fish from the flooded waterAs the streets of Macau were flooded with seawater, some residents took it not as an inconvenience - but rather turned it into an opportunity. Dozens flocked to the streets as soon as floodwaters started to recede - despite the city's highest typhoon warning - bringing their own fishing nets, buckets and even wooden rods in an attempt to catch the many fish that had been washed ashore. Video footage sent to the BBC shows jubilant crowds running around the knee-deep waters in an attempt to score their catch. But it was a more serious story just a few hours before, with its meteorological agency saying that residents in some areas had to be evacuated on inflatable boats. The city's sole electricity company also cut the power supply for hours on safety grounds.However, as the Met Bureau downgraded its typhoon signal, the city is likely breathing a sigh of relief - and for some, that could mean enjoying some freshly caught fish.

Moments later, flood waters reached the school. âWithin 10 minutes, the water spread to the campus from the street. The 400-sqm sports ground was submerged." â¨â¨Chairs, tables, refrigerators and even cars were soon floating. âI was really shocked. It felt exactly like what we saw from the TV report of the tsunami after the 2011 Japan earthquake.â
He said officials may have underestimated Ragasa's impact - the lake, which was formed after a landslide two months ago, did not breach its bank when a weaker typhoon hit last month. â¨â¨"If I were still on the street, I wouldnât have been able to reach higher ground," he said. âThere were lots of objects floating in the water. I could have been hit or even electrocuted."
