Weâll soon be closing up our Verify Live coverage after a busy Monday, but youâll continue to see output from our teams in London and Washington DC across BBC News this evening.
Hereâs a rundown of what weâve been covering today. We started by verifying footage of a Ukrainian drone attack on two Russian amphibious planes at an air base in Russian-occupied Crimea. Throughout the day we brought you more expert analysis on the significance of the attack - and a profile of the early Soviet-era Be-12 aircraft targeted by Ukraine. Our fact-checking team have also been following Reform UK leader Nigel Farageâs pledge to scrap indefinite leave to remain, the settlement status held by more than 400,000 migrants in the UK. Watch Ben Chuâs analysis of how many people could be impacted by the change and read a fact-check of Farageâs claim that âwe donât knowâ how many people with the status are claiming benefits. Plus, weâve verified footage following reports of an Israeli military raid on a university in the occupied West Bank and mapped which European countries are set to recognise a Palestinian state.Thanks for joining us today. BBC Verify Live will be back tomorrow morning with more.

BBC Verify has been investigating the impact of Reform UKâs proposal outlined earlier to scrap indefinite leave to remain - a form of immigration status people can apply for after they have been in the UK for five years. While the government has already said it wants to change that to 10 years, Reformâs leader Nigel Farage said he would replace it with a renewable visa system.

Weâve brought you analysis today of Ukraineâs attack on two Russian Beriev Be-12 amphibious military aircraft at the Kacha air base outside Sevastopol in Russian-occupied Crimea. âThis is the first defeat of a Be-12 in history,â, external the Main Directorate of Intelligence (HUR) said in its post on Telegram. Weâve asked four military experts to assess the significance of these strikes.âRussia doesn't have many Be-12s,â says Alexander Lord from the Sibylline security consultancy, âand while they are old aircraft, their anti-submarine capabilities are likely useful in identifying Ukrainian drone threats.âOther experts are less sure how important the Be-12 planes are for Russia.âIn and of itself the loss of two obsolete aircraft is not especially significant,â says Justin Bronk from the Royal United Services Institute, who pointed out that there was no guarantee that these aircraft were even operational. âThe practical impact of the strike on Russiaâs military capabilities will be very limited,â agrees Mike Plunkett, a naval expert from the defence intelligence company, Janes. Where all four experts do agree, however, is that the strikes has shown the extent of Ukraine's capability to target Russia's Black Sea Fleet across Crimea. âThis is all part of Ukraine's to-date highly successful anti-access/area denial (A2AD) strategy, which has contained the fleetâs ability to conduct operations in a sea which Moscow had previously considered to be a 'Russian lake',â says Lord.âThe most significant impact of this is informational-psychological, targeting domestic, international, and Russian audiences,â highlights Dr Marina Miron of Kings College London. âBoth Ukraine and Russia are competing not only on the battlefield but also in the information space,â she says.

Image source, PA MediaReform UK has claimed it expects 800,000 people to be granted indefinite leave to remain (ILR) between 2026 and 2030. This, the party says, will cost taxpayers Â£234bn.
Reformâs policy document released earlier about its plans for ILR does not cite a source for the Â£234bn figure. When asked by BBC Verify, Reform told us the figure comes from its own internal analysis and from a report published by the Centre for Policy Studies (CPS). However, the centre-right think tank has since withdrawn the number saying its âoverall cost estimates should no longer be usedâ, external, citing changes to the data it was calculated from.
Under its previous modelling, the CPS estimated 800,000 migrants who arrived in the UK between between January 2021 and June 2024 would eventually end up claiming ILR once they start becoming eligible in five yearsâ time. The eventual net fiscal cost of this - spread over the next several decades - is Â£234bn, according to the report.The CPS told BBC Verify its withdrawal of the figure was down to the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) - which monitors public spending - changing the way it defined a âtypical migrantâ. This meant its cost estimates were no longer valid. In a statement, external, the CPS says it âhas been in communication with the OBR and other experts for clarity and will be publishing an updated estimate in due courseâ. When asked about this during the news conference, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage dismissed concerns saying the Â£234bn figure was âwithout doubtâ too low and he suspects more than 800,000 people will end up applying for ILR.

Weâve been reporting today on Ukrainian claims to have attacked two amphibious Russian planes - video of which we have geolocated to an air base near Sevastopol in Russian-occupied Crimea.The Be-12 Chayka is a Soviet anti-submarine aircraft designed in the 1950s. Built by the manufacturer Beriev to be capable of flying from both land and water, the Be-12 was the successor to the Be-6 flying boat and shares many of its predecessorâs amphibious features. To demonstrate its age, the photograph used in the graphic below shows a Be-12 on display at a Russian museum. âEfforts to replace the aging Be-12s with more modern Be-200 anti-submarine aircraft have stalled in recent years,â Alexander Lord from the Sibylline security consultancy told me. âWhile old and designed for a different age of naval warfare, the Be-12s have likely played a role in conducting maritime patrols and protecting Russia's Black Sea Fleet from Ukraine's uncrewed surface vehicles or maritime drones,â said Lord.According to the UK Ministry of Defence, external, the aircraft remains a âkey Russia assetâ in those air patrols that are âflying out of bases in occupied Crimea.ââIt is possible that this was just a target of opportunity, or it may be that Ukraine is seeking to degrade Russiaâs maritime surveillance capabilities in advance of a specific operation,â added Mike Plunkett, a naval expert from the defence intelligence company, Janes.

France, a permanent member of the UN Security Council, is expected to announce its recognition of a Palestinian state later today.
Also expected to recognise Palestinian statehood are Belgium, Malta and Luxembourg, as well as the European microstates of San Marino and Andorra.These anticipated announcements come on the heels of yesterdayâs recognitions by the UK, Australia, Canada and Portugal - which means more than three-quarters of the 193 current UN member states have recognised Palestinian statehood. After France, the US would be the only permanent UN Security Council member not recognising a Palestinian state, now that the UK has joined Russia and China. Palestine has no internationally agreed boundaries, capital city or military - making recognition significant but largely symbolic, according to analysis by our diplomatic correspondent Paul Adams. By co-ordinating these announcements, governments are expressing their support for the viability of a future Palestinian state.Follow the latest developments in our separate live coverage here.

Reform UK leader Nigel Farage earlier claimed âwe donât knowâ how many people with indefinite leave to remain (ILR) are claiming benefits âbecause the figures arenât availableâ.While there might not be a breakdown of all the different benefits claimed by people with ILR in the UK, we do know how many of them claim Universal Credit - a type of financial support to help with living costs in the UK. About a third of people claiming Universal Credit were in work as of June this year. In July, there were 213,666 people with ILR claiming Universal Credit, according to figures dating back to 2022 published by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). , externalSeparate estimates from the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford put the total population of non-EU citizens with ILR at 430,000 at the end of 2024. DWP figures show that the number of people with ILR claiming Universal Credit has been rising every month over the past year - and has more than doubled over the past three years.

Weâve been looking into reports of an Israeli military (IDF) raid on a university in the occupied West Bank overnight.
One video we have verified shows military vehicles driving in convoy towards the Birzeit University site at its southern boundary, a few miles to the north of Ramallah.Another piece of verified footage shows a person dressed in black throwing an item across the floor of an entrance to a theatre on the university premises.In a third clip, wooden poles, posters and clothing is strewn across a pavement outside a different university building. The person filming says âwe see the occupation forces have ripped pictures of the martyrs that were in Birzeit campus and thrown them on the groundâ. According to a local report and a video filmed at the same location, this building was targeted by the IDF in November 2023.In a statement posted on Facebook this morning, Birzeit University accused the IDF of detaining and assaulting members of its security staff, external. It said several buildings were raided and property was damaged.BBC Verify has approached the IDF for comment.Image source, Instragram

Weâve been looking at Reform UKâs proposal to end indefinite leave to remain. Indefinite leave to remain - also known as "settlement" - gives migrants the right to live, work and study in the UK permanently.
To be given this immigration status migrants typically must have lived in the UK for five years on a qualifying visa, although under new government proposals this is set to double to 10 years for some people. The number of settlement grants given to migrants by the UK government has been increasing since 2018.The most recent figures show that there were 163,353 grants in the year ending June 2025, external, a rise of nearly a fifth compared with 138,074 in the same period last year. The highest number of grants were given to people on work visas. There were 59,766 of these in the year to June, making up more than a third of all grants in this period. There were more than two million people on temporary visas who had a path to settlement in the UK at the end of last year, according to estimates by the Oxford Universityâs Migration Observatory, external.It did this analysis following the governmentâs announcement about changes to settlement back in May, saying at the time that "a lack of policy details and limited data make it impossible to produce a precise estimate of how many people will be affected".

Image source, Ukrainian HURImage caption, A screengrab from the video shows one of the aircraft in the drone's sights shortly before it explodesWeâve just verified a video released by Ukraineâs military intelligence service showing what appears to be a series of drone strikes on Russian aircraft. The video, which features dramatic background music and video game-style graphics edited in, includes infrared footage of two strikes on Be-12 Chayka amphibious planes, as well as an Mi-8 helicopter being attacked.The Soviet-era amphibious aircraft, meaning they are able to take off on water as well as land, are designed to target submarines and conduct maritime patrols.âThis is the first defeat of a Be-12 in history,â, external the Main Directorate of Intelligence (HUR) said in its post on Telegram. We are not able to verify the authenticity of this claim. By matching the pattern of runways and buildings weâve managed to geolocate the footage to an airfield close to Sevastopol in Crimea, which has been illegally occupied by Russia since 2014.Reverse image searches also indicate that the footage is newly uploaded because it has not appeared on the internet before today.Our team are speaking to military experts now so that we can bring you analysis of the significance of these strikes later.
