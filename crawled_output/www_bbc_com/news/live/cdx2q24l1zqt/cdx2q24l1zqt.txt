Image source, AFP via Getty ImagesWashington, Utah is known as one of the gateway cities for adventurers visiting Zion National Park, and the surrounding recreation areas in Utah and Arizona.But this week, it is also in the spotlight as the hometown of the man accused of killing conservative activist Charlie Kirk.Yesterday, authorities named Tyler Robinson as their suspect and announced they had taken him into custody.The media quickly descended on the address listed in Robinsonâs voter registration, a light grey two-storey home on an unassuming suburban block in Washington. According to public records, the home is also linked to Robinsonâs father.CBS News reports that Tyler Robinson was enrolled at a technical college in nearby St George, and public records indicate his family lives in the area as well.We're ending our live coverage for now, but you can read the latest on this story in our news article.

Image source, Getty ImagesOver the past three days, a shooting, manhunt and ultimately an arrest played out in front of our eyes. A shot rang out on campus at Utah Valley University at 12:23 local time (19:23 BST) on Wednesday, killing 31-year-old right-wing activist Charlie Kirk. A manhunt for the killer ensued and 33 hours later, Utah governor Spencer Cox announced "we got him" as 22-year-old Tyler Robinson was arrested and identified as the main suspect.Kirk was a polarising figure, and as America tries to return to normalcy, it's starting to grapple with what his death means moving forward. Utah Valley University will resume classes from 17 September. And Kirk's widow, Erika, has vowed that "the movement my husband built will not die". Yet as Kirk's supporters continue to pay tribute to him, senior US government figures are threatening action against anyone praising the death of the controversial right-wing activist - a testament to the climate of political division and polarisation in which his killing took place. We're expecting to see formal charges filed against Tyler Robinson on Tuesday. We also await details of Charlie Kirk's funeral, which President Trump confirmed he would attend, adding that it could be "next week". In our next post, we'll bring you the mood on the ground in Robinson's hometown of Washington, Utah.For more on this story:

Image source, ReutersSocial media posts created by X's AI chatbot Grok repeatedly misidentified the suspected killer of Charlie Kirk, the BBC's US partner CBS News reports. The broadcaster identified 10 posts which misidentified the suspect before Tyler Robinson's identity was released on Friday.
Posts featuring the wrong person's face and name were circulating across X, CBS says. Grok generated a response admitting it had "incorrectly identified" the suspected shooter. "This stemmed from processing unverified viral claims too quickly," the post adds.

Image source, Getty ImagesThrough his use of social media, Kirk was able to reach a demographic that Republic politicians typically struggle to capture, says our disinformation correspondent, Marianna Spring. He drew a lot of attention, as someone willing to go beyond the echo chamber and debate people who disagreed with him.Despite not being an elected politician, he has been credited as being instrumental in
Donald Trump's second presidential win by people involved in the campaign, like Donald Trump Jr.As he did in life, Kirk's death has ignited a whole debate, says CaitrÃ­ona Perry, a chief presenter of BBC World News AmericaThe Republicans and Democrats have been pointing fingers at one another, each blaming the otherâs rhetoric for the fatal shooting of Kirk, Perry says. More details have emerged since the arrest of suspect Tyler Robinson, but we still haven't had confirmation on the motive for the shooting.

We heard from authorities yesterday that they had discovered bullet casings with inscriptions on them, alongside a rifle wrapped in a dark towel.But these details have not made the suspect's motivation any clearer.From the inscriptions and family pictures that have emerged, suspect Tyler Robinson appears to be steeped in online culture.Several of the messages on the casings refer to memes and games. One unfired bullet casing had the words âHey fascist! Catch!â and an up, right and three down arrows - quite possibly a reference to a video game, although authorities have not yet released images of the casings.Another casing had the lyrics of the song âBella Ciaoâ inscribed on it. The song honours WWII-era partisans of the Italian resistance who fought Nazi Germany, and many different versions have used by anti-fascist and anti-authoritarian movements in the years since.But it's far from clear whether the inscriptions were indications of his politics, red herrings, or something else entirely. That has not stopped feverish speculation and finger-pointing online. Even before yesterday's revelations, powerful people in Donald Trump's orbit were blaming left-wing ideology. But Kirk also had enemies on the extreme right in the form of neo-Nazi "groypers" who consistently tried to disrupt his events. Initial reports that the killer left transgender references now appear to be untrue.And in recent years the US has been hit by several outbursts of violence that seem disconnected from any clear ideology - with killers leaving behind jumbled texts plucked from the internet and messages of nihilistic rage. At this stage, we simply don't know.

Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, An attendee wears a gun on their hip at a vigil for Charlie Kirk in Seattle, WashingtonGun laws in the US vary from state to state, explains BBC Newsbeatâs politics reporter, Jordan Kenny. Utah has âopen carryâ laws, meaning people can carry firearms in public. Itâs a hot topic that will certainly be pushed to the forefront of conversation after Kirkâs death, he says. Kirk himself was a supporter of the right to bear arms. In 2023, he said: "It's worth it to have, a cost of, unfortunately, some gun deaths every single year so that we can have the second amendment to protect our other God-given rights."Gun control reform has been a long-running, and controversial, debate in the US and legislation is very difficult to pass. In June 2022, Congress passed a bill that imposed tougher checks on young buyers of guns and encouraged states to remove guns from people deemed a threat. The bill enjoyed rare bipartisan support, and was the first significant piece of firearms legislation passed in nearly 30 years.Will Kirk's death impact gun control? "Itâs hard to say, but itâs unlikely this will lead to much change in the law", Jordan says.

Lowry Snow and Senator Daniel McCay, bringing forward a bill in 2022.However, the bill failed to pass by a single vote.The latest execution was of convicted murderer and rapist Taberon Honie, external in August 2024, the first to take place in the state in 14 years.

Image source, Getty ImagesYesterday, President Donald Trump called for Charlie Kirk's suspected killer Tyler Robinson to be handed the death penalty.Trump has long been a proponent of capital punishment and lifted a moratorium on federal executions through an executive order on the first day of his second administration in January.The majority of executions in the US are carried out on the state level, with 27 states, the military and the federal government still having capital punishment as a legally available option.While no federal executions have been carried out since Trump returned to office, he oversaw a flurry of 13 executions in the waning months of his first term in late 2020 and January 2021.Those executions made Trump the country's most prolific executioner in over a century, and broke with an 130-year-old precedent of pausing executions amid a presidential transition.The last execution came just five days before he left office in January 2021.

And, some are taking action - a Secret Service agent has been put on leave after expressing unfavourable views about the right-wing activist.The Trump administration has also taken a hard stance against negative comments about Kirk after his killing on Wednesday.American citizens aren't the only ones potentially facing consequences for their comments, with US Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau threating action against anyone praising Kirk's death."I want to underscore that foreigners who glorify violence and hatred are not welcome visitors to our country," Landau wrote on X Thursday."I have been disgusted to see some on social media praising, rationalizing, or making light of the event, and have directed our consular officials to undertake appropriate action."Since Trump's return to the White House earlier this year, the State Department has adopted more stringent checks on the social media accounts of visa applicants. Foreigners applying for study, vocational and non-academic work as well as exchange visitor visas "will be instructed to adjust the privacy settings on all of their social media profiles to 'public'," it announced in June.

Office Depot has addressed the incident on X, saying "we are deeply concerned" and that the behaviour displayed is "completely unacceptable and insensitive"."We also launched an immediate internal review and, as a result, the associate involved is no longer with the organization," it added.The incident comes hours after the US Secret Service confirmed an agent who had expressed negative views about Charlie Kirk had been put on leave.In a memo shared with the BBC's US partner CBS, US Secret Service Director Sean Curran said staff should not exacerbate the threat of politically-motivated attacks."Let me be clear, politically motivated attacks in our nation are increasing â seemingly every day," he wrote. "The men and women of the Secret Service must be focused on being the solution, not adding to the problem." Following Kirk's death, US military leaders have warned troops and staff over posts mocking the shooting the right-wing activist.

King has since apologised after multiple social media users shared footage of Kirk speaking in support of LGBTQ rights. "The horrible, evil, twisted liar apologizes. This is what I get for reading something on Twitter w/o fact-checking. Won't happen again," King wrote.For contextKirk adopted a traditional Christian conservative stance on several issues, vocally denouncing what he described as the "LGBTQ agenda" and openly opposing same-sex marriage.In a 2024 episode of The Charlie Kirk Show, the activist cited a Biblical verse saying that it stated "that thou shall lay with another man, shall be stoned to death" - with Kirk describing it as "Godâs perfect law when it comes to sexual matters".The verse actually reads: "If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall surely be put to death."

but he thinks the loss will only strengthen the movement Kirk inspired him to
join."When you try to silence a voice like

the BBC. "There are now going to be a million Charlie Kirks, and I feel
like that's the thing that we need to do.""We're going to lead the way," he says. "We owe it to Charlie."Students with various political ideologies
- including those vehemently opposed to Kirk's beliefs - told the BBC they've
