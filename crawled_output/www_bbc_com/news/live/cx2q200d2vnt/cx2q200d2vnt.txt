Talks between the two leaders turned to trade, defence and international conflict - here are five key takeaways.And away from the pomp, protests against Trump's visit took place in central London and outside Windsor Castle.We're ending our live coverage now, but you can keep up to date in our news story - as well as lots more across the BBC:

Image source, EPA/ShutterstockFor two days President Trump has been feted and honoured like no other visitor to these shores in recent years.Whether at Windsor Castle or Chequers, every effort made by king and government to charm the American leader.
It seemed to work. The visit ended with only the gentlest of disagreement over differing approaches to Ukraine and Gaza and in the end the sensitive subjects of free speech and Jeffrey Epstein produced no new headlines.
For Prime Minister Keir Starmer the highlight of the visit were promises of US investment. For President Trump no doubt the highlight was being treated like royalty by the real thing.

Trump's visit to the UK has been closely followed, and analysed. Let's round up our correspondents' takes on a trip full of ceremony and diplomacy.The visit is a reminder of how the royals can put on a show like few others, Royal correspondent Sean Coughlan says.
He adds that the UK government will hope that all the flattery and spectacle will have made Trump more receptive to tougher messages.Speaking of tougher messages, Chief political correspondent Henry Zeffman says some of the thorniest issues did not really crop up during talks between the PM and Trump - but number 10 can chalk this up as a success.And, Chief North America correspondent Gary O'Donoghue says Downing Street couldn't have hoped for the press conference to go better.North America editor Sarah Smith says Starmer does not appear to have won the ability to change the presidentâs mind.Political editor Chris Mason sums up the success of the trip, saying Starmer has managed to cement a working relationship with Trump but questions remain over whether the White House will budge.To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.This video can not be playedMedia caption, 'Was it worth it?' - BBC correspondents assess Trump's state visit

The free flowing joint news conference gave us the chance to explore in public what the president and PM are thinking on a wide range of issues. The opportunity to chat, behind the scenes, with Donald Trumpâs most senior staff can be even more revealing.The two leaders were delighted to announce the tech partnership worth Â£250 billion. But just before the news conference began, US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick told me it could have been ten times that amount if the UK would get rid of the digital services tax and change many of the regulations that, he thinks, stifle investment in Britain.Donald Trumpâs Chief of Staff Susie Wiles said that the highlight of the trip for the president was undoubtedly the state banquet at Windsor castle. But when I asked her how much difference this visit would make to Britainâs ability to influence US policy in the Middle East or in Ukraine â she said none at all. Saying that President Trump will always do whatâs right for America regardless of what his friends think.Starmer appears to have earned the right to respectfully disagree with Donald Trump without paying a diplomatic penalty. But he does not appear to have won the ability to change the presidentâs mind.

Image source, ReutersBy Richard Irvine-Brown and Katerina KarelliA lot has been made on social media of President Trump touching King Charles on the back, and Prince William on the arm, during his visit, and for walking ahead of the King.But, as former BBC royal correspondent Jennie Bond tells us, royal protocol isn't "something that's written down like the constitution - it's flexible".Some posts we've seen criticising the president have had 5m views.But walking ahead is fine if the monarch invites a guest to do so - and King Charles did guide President Trump ahead of him, as he has done previously for other world leaders.With physical contact, according to the official Royal Family website , externalthere are âno obligatory codesâ but some people may use âtraditional formsâ of greeting senior royals. That could be a handshake or a curtsy. As the BBCâs royal correspondent Daniela Relph explains: âPalace officials knew Trump was a president who did his own thing, wanted to feel special, and if things were unusual, nobody was going to worry."

Image source, EPAFor more than a century, a country house in the Chiltern hills of Buckinghamshire has been a retreat for the prime minister of the day. Churchill, Thatcher, Gorbachev, Clinton â historyâs cast list among those to host here and land here at Chequers. But perhaps no visitor here has ever been as gustily unpredictable as todayâs. I have witnessed first hand â at least in public â the relationship between these two men from their first meeting a year ago in New York to now. Keir Starmer has managed to cement a working relationship of mutual warmth and respect â and in so doing managed to tame the presidentâs more erratic tendencies when they appear together in front of the cameras. Their instincts, communication styles and politics are wildly different, but Donald Trumpâs disagreements with Starmer today were somehow channelled past him, rather than at him. This state visit has provided the UK with invaluable face time with the president â and so the opportunity to both set out the UKâs position and attempt to persuade.The prime minister has been successful in the former, but itâs more of an open question on the latter â with little evidence of the White Houseâs positions budging.

By Tom Edgington and Kevin NguyenTowards the end of the press conference, Trump was asked about Lord Mandelson - who was sacked as UK ambassador to the US following revelations about his friendship with the convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.Trump said âI donât know him actuallyâ, before inviting Keir Starmer to comment.But there are photos of Trump and Mandelson together, including in the Oval Office on 8 May this year at the announcement of the US-UK trade agreement.Lord Mandelson recalled this meeting with Trump in an interview with Newsnight, saying: âWhen I first walked into the Oval room, he [Trump] said âGod, youâre a good-looking fellow, arenât youâ. Image source, ReutersOn 9 September - two days before Lord Mandelson was fired - both were together in the White House alongside Scottish National Party leader John Swinney who published the photos of their meeting., externalAccording to the Times, external, the pair âmet several timesâ during Mandelsonâs tenure as ambassador.
Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingTrump pivots Epstein questionpublished at 17:14 BST 18 September17:14 BST 18 SeptemberBernd Debusmann JrReporting from Washington DC
For months now, Donald Trump and his administration have been doing everything they can to avoid further questions regarding Jeffrey Epstein - with the president often swift to dismiss it as a "dead issue" and snapping back at reporters who dare ask about it. The fact that the UK's ambassador to Washington, Lord Peter Mandelson, was felled by that very issue created a situation of potential awkwardness when Trump arrived in the UK.A worst case scenario for both men would have been to have a public disagreement on the issue, particularly if Trump had disagreed with the decision to remove Mandelson from his post. Trump rather skilfully avoided this by claiming he does not know Mandelson, and passing the question onto Starmer. His claim to not know Mandelson, however, rings hollow. The former ambassador met with him in the Oval Office as recently as 9 September - just two days before his dismissal. And during Starmer's visit to the White House in May, Trump and Mandelson stood close together, with Trump praising his "beautiful accent". In our next post, we'll bring you the latest from BBC Verify, who have looked into whether Trump knew Lord Mandelson.

If I was Downing Street, Iâd be cracking open a champagne right now.You couldnât have hoped for that to go any better. Donald Trump was in one of those kinds of reflective moods. Itâs obviously been a long visit and that has taken a toll to some degree.
There were opportunities for fireworks there. People laid some bait in terms of freedom of speech a couple of times. That wasnât taken in terms of attacking the UK. When it came to the recognition of Palestine, all that was said by Trump what âwe disagree â itâs one of the few things we disagree on.â And then, he stopped.
