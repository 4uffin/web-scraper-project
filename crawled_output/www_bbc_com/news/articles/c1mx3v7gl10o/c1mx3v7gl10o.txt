Success gets them a spot on the wall of champions, but more importantly helps them survive the winter.Guy Runco and the Katmai ConservancyA very fat bear carries her weight well near Brooks RiverMama bear beats rival who killed her cub to win Fat Bear WeekLast year's winner, Grazer, took the title for the second time, besting Chunk by thousands of votes. Both are back again in 2025, and are early favourites among the 12 brown bears in this year's contest.Chunk suffered a broken jaw earlier this year, potentially hampering her success, while Grazer is a defensive mama bear raising her third litter of cubs."Chunk's resilience, Grazer's skill, and Bucky's intelligence are only a few of the amazing stories we followed at Brooks River this summer," said Charlie Annenberg, founder of explore.org, which produces the contest in partnership with the National Park Service and the Katmai Conservancy. "The bears have grown as fat as I've ever seen them thanks to another exceptional salmon run. Go big or go home!"Guy Runco and the Katmai ConservancyA bear watches a river full of salmon downstream of Brooks FallsKatmai is home to some of the world's largest brown bears. Adult males average up to 408kg ( 900lb) in mid-summer and often pack on the equivalent of 25% of their bodyweight by autumn. The largest males often tip the scales at more than 540kg.The contest is the brainchild of former ranger Mike Fitz. What started as a one-day competition with about 1,700 votes in 2014 has since gone global, drawing and educating fans across the world.As many as 10 million people have tuned in to the Katmai livestreams in recent years to watch the bears vie for fish. Last year, about 1.2 million votes were cast from more than 100 countries.BearsAlaskaUnited StatesRelatedFat Bear Week kicks off - watch some of the contestantsWatch: Bear caught on CCTV searching for food in Indian templeMan copies 'peeing bear' for friend with cancerMore from the BBC1 hr agoComey indictment escalates Trump's promise of political retributionThe criminal case against Comey fulfils the president's desire to seek retribution and further raises concerns about abuse of power.1 hr ago2 hrs agoWatch: 'I'm not afraid', says James Comey after indictmentThe former FBI director said he had "great confidence in the federal judicial system" after being indicted on two charges.2 hrs ago2 hrs agoFormer FBI director James Comey indicted on two chargesJames Comey says he is innocent after being accused of lying to Congress in 2020 while testifying about leaks to the media.2 hrs ago6 hrs agoUS President Gerald Ford's would-be assassin dies at age 95Sara Jane Moore fired two shots at the Republican president during his visit to San Francisco in 1975.
