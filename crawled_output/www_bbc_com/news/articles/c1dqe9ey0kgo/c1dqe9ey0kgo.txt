But despite his success, Redford was never comfortable with his tag as a good-looking heartthrob."People have been so busy relating to how I look, it's a miracle I didn't become a self-conscious blob of protoplasm. It's not easy being Robert Redford," he once told New York magazine.He teamed up again with Newman for crime caper The Sting in 1973, also considered a classic.But despite their long-running friendship and on-screen chemistry, the pair never appeared on screen together again.Getty ImagesButch Cassidy and the Sundance kid's writer, William Goldman, initially dismissed Redford as "just another California blonde"Redford's biggest contribution to film was arguably Sundance Film Festival, which helped boost independent film-making in the late 80s and early 90s, to rival the period which launched his career.Films that premiered at Sundance and went onto huge success include Four Weddings and a Funeral, Precious, Manchester by the Sea, Little Miss Sunshine, The Blair Witch Project and Get Out.In 2014, Redford spoke to the BBC about the festival, saying at the time: "I didn't want to do it in New York or LA... I said, let's put it in Utah, let's make it hard to get to. Let's make it weird."We started Sundance as a place to come and develop new artists, with the ambition of creating a community and giving them a platform for their work. I don't think our mission has changed at all," he explained."Thirty years ago, these people had nowhere to go. Now I'm very proud that actually, the directors of Gravity and American Hustle - Alfonso Cuaron and David O Russell -
actually came up through Sundance, and now they work in the mainstream."Many of the films that make it to the Oscars were helped by Sundance along the way."Our film, Coda, came to the attention of everyone because of Sundance," wrote actress Marlee Matlin, who starred in the film."Sundance happened because of Robert Redford.
