He will be missed greatly. The family requests privacy."Tributes have been paid to the Oscar-winning star by actors including Meryl Streep and Jane Fonda.Redford, also famous for founding Utah's Sundance Film Festival, won a best director Oscar in 1980 for Ordinary People. He announced his retirement from performing in 2018, having said in 2016 that he was "tired of acting".Getty ImagesButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid turned its stars Redford and Paul Newman into global starsHollywood actress Streep, who co-starred with him in Out of Africa, led the tributes, saying: "One of the lions has passed. Rest in peace my lovely friend."Jane Fonda, a lifelong friend of Redford who starred alongside him in films such as 1967's romcom Barefoot in the Park, said he "was a beautiful person in every way.""It hit me hard this morning when I read that Bob was gone. I can't stop crying. He meant a lot to me and was a beautiful person in every way. He stood for an America we have to keep fighting for," she added.Director Ron Howard, writing on X, described Redford as "a tremendously influential cultural figure" and an "artistic gamechanger", while actor Colman Domingo posted: "With love and admiration. Thank you Mr Redford for your everlasting impact. Will be felt for generations. RIP."Speaking to the BBC, actor Leonardo DiCaprio described Redford as "an absolute legend" and said that his death is a "horrible loss"."Not only was he a great actor and did incredible political films, he was an incredible environmentalist too.

Thank you Robert Redford."Obituary: Enthralling star with an aura that lit up HollywoodUS President Donald Trump told journalists as he left the White House on Tuesday that "Robert Redford had a series of years where there was nobody better. There was a period of time when he was the hottest. I thought he was great."Former secretary of state and presidential candidate Hillary Clinton described Redford as a "true American icon".Posting on Instagram, she said: "I always admired Robert Redford, not only for his legendary career as an actor and director but for what came next."He championed progressive values like protecting the environment and access to the arts while creating opportunities for new generations of activists and filmmakers."Getty ImagesButch Cassidy and the Sundance kid's writer, William Goldman, initially dismissed Redford as "just another California blonde"It was 1969's Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, a Western film about two bank robbers, co-starring Paul Newman, that made Redford an overnight star. But despite his success, Redford was never comfortable with his tag as a good-looking heartthrob."People have been so busy relating to how I look, it's a miracle I didn't become a self-conscious blob of protoplasm. It's not easy being Robert Redford," he once told New York magazine.He teamed up again with Newman for crime caper The Sting in 1973, also considered a classic.But despite their long-running friendship and on-screen chemistry, the pair never appeared on screen together again.Redford's biggest contribution to film was arguably Sundance Film Festival, which helped boost independent film-making in the late 80s and early 90s, to rival the period which launched his career.Films that premiered at Sundance and went onto huge success include Four Weddings and a Funeral, Precious, Manchester by the Sea, Little Miss Sunshine, The Blair Witch Project and Get Out.In 2014, Redford spoke to the BBC about the festival, saying at the time: "I didn't want to do it in New York or LA... I said, let's put it in Utah, let's make it hard to get to. Let's make it weird."We started Sundance as a place to come and develop new artists, with the ambition of creating a community and giving them a platform for their work. I don't think our mission has changed at all," he explained."Thirty years ago, these people had nowhere to go. Now I'm very proud that actually, the directors of Gravity and American Hustle - Alfonso Cuaron and David O Russell -
actually came up through Sundance, and now they work in the mainstream."Many of the films that make it to the Oscars were helped by Sundance along the way."Our film, Coda, came to the attention of everyone because of Sundance," wrote actress Marlee Matlin, who starred in the film."Sundance happened because of Robert Redford. A genius has passed. RIP Robert."Coda went on to win best picture at the Academy Awards in 2022.On-screen chemistryRedford's other roles included The Candidate, All the President's Men, Indecent Proposal and The Way We Were.He also turned his hand to directing, including A River Runs Through It, starring Brad Pitt, in 1992, Quiz Show (1994) and The Horse Whisperer (1998), in which he starred opposite Scarlett Johansson and Kristin Scott Thomas.Redford was also a keen environmental campaigner.He leaves behind his wife Sibylle Szaggars who he married in 2009, according to CBS News. He had previously been married to Lola Van Wagenen - the couple had four children before divorcing in 1995.One of their children, Scott, died at the age of two months from sudden infant death syndrome, CBS reports, and James, died of cancer in 2020.He is survived by two daughters - Shauna, an artist, and Amy, a director.Hollywood icon Robert Redford dies age 89Robert Redford: The enthralling star whose 'aura' lit up HollywoodRobert Redford 'tired of acting'Robert Redford's 10 greatest film rolesFilmRelatedHamnet to Sinners: 12 films to look out for as Oscars race beginsI was the poster boy for Tourette's and swore in front of the QueenI'm nothing like my Peaky Blinders character, says Cillian MurphyBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
