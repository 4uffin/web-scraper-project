The second quarter growth - the fastest pace in nearly two years - followed a contraction earlier this year.Economists said the US economy was doing reasonably well but some uncertainties remain.Consumer spending rose by 2.5% in the year to the end of June, up from a previous estimate of 1.6%.In the first three months of 2025, the US economy shrank at a rate of 0.6% as companies rushed in imports to get ahead of US President Donald Trump's tariffs, which chipped away at GDP.American consumers, the engine of the world's largest economy, have remained resilient in the face of tariffs and economic uncertainty. Retail sales rose 0.6% in August from the prior month, beating expectations, according to data from the Commerce Department released last week.The continued strength in spending, which has defied worries about a slowdown, is in contrast to recent data showing a weakening labour market. Employers added just 22,000 jobs in August, fewer than expected, while the unemployment rate ticked up from 4.2% to 4.3%, according to the Labor Department.But initial claims for unemployment insurance fell last week to their lowest level since July, the Labor Market said on Thursday, in a sign that the jobs market might not be in as dire shape as other data have suggested."The latest economic data are considerably more upbeat than the droopy August jobs report," said Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank. "The latest GDP and jobless claims data should ease the bout of anxiety kicked off by the weak August jobs report."Economic momentum remained steady in the first half of the year despite mounting policy headwinds, said Lydia Boussour, senior economist at EY-Parthenon. But she cautioned that "with the impact of tariffs and policy uncertainty becoming increasingly visible, slower US growth and higher inflation are still on the horizon."Poorer Americans hit hardest as tariffs fuel price risesNew home sales in US jump to fastest pace in three yearsUS economyTrump tariffsGDPRelatedStarbucks to close some US and UK stores'There's no way we can afford $100,000': Small firms scramble over H-1B visa feesCould the US interest rate cut boost the housing market?More from the BBC38 mins agoTrump announces new tariffs on drugs, trucks and kitchen cabinetsThe US president said the move aims to help protect American manufacturers from foreign imports.38 mins ago4 hrs agoBosch to cut 13,000 jobs to save billions in costsThe engineering giant says increased competition and costs mean it must scale back.4 hrs ago7 days agoUS revokes visas of Indian executives over alleged fentanyl traffickingThe US embassy said “these individuals and close family members may be ineligible for travel” to the US.7 days ago7 days agoCanada and Mexico agree to deepen ties amid Trump trade warThe two also commit to a shared partnership with the US ahead of a review of a key North American free trade agreement.7 days ago8 days agoScotch whisky wants a pass on US tariffs.
