ICC deputy prosecutor Mame Mandiaye Niang said Duterte was an "indirect co-perpetrator" in the killings, which the court alleges were carried out by others, including police. The first count laid against Mr Duterte concerns his alleged involvement in the killings of 19 people in Davao City between 2013 and 2016 while he was mayor there. The other two charges relate to times when he was serving as president of the Philippines, between 2016 and 2022, and launched his so-called war on drugs. The second count relates to the murders of 14 "high-value targets" across the country, while the third relates to the murder and attempted murder of 45 people in village clearance operations. Prosecutors referred to how Mr Duterte and his alleged co-perpetrators "shared a common plan or agreement to 'neutralise' alleged criminals in the Philippines (including those perceived or alleged to be associated with drug use, sale or production) through violent crimes including murder". He has offered no apologies for his brutal anti-drugs crackdown, which saw more than 6,000 people killed - although activists believe the real figure could run into the tens of thousands.Mr Duterte said he cracked down on drug dealers to rid the country of street crimes.What we know about Duterte's ICC arrest warrant... in 92 secondsRodrigo Duterte is the first Asian former head of state to be indicted by the ICC - and the first suspect to be flown to The Hague in Netherlands - where the court is based - in over three years. He has been in custody there since March. His lawyer has said Mr Duterte is not able to stand trial due to poor health. In May, the former president was again elected mayor of Davao, despite being in prison. His son Sebastian (who had been serving as mayor since 2022), has continued as acting mayor in his father's stead. Mr Duterte's supporters alleged the ICC was being used as a political tool by the country's current president Ferdinand Marcos, who had publicly fallen out with the powerful Duterte family.The ICC effectively has no power to arrest people without the co-operation of the countries they are in, which is most often refused - and Marcos had previously dismissed the idea of co-operating with the ICC.Duterte's first night in ICC custody is a pivotal moment for the courtPhilippines' Duterte in The Hague after ICC arrest over drug warMarcos' hold on senate grows shaky while Duterte wins mayor race from jailRodrigo DuterteInternational Criminal CourtPhilippinesRelatedThe Philippines has voted - now the game of thrones begins againMarcos' hold on senate grows shaky while Duterte wins mayor race from jailSara Duterte: The 'alpha' VP who picked a fight with Philippines' president More from the BBC4 hrs agoMass evacuations as southern China braces for strongest storm of the yearRagasa is the strongest storm anywhere on Earth so far this year.4 hrs ago6 hrs agoThree West African countries to quit International Criminal CourtThe three military juntas, who came to power through coups, say the judicial body is 'incapable' of handling 'proven war crimes'.6 hrs ago11 hrs agoSuper typhoon hits Philippines as thousands evacuateRagasa has hit northern Philippines and is barrelling towards southern China.11 hrs ago2 days agoWatch: Philippines anti-corruption protests turn violentThousands of demonstrators took to the streets of the capital Manila, with some clashing with police.2 days ago6 days agoFury over corruption and 'nepo babies' as floods paralyse PhilippinesAn unusually fierce monsoon has derailed daily life more than ever in the South East Asian nation.6 days agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
