Several lorries were torched."Economic asphyxiation" is the militants' goal, Mamadou Bodian of Senegal's Cheikh Anta Diop University told the BBC.He and others point to a strategic shift by the militants, who no longer rely solely on military confrontation to assert territorial control.Analysts fear that, if successfully implemented, the embargo announced by JNIM on Kayes and Nioro-du-Sahel could paralyse western Mali.So far, there is no shortage of fuel in Bamako, however prices have risen by about 10% in places and there has been an increase in the number of electricity cuts.What does the army say?The Malian army initially downplayed the blockade, with spokesman Col Souleymane Dembélé dismissing reports of a siege as an "information war orchestrated by foreign media".Footage circulating on social media of besieged vehicles on the Dakar-Bamako
corridor had been taken out of context, he insisted. ''The video of the bus being set on fire dates from April and has no connection with the so-called blockade."According to the army spokesman, "no systemic interruption of transport has been observed" in western Mali and the real challenge facing people in the Kayes region is "the rainy season and not the actions of terrorist groups".XMali's military says social media videos of buses on fire are oldCol Dembélé also characterised JNIM's increased activity as "the last gasps of an enemy at bay and in retreat". It is a refrain often used by Malian officials since the junta seized power five years ago.Last week, the army said it had conducted an airstrike on a JNIM camp in Mousafa, in Kayes, killing "several dozen militants" and destroying a site allegedly used for logistics and planning.Reinforcements were sent to Kayes and Nioro-du-Sahel, it said, with the military announcing "hunting and destruction operations" along major roads and a "large-scale offensive" on the Diéma-Nioro corridor.State media reported that hostages were freed during the operations, but did not say how many.Such efforts by the army do not appear to have lessened locals' fears nor the disruption to their lives. Residents report that militant checkpoints remain in place, while transport companies have suspended operations and lorry drivers continue to face intimidation.Why is this part of Mali so important?Kayes is said to account for approximately 80% of the country's gold production, and is also deemed Mali's "gateway to Senegal". It is a logistics hub where international trade routes converge.Mali is a landlocked country heavily dependent on neighbouring ports for fuel, food and manufactured goods, so control of Kayes is essential.The blockade not only disrupts local life, but directly threatens Bamako's economic stability."The Kayes region has become a major strategic target for JNIM, which considers it a vital space," says the Dakar-based Timbuktu Institute."The jihadists intend to disrupt the country's supplies, to destabilise, or even suffocate the Malian economy,
isolate the capital Bamako and increase economic pressure on the Malian transitional regime," it says.The blockade also signals the geographic expansion of JNIM's insurgency. Traditionally, the group's operations have been concentrated in northern and central Mali - in Mopti, Segou and Timbuktu. However, JNIM has in recent years made significant inroads into southern Mali, including Sikasso and Koulikoro regions.By turning its attention to Kayes, the group is not only widening its footprint but threatening to encircle Bamako.What else is at stake?Since 2012, Mali has been in the grip of a profound security crisis fuelled by violence from groups affiliated with al-Qaeda and the Islamic State (IS) organisation, as well as other armed militia.Local and international media warn that JNIM's recent isolation of parts of southern Mali could pave the way for similar incursions into neighbouring coastal countries.The crisis underscores the limits of Mali's reliance on military force, supported by Russian Africa Corps mercenaries, as the Wagner Group is now known, whose role in operations is not officially acknowledged.By disrupting trade routes from Senegal and Mauritania, JNIM has shown it can project influence westward, raising fears of an expansion into those countries. The Union of Senegalese Truckers (URS) blamed militants and described the recent abductions of lorry drivers as a threat to regional trade.Mali is Senegal's main African trade partner, accounting for more than $1.4bn (£1bn) in exports last year. The Bamako-Kayes route carries fuel, cement, foodstuffs and manufactured goods critical to both economies.There is a risk that what began as a tactical disruption may evolve into a prolonged siege, eroding confidence in Malian state institutions and exposing its fragility.JNIM's "choice to target buses and tankers is not insignificant - it aims to strike at the heart of Mali's social and economic mobility", Bamada.net reported last week.More than a local flare-up, the siege of Kayes is a warning sign that the jihadist insurgency in Mali has entered a new phase with the repercussions of economic sabotage reaching well beyond Mali's borders.More BBC stories on Mali:Suspected French spy arrested in alleged Mali coup plotHow an al-Qaeda offshoot became one of Africa's deadliest militant groupsMali signs trade deal with Russia as ties strengthenHow 'blood gold' is fuelling conflict in West AfricaGetty Images/BBCGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.Follow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafricaBBC Africa podcastsFocus on AfricaThis Is AfricaSenegalMauritaniaMaliAfricaIvory CoastRelatedCape Verde on brink of reaching first World Cup African battle for 2026 World Cup spots intensifiesBoat heading to Canary Islands capsizes, killing at least 69 passengersMore from the BBC15 hrs ago'I'm Kenyan, don't shoot' - the athlete who says he was duped into the Russian armyEvans Kibet, now being held in Ukraine after surrendering, says he did not know he was signing up.15 hrs ago17 hrs agoBotswana declares public holiday after 'historic' athletics gold medalPresident Duma Boko congratulates the men's 4x400m relay team for winning gold at the World Athletic Championships.17 hrs ago2 days agoMurdered Kenyan's friends want UK soldier to face justiceFriends of the stabbed 21-year-old Kenyan woman recount to the BBC events on the night she went missing.2 days ago2 days agoMalawi police arrest eight for alleged election fraudOfficials are on high alert after the 2019 presidential election result was annulled due to vote tampering.2 days ago2 days agoSouth Africa police uncover $20m crystal meth labFive North Americans were arrested after the raid on a farm in the east of the country, officers say.2 days agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
