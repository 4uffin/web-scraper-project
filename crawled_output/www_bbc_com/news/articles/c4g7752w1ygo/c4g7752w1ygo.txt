Russia has denied or downplayed the violations. Defence Secretary John Healey said the RAF flights sent "a clear signal: Nato airspace will be defended".He added: "I'm proud of the outstanding British pilots and air crew who took part in this successful operation to defend our allies from reckless Russian aggression."Two fighter jets took off from RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire on Friday night to patrol Poland's skies, supported by an RAF Voyager air-to-air refuelling aircraft, before returning to the UK early on Saturday, the MoD said.Nato had announced the mission, dubbed the Eastern Sentry, on 10 September following 19 drone incursions into Polish airspace.Healey confirmed that the UK would be involved when he visited RAF Brize Norton five days later.Describing Russia's actions as "reckless, dangerous and unprecedented," he said: "When we are threatened, we respond together."PA MediaMoscow maintains that it has "no plans to target" facilities in Poland. Drones and missiles have sporadically veered into countries bordering Ukraine in the years since Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022. But the arrival of 19 drones into Poland on a single day was the most serious incident of its kind and the first time a Nato member has directly engaged Russian drones since the war began, with Poland shooting down three of them.Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said it was "the closest we have been to open conflict since World War Two".Romania was the second Nato country to report a Russian drone had breached its airspace on 14 September.Then on Friday, Estonia requested an urgent consultation with other Nato members after three Russian warplanes entered its airspace "without permission and remained there for a total of 12 minutes". Russia has denied violating Estonia's airspace.Nato's Article 4, first triggered by Poland after Russia's drone incursion, allows member countries to bring any issues of concern to the North Atlantic Council, the alliance's main political decision-making body. The RAF operation comes 85 years after the Battle of Britain, when Polish pilots fought alongside the RAF to thwart sustained German air attacks in Britain's skies during World War Two."It is especially poignant that RAF pilots and crew are once again standing shoulder to shoulder with Poland in defence of our shared security," Healey said.Air Marshal Harv Smyth, chief of the Air Staff, said the UK's "partnership with Nato has never been stronger"."We remain agile, integrated, and ready to project airpower at range."More on this storyRomania becomes second Nato country to report Russian drone in its airspaceNew Nato mission to bolster eastern flank after Russia drone incursionEstonia seeks Nato consultation after Russian jets violate airspaceRoyal Air ForceRussiaNatoPolandUkraineEuropeRelatedFather and son honour Battle of Britain in photosPlane spotters warned not to stand in roadWW2 bomber to miss flying season for maintenance More from the BBC4 hrs agoRussia's involvement in drone sightings cannot be ruled out, Danish PM saysOn Monday night Kastrup airport in Copenhagen was forced to shut down for several hours following several drone sightings. 4 hrs ago1 day ago'I'm Kenyan, don't shoot' - the athlete who says he was duped into the Russian armyEvans Kibet, now being held in Ukraine after surrendering, says he did not know he was signing up.1 day ago1 day agoBook helps explain to children why their home is crumblingThe book explains to young readers why homes and buildings in their communities are developing cracks.1 day ago2 days agoGlobal conflicts drive demand for war risk insuranceWars in Ukraine and the Middle East are fuelling take-up of cover against impact and damage.2 days ago2 days agoHow Russian-funded fake news network aims to disrupt election in Europe - BBC investigationAn undercover reporter discovers a network is offering to pay for social media posts undermining Moldova’s ruling party.
