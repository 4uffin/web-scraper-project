The National Anti-Terrorism Prosecutor's Office (PNAT) said it had been informed by Interpol of the arrest by Palestinian authorities, under a 2015 international warrant.Adra faces charges of terrorist murder and attempted terrorist murder.The prosecutor's office declined to comment on the exact circumstances and date of his arrest.France's Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said the arrest had been made possible by President Macron's decision to recognise an independent Palestinian state, enabling an extradition request.Along with France, countries including Australia, Belgium, the UK and Canada are expected to formally recognise a Palestinian state on Monday before the annual leaders' gathering at the UN General Assembly - a move strongly contested by Israel and many French Jews.Adra is suspected of leading the assault and operating as one of the gunmen who shot at diners. To date, no one has been punished for the attack, which took place on the busy Rue des Rosiers on 9 August 1982 in the predominantly Jewish Marais quarter.In July, French judges ordered the trial of six people, including Adra, for murder and assault in a special terrorism court for the historic attack.Another suspect, Abu Zayed, is in custody in France having been extradited from Norway, along with another suspect. Three other suspects are still at large, believed to be hiding in Jordan and the West Bank.A trial is expected early next year, with three of the six defendants expected to be present and the others tried in absentia. Adra is believed to have been a member of dissident Palestinian faction the Abu Nidal group, which was active in the 1970s and 80s.The group split from Yasser Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organisation and is blamed for a series of violent attacks across the world that killed at least 900 people. Macron added in his tweet: "France does not forget. It always enforces and punishes. Justice will prevail."Yohann Taïeb, a spokesman for some of the victims of the attack, said on X that it was a "significant step" and urged Macron to secure Adra's extradition "as quickly as possible".EuropeFranceEmmanuel MacronRelatedDrone attacks leave Denmark exposed - and searching for responseGreece extradites oligarch to Moldova in $1bn fraud caseWoman in Spanish cold case identified after 20 yearsMore from the BBC11 hrs agoFrom former president to future prisoner: Sarkozy's conviction divides FranceSarkozy is back where he used to be – dominating the news and dividing the nation, writes the BBC's Hugh Schofield.11 hrs ago15 hrs agoFormer French president Sarkozy given five-year sentence after Libya caseNicolas Sarkozy, president from 2007-12, was found guilty of criminal conspiracy but cleared of other charges.15 hrs ago17 hrs agoFrench navy seizes nearly 10 tonnes of cocaine off West African coastFrench authorities say the "remarkable seizure" was found on board a fishing boat following a tip-off.17 hrs ago18 hrs agoBuoy recovered after drifting away from FranceJersey Coastguard says it is speaking to French maritime officials to organise the buoy's return.18 hrs ago18 hrs agoChannel Islands and French leaders renew tiesChannel Islands' ministers and French compatriots met at the annual summit to renew historic ties.18 hrs agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseSubscription TermsAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
