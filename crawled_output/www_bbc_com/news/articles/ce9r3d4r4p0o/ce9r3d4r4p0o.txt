The National Anti-Terrorism Prosecutor's Office (PNAT) said it had been informed by Interpol of the arrest by Palestinian authorities, under a 2015 international warrant.Adra faces charges of terrorist murder and attempted terrorist murder.The prosecutor's office declined to comment on the exact circumstances and date of his arrest.France's Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said the arrest had been made possible by President Macron's decision to recognise an independent Palestinian state, enabling an extradition request.Along with France, countries including Australia, Belgium, the UK and Canada are expected to formally recognise a Palestinian state on Monday before the annual leaders' gathering at the UN General Assembly - a move strongly contested by Israel and many French Jews.Adra is suspected of leading the assault and operating as one of the gunmen who shot at diners. To date, no one has been punished for the attack, which took place on the busy Rue des Rosiers on 9 August 1982 in the predominantly Jewish Marais quarter.In July, French judges ordered the trial of six people, including Adra, for murder and assault in a special terrorism court for the historic attack.Another suspect, Abu Zayed, is in custody in France having been extradited from Norway, along with another suspect. Three other suspects are still at large, believed to be hiding in Jordan and the West Bank.A trial is expected early next year, with three of the six defendants expected to be present and the others tried in absentia. Adra is believed to have been a member of dissident Palestinian faction the Abu Nidal group, which was active in the 1970s and 80s.The group split from Yasser Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organisation and is blamed for a series of violent attacks across the world that killed at least 900 people. Macron added in his tweet: "France does not forget. It always enforces and punishes. Justice will prevail."Yohann Taïeb, a spokesman for some of the victims of the attack, said on X that it was a "significant step" and urged Macron to secure Adra's extradition "as quickly as possible".EuropeFranceEmmanuel MacronRelatedI took a job on a whim on New Year's Eve - and ended up stranded at sea for six monthsEstonia seeks Nato consultation after Russian jets violate airspaceNotre-Dame's iconic towers reopen six years after fireMore from the BBC1 day agoZidane's son switches allegiance to AlgeriaLuca Zidane, the son of France's World Cup-winning playmaker Zinedine, switches his international allegiance from France to Algeria. 1 day ago2 days agoWhy France is at risk of becoming the new sick man of EuropeThe country is at the conjuncture of several crises at once - but is it fair to blame Macron for 'this shipwreck'?2 days ago2 days agoWorkers across France strike over budget cut plansThe widespread walkouts come less than a fortnight after the government collapsed over a proposed budget.2 days ago3 days agoMacrons to offer 'scientific evidence' to US court to prove Brigitte is a woman, lawyer saysThey have filed a lawsuit against US right-wing influencer Candace Owens who claims the French first lady was born male.3 days ago4 days agoEritrean man wins block on removal to France under 'one in, one out' dealSome migrants who arrived in the UK by small boat had been told they would be put on flights to France as early as Tuesday.4 days agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
