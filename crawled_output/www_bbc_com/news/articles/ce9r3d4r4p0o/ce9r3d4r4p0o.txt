The National Anti-Terrorism Prosecutor's Office (PNAT) said it had been informed by Interpol of the arrest by Palestinian authorities, under a 2015 international warrant.Adra faces charges of terrorist murder and attempted terrorist murder.The prosecutor's office declined to comment on the exact circumstances and date of his arrest.France's Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said the arrest had been made possible by President Macron's decision to recognise an independent Palestinian state, enabling an extradition request.Along with France, countries including Australia, Belgium, the UK and Canada are expected to formally recognise a Palestinian state on Monday before the annual leaders' gathering at the UN General Assembly - a move strongly contested by Israel and many French Jews.Adra is suspected of leading the assault and operating as one of the gunmen who shot at diners. To date, no one has been punished for the attack, which took place on the busy Rue des Rosiers on 9 August 1982 in the predominantly Jewish Marais quarter.In July, French judges ordered the trial of six people, including Adra, for murder and assault in a special terrorism court for the historic attack.Another suspect, Abu Zayed, is in custody in France having been extradited from Norway, along with another suspect. Three other suspects are still at large, believed to be hiding in Jordan and the West Bank.A trial is expected early next year, with three of the six defendants expected to be present and the others tried in absentia. Adra is believed to have been a member of dissident Palestinian faction the Abu Nidal group, which was active in the 1970s and 80s.The group split from Yasser Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organisation and is blamed for a series of violent attacks across the world that killed at least 900 people. Macron added in his tweet: "France does not forget. It always enforces and punishes. Justice will prevail."Yohann Taïeb, a spokesman for some of the victims of the attack, said on X that it was a "significant step" and urged Macron to secure Adra's extradition "as quickly as possible".EuropeFranceEmmanuel MacronRelatedBook helps explain to children why their home is crumblingI took a job on a whim on New Year's Eve - and ended up stranded at sea for six monthsRAF jets join Nato air defence mission over PolandMore from the BBC6 hrs agoEuropean recognition of Palestinian state shows US still only power that countsBritain and France's decision to recognise a Palestinian state is a historic moment, but it only becomes feasible with US support. 6 hrs ago14 hrs agoTrump to address UN General Assembly after France recognises Palestinian stateDonald Trump will address UN leaders on Tuesday, as more European countries look set to join the French policy change.14 hrs ago22 hrs agoClashes break out as Italians strike demanding action over GazaTens of thousands turn out and tensions erupt around Milan's main station where 60 police are reported hurt.22 hrs ago1 day agoFrance transfixed by murder trial without a bodyCédric Jubillar has always denied killing his wife Delphine, who vanished in December 2020. 1 day ago3 days agoNotre-Dame's iconic towers reopen six years after fireNotre-Dame's Medieval towers have been restored after a massive fire ravaged the cathedral in 2019.3 days agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
