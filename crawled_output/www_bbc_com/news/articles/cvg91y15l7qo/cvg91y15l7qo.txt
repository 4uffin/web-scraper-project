The majority of cases occurred on the island of Java.However, a higher figure was reported by the Indonesian Education Monitoring Network (JPPI). This NGO recorded that as of 21 September, the number of poisoning victims had increased to 6,452 children."This abnormal situation should require the government to declare an outbreak and temporarily halt the programme for a thorough evaluation," said JPPI National Coordinator Ubaid Matraji.Some have called for changes to the scheme, including a proposal that funds be distributed directly to parents so that they can prepare meals for their children instead. The BGN has previously rejected this idea.Getty ImagesPopulist policies have earned Prabowo political pointsAcross the world, programmes offering free meals to students have proved to be effective in improving health, academic performance and attendance.But Indonesia's $28bn (£21bn) version - shaping up to be the most expensive of its kind - has become the growing target of food safety concerns and heated anti-government protests.A centrepiece of Prabowo's presidential campaign last year, the free meals programme was pitched as a way to tackle stunting - a condition caused by malnutrition that affects a fifth of children below the age of five in Indonesia."Through this initiative, our children will grow taller and emerge as champions," Prabowo said in 2023.Since he took office last October, this programme, along with other populist policies like new houses and free medical check-ups, have earned him political points. His approval ratings stood at 80% after his first 100 days in power.In the first phase, which began in January, free school meals have made their way to 550,000 students in 26 provinces.While the programme is "well-intentioned", Maria Monica Wihardja, a visiting fellow at ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, previously told the BBC there has been "no evidence" of "widespread urgency" for free school meals.According to a national survey in 2024, less than 1% of Indonesia's households went at least one day without any meals in the past year.The cost of the programme has not helped matters.Indonesia has set aside more than $10bn this year for the free school meals.By comparison, India spends $1.5bn a year to feed 120 million children in what is the world's largest such programme. Brazil's version costs about the same and serves some 40 million students.Defenders of the programme have argued that it has been approved and secured in the already-passed 2026 State Budget.But experts have warned that its colossal cost could also lead to other concerns.Large-scale social assistance programmes in Indonesia have historically been "riddled with corruption", Muhammad Rafi Bakri, a research analyst at Indonesia's audit board, told the BBC."Given the sheer size of the budget," he said, "this programme is a goldmine for corrupt officials."With additional reporting by Koh Ewe and Hanna SamosirAsiaIndonesiaRelatedAustralian film altered in China to make gay couple straightIndia imposes curfew in Ladakh after statehood protests turn violentIndia legal setback for Elon Musk's X in free speech fightMore from the BBC2 days agoThe Gen Z uprising in Asia shows social media is a double-edged swordAnti-corruption demonstrations have toppled a government - will they lead to lasting change?2 days ago6 days agoHow a man's affair with his mother-in-law became a viral film in IndonesiaNorma, a movie based on a viral true story from TikTok, has become a nationwide obsession.6 days ago11 Sep 2025Bali's worst floods in a decade kill 14Authorities say the flash floods on the popular island were caused by heavy rainfall. 11 Sep 20254 Sep 2025'The only way I can help is to send food': Indonesia protests spark support from Asian neighboursInspired by protesters, South East Asians are using apps to send food to Indonesian delivery riders.4 Sep 20253 Sep 2025Hundreds of women with brooms join protests as Indonesia leader flies to ChinaHundreds of women brandishing broomsticks marched to parliament during fierce nationwide rallies.3 Sep 2025British Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseSubscription TermsAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
