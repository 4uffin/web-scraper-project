Its geography and "porous borders" make it an ideal transit point for illicit drugs, the UN says.In Friday's raid on the farm in Volksrust, 225km (140 miles) south-east of Johannesburg, the police also seized a pellet gun loaded with blanks. The farm caretaker, who has also been arrested, was found with three live rounds.The police had been acting on a tip-off with the informant reporting "a strange chemical smell emanating from the premises [of the farm], which raised suspicions of illicit drug manufacturing"."We applaud the community members who continue to work with police and provide valuable tip-offs. Intelligence-driven operations are ongoing, and we, as police, will stop at nothing in our quest to collapse the illicit drug trade," Mpumalanga acting commissioner Maj-Gen Zeph Mkhwanazi said.Last year, a similar discovery on a remote farm in another part of the country led to the arrest of two Mexicans and two South Africans.You may also be interested in:Somalia's opioid overdose: Young, female and addictedSierra Leone declares emergency over the drug kushSeychelles: The island paradise held prisoner by heroinGetty Images/BBCGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.Follow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafricaBBC Africa podcastsFocus on AfricaThis Is AfricaSouth AfricaDrugs tradeAfricaRelatedSouth Africa recall De Kock as he ends retirementSouth African hospital worker arrested with human placentasEngland and South Africa draw T20 series after washoutMore from the BBC14 hrs agoColombian jailed for £42m cocaine smuggling plotDidier Reyes was part of a gang that was caught after landing cocaine on a beach near Easington.14 hrs ago16 hrs ago'I'm Kenyan, don't shoot' - the athlete who says he was duped into the Russian armyEvans Kibet, now being held in Ukraine after surrendering, says he did not know he was signing up.16 hrs ago17 hrs agoBotswana declares public holiday after 'historic' athletics gold medalPresident Duma Boko congratulates the men's 4x400m relay team for winning gold at the World Athletic Championships.17 hrs ago2 days agoMurdered Kenyan's friends want UK soldier to face justiceFriends of the stabbed 21-year-old Kenyan woman recount to the BBC events on the night she went missing.2 days ago2 days agoMalawi police arrest eight for alleged election fraudOfficials are on high alert after the 2019 presidential election result was annulled due to vote tampering.2 days agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
