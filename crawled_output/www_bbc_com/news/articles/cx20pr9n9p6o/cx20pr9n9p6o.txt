Its geography and "porous borders" make it an ideal transit point for illicit drugs, the UN says.In Friday's raid on the farm in Volksrust, 225km (140 miles) south-east of Johannesburg, the police also seized a pellet gun loaded with blanks. The farm caretaker, who has also been arrested, was found with three live rounds.The police had been acting on a tip-off with the informant reporting "a strange chemical smell emanating from the premises [of the farm], which raised suspicions of illicit drug manufacturing"."We applaud the community members who continue to work with police and provide valuable tip-offs. Intelligence-driven operations are ongoing, and we, as police, will stop at nothing in our quest to collapse the illicit drug trade," Mpumalanga acting commissioner Maj-Gen Zeph Mkhwanazi said.Last year, a similar discovery on a remote farm in another part of the country led to the arrest of two Mexicans and two South Africans.You may also be interested in:Somalia's opioid overdose: Young, female and addictedSierra Leone declares emergency over the drug kushSeychelles: The island paradise held prisoner by heroinGetty Images/BBCGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.Follow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafricaBBC Africa podcastsFocus on AfricaThis Is AfricaSouth AfricaDrugs tradeAfricaRelatedSouth Africa recall De Kock as he ends retirementSouth African hospital worker arrested with human placentasEngland and South Africa draw T20 series after washoutMore from the BBC2 hrs agoWhy a tiny island's fate could decide Seychelles' next presidentIndia, Qatari royals, China and ecologists have their own, very different, views on Assumption Island's future.2 hrs ago14 hrs agoFrench navy seizes nearly 10 tonnes of cocaine off West African coastFrench authorities say the "remarkable seizure" was found on board a fishing boat following a tip-off.14 hrs ago15 hrs agoFamily ran £800k drug and money laundering schemeDaniel Cotson and his parents, Paul and Stephanie, were involved in the scheme. 15 hrs ago18 hrs agoMalawi's ex-president wins election in comeback at age 85Peter Mutharika defeated the incumbent, Lazarus Chakwera, the election commission announces.18 hrs ago18 hrs agoThe professor who beat fraud allegations to become Malawi's president…againThe president-elect of the southern African nation has a long and controversial political career.18 hrs agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseSubscription TermsAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
