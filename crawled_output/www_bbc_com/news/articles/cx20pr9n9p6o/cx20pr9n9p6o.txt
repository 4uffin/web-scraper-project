Its geography and "porous borders" make it an ideal transit point for illicit drugs, the UN says.In Friday's raid on the farm in Volksrust, 225km (140 miles) south-west of Johannesburg, the police also seized a pellet gun loaded with blanks. The farm caretaker, who has also been arrested, was found with three live rounds.The police had been acting on a tip-off with the informant reporting "a strange chemical smell emanating from the premises [of the farm], which raised suspicions of illicit drug manufacturing"."We applaud the community members who continue to work with police and provide valuable tip-offs. Intelligence-driven operations are ongoing, and we, as police, will stop at nothing in our quest to collapse the illicit drug trade," Mpumalanga acting commissioner Maj-Gen Zeph Mkhwanazi said.Last year, a similar discovery on a remote farm in another part of the country led to the arrest of two Mexicans and two South Africans.You may also be interested in:Somalia's opioid overdose: Young, female and addictedSierra Leone declares emergency over the drug kushSeychelles: The island paradise held prisoner by heroinGetty Images/BBCGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.Follow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafricaBBC Africa podcastsFocus on AfricaThis Is AfricaSouth AfricaDrugs tradeAfricaRelatedSouth African hospital worker arrested with human placentasEngland and South Africa draw T20 series after washoutZulu king challenges professor to stick fightMore from the BBC51 mins agoThe British Army cannot keep ignoring the murder of our friend in KenyaFriends of the stabbed 21-year-old Kenyan woman recount to the BBC events on the night she went missing.51 mins ago10 hrs agoMalawi police arrest eight for alleged election fraudOfficials are on high alert after the 2019 presidential election result was annulled due to vote tampering.10 hrs ago24 hrs agoUS forces strike third alleged drug vessel killing three, Trump saysVenezuela has condemned a series of strikes by US forces in the Caribbean targeting alleged drug traffickers.24 hrs ago1 day ago'I'm Kenyan, don't shoot' - the athlete who says he was duped into the Russian armyEvans Kibet, now being held in Ukraine after surrendering, says he did not know he was signing up.1 day ago1 day agoDrone strike on Sudan mosque kills 78, medic tells BBCLocal activists and residents describe the early morning attack on worshippers.1 day agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
