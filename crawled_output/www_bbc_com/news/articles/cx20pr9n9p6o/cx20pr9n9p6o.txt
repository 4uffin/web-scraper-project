Its geography and "porous borders" make it an ideal transit point for illicit drugs, the UN says.In Friday's raid on the farm in Volksrust, 225km (140 miles) south-east of Johannesburg, the police also seized a pellet gun loaded with blanks. The farm caretaker, who has also been arrested, was found with three live rounds.The police had been acting on a tip-off with the informant reporting "a strange chemical smell emanating from the premises [of the farm], which raised suspicions of illicit drug manufacturing"."We applaud the community members who continue to work with police and provide valuable tip-offs. Intelligence-driven operations are ongoing, and we, as police, will stop at nothing in our quest to collapse the illicit drug trade," Mpumalanga acting commissioner Maj-Gen Zeph Mkhwanazi said.Last year, a similar discovery on a remote farm in another part of the country led to the arrest of two Mexicans and two South Africans.You may also be interested in:Somalia's opioid overdose: Young, female and addictedSierra Leone declares emergency over the drug kushSeychelles: The island paradise held prisoner by heroinGetty Images/BBCGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.Follow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafricaBBC Africa podcastsFocus on AfricaThis Is AfricaSouth AfricaDrugs tradeAfricaRelatedSouth Africa recall De Kock as he ends retirementSouth African hospital worker arrested with human placentasEngland and South Africa draw T20 series after washoutMore from the BBC58 mins agoColombia's president calls US attacks on alleged drug boats 'act of tyranny'Trump has said the airstrikes, which have reportedly killed 17, targeted drug-smuggling boats primarily from Venezuela.58 mins ago7 hrs agoMalawi's ex-president wins election in comeback at age 85Peter Mutharika defeated the incumbent, Lazarus Chakwera, the election commission announces.7 hrs ago9 hrs agoSomalia's president: They tried to kill me five timesSomalia's President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud says he is a prime target of the Islamist group al-Shabab. 9 hrs ago10 hrs agoWhy Kordofan is key in Sudan's civil warThe battle for Kordofan, with a population of eight million, is the latest frontline in Sudan's civil war.10 hrs ago12 hrs agoLandmark deal paves way for cheaper HIV protection jabThe drug - a twice-yearly injection – reduces the current HIV treatment cost in developing countries. 12 hrs agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
