called it a "wild scheme" and "highly sophisticated", as she tried to defraud the Presley family.Graceland, the rock legend's home of 20 years before his death in 1977, is a monument to his musical career and legacy, welcoming a half million visitors each year.The 120-acre property occupies a near-mythical place in American popular culture and bears the distinction of National Historic Landmark. Visitors can view Presley's collection of bedazzled costumes and classic cars, as well as exhibits and events celebrating his work. After Lisa Marie Presley, the singer's daughter and only child, died in 2023, her daughter, Riley Keough, inherited Graceland. However, in 2024, a mysterious company called Naussany Investments claimed that before her death, Ms Presley took out a $3.8m (£3m) loan using Graceland as collateral, then failed to pay.Prosecutors say that company was actually a fabrication. Findley, 54, used several aliases to pose as the bogus lender, and threatened to foreclose on Graceland and auction the compound – unless the Presley family settled the claim for $2.85m.They alleged Findley went so far as to file a fake creditor's claim in California, submit false loan documents in Tennessee, and publish a foreclosure sale notice in a local newspaper.Elvis Presley Enterprises, which runs Graceland, said at the time that no such loan existed. Ms Keough, an actress, took legal action to halt the auction.A judge later stopped the sale.According to Findley's indictment, when the case made national headlines, she falsely claimed to Ms Keough's attorneys that a Nigerian identity thief had perpetrated the scheme.Federal authorities arrested Findley in August 2024 and later charged her with mail fraud and aggravated identify theft. Pleading guilty to mail fraud in February, she told the judge she accepted responsibility for her actions.United StatesMusicRelatedUS President Gerald Ford's would-be assassin dies at age 95Amazon agrees to pay $2.5bn over claims it tricked Prime customersDallas shooter intended target to be ICE not detainees - officialsMore from the BBCJust nowHow US megastar Luke Combs helped Britain fall in love with country musicThe star looks forward to country music's famous Grand Ole Opry relocating from Nashville to London.Just now1 hr agoStray Kids downplay global fame: 'Success is a strong word'As the K-pop idols continue to break records, they stay focused on making music and meeting fans.1 hr ago7 hrs agoSean 'Diddy' Combs back in court to ask for reversal of conviction or new trialCombs' lawyers argue he was unjustly convicted under a federal law that was passed to combat human trafficking.7 hrs ago8 hrs agoBBC partly upholds complaints over Bob Vylan setThe broadcast of Bob Vylan's set at Glastonbury broke editorial guidelines in relation to harm and offence.8 hrs ago9 hrs agoFestival leaving stately home venue after a decadeGreenbelt will move on from its countryside site to "future proof" the festival beyond 2026.9 hrs agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseSubscription TermsAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
