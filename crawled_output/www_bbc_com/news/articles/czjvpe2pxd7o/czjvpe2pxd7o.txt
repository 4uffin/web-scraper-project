called it a "wild scheme" and "highly sophisticated", as she tried to defraud the Presley family.Graceland, the rock legend's home of 20 years before his death in 1977, is a monument to his musical career and legacy, welcoming a half million visitors each year.The 120-acre property occupies a near-mythical place in American popular culture and bears the distinction of National Historic Landmark. Visitors can view Presley's collection of bedazzled costumes and classic cars, as well as exhibits and events celebrating his work. After Lisa Marie Presley, the singer's daughter and only child, died in 2023, her daughter, Riley Keough, inherited Graceland. However, in 2024, a mysterious company called Naussany Investments claimed that before her death, Ms Presley took out a $3.8m (£3m) loan using Graceland as collateral, then failed to pay.Prosecutors say that company was actually a fabrication. Findley, 54, used several aliases to pose as the bogus lender, and threatened to foreclose on Graceland and auction the compound – unless the Presley family settled the claim for $2.85m.They alleged Findley went so far as to file a fake creditor's claim in California, submit false loan documents in Tennessee, and publish a foreclosure sale notice in a local newspaper.Elvis Presley Enterprises, which runs Graceland, said at the time that no such loan existed. Ms Keough, an actress, took legal action to halt the auction.A judge later stopped the sale.According to Findley's indictment, when the case made national headlines, she falsely claimed to Ms Keough's attorneys that a Nigerian identity thief had perpetrated the scheme.Federal authorities arrested Findley in August 2024 and later charged her with mail fraud and aggravated identify theft. Pleading guilty to mail fraud in February, she told the judge she accepted responsibility for her actions.United StatesMusicRelatedAmerica's blame game over Canada's wildfire smoke misses the point, experts sayColombia's president calls US attacks on alleged drug boats 'act of tyranny''There's no way we can afford $100,000': Small firms scramble over H-1B visa feesMore from the BBC7 mins agoRihanna and A$AP Rocky welcome birth of their first daughterThe celebrity pair announced the birth of Rocki Irish Mayers on Instagram in a post that included a miniature pair of boxing gloves.7 mins ago17 hrs agoDua Lipa denies firing agent over pro-Israel viewsReports claimed the singer dropped her agent after he urged Glastonbury to ban Irish band Kneecap.17 hrs ago1 day agoLulu: Telling the world I'm an alcoholic was liberatingThe Shout singer discloses her alcohol problem - and the family history that contributed to it.1 day ago1 day agoUB40 featuring Ali Campbell announce forest gigsUB40 featuring Ali Campbell will be performing at four forest gigs in June next year.1 day ago1 day agoNew ticket levy could help save city's music sceneA 1% levy could be applied to gig tickets in Bristol generating an estimated £400,000 to £1m every year.1 day agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
