"I know you know my address so send a check. And please take this down and please keep me out of your 'banger' deportation videos."When it comes to immigration my thoughts and heart are a lot more nuanced than this video allows. Bye!"On Tuesday, the department shared a 31-second video clip on X with the caption "Bye", although the post now appears to have been removed.It kicked off with the clip of Von, followed by a claim that two million illegal immigrants had been deported in the first 250 days of President Trump's second term.It then showed Trump saying "They simply stopped coming, they're not coming any more", before ending with a plane taking off with the words "Leave now" written over the image.It comes after British singer Jess Glynne said in July she felt "sick" that the White House had used the viral Jet2holiday advert featuring her song as the audio to a video promoting deportations.The White House posted a clip on X showing handcuffed people being escorted by ICE on to a GlobalX flight.Jet2's advert featuring Glynne's 2015 single Hold my Hand, and a cheery voiceover saying "nothing beats a Jet2 holiday" - which has become a meme - played over the video.Jess Glynne calls White House deportation video with Jet2 song 'sick'GamingPokemon GoTelevisionUS immigrationUS Department of Homeland SecurityRelatedSonic the Hedgehog boss on how the series keeps up to speedThe glitch in Super Mario that obsessed gamersTrolls mock me for having fewer viewers, Fortnite streamer Ninja tells BBCMore from the BBC10 hrs agoDallas shooter intended target to be ICE not detainees - officialsOne detainee was killed and two others critically injured after a shooting at a Dallas ICE facility on Wednesday.10 hrs ago10 hrs agoWeekly quiz: Why did Dani Dyer pull out of Strictly?How much attention did you pay to what happened in the world over the past seven days?10 hrs ago12 hrs agoBBC partly upholds complaints over Bob Vylan setThe broadcast of Bob Vylan's set at Glastonbury broke editorial guidelines in relation to harm and offence.12 hrs ago14 hrs agoDel Boy's bar makes a 'cushty' £22,000 at auctionThe bar, and a suit belonging to Led Zeppelin drummer John Bonham, were among items sold on 25 September.14 hrs ago15 hrs agoSTV to cut 60 jobs and axe north news programme The Scottish broadcaster is seeking £2.5m of savings by next year after announcing a £0.2m loss.15 hrs agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseSubscription TermsAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
