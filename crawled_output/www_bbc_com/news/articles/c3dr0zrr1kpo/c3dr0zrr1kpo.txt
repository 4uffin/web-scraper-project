They ought to be ashamed of themselves."From escalators to teleprompters, Trump piles on criticism at the UNHe also called for the arrest of the people responsible for the escalator incident, referencing an article in the Times that said UN workers joked about turning off the escalators."This was absolutely sabotage... All security tapes at the escalator should be saved, especially the emergency stop button. The Secret Service is involved," Trump added.Mike Waltz, US ambassador to the UN, echoed the president's call for an official probe, saying the incidents were "unacceptable"."The United States will not tolerate threats to our security or dignity at international forums. We expect swift cooperation and decisive action," he wrote on X.On Wednesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt raised concerns that someone deliberately stopped the escalator."If someone at the UN intentionally stopped the escalator as the President and First Lady were stepping on, they need to be fired and investigated immediately," she wrote on X after the incident.Stephane Dujarric, spokesperson for Guterres, said Trump's videographer "may have inadvertently triggered the safety function" while filming the couple.After the escalator mishap, Trump ran into more technical difficulties when he said the teleprompter was not working - although it was restored towards the end of his address."I can only say that whoever's operating this teleprompter is in big trouble," he said.A UN official later told the BBC the White House was operating the teleprompter at the time, bringing their own laptops and plugging them into the UN's system.Trump also referred to audio issues in his lengthy post, saying "the sound was completely off in the Auditorium"."World Leaders, unless they used the interpreters' earpieces, couldn't hear a thing," he added.In response to Trump's comments, a UN official said: ''The sound system was designed to allow people at their seats to hear speeches being translated into six different languages through earpieces."Safety mechanism caused Trump escalator malfunction, UN says Seven years ago Trump's UN audience laughed, this year they were silentTrump criticises countries' migration and climate policies in scathing UN speechKyiv can win all of Ukraine back from Russia, Trump saysUN General AssemblyUnited NationsDonald TrumpUnited StatesRelatedSir Sadiq Khan: Trump is racist and sexistSeven years ago Trump's UN audience laughed, this year they were silentPM must raise Palestinian visa ban with Trump, say Lib DemsMore from the BBC18 mins agoFormer FBI director James Comey indicted on two chargesJames Comey says he is innocent after being accused of lying to Congress in 2020 while testifying about leaks to the media.18 mins ago36 mins agoTrump announces new tariffs on drugs, trucks and kitchen cabinetsThe US president said the move aims to help protect American manufacturers from foreign imports.36 mins ago3 hrs agoUS President Gerald Ford's would-be assassin dies at age 95Sara Jane Moore fired two shots at the Republican president during his visit to San Francisco in 1975.
