He gave Trump 28 days to file an amended complaint.Trump signalled he would sue the New York Times earlier this week in a post on Truth Social, claiming the newspaper has been "allowed to freely lie, smear and defame me for far too long".A spokesperson for President Trump has said that he "will continue to hold the Fake News accountable through this powerhouse lawsuit against the New York Times," the newspaper reported, and added that his legal team will file an amended version to meet the judge's directions.In its own statement, the New York Times said it welcomes the judge's "quick ruling, which recognised that the complaint was a political document rather than a serious legal filing".The paper had said earlier this week that the lawsuit has "no merit.""It lacks any legitimate legal claims and instead is an attempt to stifle and discourage independent reporting," the newspaper said in a statement earlier this week. In his order on Friday, Judge Merryday said the lawsuit filed by Trump is "repetitive" and "superfluous", and contains "florid" allegations.The 85-page lawsuit was filed in federal court in Tampa earlier this week. It also names Penguin Random House LLC - the publisher of a book written by Times reporters last year - and accuses the newspaper of serving as a "mouthpiece" for Democrats.Judge Merryday wrote in his ruling that even if Trump's allegations were proven to be true, and even if the lawsuit were interpreted in a "generous and lenient" manner, the way it was written violates the rules of the court and is "decidedly improper and impermissible."Neither President Trump nor his lawyers have yet responded to Judge Merryday's decision.The lawsuit comes as the Trump administration has faced criticism for what opponents call a crackdown on media unfavourable to the president. On Thursday, the US president suggested some TV networks should have their broadcast licenses "taken away," after ABC suspended late-night TV host Jimmy Kimmel only hours following threats from the Trump administration.Kimmel's suspension came after he made comments about the Charlie Kirk murder suspect, saying Trump supporters had tried to "characterise this kid (the suspect) as anything other than one of them."Other late-night TV hosts backed the comic, with Stephen Colbert calling the removal of Kimmel "blatant censorship".MediaDonald TrumpUnited StatesRelatedTop stars call Jimmy Kimmel suspension 'dark moment' for free speechExpletive messages shown in S4C court case documentsUS TV hosts back Kimmel as Trump threatens networksMore from the BBC1 hr agoTrump designates Antifa a 'domestic terrorist organisation'Trump signed an executive order as part of his crackdown on the "radical left" after the assassination of Charlie Kirk.1 hr ago2 hrs agoWhat is Antifa and why is President Trump targeting it?President Trump has signed an executive order designating Antifa as a domestic terror group, but legal experts have questioned how this will work. 2 hrs ago2 hrs agoUS Supreme Court to revisit laws curtailing Trump's power to fire top officialsThe ruling allows the president to remove the sole Democratic official on the Federal Trade Commission, an independent body set up by Congress.2 hrs ago3 hrs agoTrump urges pregnant women to avoid Tylenol over unproven autism linkSome studies have suggested an association between the two, but experts say there is no causal relationship. 3 hrs ago6 hrs agoWhite House denies border tsar Tom Homan accepted $50,000 bribeThe White House says FBI agents under the last administration had tried to "entrap" Homan.6 hrs agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
