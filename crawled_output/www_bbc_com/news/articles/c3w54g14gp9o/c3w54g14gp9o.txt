Rooney, 34, who won a Sky Arts award for novel Intermezzo, said in a statement read out for her at the ceremony: "I'm advised that I can no longer safely enter the UK without potentially facing arrest".The statement, read by Rooney's publisher Alex Bowler, also said: "I wish that I could be with you this evening to accept the honour in person," adding that she was showing "support for non-violent anti-war protest"."In that context, I want to thank you all the more warmly for honouring my work tonight, and to reiterate my belief in the dignity and beauty of all human life, and my solidarity with the people of Palestine," it also said.Rooney said in August she was using the proceeds from her four books and income from the BBC TV adaptations of Normal People and Conversations with Friends to support Palestine Action.She is not currently working with the BBC on any upcoming projects and has never been a member of staff.The government proscribed Palestine Action under anti-terrorism legislation in July, making membership of or support for the group a criminal offence, punishable by up to 14 years in prison. Funding a group banned under terrorism legislation is an equally serious offence.Many of the group's protests involve break-ins and vandalism - but the government has said three incidents amounted to terrorism, because of the huge scale of the criminal damage allegedly caused.About 30 people are facing trials in relation to these incidents, some of which involved allegations of violence against police and security who tried to intervene.Last week, 890 people were arrested at a demonstration against the ban on Palestine Action in London on Saturday according to the Metropolitan Police.Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said last week: Supporting Palestine and supporting a proscribed terrorist group are not the same thing."She also said she "backed officers" who had arrested those supporting the group.Palestine Action's co-founder is challenging the ban on the group in the High Court. However, next week the government will ask senior judges in the Court of Appeal to stop that going ahead.Police have warned people considering supporting Palestine Action to think through the consequences of receiving a terrorism conviction. They say the ban on one specific group does not interfere with the right to protest about the war in Gaza.Novelist Sally Rooney says she will support Palestine Action despite banArrests at rally against Palestine Action ban rise to 890Irish author Sally Rooney in Israel boycott rowWritingBooksRelated'Reading, more than anything, has shaped who I am'New Hilary Mantel prize to help emerging writersLetter contest aims to inspire young writersMore from the BBC18 hrs ago18 of the best books of 2025 so farFrom an "epic" coming-of-age story to "delicious" dark academia – this is the very best fiction of the year, as chosen by BBC journalists.18 hrs ago2 days agoFinalists revealed for 2025 Booker PrizeThe Sex and the City star is one of the judges for this year's award and has revealed its shortlist.2 days ago3 days agoSchool drops book about race from Y10 reading listThe Hate U Give by Angie Thomas will remain on the list for Year 11 and sixth-form pupils.3 days ago4 days agoCameras ready to roll at Wigtown Book FestivalVisitors to this year's event could find themselves being captured by an award-winning filmmaker.4 days ago5 days agoDating apps, booze and clubbing - Jane Austen's Emma comes into the 21st CenturyA new play based on Austen's classic novel places the book's central character in modern-day Essex.5 days agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseSubscription TermsAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
