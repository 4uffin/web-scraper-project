Rooney, 34, who won a Sky Arts award for novel Intermezzo, said in a statement read out for her at the ceremony: "I'm advised that I can no longer safely enter the UK without potentially facing arrest".The statement, read by Rooney's publisher Alex Bowler, also said: "I wish that I could be with you this evening to accept the honour in person," adding that she was showing "support for non-violent anti-war protest"."In that context, I want to thank you all the more warmly for honouring my work tonight, and to reiterate my belief in the dignity and beauty of all human life, and my solidarity with the people of Palestine," it also said.Rooney said in August she was using the proceeds from her four books and income from the BBC TV adaptations of Normal People and Conversations with Friends to support Palestine Action.She is not currently working with the BBC on any upcoming projects and has never been a member of staff.The government proscribed Palestine Action under anti-terrorism legislation in July, making membership of or support for the group a criminal offence, punishable by up to 14 years in prison. Funding a group banned under terrorism legislation is an equally serious offence.Many of the group's protests involve break-ins and vandalism - but the government has said three incidents amounted to terrorism, because of the huge scale of the criminal damage allegedly caused.About 30 people are facing trials in relation to these incidents, some of which involved allegations of violence against police and security who tried to intervene.Last week, 890 people were arrested at a demonstration against the ban on Palestine Action in London on Saturday according to the Metropolitan Police.Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said last week: Supporting Palestine and supporting a proscribed terrorist group are not the same thing."She also said she "backed officers" who had arrested those supporting the group.Palestine Action's co-founder is challenging the ban on the group in the High Court. However, next week the government will ask senior judges in the Court of Appeal to stop that going ahead.Police have warned people considering supporting Palestine Action to think through the consequences of receiving a terrorism conviction. They say the ban on one specific group does not interfere with the right to protest about the war in Gaza.Novelist Sally Rooney says she will support Palestine Action despite banArrests at rally against Palestine Action ban rise to 890Irish author Sally Rooney in Israel boycott rowWritingBooksRelatedNew Hilary Mantel prize to help emerging writersLetter contest aims to inspire young writersPrince Harry says his 'conscience is clear' over Royal revelationsMore from the BBC14 hrs agoCameras ready to roll at Wigtown Book FestivalVisitors to this year's event could find themselves being captured by an award-winning filmmaker.14 hrs ago2 days agoDating apps, booze and clubbing - Jane Austen's Emma comes into the 21st CenturyA new play based on Austen's classic novel places the book's central character in modern-day Essex.2 days ago4 days agoThe autumn's best films, shows, books and albumsFrom returning pop superstars to Oscar-ready films and big-time celebrity memoirs, here are BBC Culture's recommendations for what to watch, listen to and read for the rest of 2025.4 days ago4 days agoTaliban ban books written by women from Afghan universitiesThe decree also outlaws the teaching of 18 subjects, including human rights and sexual harassment.4 days ago6 days agoCanadian writer Robert Munsch approved for assisted dyingMunsch was diagnosed with dementia in 2021 and also has Parkinson's disease.6 days agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
