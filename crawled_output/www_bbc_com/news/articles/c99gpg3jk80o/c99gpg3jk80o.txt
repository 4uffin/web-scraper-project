"I'm not his spokesperson," he added, noting that he has doctorates in Zulu music and cultural tourism."I have nothing personal against the king."On the question of stick-fighting, he said this was part of Zulu culture but those fighting had to be equals and "I'm not equal to the king".The 64-year-old professor also said he had not done any stick-fighting since before he was a teenager.King Misuzulu was crowned in 2022, after a year-long feud following the death of his father, long-time King Goodwill Zwelithini, and then his mother shortly afterwards.Two of his brothers challenged Misuzulu's claim to the throne but he has been recognised by both the Zulu royal household and the South African state.The throne has no formal political power, but about a fifth of South Africa's 64 million people are Zulu and its monarchy remains hugely influential with a yearly taxpayer-funded budget of more than $4.9m (£3.5m).The Zulu kingdom has a proud history. It is world-famous for defeating British troops during the 1879 battle of Isandlwana.You may also be interested in:How royal divorce papers have shaken the Zulu kingdomThe pomp and celebrations as new Zulu king crownedDeath of a Zulu king: 'He is planted, not buried'Getty Images/BBCGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.Follow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafricaBBC Africa podcastsFocus on AfricaThis Is AfricaSouth AfricaAfricaRelatedSouth African hospital worker arrested with human placentasEngland and South Africa draw T20 series after washoutRecord-breaking Salt helps England to historic win against South AfricaMore from the BBC2 hrs ago'I'm Kenyan, don't shoot' - the athlete who says he was duped into the Russian armyEvans Kibet, now being held in Ukraine after surrendering, says he did not know he was signing up.2 hrs ago10 hrs agoDrone strike on Sudan mosque kills 78, medic tells BBCLocal activists and residents describe the early morning attack on worshippers.10 hrs ago18 hrs agoThe lonely life and death of Delhi's only African elephantFor 24 years, Shankar endured a lonely existence - including at least 13 spent in solitary confinement.18 hrs ago18 hrs agoFans, food and fast feet: Africa's top shotsA selection of the week's best photos from across the African continent and beyond.18 hrs ago1 day agoAt least 10 dead in Lagos high-rise office building fireSome commercial workers in Afriland Towers jumped out of the third and fourth floors when the fire started.1 day agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
