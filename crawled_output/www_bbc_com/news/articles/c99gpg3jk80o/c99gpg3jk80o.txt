"I'm not his spokesperson," he added, noting that he has doctorates in Zulu music and cultural tourism."I have nothing personal against the king."On the question of stick-fighting, he said this was part of Zulu culture but those fighting had to be equals and "I'm not equal to the king".The 64-year-old professor also said he had not done any stick-fighting since before he was a teenager.King Misuzulu was crowned in 2022, after a year-long feud following the death of his father, long-time King Goodwill Zwelithini, and then his mother shortly afterwards.Two of his brothers challenged Misuzulu's claim to the throne but he has been recognised by both the Zulu royal household and the South African state.The throne has no formal political power, but about a fifth of South Africa's 64 million people are Zulu and its monarchy remains hugely influential with a yearly taxpayer-funded budget of more than $4.9m (£3.5m).The Zulu kingdom has a proud history. It is world-famous for defeating British troops during the 1879 battle of Isandlwana.You may also be interested in:How royal divorce papers have shaken the Zulu kingdomThe pomp and celebrations as new Zulu king crownedDeath of a Zulu king: 'He is planted, not buried'Getty Images/BBCGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.Follow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafricaBBC Africa podcastsFocus on AfricaThis Is AfricaSouth AfricaAfricaRelatedSouth Africa police uncover $20m crystal meth labSouth African hospital worker arrested with human placentasEngland and South Africa draw T20 series after washoutMore from the BBC17 hrs agoMurdered Kenyan's friends want UK soldier to face justiceFriends of the stabbed 21-year-old Kenyan woman recount to the BBC events on the night she went missing.17 hrs ago1 day agoMalawi police arrest eight for alleged election fraudOfficials are on high alert after the 2019 presidential election result was annulled due to vote tampering.1 day ago2 days ago'I'm Kenyan, don't shoot' - the athlete who says he was duped into the Russian armyEvans Kibet, now being held in Ukraine after surrendering, says he did not know he was signing up.2 days ago2 days agoDrone strike on Sudan mosque kills 78, medic tells BBCLocal activists and residents describe the early morning attack on worshippers.2 days ago3 days agoThe lonely life and death of Delhi's only African elephantFor 24 years, Shankar endured a lonely existence - including at least 13 spent in solitary confinement.3 days agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
