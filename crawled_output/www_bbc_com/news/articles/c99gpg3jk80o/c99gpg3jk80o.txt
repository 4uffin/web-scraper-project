"I'm not his spokesperson," he added, noting that he has doctorates in Zulu music and cultural tourism."I have nothing personal against the king."On the question of stick-fighting, he said this was part of Zulu culture but those fighting had to be equals and "I'm not equal to the king".The 64-year-old professor also said he had not done any stick-fighting since before he was a teenager.King Misuzulu was crowned in 2022, after a year-long feud following the death of his father, long-time King Goodwill Zwelithini, and then his mother shortly afterwards.Two of his brothers challenged Misuzulu's claim to the throne but he has been recognised by both the Zulu royal household and the South African state.The throne has no formal political power, but about a fifth of South Africa's 64 million people are Zulu and its monarchy remains hugely influential with a yearly taxpayer-funded budget of more than $4.9m (£3.5m).The Zulu kingdom has a proud history. It is world-famous for defeating British troops during the 1879 battle of Isandlwana.You may also be interested in:How royal divorce papers have shaken the Zulu kingdomThe pomp and celebrations as new Zulu king crownedDeath of a Zulu king: 'He is planted, not buried'Getty Images/BBCGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.Follow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafricaBBC Africa podcastsFocus on AfricaThis Is AfricaSouth AfricaAfricaRelatedEngland and South Africa draw T20 series after washoutRecord-breaking Salt helps England to historic win against South AfricaCentury for Salt on record-breaking night for EnglandMore from the BBC11 hrs agoPolice forcibly remove Gambian auditor general in reshuffle rowMomodou Ceesay rejected the president's decision to oust him from the post. 11 hrs ago11 hrs agoMalawi set to vote for next president as cost-of-living bitesCampaigns were overshadowed by price rises and fuel shortages.11 hrs ago15 hrs agoMen jailed for witchcraft murder plot against Zambia's presidentThe pair were sentenced to two years in prison after being found with charms, including a chameleon.15 hrs ago2 days agoPot breaks as Nigerian chef attempts to cook largest jollof rice dishHilda Baci and a team of assistants took nine hours to complete the popular West African dish.2 days ago2 days agoMalawi - where the petrol queue might overshadow the queue to voteWith long petrol queues on city roads, everyday issues dominate in the run-up to Tuesday's vote.2 days agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
