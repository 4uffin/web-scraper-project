"I'm not his spokesperson," he added, noting that he has doctorates in Zulu music and cultural tourism."I have nothing personal against the king."On the question of stick-fighting, he said this was part of Zulu culture but those fighting had to be equals and "I'm not equal to the king".The 64-year-old professor also said he had not done any stick-fighting since before he was a teenager.King Misuzulu was crowned in 2022, after a year-long feud following the death of his father, long-time King Goodwill Zwelithini, and then his mother shortly afterwards.Two of his brothers challenged Misuzulu's claim to the throne but he has been recognised by both the Zulu royal household and the South African state.The throne has no formal political power, but about a fifth of South Africa's 64 million people are Zulu and its monarchy remains hugely influential with a yearly taxpayer-funded budget of more than $4.9m (£3.5m).The Zulu kingdom has a proud history. It is world-famous for defeating British troops during the 1879 battle of Isandlwana.You may also be interested in:How royal divorce papers have shaken the Zulu kingdomThe pomp and celebrations as new Zulu king crownedDeath of a Zulu king: 'He is planted, not buried'Getty Images/BBCGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.Follow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafricaBBC Africa podcastsFocus on AfricaThis Is AfricaSouth AfricaAfricaRelatedSouth Africa recall De Kock as he ends retirementSouth Africa police uncover $20m crystal meth labSouth African hospital worker arrested with human placentasMore from the BBC4 hrs agoWhy a tiny island's fate could decide Seychelles' next presidentIndia, Qatari royals, China and ecologists have their own, very different, views on Assumption Island's future.4 hrs ago16 hrs agoFrench navy seizes nearly 10 tonnes of cocaine off West African coastFrench authorities say the "remarkable seizure" was found on board a fishing boat following a tip-off.16 hrs ago20 hrs agoMalawi's ex-president wins election in comeback at age 85Peter Mutharika defeated the incumbent, Lazarus Chakwera, the election commission announces.20 hrs ago21 hrs agoThe professor who beat fraud allegations to become Malawi's president…againThe president-elect of the southern African nation has a long and controversial political career.21 hrs ago1 day agoSomalia's president: They tried to kill me five timesSomalia's President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud says he is a prime target of the Islamist group al-Shabab. 1 day agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseSubscription TermsAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
