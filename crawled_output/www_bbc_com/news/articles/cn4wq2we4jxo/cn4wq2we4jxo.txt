They were then transferred to the laboratories of the Ephorate of Underwater Antiquities in Athens, where conservation work will continue.Some objects identified in the original plan could not be recovered because of their condition and location.Artefacts will eventually go on display at the new National Museum of Underwater Antiquities in Piraeus, in a section dedicated to World War One.The Britannic was the third of the White Star Line company's Olympic class of steamships, along with the RMS Titanic and RMS Olympic.The vessel was requisitioned by the British Admiralty during the war to serve as a hospital ship. On 16 November 1916, it struck a German mine off the island of Kea and sank in less than an hour.Of the 1,065 people on board, 30 died when two lifeboats were pulled into the ship's propellers.Allan C Green via State Library VictoriaThe Britannic served as a hospital ship in World War OneTitanic sister ship items sold at auctionRoyal NavyGreeceShipwrecksRelatedD-Day veteran to receive France's top honourD-Day veteran turns 100 with 15,000 cardsWhy US naval 'victory' off British coast is celebrated 246 years onMore from the BBC2 days agoPhone spyware scandal in Greece moves to court as critics claim cover-upFour people go on trial accused of misdemeanours but opponents ask why no government officials have been charged.2 days ago13 Sep 2025Neo-Nazi Golden Dawn leader released from prison earlyNikos Michaloliakos, 67, who gave Hitler salutes at rallies, is allowed to serve the remainder of his sentence from home.13 Sep 20259 Sep 2025Restored navy warship's flag to go on displayThe University of Wolverhampton says the flag is ready to go on display after being restored.9 Sep 20256 Sep 2025One of the world's most sacred places is being turned into a luxury mega-resortThe biblical site of Mount Sinai in Egypt is at the heart of an unholy row over plans to build a huge new tourism project.6 Sep 20252 Sep 2025Captain Scott’s famous polar shipwreck as never seen beforeThe Terra Nova carried Captain Scott and his men on their doomed expedition to the South Pole.2 Sep 2025British Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseSubscription TermsAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
