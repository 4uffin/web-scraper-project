You're joking, right????Robinson: I am still ok my love, but am stuck in orem for a little while longer yet. Shouldn't be long until I can come home, but I gotta grab my rifle still.

I am sorry to involve you.Roommate: you weren't the one who did it right????Robinson: I am, I'm sorryRoommate: I thought they caught the person?Robinson: no, they grabbed some crazy old dude, then interrogated someone in similar clothing.
