Lina al-Maghrebi, 32, a mother of three from the city's Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood, told the BBC she had resisted leaving her home - despite the danger - until she received a phone call from an Israeli officer ordering her to evacuate. "I was forced to sell my jewellery to cover the cost of displacement and a tent," she said. "It took us 10 hours to reach Khan Younis, and we paid 3,500 shekels (£735) for the ride. The line of cars and trucks seemed endless."Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said a "powerful operation" had been launched in Gaza City, which he described as Hamas's last major stronghold.The Israeli military has designated al-Rashid coastal road as the only permitted route for civilians to use to evacuate. Many have described severe congestion, endless queues of cars and trucks, and long delays, with families stranded on the roadside while airstrikes continue overhead.The operation has drawn widespread international condemnation, including from the UN human rights chief and German foreign minister. Navi Pillay: "The committee concluded that Israel has committed genocide against the Palestinian people"UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper called the offensive "utterly reckless and appalling", saying it would "only bring more bloodshed, kill more innocent civilians and endanger the remaining hostages".But US Secretary of State Marco Rubio appeared to offer tacit support for Israel's operation during a joint press conference with Netanyahu on Monday, saying the US preferred a negotiated end to the war, but that "sometimes when you're dealing with a group of savages like Hamas, that's not possible".Israel's ramped up offensive comes as a United Nations commission of inquiry released a report on Tuesday that says Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. Israel categorically rejected the report.Anadolu via Getty ImagesHundreds of thousands of people have fled Gaza City in recent weeksNivin Imad al-Din, 38, a mother of five, said she fled south after Israeli warplanes dropped evacuation leaflets in her neighbourhood, though her husband refused to leave their home."I couldn't take my furniture with me because I couldn't afford the cost of a large truck," she explained. "Leaving everything behind was the hardest decision I've ever made."The cost of displacement has surged far beyond the reach of most households. Residents said renting a small truck now costs around 3,000 shekels (£630), while a tent for five people sells for about 4,000 shekels (£840). With most families deprived of income since the war began, some are forced to walk for miles or remain in their homes despite the risks.Overnight into Tuesday, Israeli warplanes carried out a wave of heavy airstrikes across Gaza City, with concentrated bombardment on the central al-Daraj neighbourhood, the Beach refugee camp in the west, and Sheikh Radwan in the north.The attacks were accompanied by artillery fire, drone fire and helicopter gunship activity. The Israel Defense Forces said it was "gradually" moving into Gaza City as part of the "next phase" of its offensive.It said air and ground forces would be part of this next stage of the military's operation, with the number of troops increasing day-by-day.Residents described the overnight strikes as "hell". Ghazi al-Aloul, a displaced resident from northern Gaza, told the BBC he is now sleeping at the entrance of al-Quds Hospital in Tel al-Hawa, southwest Gaza. "I did not choose this," he said. "I was forced after leaving the home where my family and I had been sheltering for nearly a month after fleeing the north"."The bombardment has been insane for hours, and the army is threatening to demolish several residential buildings in the area." Anadolu via Getty ImagesIn the past few days, some have been forced to flee down the coastal road at nightSami Abu Dalal, from al-Daraj in central Gaza, described the night as "extremely difficult"."Whole residential blocks were levelled on top of their inhabitants, leaving many dead, missing, or injured," he said.He said Israel was advancing on three fronts - and was accompanied by the use of booby-trapped vehicles, intense airstrikes, and heavy shelling. Meanwhile, Apache helicopters hovered over different parts of the city, firing continuously.More on this storyIsrael has committed genocide in Gaza, UN commission of inquiry saysJeremy Bowen: UN genocide report a blunt indictment of Israel's actions in GazaIsrael escalates bombardment as defence minister says 'Gaza is burning'Israel-Gaza warIsraelGazaHamasRelatedUK formally recognises Palestinian stateUK rewarding Hamas, says mother of freed British-Israeli hostageWatch: Keir Starmer says UK recognises Palestinian stateMore from the BBC10 hrs agoCanada first G7 nation to recognise Palestinian state After Canada, the UK and Australia also announced they'd taken the major step of recognition, which Israel has decried as rewarding terror.10 hrs ago12 hrs agoWhat does recognising a Palestinian state mean?The UK, Australia and Canada have recognised a Palestinian state, while France and other countries are set to do so in the coming days.12 hrs ago20 hrs agoIsrael will occupy more West Bank land, but recognition matters, mayor tells BBCPalestinians living in the West Bank describe the impact of Israel's occupying control.20 hrs ago1 day agoWhy Starmer decided the time was right to recognise a Palestinian stateThe PM had signalled a shift in policy unless Israel took steps including agreeing to a ceasefire in Gaza.1 day ago2 days agoPortugal confirms it will recognise Palestinian stateA host of countries, including France and the UK, are expected to do the same when world leaders gather at the UN General Assembly next week.2 days agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
