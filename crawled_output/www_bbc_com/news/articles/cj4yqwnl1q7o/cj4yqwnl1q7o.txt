Her family said they had worried for decades, not knowing what had happened to her.Earlier this year, a woman found dead in a poultry shed in Spain was identified as
33-year-old Ainoha Izaga Ibieta Lima, from Paraguay in South America. The circumstances surrounding her death were described by police as "unexplained".Police are still trying to find the identities of another 44 women found dead in the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, France, Italy and Spain. The majority of them are murder victims, believed to have been aged between 15 and 30.Interpol said increased global migration and human trafficking had led to more people being reported missing outside their countries, which can make identifying bodies more challenging.An official at the agency told the BBC that women were "disproportionately affected by gender-based violence, including domestic violence, sexual assault, and trafficking".More on this storyInterpol asks public to help crack murdered women cold casesFingerprints identify Paraguayan woman seven years after deathFamily identify 1992 murder victim by flower tattooEuropeSpainMissing peopleRussiaRelatedDrone attacks leave Denmark exposed - and searching for responseGreece extradites oligarch to Moldova in $1bn fraud caseKyiv can win all of Ukraine back from Russia, Trump saysMore from the BBC10 hrs agoTrump urges Turkey to stop buying Russian oil as Erdogan chases deal on F-35sThe US president suggests the US could lift sanctions on Turkey and allow it to buy F-35 jets.10 hrs ago18 hrs agoMurderer held in Spain after 17 months on the runWilliam Hunter, who killed Elliot Mulligan in Portugal, sparked a huge manhunt when he skipped bail.18 hrs ago19 hrs agoAppeal for help to find mum missing for a yearNazire Koreli was last seen in Bexley last September, and was reported missing in February.19 hrs ago1 day agoThe sun sets on India's iconic and controversial Soviet fighter jetMiG-21 served in all conflicts with Pakistan since 1965 and was later known for a high crash rate.1 day ago1 day agoRussia will expand aggression beyond Ukraine if not stopped, Zelensky warns Vladimir Putin "will keep driving the war forward wider and deeper", the Ukrainian president tells the UN. 1 day agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseSubscription TermsAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
