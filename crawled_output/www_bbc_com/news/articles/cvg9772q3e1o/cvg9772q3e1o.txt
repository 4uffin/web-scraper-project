But our greatest joy will come when there are no [political] prisoners in Egypt," she added.In an interview with the BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Tuesday morning, his sister Mona said she was "impatiently waiting for the time to come and preparing to go to the airport to take the plane and go see Alaa"."It has been the longest 12 years of this madness, and nightmare and heartache, and also journey full of love and ups and downs. And now Alaa is out, Alaa is free, Alaa is home."Her brother first rose to prominence during the 2011 uprising in Egypt that forced long-time President Hosni Mubarak to resign.He has spent most of his time in prison since 2014, the year after Sisi led the military's overthrow of Egypt's first democratically elected president, Muslim Brotherhood leader Mohammed Morsi, following anti-government protests.While in power, Sisi has overseen what human rights groups say is an unprecedented crackdown on dissent that has led to the detention of tens of thousands of people.In 2015, a court sentenced Abdel Fattah to five years in prison for participating in an unauthorised protest.In September 2019, only six months after he had been released on probation, he was arrested again and held in pre-trial detention for more than two years.He was convicted in December 2021 of "spreading false news" for sharing a post about a prisoner dying of torture and handed another five-year sentence following a trial that human rights groups said was grossly unfair.Although Abdel Fattah acquired British citizenship in 2021, Egypt never allowed him a consular visit by British diplomats.In May, the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention - a panel of independent human rights experts – found that Abdel Fattah had been arbitrarily arrested for exercising his right to freedom of expression, had not been given a fair trial and had remained in detention for his political opinions.The Egyptian government said he had been afforded "all fair trial rights" and that his sentence would be completed in January 2027.But two weeks ago, Sisi unexpectedly ordered authorities to study a petition from Egypt's National Council for Human Rights (NCHR) for the release of Abdel Fattah and six others, which the institution said it had submitted "in light of the humanitarian and health conditions experienced by [their] families".It gave no details but Leila Soueif was twice admitted to hospital in London during her extensive hunger strike, which she ended in July after receiving assurances from the UK government that it was doing everything it could to secure her son's release.Mona Seif praised the "enormous solidarity" with her family's campaign across the world, as well as the pressure applied by the UK government and British MPs. But she said she believed it was her mother's "terrible and terrifying, but also incredible" hunger strike that ultimately led to the presidential pardon.She said she did not yet know whether her brother would be allowed to leave Egypt to be reunited with his 13-year-old son, Khaled, who lives in Brighton."[Alaa] missed all his childhood. He needs to be with Khaled as a teenager, to take Khaled to school, to take Khaled to the beach, to do all the things they have been robbed of the opportunity to do."She also said her brother's release was "not just about a personal moment"."I'm hoping it can be a moment of collective hope," she explained. "There might be a revision to the state of the thousands and thousands of people who are languishing in prison for years and are waiting for the same kind of happiness, to be reunited with their family," she added.The NCHR said the pardon was "a step that underscores a growing commitment to reinforcing the principles of swift justice and upholding fundamental rights and freedoms", while Egyptian human rights lawyer Ahmed Ragheb said he hoped it would "pave the way for granting amnesty to those who have been sentenced in cases related to freedom of expression".Human rightsEgyptUplifting storiesRelatedIsrael has committed genocide in Gaza, UN commission of inquiry saysSouth Korea to probe potential human rights abuses in US raid'True hero' wins BBC Jersey Make a Difference AwardMore from the BBC23 hrs agoEgypt's president pardons British-Egyptian activist Alaa Abdel FattahThe British-Egyptian activist is one of six people whose sentences President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi commuted, according to state media.23 hrs ago5 days agoEgypt says 3,000-year-old bracelet was stolen and melted downA specialist took the gold artefact from a Cairo museum and sold it through a jeweller, officials say.5 days ago6 days agoSearch for ancient Egyptian gold bracelet missing from Cairo museumA photo of the 3,000-year-old bracelet has been sent to airports, seaports and border crossings to stop it being smuggled out of the country.6 days ago10 Sep 2025Marmoush to miss Manchester derby with knee injuryManchester City will be without forward Omar Marmoush for Sunday's Manchester derby after the Egyptian suffers a knee injury on international duty. 10 Sep 20257 Sep 2025Ethiopia outfoxes Egypt over the Nile's waters with its mighty damEthiopia is set to inaugurate a mega dam that has stoked tensions with Egypt.7 Sep 2025British Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
