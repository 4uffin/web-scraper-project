Teasing the Peaky Blinders film, which has been written by the show's creator Steven Knight, Murphy said: "I think it's better to keep it under wraps, keep it a surprise."Viewers have seen Murphy, 49, lead the Shelby organised crime gang with tortured efficiency since 2013 and across six series.The actor said the length of time he has played Shelby has been "defining" for him."To grow older with a character, you don't really get to do that, and that is the joy of long-form television," he said."We never anticipated that the TV show would have that impact, would be so adored and have that longevity. It is defining."Since the original series concluded in 2022, Murphy has also starred in Small Things Like These and won an Oscar for his leading role in Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer.Discussing the key to Peaky Blinders' success, Murphy said it is a sort of "magic". "Mostly the writing, I think, but also it was a moment in time."He added: "The beauty of that show is that I have gone off and done other things in the meantime and played lots of other characters."BBC StudiosMurphy's Tommy Shelby will be on the big screen soon, Netflix has saidAmong them is Steve, the headteacher of a reform school in 1996, battling the emotions and behaviour of the teenage boys living there as well as his own personal demons. The new film chronicles a single day at the school where what can go wrong, does go wrong. A documentary crew with questionable morals is filming, a local MP is visiting and both Steve (played by Murphy) and Shy (Jay Lycurgo), one of the pupils, receive devastating news.Both characters are pushed to the brink, taking the audience on an emotional and often heartbreaking journey.Murphy described the film as a love letter to teachers, as they are "custodians of next generation."NetflixSteve is set in a 1990s reform school for boysThe similarities between Shy and Steve are apparent throughout - even if they are at different stages of life. "It's a flip-side of a coin what these characters are experiencing and they just can't reach each other," Murphy explained.The film's themes touch on education in challenging circumstances, men's mental health and adolescent violence. Even though it is set 30 years ago, "It is just demonstrating that this stuff is always there," he added"The conversations are kind of manifold and different," Murphy said of the reaction to the film so far. "Everyone sees it through the prism of their own life experience".Steve was based on the 2023 novella, Shy, written by Max Porter. The author has adapted the story for the screen.He and Murphy previously worked together on the play, Grief Is the Thing with Feathers, also based on an original book by Porter.As for Lycurgo, he will also appear in the upcoming Peaky Blinders film, but followed Murphy's lead in keeping the details secret.Steve is in cinemas now and will be released on Netflix next month.More on CultureLeonardo DiCaprio on why his new film addresses 'divisiveness in our culture'Mark Ronson on being a night person - and Lady Gaga trashing his carJoy Crookes 'let go' of perfectionism - her music is better for itTelevisionPeaky BlindersCultureFilmTVRelatedWeekly quiz: Why did Dani Dyer pull out of Strictly?BBC partly upholds complaints over Bob Vylan setDel Boy's bar makes a 'cushty' £22,000 at auctionMore from the BBC10 hrs agoEmma Watson says she still loves JK Rowling despite rift over trans viewsHowever, the Harry Potter author appears to rebuff the actress's conciliatory comments.10 hrs ago11 hrs agoAustralian film altered in China to make gay couple straightA scene featuring a same-sex couple was digitally altered to depict a heterosexual couple.11 hrs ago13 hrs agoFailed sale of famous studios cost taxpayers £430kThe failed sale of the famous Bottle Yard studios in south Bristol cost £430k to Bristol taxpayers.13 hrs ago19 hrs agoMovie festival gives platform to new filmmakersWorcester Film Festival showcases emerging filmmakers as part of its programme of 120 screenings.19 hrs ago23 hrs agoMatthew McConaughey on starring with his family in film about California's deadliest wildfireThe actor plays a school bus driver trapped in US wildfires, appearing with his real mother and son.23 hrs agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseSubscription TermsAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
