It now lies in ruins, pockmarked by craters, with burned-out wards and bullet holes.But inside medics are working beyond full stretch. Many of the beds do not even have mattresses, medicines are in short supply and the casualties are endless."It's just a mass murder, a killing, a torture, a nightmare," Dr Nada Abu Alrub, an emergency specialist from Australia volunteering at the hospital, told the BBC in a video call on Tuesday.She said they were operating on severely wounded patients with "minimal to hardly no anaesthesia"."No painkillers as well, with their limbs hanging with a piece of skin and the tendon. Brain matter out. Organs are out. It's horrific," she added.Last week, she said, doctors had to conduct an emergency Caesarean on a nine-month pregnant woman whose head had been blown off. They managed to save her daughter."The baby was a bit bradycardic, so her heart rate was low," she recalled. "She was transferred to another hospital."Dr Saya Aziz, an Australian anaesthetist, described how a six-year-old boy with a fractured arm and leg had been waiting for three days for an operation to place external fixators on them because the hospital's only orthopaedic surgeon had to prioritise more serious cases."Every couple of hours there are multiple amputation cases with massive resuscitation. It's life or limb, literally," she told the BBC."And you go in and you're trying to anaesthetise them [while] they're swatting flies in theatre."There's blood over the beds. There's no equipment. There's no replacements. And you can see the sorrow and the sadness of the healthcare workers."ReutersBetween 320,000 and 640,000 people are estimated to have fled northern Gaza since mid-August Outside the hospital, Israel's tanks are advancing, as the ground offensive against Hamas in Gaza City continues.One video posted on social media showed a tank at Hamid junction in the Rimal neighbourhood, which is less than 500m from al-Shifa.Another video showed troops to the south, only 700m from the city centre.Palestinian journalist Fathi Sabah, who lives in southern Gaza but owns an apartment in the city's southern Tal al-Hawa neighbourhood, said members of his family had narrowly escaped an Israeli incursion."My wife and son went to our flat to collect some belongings. They suddenly found themselves trapped as tanks surrounded the area," he said."They lived through the hardest night of their lives before escaping through a back door. It's unbelievable how quickly the tanks reached the heart of the city."Around one million Palestinians were estimated to be living in Gaza City before Israel announced its plans for the offensive last month.The UN says more than 320,000 have fled southwards since then, while the Israeli military puts the figure at 640,000.The Israeli military has told people to head south for their safety to a designated "humanitarian area" in al-Mawasi, where it has said medical care, water and food will be provided.However, witnesses say the coastal al-Rashid road is severely congested and that families are struggling for hours to complete the journey.The cost of evacuation has also reportedly soared to more than $3,000 (£2,200) per family - far beyond the reach of most residents.The UN has also said the tent camps in al-Mawasi are overcrowded and unsafe, and that southern hospitals are operating at several times their capacity."The tanks are only a few metres from my house but I cannot afford the cost of fleeing," Sultan Nassar, a 62-year-old father of five from the Sabra neighbourhood, told the BBC. "Death is everywhere, in the north and in the south."The Palestine Red Crescent Society said the oxygen station at al-Quds hospital in Tal al-Hawa had ceased operating after being struck by gunfire from Israeli forces, and that it only had enough pre-filled oxygen cylinders to last three days.Israeli military vehicles were currently positioned at the southern gate of the hospital, preventing anyone from entering or leaving, it added.The Israeli military said it was looking into the report.On Monday, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said the Israeli advance and bombardment had forced al-Rantisi children's hospital and the nearby St John Eye hospital in the northern Nasr neighbourhood to evacuate patients and shut down.The Jordanian armed forces also decided to close their field hospital in Tal al-Hawa and relocate it to southern Gaza, with Jordan's state news agency reporting that shelling and other intense explosions in the vicinity had damaged the facility and some medical equipment.The Palestinian Medical Relief Society's primary healthcare centre in Gaza City was destroyed in an Israeli air strike which reportedly injured two health workers, the World Health Organization said. The centre was providing blood services, trauma care, cancer medications, and chronic disease treatment.The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.At least 65,382 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's health ministry.Trump to address UN General Assembly after France recognises Palestinian state'We need solutions': Palestinians in West Bank fear recognition is not enough'The bombing has been insane': Palestinians scramble to flee Israeli assault on Gaza CityIsrael-Gaza warIsraelPalestinian territoriesHamasAustraliaRelatedTrump says he 'will not allow' Netanyahu to annex West BankMicrosoft cuts off some services used by Israeli military unitPalestinian president says ready to work with Trump for two-state peace planMore from the BBC5 hrs agoIsraeli strike on Yemen's Houthis reportedly kills eightThe Israeli military says its "most powerful strike" in Yemen targeted security and military targets, but the Houthis say civilian facilities were hit.5 hrs ago13 hrs agoPalestinians in West Bank stranded as Israel shuts only international crossingMany have been unable to leave the territory since the Allenby Bridge crossing was shut indefinitely on Wednesday.13 hrs ago19 hrs agoBBC and news agencies launch film calling on Israel to allow foreign journalists into GazaIsrael does not allow foreign journalists into Gaza independently, citing security grounds.19 hrs ago1 day agoIsraeli strikes kill dozens in Gaza City, hospitals say, as offensive expandsWomen and children were among 20 people who died when a strike hit a building sheltering displaced families, first responders say.1 day ago1 day agoKindergarten parents told to pay thousands for kids' art - sparking uproar and a midnight heistThe debt-ridden centre said the money would go towards paying overdue bills.1 day agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseSubscription TermsAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
