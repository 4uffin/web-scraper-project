However he denies discussing plans to stage an insurrection.In late February police raided several locations in Romania, uncovering a cache of weapons, gold and cash, with which it is alleged Potra's group were planning to stage a violent power grab.Prosecutors say Potra is currently not in the country and may seek asylum in Russia.Georgescu, 63, came a surprise first in the first round of Romania's presidential election last November.That result was annulled by the Constitutional Court just days before the second round was due to take place amid allegations of Russian interference.Romanian intelligence services suggested his presence and popularity on social media had been boosted by a mass influence operation – conducted from abroad – to interfere with the result of the vote.At a press conference, prosecutor general Florenta described the annulled 2024 election as "the result of a hybrid war orchestrated by Russia."He alleged that cyberattacks on airports and public institutions coincided with an online disinformation campaign waged through troll farms, bots, and AI-generated content.According to investigators, more than 2,000 Facebook pages were used to amplify pro-Georgescu messaging, while TikTok networks of over 20,000 automated accounts boosted his campaign in the days before the vote.After Georgescu was barred from registering as a candidate his ally George Simion, the leader of the far-right AUR party, stood in his place in the May rerun.Simion won a dramatic first-round victory but was eventually beaten into second place by Nicusor Dan, the liberal, pro-EU mayor of Bucharest, in the run-off.Georgescu has not yet commented on the charges, although this month he accused the Romanian authorities of ruling through "deceit, intrigue and division".President Dan said the report by prosecutors was "proof" that Russia had exercised "systematic disinformation" in Romania and had tried to influence the 2024 election.A date for Georgescu's trial has not yet been given, but it could begin in early 2026.Fear and anger mount as 'battle for the soul of Romanian democracy' loomsRomania's cancelled presidential election and why it mattersRomania hit by major election influence campaign and Russian cyber-attacksEuropeRomaniaRelatedI took a job on a whim on New Year's Eve - and ended up stranded at sea for six monthsRAF jets join Nato air defence mission over PolandEstonia seeks Nato consultation after Russian jets violate airspaceMore from the BBC7 days agoRomania becomes second Nato country to report Russian drone in its airspaceUkraine's President Zelensky called the incursion "an obvious expansion of the war by Russia".7 days ago24 Aug 2025Were masterpieces worth £100m really found under a pensioner's bed?Three works attributed to Malevich are on show in Bucharest but an art scholar says the story behind them is problematic.24 Aug 20255 Aug 2025Ion Iliescu: Romania's first democratic leader with a divisive legacyHis three terms saw the tumultuous birth of modern Romania as it moved from communism to democracy.5 Aug 20255 Aug 2025Former Romanian President Ion Iliescu dies aged 95He was Romania's first freely elected leader after communism fell in 1989, and later faced charges of crimes against humanity.5 Aug 20251 Aug 2025Children and parents praise Romanian classesFamilies say lessons have helped them feel closer to their Romanian culture and heritage.1 Aug 2025British Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
