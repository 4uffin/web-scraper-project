"California will continue to stand for the rule of law and for basic freedoms."The legislation comes after the Supreme Court ruled that immigration enforcement stops in LA could continue for the time being without officers needing reasonable suspicion that a person may not be in the US legally.That ruling allows officers to question and detain people based solely on their race, language or job while a legal challenge to recent immigration raids works its way through the courts.As well as the ban on face coverings, a new bill also requires law enforcement officials to identify themselves while conducting duties by both name and badge number.Other bills signed by Newsom on Saturday prohibit school officials and employees from allowing federal agents conducting immigration enforcement to enter school sites without a warrant, court order or judicial subpoena.Families will also need to be informed when officers arrive at their children's schools. Student information and classrooms are also protected under these new laws.Non-public areas of hospitals and emergency rooms are also off-limits to officers who do not have judicial warrants or court orders."Immigrants have rights and we have the right to stand up and push back," Newsom said. In a statement on Saturday, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin called California's new legislation "despicable" and a "flagrant attempt to endanger our officers".She said the officers at ICE and other federal law enforcement agencies "put their lives on the line every day" to do their jobs."Make no mistake, this type of rhetoric is contributing to the surge in assaults of officers through their repeated vilification and demonization."This is not the first time local officials have challenged the White House.In August, the mayor of Chicago signed an order detailing how the city will resist a potential immigration crackdown threatened by the Trump administration.More on this storyPerfect storm as Trump's mass deportation drive collides with city of immigrantsRelentless immigration raids are changing California's way of lifeUS immigrationDonald TrumpUnited StatesCaliforniaRelated'There's no way we can afford $100,000': Small firms scramble over H-1B visa fees'Anti-ICE' message on ammunition at Dallas shooting that killed immigration detaineeH-1B visa changes may give Canada an opportunity.
