"California will continue to stand for the rule of law and for basic freedoms."The legislation comes after the Supreme Court ruled that immigration enforcement stops in LA could continue for the time being without officers needing reasonable suspicion that a person may not be in the US legally.That ruling allows officers to question and detain people based solely on their race, language or job while a legal challenge to recent immigration raids works its way through the courts.As well as the ban on face coverings, a new bill also requires law enforcement officials to identify themselves while conducting duties by both name and badge number.Other bills signed by Newsom on Saturday prohibit school officials and employees from allowing federal agents conducting immigration enforcement to enter school sites without a warrant, court order or judicial subpoena.Families will also need to be informed when officers arrive at their children's schools. Student information and classrooms are also protected under these new laws.Non-public areas of hospitals and emergency rooms are also off-limits to officers who do not have judicial warrants or court orders."Immigrants have rights and we have the right to stand up and push back," Newsom said. In a statement on Saturday, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin called California's new legislation "despicable" and a "flagrant attempt to endanger our officers".She said the officers at ICE and other federal law enforcement agencies "put their lives on the line every day" to do their jobs."Make no mistake, this type of rhetoric is contributing to the surge in assaults of officers through their repeated vilification and demonization."This is not the first time local officials have challenged the White House.In August, the mayor of Chicago signed an order detailing how the city will resist a potential immigration crackdown threatened by the Trump administration.More on this storyPerfect storm as Trump's mass deportation drive collides with city of immigrantsRelentless immigration raids are changing California's way of lifeUS immigrationDonald TrumpUnited StatesCaliforniaRelatedDallas shooter intended target to be ICE not detainees - officials'Anti-ICE' message on ammunition at Dallas shooting that killed immigration detaineePokémon did not give permission for ICE deportation videoMore from the BBC35 mins agoTrump announces new tariffs on drugs, trucks and kitchen cabinetsThe US president said the move aims to help protect American manufacturers from foreign imports.35 mins ago1 hr agoComey indictment escalates Trump's promise of political retributionThe criminal case against Comey fulfils the president's desire to seek retribution and further raises concerns about abuse of power.1 hr ago2 hrs agoWatch: 'I'm not afraid', says James Comey after indictmentThe former FBI director said he had "great confidence in the federal judicial system" after being indicted on two charges.2 hrs ago2 hrs agoFormer FBI director James Comey indicted on two chargesJames Comey says he is innocent after being accused of lying to Congress in 2020 while testifying about leaks to the media.2 hrs ago6 hrs agoUS President Gerald Ford's would-be assassin dies at age 95Sara Jane Moore fired two shots at the Republican president during his visit to San Francisco in 1975.
