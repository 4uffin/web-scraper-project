It was the third such strike on alleged drug boats in recent weeks.Trump's statement on Truth Social on Friday said the strike happened in international waters. The US Southern Command's area of responsibility covers most of South America and the Caribbean.Two previous strikes have killed a total of 14 people on boats allegedly from Venezuela.Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has previously condemned the strikes and said his country will defend itself against US "aggression". Trump's post on Friday evening mirrored previous announcements of such strikes. It featured a video showing the boat travelling on a body of water, and seconds later it explodes and bursts into flames."On my Orders, the Secretary of War ordered a lethal kinetic strike on a vessel affiliated with a Designated Terrorist Organization conducting narcotrafficking in the USSOUTHCOM area of responsibility," Trump said. "Intelligence confirmed the vessel was trafficking illicit narcotics, and was transiting along a known narcotrafficking passage enroute to poison Americans," he wrote.
