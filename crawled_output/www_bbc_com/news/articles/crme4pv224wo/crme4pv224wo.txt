It was the third such strike on alleged drug boats in recent weeks.Trump's statement on Truth Social on Friday said the strike happened in international waters. The US Southern Command's area of responsibility covers most of South America and the Caribbean.Two previous strikes have killed a total of 14 people on boats allegedly from Venezuela.Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has previously condemned the strikes and said his country will defend itself against US "aggression". Trump's post on Friday evening mirrored previous announcements of such strikes. It featured a video showing the boat travelling on a body of water, and seconds later it explodes and bursts into flames."On my Orders, the Secretary of War ordered a lethal kinetic strike on a vessel affiliated with a Designated Terrorist Organization conducting narcotrafficking in the USSOUTHCOM area of responsibility," Trump said. "Intelligence confirmed the vessel was trafficking illicit narcotics, and was transiting along a known narcotrafficking passage enroute to poison Americans," he wrote. ""No U.S. Forces were harmed in this strike. STOP SELLING FENTANYL, NARCOTICS, AND ILLEGAL DRUGS IN AMERICA, AND COMMITTING VIOLENCE AND TERRORISM AGAINST AMERICANS!!!"Legal experts previously told the BBC that the fatal strike on the first vessel in international waters may have violated international human rights and maritime law.US strike on 'Venezuela drug boat': What do we know, and was it legal?VenezuelaDonald TrumpDrugs tradeUnited StatesRelatedUS destroys alleged Venezuelan drug boat, killing threeTrump says Venezuelan jets will be shot down if they endanger US shipsJudge rules ending protections for Venezuelan and Haitian migrants is unlawfulMore from the BBC32 mins agoTrump hails Charlie Kirk as 'American hero' as thousands fill memorial serviceKirk's wife, Erika, also delivers a tearful speech in which she says she forgives her husband's alleged killer.32 mins ago1 hr agoWatch: Is America divided?
