Israel launched its war in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.At least 65,000 people have been killed in Israeli attacks since then, almost half of them women and children, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.On Tuesday, a UN commission of inquiry said Israel had committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. Israel's foreign ministry rejected the report and denounced it as "distorted and false".Daniel Meron, Israel's ambassador to the UN, says Israel "categorically rejects the libellous rant"West Bank documentary maker criticises US policy in Oscars speechPalestinian Oscar winner released after attack by Israeli settlers, co-director saysIsrael-Gaza warIsraelThe OscarsFilmRelatedUK formally recognises Palestinian stateUK rewarding Hamas, says mother of freed British-Israeli hostageWatch: Keir Starmer says UK recognises Palestinian stateMore from the BBC10 hrs agoCanada first G7 nation to recognise Palestinian state After Canada, the UK and Australia also announced they'd taken the major step of recognition, which Israel has decried as rewarding terror.10 hrs ago12 hrs agoWhat does recognising a Palestinian state mean?The UK, Australia and Canada have recognised a Palestinian state, while France and other countries are set to do so in the coming days.12 hrs ago15 hrs agoSilver screen posters return home a century onThe movie posters, which date from the 1920s, spent more than a century in a shoe box.15 hrs ago20 hrs agoAn unsung powerhouse of film and TV productionMovie Makers founder Tommy Traylen says its ethos is to "make life easier for crews on location".20 hrs ago20 hrs agoIsrael will occupy more West Bank land, but recognition matters, mayor tells BBCPalestinians living in the West Bank describe the impact of Israel's occupying control.20 hrs agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
