Israel launched its war in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.At least 65,000 people have been killed in Israeli attacks since then, almost half of them women and children, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.On Tuesday, a UN commission of inquiry said Israel had committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. Israel's foreign ministry rejected the report and denounced it as "distorted and false".Daniel Meron, Israel's ambassador to the UN, says Israel "categorically rejects the libellous rant"West Bank documentary maker criticises US policy in Oscars speechPalestinian Oscar winner released after attack by Israeli settlers, co-director saysIsrael-Gaza warIsraelThe OscarsFilmRelatedWhy Starmer decided the time was right to recognise a Palestinian stateStarmer set to announce UK recognition of Palestinian state on SundayPortugal confirms it will recognise Palestinian stateMore from the BBC2 hrs agoHamnet to Sinners: 12 films to look out for as Oscars race beginsThe top contenders for Hollywood’s awards season have emerged following the autumn film festivals.2 hrs ago17 hrs agoI was the poster boy for Tourette's and swore in front of the QueenA new film looks at the life of John Davidson after he found fame in a 1989 documentary17 hrs ago1 day agoI'm nothing like my Peaky Blinders character, says Cillian MurphyIt comes as the Irish actor promotes a new film which follows attempts to turn around a reform school.1 day ago1 day agoHow a man's affair with his mother-in-law became a viral film in IndonesiaNorma, a movie based on a viral true story from TikTok, has become a nationwide obsession.1 day ago2 days agoWhat does recognising a Palestinian state mean?Several countries are expected to officially recognise a Palestinian state in the coming days.2 days agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
