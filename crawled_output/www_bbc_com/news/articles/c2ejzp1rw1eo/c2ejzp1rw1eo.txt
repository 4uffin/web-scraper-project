Israel launched its war in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.At least 65,000 people have been killed in Israeli attacks since then, almost half of them women and children, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.On Tuesday, a UN commission of inquiry said Israel had committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. Israel's foreign ministry rejected the report and denounced it as "distorted and false".Daniel Meron, Israel's ambassador to the UN, says Israel "categorically rejects the libellous rant"West Bank documentary maker criticises US policy in Oscars speechPalestinian Oscar winner released after attack by Israeli settlers, co-director saysIsrael-Gaza warIsraelThe OscarsFilmRelatedTaoiseach criticises presidential candidate for 'justifying' HamasFrance formally recognises Palestinian state Footage shows public executions in Gaza City streetMore from the BBC8 hrs agoClashes break out as Italians strike demanding action over GazaTens of thousands turn out and tensions erupt around Milan's main station where 60 police are reported hurt.8 hrs ago14 hrs agoUK says Israel must not retaliate against Palestinian statehood pushYvette Cooper spoke to the BBC as France and more countries prepare to follow the UK and recognise Palestinian statehood.14 hrs ago14 hrs agoCameras ready to roll at Wigtown Book FestivalVisitors to this year's event could find themselves being captured by an award-winning filmmaker.14 hrs ago17 hrs agoWhat does recognising a Palestinian state mean?The UK, Australia and Canada have recognised a Palestinian state, while France and other countries are set to do so in the coming days.17 hrs ago19 hrs agoJam and Jerusalem meets lights, camera, actionScenes for a new feature film will be shot at the Bondville Model Village, Sewerby, and Flamborough.19 hrs agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
