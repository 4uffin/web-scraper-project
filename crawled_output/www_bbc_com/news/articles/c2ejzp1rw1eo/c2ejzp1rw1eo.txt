Israel launched its war in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.At least 65,000 people have been killed in Israeli attacks since then, almost half of them women and children, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.On Tuesday, a UN commission of inquiry said Israel had committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. Israel's foreign ministry rejected the report and denounced it as "distorted and false".Daniel Meron, Israel's ambassador to the UN, says Israel "categorically rejects the libellous rant"West Bank documentary maker criticises US policy in Oscars speechPalestinian Oscar winner released after attack by Israeli settlers, co-director saysIsrael-Gaza warIsraelThe OscarsFilmRelatedThree students from Gaza arrive in NI to study, minister says 'We need solutions': Palestinians in West Bank fear recognition is not enoughIrish presidential candidate condemns Hamas and Israel More from the BBC4 hrs agoWhat is Hamas and why is it fighting with Israel in Gaza?Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages.4 hrs ago6 hrs agoIsrael and the Palestinians: History of the conflict explainedThe conflict between Israel and the Palestinian people is one of the longest-running in the world.6 hrs ago6 hrs agoEuropean recognition of Palestinian state shows US still only power that countsBritain and France's decision to recognise a Palestinian state is a historic moment, but it only becomes feasible with US support. 6 hrs ago14 hrs agoTrump to address UN General Assembly after France recognises Palestinian stateDonald Trump will address UN leaders on Tuesday, as more European countries look set to join the French policy change.14 hrs ago22 hrs agoClashes break out as Italians strike demanding action over GazaTens of thousands turn out and tensions erupt around Milan's main station where 60 police are reported hurt.22 hrs agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
