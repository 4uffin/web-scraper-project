Israel launched its war in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.At least 65,000 people have been killed in Israeli attacks since then, almost half of them women and children, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.On Tuesday, a UN commission of inquiry said Israel had committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. Israel's foreign ministry rejected the report and denounced it as "distorted and false".Daniel Meron, Israel's ambassador to the UN, says Israel "categorically rejects the libellous rant"West Bank documentary maker criticises US policy in Oscars speechPalestinian Oscar winner released after attack by Israeli settlers, co-director saysIsrael-Gaza warIsraelThe OscarsFilmRelatedTrump says he 'will not allow' Netanyahu to annex West BankMicrosoft cuts off some services used by Israeli military unitPalestinian president says ready to work with Trump for two-state peace planMore from the BBC6 hrs agoIsraeli strike on Yemen's Houthis reportedly kills eightThe Israeli military says its "most powerful strike" in Yemen targeted security and military targets, but the Houthis say civilian facilities were hit.6 hrs ago11 hrs agoEmma Watson says she still loves JK Rowling despite rift over trans viewsHowever, the Harry Potter author appears to rebuff the actress's conciliatory comments.11 hrs ago12 hrs agoAustralian film altered in China to make gay couple straightA scene featuring a same-sex couple was digitally altered to depict a heterosexual couple.12 hrs ago13 hrs agoPalestinians in West Bank stranded as Israel shuts only international crossingMany have been unable to leave the territory since the Allenby Bridge crossing was shut indefinitely on Wednesday.13 hrs ago14 hrs agoFailed sale of famous studios cost taxpayers £430kThe failed sale of the famous Bottle Yard studios in south Bristol cost £430k to Bristol taxpayers.14 hrs agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseSubscription TermsAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
