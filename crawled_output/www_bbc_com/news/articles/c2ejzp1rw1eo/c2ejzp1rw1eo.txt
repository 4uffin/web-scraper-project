Israel launched its war in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.At least 65,000 people have been killed in Israeli attacks since then, almost half of them women and children, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.On Tuesday, a UN commission of inquiry said Israel had committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. Israel's foreign ministry rejected the report and denounced it as "distorted and false".Daniel Meron, Israel's ambassador to the UN, says Israel "categorically rejects the libellous rant"West Bank documentary maker criticises US policy in Oscars speechPalestinian Oscar winner released after attack by Israeli settlers, co-director saysIsrael-Gaza warIsraelThe OscarsFilmRelatedBBC and news agencies launch film calling on Israel to allow foreign journalists into GazaIsraeli strikes kill dozens in Gaza City, hospitals say, as offensive expandsTwenty injured in Yemen drone attack on Israel, rescuers and military sayMore from the BBC7 mins agoMatthew McConaughey on starring with his family in film about California's deadliest wildfireThe actor plays a school bus driver trapped in US wildfires, appearing with his real mother and son.7 mins ago2 hrs agoIt's got Peaky Blinders swagger, says House of Guinness writerThe new Netflix drama tells the story of Ireland's most famous family name at the moment of crisis.2 hrs ago10 hrs agoItaly condemns 'drone attack' on Gaza aid flotilla and deploys frigateItaly's defence minister directs a navy vessel to assist the flotilla's boats after what he says was a drone attack by unidentified perpetrators off Crete.10 hrs ago10 hrs agoIsraeli forces near Gaza City centre as Hamas reportedly prepares for street-to-street fightingThousands of Palestinians have been forced to flee Gaza City since Israel launched its ground offensive last week.10 hrs ago11 hrs agoOscar-winning filmmakers' premiering works at festivalEncounters will showcase local filmmakers and international movies as it celebrates its 30th year.11 hrs agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
