Israel launched its war in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.At least 65,000 people have been killed in Israeli attacks since then, almost half of them women and children, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.On Tuesday, a UN commission of inquiry said Israel had committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. Israel's foreign ministry rejected the report and denounced it as "distorted and false".Daniel Meron, Israel's ambassador to the UN, says Israel "categorically rejects the libellous rant"West Bank documentary maker criticises US policy in Oscars speechPalestinian Oscar winner released after attack by Israeli settlers, co-director saysIsrael-Gaza warIsraelThe OscarsFilmRelatedOne hellscape to another: Gazans tell of dire conditions in Israeli-declared humanitarian zoneFirst students evacuated from Gaza to study in UKTogether for Palestine fundraiser edges closer to £2m targetMore from the BBC2 hrs agoI'm nothing like Peaky's Tommy Shelby, says MurphyIt comes as the Irish actor promotes a new film which follows attempts to turn around a reform school.2 hrs ago2 hrs agoHow a man's affair with his mother-in-law became a viral film in IndonesiaNorma, a movie based on a viral true story from TikTok, has become a nationwide obsession.2 hrs ago3 hrs agoI was the poster boy for Tourette's and swore in front of the QueenA new film looks at the life of John Davidson after he found fame in a 1989 documentary3 hrs ago15 hrs agoWhat does recognising a Palestinian state mean?Several countries are expected to officially recognise a Palestinian state in the coming days.15 hrs ago19 hrs agoUS blocks UN call for Gaza ceasefire for sixth timeWashington's representative says the Security Council resolution does not go far enough in condemning Hamas.19 hrs agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
