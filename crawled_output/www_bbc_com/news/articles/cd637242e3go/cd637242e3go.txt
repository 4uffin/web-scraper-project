White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt denied the accusations, stating that Homan "did absolutely nothing wrong" and was the target of Biden administration's politically motivated attempt to discredit him.Homan is leading efforts to deliver on President Donald Trump's pledge for mass deportations and to stop illegal immigration."Mr Homan never took the $50,000 that you're referring to," Leavitt said at Monday's White House briefing.
"This was another example of the weaponisation of the Biden Department of Justice against one of President Trump's strongest and most vocal supporters in the midst of a presidential campaign."You had FBI agents going undercover to try and entrap one of the president's top allies and supporters, someone who they knew very well would be taking a government position."Leavitt said current FBI Director Kash Patel had ordered an investigation into the matter, which "found zero evidence of illegal activity or criminal wrongdoing"."The president stands by Tom Homan, 100%," she added.White House deputy press secretary Abigail Jackson said on Sunday that Homan was not involved in awarding any contracts.US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the federal agency tasked with securing the American border, referred the BBC back to the White House for questions on the matter.July, 2025: US workers build a new 'secondary' wall in Santa Teresa, New MexicoCiting unnamed sources US media reported that the investigation into Homan began around August 2024 and sprang from an unrelated law enforcement probe.An undercover sting was arranged, and Homan was recorded on audio allegedly accepting $50,000 in a bag from the restaurant chain Cava, the sources reportedly said.FBI director Patel said in a statement on Saturday: "This matter originated under the previous administration and was subjected to a full review by FBI agents and Justice Department prosecutors."They found no credible evidence of any criminal wrongdoing."The New York Times reports that the Trump justice department shut down the case amid doubts as to whether prosecutors could prove Homan had done anything illegal, as he was not in government at the time of the incident.He ran a consulting firm, Homeland Strategic Consulting, which drew scrutiny from Democrats as he was picked to become Trump's border tsar.Homan announced he would shut down the consultancy and recuse himself from discussions about border contracts to avoid the appearance of impropriety.This armoured vehicle was used in Iraq - now it's stationed at the US-Mexico border'Trump was right' - John Kerry says Democrats allowed migrant 'siege' of US borderTrump wants US-Mexico border wall to be painted black to stop climbersDonald Trump's border wallUS immigrationDonald TrumpUnited StatesRelatedDeported gang members get second chance at call centreSteve Bannon pleads guilty in border wall case and avoids jail timeFrom snowy cities to Mexican border - Trump deportations loomMore from the BBC1 hr agoTrump designates Antifa a 'domestic terrorist organisation'Trump signed an executive order as part of his crackdown on the "radical left" after the assassination of Charlie Kirk.1 hr ago2 hrs agoWhat is Antifa and why is President Trump targeting it?President Trump has signed an executive order designating Antifa as a domestic terror group, but legal experts have questioned how this will work. 2 hrs ago2 hrs agoUS Supreme Court to revisit laws curtailing Trump's power to fire top officialsThe ruling allows the president to remove the sole Democratic official on the Federal Trade Commission, an independent body set up by Congress.2 hrs ago3 hrs agoTrump urges pregnant women to avoid Tylenol over unproven autism linkSome studies have suggested an association between the two, but experts say there is no causal relationship. 3 hrs ago6 hrs agoTop stars call Jimmy Kimmel suspension 'dark moment' for free speechJennifer Aniston, Meryl Streep and Robert DeNiro are among more than 400 celebrities who signed a letter defending the comedian.6 hrs agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
