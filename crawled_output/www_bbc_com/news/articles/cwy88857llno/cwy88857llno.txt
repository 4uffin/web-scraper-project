It added disruption would continue into Monday "because Collins Aerospace is not yet able to deliver a new secure version of the check-in system".Heathrow said on Sunday that efforts to resolve the issue were ongoing. It declined to say whether or not the issue was a cyber attack.It apologised to those who had faced delays but stressed "the vast majority of flights have continued to operate", urging passengers to check their flight status before travelling to the airport and arrive in good time.The BBC understands around half airlines flying from Heathrow were back online in some form by Sunday - including British Airways which has been using a back-up system since Saturday.A Berlin Airport spokesperson told the BBC some airlines were still boarding passengers manually and it had no indication on how long the electronic outage would last.What are my rights if my flight is cancelled or delayed?How pen and paper comes to the rescue in an IT crisisThere have already been more cancellations across Heathrow, Berlin and Brussels so far on Sunday than throughout Saturday, according to flight data firm Cirium, though not all of these are due to the cyber-attack.There were hours-long queues on Saturday and some 47% of Heathrow's departing flights were delayed, according to flight tracker FlightAware. Additional staff were at hand in check-in areas to help minimise disruption.By Sunday afternoon, FlightAware data showed the number of delayed flights from Heathrow had fallen from levels seen on Saturday.Virgin Atlantic, which operates from Heathrow, said it was "aware of a technical issue impacting check-in systems at a number of airports including London Heathrow which may result in some delays to departures".It added that "currently all Virgin Atlantic flights are scheduled to depart as planned".Naomi RowanNaomi and her dog Dusty are staying in a hotel after being unable to fly on SaturdayNaomi Rowan, from Sudbury in Suffolk, was supposed to be moving to Costa Rica with her dog Dusty, but both are now in a hotel after their Air France flight from Heathrow on Saturday was affected by the cyber attack.She said staff were boarding passengers with pen and paper due to the outage but told her they were unable to board Dusty without the electronic system."I had a cry, booked a hotel and managed to get through to Air France on WhatsApp, who say the next available flight for me is Monday," she said.ReutersTravellers at Heathrow report multi-hour delays and long queues at check-inEurope's combined aviation safety organisation, Eurocontrol, said airline operators had been asked to cancel half their flight schedules to and from the airport until 02:00 on Monday due to the disruption.Meanwhile, Dublin Airport said that while the technical issues persisted and some airlines were continuing to check in manually, it was expecting to operate a full schedule on Sunday.A spokesperson told the BBC: "Passengers are advised to contact their airline directly for updates on their flight."Dublin Airport previously said that Cork Airport, which is owned by the same parent company, had experienced a "minor impact" from the cyber-attack - but Cork Airport has since said it has faced no disruption with all services operating as normal.Berlin Brandenburg Airport is asking travellers to use online or self-service check-in instead of the desks while the outage is ongoing.It said there had been 12 cancellations in and out of the airport on Saturday, but that delays were generally less than 45 minutes.ReutersLong queues and large crowds could be seen at Brussels Airport on Saturday morningA National Cyber Security Centre spokesperson said on Saturday that it was working with Collins Aerospace, affected UK airports, the Department for Transport and law enforcement to fully understand the impact of the incident.The European Commission, which plays a role in managing airspace across Europe, said it was "closely monitoring the cyber-attack", but that there was no indication it had been "widespread or severe".Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander also said she was aware of the incident and was "getting regular updates and monitoring the situation".It was only last July that a global IT crash due to a faulty software update from cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike caused disruption to aviation, grounding flights across the US.Analysts said at the time that the incident highlighted how the industry could be vulnerable to issues with digital systems.Additional reporting by Rozina SiniDay of delays at Heathrow after cyber-attack brings disruptionTravelLondon Heathrow AirportTransportCyber-attacksInfrastructureAir travelRelatedGatwick second runway plan approved by transport secretaryWhat are my rights if my flight is cancelled or delayed?Day of delays at Heathrow after cyber-attack brings disruptionMore from the BBC8 hrs agoDublin Airport disruption continues following cyber-attackSome airlines in Terminal 2 are still having issues with their check-in and boarding systems.8 hrs ago14 hrs agoYoung people offered cyber crime safety coursePolice say the session is aimed at students who want a career in the cyber industry.14 hrs ago2 days agoBus workers to be balloted on strike actionThe dispute is over pay in a union campaign for workers to move closer to £15 an hour.
