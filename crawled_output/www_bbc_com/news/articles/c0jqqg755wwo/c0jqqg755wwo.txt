Thirty people were arrested and two officers injured as large groups of people clashed with police, with some throwing rocks and bottles. Around 1,500 people blocked a highway crossing the city, while a police car was set on fire, the Netherlands news agency ANP reported, citing police figures. Prime Minister Dick Schoof condemned the "shocking and bizarre images of shameless violence", saying it was "completely unacceptable". Right-wing leader Geert Wilders, who won the previous election in the Netherlands and has retained his lead in opinion polls ahead of a 29 October vote, was invited to speak at the demonstration but did not attend.Instead he also condemned the violence against police as "utterly unacceptable", saying it was the work of "idiots". The protest was organised by a right-wing activist, demanding stricter migration policies and a clampdown on asylum seekers.Violence erupted when large groups of protesters, many waving Dutch flags and flags associated with far-right groups, confronted security forces. EPAProtesters also smashed the windows of the headquarters of the centre-left D66 party, viewed by many on the far right as a party that serves a progressive elite.D66 leader Rob Jetten said the damage inside was extensive and told the protesters to "stay away from political parties"."If you think you can intimidate us, tough luck. We will never let extremist rioters take away our beautiful country," he said on social media platform X.Nobody was present in the D66 offices at the time of the protests, according to party officials cited by ANP.The Dutch government collapsed in June after Wilders withdrew his far-right PVV party from the governing coalition following a row over migration. The dispute came after Wilders pushed for 10 additional asylum measures, including a freeze on applications, halting the construction of reception centres and limiting family reunification.The governing coalition was in place for less than one year.More on this storyDutch government collapses after far-right leader quits coalitionGeert Wilders: Who is he and what does he want?ImmigrationThe HagueNetherlandsRelatedHundreds gather as immigration protest takes placeCafe owner angry at immigration raidScotland becoming less tolerant to immigration - Humza YousafMore from the BBC6 days agoMan copies 'peeing bear' for friend with cancerA cyclist dresses up as a bear and "urinates" into a canal to highlight awareness of prostate cancer.6 days ago12 Sep 2025Schools shut in two Dutch towns over youth violence and abuse videosAll five secondary schools in Beverwijk and Heemskerk are closed in a bid to restore calm.12 Sep 202528 Aug 2025Netherlands in Bangladesh 2025Results and scorecards from the Netherlands' brief tour of Bangladesh, featuring three Twenty20 internationals in Sylhet.28 Aug 202527 Aug 2025Painting looted by Nazis has vanished again, say Argentine policeProsecutor says painting no longer at Buenos Aires home featured in estate agent's advert.27 Aug 202526 Aug 2025Artwork looted by Nazis 80 years ago spotted in estate agent adPortrait of a Lady seen in house near Buenos Aires, more than 80 years after it was looted from a Jewish art dealer in Amsterdam.26 Aug 2025British Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
