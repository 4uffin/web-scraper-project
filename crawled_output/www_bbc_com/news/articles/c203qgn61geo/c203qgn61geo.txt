A bolt-action rifle was recovered near the shooting,
and a screwdriver was found on the roof from where the fatal shot was fired."I can report today that the DNA hits from the towel that was wrapped around the firearm and the DNA on the screwdriver are positively processed for the suspect in custody," Kash Patel told Fox and Friends.A formal charge is expected this week. A motive has yet to be determined.Watch: Charlie Kirk remembered at Kennedy Center vigilThe FBI director - who is expected to face questions at a hearing in Congress on Tuesday - also mentioned a note that was discovered at the suspect's home, which vowed to "take out" Kirk.According to Patel, it said: "'I have the opportunity to take out Charlie Kirk, and I'm going to take it.'"Even though it had been destroyed, they had forensic evidence of the note, he added.Investigators are also looking at social media accounts used by Mr Robinson, according to the BBC's US news partner CBS, and any signs that anyone may have known about or encouraged the shooting beforehand.
According to a Utah County Sheriff inmate booking sheet obtained by the BBC, Mr Robinson is accused of aggravated murder, obstruction of justice, and felony discharge of a firearm.The breakthrough comes after Utah Governor Spencer Cox said on Sunday that Mr Robinson - who had been persuaded to surrender by his father - had been refusing to co-operate with investigators and had not confessed to carrying out the shooting.Cox added that Mr Robinson's roommate and partner had been helping with the investigation. Watch: JD Vance hosts Charlie Kirk’s daily talk radio showVice-President JD Vance on Monday hosted a tribute episode of Kirk's daily podcast from the White House, speaking with conservative personalities and Trump administration aides to remember the 31-year-old - a long-time ally of the president. "One of Charlie's gifts was not talking at you, but engaging you where you were," White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles told Vance. The vice-president, a close friend of Kirk's, also spoke directly to the audience, slamming criticism of Kirk following his death."I'm desperate for our country to be united in condemnation of the actions and the ideas that killed my friend," Vance said, but "there is no unity with the people who celebrate Charlie Kirk's assassination, and there is no unity with the people... who pay the salaries of these terrorist sympathisers".Vance said the administration would "work to dismantle the institutions that promote violence and terrorism in our own country", echoing earlier podcast remarks from White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller."The last message that Charlie sent me was... that we need to have an organised strategy to go after the left-wing organisations that are promoting violence in this country", Miller told Vance.He said the government will "uproot and dismantle these terrorist networks" that Miller claimed "led to this assassination". Kirk grew to national prominence as co-founder of Turning Point USA, a conservative youth group.The father-of-two had been hosting the American Comeback Tour, visiting several college campuses across the US to debate college students, when he was shot.Manhunt intensifies for suspect who killed Charlie Kirk A rooftop figure, gunfire, then panic - how Charlie Kirk shooting unfoldedUnited StatesRelatedSecret Service disrupts telecom threat near UN General AssemblyEswatini says it has repatriated US deportee to JamaicaWhy US naval 'victory' off British coast is celebrated 246 years onBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
