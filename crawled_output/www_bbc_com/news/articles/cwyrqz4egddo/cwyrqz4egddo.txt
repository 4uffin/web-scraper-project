Malawians have been eagerly awaiting results, but the commission has not yet released any - despite the fact that nearly all votes have been counted. The commission is expected to announce the outcome only after all votes have been tallied and verified in order to avoid the possibility of the final result being challenged. A candidate needs to win more than 50% of the vote, or a run-off is held.
The 2019 election was marred by controversy when the highest court annulled then-President Mutharika's victory, citing widespread irregularities. Chakwera, 70, won the re-run by a wide margin, propelling him to the presidency. Mutharika, 85, is hoping to regain office in what would be a dramatic political comeback.Malawians also voted in parliamentary and local elections following a campaign dominated by the worsening economic crisis that has seen a severe shortage of fuel and foreign currency. The official inflation rate is close to 30%, with a frozen chicken in a supermarket in the capital, Lilongwe, costing about $20 (£15), in a nation where most people live on $2 a day or less.More about Malawi from the BBC:What is at stake in Malawi's elections as cost-of-living bites?'I tell my children not to play so we save money on soap'How brave judges rejected a 'second-rate election'Getty Images/BBCGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.Follow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafricaBBC Africa podcastsFocus on AfricaThis Is AfricaMalawiAfricaRelatedMalawi's ex-president wins election in comeback at age 85The professor who beat fraud allegations to become Malawi's president…againMalawi ex-president takes clear lead in vote-count, results showMore from the BBC2 hrs agoWhy a tiny island's fate could decide Seychelles' next presidentIndia, Qatari royals, China and ecologists have their own, very different, views on Assumption Island's future.2 hrs ago14 hrs agoFrench navy seizes nearly 10 tonnes of cocaine off West African coastFrench authorities say the "remarkable seizure" was found on board a fishing boat following a tip-off.14 hrs ago1 day agoSomalia's president: They tried to kill me five timesSomalia's President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud says he is a prime target of the Islamist group al-Shabab. 1 day ago1 day agoWhy Kordofan is key in Sudan's civil warThe battle for Kordofan, with a population of eight million, is the latest frontline in Sudan's civil war.1 day ago2 days agoLandmark deal paves way for cheaper HIV protection jabThe drug - a twice-yearly injection – reduces the current HIV treatment cost in developing countries. 2 days agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseSubscription TermsAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
