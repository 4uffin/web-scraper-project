Malawians have been eagerly awaiting results, but the commission has not yet released any - despite the fact that nearly all votes have been counted. The commission is expected to announce the outcome only after all votes have been tallied and verified in order to avoid the possibility of the final result being challenged. A candidate needs to win more than 50% of the vote, or a run-off is held.
The 2019 election was marred by controversy when the highest court annulled then-President Mutharika's victory, citing widespread irregularities. Chakwera, 70, won the re-run by a wide margin, propelling him to the presidency. Mutharika, 85, is hoping to regain office in what would be a dramatic political comeback.Malawians also voted in parliamentary and local elections following a campaign dominated by the worsening economic crisis that has seen a severe shortage of fuel and foreign currency. The official inflation rate is close to 30%, with a frozen chicken in a supermarket in the capital, Lilongwe, costing about $20 (£15), in a nation where most people live on $2 a day or less.More about Malawi from the BBC:What is at stake in Malawi's elections as cost-of-living bites?'I tell my children not to play so we save money on soap'How brave judges rejected a 'second-rate election'Getty Images/BBCGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.Follow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafricaBBC Africa podcastsFocus on AfricaThis Is AfricaMalawiAfricaRelatedMalawians await presidential poll result in vote dominated by economic woesWhat is at stake in Malawi's elections as cost-of-living bites?Malawi - where the petrol queue might overshadow the queue to voteMore from the BBC2 hrs ago'I'm Kenyan, don't shoot' - the athlete who says he was duped into the Russian armyEvans Kibet, now being held in Ukraine after surrendering, says he did not know he was signing up.2 hrs ago11 hrs agoDrone strike on Sudan mosque kills 78, medic tells BBCLocal activists and residents describe the early morning attack on worshippers.11 hrs ago13 hrs agoSouth African hospital worker arrested with human placentasThe maternity cleaner was allegedly seeking potential buyers for the body tissue when she was picked up.13 hrs ago18 hrs agoThe lonely life and death of Delhi's only African elephantFor 24 years, Shankar endured a lonely existence - including at least 13 spent in solitary confinement.18 hrs ago19 hrs agoFans, food and fast feet: Africa's top shotsA selection of the week's best photos from across the African continent and beyond.19 hrs agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
