Kimmel's broadcast was, however, available on streaming service Hulu + Live TV, which is owned by ABC's parent company Disney.Trump, who had welcomed the comedian's suspension, was critical of the reinstatement, writing: "I can't believe ABC Fake News gave Jimmy Kimmel his job back."Jimmy Kimmel Live! had been pulled after its host's statements about the shooting of Kirk caused uproar earlier this month. In a monologue at the time, the comedian said Trump and his allies were "desperately trying to characterise this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them" and trying to "score political points from it".He also likened Trump's reaction to Kirk's death to "how a four-year-old mourns a goldfish".Kirk was shot and killed while speaking at a university event in Utah on 10 September. Tyler Robinson, 22, has been charged with murder.Speaking on Tuesday's programme, Kimmel insisted he had not wanted to blame any specific group for Kirk's murder. "But I understand that to some that felt either ill-timed or unclear or maybe both," he said. "And for those who think I did point a finger, I get why you're upset."Kimmel praised Erika Kirk for forgiving her husband's alleged killer during a memorial service that was held at the weekend. "It was a selfless act of grace... that touched me deeply," he said.The comic criticised Trump for calling for the axing of his fellow late-night hosts – all of whom are frequent critics of the president as they riff on the day's biggest news stories. "Our leader celebrates people losing their livelihoods because he can't take a joke," Kimmel said, adding that Trump openly rooting for people to lose their jobs was "un-American" and "dangerous".Kimmel was also critical of Brendan Carr, the head of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which regulates US television. Carr was one of the first to call for Kimmel's suspension.Kimmel alleged that Carr was once a free speech advocate, but flipped after Kimmel's controversial broadcast. He was joined by Hollywood legend and Trump critic Robert De Niro, who appeared in a skit portraying Carr. Kimmel said the FCC was "using mob tactics to suppress free speech". De Niro quipped: "Speech, it ain't free no more."Kimmel pulls no punches as he ramps up battle with TrumpDisney reinstates Jimmy KimmelUS TV hosts back KimmelTrump says TV networks opposed to him should 'maybe' lose licenceRos Atkins on… What Kimmel's suspension means for free speechThe comedian's comeback was praised by celebrity supporters, including actor Ben Stiller, who lauded the "brilliant monologue". But it was not universally applauded. Turning Point USA spokesman Andrew Kolvet, Charlie Kirk's former producer, said Kimmel should have offered a full apology for suggesting the suspected killer was a Maga supporter. "Not good enough," he wrote on X.About an hour before showtime, Trump wrote on his social media platform that he could not believe that ABC had reinstated the comedian, saying the White House had been told the show was cancelled."Something happened between then and now because his audience is GONE, and his 'talent' was never there," Trump wrote.Trump also threatened to "test ABC out on this", without giving further details.Ahead of the broadcast, dozens of local TV stations in the US run by affiliates Nexstar and Sinclair said they would continue to replace Kimmel's show with alternative programming.The two companies together control more than 20% of ABC's affiliated television stations, according to the New York Times.Nexstar said the situation would continue, "pending assurance that all parties are committed to fostering an environment of respectful, constructive dialogue in the markets we serve".The media company is currently trying to close a $6.2bn (£4.86bn) deal to acquire its rival Tegna that needs FCC approval.The FCC regulates radio, TV and satellite airwaves, giving it power over a range of matters, including mergers and decency complaints.Carr himself praised the two firms' on Tuesday. "We need to keep empowering local TV stations to serve their communities of license," said Carr, a Trump appointee, who last week threatened action against Disney and ABC.Carr earlier said Kimmel's offending broadcast was "appearing to directly mislead the American public" with his comments about Kirk's killer.His remarks, coupled with concerns from local broadcasters that run ABC affiliates, prompted the network to "indefinitely" suspend Kimmel's show. The show's suspension prompted strong backlash from lawmakers, labour unions, and free speech proponents. Celebrity campaigns and boycotts targeted Disney, ABC's parent company. Kimmel was backed by his colleagues in late-night TV, including CBS host Stephen Colbert - whose show will end in May - Jon Stewart and Seth Meyers.He also received support from Republican US Senator Ted Cruz, who accused Carr of acting like "a mafioso" - comments that inspired Kimmel's skit with De Niro.Popular podcaster Joe Rogan later echoed Cruz, saying: "I definitely don't think that the government should be involved ever in dictating what a comedian can or cannot say in a monologue."Disney ultimately said it would bring back the show after "having thoughtful conversations with Jimmy".Top stars call Jimmy Kimmel suspension 'dark moment' for free speechJimmy Kimmel show to return after suspension over Charlie Kirk commentsWhat does the FCC do - and can it revoke a TV network's licence?TV stations refuse to air 'insensitive' Kimmel's show after ABC lifts suspensionMediaTelevisionUnited StatesRelatedSTV to cut 60 jobs and axe north news programme Jimmy Kimmel's return draws record ratings despite limited showingKimmel pulls no punches as he sends defiant message to TrumpMore from the BBC16 mins agoFormer FBI director James Comey indicted on two chargesJames Comey says he is innocent after being accused of lying to Congress in 2020 while testifying about leaks to the media.16 mins ago3 hrs agoUS President Gerald Ford's would-be assassin dies at age 95Sara Jane Moore fired two shots at the Republican president during his visit to San Francisco in 1975.
