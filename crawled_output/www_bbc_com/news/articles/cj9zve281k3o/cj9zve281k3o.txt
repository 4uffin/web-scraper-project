Some protesters carried signs with slogans written across them including "no to racism", "no to Trump" and "stop arming Israel". Others carried smaller versions of the 20ft Trump Baby blimp that floated through crowds during protests against the president's first state visit in 2019.The Metropolitan Police estimated that up to 5,000 people were in attendance.More than 1,600 police officers had been deployed including 500 from other forces, the force said. Earlier on Wednesday, the Met Police's Deputy Assistant Commissioner, Louise Puddefoot, said it would be "another busy day" for officers. This protest came just days after the Unite the Kingdom protest.She added that police had been in "close contact" with the organisers and had asked all taking part to be "considerate to the local community" and keep disruption to a minimum.The Stop Trump Coalition includes groups ranging from climate campaigners to anti-racism groups and pro-Palestine organisations.LIVE: Follow the latest from Trump's state visit to UKWhat is the president doing during his visit?In pictures: Trump and Melania meet the royalsAmerica's unofficial party house where presidents stay in LondonMelania’s big hat, Kate’s feather brooch and other standout looksSecurity measures - from anti-drones and decoys to bringing in The BeastAhead of the march, a spokesperson for the coalition said: "A government that will bow down to Trump and to racism is one that will open the door to fascism."Although Trump was not visiting Parliament, the protest groups said they would demonstrate to "defeat the politics of Trumpism" and to promote "an alternative, democratic vision of the world based on peace, social justice and international cooperation".In the midst of the crowds - which started gathering near BBC Broadcasting House - people told the BBC why they were there, racking up a long list of grievances against the US president. They said they found him "despicable" and wanted to send a message that he was not welcome.Reverend Poppy Hughes, who was asked about those who said vicars should be apolitical, replied: "Jesus preached peace and compassion and that's why I'm here".Reverend Poppy Hughes came because of the teachings of JesusZoe Gardner, a political commentator and one of the organisers of Wednesday's protest, said that Trump "represents everything that we hate"."We want our government to show some backbone, and have a little bit of pride and represent that huge feeling of disgust at Donald Trump's politics in the UK," she added. Climate campaigner Auriel Dowty Glanville from Wimbledon said she was demonstrating because she believed the president was a "climate denier" and climate change was "the biggest threat facing us on Earth".She called the second state visit invite "appalling", adding: "It's all about the trade deal."Auriel Dowty Glanville has dressed up with her take on the Statue of Liberty for the protestSarah Montgomery and Claudio Solano, from North London, arrived in white protective face masks that read "Trump stinks".They said they had had the masks since Trump's first state visit."He still stinks," Ms Montgomery said. "Everything he stands for stinks."Mr Solano, from Brazil, said he disagreed with both Trump's policies and his support for Brazil's former right-wing leader Jair Bolsonaro."It is disgusting, and I don't understand why Britain has to be so cowardly," he added. As the crowd moved, it paused outside Downing Street, which was being protected by officers from Wales and Northern Ireland. Some of the demonstrators carried signs including "Duck Off Donald" and "Feed him to the Corgis".At Parliament Square - where the march stopped - a number of people took to a stage. There was a performance from singer Billy Bragg.Other speakers included former Labour MPs Jeremy Corbyn and Zarah Sultana, comedian Nish Kumar, and Green Party leader Zack Polanski.A small crowd of protesters also gathered in Windsor on Wednesday afternoon, where Trump is spending the day with the Royal Family ahead of the state banquet.Amy Tisi told the BBC she protested the last time Trump visited and it was "important to make a stand". She said she questioned if the "size and scale" of the trip was meant to fuel his ego.But one Trump supporter, wearing a Davy Crockett hat, called him "the greatest president". His remark was met with a chorus of boos from parts of the crowd.Earlier on Wednesday, a van decorated with a photograph of the president and late convicted paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein was driven through Berkshire.A Thames Valley Police spokesperson said the driver had left after a conversation with the police, adding: "No arrests were made and no vehicles were seized."Referring to this incident during his speech in London, Corbyn called it "sinister" that the van was stopped by police, preventing people from "expressing a point of view"."They take away the right to protest because they don't want us to protest," he added.Four men were arrested after images of Trump and Epstein were projected on to Windsor Castle on Tuesday as the president arrived in the UK.Additional reporting by Alex Smith in Windsor LondonDonald TrumpWindsor CastleRelated'I wanted to end my life, now I've won an award for helping others'Just Stop Oil duo guilty of damaging Tesla robotFour arrests in Kyrone Moodie murder investigationMore from the BBC13 mins agoColombia's president calls US attacks on alleged drug boats 'act of tyranny'Trump has said the airstrikes, which have reportedly killed 17, targeted drug-smuggling boats primarily from Venezuela.13 mins ago36 mins ago'There's no way we can afford $100,000': Small firms scramble over H-1B visa feesStartups and smaller firms could bear the brunt of Trump's new H-1B visa fee, and some fear it could thwart US innovation.36 mins ago4 hrs agoWatch: White House replaces President Biden portrait with image of an autopenPresident Donald Trump has previously claimed Biden used an autopen to sign important documents, including pardons.4 hrs ago4 hrs agoLuigi Mangione's lawyers claim Trump violated right to fair trial They say the US president's comments were "part of a greater political narrative that has no place in any criminal case".4 hrs ago7 hrs agoHow doctors are responding to Trump's autism announcement Physicians worry pregnant women may forgo a treatment over an unproven link between Tylenol and autism. 7 hrs agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
