"The data and privacy will be led by one of America's greatest tech companies, Oracle, and the algorithm will also be controlled by America as well," she told Fox News."So all of those details have already been agreed upon. Now we just need this deal to be signed."Mr Ellison's son, David Ellison, recently acquired media company Paramount, which owns CBS News, making the Ellisons one of the country's most powerful families in media. Trump said on Friday that he and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping approved a deal on the future of TikTok's US operations during a phone call, although there was no confirmation from Beijing.Trump wrote on Truth Social that the call was "productive" and he "appreciated" Xi's approval of deal, which would reportedly see TikTok's US business sold to a group of US investors.On Saturday, China's Commerce Ministry issued a statement that was less clear on the prospect of a deal: "China's position on TikTok is clear: The Chinese government respects the wishes of the enterprise, and welcomes it to carry out commercial negotiations in accordance with market rules to reach a solution compliant with China's laws and regulations, and strikes a balance of interests."China's official state news agency Xinhua left the outcome of their discussion less clear, with Xi quoted as saying that Beijing "welcomes negotiations over TikTok".A sticking point in negotiations appears to have been over who will own the powerful algorithm that pushes content to TikTok's 170 million American users.Speaking alongside British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer in the UK on Thursday, Trump sidestepped a question from a reporter about whether an American buyer would need to build a new algorithm, or if they could continue to use the current algorithm.While Trump initially called for TikTok to be banned during his first term, he has changed course. He turned to the hugely popular platform to boost his support among young Americans during his successful 2024 presidential campaign.In January, the US Supreme Court upheld a law first passed in early 2024, banning the app unless ByteDance divested from its US operations. The app went "dark" only briefly at the time, before the ban was delayed.The US Department of Justice previously expressed concerns that TikTok's access to the data of US users posed a national security threat of "immense depth and scale".Social mediaTikTokRelatedTrump says a TikTok deal is done.
