It is core to our country's values."But we will not stand for assaults on police officers doing their job or for people feeling intimidated on our streets because of their background or the colour of their skin."Britain is a nation proudly built on tolerance, diversity and respect. Our flag represents our diverse country and we will never surrender it to those that use it as a symbol of violence, fear and division."Police say 26 officers were injured on the day - including four who were seriously hurt - with 24 people arrested. For most of Saturday afternoon, central London was filled with thousands of people waving mainly union jacks, as well as St George's flags. Some Scottish Saltires and Welsh flags were also seen.ReutersAbout 150,000 people descended on central London for the march organised by RobinsonKyle told Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg that protests like these were "klaxon calls" for those in power to redouble their efforts to address the major concerns people have, including on immigration."What worries me most is the divisions in our society and other societies and other democratic societies... it's not even the left and the right at the moment," he said."There are figures such as Tommy Robinson that are able to touch into a sense of disquiet and grievance in the community in our society."The "small minority" who had committed violence would be held accountable, he told the programme.Tech billionaire Elon Musk spoke to protesters on Whitehall via videolink, telling them they could either "fight back" or "die". He also referred to massive uncontrolled migration and called for a change of government in the UK.Kyle criticised some of Musk's comments as "totally inappropriate".Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, addressed crowds directly at the march, where he criticised politicians for "parroting" his ideas.Who is Tommy Robinson?Dozens of officers injured as up to 150,000 join rallyWhy have England flags gone up in cities and towns?A huge policing operation was put in place for the protests this weekend, with about 1,000 Met officers deployed and an extra 500 from other forces including Leicestershire, Nottinghamshire and Devon and Cornwall drafted in.Assistant Commissioner Matt Twist said: "There is no doubt that many came to exercise their lawful right to protest, but there were many who came intent on violence."The protest was largely peaceful come Saturday lunchtime, but tensions flared as the afternoon progressed.The Met said some officers had been attacked while trying to keep the two groups apart and dozens of officers were injured, including four who were seriously hurt.The number of protesters joining the march, organised by Robinson, became too large to fit into Whitehall, police said, and confrontation took place when officers tried to stop them encircling counter-protesters.Mounted police officers used batons to push back crowds and officers were kicked and punched, the Met said.Three of the 24 people arrested were women and the rest were men, while the youngest and oldest people detained at the protest were aged 19 and 58, respectively, the force said on Sunday.Several people were arrested for more than one offence.The force added that officers were working to identify other people involved in disorder with a view to making further arrests.Keir StarmerMetropolitan Police ServiceRelatedChris Mason: Delight and relief in government after state visitTrump suggests Starmer could use military to control UK bordersSarah Smith: Trump visit showed UK's warm relations - and limited influenceMore from the BBC7 hrs agoGross misconduct not proven for Met PC over TaserA Met Police officer who left a man paralysed when he fell after being Tasered has 7 hrs ago8 hrs agoRapist may have hundreds of victims, Met saysA man convicted for rape may have had hundreds of other victims, police warn.8 hrs ago2 days agoMet Police staff to vote on strike in pay disputeAbout 6,500 civilian staff could strike as union bosses accuse the Met of pay "inequality".2 days ago2 days agoMet using 'Al Capone approach' to root out misconduct in forceThe London force says it has removed more than 1,400 officers and staff from its ranks in three years.2 days ago3 days agoMadeleine McCann suspect freed from German prisonChristian Brückner has never been charged with any crime in relation to the McCann case.3 days agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
