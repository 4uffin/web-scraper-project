Super Typhoon Ragasa is the strongest storm of 2025 and is now bearing down on China's southern coast. It is due to make landfall in Guangdong province on Wednesday, where some 370,000 people have been evacuated, and many schools and businesses shut. Hong Kong has upgraded its typhoon warning to level 10, the maximum level.Ragasa - equivalent to a Category 5 hurricane - packed wind gusts of up to 285km/h (177mph) at its highest point on Monday, and has triggered warnings of floods, storm surges and landslides across the region this week.Taiwan has been lashed by the outside edge of Ragasa since Monday. The island recorded almost 60cm (24 inches) of rain in its east due to the typhoon, Reuters news agency reported.In Hualien county the burst lake washed away a bridge, uprooted trees and submerged cars. Video showed fast-moving water flowing through the area."In some places, water temporarily rose as high as the second floor of a house and was about [as high as] one floor in the town centre, where the water has been receding," Lee Lung-sheng, deputy chief of Hualien County Fire Department, told
AFP news agency."About 263 people were trapped and moved up to higher ground when the river suddenly rose. They are not in immediate danger, but they are very worried about the high water." Elsewhere in Taiwan six people were injured, ferry services suspended and more than 100 international flights cancelled as Ragasa passed through. Getty ImagesChina's meteorological agency has issued strong warnings about Super Typhoon Ragasa, dubbing it the "King of Storms"Chinese authorities are warning of storm surges of up to five metres. Some 370,000 people have been evacuated so far in Guangdong, as authorities warn of a "catastrophic" situation.On Tuesday, supermarket shelves in Hong Kong were wiped empty of fresh bread, vegetables, meat and instant noodles as residents prepared to hunker down. Hong Kong International Airport said it expected "significant disruption to flight operations" from 18:00 local time (10:00 GMT) on Tuesday until the next day. More than 500 Cathay Pacific flights are expected to be cancelled, while Hong Kong Airlines said it would stop all departures from the city.Ragasa has been dubbed the "King of Storms" by China's meteorological agency and is expected to move towards northern Vietnam in the coming days, potentially affecting millions.In cities across southern China, shop owners piled sandbags in front of their stores in preparation for the storm's arrival, with residents in low-lying areas next to the sea front particularly worried about tidal surges.Many have also taped up the windows of their homes and businesses, hoping to prevent their destruction.'Dirty side' of Ragasa menaces Hong KongGetty ImagesFresh food has sold out as Hong Kong residents prepare to for the stormAlthough this part of southern China and Hong Kong is used to frequent typhoons, the impact this time may be worsened because of the location of the storm.The right hand side of Ragasa - as it approaches Hong Kong and Guangdong - is know as the "dirty side" - and it is this which will hit the region. The "dirty side" can be much more destructive than the left-hand side, primarily because the motion of the storm is added to the background circulation of the typhoon. Where these two movements combine is where the most destructive winds are found. Additionally, these winds will be pushing water inland, resulting in a bigger storm surge.It is not yet clear exactly how much climate change has affected Ragasa specifically. But a warming world is expected to make tropical storms like typhoons and hurricanes more intense on average, according to UN scientists.That means higher wind speeds, heavier rainfall and a higher risk of coastal flooding, although the number of typhoons across east and southeast Asia may decrease in future.Getty ImagesMore than 10,000 people were evacuated in the Philippines Ragasa also lashed through a remote island in the north of the Philippines on Monday, killing at least one person as thousands of families were evacuated before the storm made landfall. Schools and government offices were shut in large parts of the country, including in the capital Manila.Ragasa would "pose a serious threat" to Hong Kong, said Eric Chan, the city's Chief Secretary for Administration, comparing it to two other typhoons which left behind trails of severe destruction.Super typhoon Mangkhut in 2018 - to date the most intense typhoon to strike the city - injured 200 people, sank ships and wrecked infrastructure, with the weather agency estimating economic losses of HK$4.6bn ($592m: £438m).In 2017, typhoon Hato unleashed serious flooding and injured more than 100 people in the city.With additional reporting by Kelly Ng in Singapore, Simon Fraser in London, Mark Poynting, climate reporter and BBC Weather's Sarah Keith-LucasTyphoon Ragasa tracks towards China and VietnamAsiaChinaPhilippinesSevere weatherRelatedOver 1,000 children fall ill from free school lunches in IndonesiaAustralian film altered in China to make gay couple straightIndia imposes curfew in Ladakh after statehood protests turn violentMore from the BBC7 hrs agoChina launches campaign to keep killjoys off the internetPessimistic social media posts may now be targets of a fresh crackdown by the Chinese government.7 hrs ago16 hrs agoFlood defence spending of £2m approvedThe council is boosting defences after disruption in recent years saw homes flooded and roads closed.16 hrs ago1 day agoAmerica's blame game over Canada's wildfire smoke misses the point, experts sayUS officials have blamed Canada for not doing enough to stop its wildfire smoke from wafting south.
