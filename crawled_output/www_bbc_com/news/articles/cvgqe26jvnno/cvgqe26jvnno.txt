Why do Channel migrants want to come to the UK?Record number of lone children on small boatsThe policy is part of a number of measures unveiled by the Labour government in an attempt to tackle the small boats crossings from France.In July, it announced that 25 people including gang leaders and small boat suppliers had had their assets frozen and been banned from travelling to the UK. An extra 300 National Crime Agency officers will target the people-smugglers arranging the crossings, and a new Border Security Command body will work closely with the Home office, police, immigration enforcement and intelligence agencies. The UK is also paying France almost £500m over three years - as agreed by the previous Conservative government - to fund extra officers on the French coast.Sign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to keep up with the inner workings of Westminster and beyond.FranceEnglish ChannelRelatedMacron calls Trump after motorcade blocks his carUK operators 'ready' for new border checks systemEuropean recognition of Palestinian state shows US still only power that countsMore from the BBC4 days agoMore than 1,000 people cross Channel in one dayThe number of people who have made the crossing in 2025 is 32,103, a record for this point in a year.4 days ago5 days agoMigrant returned to France after government wins court challengeEritrean man arrives in Paris under the "one in, one out" deal as at least three boats carrying migrants leave beaches in France. 5 days ago8 days agoEritrean man wins block on removal to France under 'one in, one out' dealSome migrants who arrived in the UK by small boat had been told they would be put on flights to France as early as Tuesday.8 days ago10 Sep 2025Children feared among three dead in Channel crossing attemptCalais authorities say the three who died were likely crushed to the bottom of the boat.10 Sep 202510 Sep 2025How many people cross the Channel in small boats?Sir Keir Starmer has promised to "smash the gangs" which smuggle people across the English Channel.10 Sep 2025British Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
