15 September 2025ShareSaveBenjamin RussellBBC ScotlandShareSaveAlamyOne contestant from 2023 takes part in the the stone skimming competition which has taken place on the island of Easdale for 42 yearsThe world stone skimming championships have been rocked by a cheating scandal, after several competitors were disqualified for tampering.More than 2,200 people, from 27 countries, attended this year's event on the tiny island of Easdale off the west coast of Scotland.Rules state that stones must come from naturally occurring island slate, however some were found to have been ground into a "suspiciously circular" shape to help them bounce on water.Organiser Dr Kyle Mathews told BBC News that the offenders had "held their hands up" and apologised.Entrants choose their own stones and judges use a measuring device, the "ring of truth", to ensure they are no bigger than three inches in diameter. Each competitor is allowed three skims and stones must bounce at least twice on water before sinking.

"The problem was we didn't just notice at the time that they were suspiciously circular."AFP via Getty ImagesThe rules state stones can only be picked from naturally occurring slateWorld Stone Skimming ChampionshipsJonathan Jennings was the overall winner of this year's eventDr Matthews said lessons had been learned and they would "move on to an even greater event next year".Entrant Jonathan Jennings went on to victory last week as the contest's first American winner, skimming his stones a cumulative distance of 177m.The event was first organised in 1983 by island resident Albert Baker and after a break was revived in 1997 by community group Eilean Eisdeal.The contest is staged in a former slate quarry that was flooded by a tidal wave in 1881.It is run by volunteers and the proceeds support local community projects and charities. Last year it raised £15,000.Easdale is the smallest permanently inhabited island of the Inner Hebrides with a population of about 60 people.Watch: Tips from 2023's competition on the perfect skimMore on this story...Stone skimmers gather for world championshipsRow over world stone-skimming isle's harbourBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseSubscription TermsAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
