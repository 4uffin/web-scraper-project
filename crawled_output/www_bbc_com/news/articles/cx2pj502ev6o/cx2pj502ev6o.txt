I'm excited," he said.Jeff Dowling/EMBL-EBILead researcher Prof Ewan Birney says the model's disease predictions stack upThe AI model was initially developed using anonymous UK data - including hospital admissions, GP records and lifestyle habits such as smoking - collected from more than 400,000 people as part of the UK Biobank research project.The model was then tested to see if its predictions stacked up using data from other Biobank participants, and then with 1.9 million people's medical records in Denmark."It's good, it's really good in Denmark," says Prof Birney."If our model says it's a one-in-10 risk for the next year, it really does seem like it turns out to be one in 10."The model is best at predicting diseases like type 2 diabetes, heart attacks and sepsis that have a clear disease progression, rather than more random events like infections. What can you do with the results?People are already offered a cholesterol-lowering statin based on a calculation of their risk of a heart attack or stroke.The AI tool is not ready for clinical use, but the plan is to use it in a similar way, to spot high-risk patients while there is an opportunity to intervene early and prevent disease. This could include medicines or specific lifestyle advice - such as people likely to develop some liver disorders benefitting from cutting back their alcohol intake more than the general population. The artificial intelligence could also help inform disease-screening programmes and
analyse all the healthcare records in an area to anticipate demand - such as how many heart attacks a year there will be in Norwich in 2030, to help plan resources."This is the beginning of a new way to understand human health and disease progression," said Prof Moritz Gerstung, head of the division of AI in oncology at DKFZ, the German Cancer Research Centre.He added: "Generative models such as ours could one day help personalise care and anticipate healthcare needs at scale."AI designs antibiotics for gonorrhoea and MRSA superbugsArtificial intelligence finds lung cancerThe AI model, described in the scientific journal Nature, needs refining and testing before it is used clinically. There are also potential biases as it was built from UK Biobank data which is drawn mostly from people aged 40 to 70, rather than the whole population. The model is now being upgraded to account for more medical data such as imaging, genetics and blood analysis.But Prof Birney says: "Just to stress, this is research – everything needs to be tested and well-regulated and thought about before it's used, but the technology is here to make these kinds of predictions."He anticipates it will follow a similar path to the use of genomics in healthcare where it took a decade to go from scientists being confident in the technology to healthcare being able to use it routinely. The study was a collaboration between the European Molecular Biology Laboratory, the German Cancer Research Centre (DKFZ) and the University of Copenhagen.Prof Gustavo Sudre, a neuroimaging and AI researcher at King's College London, commented: "This research looks to be a significant step towards scalable, interpretable, and – most importantly – ethically responsible form of predictive modelling in medicine."Medical researchHealthArtificial intelligenceTechnologyRelated'Revolutionary' tech could heal broken bonesHospital and university developing new cancer braThe trade in US body parts that's completely legal - but ripe for exploitationMore from the BBCJust nowDentistry shake-up could see healthy waiting two yearsNew proposals say Welsh patients with healthy teeth will have routine check-ups every 18 to 24 months.Just now29 mins agoDementia-friendly care village plans examinedThe £19m proposals for Tweedbank in the Borders are put on display after getting planning approval.29 mins ago32 mins agoNew pharmacy degree to help combat industry shortageThe Master of Pharmacy course will launch in September 2026 with up to 40 students. 32 mins ago2 hrs agoTrust doctors over Trump on paracetamol, Streeting saysHe tells expectant mothers to ignore Trump's claims of a link between use of the painkiller and autism.2 hrs ago3 hrs agoMan takes on Land's End to John O'Groats challengeDrew Jonkmans is running from Cornwall to Scotland and then cycling the same route back.3 hrs agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
