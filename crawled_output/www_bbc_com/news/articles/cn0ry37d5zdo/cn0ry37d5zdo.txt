Several others approached local authorities to make a pitch for councillors to endorse them.What does the president of Ireland do?The president of Ireland is the country's head of state.They represent the country abroad, take centre stage at major national events, and are responsible for ensuring that the constitution – the set of rules for government and politics - is followed.The president's powers are limited, but the office-holder's influence can be profound.For example, the election of Mary Robinson in 1990 – as the first woman to have the job – was seen as heralding a new era of social liberalisation.Mary McAleese held the office from 1997-2011, during pivotal years for the Northern Ireland peace process.Her emphasis on reconciliation culminated in a historic state visit to Ireland by Queen Elizabeth II.Presidents tend to be among the most prominent political figures in Ireland – with the privilege of addressing the nation at Christmas and on St Patrick's Day, and hosting dignitaries and citizens at their splendid official residence, Áras an Uachtaráin in Dublin's Phoenix Park.Republic of IrelandFine GaelFianna FáilRelatedThree candidates will contest Irish presidential electionIrish presidential candidate condemns Hamas and Israel Presidential candidate takes action over online 'smears' More from the BBC2 days agoTaoiseach criticises presidential candidate for 'justifying' HamasThe candidate says Hamas is "part of the fabric of the Palestinian people" and it is "not up to" Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer to decide.2 days ago9 Sep 2025All-Ireland winning GAA manager wins Fianna Fáil presidential nominationJim Gavin defeated MEP Billy Kelleher by 41 votes to 29 in the party's selection contest.9 Sep 20255 Sep 2025Ahern, Donnelly and Flatley drop out of Irish presidential electionBertie Ahern, Joanna Donnelly and Michael Flatley have all confirmed they have withdrawn from the race to be the next Irish president.5 Sep 20252 Sep 2025Former meteorologist aims to join Humphreys in October presidential pollHeather Humphreys will contest the Irish presidential election, as 24 October is reported to be polling day.2 Sep 20251 Sep 2025Ex-GAA boss Séan Kelly withdraws bid for Irish presidencySéan Kelly says after weeks of discussions, it is "clear" he does not have the support to get the Fine Gael nomination.1 Sep 2025British Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
