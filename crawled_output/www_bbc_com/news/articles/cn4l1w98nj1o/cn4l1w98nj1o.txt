It houses more than 170,000 artefacts, including Amenemope's gilded wooden funerary mask.The bracelet's disappearance comes six weeks before the opening of the Grand Egyptian Museum in nearby Giza, where the world renowned treasures of King Tutankhamun's tomb have been transferred and will go on display.Grand Egyptian Museum partially opens to publicTutankhamun's inspiring 21st Century afterlife'Eight accused' over King Tut's beardArchaeologyEgyptRelatedDig to unearth lost manor houses nears endFind could be 'incredibly rare' carving of a faceEgypt says 3,000-year-old bracelet was stolen and melted downMore from the BBC10 Sep 2025Marmoush to miss Manchester derby with knee injuryManchester City will be without forward Omar Marmoush for Sunday's Manchester derby after the Egyptian suffers a knee injury on international duty. 10 Sep 20257 Sep 2025Ethiopia outfoxes Egypt over the Nile's waters with its mighty damEthiopia is set to inaugurate a mega dam that has stoked tensions with Egypt.7 Sep 20256 Sep 2025One of the world's most sacred places is being turned into a luxury mega-resortThe biblical site of Mount Sinai in Egypt is at the heart of an unholy row over plans to build a huge new tourism project.6 Sep 20252 Sep 2025African battle for 2026 World Cup spots intensifiesWith four rounds of qualifying remaining, which African sides are most likely to reach the 2026 Fifa World Cup - and who could miss out on the finals?2 Sep 202531 Aug 2025UK shuts embassy building in Cairo amid row over activist's arrestThe removal of the barriers is widely seen as retaliation for the arrest of a pro-Egyptian government activist in London last week.31 Aug 2025British Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
