It houses more than 170,000 artefacts, including Amenemope's gilded wooden funerary mask.The bracelet's disappearance comes six weeks before the opening of the Grand Egyptian Museum in nearby Giza, where the world renowned treasures of King Tutankhamun's tomb have been transferred and will go on display.Grand Egyptian Museum partially opens to publicTutankhamun's inspiring 21st Century afterlife'Eight accused' over King Tut's beardArchaeologyEgyptRelatedReplica prehistoric roundhouse planned for GairlochPrecious hoard lay forgotten for almost 3,000 yearsRoman villa with 'swimming pool' marked out in parkMore from the BBC20 hrs agoPlea for help as donkeys suffer in Israel and GazaThe Haywards Heath charity is marking its 25th anniversary with a nationwide fundraising challenge.20 hrs ago1 day agoSomalia's president: They tried to kill me five timesSomalia's President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud says he is a prime target of the Islamist group al-Shabab. 1 day ago2 days agoBritish-Egyptian activist reunited with family after release from prison2 days ago2 days agoBritish-Egyptian activist reunited with family after release from prisonAlaa Abdel Fattah, who was imprisoned in Egypt for six years, is reunited with his family in Cairo after being pardoned.2 days ago3 days agoEgypt's president pardons British-Egyptian activist Alaa Abdel FattahThe British-Egyptian activist is one of six people whose sentences President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi commuted, according to state media.3 days agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseSubscription TermsAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
