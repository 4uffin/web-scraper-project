He then sold it for $4,025 to a gold foundry worker, who had melted it down with other jewellery, it added.The ministry said the four individuals confessed to their crimes after being arrested and that the money was seized.The ministry added that legal action would be taken against them.On Tuesday, Egypt's tourism and antiquities ministry announced that it had taken immediate measures after the bracelet disappeared from the Egyptian Museum's restoration laboratory, and that the case had been referred to police.An image of the gold band adorned with spherical lapis lazuli beads had been circulated to all Egyptian airports, seaports and land border crossings as a precaution to prevent it being smuggled out of the country, it said.Local media reported that the disappearance was detected in recent days as museum staff were preparing to ship dozens of artefacts to Rome for an exhibition.The Egyptian Museum in Cairo is the oldest archaeological museum in the Middle East. It houses more than 170,000 artefacts, including Amenemope's gilded wooden funerary mask.The bracelet's theft came weeks before the opening of the Grand Egyptian Museum in nearby Giza, where the famous treasures of King Tutankhamun's tomb have been transferred.Search for ancient Egyptian gold bracelet missing from Cairo museumGrand Egyptian Museum partially opens to publichttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-63742475ArchaeologyEgyptRelatedReplica prehistoric roundhouse planned for GairlochPrecious hoard lay forgotten for almost 3,000 yearsRoman villa with 'swimming pool' marked out in parkMore from the BBC24 hrs agoPlea for help as donkeys suffer in Israel and GazaThe Haywards Heath charity is marking its 25th anniversary with a nationwide fundraising challenge.24 hrs ago1 day agoSomalia's president: They tried to kill me five timesSomalia's President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud says he is a prime target of the Islamist group al-Shabab. 1 day ago2 days agoBritish-Egyptian activist reunited with family after release from prison2 days ago3 days agoBritish-Egyptian activist reunited with family after release from prisonAlaa Abdel Fattah, who was imprisoned in Egypt for six years, is reunited with his family in Cairo after being pardoned.3 days ago3 days agoEgypt's president pardons British-Egyptian activist Alaa Abdel FattahThe British-Egyptian activist is one of six people whose sentences President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi commuted, according to state media.3 days agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseSubscription TermsAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
