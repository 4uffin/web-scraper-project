He then sold it for $4,025 to a gold foundry worker, who had melted it down with other jewellery, it added.The ministry said the four individuals confessed to their crimes after being arrested and that the money was seized.The ministry added that legal action would be taken against them.On Tuesday, Egypt's tourism and antiquities ministry announced that it had taken immediate measures after the bracelet disappeared from the Egyptian Museum's restoration laboratory, and that the case had been referred to police.An image of the gold band adorned with spherical lapis lazuli beads had been circulated to all Egyptian airports, seaports and land border crossings as a precaution to prevent it being smuggled out of the country, it said.Local media reported that the disappearance was detected in recent days as museum staff were preparing to ship dozens of artefacts to Rome for an exhibition.The Egyptian Museum in Cairo is the oldest archaeological museum in the Middle East. It houses more than 170,000 artefacts, including Amenemope's gilded wooden funerary mask.The bracelet's theft came weeks before the opening of the Grand Egyptian Museum in nearby Giza, where the famous treasures of King Tutankhamun's tomb have been transferred.Search for ancient Egyptian gold bracelet missing from Cairo museumGrand Egyptian Museum partially opens to publichttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-63742475ArchaeologyEgyptRelatedDig to unearth lost manor houses nears endFind could be 'incredibly rare' carving of a faceSearch for ancient Egyptian gold bracelet missing from Cairo museumMore from the BBC10 Sep 2025Marmoush to miss Manchester derby with knee injuryManchester City will be without forward Omar Marmoush for Sunday's Manchester derby after the Egyptian suffers a knee injury on international duty. 10 Sep 20257 Sep 2025Ethiopia outfoxes Egypt over the Nile's waters with its mighty damEthiopia is set to inaugurate a mega dam that has stoked tensions with Egypt.7 Sep 20256 Sep 2025One of the world's most sacred places is being turned into a luxury mega-resortThe biblical site of Mount Sinai in Egypt is at the heart of an unholy row over plans to build a huge new tourism project.6 Sep 20252 Sep 2025African battle for 2026 World Cup spots intensifiesWith four rounds of qualifying remaining, which African sides are most likely to reach the 2026 Fifa World Cup - and who could miss out on the finals?2 Sep 202531 Aug 2025UK shuts embassy building in Cairo amid row over activist's arrestThe removal of the barriers is widely seen as retaliation for the arrest of a pro-Egyptian government activist in London last week.31 Aug 2025British Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
