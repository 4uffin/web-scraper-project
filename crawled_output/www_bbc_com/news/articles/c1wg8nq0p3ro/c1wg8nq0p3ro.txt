Story Picture AgencyEmergency services are seen at Luton Airport following the landingThe helicopters are fitted with missile defence and radar jamming systems as well as electronics designed to withstand the electromagnetic pulse of a nuclear blast.As a security measure, Marine One often flies in a group of identical helicopters acting as decoys.It is also usually accompanied by two or three Osprey MV-22s - tilt-rotor aircraft referred to as "green tops" that combine the vertical landing ability of a helicopter with the flying speed and efficiency of an aeroplane.The Ospreys carry support staff, special forces and secret service agents, who are tasked with dealing with any mid-flight emergency.PA MediaMarine One landed at Chequers in Buckinghamshire as part of Donald Trump's second state visitTrump had been using the helicopter to travel between different locations on his unprecedented second state visit to the UK.He arrived at Stansted late on Tuesday night and was flown to Winfield House in central London - the official residence of the US ambassador to the UK.The following day, President Trump and his wife flew to Windsor Castle where they met the King and Queen.On Thursday, Trump was taken on Marine One from Windsor to Chequers for diplomatic talks with UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer.During a joint news conference at Chequers, the two leaders addressed a range of issues, including Ukraine, Gaza and illegal migration - a subject which Trump suggested Britain could solve by calling in the military. Trump said he had "a disagreement with the prime minister" on the subject of Palestinian statehood.Starmer plans to recognise Palestinian statehood ahead of next week's United Nations general assembly in New York.Luton AirportDonald TrumpRelatedLuton Airport's fire-ravaged car park set to reopenAirport installs 'wish list' for disabled travellersMotorway closed by overturned lorry fuel spillMore from the BBC9 mins ago'There's no way we can afford $100,000': Small firms scramble over H-1B visa feesStartups and smaller firms could bear the brunt of Trump's new H-1B visa fee, and some fear it could thwart US innovation.9 mins ago4 hrs agoWatch: White House replaces President Biden portrait with image of an autopenPresident Donald Trump has previously claimed Biden used an autopen to sign important documents, including pardons.4 hrs ago4 hrs agoLuigi Mangione's lawyers claim Trump violated right to fair trial They say the US president's comments were "part of a greater political narrative that has no place in any criminal case".4 hrs ago6 hrs agoHow doctors are responding to Trump's autism announcement Physicians worry pregnant women may forgo a treatment over an unproven link between Tylenol and autism. 6 hrs ago8 hrs agoSomalia's president: They tried to kill me five timesSomalia's President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud says he is a prime target of the Islamist group al-Shabab. 8 hrs agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
