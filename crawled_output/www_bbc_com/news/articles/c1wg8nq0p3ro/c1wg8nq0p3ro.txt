Story Picture AgencyEmergency services are seen at Luton Airport following the landingThe helicopters are fitted with missile defence and radar jamming systems as well as electronics designed to withstand the electromagnetic pulse of a nuclear blast.As a security measure, Marine One often flies in a group of identical helicopters acting as decoys.It is also usually accompanied by two or three Osprey MV-22s - tilt-rotor aircraft referred to as "green tops" that combine the vertical landing ability of a helicopter with the flying speed and efficiency of an aeroplane.The Ospreys carry support staff, special forces and secret service agents, who are tasked with dealing with any mid-flight emergency.PA MediaMarine One landed at Chequers in Buckinghamshire as part of Donald Trump's second state visitTrump had been using the helicopter to travel between different locations on his unprecedented second state visit to the UK.He arrived at Stansted late on Tuesday night and was flown to Winfield House in central London - the official residence of the US ambassador to the UK.The following day, President Trump and his wife flew to Windsor Castle where they met the King and Queen.On Thursday, Trump was taken on Marine One from Windsor to Chequers for diplomatic talks with UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer.During a joint news conference at Chequers, the two leaders addressed a range of issues, including Ukraine, Gaza and illegal migration - a subject which Trump suggested Britain could solve by calling in the military. Trump said he had "a disagreement with the prime minister" on the subject of Palestinian statehood.Starmer plans to recognise Palestinian statehood ahead of next week's United Nations general assembly in New York.Luton AirportDonald TrumpRelatedLuton Airport's fire-ravaged car park set to reopenAirport installs 'wish list' for disabled travellersMotorway closed by overturned lorry fuel spillMore from the BBC27 mins agoTrump hails Charlie Kirk as 'American hero' as thousands fill memorial serviceKirk's wife, Erika, also delivers a tearful speech in which she says she forgives her husband's alleged killer.27 mins ago1 hr agoWatch: Is America divided?
