Each child could be accompanied by family members if necessary, according to the Mirror.Cooper told the newspaper "it was a lot of diplomatic work in order to help them actually leave Gaza". She added: "But that work is underway and I'm determined to make sure that we can do our bit to help those injured families and also to help students get into their courses this autumn."Some Gazan children have been brought privately to the UK for medical treatment through an initiative by Project Pure Hope, but the government until now had not evacuated any through its own scheme during the conflict.On Saturday, the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza said the bodies of 47 people killed by the Israeli military had arrived at its hospitals over the previous day.Since UN-backed global food security experts confirmed a famine in Gaza City on 22 August, the ministry has reported that at least 142 people have died from starvation and malnutrition across the territory. Earlier this year, the World Health Organization said that Israel's offensive in Gaza had stretched the territory's health system "beyond breaking point". Israel has said it is expanding its efforts to facilitate aid deliveries and has disputed the health ministry's figures on malnutrition-related deaths.The Israeli military launched its campaign in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.At least 64,803 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's health ministry.'We escaped certain death': Israel intensifies Gaza City bombardment, forcing families to flee'Netanyahu, we're not leaving': Defiance in Gaza City as Israel shows aid sites planned for evacueesCooper reaffirms Ukraine support as she visits KyivIsrael-Gaza warYvette CooperGazaRelated'The bombing has been insane': Gaza City Palestinians scramble to flee Israeli assaultIsrael and the Palestinians: History of the conflict explainedIsrael has committed genocide in Gaza, UN commission of inquiry saysMore from the BBC6 hrs agoJeremy Bowen: UN genocide report a blunt indictment of Israel's actions in GazaA new report accuses Israel of committing genocide in Gaza, in "the strongest and most authoritative UN finding to date". 6 hrs ago7 hrs agoIsrael escalates bombardment as defence minister says 'Gaza is burning'It came hours after US Secretary of State Rubio assured Israeli PM Netanyahu of unwavering US support.7 hrs ago20 hrs agoCritically ill children arrive in Scotland from GazaThe Scottish government has committed to supporting the treatment of up to 20 Palestinian youngsters.20 hrs ago21 hrs agoIsrael demolishes more high-rise towers as Gaza City offensive ramps upBBC Verify's Merlyn Thomas looks at the latest Israeli strikes on buildings in Gaza City city over the weekend.21 hrs ago23 hrs agoSpanish PM calls for Israel to be barred from international sportPedro Sánchez says Israel should be treated in the same way as Russia over its war in Ukraine.23 hrs agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
