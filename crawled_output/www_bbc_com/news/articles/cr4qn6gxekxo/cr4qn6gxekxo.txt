Each child could be accompanied by family members if necessary, according to the Mirror.Cooper told the newspaper "it was a lot of diplomatic work in order to help them actually leave Gaza". She added: "But that work is underway and I'm determined to make sure that we can do our bit to help those injured families and also to help students get into their courses this autumn."Some Gazan children have been brought privately to the UK for medical treatment through an initiative by Project Pure Hope, but the government until now had not evacuated any through its own scheme during the conflict.On Saturday, the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza said the bodies of 47 people killed by the Israeli military had arrived at its hospitals over the previous day.Since UN-backed global food security experts confirmed a famine in Gaza City on 22 August, the ministry has reported that at least 142 people have died from starvation and malnutrition across the territory. Earlier this year, the World Health Organization said that Israel's offensive in Gaza had stretched the territory's health system "beyond breaking point". Israel has said it is expanding its efforts to facilitate aid deliveries and has disputed the health ministry's figures on malnutrition-related deaths.The Israeli military launched its campaign in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.At least 64,803 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's health ministry.'We escaped certain death': Israel intensifies Gaza City bombardment, forcing families to flee'Netanyahu, we're not leaving': Defiance in Gaza City as Israel shows aid sites planned for evacueesCooper reaffirms Ukraine support as she visits KyivIsrael-Gaza warYvette CooperGazaRelatedWhy Starmer decided the time was right to recognise a Palestinian stateStarmer set to announce UK recognition of Palestinian state on SundayPortugal confirms it will recognise Palestinian stateMore from the BBC3 days agoIsraeli minister touts Gaza 'real estate bonanza', defying international backlashBezalel Smotrich, an ultranationalist who has been sanctioned by the UK and others, said he was in discussion with the US over the idea. 3 days ago3 days agoGenocide happening in Gaza, Sir Sadiq Khan saysSir Sadiq Khan tells a question time event that he thinks "what's happening in Gaza is a genocide".
