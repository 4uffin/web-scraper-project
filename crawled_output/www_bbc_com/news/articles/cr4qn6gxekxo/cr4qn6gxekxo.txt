Each child could be accompanied by family members if necessary, according to the Mirror.Cooper told the newspaper "it was a lot of diplomatic work in order to help them actually leave Gaza". She added: "But that work is underway and I'm determined to make sure that we can do our bit to help those injured families and also to help students get into their courses this autumn."Some Gazan children have been brought privately to the UK for medical treatment through an initiative by Project Pure Hope, but the government until now had not evacuated any through its own scheme during the conflict.On Saturday, the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza said the bodies of 47 people killed by the Israeli military had arrived at its hospitals over the previous day.Since UN-backed global food security experts confirmed a famine in Gaza City on 22 August, the ministry has reported that at least 142 people have died from starvation and malnutrition across the territory. Earlier this year, the World Health Organization said that Israel's offensive in Gaza had stretched the territory's health system "beyond breaking point". Israel has said it is expanding its efforts to facilitate aid deliveries and has disputed the health ministry's figures on malnutrition-related deaths.The Israeli military launched its campaign in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.At least 64,803 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's health ministry.'We escaped certain death': Israel intensifies Gaza City bombardment, forcing families to flee'Netanyahu, we're not leaving': Defiance in Gaza City as Israel shows aid sites planned for evacueesCooper reaffirms Ukraine support as she visits KyivIsrael-Gaza warYvette CooperGazaRelatedBBC and news agencies launch film calling on Israel to allow foreign journalists into GazaIsraeli strikes kill dozens in Gaza City, hospitals say, as offensive expandsTwenty injured in Yemen drone attack on Israel, rescuers and military sayMore from the BBC10 hrs agoIsraeli forces near Gaza City centre as Hamas reportedly prepares for street-to-street fightingThousands of Palestinians have been forced to flee Gaza City since Israel launched its ground offensive last week.10 hrs ago1 day agoKilled seeking food - Jeremy Bowen on Abdullah's shooting and Gaza's lethal aid systemInside Panorama and BBC Eye's investigation into hunger in Gaza and why so many are risking their lives for aid.1 day ago1 day agoEvacuated Gazan students arrive in the UK to begin studiesThey are the first group who have been helped to escape the conflict so they can attend universities across the UK. 1 day ago1 day agoMinister 'delighted' that students from Gaza have arrived in NIIt is understood that the students are among a group of 34 students that arrived in the UK in recent days.1 day ago2 days agoFootage shows public executions in Gaza City streetHamas-linked social media channels say "three collaborators who were spying for the occupation" were executed.2 days agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
