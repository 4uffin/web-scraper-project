Arc'teryx also said that the spectacle was aimed at raising awareness of mountain culture.Founded in 1989, Arc'teryx is hugely popular for its high-end sportswear and mountaineering gear and runs more than 150 shops globally. It is owned by Hong Kong-listed fitness equipment company Anta Sports. It partnered with pyrotechnics artist Cai to stage the high-altitude day-time display called Rising Dragon, set at over 5,000 meters in Tibet's Shigatse region, a gateway to Himalayan peaks like Everest. The mountains are also sacred to people in Tibet, where many follow Buddhism. It
has been a tightly-controlled part of China since it was annexed in the 1950s, leading some online to ask how and why the project was approved in the first place. Critics said the mountains were too fragile for fireworks, and the explosions, colour and smoke would have disrupted the ecosystem and local wildlife.Getty ImagesA fireworks display by Cai in 2014 in ShanghaiA top comment on Arc'teryx's apology post said the display was "not something that can be forgiven with a single apology post", and urged the company to take responsibility for any long-term environmental impact. Another commenter questioned how a project of such scale could have been approved by so many people."The public's criticism has alerted us that the evaluation of the expression of art needs to be more professional and we need to be more humble and respectful of nature," Arc'teryx said in its statement.Mr Cai, the artist who has also been criticised, has apologised for his role and said he would work with authorities to help in the area's recovery.The 67-year-old artist made his name with gunpowder paintings and outdoor pyrotechnic displays. He famously oversaw fireworks for the 2008 Beijing Olympics.China begins building world's largest dam, fuelling fears in IndiaChina's Xi touts unity and development in surprise Tibet visitInternational BusinessOutdoor activitiesEnvironmentThe HimalayasRelatedBoss jailed for 15 years over deadly fire at S Korea battery plantTikTok child data protection inadequate, Canadian privacy officials sayPorsche shares plunge after announcing EV rollout delayMore from the BBC3 hrs ago'Pathetic' fines won't stop water pollution, say campaignersFigures obtained by BBC News NI show there were 63 fines handed down for water pollution between 2020 and 2024.3 hrs ago1 day agoRed panda dies and leaves cub to be hand-rearedA red panda cub will have to be hand reared after its mother Laya has died.1 day ago2 days agoStudy finds female crabs drawn to power cablesUniversity of Portsmouth researchers have raised concerns about the impact this could have on marine life.2 days ago3 days agoHow to eat less plasticMicroplastics gush out of our taps and flake off cookware.
