Arc'teryx also said that the spectacle was aimed at raising awareness of mountain culture.Founded in 1989, Arc'teryx is hugely popular for its high-end sportswear and mountaineering gear and runs more than 150 shops globally. It is owned by Hong Kong-listed fitness equipment company Anta Sports. It partnered with pyrotechnics artist Cai to stage the high-altitude day-time display called Rising Dragon, set at over 5,000 meters in Tibet's Shigatse region, a gateway to Himalayan peaks like Everest. The mountains are also sacred to people in Tibet, where many follow Buddhism. It
has been a tightly-controlled part of China since it was annexed in the 1950s, leading some online to ask how and why the project was approved in the first place. Critics said the mountains were too fragile for fireworks, and the explosions, colour and smoke would have disrupted the ecosystem and local wildlife.Getty ImagesA fireworks display by Cai in 2014 in ShanghaiA top comment on Arc'teryx's apology post said the display was "not something that can be forgiven with a single apology post", and urged the company to take responsibility for any long-term environmental impact. Another commenter questioned how a project of such scale could have been approved by so many people."The public's criticism has alerted us that the evaluation of the expression of art needs to be more professional and we need to be more humble and respectful of nature," Arc'teryx said in its statement.Mr Cai, the artist who has also been criticised, has apologised for his role and said he would work with authorities to help in the area's recovery.The 67-year-old artist made his name with gunpowder paintings and outdoor pyrotechnic displays. He famously oversaw fireworks for the 2008 Beijing Olympics.China begins building world's largest dam, fuelling fears in IndiaChina's Xi touts unity and development in surprise Tibet visitInternational BusinessOutdoor activitiesEnvironmentThe HimalayasRelatedTrump announces new tariffs on drugs, trucks and kitchen cabinetsThe bacteria turning waste plastic into painkillersChina launches campaign to keep killjoys off the internetMore from the BBC11 hrs agoFarm suspected of river pollution that killed fishThe Environment Agency says a farm may be the source of pollution that killed fish in August.11 hrs ago15 hrs agoTiny islands, a big waste problemTourism is vital for Caribbean economies, but record-breaking numbers of visitors, coupled with insufficient local waste facilities, are leaving many islands choking on rubbish.15 hrs ago16 hrs ago'Pathetic' fines won't stop water pollution, say campaignersFigures obtained by BBC News NI show there were 63 fines handed down for water pollution between 2020 and 2024.16 hrs ago20 hrs agoTimber worth £5m stuck in roadless remote forestUswayford is only accessible via forest tracks and a public road, but has £5m of timber waiting.20 hrs ago2 days agoRed panda dies and leaves cub to be hand-rearedA red panda cub will have to be hand reared after its mother Laya has died.2 days agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseSubscription TermsAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
