Looking at the Royal Collection's historic documents about US independence, he commented: "The real deal."The president has been a long-time admirer of the late Queen Elizabeth and he laid a wreath and paid his respects at her tomb in Windsor.And official gifts were exchanged, including giving the visting president the flag that was flying over Buckingham Palace on the day of Trump's inauguration in January 2025.State visits are a form of soft power diplomacy, using royal hospitality to build relations with important international partners - with none more important than the US.That includes business links, with more heads of technology firms - such as Apple's Tim Cook and Sam Altman of artificial intelligence firm OpenAI - at the state banquet than celebrities.Alongside the state visit, £150bn of US investment into the UK was announced, including £22bn from Microsoft.PA MediaThe Princess of Wales, Queen Camilla and Melania Trump met in the grounds of WindsorPress baron Rupert Murdoch was at the banquet, sitting next to the prime minister's adviser Morgan McSweeney, at the dinner where guests were given a main course of Norfolk organic chicken.As well as hailing the value of the US and UK's partnership, the King stressed the importance of protecting the environment, saying there was a "precious opportunity to safeguard and to restore the wonders and beauty of nature for the generations who follow us".The King and President Trump had a carriage ride into Windsor CastleThe banquet concluded a day of events intended to make a positive impression on the president, in a shock-and-awe display of pageantry.With 1,300 service men and women from the Army, Royal Navy and RAF taking part, this was the largest ever guard of honour planned for a state visit to the UK.The much bigger than usual military line-up for the state visit was the UK government's message to encourage the US to maintain its commitment to Nato and support Ukraine.Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer joined Trump to watch a flypast by the Red Arrows over Windsor, although a planned flypast by F-35 fighter jets was stopped by poor weather conditions.The royal spectacle seemed to have appealed to the president, who described his state visit as one of the "highest honours" of his life.Picture gallery of the state visit so farWhat is the president doing during his visit?America's unofficial party house where presidents stay in LondonHow the UK wants to use the royals to influence TrumpWATCH: BBC correspondents on relationship between PM and presidentSecurity measures - from anti-drones and decoys to bringing in The BeastEPAThere were protesters against the Trump state visit in Windsor But unlike other recent state visits, there were no moments visible to the public, with all the events taking place behind the walls of the Windsor estate or at the PM's country estate, Chequers.A protest against the visit was held in London, but there were also anti-Trump placards in Windsor, out of sight from the US visitors.Protesters included the anti-monarchy group Republic, whose chief executive, Graham Smith said: "It's time to fix our democracy and defend the country from those who might want to undermine what democratic rights we have, whether that be Charles or Trump."Sign up here to get the latest royal stories and analysis every week with our Royal Watch newsletter.
