He said his allegations of rigging were backed by "100% proof" and that the poll panel had not taken action despite repeated complaints from his Congress party. The Election Commission of India (ECI) called the allegations "incorrect and baseless". The BJP also rejected the claims.The latest claims are part of a series of accusations of "vote theft" that Gandhi has made against the panel since early August. Gandhi first raised the issue at a 7 August press conference in Delhi where he had alleged widespread voter manipulation during last year's parliamentary elections, citing data obtained from the electoral body itself.Though the ECI and the ruling party had strongly disputed his interpretation, his claims won him support from many opposition parties. Some former chief election commissioners have also supported him, saying the onus was on the commission to clear up any doubts about the credibility of the election process in the world's most populous country with nearly a billion voters.Why India's Election Commission is facing a test of credibility At his press conference on Thursday, Gandhi cited examples from the Aland assembly constituency in the southern state of Karnataka, alleging that names of more than 6,000 voters were deleted in areas which were his party's strongholds.He said the names were mostly of people from the minority and disadvantaged groups who were known Congress supporters. Congress candidate BR Patil won from the Aland seat in the 2023 Karnataka assembly election and the party is currently in power in the state.Gandhi said the crime department of Karnataka police had been investigating these allegations since 2023 when the party first noticed missing names.The investigators, he said, "had written 18 letters in 18 months to the ECI", seeking details, but had not received any response. He called on "CEC Gyanesh Kumar to release the details within a week".In response, the ECI said voter names could not be deleted online "by any member of the public, as misconceived" by Gandhi. It added that in 2023, "certain unsuccessful attempts were made for deletion of voters in Aland" and that the commission itself had filed a police complaint regarding this. Gandhi also raised the issue of Rajura assembly constituency in the western state of Maharashtra where he alleged that the voters' list had added 6,850 names - many of which were fake. The Election Commission did not address this specific allegation in its response.Rahul GandhiAsiaIndia Election 2024Narendra ModiIndiaRelatedWhy India's Election Commission is facing a test of credibilityThe row over 'vote theft' that has shaken Indian politicsIndia's Gandhis charged in money laundering case amid opposition outcryMore from the BBC3 hrs agoThe sun sets on India's iconic and controversial Soviet fighter jetMiG-21 served in all conflicts with Pakistan since 1965 and was later known for a high crash rate.3 hrs ago7 hrs agoIndia beat Bangladesh to reach Asia Cup finalOpener Abhishek Sharma scores a half-century and Kuldeep Yadav takes three wickets as defending champions India beat Bangladesh in Dubai7 hrs ago13 hrs agoWatch: Typhoon Ragasa leaves trail of destruction in ChinaThe "king of storms" has forced the evacuation of nearly two million people from the southern Chinese province of Guangdong.13 hrs ago14 hrs agoWatch: Moment water shatters glass doors of Hong Kong hotelA person was swept off their feet as water burst into the building. 14 hrs ago15 hrs agoHowling winds and sheets of rain: Inside Chinese city battered by Typhoon RagasaThe strong winds hit in waves - and standing upright is almost impossible, our correspondent writes.15 hrs agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
