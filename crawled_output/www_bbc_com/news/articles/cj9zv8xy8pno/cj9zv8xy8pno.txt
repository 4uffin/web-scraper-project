He said his allegations of rigging were backed by "100% proof" and that the poll panel had not taken action despite repeated complaints from his Congress party. The Election Commission of India (ECI) called the allegations "incorrect and baseless". The BJP also rejected the claims.The latest claims are part of a series of accusations of "vote theft" that Gandhi has made against the panel since early August. Gandhi first raised the issue at a 7 August press conference in Delhi where he had alleged widespread voter manipulation during last year's parliamentary elections, citing data obtained from the electoral body itself.Though the ECI and the ruling party had strongly disputed his interpretation, his claims won him support from many opposition parties. Some former chief election commissioners have also supported him, saying the onus was on the commission to clear up any doubts about the credibility of the election process in the world's most populous country with nearly a billion voters.Why India's Election Commission is facing a test of credibility At his press conference on Thursday, Gandhi cited examples from the Aland assembly constituency in the southern state of Karnataka, alleging that names of more than 6,000 voters were deleted in areas which were his party's strongholds.He said the names were mostly of people from the minority and disadvantaged groups who were known Congress supporters. Congress candidate BR Patil won from the Aland seat in the 2023 Karnataka assembly election and the party is currently in power in the state.Gandhi said the crime department of Karnataka police had been investigating these allegations since 2023 when the party first noticed missing names.The investigators, he said, "had written 18 letters in 18 months to the ECI", seeking details, but had not received any response. He called on "CEC Gyanesh Kumar to release the details within a week".In response, the ECI said voter names could not be deleted online "by any member of the public, as misconceived" by Gandhi. It added that in 2023, "certain unsuccessful attempts were made for deletion of voters in Aland" and that the commission itself had filed a police complaint regarding this. Gandhi also raised the issue of Rajura assembly constituency in the western state of Maharashtra where he alleged that the voters' list had added 6,850 names - many of which were fake. The Election Commission did not address this specific allegation in its response.Rahul GandhiAsiaIndia Election 2024Narendra ModiIndiaRelatedWhy India's Election Commission is facing a test of credibilityThe row over 'vote theft' that has shaken Indian politicsIndia's Gandhis charged in money laundering case amid opposition outcryMore from the BBC59 mins agoSikh granny's arrest by US immigration sparks community angerHarjit Kaur, a 73-year-old who unsuccessfully applied for asylum, was arrested by immigration authorities last week.59 mins ago2 hrs agoHow a man's affair with his mother-in-law became a viral film in IndonesiaNorma, a movie based on a viral true story from TikTok, has become a nationwide obsession.2 hrs ago7 hrs agoIndia defeat Oman to extend unbeaten Asia Cup runIndia maintain their unbeaten streak in the 2025 Asia Cup with a 21-run victory over Oman in their final group match.7 hrs ago18 hrs agoThe lonely life and death of Delhi's only African elephantFor 24 years, Shankar endured a lonely existence - including at least 13 spent in solitary confinement.18 hrs ago20 hrs agoUS revokes visas of Indian executives over alleged fentanyl traffickingThe US embassy said “these individuals and close family members may be ineligible for travel” to the US.20 hrs agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
