He announced Monday, 29 September, as a holiday to celebrate the achievement - a day ahead of the country's independence day.On Sunday, Botswana's team of Lee Bhekempilo Eppie, Letsile Tebogo, Bayapo Ndori and Busang Collen Kebinatshipi edged out the US, the winners of the last 10 world titles, in a rain-drenched race.
South Africa took third position."I'll be sure to tell everyone, Botswana's natural diamonds are not just in the ground, they are our World Champion athletes," the president said, speaking from New York where he is attending the UN General Assembly.He described the moment as "electric", adding that Botswana's performance spoke to its rising stature on the global stage.The southern African nation finished fifth overall in the championship's medal standings - behind the US, Kenya, the Netherlands and Canada -
their best ever return after taking two golds, one silver and a bronze.Last year, Botswana celebrated another historic milestone as Tebogo won the nation's first Olympic gold medal with his victory in the men's 200m in Paris.His triumph, which also marked the first time an African athlete had won the event, became a national sensation, with tens of thousands of people celebrating him at the National Stadium in the capital, Gaborone, after he returned to the country.The government declared a half-day holiday allowing citizens to "pause and celebrate him" - in what then-President Mokgweetsi Masisi described as a "most unique… manner that will be etched in the annals of the history of the Republic".You may also be interested in:Botswana welcomes Tebogo home with stadium spectacularLetsile Tebogo's rise from 'hyperactive child'What it's like to be your country's only OlympianBotswana's politician who did the unthinkableWatch: Moment Botswana's president feels weight of giant diamondGetty Images/BBCGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.Follow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafricaBBC Africa podcastsFocus on AfricaThis Is AfricaBotswanaAfricaRelatedMore than 80 buffaloes drown in Namibia after falling off cliffDiamond-rich Botswana declares national public health emergencyBotswana's diamond giant slashes output as demand fallsMore from the BBC2 hrs agoWhy a tiny island's fate could decide Seychelles' next presidentIndia, Qatari royals, China and ecologists have their own, very different, views on Assumption Island's future.2 hrs ago14 hrs agoFrench navy seizes nearly 10 tonnes of cocaine off West African coastFrench authorities say the "remarkable seizure" was found on board a fishing boat following a tip-off.14 hrs ago18 hrs agoMalawi's ex-president wins election in comeback at age 85Peter Mutharika defeated the incumbent, Lazarus Chakwera, the election commission announces.18 hrs ago18 hrs agoThe professor who beat fraud allegations to become Malawi's president…againThe president-elect of the southern African nation has a long and controversial political career.18 hrs ago1 day agoSomalia's president: They tried to kill me five timesSomalia's President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud says he is a prime target of the Islamist group al-Shabab. 1 day agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseSubscription TermsAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
