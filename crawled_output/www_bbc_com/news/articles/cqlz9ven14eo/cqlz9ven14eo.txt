He announced Monday, 29 September, as a holiday to celebrate the achievement - a day ahead of the country's independence day.On Sunday, Botswana's team of Lee Bhekempilo Eppie, Letsile Tebogo, Bayapo Ndori and Busang Collen Kebinatshipi edged out the US, the winners of the last 10 world titles, in a rain-drenched race.
South Africa took third position."I'll be sure to tell everyone, Botswana's natural diamonds are not just in the ground, they are our World Champion athletes," the president said, speaking from New York where he is attending the UN General Assembly.He described the moment as "electric", adding that Botswana's performance spoke to its rising stature on the global stage.The southern African nation finished fifth overall in the championship's medal standings - behind the US, Kenya, the Netherlands and Canada -
their best ever return after taking two golds, one silver and a bronze.Last year, Botswana celebrated another historic milestone as Tebogo won the nation's first Olympic gold medal with his victory in the men's 200m in Paris.His triumph, which also marked the first time an African athlete had won the event, became a national sensation, with tens of thousands of people celebrating him at the National Stadium in the capital, Gaborone, after he returned to the country.The government declared a half-day holiday allowing citizens to "pause and celebrate him" - in what then-President Mokgweetsi Masisi described as a "most unique… manner that will be etched in the annals of the history of the Republic".You may also be interested in:Botswana welcomes Tebogo home with stadium spectacularLetsile Tebogo's rise from 'hyperactive child'What it's like to be your country's only OlympianBotswana's politician who did the unthinkableWatch: Moment Botswana's president feels weight of giant diamondGetty Images/BBCGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.Follow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafricaBBC Africa podcastsFocus on AfricaThis Is AfricaBotswanaAfricaRelatedDiamond-rich Botswana declares national public health emergencyBotswana's diamond giant slashes output as demand fallsSuspected people-smuggling gang arrested in raidsMore from the BBC16 hrs ago'I'm Kenyan, don't shoot' - the athlete who says he was duped into the Russian armyEvans Kibet, now being held in Ukraine after surrendering, says he did not know he was signing up.16 hrs ago2 days agoMurdered Kenyan's friends want UK soldier to face justiceFriends of the stabbed 21-year-old Kenyan woman recount to the BBC events on the night she went missing.2 days ago2 days agoMalawi police arrest eight for alleged election fraudOfficials are on high alert after the 2019 presidential election result was annulled due to vote tampering.2 days ago2 days agoSouth Africa police uncover $20m crystal meth labFive North Americans were arrested after the raid on a farm in the east of the country, officers say.2 days ago3 days agoDrone strike on Sudan mosque kills 78, medic tells BBCLocal activists and residents describe the early morning attack on worshippers.3 days agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
