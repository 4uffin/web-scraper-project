The Malawi Electoral Commission has until the end of Wednesday to announce it.At least two of the 12 districts still to declare results have a large number of registered voters, and Chakwera's camp believes he will do well there. These includes rural areas around Lilongwe and Dedza.Two other districts, where Mutharika is expected to do well, have had their results withheld by the electoral commission as it checks whether they are accurate.The commission said it was committed to transparency, accuracy and credibility. It added that it was carefully checking every tally sheet, after the constitutional court annulled Mutharika's victory in 2019 because of irregularities.Chakwera won the re-run by a wide margin, but during his presidency Malawi's economic crisis has deepened, with high inflation, food and fuel shortages and constant power cuts.On Friday, Chakwera's party said it had discovered "irregularities" and "serious anomalies", and had asked the electoral commission to conduct a "physical audit" of results. The party did not specify the irregularities.Police said eight data entry clerks had been arrested on accusations of trying to manipulate results.You may also be interested in:What is at stake in Malawi's elections as cost-of-living bites?Malawi police arrest eight for alleged election fraudHow brave judges rejected a 'second-rate election''I tell my children not to play so we save money on soap'Getty Images/BBCGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.Follow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafricaBBC Africa podcastsFocus on AfricaThis Is AfricaLazarus ChakweraMalawiPeter MutharikaAfricaRelatedMalawi's ex-president wins election in comeback at age 85Queen Elizabeth's death 'is an end of an era'Malawi leader defends bringing family to summitMore from the BBC8 hrs agoSomalia's president: They tried to kill me five timesSomalia's President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud says he is a prime target of the Islamist group al-Shabab. 8 hrs ago9 hrs agoWhy Kordofan is key in Sudan's civil warThe battle for Kordofan, with a population of eight million, is the latest frontline in Sudan's civil war.9 hrs ago11 hrs agoLandmark deal paves way for cheaper HIV protection jabThe drug - a twice-yearly injection – reduces the current HIV treatment cost in developing countries. 11 hrs ago13 hrs agoThe professor who beat fraud allegations to become Malawi's president…againThe president-elect of the southern African nation has a long and controversial political career.13 hrs ago14 hrs agoSix West Africans deported from US sent to Togo despite legal fightThey had started legal action against Ghana for agreeing to accept them from the US.14 hrs agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
