The Malawi Electoral Commission has until the end of Wednesday to announce it.At least two of the 12 districts still to declare results have a large number of registered voters, and Chakwera's camp believes he will do well there. These includes rural areas around Lilongwe and Dedza.Two other districts, where Mutharika is expected to do well, have had their results withheld by the electoral commission as it checks whether they are accurate.The commission said it was committed to transparency, accuracy and credibility. It added that it was carefully checking every tally sheet, after the constitutional court annulled Mutharika's victory in 2019 because of irregularities.Chakwera won the re-run by a wide margin, but during his presidency Malawi's economic crisis has deepened, with high inflation, food and fuel shortages and constant power cuts.On Friday, Chakwera's party said it had discovered "irregularities" and "serious anomalies", and had asked the electoral commission to conduct a "physical audit" of results. The party did not specify the irregularities.Police said eight data entry clerks had been arrested on accusations of trying to manipulate results.You may also be interested in:What is at stake in Malawi's elections as cost-of-living bites?Malawi police arrest eight for alleged election fraudHow brave judges rejected a 'second-rate election''I tell my children not to play so we save money on soap'Getty Images/BBCGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.Follow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafricaBBC Africa podcastsFocus on AfricaThis Is AfricaLazarus ChakweraMalawiPeter MutharikaAfricaRelatedQueen Elizabeth's death 'is an end of an era'Malawi leader defends bringing family to summitMore from the BBC9 mins agoMore than 80 buffaloes drown in Namibia after falling off cliffThe herd was fleeing lions, officials say9 mins ago2 hrs agoEswatini says it has repatriated US deportee to JamaicaOrville Isaac Etoria had been held in prison in the southern African state after Trump's government expelled him.2 hrs ago6 hrs agoThree West African countries to quit International Criminal CourtThe three military juntas, who came to power through coups, say the judicial body is 'incapable' of handling 'proven war crimes'.6 hrs ago1 day ago'I'm Kenyan, don't shoot' - the athlete who says he was duped into the Russian armyEvans Kibet, now being held in Ukraine after surrendering, says he did not know he was signing up.1 day ago1 day agoBotswana declares public holiday after 'historic' athletics gold medalPresident Duma Boko congratulates the men's 4x400m relay team for winning gold at the World Athletic Championships.1 day agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
