At the start of a criminal trial, jurors are told that there are two acquittal verdicts - but it is not explained how they differ.Justice Secretary Angela Constance said it was a "widely misunderstood" verdict that "traumatises" victims and leaves a "lingering stigma on the accused".However, the Law Society of Scotland has argued that its removal risks an increase in miscarriages of justice.A study published in 2019 said removing the not proven verdict might incline more jurors towards a guilty verdict in finely balanced trials. It also highlighted inconsistent views on the meaning of not proven and how it differed from not guilty.The latest Scottish government figures, for 2022/23, show that 1% of people facing criminal charges in court were acquitted on a not proven verdict, compared to 4% on a not guilty verdict.The reforms in the government's bill also include a change in how guilty verdicts are decided.Scottish juries have 15 members and at present a simple majority of eight jurors is required for a verdict. Under the new two-thirds rule, that will be raised to 10 out of 15 jurors.Raising the bar for guilty verdicts is intended to allay the concerns of some defence lawyers who fear the the abolition of the not proven verdict could increase the risk of wrongful convictions.The reforms also pave the way for: the creation of a special sexual offences court, including "trauma-informed" training for judges and legal staffa victims and witnesses commissioner - an independent office answerable to parliament that would be in charge of ensuring standards of carea requirement for the parole board to consider if a murderer has refused to reveal the location of their victim's remains when considering if they should be freed from jail, and to take into account the safety of victims and their familiesthe extension of rules that restrict what can be said in court about a complainer's sexual history a trial scheme giving victims of rape and serious sexual assault free access to court transcripts to be made permanent Ministers have not set a timetable for scrapping the not proven verdict or introducing a two-thirds majority for guilty verdicts. These changes will require judges and court staff to undergo training.It could take significantly longer to set up a sexual offences court and a victims commissioner.Most rape cases reported to police do not lead to prosecutions. To address this, ministers proposed a pilot scheme that would have allowed trials for serious sexual offences to be held without a jury and decided by a single judge.However, this measure was dropped following criticism from lawyers and judges.'Compassion, dignity and justice'Victim Support Scotland chief executive Kate Wallace said the passage of the bill was a "momentous occasion"."It marks a significant step towards creating a system that considers and prioritises the needs of people impacted by crime," she said. Rape Crisis chief executive Sandy Brindley welcomed the removal of the not proven verdict, which she said had "let down" victims.However, she also expressed "serious concerns" about the increase to the jury majority and "the negative effect that this will almost certainly have on rape and sexual offence cases".The Law Society of Scotland said it supported the creation of a victims commissioner and the granting of automatic lifelong anonymity for victims of sexual offences.But it warned that introducing "untested" changes to the justice system could raise the risk of miscarriages of justice. Stuart Munro, convener of the society's Criminal Law Committee, said: "Every legal system with a two-verdict system requires a unanimous or near unanimous jury to convict, whereas Scotland will now have a system where a person can be convicted despite five members of the jury having significant doubts about their guilt."The bill was supported by SNP, Liberal Democrat and Green MSPs. Constance said the legislation would "put victims and witnesses at the heart of a modern and fair justice system".
Greens justice spokeswoman Maggie Chapman told MSPs it would help deliver "compassion, dignity and justice for victims".While there was broad agreement in parliament over abolishing the not proven verdict, Conservative and Labour MSPs voted against the bill.They raised objections to pushing through such a wide range of measures in one bill and being given limited time to debate complex amendments.Tory MSP Sharon Dowry said the legislation would "waste millions on cosmetic solutions that will make little difference to victims".Labour justice spokeswoman Pauline McNeill raised concerns about taking serious sexual offence cases out of the high court and into a specialist court.Her colleague Katy Clark added that the bill was "far too large" and that several amendments received too little scrutiny.MSPs to back plan to scrap not proven verdict from Scots lawScottish courts to scrap 'not proven' verdictScottish judges remove barrier for rape cases going to courtScottish governmentScotlandCriminal justice systemScottish ParliamentRelatedShipyard survival depends on policy 'step change'Scottish alcohol deaths at lowest rate for five yearsRent controls set to pass in new housing bill - but not for all tenantsMore from the BBC3 hrs agoFirst extreme wildfire warning in September since 2020The fire service says Scotland has faced an "unprecedented scale" of wildfire risk this year.3 hrs ago5 hrs agoUniversity boss calls for major review of Scottish higher educationSir Anton Muscatelli calls for a review of the future funding and shape of higher education.5 hrs ago8 hrs agoStarmer vows to lead Labour into Holyrood electionThe prime minister denies he has ruined Anas Sarwar's chances of becoming the next first minister.8 hrs ago12 hrs agoSTV to cut 60 jobs and axe north news programme The Scottish broadcaster is seeking £2.5m of savings by next year after announcing a £0.2m loss.12 hrs ago13 hrs agoBank of Scotland to close 13 more branches The closures include four in the Highlands - Nairn, Dingwall, Gairloch and Tain.13 hrs agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseSubscription TermsAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
