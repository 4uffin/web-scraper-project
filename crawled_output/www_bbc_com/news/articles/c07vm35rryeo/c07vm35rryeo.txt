Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, suggested the reason for Trump's change of tone was that he had just talked to the Ukrainian president. The US president, he told reporters, had made the comments "apparently under the influence of the vision put forward by Zelensky... this vision is in absolute contrast with our understanding of the current state of affairs". "The thesis that Ukraine can fight something back, we believe it erroneous. The situation on the front line speaks for itself."Trump explained that his position had changed "after getting to know and fully understand the Ukraine/Russia military and economic situation"."Putin and Russia are in BIG Economic trouble, and this is the time for Ukraine to act," he added, labelling Russia as a "paper tiger".The Kremlin spokesman responded by insisting "Russia is in no way a tiger". "It's more associated with a bear and there is no such thing as a paper bear," he told Russia's RBK Radio. He also denied Russia was in economic trouble, but conceded
there were "points of tension" in some sectors linked to global sanctions on Russia.Zelensky hailed the "big shift" in Trump's position, and speaking to reporters in the UN building, said he understood the US was willing to give Ukraine security guarantees "after the war is finished".Pressed on what this would look like, he added: "I don't want to lie, we don't have specific details," but broached the possibility of more weapons, air defences and drones.Speaking later on Fox News, Zelensky said that Trump's Truth Social post about Ukraine's positioning surprised him but he took it as a "positive signal" that Trump and the US "will be with us to the end of the war". "I think the fact that Putin was lying to President Trump so many times also made a difference between us," he told Fox host Bret Baier.Six years ago Trump's UN audience laughed, this year they were silentTrump criticises countries' migration and climate policies in scathing UN speechEarlier on Tuesday, following his speech to the UN, Trump also said Nato nations should shoot down Russian planes breaching their airspace, following a series of recent incursions by Russian fighter jets and drones.Poland's foreign minister, Radoslaw Sikorski, responded on social media with a brief message of approval: "Roger that."Last week, Estonia and Poland requested a consultation with other Nato members after Russia violated its airspace in separate incidents. Romania, another Nato member, also said Russian drones breached its airspace.After meeting on Tuesday, Nato issued a statement condemning Russia's actions and warned that it would use "all necessary military and non-military tools" to defend itself."Russia bears full responsibility for these actions, which are escalatory, risk miscalculation and endanger lives. They must stop," it said.The alliance added that Moscow's actions were part of a "pattern of increasingly irresponsible" behaviour.Nato's secretary general Mark Rutte said: "We are a defensive alliance, yes, but we are not naive, so we see what is happening."Speaking at the UN, Poland's president Karol Nawrocki echoed those comments, saying his country was prepared to "defend its territory" and "react adequately"."Polish people, as well as countries of Central and Eastern Europe, will not be scared of Russian drones," he said.Russia denied violating Estonia's airspace, while it insisted the Polish incursion was not deliberate and did not comment on the Romania incident.Asked if the US would support its Nato allies if they shot down Russian aircraft, Trump said it "depends on the circumstance" and praised the military alliance for increasing defence spending."Nato has stepped up," he said, referring to an agreement by leaders to ramp up defence spending to 5% of their countries' economic output by 2035.In his speech hours earlier, Trump criticised some Nato members for not ceasing the purchase of Russian energy, saying they were "funding a war against themselves".Trump also met European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen at the UN on Tuesday, and she made clear that the European Union was tightening the pressure on Russian oil and gas exports. "By 2027, Europe will have turned the page on Russian fossil fuels for good," she posted on X.Tuesday's Truth Social post represents an about-face after Trump spent most of the year insisting that Ukraine's situation was dire.In February, Trump told Zelensky during their fiery Oval Office exchange that he did "not have the cards right now" to prevail against a larger, more populous nation in a war of attrition.Before talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska in August, Trump said he would try to get some territory back for Ukraine but warned there would be "some swapping, changes in land".There were reports he was planning to press Zelensky to surrender the entirety of the eastern Ukrainian regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in return for Russia freezing the rest of the front line - a proposal put forward by Putin in Alaska.Trump has also repeatedly threatened to impose tougher measures on Russia, but has so far failed to take any action when the Kremlin ignored his deadlines and threats of sanctions.Unpredictability has long been one of the US president's foreign policy trademarks, and perhaps this latest move is an attempt to shake up peace negotiations that have been stagnant for more than a month after Trump hosted Russian President Vladimir Putin at a summit in Alaska.The most notable portion of Trump's post may be the way it ended - with an assurance the US would continue to sell arms to Nato that it could then pass along to Ukraine. It is not the seemingly near open-ended commitment to the war effort that the Biden administration provided, but it is more than Trump seemed interested in offering at times this year.Ukraine in maps: Tracking the war with RussiaFrom escalators to teleprompters, Trump piles on criticism at the UNEuropeWar in UkraineRussiaDonald TrumpNatoVolodymyr ZelenskyUkraineRelatedDrone attacks leave Denmark exposed - and searching for responseGreece extradites oligarch to Moldova in $1bn fraud caseWoman in Spanish cold case identified after 20 yearsMore from the BBC40 mins agoTrump announces new tariffs on drugs, trucks and kitchen cabinetsThe US president said the move aims to help protect American manufacturers from foreign imports.40 mins ago1 hr agoComey indictment escalates Trump's promise of political retributionThe criminal case against Comey fulfils the president's desire to seek retribution and further raises concerns about abuse of power.1 hr ago2 hrs agoWatch: 'I'm not afraid', says James Comey after indictmentThe former FBI director said he had "great confidence in the federal judicial system" after being indicted on two charges.2 hrs ago2 hrs agoFormer FBI director James Comey indicted on two chargesJames Comey says he is innocent after being accused of lying to Congress in 2020 while testifying about leaks to the media.2 hrs ago7 hrs agoTrump claims a TikTok deal is done.
