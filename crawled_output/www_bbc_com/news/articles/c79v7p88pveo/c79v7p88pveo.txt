Coca-Cola and Colgate-Palmolive have also noted a slump in North American sales from Hispanic consumers.Overall, the US beer industry has had a lacklustre year as US drinking habits are changing.American have dialled down their beer consumption over the past four decades, according to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.Anheuser-Busch's recent success comes after a difficult 2023.As well as being facing boycotts for its social media work with Ms Mulvaney, Anheuser-Busch response to the criticism, which included putting two executives blamed for the relationship on leave, was also criticised.Bud Light sales sank and it lost its spot as the top-selling beer in the US after more than two decades.Anheuser-Busch on Monday said the launch of Michelob Ultra Zero, a non-alcoholic beer, has helped propel the brand's popularity. The brewer has also invested in marketing for Michelob Ultra, including at the FIFA Club World Cup and other major sporting events.Bud Light boycott over trans influencer hits salesBud Light loses top spot in US after boycottBusiness chiefs urge Trump to ease up on immigration crackdown after Hyundai raidCompaniesAlcohol industryBeerRelatedBosch to cut 13,000 jobs to save billions in costsJLR restarts some IT systems after cyber-attackGovernment could buy car parts to protect Jaguar Land Rover suppliersMore from the BBC7 days agoBrewer applies to create 'beer school'Bully Brews wants to use the unit at Duck Farm Workshops near Dorchester for beer education.7 days ago15 Sep 2025Beers recalled in 'precautionary' labelling alertThe brewery said it had not been clear enough about potential cereal allergies from its products. 15 Sep 202512 Sep 2025Cancelled beer festival is 'major loss' for cityOxford CAMRA says a lack of volunteers and rising costs played a role in the decision.12 Sep 20259 Sep 2025Brewery celebrates reopening with
