"The time for being soft on these Illegal Immigrant Criminals is OVER under my watch," Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform. Chandra Mouli Nagamallaiah, 50, was attacked with a machete by his co-worker Yordanis Cobos-Martinez in front of his wife and child, following a heated argument over a broken washing machine. The accused, who is now in custody, has been charged with murder.Trump has long vowed tougher enforcement against undocumented migrants, making it a central plank of his policy.Trump said Mr Cobos-Martinez "will be prosecuted to the fullest extent" of the law and will be "charged with murder in the first degree".He also criticised the Biden administration in his post saying Mr Cobos-Martinez was previously arrested for several crimes, including alleged child abuse, but was "released back into society because Cuba declined to accept his return".According to the Department of Homeland Security, Mr Cobos-Martinez is an undocumented immigrant, with a final order of removal from the US.The department claims he was in custody at a detention center in Dallas but was released on an order of supervision in January after Cuba "would not accept him because of his criminal history". Nagamallaiah, who belonged to the southern Indian state of Karnataka, worked at the Downtown Suites Motel in Dallas.He went to school and college in the southern Indian city of Bengaluru before moving to the US in 2018. His son graduated high school recently and is preparing to begin college, according to a news report on NDTV news channel.The assault took place on 10 September. The police said they received a "stabbing" call and a preliminary investigation determined that Mr Cobos-Martinez had cut the victim with an edged weapon several times. US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has lodged Mr Cobos-Martinez with the Dallas County Jail, where he is being held. Nagamallaiah's funeral was held on 13 September in Flower Mound, Texas, and was attended by family and friends. A fundraiser launched to support his family has raised more than $321,000 (£2,36,723), according to news agency PTI.Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.AsiaImmigrationIndiaDonald TrumpUnited StatesRelatedTop court grants relief to private zoo run by billionaire Ambani familyIndia court stays key provisions of controversial new law on Muslim propertiesNepal's interim PM to hand over power within six monthsMore from the BBCJust nowChina accuses Nvidia of violating anti-monopoly lawsThe accusation comes as the US and China hold talks to de-escalate the trade war between the two.Just now3 hrs agoKirk suspect 'not co-operating' with authorities, governor saysHe adds that "much more evidence and information" will become available once charges are filed in the case.3 hrs ago3 hrs agoBrazil's Lula hits back at Trump over Bolsonaro trial and tariffsIn an essay, he says Brazil's democracy and sovereignty "are not on the table" after clashes with the White House.3 hrs ago4 hrs agoDonald Trump's UK state visit is this week - here's what we knowUS President Donald Trump and his wife Melania will carry out their second UK state visit in September.4 hrs ago5 hrs agoWatch: Winning moments from the 77th Emmy AwardsAdolescence star Owen Cooper became the youngest ever male winner and The Pitt took out the top drama series award.5 hrs agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
