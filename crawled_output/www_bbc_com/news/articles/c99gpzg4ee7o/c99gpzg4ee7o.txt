"The time for being soft on these Illegal Immigrant Criminals is OVER under my watch," Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform. Chandra Mouli Nagamallaiah, 50, was attacked with a machete by his co-worker Yordanis Cobos-Martinez in front of his wife and child, following a heated argument over a broken washing machine. The accused, who is now in custody, has been charged with murder.Trump has long vowed tougher enforcement against undocumented migrants, making it a central plank of his policy.Trump said Mr Cobos-Martinez "will be prosecuted to the fullest extent" of the law and will be "charged with murder in the first degree".He also criticised the Biden administration in his post saying Mr Cobos-Martinez was previously arrested for several crimes, including alleged child abuse, but was "released back into society because Cuba declined to accept his return".According to the Department of Homeland Security, Mr Cobos-Martinez is an undocumented immigrant, with a final order of removal from the US.The department claims he was in custody at a detention center in Dallas but was released on an order of supervision in January after Cuba "would not accept him because of his criminal history". Nagamallaiah, who belonged to the southern Indian state of Karnataka, worked at the Downtown Suites Motel in Dallas.He went to school and college in the southern Indian city of Bengaluru before moving to the US in 2018. His son graduated high school recently and is preparing to begin college, according to a news report on NDTV news channel.The assault took place on 10 September. The police said they received a "stabbing" call and a preliminary investigation determined that Mr Cobos-Martinez had cut the victim with an edged weapon several times. US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has lodged Mr Cobos-Martinez with the Dallas County Jail, where he is being held. Nagamallaiah's funeral was held on 13 September in Flower Mound, Texas, and was attended by family and friends. A fundraiser launched to support his family has raised more than $321,000 (£2,36,723), according to news agency PTI.Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.AsiaImmigrationIndiaDonald TrumpUnited StatesRelatedControversial church leader denies bribing ex-South Korea first ladyFury over corruption and 'nepo babies' as floods paralyse PhilippinesTimor-Leste scraps plan to buy MPs free cars after protestsMore from the BBC6 mins agoWhy America is at a dangerous crossroads following the Charlie Kirk shooting This moment has parallels with other periods of discord in US history, but it is more complicated than simply repeating them.6 mins ago36 mins agoBody found in car registered to D4vd identified as missing teenAuthorities say the cause and time of the 15-year-old girl's death are still unknown.36 mins ago1 hr agoJimmy Kimmel taken off air over Charlie Kirk commentsThe late-night host said on Monday that Trump's allies were "doing everything they can to score political points from" Kirk's death.1 hr ago1 hr ago'Ultimate in cancel culture': Fans outside Jimmy Kimmel studio react to show's axingThe BBC spoke to fans who expressed surprise and disappointment after the late night show was taken off air "indefinitely" over Charlie Kirk comments.1 hr ago2 hrs agoWhat was on the menu and who was on guest list at state banquet?Chicken and a special cocktail are being served, while Rupert Murdoch and Tim Cook are among the guests.2 hrs agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
