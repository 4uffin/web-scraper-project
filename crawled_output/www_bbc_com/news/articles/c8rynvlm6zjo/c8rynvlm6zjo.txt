They are usually arranged at the invitation of the monarch, acting on government advice.As well as being grand occasions, the visits are used by governments to further Britain's interests.The president was hosted for a first state visit by the late Queen Elizabeth II in June 2019, during his first term as president.Traditionally, US presidents serving a second term are not offered a state visit. Instead, they are invited for tea or lunch with the monarch, as happened with former presidents Barack Obama and George W Bush. However, in February Sir Keir handed Trump an invitation from King Charles during a White House meeting to discuss a UK-US trade deal.
