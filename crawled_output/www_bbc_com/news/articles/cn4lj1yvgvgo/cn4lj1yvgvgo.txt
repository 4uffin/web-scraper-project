"It is not known where the drones came from. It is also not known where they have since flown," Deputy Police Inspector Jakob Hansen told reporters. "We wish we knew where they were at this time, but we are operating based on what the situation is right now."Operations at the airport resumed at around 00:30 local time (23:30 BST)
after flights were suspended for almost four hours following a drone sighting. Police said that "a number of measures will be implemented" as part of the investigation, but would not confirm what these measures might be. On Monday evening, between two to three large drones were reported flying in the area around Copenhagen Airport, according to authorities. Take-offs and landings at the airport were suspended for approximately four hours.In a statement, the airport warned of ongoing delays and cancellations, and urged passengers to check the status of their flight with their airlines.Asked by reporters if the drones were of Russian origin, Mr Hansen said he could not confirm or deny this. Police said there would be another press conference at 07:00 local time on Tuesday 23 September. A spokesperson for Copenhagen Airport confirmed that the airspace over the airport was closed at around around 20:30 local time (19:30 BST) due to unidentified drones. "No aircraft can take off or land at the airport, and as a result, several flights are being diverted to other airports," they said in a statement. "Police are investigating the matter and we currently have to timeline for reopening."Flight-tracking website Flightradar24 reported that at least 35 flights bound for Copenhagen had been diverted as a result of the airport's closure. A drone was also observed near Oslo Airport on Monday evening, Norwegian police confirmed to local media outlet nrk. A spokesperson for the airport told nrk that airspace above the airport was closed at 00:00 local time (11:00 BST) due to "drone observation", and all flights would be diverted to the nearest airport.
