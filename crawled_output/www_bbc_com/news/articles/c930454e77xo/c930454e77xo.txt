Australia - one of the world's biggest polluters per capita - has already reached warming of above 1.5C, the report said, noting that at 3C, heat-related deaths in Sydney may rise by more than 400% and almost triple in Melbourne.The 72-page report - released days before the government announces its emissions reduction targets for 2035 - found that no Australian community will be immune from climate risks that will be "cascading, compounding and concurrent".It warned of more heatwave-related deaths, poorer water quality due to severe flooding and bushfires, and a A$611bn ($406bn; £300bn) drop in property values.By 2050, the report found the number of coastal communities located in "high and very high risk areas" in Australia will increase and if populations levels remain stable, this will mean more than 1.5 million people will be at risk.Areas in northern Australia, along with remote communities and outer suburbs of major cities, were particularly at risk, the report said."This will put pressure on health, critical infrastructure, natural species and ecosystems, and primary industries," the report warned, as well as posing extra challenges for emergency responders.The report also found that coral reefs such as the Great Barrier Reef in Queensland and Ningaloo Reef in Western Australia - both already hit by record bleaching events - will face higher risks of "bleaching and biodiversity loss" due to warmer oceans.Great Barrier Reef suffers worst coral decline on recordWorst bleaching on record for Western Australian coral reefsWatch: Tropical storm erodes iconic Australian beach"One thing that is very clear from this climate assessment is that our whole country has a lot at stake," Bowen said. "The cost of inaction will always outweigh the cost of action."In response to the report, the government released a national adaptation plan which detailed how federal, state and local governments can work together to tackle climate issues, according to Bowen."We will also set an ambitious and achievable 2035 target, informed by advice from the independent Climate Change Authority," he said, referring to the body that provides advice on climate policy.Australia has pledged to reduce emissions by 43% by 2030, but is criticised for its continued heavy reliance on fossil fuels. Climate Council chief executive Amanda McKenzie said the report's findings were terrifying and called on the government to commit to higher emissions cuts."Australia cannot afford a timid 2035 target when our own government data shows the catastrophic costs of inaction," the head of the the non-profit said."The longer we delay the deep and sustained cuts to climate pollution we need, the harder it becomes to protect communities from escalating heatwaves, floods and bushfire weather."Effects of global warmingClimateAustraliaRelatedRatmageddon: Why rats are overrunning our citiesDuo guilty of pouring latex on Tesla dummy robotMinisters yet to seek climate advice on Heathrow expansionMore from the BBC19 hrs agoMission to save Antarctic port from deteriorationThe mission aims to protect the historic base which is home to the world’s southernmost post office.19 hrs ago1 day agoKindergarten parents told to pay thousands for kids' art - sparking uproar and a midnight heistThe debt-ridden centre said the money would go towards paying overdue bills.1 day ago1 day agoChina makes landmark pledge to cut its climate emissionsIt is China's first firm goal to reduce emissions but falls well short of what is needed to meet global targets.1 day ago2 days agoClimate change will 'lead to noisier take offs' Scientists at the University of Reading say airports will get noisier with warmer air changing how aircraft take off 2 days ago2 days agoGaza City medics describe hospital overwhelmed by casualties from Israeli strikesAustralian doctors say they are having to operate in filthy conditions with few or no anaesthetics.2 days agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseSubscription TermsAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
