He underwent treatment in Germany, and was arrested at the airport upon his return to Russia.At the time of his death he had been in jail for three years on trumped-up charges and had recently been transferred to a penal colony in the Arctic Circle.Navalny's supporters and colleagues at his Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK) have always maintained the Russian government was involved in his demise.Navalnaya said that after her husband's death in February 2024 his team were able to "obtain and securely transfer" biological samples abroad and that two laboratories in different countries had concluded he had been poisoned.She did not share the location of the laboratories - but she implied that they were not making their findings public due to "political considerations"."They don't want an inconvenient truth to surface at the wrong time," she said.Navalnaya also suggested she would get pushback on trying to investigate her husband's death further: "'You are the wife, of course, but there is no criminal case, there are no legal grounds to hand documents to you.'""But I have grounds. Not legal, but moral grounds."Did democratic opposition in Russia die with Alexei Navalny?Russian opposition leader's 'principled and fearless' widowShe added that Navalny had been her husband, friend and closest person – and "a symbol of hope for a better future for our country"."I know he was a symbol to you too," she said over images of Navalny's Moscow funeral which drew thousands despite warnings from the authorities not to attend."I will not be silent. I affirm that Vladimir Putin is guilty of killing my husband, Alexei Navalny... I urge the laboratories which conducted studies to make the results public."On Wednesday Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said he was unaware of Navalnaya's statements.@pevchikh/XNavalny's foundation released photos said to show the exercise yard and punishment cell where he vomited and collapsed on the day he diedIn the video, Navalnaya also detailed her husband's last days based on what she said was testimony by employees at the penal colony, which the BBC has not been able to verify.According to her, on the day he died Navalny was taken out for a walk but felt ill. When he was taken back to his cell "he lay down on the floor, pulled his knees up, and started moaning in pain... then he started vomiting"."Alexei was having convulsions... the prison guards watched [his] agony through the bars of the cell window," she said, citing the alleged testimonies.An ambulance wasn't called until 40 minutes after Navalny became ill, his widow said, and he died shortly after. Prison authorities told his mother Lyudmila that her son had experienced "sudden death syndrome". Later, state investigators said the death had been caused by a medical condition and arrythmia.Navalny's associates have shared previously unseen images on social media purporting to show his cell on the day he died and the tiny exercise yard where he was allowed out.Vladimir Putin, who studiously avoided naming Navalny while he was alive, briefly referred to him a month after his death by stating that a person passing was "always a sad event".The Russian president also said he had agreed to a planned prisoner swap between Navalny and "some people" held in Western jails, on condition that Navalny did not come back to Russia. "But such is life. There's nothing to be done about it," Putin said.It is highly unlikely Moscow will issue any further comment on Navalny's death.His popularity and internet savviness long rattled the Kremlin, while senior figures were irritated by his investigations into high-profile government corruption.With Navalny's death Russia lost the last towering opposition figure who challenged Putin's rule.Many of his associates have been jailed or have fled Russia. Navalnaya herself faces arrest, and she and her two children live abroad.The crackdown on civil society ramped up further following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and punitive new laws leading to mass arrests have muzzled any opposition. In both life and death Navalny managed to draw out huge crowds onto the streets. Thousands of mourners turned out for his funeral in Moscow in March 2024 despite well-founded fears of a police crackdown. No large opposition gatherings have taken place in Russia since.Navalny’s life in 'Polar Wolf' remote penal colonyNavalny's grieving widow vows to continue his workNavalny was often asked: 'Do you fear for your life?'RussiaAlexei NavalnyVladimir PutinRelatedTrump urges Turkey to stop buying Russian oil as Erdogan chases deal on F-35sWoman in Spanish cold case identified after 20 yearsThe sun sets on India's iconic and controversial Soviet fighter jetMore from the BBC1 day agoRosenberg: Russia brushes off Trump's claim of 'paper tiger' in aimless warThe BBC's Steve Rosenberg says far from being riled by Trump's comments, Russia's response has so far been restrained.1 day ago5 days agoBBC's Steve Rosenberg attends 'Russia's answer to Eurovision' Vietnam was among 23 countries competing in a glitzy Russian song contest, revived three years after Russia was banned from Eurovision.5 days ago6 days agoRussia's answer to Eurovision is less kitsch, more KremlinPutin resurrects a Soviet-era global song contest, to distract from Russia's invasion of Ukraine.6 days ago16 Sep 2025Beaten and held in Russia for three years - but never charged with a crimeRussia imprisoned Dmytro shortly after its invasion of Ukraine in 2022.
