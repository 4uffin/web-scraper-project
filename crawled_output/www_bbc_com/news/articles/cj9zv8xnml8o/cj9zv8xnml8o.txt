On 20 June, the judge ruled Mr Khalil must be released. While detained, Mr Khalil's wife, a US citizen, gave birth to their son.In March, the US government also accused Mr Khalil of leaving out details of his previous associations on immigration documentation, including membership of Unwra - the UN agency that works with Palestinians - and "continuing employment" at the British Embassy in Beirut.Responding to the recent decision, Mr Khalil added: "When their first effort to deport me was set to fail, they resorted to fabricating baseless and ridiculous allegations in a bid to silence me for speaking out and standing firmly with Palestine, demanding an end to the ongoing genocide."In June, Mr Khalil's lawyers filed a claim for $20m (£14.7m) in damages alleging false imprisonment, malicious prosecution and being smeared as an antisemite.Trump has repeatedly alleged that pro-Palestinian activists, including Mr Khalil, support Hamas, a group designated a terrorist organisation by the US. The president argues these protesters should be deported and called Mr Khalil's arrest "the first of many to come".Mr Khalil's role in Columbia's 2024 protests placed him in the public eye. On the front lines of negotiations, he played a role in mediating between university officials and the activists and students who attended the protests.Activists supporting Israel have accused Mr Khalil of being a leader of Columbia University Apartheid Divest (Cuad), a student group that demanded, among other things, the university to divest from its financial ties to Israel and a ceasefire in Gaza.Mr Khalil has denied that he led the group, telling the Associated Press (AP) that he only served as a spokesperson for protesters and as a mediator with the university.Who is Mahmoud Khalil, Palestinian student activist facing US deportation?Mahmoud Khalil files $20m claim against Trump administrationIsrael-Gaza warDonald TrumpUnited StatesRelatedBBC and news agencies launch film calling on Israel to allow foreign journalists into GazaIsraeli strikes kill dozens in Gaza City, hospitals say, as offensive expandsTwenty injured in Yemen drone attack on Israel, rescuers and military sayMore from the BBCJust nowAmerica's blame game over Canada's wildfire smoke misses the point, experts sayUS officials have blamed Canada for not doing enough to stop its wildfire smoke from wafting south.
