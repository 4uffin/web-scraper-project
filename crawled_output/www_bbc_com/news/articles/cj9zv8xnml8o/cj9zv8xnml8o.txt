On 20 June, the judge ruled Mr Khalil must be released. While detained, Mr Khalil's wife, a US citizen, gave birth to their son.In March, the US government also accused Mr Khalil of leaving out details of his previous associations on immigration documentation, including membership of Unwra - the UN agency that works with Palestinians - and "continuing employment" at the British Embassy in Beirut.Responding to the recent decision, Mr Khalil added: "When their first effort to deport me was set to fail, they resorted to fabricating baseless and ridiculous allegations in a bid to silence me for speaking out and standing firmly with Palestine, demanding an end to the ongoing genocide."In June, Mr Khalil's lawyers filed a claim for $20m (£14.7m) in damages alleging false imprisonment, malicious prosecution and being smeared as an antisemite.Trump has repeatedly alleged that pro-Palestinian activists, including Mr Khalil, support Hamas, a group designated a terrorist organisation by the US. The president argues these protesters should be deported and called Mr Khalil's arrest "the first of many to come".Mr Khalil's role in Columbia's 2024 protests placed him in the public eye. On the front lines of negotiations, he played a role in mediating between university officials and the activists and students who attended the protests.Activists supporting Israel have accused Mr Khalil of being a leader of Columbia University Apartheid Divest (Cuad), a student group that demanded, among other things, the university to divest from its financial ties to Israel and a ceasefire in Gaza.Mr Khalil has denied that he led the group, telling the Associated Press (AP) that he only served as a spokesperson for protesters and as a mediator with the university.Who is Mahmoud Khalil, Palestinian student activist facing US deportation?Mahmoud Khalil files $20m claim against Trump administrationIsrael-Gaza warDonald TrumpUnited StatesRelatedTaoiseach criticises presidential candidate for 'justifying' HamasFrance formally recognises Palestinian state Footage shows public executions in Gaza City streetMore from the BBC14 mins agoTrump designates Antifa a 'domestic terrorist organisation'Trump signed an executive order as part of his crackdown on the "radical left" after the assassination of Charlie Kirk.14 mins ago26 mins agoWhat is Antifa and why is President Trump targeting it?President Trump has signed an executive order designating Antifa as a domestic terror group, but legal experts have questioned how this will work. 26 mins ago52 mins agoUS Supreme Court to revisit laws curtailing Trump's power to fire top officialsThe ruling allows the president to remove the sole Democratic official on the Federal Trade Commission, an independent body set up by Congress.52 mins ago2 hrs agoTrump urges pregnant women to avoid Tylenol over unproven autism linkSome studies have suggested an association between the two, but experts say there is no causal relationship. 2 hrs ago5 hrs agoWhite House denies border tsar Tom Homan accepted $50,000 bribeThe White House says FBI agents under the last administration had tried to "entrap" Homan.5 hrs agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
