While the latter helps distribute government funding, the day-to-day operations of the centre were controlled by a volunteer committee, made up of parents and community members.That committee was gutted last month when a dispute led to the mass resignation of its president, vice-president and secretary, leaving its treasurer Thomas D'Souza to take over the helm, according to the Brisbane Times. The new management fired existing staff and hired temporary workers, leading many parents to remove their kids from the centre, their report said.Parents lodged complaints about Mr D'Souza being the sole committee member, something he denied, prompting C&K to pause funding as authorities investigated the way the centre was being run.Nine/A Current AffairThe centre is about half an hour north of Brisbane On Sunday night, the inboxes of the families with children at the kindergarten pinged with an email from management wanting to address a "tumultuous" few weeks."It is our turn to talk," the email said, according to the A Current Affair programme on the Nine network.The lengthy missive said the centre couldn't pay its debts and had entered voluntary administration.Hours later, another message landed, revealing a plan to sell the children's art portfolios for thousands a pop, and asking any parents opposed to that to email back.The request left Brooke, one of the parents at the centre, speechless. "It's ridiculous, absolutely ridiculous. I don't even really have words for it," she told A Current Affair.She added that when she decided to take the artwork without paying, the centre reported her to police.Though it is unclear whether they are referencing the same incident, Queensland Police told the BBC it had received reports of an alleged midnight break-and-enter at the kindergarten about a fortnight ago, and was investigating. The kindergarten management did not respond to the BBC's request for comment.But the saga has prompted public backlash, with thousands weighing in on social media and the state's premier blasting the request as "un-Australian" and "wrong on so many levels"."I never saw any Picassos come home, that's for sure. But they mean something to you," David Crisafulli said of his own kids' early crafts, on the BBC's Today programme."Let's give the kids their finger painting and let's get on with life."Getty ImagesQueensland premier David Crisafulli is among those who criticised the requestA spokesperson for the Department of Education also sought to assure parents on Wednesday that they had a legal right to their children's works."Under the Education and Care Services National Regulations, parents can request certain documentation pertaining to their child. The approved provider must make the documentation available on request," they said.Later on Wednesday, the Department of Education and C&K confirmed they had launched a successful recovery operation, and had retrieved the children's collections from the kindergarten."C&K recognises the importance of these portfolios and unequivocally condemns any practice that involves charging parents for their children's portfolios," a C&K spokeswoman told the BBC in statement."These important records are now available for families to collect."For these parents, their children's art is now both priceless and free.QueenslandAustraliaRelatedFather tried to save son before Australia drowningHow Peter Dutton's heartland lost him Australia's electionJury discharged in high-profile Australia beach murderMore from the BBC17 hrs agoGaza City medics describe hospital overwhelmed by casualties from Israeli strikesAustralian doctors say they are having to operate in filthy conditions with few or no anaesthetics.17 hrs ago22 hrs agoAustralia journalist unfairly fired over Gaza post awarded A$150,000Australia's public broadcaster "sacrificed" Antoinette Lattouf "to appease a lobby group", the judge said.22 hrs ago1 day agoThe Ashes: England in Australia 2025-26Fixtures for the 2025-26 men's Ashes series between Australia and England in Australia, featuring five Tests.1 day ago2 days agoSydney 'Night Stalker' pleads guilty to string of sexual assaults in 90sPolice arrested the 61-year-old after a breakthrough in DNA and fingerprint technologies.2 days ago2 days agoPolice officer charged with assault at pro-Palestinian protest in SydneyHannah Thomas says she was punched in the eye during a scuffle with police in June.2 days agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
