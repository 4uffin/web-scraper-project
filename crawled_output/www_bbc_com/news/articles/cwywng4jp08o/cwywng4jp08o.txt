The UK's Ministry of Defence has previously said it is co-operating with the Kenyan investigation into the case, which has caused outrage in the East African nation.The family of Ms Wanjiru, who left behind a young daughter, have long been fighting for justice.They live in Nanyuki, which is close to the British Army Training Unit Kenya (Batuk) - some 200km (125 miles) north of the capital, Nairobi.Ms Wanjiru's niece, Esther Njoki, told the BBC that the warrant was "a bitter-sweet moment", noting the extradition process could take time. The prosecution told the court that witnesses currently based in the UK would be made available for the trial, ensuring that it could proceed.The family's UK-based legal representative, Tessa Gregory, said it now called "upon the British government to do everything in its power to ensure that the accused can be extradited and face trial in Kenya as soon as possible".Agnes Wanjiru murder: Kenya family's anger over UK army 'cover-up'Kenyans sue the British army over fire at wildlife sanctuaryGetty Images/BBCGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.Follow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafricaBBC Africa podcastsFocus on AfricaThis Is AfricaKenyaAfricaRelatedShock as Kenyan lawyer killed in drive-by shooting in Nairobi'I fear for my sons': Mother awaits DNA results on remains linked to Kenya's starvation cultTourist pouring beer down elephant's trunk in Kenya sparks angerMore from the BBC16 hrs agoTrucks set ablaze as militants block key Senegal-Mali trade routeIslamists fighters are trying to prevent deliveries of fuel and other essential supplies to landlocked Mali.16 hrs ago18 hrs agoGunmen kill 22 after shooting at baptism ceremony in Niger - reportsNiger's army has failed to contain the jihadist insurgency, with dozens killed in recent attacks.18 hrs ago1 day ago'The hungry can't stay silent' - behind deadly protests in oil-rich AngolaAs the 50th independence anniversary approaches the country grapples with poverty and inequality.1 day ago1 day agoChinese-linked mining firms sued over 'ecological catastrophe' in ZambiaMillion of litres of highly acidic waste spilled into rivers in a copper-mining area, farmers say. 1 day ago2 days agoFears balloon of a return to civil war in South Sudan over treason trialThe political rift that could spiral into conflict again after the vice-president was accused of treason.2 days agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
