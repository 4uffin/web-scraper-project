The UK's Ministry of Defence has previously said it is co-operating with the Kenyan investigation into the case, which has caused outrage in the East African nation.The family of Ms Wanjiru, who left behind a young daughter, have long been fighting for justice.They live in Nanyuki, which is close to the British Army Training Unit Kenya (Batuk) - some 200km (125 miles) north of the capital, Nairobi.Ms Wanjiru's niece, Esther Njoki, told the BBC that the warrant was "a bitter-sweet moment", noting the extradition process could take time. The prosecution told the court that witnesses currently based in the UK would be made available for the trial, ensuring that it could proceed.The family's UK-based legal representative, Tessa Gregory, said it now called "upon the British government to do everything in its power to ensure that the accused can be extradited and face trial in Kenya as soon as possible".Agnes Wanjiru murder: Kenya family's anger over UK army 'cover-up'Kenyans sue the British army over fire at wildlife sanctuaryGetty Images/BBCGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.Follow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafricaBBC Africa podcastsFocus on AfricaThis Is AfricaKenyaAfricaRelated'I'm Kenyan, don't shoot' - the athlete who says he was duped into the Russian armyMurdered Kenyan's friends want UK soldier to face justiceShock as Kenyan lawyer killed in drive-by shooting in NairobiMore from the BBC2 hrs agoEswatini says it has repatriated US deportee to JamaicaOrville Isaac Etoria had been held in prison in the southern African state after Trump's government expelled him.2 hrs ago4 hrs agoMalawi ex-president takes clear lead in vote-count, results showPeter Mutharika has got about 66% of the votes counted so far, putting him ahead of President Lazarus Chakwera.4 hrs ago6 hrs agoThree West African countries to quit International Criminal CourtThe three military juntas, who came to power through coups, say the judicial body is 'incapable' of handling 'proven war crimes'.6 hrs ago1 day agoBotswana declares public holiday after 'historic' athletics gold medalPresident Duma Boko congratulates the men's 4x400m relay team for winning gold at the World Athletic Championships.1 day ago3 days agoMalawi police arrest eight for alleged election fraudOfficials are on high alert after the 2019 presidential election result was annulled due to vote tampering.3 days agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
