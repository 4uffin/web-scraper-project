The UK's Ministry of Defence has previously said it is co-operating with the Kenyan investigation into the case, which has caused outrage in the East African nation.The family of Ms Wanjiru, who left behind a young daughter, have long been fighting for justice.They live in Nanyuki, which is close to the British Army Training Unit Kenya (Batuk) - some 200km (125 miles) north of the capital, Nairobi.Ms Wanjiru's niece, Esther Njoki, told the BBC that the warrant was "a bitter-sweet moment", noting the extradition process could take time. The prosecution told the court that witnesses currently based in the UK would be made available for the trial, ensuring that it could proceed.The family's UK-based legal representative, Tessa Gregory, said it now called "upon the British government to do everything in its power to ensure that the accused can be extradited and face trial in Kenya as soon as possible".Agnes Wanjiru murder: Kenya family's anger over UK army 'cover-up'Kenyans sue the British army over fire at wildlife sanctuaryGetty Images/BBCGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.Follow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafricaBBC Africa podcastsFocus on AfricaThis Is AfricaKenyaAfricaRelated'I'm Kenyan, don't shoot' - the athlete who says he was duped into the Russian armyMurdered Kenyan's friends want UK soldier to face justiceShock as Kenyan lawyer killed in drive-by shooting in NairobiMore from the BBC5 hrs agoMalawi's ex-president wins election in comeback at age 85Peter Mutharika defeated the incumbent, Lazarus Chakwera, the election commission announces.5 hrs ago8 hrs agoSomalia's president: They tried to kill me five timesSomalia's President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud says he is a prime target of the Islamist group al-Shabab. 8 hrs ago9 hrs agoWhy Kordofan is key in Sudan's civil warThe battle for Kordofan, with a population of eight million, is the latest frontline in Sudan's civil war.9 hrs ago11 hrs agoLandmark deal paves way for cheaper HIV protection jabThe drug - a twice-yearly injection – reduces the current HIV treatment cost in developing countries. 11 hrs ago12 hrs agoThe professor who beat fraud allegations to become Malawi's president…againThe president-elect of the southern African nation has a long and controversial political career.12 hrs agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
