France and Saudi Arabia are hosting a one-day summit at the UN General Assembly
focused on plans for a two-state solution to the conflict. G7 states Germany, Italy, and the US did not attend. Belgium, Luxembourg, Malta, Andorra and San Marino are also due to recognise a Palestinian state, after the UK, Canada, Australia and Portugal announced recognition on Sunday. International pressure is ramping up on Israel over the unfolding humanitarian crisis in Gaza and settlement building in the West Bank.Israel has said recognition would reward Hamas for the Palestinian armed group's 7 October 2023 attack on southern Israel in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage.More than 65,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israel since, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. Israeli forces are currently carrying out a ground offensive aimed at taking control of Gaza City, where a million people were living and a famine was confirmed last month.The French leader told the conference that the time had come to stop the war and free the remaining Israeli hostages held by Hamas. He warned against the "peril of endless wars" and said "right must always prevail over might".The international community had failed to build a just and lasting peace in the Middle East, he said, adding that "we must do everything in our power to preserve the possibility of a two-state solution" that would see "Israel and Palestine side by side in peace and security".Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud also addressed the UN, on behalf of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.He reiterated that a two-state solution was the only way to achieve lasting peace in the region.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the EU would set up a new financial instrument to work on Gaza's reconstruction."We must all do more," she told the UN General Assembly. "This is why we will set up a Palestine Donor Group." UN secretary general Antonio Guterres referred to the situation in Gaza as "morally, legally and politically intolerable" and said a two-state solution was the "only credible path" for peace between Israelis and Palestinians. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas - who was blocked from attending the UN General Assembly in person after the US revoked his and other Palestinian officials' visas - addressed the conference via videolink.He called for a permanent ceasefire and said Hamas could have no role in governing Gaza, calling for the group to "surrender their weapons" to the Palestinian Authority (PA)."What we want is one unified state without weapons," he said.Abbas also condemned Hamas's 7 October 2023 attack on southern Israel and addressed Israelis, saying: "Our future and yours depends on peace. Enough violence and war."UK says Israel must not retaliate against Palestinian statehood pushRecognising Palestinian statehood opens another question - who would lead it?What does recognising a Palestinian state mean?ReutersIsrael has been bombarding Gaza City as its forces push deeper into the cityMacron said France was ready to contribute to a "stabilisation mission" in Gaza and called for a transitional administration involving the PA that would oversee the dismantling of Hamas.He said France would only open an embassy to a Palestinian state when all the hostages being held by Hamas are released and a ceasefire had been agreed.Israel's ambassador to the UN, Danny Dannon, spoke to reporters shortly before Macron's announcement. Dannon said a two-state solution was taken "off the table" after the 7 October attack and called this week's talks at the UN a "charade".
He also refused to rule out Israel annexing the occupied West Bank. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted there will be no Palestinian state to the west of the River Jordan, and President Isaac Herzog said recognising one would only "embolden the forces of darkness".Ahead of Macron's announcement, the Palestinian and Israeli flags were displayed on the Eiffel Tower on Sunday night. A number of town halls in France also flew Palestinian flags on Monday, despite a government order to local prefects to maintain neutrality.Pro-Palestinian protests also took place in some 80 towns and cities across Italy, where Giorgia Meloni's government said recently it could be "counter-productive" to recognise a state that did not exist.In Germany, the government has said Palestinian statehood is not currently up for debate, and Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul explained as he left for New York on Monday that, "For Germany, recognition of a Palestinian state comes more at the end of the process. But this process must begin now".Israel & the PalestiniansIsrael-Gaza warIsraelFrancePalestinian territoriesEmmanuel MacronUnited NationsHamasWest BankRelatedHow the simmering row over freedom of speech reached boiling pointFootage shows public executions in Gaza City streetUK says Israel must not retaliate against Palestinian statehood pushMore from the BBC4 hrs agoTaoiseach criticises presidential candidate for 'justifying' HamasThe candidate says Hamas is "part of the fabric of the Palestinian people" and it is "not up to" Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer to decide.4 hrs ago8 hrs agoClashes break out as Italians strike demanding action over GazaTens of thousands turn out and tensions erupt around Milan's main station where 60 police are reported hurt.8 hrs ago9 hrs ago'Don't sell your soul' to sip champagne with Trump, says O'NeillO'Neill did not attend a state banquet with President Trump but Little-Pengelly was among the guests.9 hrs ago11 hrs agoFrance transfixed by murder trial without a bodyCédric Jubillar has always denied killing his wife Delphine, who vanished in December 2020. 11 hrs ago17 hrs agoWhat does recognising a Palestinian state mean?The UK, Australia and Canada have recognised a Palestinian state, while France and other countries are set to do so in the coming days.17 hrs agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
