President Lazarus Chakwera is vying for a second term, his main rival being Peter Mutharika, an octogenarian who has previously been in office.In the cities, campaigning has been overshadowed by fuel shortages, which have led to long, frustrating queues at petrol stations. The rising cost of living has also been a major concern of voters.Vote counting has begun and a presidential run-off will be held if no candidate gets more than 50% of the votes cast in Tuesday's election.When will we know the result?The electoral commission has up until the end of 24 September to announce the presidential result in Tuesday's poll and the end of 30 September for the parliamentary election.But the results could be announced before those dates.What have Malawians been voting for?The 7.2 million people registered to vote in three elections:Presidential - there are 17 candidates to choose fromParliamentary - 229 constituency MPs will be electedLocal -

beforeAmong the 17 hopefuls there are two clear front-runners. Chakwera and Mutharika have squared off against each other at the polls for the fourth time - though the third time ended up not counting. Mutharika first defeated Chakwera in 2014, but when he was declared winner over Chakwera in the next election in 2019 the result was annulled. Chakwera won the re-run the following year.Lazarus Chakwera - Malawi Congress Party (MCP)Chakwera, a former theology lecturer and preacher, had no political experience when he emerged as leader of the MCP in 2013.When he ran for president in 2014 he was unsuccessful, but in 2020 he triumphed, beating the incumbent, Mutharika, in that unprecedented re-run.Chakwera's time in office has been marred by economic turmoil and allegations of corruption. The 70-year-old did, however, reintroduce train services in Malawi for the first time in over three decades. He has also overseen major road construction across the country.Peter Mutharika - Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)Mutharika, an 85-year-old former lawyer and law lecturer, led Malawi from 2014 to 2020.He is the brother of the late President Bingu wa Mutharika, who died in office in 2012. Like Chakwera, Mutharika is also burdened by corruption allegations and links to economic crises. However, his supporters would argue that the current high inflation rate (around 27%) is proof that Mutharika managed the economy better than his successor.Mutharika's age may count against him this election - speculation about his health is rife, especially as he has rarely been seen out in public during the campaign period.Other contenders garnering attention are former president Joyce Banda (People's Party), current Vice-President Michael Usi (Odya Zake Alibe Mlandu) and former reserve bank governor Dalitso Kabambe (UTM).What are the key issues for voters?Polls closed in most areas at 16:00 local time (14:00 GMT)The economyMalawi has long been one of the poorest countries in the world, but the past few years have been especially punishing.The country was devastated by Cyclone Freddy that killed hundreds of people in 2023, then a drought swept across southern Africa the following year. Food prices skyrocketed due to a short supply of crops, pushing many Malawians into extreme poverty.Economists also put Malawi's current inflation problems partly down to the shortage of foreign currencies - known as "forex" - in the banks.In addition, Malawi has been forced to devalue its currency and was recently crippled by fuel shortages and nationwide power outages.CorruptionWhen Chakwera came to power, he vowed to "to clear the rubble of corruption" that has long plagued Malawian politics. His administration says it has excelled in this area, but critics - including the influential Catholic Church - say this is not the case.Scepticism was sparked last year when the director of public prosecutions dropped corruption charges against high-profile figures. Additionally, the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) has been without a director since former boss Martha Chizuma left more than a year ago.To some, the failure to appoint a new head actively hinders the fight against corruption.Previous administrations have also been dogged by graft allegations. For instance, the ACB accused Mutharika of receiving a kickback from a contract to supply food to the police - he denied any wrongdoing.Banda's reputation was dented by a scandal dubbed "cashgate" which happened under her watch. She was cleared by the ACB of any wrongdoing.The former vice-president's deathIn June last year, Vice-President Saulos Chilima died in a plane crash. Popular with the youth, Chilima led the UTM party and could have been a key contender in the upcoming elections, especially as he had fallen out with the president.Although two investigations - one carried out by Germany's aviation accidents agency and another by a Malawi government-appointed commission - did not find evidence of foul play, some Malawians remain suspicious of the authorities. Opposition parties have been fuelling this scepticism during their campaigns, referring to Chakwera's party as the "Chikangawa Party" (Chikangawa Forest being the site of the plane crash).Where the petrol queue might overshadow the queue to voteAFP via Getty ImagesHundreds in Malawi lost their lives to Cyclone FreddyWhat has happened in previous elections?Malawi was governed by the MCP from its independence in 1964 until the country's first multi-party poll in 1994.Since the shift from a one-party state, the United Democratic Front, the DPP, the People's Party and the MCP have all enjoyed stints in power.Chakwera's victory with the MCP in 2020 was one of the most significant moments in the country's political history.A general election had taken place the year before and Mutharika was declared the winner. However, the Constitutional Court annulled the election, saying there had been widespread tampering, including the use of Tipp-Ex correction fluid on results sheets.Judges ordered a re-run for 2020, and Chakwera won with 59% of the vote after having teamed up with Chilima.Although Mutharika branded the re-run "unacceptable", the Constitutional Court gained international acclaim for safeguarding democracy and refusing to be influenced by presidential power.How does the presidential vote work?Following the controversy of the 2019 election, Malawi implemented a new system, where a candidate must gain more than 50% of the total votes to win the presidency in the first round.There is a strong possibility that this year's candidates will not reach the threshold, meaning a run-off election will have to be held.The MCP and DPP will likely try to bring smaller parties on board in order to secure a majority in the second round.Will the elections be free and fair?The court's actions following the 2019 vote have given some Malawians faith in the electoral process.However, over the past months, a number or civil society organisations and opposition parties have accused the electoral commission of favouring the MCP, alleging that its top management has links to the governing party. The commission has firmly denied being biased.A protest in June calling for the resignation of the commission's top officials was attacked by masked, machete-wielding men, leading to concerns about freedom of expression in the run-up to the election.The assault was not an isolated incident - there have been numerous reports of politically motivated violence ahead of the general election.More BBC stories about Malawi:How brave judges rejected a 'second-rate election''Magnetic' Malawian vice-president dies in plane crash'I tell my children not to play so we save money on soap'Banana wine brings sweet taste of success to Malawi farmersHigh hopes of Malawi cannabis farmers are dashedGetty Images/BBCGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.Follow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafricaBBC Africa podcastsFocus on AfricaThis Is AfricaMalawiAfricaRelatedMalawi's parties warned not to prematurely declare election victoryMalawians await presidential poll result in vote dominated by economic woesMalawi - where the petrol queue might overshadow the queue to voteMore from the BBC7 hrs agoUS deportees sue Ghana over 'illegal' detentionDespite opposition to the deal, Ghana's president says 40 more deportees will arrive from the US.7 hrs ago14 hrs agoTogo leader's sister-in-law arrested after calling for end to family ruleMarguerite Gnakadé has become a vocal critic of Togo's long-serving leader Faure Gnassingbé.14 hrs ago20 hrs agoNew project to fight 'devastating' disease beginsThe University of Surrey says it is tackling schistosomiasis, a major public health issue. 20 hrs ago2 days agoTrucks set ablaze as militants block key Senegal-Mali trade routeIslamists fighters are trying to prevent deliveries of fuel and other essential supplies to landlocked Mali.2 days ago2 days agoGunmen kill 22 after shooting at baptism ceremony in Niger - reportsNiger's army has failed to contain the jihadist insurgency, with dozens killed in recent attacks.2 days agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
