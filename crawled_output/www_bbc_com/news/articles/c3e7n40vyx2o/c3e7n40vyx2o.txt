As the song evokes memories, his wife Kate quietly adds "the fight was worth it."Watch Dave and Kate tell their story on Morning LiveKate Gilmore/BBC Morning LiveDave is curating a playlist of songs from throughout his life to carry him through terminal illnessMoments like this emphasise the power of music to forge everlasting connection.Its therapeutic benefits are increasingly recognised in palliative and end of life care. The impact is neurological as well as emotional, explains Sarah Metcalfe, managing director of the Utley Foundation's Music for Dementia campaign.Brain activity scans show music "lights up" multiple parts of our brain, simultaneously touching physical and emotional sense centres."Even if one part of the brain is damaged, those other parts can still be accessed," Sarah says.Kate GilmoreDave and Kate on their wedding day in 1986UK charity Marie Curie surveyed 1,000 adults whose loved ones had received care in the final stages of life. It found listening to music together helped to create a shared experience that brought them closer, creating a sense of normality and helping them relax.Kate experienced this first hand. When Dave once returned home after a lengthy hospital stay, he was twitchy and exhausted but unable to sleep.Out of desperation she turned to Native American music, one of his favourite genres to relax to.

How to make a good palliative playlist1. Focus on music memories between ages 10-30, which is when the strongest associations are formed2. Include songs connected to special, significant places and important life events - youth, holidays, romance, first dances and wedding songs3. Consider feelings sparked by songs - these can be just as powerful as memory association4. Remember that music can trigger memories even for people with conditions like dementia by connecting multiple brain regions. Use resources like BBC Music Memories to spark memory recall5. Be open to unexpected musical connections, like TV show themes or commercial jingles that might hold special meaningSource: Music for Dementia's managing director, Sarah MetcalfeMarie CurieDiana, a musician in her spare time, says music plays a pivotal role in end-of-life careExperts agree that music can reduce anxiety and psychological pain, even when someone is unconscious.Dr Sam Murphy, senior lecturer at the Open University, specialises in thanatology, the study of death and the practices associated with it."There's certainly evidence to suggest that hearing is the last sense to go so even when someone is unconscious or unresponsive, music can still reach them," she says. "It keeps them connected to their surroundings, to the people they love, and to the sense of being alive and those memories that they've had."An everlasting comfort in deathMusic can be equally helpful to loved ones after a person has passed away. "I think it's just another distraction for those people that are mourning a loved one," Dr Murphy says. "But there's that comfort in knowing that they're listening to something that their loved one would have listened to over the years."This is true for Anna-Kay Brocklesby, whose husband Ian passed away from prostate cancer in 2023.As Ian's health deteriorated, sharing his favourite songs became a crucial part of their family's coping mechanism. It became a way to keep spirits up and stay positive, says his wife."Every morning he would go down and make the tea, he would play. Oh, What a Beautiful Morning from the musical Oklahoma," she says."And he would belt it out. He used it as a sort of mindset of, this is how today's going to be".They would play Frank Sinatra, Nat King Cole, and Elton John songs, which provided comfort and connection.Two years after Ian died, Anna-Kay still finds comfort in the music they shared together."He lives on in us in many, many ways," says Anna-Kay, "but music can take us to a place with Ian".Details of organisations offering information and support for end-of-life care are available at bbc.co.uk/actionlineHealthPalliative careMental healthRelatedTrump urges pregnant women to avoid Tylenol over unproven autism linkNew GPs rule after 27-year-old's cancer missed Plan for patients to be seen by any dentist droppedMore from the BBC14 hrs agoCrisis intervention service closes over lack of fundingFunding for Extern's crisis intervention service in Londonderry ran out in June of this year.14 hrs ago20 hrs ago'My ex-soldier son was struggling and nobody helped'Dawn Turner says her son Robert Homans had struggled to access help with housing and mental health20 hrs ago2 days agoLocal heroes to be honoured at BBC awards nightFinalists in eight categories are up for awards at Canterbury's Malthouse Theatre on Monday. 2 days ago4 days ago'Pilates was like therapy after my son's death'4 days ago5 days agoMarcondes: Baton of Hope is 'a proud moment'The Canaries' midfielder says footballers are getting better at opening up on their mental health.5 days agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
