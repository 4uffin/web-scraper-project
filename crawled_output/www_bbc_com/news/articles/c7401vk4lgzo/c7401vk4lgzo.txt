The incidents comes after the country's Copenhagen airport was forced to close earlier this week due to a drone incursion, which the prime minister described as "the most severe attack on Danish infrastructure so far".Local police said they were investigating the reports, but could not confirm the purpose of the drones or who is controlling them.At least three flights have been diverted from Aalborg airport, with officials saying the Danish Armed Forces were affected as the airport is also used as a military base.The North Jutland Police released a statement saying they were monitoring the situation at Aalborg closely but could not elaborate on how many drones were involved."We cannot yet comment on the purpose of the drones flying in the area, nor can we say anything about who the actor behind it is," chief inspector Jesper Bøjgaard Madsen said."If we get the opportunity, we will take down the drones," he added.Police said they did not believe there is any danger to passengers at the airport or residents, but asked the public to keep their distance from the area. They said the devices could be seen from the ground and added that they couldn't rule out the activity being a prank.Addressing the drone reports in Esbjerg, Sønderborg and Skrydstrup, police said they were "taking the situation seriously", but could not comment on a motive.They added that none of the airports have been closed and there was no danger to the public.Of the three flights affected at Aalborg, two were sent back to Copenhagen, and another back to the town of Karup.The agency that oversees European air traffic control said arrivals and departures at the airport would be stopped until 06:00 local time (04:00 GMT) on Thursday.On Monday, Kastrup airport in Copenhagen was forced to shut for several hours following the sighting of a number of drones."It says something about the times we live in and what we as a society must be prepared to deal with," Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen told reporters.Russian involvement could not be ruled out, he added - although Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called the allegations "unfounded".Europe has been on high alert after several Nato member states reported Russian drone incursions in their airspaces. Last week, Estonia and Poland requested a consultation with other Nato members, after Russia violated its airspace in separate incidents.Romania, another Nato member, also said Russian drones breached its airspace.Russia denied violating Estonia's airspace, while it insisted the Polish incursion was not deliberate. It did not comment on the Romania incident.After meeting on Tuesday, Nato issued a statement condemning Russia's actions and warned that it would use "all necessary military and non-military tools" to defend itself."Russia bears full responsibility for these actions, which are escalatory, risk miscalculation and endanger lives. They must stop," it said.Nato's secretary general Mark Rutte said: "We are a defensive alliance, yes, but we are not naive, so we see what is happening."After his speech to the UN, Donald Trump suggested that Nato nations should shoot down Russian planes breaching their airspace.Russia's involvement in drone sightings cannot be ruled out, Danish PM saysRussia will expand aggression beyond Ukraine if not stopped, Zelensky warns Kyiv can win all of Ukraine back from Russia, Trump saysDenmarkDronesRelatedGreenland contraception scandal victims hear Danish PM's emotional apologyRussia's involvement in drone sightings cannot be ruled out, Danish PM saysCopenhagen and Oslo airports forced to close temporarily due to drone sightingsMore from the BBC7 days agoDrone no-fly zone in place for Tory conferenceDrone restrictions will be in place during next month's Conservative Party Conference in Manchester.7 days ago16 Sep 2025Two arrested for flying drones in restricted airspaceA temporary airspace restriction is in place around Windsor for the visit of President Trump.16 Sep 202516 Sep 2025Defence drone company opens its biggest UK siteThe company says it creates drones which help with surveillance and planning operations.16 Sep 202512 Sep 2025Ukraine strikes key Russian oil terminal in massive drone attackThe overnight attack is the largest since May, but follows much larger bombardments from Russia.12 Sep 202512 Sep 2025'Looks like a toy, but it's real': BBC examines a downed Russian droneDrones like this one were shot down over Polish airspace in the early hours of Wednesday.12 Sep 2025British Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
