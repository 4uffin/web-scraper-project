"I thought that they were slightly incomprehensible comments that were totally inappropriate", the minister said.The tech billionaire also referred to massive uncontrolled migration and called for a change of government in the UK.Met Police officers clash with protesters at Tommy Robinson rallyRobinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, criticised politicians for "parroting" his ideas as he addressed the crowds from a stage.He claimed UK courts had decided the rights of undocumented migrants superseded those of the "local community", referring to the Court of Appeal decision last month to overturn an injunction blocking asylum seekers being housed at The Bell Hotel in Essex.Central London saw a huge policing operation for the protests this weekend, with around 1,000 officers deployed.Assistant Commissioner Matt Twist said officers said: "There is no doubt that many came to exercise their lawful right to protest, but there were many who came intent on violence."The protest was largely peaceful on Saturday lunchtime but as the afternoon continued tensions flared.The Met said some officers had been attacked while trying to keep the two groups apart and dozens of officers were injured, including four who were seriously hurt.Protesters joining the march, organised by Robinson, became too big to fit into Whitehall, police said, and confrontation happened when officers tried to stop them encircling counter-protesters.Mounted police officers used batons to push back the crowds and officers were kicked and punched, said the Met.Three of the 24 people arrested were women and the rest were men, while the youngest and oldest people detained at the protest were aged 19 and 58 respectively, the Met said on Sunday.Several people were arrested for more than one offence.The force added officers were working to identify other people involved in disorder with a view to making further arrests "in the coming days and weeks.The Met said on Saturday morning that they were not going to use live facial recognition cameras during the day.Previously called a "game-changing tool" by Met Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley, the technology is used by the force in "hotspot policing" and major events like the Notting Hill Carnival.Robinson was released from prison earlier this year after being jailed in October for ignoring an order not to repeat false claims about a Syrian refugee, who had successfully sued him for libel.British Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
