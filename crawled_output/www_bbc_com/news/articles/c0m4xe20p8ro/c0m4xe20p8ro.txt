But for most, it remains a distant dream.India only granted citizenship to the first Sri Lankan Tamil in 2022 - K Nalini was born a year before the 1987 law that mandated Indian citizenship of at least one parent. At least 13 more Tamils have been granted citizenship since.Mr Ravindran hopes his case will be taken up soon. He pledges allegiance to India and says he never intends to return to Sri Lanka.He recently told the BBC that he has travelled to the island nation just once in his life – in September 2024 to marry a Sri Lankan woman.He says his troubles began after he applied for a fresh passport to include the name of his spouse this year. Lawyer Sandesh Saravanan, who is representing Mr Ravindran in court, told the BBC that he was given a fresh passport after verification by the police, who were aware of his Sri Lankan parentage.But the Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO), which oversees the registration of foreigners in India, later flagged his parents' origin to the police, he said.Mr Ravindran was arrested last month on charges of cheating, forgery and illegally holding an Indian passport and held in custody for 15 days, before being freed on bail.Fearing further punitive action, he approached the Madras High Court last week, which ordered authorities to not take any coercive action until the next hearing on 8 October."In all these years, no-one ever told me I was not Indian," Mr Ravindran told the BBC."When I was told for the first time that I am a 'stateless person', I could not accept it."And now, Mr Ravindran is pinning his hopes on the court to agree with him.Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and FacebookTamil NaduAsiaRefugees and asylum seekersCitizenshipIndiaSri LankaRelatedWatch: Bear caught on CCTV searching for food in Indian templeHow researchers recreated faces of 2,500-year-old skulls found in IndiaFrom bus conductor to superstar: Rajinikanth completes 50 years in Indian filmsMore from the BBC3 hrs agoThe sun sets on India's iconic and controversial Soviet fighter jetMiG-21 served in all conflicts with Pakistan since 1965 and was later known for a high crash rate.3 hrs ago7 hrs agoIndia beat Bangladesh to reach Asia Cup finalOpener Abhishek Sharma scores a half-century and Kuldeep Yadav takes three wickets as defending champions India beat Bangladesh in Dubai7 hrs ago8 hrs agoEpping protester fined for not removing balaclavaJoshua Meadows also admits to possessing cannabis at a protest about asylum seekers at The Bell Hotel.8 hrs ago8 hrs agoUrgent review ordered into asylum seeker taxi costsAsylum seekers are travelling long distances for appointments, with one telling the BBC his journey to visit a GP cost the Home Office £600.8 hrs ago13 hrs agoWatch: Typhoon Ragasa leaves trail of destruction in ChinaThe "king of storms" has forced the evacuation of nearly two million people from the southern Chinese province of Guangdong.13 hrs agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
