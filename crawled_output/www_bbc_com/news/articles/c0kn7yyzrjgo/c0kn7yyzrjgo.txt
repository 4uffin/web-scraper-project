"Given the Taliban's misogynistic mindset and policies, it is only natural that when women themselves are not allowed to study, their views, ideas and writings are also suppressed."The new guidelines, which have been seen by BBC Afghan, were issued in late August.Ziaur Rahman Aryubi, the deputy academic director of the Taliban government's Ministry of Higher Education, said in a letter to universities that the decisions had been made by a panel of "religious scholars and experts".As well as books by women, the ban appears to have targeted books by Iranian authors or publishers, with one member of the book review panel telling the BBC it was designed to "prevent the infiltration of Iranian content" into the Afghan curriculum".In the 50-page list sent to all universities in Afghanistan, 679 titles appear, 310 of which are either authored by Iranian writers or published in Iran.Two different people, including one on the book review committee, told BBC Afghan that the decision was taken to "prevent the infiltration of Iranian content" through the curriculum.The neighbouring countries do not have an easy relationship, clashing over issues such as water rights in recent years. Iran has also forced more than 1.5m Afghans who had been living in the country back across the border since January amid rising anti-Afghan sentiment.But the decision has worried some lecturers, with a professor at one institution, who spoke on condition of anonymity, saying he feared it would be almost impossible to fill the gap."Books by Iranian authors and translators serve as the primary link between Afghanistan's universities and the global academic community. Their removal creates a substantial void in higher education," he said.A professor at Kabul University told the BBC that under such circumstances, they are forced to prepare textbook chapters themselves, taking into account the do's and don'ts imposed by the Taliban government.But the crucial question is whether these chapters can be prepared according to global standards or not.The BBC has approached the Taliban's Ministry of Education for comment.Hopes fade as Afghan universities reopen without womenAfghanistanWomen's rights in AfghanistanTalibanBooksEducationReligionWomenRelatedAfghan boy flies from Kabul to Delhi hiding in plane's landing gearBritish couple held by Taliban for months feared they would be executedMy three boys starved to death.
