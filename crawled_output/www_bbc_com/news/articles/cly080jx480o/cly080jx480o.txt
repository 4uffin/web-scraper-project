In two days of meetings, Acip changed its recommendations on the combined measles, mumps, rubella, varicella (MMRV) vaccine, and delayed plans for a vote on the hepatitis B vaccine. Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, a vaccine sceptic, fired all 17 members of the committee in June and handpicked their successors, sparking uproar in the medical community.The panel spent Friday debating the Covid-19 vaccine, which has for the past several years been a routine recommendation, like the yearly flu jab.Acip voted to abandon broad support for recommending the jab, including for high-risk populations like people aged over 65.Instead it decided they could make their own decision after talking with a medical professional.In May, the federal government stopped recommending Covid-19 vaccines for healthy pregnant women and children.In one exchange on Friday, Kennedy's ally Dr Robert Malone argued there was no evidence that the Covid vaccine prevented serious infection.Dr Cody Meissner, once part of the Food and Drug Administration's vaccines panel, argued there is "pretty well-defined" data that the jab protects against infection.There was confusion during the debate over the MMRV vaccine - measles, mumps and rubella, and varicella (commonly known as chickenpox).On Thursday, the panel voted against recommending the combined MMRV shot for children aged four and under.But on Friday they decided to endorse two separate jabs - a combined one for measles, mumps and rubella, and another for varicella.The American Medical Association, which represents doctors and medical students, said the new MMRV recommendations "leave parents confused".Getty ImagesUS Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr has cast doubt on the safety and effectiveness of a number of vaccinesThe panel also delayed a vote on whether newborns whose mothers have tested negative for hepatitis B during pregnancy should automatically receive a jab for the liver virus.The Acip has cast doubt on the hepatitis B vaccine for months, even though scientists say it is safe and effective at preventing the infection.In June, the panel's new chairman Dr Martin Kulldorff questioned whether it was "wise" to give the hepatitis B vaccine to newborns.The CDC has advised that children receive the hepatitis B vaccine at birth since 1991.Since then, the number of cases of the potentially fatal disease have decreased among people aged 19 and younger, which experts and the CDC credit to the implementation of the hepatitis B vaccine.Robert F Kennedy Jr's posture on vaccinations has been under scrutiny since he took office in January. Kennedy has overhauled the CDC during his tenure. He replaced the members of the vaccine advisory panel in June, and fired its chief Susan Monarez in late August, provoking a group of senior staff to resign in protest. On Wednesday, Dr Monarez told the Senate she was fired for refusing to sign off on changes to vaccine policy "regardless of the scientific evidence".Earlier this month, Kennedy said he dismissed Dr Monarez because he felt their interactions demonstrated she was not trustworthy.Doctors and health experts have criticised the health secretary's longstanding questioning of the safety and efficacy of a number of vaccines, although in his Senate confirmation hearing he said he was "not going to take them away".Former CDC head says she was fired for refusing Kennedy's vaccine changes'It's just scary': In Florida, parents ponder future with fewer vaccinesWhy the world is watching RFK's fight with US health agencyVaccinationUnited StatesRobert F Kennedy JrRelatedFlu vaccines for children to halt spread of virusPharmacies to offer toddler flu spray vaccinationJersey winter vaccine rollout to begin next weekMore from the BBC5 mins agoFormer FBI director James Comey indicted on two chargesJames Comey says he is innocent after being accused of lying to Congress in 2020 while testifying about leaks to the media.5 mins ago3 hrs agoUS President Gerald Ford's would-be assassin dies at age 95Sara Jane Moore fired two shots at the Republican president during his visit to San Francisco in 1975.
