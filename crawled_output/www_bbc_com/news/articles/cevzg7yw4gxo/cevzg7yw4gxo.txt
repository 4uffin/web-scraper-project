"It was as if needles had penetrated my skin. I felt raw and the pain was agonising."Those of us who ate the same dish suffered the same effects."He said he then began to notice people on other tables showing similar symptoms."We looked around the restaurant and saw other tables in pain and having to get the attention of staff," he said."Rightfully so. People looked really anxious."GoogleThe restaurant has temporarily closed following the incidentMr Jones said visiting Dosa Kingss was supposed to have been "a lovely treat" for his family, but it was not one he wanted to repeat.However, he said he felt "accidents do happen in the realm of food and drink" and was grateful that nobody affected were asked to pay their bill.On researching further at home, he said he discovered yams can contain a harmful toxin in large doses and suspects that could have been a factor."It would be heavy-handed and mean to pursue legal action," he continued."I don't think anyone was trying to put anyone at risk."Dosa Kingss said in a statement posted on Facebook: "Due to unforeseen circumstances, we are temporarily closed."We sincerely apologise for any inconvenience this may cause and truly appreciate your understanding and support. "We look forward to serving you again."Listen to the best of BBC Radio Manchester on Sounds and follow BBC Manchester on Facebook, X, and Instagram.
