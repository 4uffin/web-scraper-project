Their son Jonathan Reynolds told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that he was "ecstatic and massively grateful" to those who were involved in securing their release. The Taliban, who detained the couple on 1 February, said the pair had broken Afghan laws and were released after judicial proceedings - but the Islamist group has never disclosed a reason for their detention.Peter and Barbie Reynolds married in Kabul in 1970 and spent the past 18 years running a charitable training programme that had been approved by local Taliban officials when the armed group reclaimed power in 2021.There were emotional scenes on Friday as the couple's daughter, Sarah Entwistle, met her parents as they stepped off the plane in Doha."We are looking forward to returning to Afghanistan if we can. We are Afghan citizens," Barbie told Agence France-Presse at Kabul airport after Qatar-brokered negotiations for their release.Their son Jonathan echoed those hopes, saying "their desire would be to carry on living there and to do the work they were doing".Watch: Hugs on the tarmac as family reunite in Doha after Afghan ordeal"They have not just a heart for the people of Afghanistan, but they have strategy as well, and the work they've been doing has been very fruitful and has a massively positive impact," Jonathan told the BBC.He said a few weeks ago he had managed to share the results of "really encouraging" reports about their programmes with his parents over the phone. He said Barbie's initial reaction had been that they had "more work to do". "But how do you do that in a country where you're not welcome," Jonathan added.
Since 2009 the couple have been running training projects in Kabul and Bamiyan.One of their education projects involved training women and children, and had apparently been approved by local authorities, despite a Taliban ban on women working and education for girls over 12-years-old.ReutersTheir affection for Afghanistan was demonstrated by their decision to remain in Bamiyan province after the authoritarian regime seized control in August 2021, while many other Westerners left - including most of their staff.The couple's release follows months of public lobbying by their family, who have described the harrowing conditions of their detention.Jonathan said in July that his father had been suffering serious convulsions and his mother was "numb" from anaemia and malnutrition.UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer praised the "vital role" played by Qatar in securing their release.A Qatari official told the BBC the couple were moved from Kabul's central prison to a larger facility with better conditions during the final stage of negotiations over their release.The couple received medical checks in Doha before leaving for London. Taliban officials maintained they received adequate medical care during their detention and that their human rights were respected.The UK does not recognise the Taliban government and closed its embassy in Kabul when the group returned to power.The Foreign Office says support for British nationals in Afghanistan is therefore "severely limited" and advises against all travel to the country.More on this storyBritish couple reunited with daughter after months held by TalibanWoman held by Taliban warns British couple 'dying' in prisonBritish couple in their 70s arrested by TalibanBritish couple held by Taliban 'may die in prison,' son warnsAfghanistanTalibanRelatedAsia Cup 2025British couple reunited with daughter after months held by TalibanWatch: Hugs on tarmac as family reunite after Afghan ordealMore from the BBC2 days agoTaliban official dismisses Trump's hope to 'take back' Afghan airbaseBagram airbase was handed over to the Afghan military shortly before the Taliban returned to power.2 days ago2 days agoTaliban ban books written by women from Afghan universitiesThe decree also outlaws the teaching of 18 subjects, including human rights and sexual harassment.2 days ago8 days agoWoman held by Taliban warns British couple 'dying' in prisonFaye Hall was arrested with Peter and Barbie Reynolds in February, and released after two months.8 days ago12 Sep 2025Lyra McKee award 'motivation' for journalists around the worldSalma Niazi said it is important people around the world know Lyra's name. 12 Sep 20253 Sep 2025They're eligible for asylum in Canada.
