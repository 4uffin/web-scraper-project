The public address systems were not functioning and there was inadequate signage, this worsened the confusion"."The building was designed with sealed windows. The facility and building managers also inhaled smoke and passed out during the incident leaving no incident manager or safety warden in charge," the statement added.Lasema said it extinguished the fire after a couple of hours, but thick, black smoke travelled throughout the building.Nigeria's President Bola Tinubu described the incident as unfortunate and commiserated with families of the deceased victims.The Nigeria Federal Fire Service said it has launched an investigation to establish the causes of the incident, including the state of safety systems, maintenance practices and compliance with fire safety regulations. The findings will be made public, and all recommendations will be implemented, the service added.NigeriaAfricaRelatedNigerian chef breaks world record for largest jollof rice dishPot breaks as Nigerian chef attempts to cook largest jollof rice dishNigerian pilot tests positive for alcohol after plane veered off runwayMore from the BBC5 hrs agoWhy a tiny island's fate could decide Seychelles' next presidentIndia, Qatari royals, China and ecologists have their own, very different, views on Assumption Island's future.5 hrs ago17 hrs agoFrench navy seizes nearly 10 tonnes of cocaine off West African coastFrench authorities say the "remarkable seizure" was found on board a fishing boat following a tip-off.17 hrs ago21 hrs agoMalawi's ex-president wins election in comeback at age 85Peter Mutharika defeated the incumbent, Lazarus Chakwera, the election commission announces.21 hrs ago21 hrs agoThe professor who beat fraud allegations to become Malawi's president…againThe president-elect of the southern African nation has a long and controversial political career.21 hrs ago1 day agoSomalia's president: They tried to kill me five timesSomalia's President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud says he is a prime target of the Islamist group al-Shabab. 1 day agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseSubscription TermsAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
