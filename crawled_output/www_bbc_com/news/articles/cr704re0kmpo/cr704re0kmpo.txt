The public address systems were not functioning and there was inadequate signage, this worsened the confusion"."The building was designed with sealed windows. The facility and building managers also inhaled smoke and passed out during the incident leaving no incident manager or safety warden in charge," the statement added.Lasema said it extinguished the fire after a couple of hours, but thick, black smoke travelled throughout the building.Nigeria's President Bola Tinubu described the incident as unfortunate and commiserated with families of the deceased victims.The Nigeria Federal Fire Service said it has launched an investigation to establish the causes of the incident, including the state of safety systems, maintenance practices and compliance with fire safety regulations. The findings will be made public, and all recommendations will be implemented, the service added.NigeriaAfricaRelatedNigerian chef breaks world record for largest jollof rice dishPot breaks as Nigerian chef attempts to cook largest jollof rice dishNigerian pilot tests positive for alcohol after plane veered off runwayMore from the BBC17 hrs agoMurdered Kenyan's friends want UK soldier to face justiceFriends of the stabbed 21-year-old Kenyan woman recount to the BBC events on the night she went missing.17 hrs ago1 day agoMalawi police arrest eight for alleged election fraudOfficials are on high alert after the 2019 presidential election result was annulled due to vote tampering.1 day ago1 day agoSouth Africa police uncover $20m crystal meth labFive North Americans were arrested after the raid on a farm in the east of the country, officers say.1 day ago2 days ago'I'm Kenyan, don't shoot' - the athlete who says he was duped into the Russian armyEvans Kibet, now being held in Ukraine after surrendering, says he did not know he was signing up.2 days ago2 days agoDrone strike on Sudan mosque kills 78, medic tells BBCLocal activists and residents describe the early morning attack on worshippers.2 days agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
