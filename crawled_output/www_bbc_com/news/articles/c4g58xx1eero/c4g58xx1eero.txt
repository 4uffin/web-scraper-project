They've also been muzzling the company."A spokesperson for The Magnum Ice Cream Company said the firm had been in dialogue with the two founders before Mr Greenfield's decision to leave."We disagree with his perspective and have sought to engage both co-founders in a constructive conversation on how to strengthen Ben & Jerry's powerful values-based position in the world," they said.Ben & Jerry's boss 'ousted over political activism'Ben & Jerry's board calls for Israel ceasefireCommenting on Mr Greenfield's announcement, Anna Macdonald, investment partner at Aubrey Investments, said Ben and Jerry's had "built a brand all about irreverence and activism and advocacy" and that Unilever had agreed to "continue these missions" when it bought the business in 2000.But in recent years, she said, Unilever may have attempted to rein in the company's activism, particularly with regard to Israel and Gaza.Earlier this year, the company accused Unilever of demanding that it stops publicly criticising US President Donald Trump.Ms Macdonald said Mr Greenfield "has moved on because he doesn't want to be associated with what's happening now".In March this year, Ben & Jerry's said its chief executive, David Stever, was being removed by Unilever.The allegation was part of a legal case filed in a US court by Ben & Jerry's that said Unilever violated a merger agreement by trying to silence its "social mission".A Unilever spokesperson said it was "disappointed that the confidentiality of an employee career conversation has been made public".In May, Mr Cohen was arrested during a protest in the US Senate over military aid to Israel and humanitarian conditions in Gaza.Protesters disrupted the hearing while Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr was testifying.Mr Cohen was charged with a misdemeanour offence, while another six demonstrators were also arrested and face a number of more serious charges, US Capitol Police told BBC News.Israel-Gaza warUnileverInternational BusinessRelatedUK formally recognises Palestinian stateUK rewarding Hamas, says mother of freed British-Israeli hostageWatch: Keir Starmer says UK recognises Palestinian stateMore from the BBC1 hr agoGlobal conflicts drive demand for war risk insuranceWars in Ukraine and the Middle East are fuelling take-up of cover against impact and damage.1 hr ago3 days agoElectric aviation awaits a battery breakthroughWith batteries still too heavy, start-up plane makers are exploring hybrid options for new aircraft.3 days ago3 days agoChina is calling a TikTok deal a win.
