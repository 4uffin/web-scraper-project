They've also been muzzling the company."A spokesperson for The Magnum Ice Cream Company said the firm had been in dialogue with the two founders before Mr Greenfield's decision to leave."We disagree with his perspective and have sought to engage both co-founders in a constructive conversation on how to strengthen Ben & Jerry's powerful values-based position in the world," they said.Ben & Jerry's boss 'ousted over political activism'Ben & Jerry's board calls for Israel ceasefireCommenting on Mr Greenfield's announcement, Anna Macdonald, investment partner at Aubrey Investments, said Ben and Jerry's had "built a brand all about irreverence and activism and advocacy" and that Unilever had agreed to "continue these missions" when it bought the business in 2000.But in recent years, she said, Unilever may have attempted to rein in the company's activism, particularly with regard to Israel and Gaza.Earlier this year, the company accused Unilever of demanding that it stops publicly criticising US President Donald Trump.Ms Macdonald said Mr Greenfield "has moved on because he doesn't want to be associated with what's happening now".In March this year, Ben & Jerry's said its chief executive, David Stever, was being removed by Unilever.The allegation was part of a legal case filed in a US court by Ben & Jerry's that said Unilever violated a merger agreement by trying to silence its "social mission".A Unilever spokesperson said it was "disappointed that the confidentiality of an employee career conversation has been made public".In May, Mr Cohen was arrested during a protest in the US Senate over military aid to Israel and humanitarian conditions in Gaza.Protesters disrupted the hearing while Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr was testifying.Mr Cohen was charged with a misdemeanour offence, while another six demonstrators were also arrested and face a number of more serious charges, US Capitol Police told BBC News.Israel-Gaza warUnileverInternational BusinessRelatedBBC and news agencies launch film calling on Israel to allow foreign journalists into GazaIsraeli strikes kill dozens in Gaza City, hospitals say, as offensive expandsTwenty injured in Yemen drone attack on Israel, rescuers and military sayMore from the BBC20 hrs agoBoss jailed for 15 years over deadly fire at S Korea battery plantA blaze last year killed 23 people at an Aricell factory in Hwaseong city, about 45km south of Seoul.20 hrs ago23 hrs agoTikTok child data protection inadequate, Canadian privacy officials sayTikTok says it will introduce measures to "strengthen our platform" although it disputes some of the findings.23 hrs ago2 days agoPorsche shares plunge after announcing EV rollout delayEuropean carmakers face intense competition from Chinese rivals and weak demand for luxury cars.2 days ago2 days agoWhat's the big deal about AI data centres?Huge investment is going into data centres for AI, but why are they so expensive?2 days ago3 days agoOutdoor brand Arc'teryx apologises for 'dragon' fireworks in HimalayasOfficials are investigating the firm after the display drew backlash for its potential environmental impact.3 days agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
