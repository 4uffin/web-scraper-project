"Pay attention. Get off the iPad," was the stern message issued to the Spirit pilot as the aircraft flew eight miles (12.8km) parallel to Air Force One, the US president's official plane, over New York on Tuesday.The planes were never within a distance that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) would classify as unsafe, but it was close enough to alarm officials."Safety is always our top priority," a Spirit spokesman told CBS, the BBC's US
partner.Spirit Flight 1300 "followed procedures and Air Traffic Control instructions" and "landed uneventfully" as planned in Boston, the airline said.The Spirit flight was travelling from Florida to Massachusetts. According to flight tracking site Flightradar24, the two planes were flying parallel to each other 8 miles apart, and were on paths on which they could have converged 11 miles apart,The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
"Preliminary investigation shows aircraft maintained the required separation." Air traffic control audio obtained by the BBC recorded controllers urgently and repeatedly telling the Spirit Airbus A321 to keep its distance. "Spirit 1300 turn 20 degrees right," an air traffic controller said, according to LiveATC audio. "Pay attention, Spirit 1300 turn 20 degrees right. Spirit 1300 turn 20 degrees right, now.
Spirit wings 1300 turn 20 degrees right, immediately."The budget airline pilots acknowledged the transmission, although their responses were difficult to hear due to the static sounds on the recording. The controller responded with: "Pay attention. Spirit 1300 traffic off your left wing by six mi— or eight miles, 747. I'm sure you can see who it is. ... Keep an eye out for him — he's white and blue" - the white and blue being a reference to the exterior colours of the president's aircraft.President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump arrived in the UK on Tuesday evening.'Woah that was close': Near-miss warning signs ahead of DC plane crashSpirit Airlines files for bankruptcy protectionTrump given spectacular royal welcome in Windsor‘Special does not begin to do it justice’, Trump says of UK-US relationship in state banquet speechUS begins preparing Qatari jet to be used as Air Force OneWashington DCDonald TrumpAir travelUnited StatesRelatedTrump's direct control of Washington DC police force set to expireSwinney and Trump have 'constructive discussion' over whisky tariffsWashington DC sues Trump administration over National Guard deploymentMore from the BBC5 mins agoTrump announces new tariffs on drugs, trucks and kitchen cabinetsThe US president said the move aims to help protect American manufacturers from foreign imports.5 mins ago45 mins agoComey indictment escalates Trump's promise of political retributionThe criminal case against Comey fulfils the president's desire to seek retribution and further raises concerns about abuse of power.45 mins ago2 hrs agoWatch: 'I'm not afraid', says James Comey after indictmentThe former FBI director said he had "great confidence in the federal judicial system" after being indicted on two charges.2 hrs ago2 hrs agoFormer FBI director James Comey indicted on two chargesJames Comey says he is innocent after being accused of lying to Congress in 2020 while testifying about leaks to the media.2 hrs ago6 hrs agoUS President Gerald Ford's would-be assassin dies at age 95Sara Jane Moore fired two shots at the Republican president during his visit to San Francisco in 1975.
