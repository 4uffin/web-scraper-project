"Pay attention. Get off the iPad," was the stern message issued to the Spirit pilot as the aircraft flew eight miles (12.8km) parallel to Air Force One, the US president's official plane, over New York on Tuesday.The planes were never within a distance that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) would classify as unsafe, but it was close enough to alarm officials."Safety is always our top priority," a Spirit spokesman told CBS, the BBC's US
partner.Spirit Flight 1300 "followed procedures and Air Traffic Control instructions" and "landed uneventfully" as planned in Boston, the airline said.The Spirit flight was travelling from Florida to Massachusetts. According to flight tracking site Flightradar24, the two planes were flying parallel to each other 8 miles apart, and were on paths on which they could have converged 11 miles apart,The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
"Preliminary investigation shows aircraft maintained the required separation." Air traffic control audio obtained by the BBC recorded controllers urgently and repeatedly telling the Spirit Airbus A321 to keep its distance. "Spirit 1300 turn 20 degrees right," an air traffic controller said, according to LiveATC audio. "Pay attention, Spirit 1300 turn 20 degrees right. Spirit 1300 turn 20 degrees right, now.
Spirit wings 1300 turn 20 degrees right, immediately."The budget airline pilots acknowledged the transmission, although their responses were difficult to hear due to the static sounds on the recording. The controller responded with: "Pay attention. Spirit 1300 traffic off your left wing by six mi— or eight miles, 747. I'm sure you can see who it is. ... Keep an eye out for him — he's white and blue" - the white and blue being a reference to the exterior colours of the president's aircraft.President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump arrived in the UK on Tuesday evening.'Woah that was close': Near-miss warning signs ahead of DC plane crashSpirit Airlines files for bankruptcy protectionTrump given spectacular royal welcome in Windsor‘Special does not begin to do it justice’, Trump says of UK-US relationship in state banquet speechUS begins preparing Qatari jet to be used as Air Force OneWashington DCDonald TrumpAir travelUnited StatesRelatedTrump's direct control of Washington DC police force set to expireSwinney and Trump have 'constructive discussion' over whisky tariffsWashington DC sues Trump administration over National Guard deploymentMore from the BBC36 mins agoFact-checking claims Trump made about autismExperts have hit back at claims that use of a common painkiller could cause autism in children.36 mins ago1 hr agoSecret Service disrupts telecom threat near UN General AssemblyInvestigators say the scheme could have shut down the cellular network in New York City.1 hr ago2 hrs agoEswatini says it has repatriated US deportee to JamaicaOrville Isaac Etoria had been held in prison in the southern African state after Trump's government expelled him.2 hrs ago3 hrs agoTrump says a TikTok deal is done.
