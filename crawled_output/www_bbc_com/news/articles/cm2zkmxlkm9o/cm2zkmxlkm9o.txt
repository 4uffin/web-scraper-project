It was not a rubber bullet. If you see my son, his head was broken, a hole is there."Narendra Shrestha wants to know who will take responsibility for the death of his son Sulov, who was among scores killed in violent unrest that rocked Nepal last week.Mr Shrestha, 45, is perched outside the gates of Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital's mortuary in the capital. He's already been inside and identified 21-year-old Sulov's body."I want to ask this country," he says, choking back tears, "if they can fire, they can shoot my son, then I and his mother, will also stand. Who will we live for now? We also want to die."A female family member sits beside him, holding his hand, while a man protects him from the beating sun with an umbrella.Other families were also waiting to identify their young loved ones whose lives were cut short: one had dreamed of being a judge, another was a student working in a Kathmandu hotel, a third was learning French.They are among more than 70 people who died in anti-corruption protests at the start of last week, which toppled the government of the Himalayan nation. More than 1,000 were injured in the two days of unrest.Pritam RoyNarendra Shrestha says his son was shot in the head: "Who will we live for now?"A ban on social media was the impetus for the protests, but anger against government corruption had been building in recent weeks. By the time the ban was reversed late on Monday, 8 September, the protests had swelled into a wider movement.Crowds torched politicians' homes and official buildings as an outpouring of anger at the ruling class boiled over.Many of those killed were shot - police are accused of opening fire on the crowds. But others were burned in fires or died in confrontations with police. Casualty figures have been going up as authorities clean up the debris.In response to the allegations, Nepal's police have said they will investigate what happened during those two days of violent protests. It's still unclear who gave the orders for security forces to open fire.Family handoutThere are several families like Mr Shrestha's waiting outside the mortuary for their names to be called so they can identify the bodies.One man, Rasik KC, is waiting for the body of his 22-year-old nephew, Rashik Khatiwada.Rashik was shot twice in the chest, Mr KC says. He found out about the death after seeing clips on social media.His anguish has now turned to anger, demanding some kind of accountability from the government."We want justice," he says.Family handoutAbhishek Chaulagain, 22,
was shot in the foreheadThe BBC spoke with more than a dozen people who lost family members in the protests.The relatives of Subash Bohora, 21, said there was a time in his life when he wanted to be a judge. He died outside Nepal's parliament building after a bullet pierced his neck.Ayush Thapa, 19, was a French language student who was interested in the British Army and hated Nepali politicians, his family says. He was shot in the chest.Abishek Chaulagain, 22, was a student working in one of the capital's hotels when he was shot in the forehead."We had never come across a disaster like this," says Ranjana Nepal, an information officer at the Civil Service Hospital in Kathmandu. She says they treated more than 450 patients in their emergency room during the protests. Six people died."Our hospital [has been] in operation for 17 years. We were able to manage patients during the earthquake. [This] situation was worse."On the first night of protests, Dr Santosh Paudel was working at Bir Hospital, not far from the parliament building. Of the 173 patients his team treated in the hospital's emergency ward, five died and four are still in critical condition.Dr Paudel says he was surprised to see patients with "sharp rifle injuries" in addition to rubber bullets."We saw [two types of bullets] clearly, the long one, which is fired by shotguns, and the small ones with the sharp edge that is fired from rifles," said Dr Paudel. He said many of the patients that came later in the day had multiple bullet injuries.Pritam RoyParliament was attacked and images of it set ablaze were seen around the world Protests began last Monday when thousands heeded a call by demonstrators describing themselves as Generation Z to gather near parliament in Kathmandu over the decision to ban platforms including Facebook, X and YouTube, as well as over wider dissatisfaction with the government.Ministers said police had to use force, which included water cannons, batons and firing rubber bullets.Saying they'd failed to register locally, the government announced social media platforms needed to be regulated to tackle fake news, hate speech and online fraud. But popular platforms such as Instagram have millions of users in Nepal, who rely on them for entertainment, news and business – and protesters accused the government of trying to silence them.By Tuesday, violent crowds were setting fire to government buildings in the capital Kathmandu. Parliament was torched even though Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli had already resigned.Nepal's new interim Prime Minister, Sushila Karki has a tough road ahead. Not only does the 73-year-old former chief justice need to appoint a new cabinet, she must rebuild confidence in the country's leadership. She has agreed to fresh elections on 5 March 2026, but the first real test of her new government will be her investigation into the protests and if she can bring the perpetrators of the deadly violence – including those who shot protesters, as well as those behind the widespread vandalism – to justice.Pritam Roy"International law says they are not allowed to shoot," says Abishek Shrestha, 22, from his hospital bed, his home for the next month. Metal rods protrude from the white and pink gauze wrapped around his right leg, where he was shot."I'm Nepali and they are not allowed to shoot me, but they shot me. It's all because of the government, police, rules and regulation. We have to change this."An investigation is little comfort to Mr Shrestha as he mourns Sulov."Politicians, they will say sorry. Sorry doesn't make a dead son come alive again."Additional reporting by Charlotte ScarrNepal's interim PM to hand over power within six monthsNepal's major parties say dissolved parliament must be reinstatedAsiaNepalRelatedPoliticians get rich while we suffer - so I helped bring down our government in 48 hoursUS officers tied us up and pointed guns at us, South Korean engineers tell BBCHomes damaged, cars swept away as rains flood India's UttarakhandMore from the BBC3 days agoNepal's interim PM to hand over power within six monthsSushila Karki said the government must heed protesters' demands for "an end to corruption, good governance and economic equality".3 days ago3 days agoNepal's major parties say dissolved parliament must be reinstatedThe House of Representatives was dissolved by the country's president, following deadly anti-corruption protests.3 days ago4 days agoNepal gets first female PM after deadly unrestFormer Supreme Court chief justice Sushila Karki is sworn in after a deal with protest leaders.4 days ago5 days agoWorried migrants head home from India after Nepal turmoilNepalis rush home from India as deadly protests have engulfed the Himalayan nation.5 days ago5 days agoSee Kathmandu's destroyed and barricaded streets after violenceThere's an intense military presence on the Nepali capital's streets, says the BBC's Samira Hussain.
