Lord Mandelson's emails "cut across the whole approach that I've taken on violence against women and girls for many years and this government's", he added.The emails showed "the nature and extent of the relationship that Peter Mandelson had with Epstein was far different to what I had understood to be the position when I appointed him."Sir Keir added he was "not at all" satisfied with Lord Mandelson's responses to questions "put to him by government officials".The prime minister has faced questions about his judgment in appointing the peer, whose friendship with Epstein was public knowledge, in the first place.Sir Keir insisted he did not know what was in the emails when he defended the US ambassador at Prime Minister's Questions but said he knew Foreign Office officials had asked Lord Mandelson questions about the email.The scandal, coming so soon after Angela Rayner's resignation as deputy prime minister, has encouraged some Labour MPs to become more vocal about their frustrations with the prime minister's leadership and the wider Downing Street operation.On Monday Sir Keir faced a further blow, when one of his senior aides, Paul Ovenden, resigned after the leaking of explicit messages about veteran MP Diane Abbott from eight years ago.The debate in Parliament could prove damaging for Sir Keir's efforts to draw a line under the scandal ahead of US President Donald Trump's state visit this week, and the Labour conference at the end of the month.Labour MPs are expressing public and private frustration with the prime minister's leadership.The Foreign Affairs Committee, chaired by Labour MP Dame Emily Thornberry, has demanded the government give evidence on how Lord Mandelson was cleared and appointed.Labour backbencher Richard Burgon told Radio 4's Today programme Sir Keir would be "gone" if May's elections in Scotland, Wales and parts of England go badly for Labour.The Conservatives have also demanded the prime minister release documents relating to Mandelson's appointment.In the letter to the prime minister, Tory MP Alex Burghart questioned what and when Sir Keir knew of Mandelson's friendship with Epstein before defending the former ambassador during Prime Minister's Questions last Wednesday.Sign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to keep up with the inner workings of Westminster and beyond.Keir StarmerLabour PartyRelatedPM's 'knee-bending' to Trump is
