On Wednesday, the 31-year-old right-wing American activist was fatally shot while speaking on stage in Utah. While these students disagreed with many of his views, they have unequivocally condemned the shooting and recognised his commitment to peaceful debate.'Political disagreement must never be a death sentence'SuppliedSammy McDonald described the death of Charlie Kirk as a "horrendous" actIn May, Kirk was invited to the Cambridge Union for a question and answer debate event.Sammy McDonald was the last student due to debate with him, and the US support of Israel's campaign in Gaza was a focal point of their discussion.The History student told the BBC: "Nothing - political or otherwise - can ever justify such a horrendous act or the ruination of the lives of those close to him."Political disagreement cannot be, and must never be, a death sentence."Even in deeply polarised times, we must never lose sight of our humanity and our respect for the sanctity of all human life." Charlie Kirk: Conservative influencer who rallied a youth movementHe said while Kirk was someone he "profoundly" disagreed with, he respected his commitment to the power of debate."We both recognised that the ability to debate ideas freely, to speak your mind without fear of violence is what distinguished democracy from tyranny and is the foundation on which the American republic and the liberal tradition is built."Referencing the deaths of MPs Jo Cox (Labour) and Sir David Amess (Conservative), he said young people were growing up in a world "sullied by increasing political violence and poisoned political discourse". "One of the most surprising experiences from my encounter with Kirk was the magnanimity and generosity of his many supporters, who were willing to talk to me, listen to me and acknowledge peaceful disagreement, even changing our preconceptions about each other." 'He did not incite violence'Cambridge Union/YouTubeTwenty-year-old Kai Bevan said Kirk's death warranted "self-reflection as a society"Kai Bevan, 20, a third-year medical student, debated with Kirk over his views on abortion."Never in a million years would I have thought something like that would happen."We had our differences, but the expression of those kinds of views should never entail a death sentence. I was mortified."He said others he had spoken to have been similarly "shocked" at the incident. "What affects me most is the fact that someone who, in a non-violent way, goes to college campuses and expresses his views - yes he's known to be inflammatory, but he's not known to incite violence or physical harm or suffering - and for someone who just does that to lose their life really warrants self-reflection as a society."'Trying to silence them is not going to work'SuppliedArchie Mackintosh believed Kirk ultimately wanted to make the world a better placeWhen Archie Mackintosh opened his question for Kirk, he admitted he was a "little nervous". "There's a real chance I could wake up tomorrow front page of YouTube: 'Charlie Kirk owns manbun idiot with facts and logistics'," he said. Kirk jokingly suggested an alternative: "Destroys."The 23-year-old from Norfolk exchanged opinions on marriage and society generally. He said he had yet to process Kirk's death."Despite the fact that I disagree with a lot of his opinions, maybe most of them, he was generally so driven about trying to make the world a better place in his eyes."Inflicting violence on someone you think is spreading harmful rhetoric, "will only turn them into a hero", he added."I think it will make people think, 'Wow', they were speaking so much truth that they had to be silenced."Even if you're 100% convinced that everything someone is saying will contribute negatively to the world, trying to silence them is not going to work."'Political violence affects all of us'Cambridge Union/YouTubeTilly Middlehurst said the death of Charlie Kirk was not what politics "should look like"Tilly Middlehurst, wearing a knitted cream jumper stitched with the stars and stripes of the United States, asked Kirk about religion, his views on the changing roles of women in society, and what defined a woman."I'm a feminist," she said, in opening her question.She shared her thoughts following his death with her 91,100 followers on Instagram, and said it had left her "shaken and disgusted"."Regardless of how you feel about Kirk, about violence, about politics, this was disastrous," she said.Posting on social media, she said this was not what politics "should look like". "Political violence like this affects all of us, it doesn't just affect the people that you disagree with."This isn't a step in the right direction. This isn't fighting fascism."Follow Cambridgeshire news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.More on this storyYoung fans and critics debate Charlie Kirk's political legacyA rooftop figure, gunfire, then panic - how Charlie Kirk shooting unfoldedRelated internet linksThe Cambridge UnionUniversity of CambridgeCambridgeUniversity of CambridgeEnglandUtahRelatedElectric bike crash causes life-threatening injuryTeacher celebrates another cricket final centuryVintage tractor auctioned for hospital playroomMore from the BBC15 hrs agoBritain's worst major train stations for cancellationsFigures show around one in 13 scheduled stops at City Thameslink were cancelled over the past year.15 hrs ago1 day agoWoman who returns uni key 40 years late avoids '£20k fine'Carla Risoldi, a summer school student at the college in 1985, returns the key on a visit to the UK.1 day ago2 days agoStab-proof vests to be given to thousands of prison officersJustice Secretary David Lammy is trying to improve jail safety after several high-profile attacks. 2 days ago3 days agoCharlie Kirk, the conservative influencer who became the voice of Maga youthThe influential Trump ally who at age 18 set up Turning Point USA died in a shooting while speaking at a Utah campus event.3 days ago4 days agoThe motive behind Charlie Kirk's killing: What we know and don't knowProsecutors have broadly outlined suspect Tyler Robinson's political views - but many questions remain.4 days agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
