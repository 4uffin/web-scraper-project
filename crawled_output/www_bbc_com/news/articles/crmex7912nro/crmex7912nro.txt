The report also said one of the pilots was heard asking the other "why did he cut off" in a cockpit voice recording, with another pilot responding that he did not do so.The recording doesn't clarify who said what. At the time of take-off, the co-pilot was flying the aircraft while the captain was monitoring.But the findings of the report have been challenged by aviation safety group Safety Matters Foundation, which is calling for an independent investigation into the crash.In a court hearing overseeing the aviation safety group's petition, one of India's Supreme Court judges said that suggestions that the pilots deliberately shut off fuel supply were "very unfortunate and irresponsible".The crash has left many questioning the safety of India's airspace. The chief of the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has defended the safety record of the country, telling the BBC in July that "India's skies have always been safe". That same month, the DGCA uncovered 51 safety violations at Air India in the preceding year, as part of its annual audit of the country's airlines.The families of four passengers who died on the plane filed a lawsuit in the US against planemaker Boeing and aircraft parts maker Honeywell, accusing the companies of negligence.The lawsuit accused the companies of doing "nothing" despite being aware of the risks of the aircraft's design.Air India watchdog audit reveals 51 safety violationsAir India crash victims' families sue aerospace firms Boeing and HoneywellCompaniesAviation accidents and incidentsAviation safetyAir India flight AI171 plane crashAir travelRelatedBosch to cut 13,000 jobs to save billions in costsJLR restarts some IT systems after cyber-attackGovernment could buy car parts to protect Jaguar Land Rover suppliersMore from the BBC12 hrs agoFlight attendant hurt in plane steps fall - reportThe accident happened as the door on the flight was being closed at East Midlands Airport.12 hrs ago1 day agoThe sun sets on India's iconic and controversial Soviet fighter jetMiG-21 served in all conflicts with Pakistan since 1965 and was later known for a high crash rate.1 day ago2 days agoMan arrested in connection with cyber-attack on airportsThe National Crime Agency (NCA) said a man in his forties was arrested in West Sussex.2 days ago3 days agoAfghan boy flies from Kabul to Delhi hiding in plane's landing gearThe 13-year-old boy was questioned by security officials on landing and sent back to Kabul on the same flight. 3 days ago3 days agoGatwick expansion 'has opportunities for Jersey'Matt Thomas says the decision would bring greater connectivity for the island.3 days agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseSubscription TermsAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
