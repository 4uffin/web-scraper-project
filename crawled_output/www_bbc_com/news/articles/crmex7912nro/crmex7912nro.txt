The report also said one of the pilots was heard asking the other "why did he cut off" in a cockpit voice recording, with another pilot responding that he did not do so.The recording doesn't clarify who said what. At the time of take-off, the co-pilot was flying the aircraft while the captain was monitoring.But the findings of the report have been challenged by aviation safety group Safety Matters Foundation, which is calling for an independent investigation into the crash.In a court hearing overseeing the aviation safety group's petition, one of India's Supreme Court judges said that suggestions that the pilots deliberately shut off fuel supply were "very unfortunate and irresponsible".The crash has left many questioning the safety of India's airspace. The chief of the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has defended the safety record of the country, telling the BBC in July that "India's skies have always been safe". That same month, the DGCA uncovered 51 safety violations at Air India in the preceding year, as part of its annual audit of the country's airlines.The families of four passengers who died on the plane filed a lawsuit in the US against planemaker Boeing and aircraft parts maker Honeywell, accusing the companies of negligence.The lawsuit accused the companies of doing "nothing" despite being aware of the risks of the aircraft's design.Air India watchdog audit reveals 51 safety violationsAir India crash victims' families sue aerospace firms Boeing and HoneywellCompaniesAviation accidents and incidentsAviation safetyAir India flight AI171 plane crashAir travelRelatedUS ready to help with Argentina's fiscal turmoilBodycare to shut remaining stores with loss of 444 jobsNext warns UK economy faces 'anaemic' growthMore from the BBC9 hrs agoGatwick expansion sparks mixed local reactionTransport Secretary Heidi Alexander approves a £2.2bn privately-financed project at Gatwick Airport.9 hrs ago10 hrs agoDublin Airport disruption continues into third day after cyber-attackA spokesperson for the airport said it is continuing to support airlines on Monday due to the aftermath "from the Europe-wide technical issue". 10 hrs ago10 hrs agoGatwick second runway plan approved by transport secretaryThere has been strong opposition against the airport wanting to use its northern runway.10 hrs ago12 hrs agoGatwick second runway plan approved by transport secretary12 hrs ago12 hrs agoCan the UK expand airports and still hit climate targets?Plans for the expansion of Gatwick, Heathrow and Luton could mean hundreds of thousands of additional flights a year.
