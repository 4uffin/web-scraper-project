However, the violence has continued.Additional reporting by Mariama Soumana in NiameyYou may also be interested in:Niger military leaders to nationalise uranium firmThree military-run states leave West African bloc - what will change?WATCH: How has Niger changed since the coup?Getty Images/BBCGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.Follow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafricaBBC Africa podcastsFocus on AfricaThis Is AfricaSahel Islamist insurgencyNigerAfricaRelatedJihadists 'summarily executed' 127 people in Niger, says rights group
