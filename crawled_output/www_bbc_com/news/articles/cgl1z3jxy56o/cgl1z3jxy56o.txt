You might wonder how these products work and whether they're foolproof enough to put the fear of bleeding through your clothes at bay. Dr Tempest, a consultant gynaecologist at the University of Liverpool, spoke to Radio 4's Sliced Bread about how each product works and the pros and cons to help you decide which might suit you best.Listen to Dr Tempest talk about period productsMenstrual cupGetty ImagesMenstrual cups are small flexible cups made of medical-grade silicone. You fold and insert them into the vagina, where they collect blood rather than absorbing it.Dr Tempest says there are different types of cups available to buy based on how heavy your flow is or whether you've had children.Hygiene is also really important so make sure you wash your hands before you insert the cup and clean the cup between uses, she adds.ProsThe most eco-friendly period product Holds up to three times more blood than a tampon Can be worn for up to 12 hours Reusable for years - they can last up to 10 years but between two and four years is the average Cost effective over time ConsTakes practice to insert and remove May take time to find the right fit Messy to empty, especially in a public toilet Needs sterilising between cycles Larger upfront cost which can be around £20 to £25Period pants Getty ImagesPeriod pants are underwear with built-in absorbent layers. You wear them like normal pants then rinse, wash and dry them for reuse.They're particularly popular for sleeping or on lighter days. Leakage worries are normal but Dr Tempest says they are reliable for most people and have a built-in waterproof layer and odour lining.ProsLooks and feels like regular underwear No shifting around and last between six and eight hoursReusable and eco-friendly - they last between two and three years Can be layered with other products for extra protections ConsCan have an expensive upfront cost - prices start from around £10 and go up to £50 Requires washing and drying between uses May not be absorbent enough for heavy flows Inconvenient for travel without access to laundry Will need to carry a used pair home with you if changing them during the dayReusable padsGetty ImagesReusable pads look similar to disposable ones but are usually made from cotton or bamboo and fasten around your underwear with poppers. Instead of throwing them away, you rinse, wash and dry them to use again.Pros Softer and more comfortable to wear than plastic-based pads Eco-friendly so popular if you're wanting a more sustainable optionVariety of sizes and absorbencies Cost effective over timeCan last between three and five yearsConsNeed to be washed after each use Requires planning - they must be dried properly between uses says Dr Tempest as damp fabric against your skin can increase the risk of infectionBulkier than disposable padsLess convenient if you're out of the house as you'll need to carry the used ones home with youDisposable PadsGetty ImagesDisposable sanitary pads are the most commonly used period product - they stick into your underwear, absorb blood externally and are wrapped and binned after use.Dr Tempest advises changing pads regularly (every four to six hours) and they shouldn't be worn for more than eight hours as they can irritate the skin if worn for too long. ProsSimple to use Widely available in many different sizes from ultra-thin to thick night padsGood for overnight protectionCan be more comfortable for beginners ConsCan feel bulky or shift out of place Not practical for water-based sports, such as swimmingEnvironmentally harmful - an average pack of pads holds the same amount of plastic as five carrier bags according to Dr TempestMore expensive than reusable options over time - women spend around £5,000 on period products over a lifetimeTampons Getty ImagesTampons are also commonly used and inserted into the vagina, where they soak up blood before it leaves the body.Dr Tempest stresses that they must be correctly disposed of.Every day, 2.5 million tampons are flushed down the toilet when they should be placed in a bin. ProsDiscreet and small enough to carry in a pocketGood for sports and swimming Range of absorbenciesConsRequires insertion which some people may find uncomfortable Low risk of Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS) if worn for too long Environmentally unfriendlyMore expensive over a lifetime compared to reusable products Struggling with brain fog?
