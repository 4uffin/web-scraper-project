The prosecutor also stressed that the accused is innocent until proven guilty and will face trial by jury.He unveiled a trove of evidence at a news conference on Tuesday, including the defendant's alleged confession and DNA found on the trigger of the rifle suspected to have been used in the crime.An alleged hidden confessionDescribing the alleged hidden note at a news conference earlier on Tuesday, Mr Gray said the defendant had sent a text message to his roommate reading: "Drop what you're doing, look under my keyboard."After reading the apparent confession, the roommate, who has not been named and is co-operating with investigators, replied: "What?????????????? You're joking, right????"Read full message thread between suspect and roommateWho is Tyler Robinson?Kirk shooting suspect appeared to confess on Discord'We knew the family': Utah town in disbeliefMr Gray cited further lengthy text message exchanges between the defendant and his roommate, whom he described as his romantic partner. Authorities have said the roommate is transgender and transitioning from man to woman.In one exchange, the roommate asked the defendant why he had killed Kirk."'I had enough of his hatred,'" Mr Gray cited the messages as saying. "'Some hate can't be negotiated out.'"The defendant also allegedly wrote: "To be honest I had hoped to keep this secret till I died of old age. I am sorry to involve you."The roommate replied: "you weren't the one who did it right????"The defendant replied: "I am, I'm sorry."Watch: Robinson left hidden note for roommate, official revealsSuspect's parents confronted himMr Gray also gave more detail about how the defendant's parents became suspicious that their son may have been involved in Charlie Kirk's killing.He said the mother had seen a video of the suspect released a day after the shooting and told her husband it looked like their son. She confronted the son over the phone about the resemblance, Mr Gray said, but he told her he had been home sick on the day of the shooting.The father later confronted the defendant, who responded by implying he might take his own life, the prosecutor said.The suspect was eventually persuaded to come to his parents' house and while there, allegedly hinted he was the attacker. He then said he wanted to "end it" rather than go to jail, Mr Gray said.With the help of a family friend, who is a retired deputy sheriff, his parents convinced him to surrender to police and he was arrested late on Thursday - 33 hours after the shooting.The suspect also allegedly told his parents that "there is too much evil and the guy spreads too much hate", in a reference to Kirk, according to the indictment.The mother told investigators her son had become more political in recent years, Mr Gray said, becoming more supportive of gay and transgender rights and entering a relationship with a transgender person.But the prosecutor declined to answer when asked if Kirk had been targeted for his transgender views. "That is for a jury to decide," he said.Mr Gray said the conservative influencer was answering a question about mass shootings carried out by transgender individuals when the gunshot rang out. The bullet struck Kirk in the neck and he immediately slumped to the ground.The shot passed close to other people, including children and the person who asked Kirk the question, said the prosecutor.Watch: Suspect’s texts include "admissions" helpful to case, Utah official tells the BBCDNA on the rifle triggerMr Gray said the suspect's DNA had been found on the trigger of the rifle used in the shooting.He also said the suspect's father had suspected the weapon matched a bolt-action rifle that had once belonged to the suspect's grandfather.
He contacted the suspect after the shooting and asked him to send a photo of the rifle, but he did not reply, Mr Gray said.The defendant also detailed his movements after the shooting in messages sent to his roommate. "I had planned to grab my rifle from my drop point shortly after, but most of that side of town got locked down," he wrote, according to prosecutors."Going to attempt to retrieve it again, hopefully they have moved on. I haven't seen anything about them finding it," another message allegedly read. "I can get close to it but there is a squad car parked right by it."The defendant is also charged with witness tampering, prosecutors said, because he directed his partner to delete their messages and stay silent if questioned.Watch: "Dark moment for America", Trump says after killing of Charlie KirkUnited StatesUtahRelatedFormer FBI director James Comey indicted on two chargesUS President Gerald Ford's would-be assassin dies at age 95Amazon agrees to pay $2.5bn over claims it tricked Prime customersMore from the BBC18 hrs agoFugitive Nicholas Rossi found guilty of second rape in USThe American who faked his death and fled to Scotland to escape justice was convicted by a Utah jury.18 hrs ago5 days agoCharlie Kirk, the conservative influencer who became the voice of Maga youthThe influential Trump ally who at age 18 set up Turning Point USA died in a shooting while speaking at a Utah campus event.5 days ago6 days agoThe motive behind Charlie Kirk's killing: What we know and don't knowProsecutors have broadly outlined suspect Tyler Robinson's political views - but many questions remain.6 days ago7 days agoABC takes Jimmy Kimmel off air over Charlie Kirk commentsThe late-night host criticised the Republican response to the killing and his
