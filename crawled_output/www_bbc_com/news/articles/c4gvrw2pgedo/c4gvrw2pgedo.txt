Cox added that the partner did not have any knowledge about the alleged shooting, had been "incredibly co-operative" and was working with investigators "right now".The governor was also asked about a New York Times report alleging Mr Robinson had spoken to others after the shooting via the Discord messaging platform, including allegations that he joked about being the gunman.His "doppelganger," he wrote, was trying to "get me in trouble", according to messages seen by the Times.Cox told ABC News: "All we can confirm is that those conversations definitely were happening, and they did not believe it was actually him."It was, it was all joking until, until he, you know, until he admitted that it actually was him."Mr Robinson was arrested on Thursday night after surrendering to police.An affidavit from the state of Utah confirms that Mr Robinson was arrested on suspicion of the crimes of aggravated murder, felony discharge of a firearm, and obstruction of justice.He is currently being held without bail at Utah County Jail."We're interviewing all kinds of people - everyone that knows him - and trying to learn more about what the motive actually was," Cox said.Following Kirk's death, Cox has been prominent in calling for unity in a bid to ease political tensions, and has made repeated comments criticising social media.He previously called social media a "cancer" and told CNN the US had "to get phones out of the classrooms" and better efforts to hold platform owners to account.He called Kirk's shooting a "direct assault on America" and said Americans needed to "look in the mirror and decide, are we going to try to make it better, or are we going to make it worse?"Kirk's widow, Erika, on Saturday gave a tearful address in which she thanked first responders for their efforts and vowed that her "husband's voice will remain".A memorial service will be held on 21 September at the 60,000-seat State Farm Stadium in Arizona, the state where Kirk lived with his wife and two children.Kirk, a controversial figure in US politics, was one of the highest profile right-wing activists in the US and a trusted ally of US President Donald Trump.Turning Point USA aimed to spread conservative ideals at liberal-leaning US colleges, and played a key role in getting people to vote for Trump and other Republican candidates in the election last year.Kirk was a strong supporter of gun rights, vehemently opposed abortion, was critical of transgender and gay rights and promoted false claims about Covid-19. His supporters said he was relatable and understood their concerns. But his views drew fierce liberal criticism, with his detractors calling his comments deeply offensive to some minority groups, including LGBT people and Muslims.Watch: How the Charlie Kirk shooting unfoldedHow 33-hour manhunt ended with Charlie Kirk suspect in custodyCharlie Kirk memorial service set to take place in Arizona stadiumUnited StatesUtahRelatedTrump vows tough action after beheading of Indian motel managerBrazil's Lula hits back at Trump over Bolsonaro trial and tariffsDonald Trump's UK state visit is this week - here's what we knowMore from the BBC1 day agoStudents who debated with Charlie Kirk mourn his deathThe young academics, who disagreed with many of Kirk's political views, say they are devastated.1 day ago1 day agoWho is Tyler Robinson, the suspect in custody for shooting Charlie Kirk?The FBI says a family member recognised the 22-year-old man from Utah from surveillance images released to the public. 1 day ago1 day ago'We knew the family': Utah town in disbelief after local resident accused of killing Charlie KirkTyler Robinson is accused of killing Charlie Kirk during an open-air speaking event.1 day ago2 days ago'I will never let your legacy die' - Charlie Kirk's widow gives tearful address after shootingThe organisation Kirk co-founded will host a memorial at a 60,000+ seat stadium in Arizona.2 days ago2 days agoCharlie Kirk: Conservative influencer who rallied a youth movementKirk, an influential Trump ally who at age 18 set up Turning Point USA, died in a shooting while speaking at a Utah campus event.2 days agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
