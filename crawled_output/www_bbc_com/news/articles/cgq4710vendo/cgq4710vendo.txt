But more observations of "scrumping apes" have emerged in recent years, said Prof Catherine Hobaiter, a primatologist at the University of St Andrews, who was not part of the research team."What we're realising from this work is that our relationship with alcohol goes deep back into evolutionary time, probably about 30 million years," she told BBC News."Maybe for chimpanzees, this is a great way to create social bonds, to hang out together on the forest floor, eating those fallen fruits."

Had they done so,
"this would clearly not improve their survival chances," she said.According to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, chimpanzees are endangered and the biggest threats they face include losing their forest homes to farming, logging and building roads or towns. The research is published in the journal Science Advances.PrimatesChimpanzeesAnimalsRelatedLink found between primate thumb and brain sizePint-sized monkeys saved from extinction now in zooCharity 'heartbroken' after death of 'beloved' apeMore from the BBC8 hrs agoWallaby missing from farm after firework displayThe wallaby's owner is worried it may not be found after it escaped its enclosure at a Glastonbury farm.8 hrs ago11 hrs agoThree more lions rescued from war-torn UkraineThe animals, thought to be about a year old, will be living as a pride at Yorkshire Wildlife Park.11 hrs ago18 hrs agoThe lonely life and death of Delhi's only African elephantFor 24 years, Shankar endured a lonely existence - including at least 13 spent in solitary confinement.18 hrs ago2 days agoSafari park announces death of red panda Lionel, a popular animal among visitors, fathered four cubs during his life at the Wiltshire estate.2 days ago2 days agoEscaped monkey who 'went for a stroll' is home safeJoey, a South American capuchin monkey, is back in his habitat after he escaped
