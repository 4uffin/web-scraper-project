But more observations of "scrumping apes" have emerged in recent years, said Prof Catherine Hobaiter, a primatologist at the University of St Andrews, who was not part of the research team."What we're realising from this work is that our relationship with alcohol goes deep back into evolutionary time, probably about 30 million years," she told BBC News."Maybe for chimpanzees, this is a great way to create social bonds, to hang out together on the forest floor, eating those fallen fruits."

Had they done so,
"this would clearly not improve their survival chances," she said.According to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, chimpanzees are endangered and the biggest threats they face include losing their forest homes to farming, logging and building roads or towns. The research is published in the journal Science Advances.PrimatesChimpanzeesAnimalsRelatedLink found between primate thumb and brain sizePint-sized monkeys saved from extinction now in zooCharity 'heartbroken' after death of 'beloved' apeMore from the BBC20 hrs agoWe turned our home into a 'hedgehog hospital'A husband and wife have devote the last three years to helping the spiky mammals when they are found ill or injured.20 hrs ago1 day agoJungle cats reunited at Lincolnshire parkTeddy joins Binks in their new enclosure at Ark Wildlife Park near Boston.1 day ago2 days agoEmil the Elk caught after long summer on the loose in Central EuropeHe's travelled roads and forded streams but Emil the elk's wanderings have now come to an end in Austria. 2 days ago5 days agoLost snake back home after two-month disappearanceRed-tailed boa Zeus is no longer on the loose after giving his owner the slip.5 days ago5 days agoWallaby missing from farm after firework displayThe wallaby's owner is worried it may not be found after it escaped its enclosure at a Glastonbury farm.5 days agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
