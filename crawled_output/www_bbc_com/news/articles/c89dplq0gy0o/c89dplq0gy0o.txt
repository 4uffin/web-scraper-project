Ceesay, who has spent almost three years as auditor general in the West African state, says he had turned down Barrow's recent offer to become trade minister.Yet the president insists that Ceesay originally agreed, but later changed his mind.The row has angered many Gambians, with some accusing the president of trying to replace Ceesay with someone who will shield him from corruption allegations.The president has promoted the Director of Internal Audit, Cherno Amadou Sowe, to the post of auditor general, but he has not reported to work following the public backlash. On Monday, plain-clothes police were sent to the auditor general's office to arrest Ceesay and install his successor.But Ceesay's staff confronted the officers and stalled them, in scenes that were broadcast live on the social media accounts of local news outlets. It was not until back-up forces arrived that the auditor general was finally ejected from a press conference he was giving and escorted out of the complex to his lawyer's office. This action triggered a swift response from young people, who called on the president to reinstate Ceesay, and threatened to take to the streets in the outskirts of the capital, Banjul, until their demands were met."He refused your appointment. Now you forcibly remove him out of the office? Are the Gambian people not watching?" asked Gambian activist Kemo Fatty, expressing his fury in a clip which is circulating online.
"If the auditor general does not return to office today, President Barrow will leave the State House today," he threatened.Fatty and another anti-corruption activist, Alieu Bah, were later arrested by police, as they gathered at the national audit office and prepared for a press conference. In recent months, Barrow's government has been rocked by numerous protests following an investigation by a local newspaper, The Republic, alleging that assets belonging to the disgraced former President Yahya Jammeh had been distributed among close aides of Barrow. He has denied any wrongdoing.In a statement, Barrow's office said the government remained "firmly committed to the rule of law, transparency, accountability, and the responsible management of public finances". Ceesay's appointment as trade minister was "based solely on his qualifications and experience", and was not intended "to interfere with the operations of the National Audit Office".More BBC stories from The Gambia:'Bakoteh Messi' - footballer Minteh's rise from Gambian sand pitchesGambia probes sale of ex-leader's luxury cars, cows and boatsLISTEN: The Gambia's 'Queen of Recycling'Getty Images/BBCGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.Follow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafricaBBC Africa podcastsFocus on AfricaThis Is AfricaThe GambiaAfricaRelatedBoat heading to Canary Islands capsizes, killing at least 69 passengersOutrage as baby dies after genital mutilation in The GambiaGambia probes sale of ex-leader's luxury cars, cows and boatsMore from the BBC15 mins agoNigerian chef breaks world record for largest jollof rice dishGuinness World Records has confirmed the achievement, saying the rice weighed in at a staggering 8,780kg.15 mins ago13 hrs agoMalawi set to vote for next president as cost-of-living bitesCampaigns were overshadowed by price rises and fuel shortages.13 hrs ago16 hrs agoMen jailed for witchcraft murder plot against Zambia's presidentThe pair were sentenced to two years in prison after being found with charms, including a chameleon.16 hrs ago2 days agoZulu king challenges professor to stick fightProf Musa Xulu tells the BBC he has received threats from hired assassins and has complained to the police.2 days ago2 days agoPot breaks as Nigerian chef attempts to cook largest jollof rice dishHilda Baci and a team of assistants took nine hours to complete the popular West African dish.2 days agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
