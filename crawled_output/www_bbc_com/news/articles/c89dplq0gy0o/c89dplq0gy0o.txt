Ceesay, who has spent almost three years as auditor general in the West African state, says he had turned down Barrow's recent offer to become trade minister.Yet the president insists that Ceesay originally agreed, but later changed his mind.The row has angered many Gambians, with some accusing the president of trying to replace Ceesay with someone who will shield him from corruption allegations.The president has promoted the Director of Internal Audit, Cherno Amadou Sowe, to the post of auditor general, but he has not reported to work following the public backlash. On Monday, plain-clothes police were sent to the auditor general's office to arrest Ceesay and install his successor.But Ceesay's staff confronted the officers and stalled them, in scenes that were broadcast live on the social media accounts of local news outlets. It was not until back-up forces arrived that the auditor general was finally ejected from a press conference he was giving and escorted out of the complex to his lawyer's office. This action triggered a swift response from young people, who called on the president to reinstate Ceesay, and threatened to take to the streets in the outskirts of the capital, Banjul, until their demands were met."He refused your appointment. Now you forcibly remove him out of the office? Are the Gambian people not watching?" asked Gambian activist Kemo Fatty, expressing his fury in a clip which is circulating online.
"If the auditor general does not return to office today, President Barrow will leave the State House today," he threatened.Fatty and another anti-corruption activist, Alieu Bah, were later arrested by police, as they gathered at the national audit office and prepared for a press conference. In recent months, Barrow's government has been rocked by numerous protests following an investigation by a local newspaper, The Republic, alleging that assets belonging to the disgraced former President Yahya Jammeh had been distributed among close aides of Barrow. He has denied any wrongdoing.In a statement, Barrow's office said the government remained "firmly committed to the rule of law, transparency, accountability, and the responsible management of public finances". Ceesay's appointment as trade minister was "based solely on his qualifications and experience", and was not intended "to interfere with the operations of the National Audit Office".More BBC stories from The Gambia:'Bakoteh Messi' - footballer Minteh's rise from Gambian sand pitchesGambia probes sale of ex-leader's luxury cars, cows and boatsLISTEN: The Gambia's 'Queen of Recycling'Getty Images/BBCGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.Follow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafricaBBC Africa podcastsFocus on AfricaThis Is AfricaThe GambiaAfricaRelatedBoat heading to Canary Islands capsizes, killing at least 69 passengersOutrage as baby dies after genital mutilation in The GambiaGambia probes sale of ex-leader's luxury cars, cows and boatsMore from the BBC2 hrs agoEswatini says it has repatriated US deportee to JamaicaOrville Isaac Etoria had been held in prison in the southern African state after Trump's government expelled him.2 hrs ago4 hrs agoMalawi ex-president takes clear lead in vote-count, results showPeter Mutharika has got about 66% of the votes counted so far, putting him ahead of President Lazarus Chakwera.4 hrs ago6 hrs agoThree West African countries to quit International Criminal CourtThe three military juntas, who came to power through coups, say the judicial body is 'incapable' of handling 'proven war crimes'.6 hrs ago1 day ago'I'm Kenyan, don't shoot' - the athlete who says he was duped into the Russian armyEvans Kibet, now being held in Ukraine after surrendering, says he did not know he was signing up.1 day ago1 day agoBotswana declares public holiday after 'historic' athletics gold medalPresident Duma Boko congratulates the men's 4x400m relay team for winning gold at the World Athletic Championships.1 day agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
