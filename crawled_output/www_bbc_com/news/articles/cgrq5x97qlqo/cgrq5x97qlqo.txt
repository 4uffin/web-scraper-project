Fed board ahead of key interest rate vote7 days agoShareSaveOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterShareSaveGetty ImagesStephen Miran will be the first sitting White House official to join the Fed's board in decadesThe US Senate has cleared President Donald Trump's pick Stephen Miran to join the Federal Reserve's board of governors - part of a panel responsible for setting the country's interest rates.Miran, who is chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, will be the first sitting White House official to join the Fed's board since its creation in its current form in the 1930s.He was narrowly confirmed on Monday with a vote of 48-47.The economist's entry has raised concerns over the central bank's longstanding independence and follows Trump's bid to reshape the Federal Reserve.Miran is expected to take part in a key Fed policy meeting this week as one of 12 voting members, playing a central role in Trump's bid for a large interest rate cut.The Fed is expected to approve a quarter-percentage point rate cut to support a weakening labour market.Miran is a supporter of Trump's global tariffs, arguing the import duties won't fuel inflation and that policies like stricter immigration will reduce housing demand and lower prices.The White House economist's fast-tracked confirmation vote has proceeded in just a few weeks, when it typically takes months for a Fed governor nominee to be confirmed by the Senate.Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat, raised concerns that Miran would be seen as a "puppet" who would not be trusted as an independent voice on the Fed board.Trump has put pressure on the Fed for months, demanding interest rate cuts to give the US economy a boost and make it cheaper for the government to borrow.The president has taken aim at Fed chair Jerome Powell, calling him a "numbskull" and "too late".The Miran vote also comes as Trump is also attempting to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook from the central bank, citing allegations of mortgage fraud and constitutional powers to remove her.Cook, the first black woman to serve as a Fed governor, has denied the allegations and sued to block her removal.She has voted in recent months to keep interest rates on hold this year.On Monday, a US appeals court denied the justice department's request to lift an earlier ruling to temporarily block Trump from removing Cook.The Trump administration is also pursuing mortgage fraud investigations against Senator Adam Schiff and New York Attorney General Letitia James, both political antagonists of the president.US economyInternational BusinessUS Federal ReserveDonald TrumpRelatedCould the US interest rate cut boost the housing market?Fed Reserve cuts interest rates but cautions over stalling job marketPoorer Americans hit hardest as tariffs fuel price risesMore from the BBC13 mins agoTrump designates Antifa a 'domestic terrorist organisation'Trump signed an executive order as part of his crackdown on the "radical left" after the assassination of Charlie Kirk.13 mins ago25 mins agoWhat is Antifa and why is President Trump targeting it?President Trump has signed an executive order designating Antifa as a domestic terror group, but legal experts have questioned how this will work. 25 mins ago52 mins agoUS Supreme Court to revisit laws curtailing Trump's power to fire top officialsThe ruling allows the president to remove the sole Democratic official on the Federal Trade Commission, an independent body set up by Congress.52 mins ago1 hr agoWhat's the big deal about AI data centres?Huge investment is going into data centres for AI, but why are they so expensive?1 hr ago2 hrs agoTrump urges pregnant women to avoid Tylenol over unproven autism linkSome studies have suggested an association between the two, but experts say there is no causal relationship. 2 hrs agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
