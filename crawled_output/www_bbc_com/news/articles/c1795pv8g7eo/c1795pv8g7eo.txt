Now we need to move forward and figure out what comes next," Rubio said of the attack in Qatar before he departed for Israel.In his remarks at Joint Base Andrews, Rubio added that Trump's priority remained the return of all hostages and an end to the war. Hamas members had been in Doha to discuss the latest US proposal for a ceasefire in Gaza when Israel launched its strikes.When asked whether the strike on Doha complicated Qatar's willingness to work with the US, Rubio said "they've been good partners on a number of fronts".Qatar - a key US ally in the region and the location of a major American air base -
will host an emergency Arab-Islamic summit on Monday to discuss next moves. Doha has condemned Israel's attack as "cowardly" and a "flagrant violation of international law". On Sunday, Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani urged the international community to "abandon double standards" and punish Israel for its "crimes".Speaking at a preparatory meeting ahead of the summit, he added that Israel's practices would not stop Qatar's efforts to mediate an end to the war in Gaza.Netanyahu has said the move in Qatar was "fully justified" because it targeted senior Hamas leaders who organised the 7 October 2023 attacks.Some 48 Israeli hostages, of whom 20 are believed to remain alive, are being held by Hamas in Gaza. Their families have said Netanyahu is the "one obstacle" preventing their return and reaching a peace deal.The Hostages and Missing Families Forum wrote on social media that Israel's strike on Qatar last week shows "every time a deal approaches, Netanyahu sabotages it".ReutersRubio and Netanyahu visited the Western Wall in JerusalemNetanyahu's plan to occupy Gaza City has drawn international criticism, with the UN warning a military escalation in an area where famine has been declared will push civilians into an "even deeper catastrophe".Footage from Sunday verified by the BBC showed bombs hitting the al-Kawthar tower. Local officials told Reuters that at least 30 residential buildings had been destroyed. Israel said it had completed five waves of air strikes on the city over the past week, targeting more than 500 sites including what it said were Hamas reconnaissance and sniper sites, buildings containing tunnel openings and weapons depots.Israel has demanded that Gaza City's residents leave the city and head south and on Saturday the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it estimated about 250,000 Palestinians had fled, though hundreds of thousands are believed to remain in the area. Hamas has called on people not to leave.Some say they cannot afford to go while others say southern Gaza is not safe either as Israel has carried out air strikes there too."The bombardment intensified everywhere and we took down the tents, more than 20 families, we do not know where to go," Musbah al-Kafarna, displaced in Gaza City, told Reuters.ReutersPalestinians continue to flee Israel's bombardment of Gaza City, heading southOn Sunday, the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza said the bodies of 68 people killed by the Israeli military had arrived at its hospitals over the previous day.Since UN-backed global food security experts confirmed a famine in Gaza City on 22 August, the ministry has reported that at least 144 people have died from starvation and malnutrition across the territory. Israel has said it is expanding its efforts to facilitate aid deliveries and has disputed the health ministry's figures on malnutrition-related deaths.The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.At least 64,871 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.Middle EastIsrael-Gaza warIsraelRelatedIsrael and the Palestinians: History of the conflict explainedDoes Israel face a 'South Africa moment' over Gaza?Qatar hosts Arab-Islamic emergency summit over Israeli strike on DohaMore from the BBC5 hrs agoIsrael launches ground offensive on Gaza CityIt comes as a UN commission of inquiry found that Israel was committing genocide in Gaza.5 hrs ago5 hrs ago'The bombing has been insane': Palestinians scramble to flee Israeli assault on Gaza CityPalestinians tell the BBC whole residential blocks have been levelled as the Israeli army ramps up its offensive in the city.5 hrs ago7 hrs agoIsrael has committed genocide in Gaza, UN commission of inquiry saysThe panel finds that four of the five genocidal acts defined under international law have been carried out against Palestinians during the war.7 hrs ago14 hrs agoBowen: UN commission report on genocide is blunt indictment of Israel's actions in GazaA new report accuses Israel of committing genocide in Gaza, in "the strongest and most authoritative UN finding to date". 14 hrs ago16 hrs agoUS Secretary of State inaugurates Israeli settler-led archaeological site in JerusalemMarco Rubio was a guest of honour at contentious tunnel excavated under Palestinian homes in occupied East Jerusalem.16 hrs agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
