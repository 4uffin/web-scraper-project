She told BBC Radio 1's Newsbeat she started watching the series during the pandemic – and is now addicted."It was - and is - a sense of comfort, especially with what's been going on in the world lately. You won't get shamed for it!" she said.She is hosting the party to raise money for charity – and to meet new people."I thought it would be a good way to fundraise and to create an event people would want to meet people at, with something they have in common. The Summer I Turned Pretty is something I really enjoyed – and I know a lot of people enjoy the show."My friend put me on to the series – I'm a similar age to Belly, so it's also a sense of relatability. Season three revolves around her finding herself, so in that sense I can relate to that... but I've never had two brothers fighting over me!"Erika Doss/PrimeJeremiah (left) has been dubbed "the internet's most hated boyfriend"'Like the Super Bowl'Prime Video has said the season three premiere drew 25 million viewers in its first week, hit number one on the platform in 120 countries, and is its most-watched season among women ages 18-34, according to the Los Angeles Times.Han, who wrote the original books and co-wrote the final episode, told the paper she had enjoyed seeing people come together to watch the show "like it's the Super Bowl".She has, however, cautioned fans against personal abuse on social media."People can forget that you're talking about a character, but you're saying things about the person that plays the character when you're talking about their appearance or mannerisms," she said."That is a real person, and just because they're famous doesn't mean that it's not painful to read those things."We'll meet again?Han also put a message in the end credits of the finale thanking viewers and teasing a possible future spin-off."Thank you from the bottom of my heart for the love you've shown The Summer I Turned Pretty all these years," she wrote."Whether you've been with Belly since the very first book or joined us with the show I'm so grateful you've made Belly's story part of your summers."We put our hearts into this and we're so thankful to you for coming along with us for the ride. Maybe we'll meet again one summer in Cousins."Until then - all of my love always, Jenny."Radio Times said fans would lap up a follow-up, writing: "While the ending was satisfying and closed the central question of the show, fans undoubtedly want to see happily-in-love Belly and Conrad – and what happens next not just for them, but for Jeremiah and his new flame, as well as Steven and Taylor."BBC News used AI to help write the summary at the top of this article.
