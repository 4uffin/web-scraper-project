Thick clouds of smoke can be seen as Israeli forces fire artillery shells and smoke bombs to cover their advance.The Sheikh Radwan district was home to tens of thousands of people before the war and is considered one of the city's most densely populated areas.Israel says the aim of its Gaza City offensive is to free hostages held by Hamas and defeat up to 3,000 fighters in what it describes as the group's "last stronghold" - but the operation has drawn widespread international condemnation.The leaders of more than 20 major aid agencies, including Save the Children and Oxfam, warned that "the inhumanity of the situation in Gaza is unconscionable".Residents in Sheikh Radwan said Wednesday's incursion followed a wave of heavy airstrikes targeting buildings and main streets across the neighbourhood, in what appeared to be preparation for the ground assault.Saad Hamada, a local resident who fled south with his family earlier on Wednesday, told the BBC: "The drones didn't leave anything. They hit solar panels, power generators, water tanks, even the internet network."Life became impossible, and that is what forced most people to leave despite the danger."ReutersThe incursion into Sheikh Radwan has triggered yet another wave of displacement, with thousands of families fleeing southSheikh Radwan includes the areas of Abu Iskandar, al-Tawam, and al-Saftawi, and is intersected by al-Jalaa Street, a vital artery linking central Gaza City with its northern districts.Locals say Israeli control of the neighbourhood could open the way for forces to advance deeper into the city and reach its central areas.The images of tanks in Gaza City's streets have caused widespread panic among residents, particularly those still living in the western and central parts of the city.Witnesses said the sight of tanks approaching their homes revived memories of previous incursions, that ended with entire neighbourhoods being flattened.The incursion into Sheikh Radwan has triggered yet another wave of displacement, with thousands of families fleeing south.Long lines of cars and carts loaded with belongings were seen on the roads, as the Israeli army opened a route to the south via the Salahedin Road. Residents reported journeys taking hours and costing hundreds of shekels due to the scarcity of transport and soaring prices.Getty ImagesThe Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood has already suffered massive damage in the warBefore the war, Sheikh Radwan was one of Gaza City's busiest districts, home to dozens of schools, mosques, and marketplaces.It had already been struck repeatedly by air raids in recent months, and there is widespread destruction, but the sight of tanks inside the area now marks a significant new phase in Israel's ground campaign.Israel launches ground offensive on Gaza CityThousands of Palestinians flee as Israeli troops push into Gaza CityThe frantic race to save historic treasures from Israeli bombsThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) announced on Wednesday morning that it had struck more than 150 targets across Gaza City in two days in support of its ground troops.As part of its operations, the IDF is also reportedly utilising old military vehicles loaded with explosives that have been modified to be controlled remotely. They are being driven to Hamas positions and detonated, according to Israeli media.Resident Nidal al-Sherbi told the BBC Arabic's Middle East Daily programme: "Last night was extremely difficult, with continuous explosions and shelling that lasted from night until dawn.""Israeli vehicles advanced from Sheikh Radwan, Tal al-Hawa, and also from Shejaiya. It was a very, very frightening night."Aid groups, UN agencies and others say the "humanitarian area" people are expected to move to is heavily overcrowded and insufficient to support the roughly two million Palestinians who are expected to cram into it.Some who followed the military's orders to evacuate to the zone say they found no space to pitch their tents,
so they returned north."Everyday leaflets are thrown at us ordering evacuation, while the Israeli army shells buildings in every direction," Munir Azzam, who is in northern Gaza, told the BBC. "But where can we go? We have no refuge in the south."The IDF said on Tuesday that around 350,000 people had fled Gaza City, while the UN put the figure at 190,000 since August. Estimates suggest at least 650,000 remain.Daniel Meron, Israel's ambassador to the UN, says Israel "categorically rejects the libellous rant"Israel launched its war in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.At least 65,062 people have been killed in Israeli attacks since then, almost half of them women and children, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.It said on Wednesday that 98 people had been killed and 385 injured by Israeli fire in the past 24 hours. Another four people had died from malnutrition, taking the total number of malnutrition-related deaths since a UN-backed body declared famine in Gaza City in late August to 154, it added.The UN has warned that an intensification of the offensive will push civilians into "even deeper catastrophe".On Tuesday, a UN commission of inquiry said Israel has committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. Israel's foreign ministry rejected the report and denounced it as "distorted and false".More on the Israel-Gaza war'The bombing has been insane': Palestinians scramble to flee Israeli assault on Gaza CityIsrael has committed genocide in Gaza, UN commission of inquiry saysBowen: UN commission report on genocide is blunt indictment of Israel's actions in GazaIsrael & the PalestiniansIsrael-Gaza warIsraelHamasRelatedTrump says he 'will not allow' Netanyahu to annex West BankPalestinian president says ready to work with Trump for two-state peace planBBC and news agencies launch film calling on Israel to allow foreign journalists into GazaMore from the BBC6 hrs agoMicrosoft cuts off some services used by Israeli military unitThe tech giant said its products were not intended to be used for mass surveillance of civilians. 6 hrs ago9 hrs agoIsraeli strike on Yemen's Houthis reportedly kills eightThe Israeli military says its "most powerful strike" in Yemen targeted security and military targets, but the Houthis say civilian facilities were hit.9 hrs ago16 hrs agoPalestinians in West Bank stranded as Israel shuts only international crossingMany have been unable to leave the territory since the Allenby Bridge crossing was shut indefinitely on Wednesday.16 hrs ago23 hrs agoPlea for help as donkeys suffer in Israel and GazaThe Haywards Heath charity is marking its 25th anniversary with a nationwide fundraising challenge.23 hrs ago1 day agoIsraeli strikes kill dozens in Gaza City, hospitals say, as offensive expandsWomen and children were among 20 people who died when a strike hit a building sheltering displaced families, first responders say.1 day agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseSubscription TermsAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
