The family said they had receieved no further updates from the police."It's about accountability," said Paul, adding: "We can't move on."Da Nang City Police has been asked to comment.Paul OttesonArno (left), pictured with Paul, Susan and Greta, in Vietnam in November 2024Greta had been living in Hoi An with Arno, her South African partner of about two years, where the couple ran a villa renting out rooms to travellers.She was an only child, described by her father as "marvellous", a "free spirit" and a "hard worker" who studied in Cardiff, Paris and Los Angeles.In November 2024, Paul, 71 and Susan, 70, had travelled to Vietnam, meeting Arno for the first time, and the couple announced their engagement shortly afterwards."It was lovely - we were so happy," said Paul, who described Arno as "quiet but highly intelligent" and someone he "would have loved to have as a son in law".Arno QuintonArno Quinton and Greta Otteson were found dead after drinking limoncello made with methanolDuring their stay, the family ate a number of times at Good Morning Vietnam, a well known Italian restaurant, where they enjoyed the food and received free shots of homemade limoncello at the end.A few weeks later, when Paul and Susan had left Vietnam and were trying to think of a Christmas gift for Greta and Arno, they remembered the restaurant and its bottles of limoncello and decided to order a few of them for delivery to their daughter's house.It was a decision that would have the most devastating consequences.Paul OttesonGreta and Arno ran a holiday villa in the coastal city of Hoi AnWithin hours of drinking the limoncello, Greta messaged her parents on Christmas Day to say she had a terrible hangover and was seeing black spots but brushed off suggestions from them, and a friend who had visited, to get medical help.Greta and Arno were found dead in separate rooms of the villa on Boxing Day. It was not long before post-mortem examinations revealed that the couple had died from severe methanol poisoning.Quang Nam Provincial PoliceVietnamese police investigate the couple's apartmentIn February, police arrested a barman who worked in a restaurant in Hoi An for "violating regulations on food safety" by "using used 70-degree medical grade alcohol, along with filtered water, lemon peel and white sugar to create two bottles of limoncello".According to the Vietnamese central government, the offence could carry a maximum prison term of seven to 15 years.Methanol is a type of alcohol commonly found in cleaning products, fuel and antifreeze. It is similar to ethanol, which is used for alcoholic drinks, but it is cheaper and more toxic to humans because of the way it is processed by the body.Hundreds of people are poisoned by methanol every year in South East Asia, according to the charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF).Greta and Arno's deaths came just weeks after six people died of methanol poisoning in Laos, a country which neighbours Vietnam.Paul and Susan feel they cannot put Greta and Arno's ashes to rest until they have answersIn the Otteson's home in Rhandirmwyn, Carmarthenshire, two square bags sit next to the stairs - one has a pink bunny sitting on top, the other, a blue teddy.They hold Greta and Arno's ashes."They sit in the lounge with us," said Mr Otteson, a retired project manager. "We want to put them to rest, but we feel we can't do that until we get a proper conclusion."Paul and Susan were warned investigations take a long time in Vietnam, with the possibility of a suspect being held for a year before being charged or released.They said the wait for answers was becoming unbearable.Getty ImagesHoi An, where Greta and Arno were living, is a coastal city in Vietnam which is popular with tourists"We just want justice," said Paul. "We can't move on. Susan's asking me every morning when we wake up, 'is there any news? Is there any news?' I have to say 'no, nothing yet'.""It's about accountability," he added."Justice for us would be naming the people responsible and prosecuting them."The couple said they also felt "very upset" the restaurant where they had ordered the limoncello was still open and had not publicly apologised."They just carried on as if nothing has happened," said Paul.Good Morning Vietnam did not respond to requests for comment from BBC News.Paul and Susan Otteson say they are fighting for justice for Greta and ArnoFor Paul and Susan, the pain is still very raw. Paul becomes emotional talking of his regret that they will never have grandchildren and that Arno will never come to Wales."Everything that we've worked for over 40 years, it was all for Greta and Arno eventually, but now it's meaningless," he said.Once the police investigation is concluded, Greta and Arno will finally be laid to rest.The location is undecided, but the family said they would always be together.Foreign Office minister Seema Malhotra said she was "deeply saddened" by the case and that her thoughts were with the family."We know that methanol poisoning and counterfeit alcohol pose a serious, life-threatening risk to British travellers in some parts of the word. This is a deeply concerning issue and we are committed to helping keep people safe," she said."We are tackling this issue head-on, working with local authorities and over 150 travel industry partners to raise awareness of the dangers of methanol poisoning."Additional reporting by Gareth BryerBritish woman and fiance found dead in Vietnam villaWhat is methanol and how does it affect the body?'Don't let it be your best friend that dies from methanol poisoning'Free shots and beer buckets in party town at centre of suspected methanol deathsWalesVietnamLlandoveryRelatedStrictly's Amy put 'strain' on herself to return to dancing after cancerFamilies 'bin £90 of food a month' as black bag limits loomWales' papers: Man denies murder and baby dies in car tragedyMore from the BBC25 Aug 2025'It's terrifying': Thousands evacuate as typhoon batters VietnamIt comes less than a year after Vietnam was hit by Typhoon Yagi, which killed 300 people.25 Aug 202524 Aug 2025More than 500,000 ordered to evacuate as typhoon heads for VietnamTyphoon Kajiki is brushing past Hainan in China before heading for Vietnam, forecasters say.24 Aug 20252 Aug 2025Town's 160-year wait to be recognised as birthplace of Welsh rugbyThe Welsh Rugby Union officially recognises Llandovery as the joint birthplace of Welsh rugby.2 Aug 202523 Jul 2025Cannabis farmer caught with £96k plant haulVietnamese national Vu Nguyen arrived in the UK illegally five years ago, a court hears.23 Jul 202520 Jul 2025Dozens dead after Ha Long Bay tourist boat capsizes in VietnamThe incident happened in Vietnam's popular Ha Long Bay during bad weather, with several people still missing.20 Jul 2025British Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
