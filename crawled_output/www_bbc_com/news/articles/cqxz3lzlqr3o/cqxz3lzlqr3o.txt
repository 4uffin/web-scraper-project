Kastrup airport in Copenhagen was forced to shut for several hours from around 20:30 (18:30 GMT) on Monday following the sighting of a number of drones. "It says something about the times we live in and what we as a society must be prepared to deal with," Frederiksen told reporters.Russian involvement could not be ruled out, Frederiksen added - although Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called the allegations "unfounded". The Danish PM made a link between last night's events in Denmark and the recent Russian drone incursions in Poland and Romania, as well as the violation of Estonian airspace by Russian fighter jets.Frederiksen said that the motive for the incursion in Copenhagen had likely been to "disrupt, create unrest... to see how far you can go and test the limits."Danish intelligence mirrored this assessment, saying the country was facing a "high threat of sabotage"."Someone may not necessarily want to attack us, but rather stress us out and see how we react," said Flemming Drejer, director of operations at Denmark's intelligence service PET.In nearby Norway, Oslo airport too was closed for a period after possible drone sightings. Around 20,000 passengers were impacted by the closure of Copenhagen airport, which resumed operations after midnight local time.Earlier on Tuesday Danish police stated they did not know who was behind the drones, but that evidence suggested it was a "capable actor."A number of large drones which had come from different directions "quite a long way away" had been observed at Copenhagen airport, said police Inspector Jens Jespersen. He added the drones, which turned their lights on and off as they approached the airport, had been operated by someone who had the "will and tools to show off... perhaps also to practise."Police did not shoot down the drones because the airport is located in a densely built-up area and because there were planes in the air, Insp Jespersen told reporters. In a post on social media Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky referenced "Russia's violation" of Nato airspace in Copenhagen on 22 September.
Insp Jespersen refused to comment on Zelensky's allegations. "It's not because I don't want to, it's because I simply don't know," he said.The Norwegian Police Security Service said it was working to clarify whether the
unconfirmed drone sighting at Oslo airport could be related to the drones observed in Denmark.Oslo airport was closed between 00:30 and 03:30 and fourteen flights had to be diverted. Norway's government said Russia has violated Norwegian airspace three times in 2025 - in April, July and August - adding that it was unclear if this was deliberate or the result of navigation errors. "Regardless of the cause, this is not acceptable," Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store said.Tensions have been escalating recently after Russian drones and aircraft ventured into central and eastern European airspace, three and a half years after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.Earlier in September at least three Russian drones were shot down by Polish and other Nato aircraft in Poland's airspace. Moscow denied it had been trying to target facilities on Polish soil. A similar incident occurred in Romania only a few days later when a drone flew into Romanian airspace before disappearing from the radar.And on Saturday three Russian MiG-31 fighter jets entered Estonian skies and remained there for 12 minutes, leading Nato jets to be scrambled. The incursions were part of a "wider pattern of increasingly irresponsible Russian behaviour," Nato said in a statement on Tuesday. In recent days Poland stated it would shoot down any objects that violated its airspace, while Sweden promised to do the same if it spotted any Russian aircraft in its skies.In response to Russia's incursions into Poland and Romania, Nato has pledged to move troops and fighter jets eastwards.Planes from the UK, France, Germany and Denmark are taking part in air defence missions over Poland in a bid to bolster the alliance's eastern flank.How Russia is quietly trying to win over the world beyond the WestRussia may attack Nato in next four years, German defence chief warnsUK jets to defend Polish skies after Russian drone incursionWar in UkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyDenmarkRussiaDronesRelatedTrump urges Turkey to stop buying Russian oil as Erdogan chases deal on F-35sRussia will expand aggression beyond Ukraine if not stopped, Zelensky warns Rosenberg: Russia brushes off Trump's claim of 'paper tiger' in aimless warMore from the BBC5 mins agoDrone attacks leave Denmark exposed - and searching for responseIn an era of hybrid warfare, there is a sense of embarrassment that Denmark's critical infrastructure has become vulnerable.5 mins ago16 hrs agoCharity bans drone launches from sculpture siteThe steel structure is next to the A46 in Norton Disney, a village between Newark and Lincoln.16 hrs ago17 hrs agoDenmark says 'professional actor' behind drone incursions over its airportsBut the defence minister says there is no evidence of Russian involvement after the latest incident.17 hrs ago22 hrs agoWoman in Spanish cold case identified after 20 yearsRussian citizen Liudmila Zavada, 31, was found dead in July 2005 by a road in the northeastern Spain.22 hrs ago1 day agoThe sun sets on India's iconic and controversial Soviet fighter jetMiG-21 served in all conflicts with Pakistan since 1965 and was later known for a high crash rate.1 day agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseSubscription TermsAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
