Yet the economic impact of ending tariff preferences would be limited. Trade commissioner Maroš Šefčovič estimated the effect at just €227m a year.The only measure that takes immediate effect is the suspension of bilateral support to the Israeli government. But this too is largely symbolic with a mere €9.4m out of €14m allocated for 2020–24 – and does not require approval from member states.Mediterranean Commissioner Dubravka Šuica stressed that funding for programmes tackling antisemitism and supporting civil society would not be affected.Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar dismissed the Commission's proposals as "morally and politically distorted", warning on X that actions against Israel would damage Europe's own interests and vowing that any steps taken against his country would be answered "in kind."It's not immediately clear when the measures will be voted on by members.Spanish PM calls for Israel to be barred from international sportIsrael has committed genocide in Gaza, UN commission of inquiry saysDoes Israel face a 'South Africa moment' over Gaza?'The bombing has been insane': Palestinians scramble to flee Israeli assault on Gaza CityIsrael & the PalestiniansIsrael-Gaza warIsraelEconomic sanctionsEuropean CommissionRelatedBBC and news agencies launch film calling on Israel to allow foreign journalists into GazaKilled seeking food - Jeremy Bowen on Abdullah's shooting and Gaza's lethal aid systemRecognition of statehood 'rewards Palestinian people' says Iraqi presidentMore from the BBC3 hrs agoIsraeli strikes kill dozens in Gaza City, hospitals say, as offensive expandsWomen and children were among 20 people who died when a strike hit a building sheltering displaced families, first responders say.3 hrs ago6 hrs agoTwenty injured in Yemen drone attack on Israel, rescuers and military sayTwo have been taken to hospital with serious shrapnel injuries, the Magen David Adom ambulance service says.6 hrs ago9 hrs agoItaly condemns 'drone attack' on Gaza aid flotilla and deploys frigateItaly's defence minister directs a navy vessel to assist the flotilla's boats after what he says was a drone attack by unidentified perpetrators off Crete.9 hrs ago9 hrs agoIsraeli forces near Gaza City centre as Hamas reportedly prepares for street-to-street fightingThousands of Palestinians have been forced to flee Gaza City since Israel launched its ground offensive last week.9 hrs ago11 hrs agoHow will the EU's new border system work?
