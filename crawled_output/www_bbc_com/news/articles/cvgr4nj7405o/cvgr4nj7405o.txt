Yet the economic impact of ending tariff preferences would be limited. Trade commissioner Maroš Šefčovič estimated the effect at just €227m a year.The only measure that takes immediate effect is the suspension of bilateral support to the Israeli government. But this too is largely symbolic with a mere €9.4m out of €14m allocated for 2020–24 – and does not require approval from member states.Mediterranean Commissioner Dubravka Šuica stressed that funding for programmes tackling antisemitism and supporting civil society would not be affected.Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar dismissed the Commission's proposals as "morally and politically distorted", warning on X that actions against Israel would damage Europe's own interests and vowing that any steps taken against his country would be answered "in kind."It's not immediately clear when the measures will be voted on by members.Spanish PM calls for Israel to be barred from international sportIsrael has committed genocide in Gaza, UN commission of inquiry saysDoes Israel face a 'South Africa moment' over Gaza?'The bombing has been insane': Palestinians scramble to flee Israeli assault on Gaza CityIsrael & the PalestiniansIsrael-Gaza warIsraelEconomic sanctionsEuropean CommissionRelatedOne hellscape to another: Gazans tell of dire conditions in Israeli-declared humanitarian zoneUS blocks UN call for Gaza ceasefire for sixth timeJudge gives reasons for banning pro-Palestinian protestsMore from the BBC10 hrs agoFirst students evacuated from Gaza to study in UKThe group includes at least four medical doctors who have places to study at UK universities. 10 hrs ago11 hrs agoTogether for Palestine fundraiser edges closer to £2m targetThe event, described by organisers as the biggest of its kind in the UK, was watched live by 200,000.11 hrs ago15 hrs agoWhat does recognising a Palestinian state mean?Several countries are expected to officially recognise a Palestinian state in the coming days.15 hrs ago1 day agoTwo shot dead in attack near West Bank-Jordan crossing, Israeli military saysThe army says the attacker was driving a truck transporting humanitarian aid from Jordan.1 day ago1 day agoIsraeli air strikes hit southern LebanonIsrael said it was targeting Hezbollah positions, while Lebanon's PM called for pressure on Israel to stop attacks.1 day agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
