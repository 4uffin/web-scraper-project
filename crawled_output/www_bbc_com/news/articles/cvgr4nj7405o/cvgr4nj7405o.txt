Yet the economic impact of ending tariff preferences would be limited. Trade commissioner Maroš Šefčovič estimated the effect at just €227m a year.The only measure that takes immediate effect is the suspension of bilateral support to the Israeli government. But this too is largely symbolic with a mere €9.4m out of €14m allocated for 2020–24 – and does not require approval from member states.Mediterranean Commissioner Dubravka Šuica stressed that funding for programmes tackling antisemitism and supporting civil society would not be affected.Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar dismissed the Commission's proposals as "morally and politically distorted", warning on X that actions against Israel would damage Europe's own interests and vowing that any steps taken against his country would be answered "in kind."It's not immediately clear when the measures will be voted on by members.Spanish PM calls for Israel to be barred from international sportIsrael has committed genocide in Gaza, UN commission of inquiry saysDoes Israel face a 'South Africa moment' over Gaza?'The bombing has been insane': Palestinians scramble to flee Israeli assault on Gaza CityIsrael & the PalestiniansIsrael-Gaza warIsraelEconomic sanctionsEuropean CommissionRelatedJudge gives reasons for banning pro-Palestinian protestsGenocide happening in Gaza, Sir Sadiq Khan saysIsraeli tanks push into major Gaza City residential areaMore from the BBC6 hrs agoTwo shot dead in attack near West Bank-Jordan crossing, Israeli military saysThe army says the attacker was driving a truck transporting humanitarian aid from Jordan.6 hrs ago7 hrs agoIsraeli air strikes hit southern LebanonIsrael said it was targeting Hezbollah positions, while Lebanon's PM called for pressure on Israel to stop attacks.7 hrs ago10 hrs ago'Cataclysmic' situation in Gaza City, UN official says, as Israeli tanks advanceA constant of stream of Palestinians flee southwards as Israeli tanks reportedly push further into Gaza's biggest urban centre.10 hrs ago13 hrs agoIsraeli minister touts Gaza 'real estate bonanza', defying international backlashBezalel Smotrich, an ultranationalist who has been sanctioned by the UK and others, said he was in discussion with the US over the idea. 13 hrs ago20 hrs agoUS judge orders deportation of Palestinian activist Mahmoud KhalilAn immigration judge ordered Khalil be deported to Algeria or Syria over claims he omitted information on a green card application. 20 hrs agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
