Yet the economic impact of ending tariff preferences would be limited. Trade commissioner Maroš Šefčovič estimated the effect at just €227m a year.The only measure that takes immediate effect is the suspension of bilateral support to the Israeli government. But this too is largely symbolic with a mere €9.4m out of €14m allocated for 2020–24 – and does not require approval from member states.Mediterranean Commissioner Dubravka Šuica stressed that funding for programmes tackling antisemitism and supporting civil society would not be affected.Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar dismissed the Commission's proposals as "morally and politically distorted", warning on X that actions against Israel would damage Europe's own interests and vowing that any steps taken against his country would be answered "in kind."It's not immediately clear when the measures will be voted on by members.Spanish PM calls for Israel to be barred from international sportIsrael has committed genocide in Gaza, UN commission of inquiry saysDoes Israel face a 'South Africa moment' over Gaza?'The bombing has been insane': Palestinians scramble to flee Israeli assault on Gaza CityIsrael & the PalestiniansIsrael-Gaza warIsraelEconomic sanctionsEuropean CommissionRelatedWhy Starmer decided the time was right to recognise a Palestinian statePortugal confirms it will recognise Palestinian stateOne hellscape to another: Gazans tell of dire conditions in Israeli-declared humanitarian zoneMore from the BBC4 hrs agoStarmer set to announce UK recognition of Palestinian state on SundayA host of countries, including France and Canada, are expected to do the same when world leaders gather at the UN General Assembly next week.4 hrs ago1 day agoFirst students evacuated from Gaza to study in UKThe group includes at least four medical doctors who have places to study at UK universities. 1 day ago1 day agoTogether for Palestine fundraiser edges closer to £2m targetThe event, described by organisers as the biggest of its kind in the UK, was watched live by 200,000.1 day ago2 days agoWhat does recognising a Palestinian state mean?Several countries are expected to officially recognise a Palestinian state in the coming days.2 days ago2 days agoUS blocks UN call for Gaza ceasefire for sixth timeWashington's representative says the Security Council resolution does not go far enough in condemning Hamas.2 days agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
