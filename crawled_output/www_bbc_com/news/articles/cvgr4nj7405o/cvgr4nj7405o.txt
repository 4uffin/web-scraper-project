Yet the economic impact of ending tariff preferences would be limited. Trade commissioner Maroš Šefčovič estimated the effect at just €227m a year.The only measure that takes immediate effect is the suspension of bilateral support to the Israeli government. But this too is largely symbolic with a mere €9.4m out of €14m allocated for 2020–24 – and does not require approval from member states.Mediterranean Commissioner Dubravka Šuica stressed that funding for programmes tackling antisemitism and supporting civil society would not be affected.Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar dismissed the Commission's proposals as "morally and politically distorted", warning on X that actions against Israel would damage Europe's own interests and vowing that any steps taken against his country would be answered "in kind."It's not immediately clear when the measures will be voted on by members.Spanish PM calls for Israel to be barred from international sportIsrael has committed genocide in Gaza, UN commission of inquiry saysDoes Israel face a 'South Africa moment' over Gaza?'The bombing has been insane': Palestinians scramble to flee Israeli assault on Gaza CityIsrael & the PalestiniansIsrael-Gaza warIsraelEconomic sanctionsEuropean CommissionRelatedUK rewarding Hamas, says mother of freed British-Israeli hostageWatch: Keir Starmer says UK recognises Palestinian stateCanada first G7 nation to recognise Palestinian state More from the BBC5 hrs agoUK formally recognises Palestinian stateCanada, Australia and Portugal also announced the move on Sunday, with Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu accusing leaders of giving a "huge reward to terrorism".5 hrs ago12 hrs agoIn full: Statement announcing UK's recognition of Palestinian stateA complete transcription of Sir Keir Starmer's video announcement on Palestinian statehood.12 hrs ago12 hrs agoWhat does recognising a Palestinian state mean?The UK, Australia and Canada have recognised a Palestinian state, while France and other countries are set to do so in the coming days.12 hrs ago14 hrs agoCharities attack ban on Gaza students bringing families to UKSome students say they will have to give up their university places rather than leave family in Gaza.14 hrs ago20 hrs agoIsrael will occupy more West Bank land, but recognition matters, mayor tells BBCPalestinians living in the West Bank describe the impact of Israel's occupying control.20 hrs agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
