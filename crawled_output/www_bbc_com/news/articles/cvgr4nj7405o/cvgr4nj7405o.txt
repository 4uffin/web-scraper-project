Yet the economic impact of ending tariff preferences would be limited. Trade commissioner Maroš Šefčovič estimated the effect at just €227m a year.The only measure that takes immediate effect is the suspension of bilateral support to the Israeli government. But this too is largely symbolic with a mere €9.4m out of €14m allocated for 2020–24 – and does not require approval from member states.Mediterranean Commissioner Dubravka Šuica stressed that funding for programmes tackling antisemitism and supporting civil society would not be affected.Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar dismissed the Commission's proposals as "morally and politically distorted", warning on X that actions against Israel would damage Europe's own interests and vowing that any steps taken against his country would be answered "in kind."It's not immediately clear when the measures will be voted on by members.Spanish PM calls for Israel to be barred from international sportIsrael has committed genocide in Gaza, UN commission of inquiry saysDoes Israel face a 'South Africa moment' over Gaza?'The bombing has been insane': Palestinians scramble to flee Israeli assault on Gaza CityIsrael & the PalestiniansIsrael-Gaza warIsraelEconomic sanctionsEuropean CommissionRelatedHow the simmering row over freedom of speech reached boiling pointFrance formally recognises Palestinian state Footage shows public executions in Gaza City streetMore from the BBC3 hrs agoTaoiseach criticises presidential candidate for 'justifying' HamasThe candidate says Hamas is "part of the fabric of the Palestinian people" and it is "not up to" Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer to decide.3 hrs ago7 hrs agoClashes break out as Italians strike demanding action over GazaTens of thousands turn out and tensions erupt around Milan's main station where 60 police are reported hurt.7 hrs ago8 hrs ago'Don't sell your soul' to sip champagne with Trump, says O'NeillO'Neill did not attend a state banquet with President Trump but Little-Pengelly was among the guests.8 hrs ago14 hrs agoUK says Israel must not retaliate against Palestinian statehood pushYvette Cooper spoke to the BBC as France and more countries prepare to follow the UK and recognise Palestinian statehood.14 hrs ago16 hrs agoWhat does recognising a Palestinian state mean?The UK, Australia and Canada have recognised a Palestinian state, while France and other countries are set to do so in the coming days.16 hrs agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
