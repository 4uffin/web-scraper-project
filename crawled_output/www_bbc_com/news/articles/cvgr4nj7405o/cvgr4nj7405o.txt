Yet the economic impact of ending tariff preferences would be limited. Trade commissioner Maroš Šefčovič estimated the effect at just €227m a year.The only measure that takes immediate effect is the suspension of bilateral support to the Israeli government. But this too is largely symbolic with a mere €9.4m out of €14m allocated for 2020–24 – and does not require approval from member states.Mediterranean Commissioner Dubravka Šuica stressed that funding for programmes tackling antisemitism and supporting civil society would not be affected.Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar dismissed the Commission's proposals as "morally and politically distorted", warning on X that actions against Israel would damage Europe's own interests and vowing that any steps taken against his country would be answered "in kind."It's not immediately clear when the measures will be voted on by members.Spanish PM calls for Israel to be barred from international sportIsrael has committed genocide in Gaza, UN commission of inquiry saysDoes Israel face a 'South Africa moment' over Gaza?'The bombing has been insane': Palestinians scramble to flee Israeli assault on Gaza CityIsrael & the PalestiniansIsrael-Gaza warIsraelEconomic sanctionsEuropean CommissionRelatedWhat is Hamas and why is it fighting with Israel in Gaza?Israel and the Palestinians: History of the conflict explainedEuropean recognition of Palestinian state shows US still only power that countsMore from the BBCJust nowThree students from Gaza arrive in NI to study, minister says They are among a group of 34 students that arrived in the UK in recent days.Just now53 mins agoIrish presidential candidate condemns Hamas and Israel She says both have committed war crimes after her previous comments were criticised 53 mins ago9 hrs agoPolice officer charged with assault at pro-Palestinian protest in SydneyHannah Thomas says she was punched in the eye during a scuffle with police in June.9 hrs ago12 hrs agoTrump to address UN General Assembly after France recognises Palestinian stateDonald Trump will address UN leaders on Tuesday, as more European countries look set to join the French policy change.12 hrs ago16 hrs agoTaoiseach criticises presidential candidate for 'justifying' HamasThe candidate says Hamas is "part of the fabric of the Palestinian people" and it is "not up to" Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer to decide.16 hrs agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
