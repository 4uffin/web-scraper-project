Mr Nadella conceded that "all tech things are about booms and busts and bubbles" and warned that AI should not be "over-hyped or under-hyped".He acknowledged that its energy consumption remains "very high" but argued that its potential benefits, especially in the fields of healthcare, public services, and business productivity, were worthwhile. Meanwhile, when asked about the massive energy resources required to power AI, Mr Huang said solar power would contribute, and he was hoping for more gas turbines in the short term that could be put "off the grid so we don't burden people on the grid". He added that AI itself would design better gas turbines, solar panels, wind turbines and fusion energy to produce more cost-effective sustainable energy.The campaign group Foxglove has warned that the UK could end up "footing the bill for the colossal amounts of power the giants need".The supercomputer, to be built in Loughton, Essex, was already announced by the government in January, but Microsoft has now come on board to the project.Big tech comes to townMr Nadella was speaking exclusively to BBC News as Donald Trump arrived in the UK on a three-day state visit.The Tech Prosperity Deal between the two countries seeks to strengthen ties on AI, quantum computing and nuclear power.Questions have been asked about what if anything the UK has agreed to give in return.Technology Secretary Liz Kendall told the BBC the deal did not include guarantees over scrapping a tax for big tech or on copyright for AI companies.The Digital Services Tax - a 2% levy which raises about £800m a year mainly from US tech companies - was previously said to be part of trade discussions.But Ms Kendall told the Today programme "that wasn't part of the partnership" now agreed.She also said no guarantees were made to AI companies on copyright, a major issue for the UK's creative sector - which has expressed concerns its work is being used by AI companies without permission.Meanwhile, a number of other tech companies have pledged billions of pounds in investment alongside Microsoft and Nvidia.Google has promised £5bn for AI research and infrastructure over the next two years.Tech leaders including Nadella, Huang and OpenAI boss Sam Altman will accompany Trump to a state banquet hosted by the Royal Family at Windsor Castle on Wednesday evening.AI growth zone in north-east EnglandThe government also said there was "potential for more than 5,000 jobs and billions in private investment" in north-east England, which has been designated as a new "AI growth zone".It has announced a data centre project at Cobalt Park, Northumberland - dubbed Stargate UK - from OpenAI, Nvidia, Nscale and semiconductor company Arm.However the UK version is much smaller than OpenAI's US-based Stargate project, launched in January with a commitment to invest $500bn (£367bn) over the next four years building new AI infrastructure.The Tony Blair Institute described the news as a "breakthrough moment" but added Britain had some work to do.Dr Keegan McBride, an emerging tech and geopolitics expert at the institute, said that work included "reforming planning rules, accelerating the delivery of clean energy projects, and building the necessary digital infrastructure" for growth.The Conservative Party highlighted that other big international companies such as the pharmaceutical giant Merck have recently cancelled or delayed their UK expansion plans.Additional reporting by Imran Rahman-Jones and Philippa Wain.Nvidia boss 'disappointed' by reported China chip banData centres to be expanded across UK as concerns mountGoogle owner reveals £5bn AI investment in UK ahead of Trump visitSign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter to follow the world's top tech stories and trends.
