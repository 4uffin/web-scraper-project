Nexstar and Sinclair, which together run dozens of stations affiliated to ABC, said they would continue to replace the show with regular programming on Tuesday. "Mr Kimmel's remarks were inappropriate and deeply insensitive at a critical moment for our country," Sinclair's vice-chairman Jason Smith said.The liberal comedian's show was yanked off air last week after his monologue about the shooting of Kirk caused uproar.Nextstar, one of the biggest owners of TV stations in the US, said in a statement on Tuesday: "We made a decision last week to preempt 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' following what ABC referred to as Mr Kimmel's 'ill-timed and insensitive' comments at a critical time in our national discourse. "We stand by that decision pending assurance that all parties are committed to fostering an environment of respectful, constructive dialogue in the markets we serve."Nexstar is currently trying to close a $6.2 billion deal to acquire its rival Tegna, which would require a green light from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the US broadcasting regulator.Watch: Jimmy Kimmel supporters and critics react to his TV returnEarlier on Monday, Sinclair said it would be "preempting Jimmy Kimmel Live! across our ABC affiliate stations and replacing it with news programming"."Discussions with ABC are ongoing as we evaluate the show's potential return," it said in a statement. Nexstar and Sinclair together control more than 20% of ABC's affiliated television stations, according to the New York Times. Jimmy Kimmel posted online for the first time since being taken off the air, sharing an image on Instagram of him with the late TV writer and activist Norman Lear. Lear, who created the sitcoms All in the Family, The Jeffersons and Maude, was known for taking on societal issues in his shows.
