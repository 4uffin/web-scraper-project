there is a nuclear testing site about 2,000km (1,243 miles) away, in north-western China.Trump has also repeatedly said that China has since established a presence at the base, which is north of the capital, Kabul. The Taliban have denied the claim.But a BBC investigation - which examined 30 satellite images from late 2020 to 2025 - found very little activity at the base since the Taliban returned, and no evidence to support China's presence at the base.On Friday, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said "China respects Afghanistan's territorial integrity and sovereignty", adding that "the future of Afghanistan should be in the hands of Afghan people".The Taliban's Zakir Jalal, meanwhile, wrote on social media platform X: "Throughout history, Afghans have not accepted a military presence, and this possibility was completely rejected during the Doha talks and agreement, but the doors are open to other engagement."The US and the Taliban have been involved in talks recently, although a meeting on Saturday with the Taliban's foreign minister focused on Americans held in Afghanistan, news agency Reuters reported.In pictures: Two decades of the US at Bagram base'My wife died giving birth after Trump cut funding to our clinic'US deal paved way for Afghan collapse - generalsWar in Afghanistan (2001-2021)AfghanistanChinaTalibanDonald TrumpUnited StatesRelatedDaring Apache rescue mission retoldGovernment unable to calculate Afghan data breach cost, watchdog saysMy family may be killed if deported, says son of Afghan caught in UK data breachMore from the BBC2 hrs agoCharlie Kirk, the conservative influencer who became the voice of MAGA youthKirk, an influential Trump ally who at age 18 set up Turning Point USA, died in a shooting while speaking at a Utah campus event.2 hrs ago2 hrs agoHeightened security as Americans gather for Kirk memorial Donald Trump and JD Vance will be among the speakers at the event in Arizona.2 hrs ago3 hrs agoPress could lose Pentagon access for releasing 'unauthorised information'Journalists have been told Pentagon passes will be contingent on agreeing to new restrictions. 3 hrs ago6 hrs agoAsia Cup 2025Fixtures, results and scorecards from the 17th edition of the men's Asia Cup, to be played in the T20 format in the United Arab Emirates.6 hrs ago7 hrs agoIndia warns new US fee for H-1B visa will have 'humanitarian consequences'Donald Trump has said those applying for H-1B visas will have to pay $100,000, roughly 60 times the current fee,
