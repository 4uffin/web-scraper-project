In addition to a conviction, prosecutors will also seek "compensation for damages resulting from the criminal actions".Businessman Paulo Figueiredo, grandson of former dictator João Batista Figueiredo, has also been named in the charges.ReutersEduardo Bolsonaro relocated to the US earlier this year, and told the BBC he was living in "exile" out of fear of arrest should he return to Brazil.He has publicly lobbied for support for his father from the Trump administration, which likened the case against the former Brazilian president to a "witch hunt".US President Donald Trump, who sees Bolsonaro as an ally, imposed a 50% tariff on Brazil in July, a move that current Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva called "not only misguided but illogical".US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has vowed further action to pressure Brazil over the ex-president's conviction, and on Monday announced sanctions on the wife of Brazil's Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who presided over the former president's trial. The justice said the sanctions against his wife were "illegal and regrettable".Bolsonaro sentenced to 27 years in prison for plotting Brazil coupFrom political outsider to a president like no other: Bolsonaro's rise and fallJair Bolsonaro was found guilty of plotting a coup earlier this month and has been sentenced to 27 years in prison. Tens of thousands of Brazilians joined protests in cities across the country on Sunday to protest against a bill which could result in amnesty for the former president. Under the proposal, members of Congress would have to give their approval - in a secret ballot - before a lawmaker could be charged or arrested.Critics have dubbed it the "Banditry Bill" but members of Congress who supported it said it was necessary to shield them from what they said was "judicial overreach".President Lula wrote on X: "I stand with the Brazilian people. Today's demonstrations show that the population does not want impunity or amnesty."He has also vowed to veto the amnesty bill were it to be passed by the Senate.Jair BolsonaroBrazilRelatedThousands protest in Brazil against bill that could grant Bolsonaro amnestyI have no relationship with Trump, Brazil's President Lula tells BBCBrazil's Lula hits back at Trump over Bolsonaro trial and tariffsMore from the BBC8 days ago'Firenado' tears through Brazil sugarcane field‘Firenado’ forms as flames tear through sugarcane plantation in São Paulo8 days ago14 Sep 2025Hermeto Pascoal, 'the wizard' of Brazilian music, dies at 89Pascoal - famed for his blend of jazz and traditional music - wrote more than 2,000 instrumental pieces.14 Sep 202512 Sep 2025From political outsider to a president like no other: Bolsonaro's rise and fallThe Brazilian ex-president has been sentenced to 27 years for plotting a coup, but an amnesty could be on the cards.12 Sep 202512 Sep 2025What you need to know about Bolsonaro's coup prison sentenceThe former president of Brazil has been sentenced to 27 years in prison after being found guilty for plotting a military coup. 12 Sep 202512 Sep 2025Bolsonaro sentenced to 27 years in prison for plotting Brazil coupThe former president has been found guilty of trying to mount coup to cling to power after he lost the election. 12 Sep 2025British Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseSubscription TermsAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
