The late-night TV host made comments about the Charlie Kirk murder suspect, saying Trump supporters had tried to "characterise this kid as anything other than one of them".Kimmel's suspension following the threat of regulatory action has raised concerns the Trump administration was attempting to curtail the free speech of its critics - with other talk show hosts commenting on the row."This is blatant censorship," Stephen Colbert said on his rival CBS show. "With an autocrat, you can't give an inch."Watch: Ros Atkins on… What Jimmy Kimmel being taken off air means for free speech in the USIn his monologue on Monday, Kimmel, 57, had said the "Maga gang" - a reference to Trump supporters who rallied around his Make America Great Again election slogan - was "desperately trying to characterise this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them" and trying to "score political points from it". Officials in Utah, where Kirk was killed, have said he was "indoctrinated with leftist ideology".Kimmel also likened Trump's reaction to the death of his 31-year-old political confidant to "how a four-year-old mourns a goldfish".Kimmel has condemned the attack and sent "love" to the Kirk family in the immediate aftermath of the shooting.Trump spoke about the issue to reporters aboard Air Force One on Thursday while returning from a state visit to the UK."I have read some place that the networks were 97% against me, again, 97% negative, and yet I won and easily [in last year's election]," the president said."They give me only bad publicity [and] press. I mean, they're getting a licence. I would think maybe their licence should be taken away."The FCC's chair, Brendan Carr accused Kimmel of "the sickest conduct possible" and said firms like the Disney-owned ABC could "find ways to change conduct and take action... or there's going to be additional work for the FCC".FCC chair Carr told Fox on Thursday: "We're going to continue to hold these broadcasters accountable to the public interest - and if broadcasters don't like that simple solution, they can turn their licence in to the FCC."The FCC has regulatory power over major networks, such as ABC, as well as the local stations that carry their content. Owners of local stations can also influence major networks by refusing to carry shows.Kimmel's suspension was announced shortly after Nexstar Media, one of America's largest TV station owners, said it would not air his show "for the foreseeable future" as his remarks had been "offensive and insensitive".Carr praised Nexstar - which is currently seeking FCC approval for a $6.2bn (£4.5bn) merger with another media company, Tegna - and said he hoped other broadcasters would follow its lead. Sinclair, the largest ABC affiliate group in the US, said it would air a special remembrance programme dedicated to Kirk during the Jimmy Kimmel Live! time slot on Friday.Kirk died of a single gunshot wound to the neck while speaking at Utah Valley University on 10 September. A 22-year-old man was charged with aggravated murder on Tuesday. Prosecutors say he was "indoctrinated with leftist ideology" and that they will seek the death penalty. Legal scholars say the US Constitution's first amendment, which protects free speech, would prevent the FCC from revoking licences over political disagreements.But Joe Strazullo, a former Jimmy Kimmel Live! writer, told the BBC there was an atmosphere of fear in the writers' room."It's heartbreaking to see the threat of them being out of work," he said. "Nobody knows exactly what's going on still and they're working things out behind the scenes."Watch: How the Jimmy Kimmel saga has unfolded, so farWriters, actors and prominent Democrats have condemned Kimmel's suspension. Former US President Barrack Obama said the Trump administration had taken cancel culture to a "new and dangerous level by routinely threatening regulatory action against media companies unless they muzzle or fire reporters and commentators it doesn't like".Late-night show hosts have rallied around Kimmel.In a rare mid-week episode of The Daily Show, comedian Jon Stewart poked fun at the curtailing of free speech under the current administration.Stewart described himself as a "patriotically obedient host" and his programme as "administration-compliant". He then referred to Trump as "dear leader" who has been "gracing England with his legendary warmth and radiance". In a later segment of his show, Stewart interviewed Maria Ressa, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2021 for her fight for free speech and democracy in the Philippines under former President Rodrigo Duterte.What's happening in the US is "identical to what happened in the Philippines," Ressa said. "It's both deja vu and PTSD."She added: "Americans are like deer in headlights. If you don't move and protect the rights you have, you lose them, and it's so much harder to reclaim them," she said.Actor Ben Stiller said what happened to Kimmel "isn't right", while Hacks star Jean Smart said she was "horrified at the cancellation".The Writers Guild of America and Screen Actors Guild, two Hollywood trade unions, condemned the suspension of Kimmel as a violation of constitutional free speech rights.But others have maintained the FCC and ABC acted appropriately."When a person says something that a ton of people find offensive, rude, dumb in real time and then that person is punished for it, that's not cancel culture," said Dave Portnoy, who founded media company Barstool Sports. "That is consequences for your actions."Late-night Fox host Greg Gutfeld argued that Kimmel had "deliberately and misleadingly" blamed Kirk's "allies and friends" for his death.British presenter Piers Morgan said Kimmel had caused "understandable outrage all over America", adding: "Why is he being heralded as some kind of free speech martyr?"But one of Carr's FCC leadership colleagues, commissioner Anna Gomez, a Democrat, criticised the regulator's stance.She said that "an inexcusable act of political violence by one disturbed individual must never be exploited as justification for broader censorship or control".Listen to Americast on BBC Sounds: Is the Trump administration clamping down on America's first amendment protection of free speech?Charlie Kirk murder suspect appears in court, with prosecutors seeking death penaltyReport those who celebrate Charlie Kirk death to employers, Vance saysIs this the death of the late night US chat show?Who is Tyler Robinson, the suspect in custody for shooting Charlie Kirk?MediaDonald TrumpUnited StatesRelatedExpletive messages shown in S4C court case documentsJudge strikes down 'superfluous' Trump lawsuit against the New York TimesUS TV hosts back Kimmel as Trump threatens networksMore from the BBC29 mins agoUS prosecutor resigns after Trump says 'I want him out'Erik Siebert was investigating accusations of mortgage fraud against Trump adversary Letitia James.29 mins ago48 mins agoWhat does the FCC do - and can it revoke a TV network's licence?The suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's show has triggered concerns about the US communications regulator's power over TV networks. 48 mins ago1 hr agoSikh granny's arrest by US immigration sparks community angerHarjit Kaur, a 73-year-old who unsuccessfully applied for asylum, was arrested by immigration authorities last week.1 hr ago1 hr agoTrump says Xi approves of TikTok deal as leaders plan South Korea meetingThe president hailed "progress" during a phone call with Xi and said that he also would travel to China next year.1 hr ago1 hr agoSenator Ted Cruz says US broadcast regulator acted like 'mafioso' on Jimmy Kimmel The Texas senator affected a mobster accent to criticise how ABC was pressed to take action on the late-night host.1 hr agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
