The world's tram-driving pros were tested on their ability to operate the vehicles in eight challenges, which included braking and accelerating smoothly.One test saw a bowl of water strapped to the front of the tram, with the driver tasked with braking smoothly in an effort to not spill any liquid.Another challenge - tram curling - saw the drivers push a bicycle trolley so it halted at a specific spot. Tram bowling, in which a giant ball is used to knock down inflatable pins, was
another fan favourite. ReutersAmong the challenges was the unique idea of 'tram bowling'While Austria nabbed first place, second place was awarded to Poland, while Norway took third, and Croatia finished last. The Austrian entrant Florijan Isaku said he was "overwhelmed" and "speechless" to have won in his native country. "It's just great", he said, calling Vienna's public transport operator Wiener Linien "a family".But it was a disappointing day for Hungary, who learnt that speed isn't everything. "Curling was the most challenging task for me and I didn't really succeed as I would have liked", European champion Krisztina Schneider told AFP. "I thought my speed would be enough but in the end it wasn't."Next year's European championships are due to take place in Warsaw, Poland.EuropeViennaRelatedI took a job on a whim on New Year's Eve - and ended up stranded at sea for six monthsEstonia seeks Nato consultation after Russian jets violate airspaceNotre-Dame's iconic towers reopen six years after fireMore from the BBC26 Aug 2025Teen avoids jail over plot to attack Taylor Swift Vienna concertMohamed A will serve an 18-month suspended sentence after sending bomb-making instructions.26 Aug 202512 Aug 2025How a market town shaped Dame Stephanie ShirleyDame Stephanie Shirley is known for being a tech industry and women's rights pioneer.12 Aug 202527 Jun 2025Syrian charged over plot to attack Taylor Swift Vienna concert A young Syrian national is suspected of supporting a foreign terror group over a foiled plot in Vienna last August.27 Jun 20259 Mar 2025Russian spy ring's plans to kill journalist 'beyond imagination'Bulgarian journalist Christo Grozev told the BBC one method was to use a sledgehammer, and another involved using a "suicide bomber".9 Mar 202530 Dec 2024Vienna Airport apologises to 'abandoned' Scots A Scottish family were left "stranded" in Vienna without luggage and had to pay for a hotel and replacement flight.30 Dec 2024British Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
