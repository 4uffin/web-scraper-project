It also features a 12-megapixel camera.During his demonstrations to the audience, things didn't always go to plan.A call via WhatsApp - which is also owned by Meta - to the glasses did not go through despite repeated attempts."I don't know what to tell you guys," Mr Zuckerberg said to attendees. "I keep on messing this up." Despite the hiccup, Mr Zuckerberg hopes Meta's line of smart accessories will be a key platform for integrating its artificial intelligence tool, Meta AI, into people's lives.Analysts say smart glasses are likely to be more successful than the firm's multi-billion dollar Metaverse project - virtual worlds to connect users across digital environments."Unlike VR headsets, glasses are an everyday, non-cumbersome form factor," said Forrester VP, Research Director Mike Proulx.But, he added, "the onus is on Meta to convince the vast majority of people who don't own AI glasses that the benefits outweigh the cost."ReutersMark Zuckerberg also unveiled the Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glassesThe company said it does not discuss sales information but it is understood to have sold around two million pairs of smart glasses since it entered the market in 2023.The Display will be available this month and sell for $799 (£586), hundreds of dollars more than Meta's current smart glasses.Leo Gebbie of CCS Insight said he is sceptical that it will gain as much traction as Meta's other smart glass models."The Ray-Bans have done well because they're easy to use, inconspicuous and relatively affordable," Mr Gebbie said.Mr Zuckerberg also unveiled $499 Oakley Meta Vanguard glasses, which are aimed at sports enthusiasts, as well as the second generation of the Ray-Ban Meta glasses, priced at $379.Meta is currently in the middle of a massive spending spree as it bolsters its AI operations.Mr Zuckerberg said in July that the company would spend hundreds of billions of dollars on building sprawling AI data centres in the US.One of the sites is expected to cover an area that is nearly the size of Manhattan.That AI infrastructure investment is complemented by huge spending on hiring top talent away from rival companies.Meta has said it would develop what it called "superintelligence," AI technology that can out-think human beings.Parents protestEarlier on Wednesday, activists and family members of suicide victims protested at Meta's New York headquarters, demanding more safeguards for children on social media platforms, including those owned by the company.Last week, two former Meta safety researchers testified before the US Senate that Meta covered up potential harms to children stemming from its virtual reality products. Jason Sattizahn and Cayce Savage said the company told in-house researchers to avoid work that could produce evidence of harm to children from its VR products.Meta has denied the allegations and called the claims "nonsense."Meta to spend hundreds of billions to build AI data centresMeta covered up potential child harms, whistleblowers claim Meta to stop its AI chatbots from talking to teens about suicideSign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter to follow the world's top tech stories and trends.
