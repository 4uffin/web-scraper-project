Out of the 18 million young people of working age, only three million have jobs in the formal sector - meaning they get regular wages and pay taxes.In Angola's main cities, the many jobless young people, who are no longer in school, highlight the state's difficulty in meeting their aspirations."I only sell on the street when I can get enough money to buy the soft drinks," the street vendor said."There are months when I don't sell anything at all because business is so slow. Me and so many other young people live like this and nobody pays attention to us. That's why we can't stay silent."Angolan sociologist Gilson Lázaro was not surprised by what happened in July. He believes that those at the heart of the protests were the "dispossessed"."These are young people, the majority, who have nothing left but their lives. That is why they took to the streets without fear," he said.AFP via Getty ImagesThe family of Silvia Mubiala mourned her death - she was killed during July's protests, allegedly shot by policeThe protests emerged spontaneously in some of Luanda's more populous and poorer neighbourhoods, where some residents lack access to basic sanitation as well as other essential infrastructure.Gradually, demonstrators moved into the capital's main avenues, causing chaos and "lifting the veil on a social problem that has long existed but which the political elite has preferred to ignore", according to the sociologist."For some time now, Angola has been heading towards a deep social, economic and, above all, political legitimacy crisis. The root cause is the flawed way the country has been governed since the end of the civil war in 2002," Dr Lázaro added.The Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) has been in charge of the country for the five decades of independence.There had been some hope that João Lourenço, who in 2017 took over as president from José Eduardo dos Santos, 36 years in power, would change things.He is now serving a second consecutive term following the 2022 election.Lourenço promised to overhaul what he saw as the broken system inherited from his predecessor: tackling corruption, diversifying the economy and creating jobs.Eight years on, critics argue he has failed to do so and is struggling to manage the cost-of-living crisis - and though falling slightly, the annual inflation rate remains high at around 18%. According to a 2024 Afrobarometer survey, 63% of Angolans say the country's economic situation has worsened when compared to the previous year.Young people have borne the brunt of the problems and have been at the forefront of most anti-government protests in recent years, on issues ranging from corruption and police brutality to demands for local elections, and against hunger and poverty.Yet nothing matched the scale of July's unrest.Lea Komba, a 20-year-old political science student, says the fuel protests were "terrifying but somewhat expected" given the country's current reality."We live in a country where young people are ignored by those in power. Protests are the only way to show dissatisfaction with the precarious conditions we face," she said.AFP via Getty ImagesIn Luanda, shops were looted during the protestsThe Angolan government has taken a different view.A government official did not respond to a BBC request to comment on the demonstrations and their aftermath, but in a national address on 1 August, President Lourenço made his feelings clear.He condemned the protests as "acts committed by irresponsible citizens, manipulated by anti-patriotic national and foreign organisations through social media, bringing mourning, destruction of public and private property, reduced access to essential goods and services, and job losses for Angolans".Despite repeated promises to diversify its economy, Angola remains dependent on oil and gas, which are by far the country's main exports as well as the key source of government revenue."Natural resources are good, but the problem lies in how revenues are used," Angolan economist Francisco Paulo said."If Angola followed models like Norway or Saudi Arabia, using oil wealth to strengthen non-oil sectors and develop its workforce, it would be a blessing. Unfortunately, revenues here are wasted on superficial expenses with no added value."Following Dos Santos's departure, Angola endured five years consecutive years when the economy shrunk between 2017 and 2021.AFP via Getty ImagesWhen João Lourenço came to power after the 2017 election there were hopes that things would change in the countryGrowth only returned in 2022, largely driven by non-oil sectors. But recent growth has had little impact on most Angolans' lives.In a report this year, the World Bank estimated that more than a third of the population live on less than $2.15 per day.It said that while the economy was expanding it was not keeping up with population growth, meaning that, on average, people were getting poorer.As independence celebrations approach, plans including music festivals, presidential medal ceremonies and a football match to include Argentinian Lionel Messi are in full swing.But student Ms Komba questions the old socialist slogan "one people, one nation", coined during the one-party Marxist-Leninist regime of the late 1970s."It's simply not true that we all share the same reality. There is huge inequality. Young people in marginalised areas are almost condemned to extreme poverty, without quality education or decent jobs, even if they study hard and earn a degree," she said."These young people think with their stomachs, because hunger leaves them with nothing to lose. They are the ones who filled the streets."Ms Komba added that "the authorities must look at root causes, not just consequences"."The looting was simply the way young people found to draw attention from those in power."She thinks that there could be more unrest."From now until the 2027 elections we will likely see more protests. Whether we like it or not, political awareness is growing in Angola, and elections are seen as a crucial moment for real change."More BBC stories about Angola:Angola's João Lourenço - the man taking on Isabel dos SantosLargest pink diamond in 300 years found in AngolaRediscovering the African roots of Brazil's martial art capoeiraEx-Trafigura boss convicted of bribery in landmark caseIsabel dos Santos hits out over UK's 'dirty money' sanctionsGetty Images/BBCGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.Follow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafricaBBC Africa podcastsFocus on AfricaThis Is AfricaAngolaAfricaRelatedAngola's petrol protest death toll rises as medics overwhelmedMore than 1,000 people arrested over deadly Angola fuel protestsGabon's ousted president and family freed after two years and fly to AngolaMore from the BBC17 hrs agoMurdered Kenyan's friends want UK soldier to face justiceFriends of the stabbed 21-year-old Kenyan woman recount to the BBC events on the night she went missing.17 hrs ago1 day agoMalawi police arrest eight for alleged election fraudOfficials are on high alert after the 2019 presidential election result was annulled due to vote tampering.1 day ago1 day agoSouth Africa police uncover $20m crystal meth labFive North Americans were arrested after the raid on a farm in the east of the country, officers say.1 day ago2 days ago'I'm Kenyan, don't shoot' - the athlete who says he was duped into the Russian armyEvans Kibet, now being held in Ukraine after surrendering, says he did not know he was signing up.2 days ago2 days agoDrone strike on Sudan mosque kills 78, medic tells BBCLocal activists and residents describe the early morning attack on worshippers.2 days agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
