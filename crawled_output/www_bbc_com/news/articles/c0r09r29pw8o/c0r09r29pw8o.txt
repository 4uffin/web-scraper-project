Not only did they send a 70 year-old man to five years in jail, it was a shocking 20 years after the offence.They also stipulated that the sentence was not "suspensive" – in other words they said he would go to jail even if he lodged an appeal, even though in French law pending an appeal he is in theory still innocent.Just when you thought the old passions for and against the man were beginning to fade, suddenly they are back with a vengeance.Many will feel some sympathy with Sarkozy – not necessarily that he is entirely guiltless in this matter of seeking Libyan campaign money.AFP via Getty ImageBut they will see some truth in his claims of victimisation: that there are indeed some in the Paris "politico-mediatic-judicial" establishment who loathe the former president and rejoice in bringing him down.Look through another lens, though, and Sarkozy is not some hard-done-by ex-head of state, but an egotistical and highly influential political operator who has consistently pushed the law to its limits in order to get his way.Why else would there be such a litany of lawsuits against him? Why else would Sarkozy already have been convicted on two other charges of corruption – once for trying to suborn a judge, and another time for illegal campaign funding?And if the court has now decided to throw the book at him in the Libya affair,
maybe it is because the charge of trying to elicit election funds from a foreign dictator is actually a rather serious one.It is all relevant today because even though Sarkozy is no longer the influential figure that some make him out to be, the arguments about this case echo through the hall of ruins that are French politics.The right and far-right take up his cause, crying foul about left-wing judicial over-reach. Marine Le Pen – herself banned from running for the presidency because of a "no-suspension" clause in her own conviction early this year – was first to denounce the "injustice".And the left sees it all as more evidence of rich men's privilege – the powerful getting more powerful by blithely ignoring the law.Nicolas Sarkozy has long since left office, and there is no prospect of his returning.
He is a figure of the past.
But his case lays bare the divisions in a very divided country.France's Nicolas Sarkozy: 'Bling' and legal woesFranceCorruptionRelatedFormer French president Sarkozy given five-year sentence after Libya caseFrench navy seizes nearly 10 tonnes of cocaine off West African coastBuoy recovered after drifting away from FranceMore from the BBC11 Sep 2025Ex-senator's wife sentenced to more than four years in bribery schemeNadine Menendez, whose husband is already in prison, was convicted for her role in a bribery scheme involving gold bars, cash and a Mercedes-Benz 11 Sep 20254 Sep 2025PC posed as paedophile hunter to blackmail suspectThe PC anonymously demanded £3,500 from a man arrested on suspicion of possessing indecent images of children.4 Sep 202530 Jun 2025Key witness in ex-Peru mayor's corruption case found deadJosé Miguel Castro was collaborating with prosecutors in the corruption case against Susana Villarán.30 Jun 202521 May 2025Former DR Congo PM sentenced to hard labour on corruption chargeAugustin Ponyo Matata is found guilty of his part in embezzling about $245m.21 May 20253 May 2025Brazil social security minister latest to quit in major pension fraud scandalThe scheme allegedly saw pensioners defrauded of payments, with the diverted money shared among corrupt officials.3 May 2025British Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseSubscription TermsAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
