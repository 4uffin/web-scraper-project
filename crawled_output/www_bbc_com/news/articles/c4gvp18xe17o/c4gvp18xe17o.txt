'I can love her, I can know she loved me'Watson has now done an interview with podcaster Jay Shetty, who asked her about critical comments Rowling has appeared to make in recent years about the actress and her co-stars in light of the rift.Watson said her previous relationship with Rowling means she is still able to "treasure Jo".She added: "I think the thing I'm most upset about is that a conversation was never made possible."The actress, now 35, praised Rowling for the "kindness and words of encouragement" she gave when she was growing up, and for the opportunity to play a character that "to be honest barely exists in the history of English literature"."There's just no world in which I could ever cancel her out, or cancel that out, for anything," Watson said. "It has to remain true. It is true."I just don't know what else to do other than hold these two seemingly incompatible things together at the same time and just hope maybe they will one day resolve or co-join themselves, and maybe accept that they never will, but that they can both still be true."And I can love her, I can know she loved me, I can be grateful to her, I can know the things that she said [about me] are true, and there can be this whole other thing."And my job feels like to just hold all of it. But the bigger thing is just, what she's done will never be taken away from me."Watson played Hermione Granger in the eight films based on Rowling's books between 2001 and 2011.Open letterFollowing the actress's interview, Rowling posted on X on Thursday: "A little reminder for anyone who may be regretting their very public sprint to the front of the mob and is now trying to discreetly shove their pitchfork out of sight."She didn't specifically mention Watson or anyone else by name. The author linked to a post she wrote in May, which began: "In light of recent open letters from academia and the arts criticising the UK's Supreme Court ruling on sex-based rights, it's possibly worth remembering that nobody sane believes, or has ever believed, that humans can change sex, or that binary sex isn't a material fact."Watson was among 1,600 film and TV figures who signed an open letter saying they "stand in solidarity with the trans, non-binary, and intersex communities" who were affected by the Supreme Court ruling, which said a woman is defined by biological sex under equalities law.The other signatories included Eddie Redmayne, who starred in Rowling's Fantastic Beasts films; Paapa Essiedu, who is playing Severus Snape in the forthcoming Potter TV series; and Katie Leung, who played Cho Chang in the Potter movies.JK Rowling reignites row with Harry Potter starsJK Rowling dismisses backlash over trans commentsJK Rowling responds to trans tweets criticismEmma WatsonJK RowlingHarry PotterFilmTransgender peopleRelatedEmma Watson banned from driving for speedingJK Rowling reignites row with Harry Potter starsShould adult Harry Potter fans 'grow up and get over it'?More from the BBC12 hrs agoAustralian film altered in China to make gay couple straightA scene featuring a same-sex couple was digitally altered to depict a heterosexual couple.12 hrs ago14 hrs agoFailed sale of famous studios cost taxpayers £430kThe failed sale of the famous Bottle Yard studios in south Bristol cost £430k to Bristol taxpayers.14 hrs ago15 hrs agoFilming for Harry Potter TV series spotted in townFans of the young wizard capture a scene for the upcoming HBO series being shot in Hertfordshire.15 hrs ago20 hrs agoMovie festival gives platform to new filmmakersWorcester Film Festival showcases emerging filmmakers as part of its programme of 120 screenings.20 hrs ago1 day agoMatthew McConaughey on starring with his family in film about California's deadliest wildfireThe actor plays a school bus driver trapped in US wildfires, appearing with his real mother and son.1 day agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseSubscription TermsAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
