Kennedy had dismissed the committee's full membership in June, and has appointed all of its new membersThe second, Dr Monarez said, was "to dismiss career officials responsible for vaccine policy, without cause."When she refused to resign, Kennedy said he had already spoken to the White House about having her removed, she said, adding he informed her he was in frequent communication with President Donald Trump about changes to US vaccine policy.Kennedy, a notable vaccine sceptic, has previously denied that she was told to sign off on vaccine recommendations that did not have a scientific basis.Dr Monarez also testified that Kennedy called CDC staff "horrible people" and the health agency "corrupt".Her dismissal came shortly after after a man allegedly shot 180 rounds at the CDC headquarters, killing the responding police officer, in protest of Covid vaccines. It made headlines around the world.Dr Monarez then published an opinion article in the Wall Street Journal that "the Senate confirmed me to ensure that unbiased evidence serves our nation's health, and for doing that, I lost my job", while Kennedy told a different congressional hearing that he let her go because she was not trustworthy.Soon after she was fired, other leaders at the CDC resigned, including then-Chief Medical Officer Debra Houry, who also testified on Wednesday.Why the world is watching RFK's fight with US health agencyRFK Jr 'endangering' Americans, say former CDC bossesGetty ImagesIn his own testimony earlier this month, RFK Jr said Monarez told him she is not a "trustworthy person."The two former officials portrayed Kennedy as someone who put politics ahead of science, was uninterested in data and science, and rarely communicated with the agency's experts and leaders.Dr
Houry said she quit "because CDC leaders were reduced to rubber stamps". When the US experienced a deadly measles outbreak this year, Dr Houry was not asked to brief Kennedy on the response."Usually you would be briefing leadership," she said. "He also said things like vaccines had fetal parts, and I had to send a note to our leadership team to correct that misinformation."Since Kennedy was confirmed, he has been criticised by health groups and scientists, as well as former health secretaries from both parties, for his major staff reductions, changes to the immunisation panel, push on vaccines and leadership. He, in turn, has accused federal health agencies and public health groups of being beholden to corporate interests, such as drug makers, and ignoring possible chronic health threats, such as food additives.Meanwhile, the country's fight over vaccines has intensified. A group of US states has banded together to follow their own standards on childhood immunisations instead of federal ones, while Florida is working to eliminate all of its vaccine mandates. ACIP is expected to meet later this week, and there are reports it could change the schedule for vaccinating children against Hepatitis B.In testimony on Dr Monarez's firing at a hearing this month, Kennedy said she was let go because she answered "no" when he asked her if she was a "trustworthy person."Dr Monarez told the committee that Kennedy had told her he did not think he could not trust her. She responded that then he should fire her.Republicans, who lead the committee and control the Senate, largely said they agreed with Kennedy's decision to fire her, with many accusing both Drs Monarez and Houry of not being open to making changes at the CDC and for not looking into all data on vaccines. Some also accused Dr Monarez of working to block the Trump administration's agenda while at the CDC.The two denied those allegations.US politicsUnited StatesRobert F Kennedy JrRelatedJimmy Kimmel show to return after suspension over Charlie Kirk commentsKirk memorial's religious and political mix hints at future of Maga movementHeightened security as Americans gather for Kirk memorial More from the BBC2 hrs agoUS Supreme Court to revisit laws curtailing Trump's power to fire top officialsThe ruling allows the president to remove the sole Democratic official on the Federal Trade Commission, an independent body set up by Congress.2 hrs ago3 hrs agoTrump urges pregnant women to avoid Tylenol over unproven autism linkSome studies have suggested an association between the two, but experts say there is no causal relationship. 3 hrs ago6 hrs agoWhite House denies border tsar Tom Homan accepted $50,000 bribeThe White House says FBI agents under the last administration had tried to "entrap" Homan.6 hrs ago6 hrs agoTop stars call Jimmy Kimmel suspension 'dark moment' for free speechJennifer Aniston, Meryl Streep and Robert DeNiro are among more than 400 celebrities who signed a letter defending the comedian.6 hrs ago14 hrs agoTrump hails Charlie Kirk as martyr to thousands at memorial serviceThe US president broke with the forgiveness message of Kirk's widow, Erika, to say he hated his opponents.14 hrs agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
