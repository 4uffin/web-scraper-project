"incredibly difficult time" after the recent death of Caerphilly Senedd member Hefin David. On Wednesday a spokesperson said there was a "private engagement tonight between the first minister and MSs" after Mr David's death. Conservative Senedd leader Darren Millar said it would be seen as a "snub" by the United States and was "deeply regrettable".Millar told The Phone In on BBC Radio Wales "all of us have been affected by the terrible tragic death of our dear colleague Hefin David and, of course, my heart goes out with great sympathy
to everybody in the Labour Party, including Labour MSs". "But the first minister has a deputy first minister, she also has other government ministers and Wales should be represented," he said. "It will be deemed to be a snub by the United States that's there's no Welsh government representative at this very important event."That, I think, is deeply, deeply regrettable."Welsh government analysis suggests the US is Wales' second most valuable trading partner by country, though the EU is bigger overall.In May, Morgan warned Wales could be hit harder than England by US tariffs, given its heavier reliance on goods exports.ReutersTrump and Melania landed at London Stansted Airport on Tuesday night for the President's second state visit to the UKTalks on scrapping tariffs on UK steel are on hold, with US officials raising concerns over Tata's shift from blast furnaces to new electric arc furnaces, due in 2027.Morgan congratulated Trump on his re-election last year, calling the US–Wales relationship "highly valued", though in 2017 she had described him as "off-the-scale crazy" in a BBC Wales interview.On Tuesday night the Welsh government said Morgan wrote to the King to "thank him for his gracious invite" but feels "her place is here with colleagues as she continues to support them during this incredibly difficult time".At Wednesday lunchtime a new statement from a Welsh government spokesperson said: "There is a private engagement tonight between the first minister and MSs following the death of Hefin David."It is still unclear when the invitation to the banquet was received or when Wednesday night's engagement with Senedd members was arranged.Morgan is not the only high profile party leader to turn down an invite to the banquet.In August, the Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey said he was boycotting the event to send President Trump a message over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.But Scottish First Minister John Swinney said he would attend the Windsor event.Plaid Cymru leaders Rhun ap Iorwerth and Liz Saville Roberts have criticised Starmer's decision to welcome Trump with full state honours, warning that "his presence risks emboldening extremism at home and abroad".Is Welsh Labour turning away from Keir Starmer?Trump hails 'very good' relationship as he arrives in UK for state visitWelsh Labour set apart from UK party, says MorganWalesWelsh governmentDonald TrumpWelsh LabourEluned MorganRelatedWelsh Labour accused of manipulating NHS waiting figuresRise in asylum hotel misinformation, council body saysVice chancellor vote of no confidence over job cutsMore from the BBC31 mins agoWhy America is at a dangerous crossroads following the Charlie Kirk shooting This moment has parallels with other periods of discord in US history, but it is more complicated than simply repeating them.31 mins ago2 hrs agoJimmy Kimmel taken off air over Charlie Kirk commentsThe late-night host said on Monday that Trump's allies were "doing everything they can to score political points from" Kirk's death.2 hrs ago3 hrs agoWhat was on the menu and who was on guest list at state banquet?Chicken and a special cocktail are being served, while Rupert Murdoch and Tim Cook are among the guests.3 hrs ago6 hrs ago'Pay attention' - Spirit aircraft warned as it gets too close to Air Force OneAir traffic controllers warn Spirit flight after it came too close to President Donald Trump's aircraft as he flew to the United Kingdom for his state visit. 6 hrs ago6 hrs agoWatch: Mexico and Canada are meeting without Trump - here's whyPresident Claudia Sheinbaum and Prime Minister Mark Carney's meeting is meant to kickstart a new economic bilateral relationship.6 hrs agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
