The team of retired judges was set up last month to look into allegations that animals at Vantara were acquired unlawfully and mistreated. On Monday, it said it had found "no foul play" in the zoo's management. The Supreme Court had previously also said the allegations appeared unsupported, but ordered an inquiry after allegations the authorities failed to investigate the zoo properly. Vantara said the investigation had made clear "the doubts and allegations... were without any basis". Vantara is home to 2,000 species, including elephants, tigers and other animals. Spread over 3,500 acres, it is located in Jamnagar in the western state of Gujarat, not far from Mukesh Ambani's oil refinery - which is the largest in the world.It was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in March this year and was one of the venues for its owner Anant Ambani's lavish pre-wedding events that made global headlines last year. Closed to the public, Vantara has drawn criticism from wildlife activists and conservationists for numerous reasons including the unsuitability of the region's hot and dry climate for some of the animals.The shelter was also at the centre of angry protests in the state of Maharashtra recently, after an ailing elephant from a temple in Kolhapur town was relocated to Vantara in July, after a high court order.On Tuesday, the court rejected the application against the transfer of the ailing elephant, saying an independent inquiry had already cleared authorities of the charges.
