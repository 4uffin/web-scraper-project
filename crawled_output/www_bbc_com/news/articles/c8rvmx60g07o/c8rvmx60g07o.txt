It posted photographs showing several destroyed and damaged buildings.Health ministry spokesman Dr Anees al-Asbahi accused the IDF of the "deliberate and systematic targeting of civilian, service, and residential facilities", which he said was "a war crime in every sense of the word.He reported that eight people were killed and 142 injured, and that civilians were among them. He added that first responders were still searching under rubble for casualties.ReutersThe Israeli strikes happened moments before a speech by Houthi leader Abdul Malik al-HouthiIsraeli Defence Minister Israel Katz wrote on X that his country had "delivered a powerful strike on numerous terror targets of the Houthi terror organisation in Sanaa".The IDF said in a statement that the targets included the Houthi military's General Staff Command Headquarters, security and intelligence compounds, the Houthis' "military public relations headquarters", and military camps used to store weapons."The IDF will operate against the ongoing and repeated attacks of the Houthi terrorist regime against the State of Israel, will conduct additional offensive operations against the Houthi regime in the near future," it added.A separate statement from the Israeli military said an inquiry into Wednesday's Houthi attack on Eilat had suggested that the drone launched from Yemen was "detected relatively late, and that warning sirens were activated in accordance with protocol."Interception attempts were made using the Iron Dome [air defence system], but were unsuccessful. The cause for that has been identified, and corrective measures were implemented."Since the beginning of the war in Gaza, Israeli forces have intercepted more than 98% of the drones launched towards Israel by the Houthis, according to the IDF.The Houthis' military spokesman said the attack was a "response to the crimes of genocide and the dangerous escalation carried out by the Israeli enemy against our people in the Gaza Strip".On 10 September, four days after a Houthi drone attack on Eilat's Ramon airport wounded one person, the Israeli military carried out a series of strikes in Sanaa and al-Jawf province that killed 35 people, according to the Houthi-run health ministry.The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) said last week that 31 journalists and media support workers were among those killed in Sanaa and that the incident constituted the deadliest single attack on the press worldwide in 16 years.Yemen's September 26 newspaper said all but one of them had worked in its office or the headquarters of the government's Moral Guidance Directorate, which were both bombed.The IDF said at the time that it had targeted the "Houthi Public Relations Department".IsraelYemenHouthis RelatedTrump says he 'will not allow' Netanyahu to annex West BankPalestinians in West Bank stranded as Israel shuts only international crossingBBC and news agencies launch film calling on Israel to allow foreign journalists into GazaMore from the BBC1 day agoTwenty injured in Yemen drone attack on Israel, rescuers and military sayTwo have been taken to hospital with serious shrapnel injuries, the Magen David Adom ambulance service says.1 day ago11 Sep 2025Israeli strikes in Yemen kill 35 people, Houthis sayThe Israeli military says it hit military targets, but the Houthis say only civilian sites were targeted.11 Sep 20251 Sep 2025UN chief demands release of 11 staff arrested in YemenThe food and children's agency workers are the latest UN staff detained by Houthi authorities.1 Sep 202530 Aug 2025Houthis confirm their prime minister killed in Israeli strikeAhmed Ghaleb Nasser al-Rahawi and several other Houthi officials were killed in the attack, the Iran-backed movement says.30 Aug 202524 Aug 2025Israel hits Yemen's Houthis after reports group used cluster bombThe strikes come after Israel said the Houthis used cluster munitions in a missile fired at Israel.24 Aug 2025British Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseSubscription TermsAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
