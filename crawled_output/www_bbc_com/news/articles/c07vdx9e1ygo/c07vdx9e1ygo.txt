Instead it pointed to India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau's (AAIB) preliminary investigation report into the crash.The lawsuit alleges that both firms knew about the risk of a crash since they developed and marketed the 787 Dreamliner and its components.It cited a 2018 FAA advisory that urged -
but did not mandate - operators to inspect the fuel switches' locking mechanism to ensure that it could not be accidentally moved, thereby cutting off fuel supply.In the case of Air India Flight 171, the switch was moved from "run" to the "cut-off" position, hampering the thrust of the plane, according to the AAIB's preliminary investigation report.The families said this amounted to a design "defect" that "allowed for inadvertent cutoff of fuel supply and total loss of thrust necessary to propel" the plane.They said: "And what did Honeywell and Boeing do to prevent the inevitable catastrophe? Nothing."The companies also failed to warn airlines that the switches required inspection and repair, and did not supply replacement parts to enable its customers to install them, according to the lawsuit.Boeing and Honeywell "sat idly" behind a gentle advisory that merely recommended inspecting the switches, said the families, who are represented by Texas-based Lanier Law Firm.A more detailed report of the crash is expected sometime in 2026.A total of 229 passengers, 12 cabin crew and 19 people on the ground perished when the plane crashed.Air India crash victim's son says he received 'other' remainsAir India watchdog audit reveals 51 safety violationsThe voices in the cockpit fuelling controversy over Air India crashAviation accidents and incidentsInternational BusinessAir India flight AI171 plane crashRelatedPlane that crashed lost power after take offAir crash families seek answers on remains errorInquest opens into fatal helicopter crashMore from the BBC1 hr agoGlobal conflicts drive demand for war risk insuranceWars in Ukraine and the Middle East are fuelling take-up of cover against impact and damage.1 hr ago3 days agoElectric aviation awaits a battery breakthroughWith batteries still too heavy, start-up plane makers are exploring hybrid options for new aircraft.3 days ago3 days agoChina is calling a TikTok deal a win.
