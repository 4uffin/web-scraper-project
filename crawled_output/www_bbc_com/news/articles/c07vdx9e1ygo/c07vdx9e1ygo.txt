Instead it pointed to India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau's (AAIB) preliminary investigation report into the crash.The lawsuit alleges that both firms knew about the risk of a crash since they developed and marketed the 787 Dreamliner and its components.It cited a 2018 FAA advisory that urged -
but did not mandate - operators to inspect the fuel switches' locking mechanism to ensure that it could not be accidentally moved, thereby cutting off fuel supply.In the case of Air India Flight 171, the switch was moved from "run" to the "cut-off" position, hampering the thrust of the plane, according to the AAIB's preliminary investigation report.The families said this amounted to a design "defect" that "allowed for inadvertent cutoff of fuel supply and total loss of thrust necessary to propel" the plane.They said: "And what did Honeywell and Boeing do to prevent the inevitable catastrophe? Nothing."The companies also failed to warn airlines that the switches required inspection and repair, and did not supply replacement parts to enable its customers to install them, according to the lawsuit.Boeing and Honeywell "sat idly" behind a gentle advisory that merely recommended inspecting the switches, said the families, who are represented by Texas-based Lanier Law Firm.A more detailed report of the crash is expected sometime in 2026.A total of 229 passengers, 12 cabin crew and 19 people on the ground perished when the plane crashed.Air India crash victim's son says he received 'other' remainsAir India watchdog audit reveals 51 safety violationsThe voices in the cockpit fuelling controversy over Air India crashAviation accidents and incidentsInternational BusinessAir India flight AI171 plane crashRelatedFlight attendant hurt in plane steps fall - reportThe sun sets on India's iconic and controversial Soviet fighter jetAir India crash aftermath handled 'irresponsibly', says courtMore from the BBC10 mins agoTrump announces new tariffs on drugs, trucks and kitchen cabinetsThe US president said the move aims to help protect American manufacturers from foreign imports.10 mins ago2 hrs agoThe bacteria turning waste plastic into painkillersHow did E. coli become such an essential tool for scientists and will anything replace it?2 hrs ago3 hrs agoChina launches campaign to keep killjoys off the internetPessimistic social media posts may now be targets of a fresh crackdown by the Chinese government.3 hrs ago2 days agoBoss jailed for 15 years over deadly fire at S Korea battery plantA blaze last year killed 23 people at an Aricell factory in Hwaseong city, about 45km south of Seoul.2 days ago2 days agoTikTok child data protection inadequate, Canadian privacy officials sayTikTok says it will introduce measures to "strengthen our platform" although it disputes some of the findings.2 days agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseSubscription TermsAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
