Instead it pointed to India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau's (AAIB) preliminary investigation report into the crash.The lawsuit alleges that both firms knew about the risk of a crash since they developed and marketed the 787 Dreamliner and its components.It cited a 2018 FAA advisory that urged -
but did not mandate - operators to inspect the fuel switches' locking mechanism to ensure that it could not be accidentally moved, thereby cutting off fuel supply.In the case of Air India Flight 171, the switch was moved from "run" to the "cut-off" position, hampering the thrust of the plane, according to the AAIB's preliminary investigation report.The families said this amounted to a design "defect" that "allowed for inadvertent cutoff of fuel supply and total loss of thrust necessary to propel" the plane.They said: "And what did Honeywell and Boeing do to prevent the inevitable catastrophe? Nothing."The companies also failed to warn airlines that the switches required inspection and repair, and did not supply replacement parts to enable its customers to install them, according to the lawsuit.Boeing and Honeywell "sat idly" behind a gentle advisory that merely recommended inspecting the switches, said the families, who are represented by Texas-based Lanier Law Firm.A more detailed report of the crash is expected sometime in 2026.A total of 229 passengers, 12 cabin crew and 19 people on the ground perished when the plane crashed.Air India crash victim's son says he received 'other' remainsAir India watchdog audit reveals 51 safety violationsThe voices in the cockpit fuelling controversy over Air India crashAviation accidents and incidentsInternational BusinessAir India flight AI171 plane crashRelatedAir India crash aftermath handled 'irresponsibly', says courtPlane that crashed lost power after take offAir crash families seek answers on remains errorMore from the BBC8 hrs agoPorsche shares plunge after announcing EV rollout delayEuropean carmakers face intense competition from Chinese rivals and weak demand for luxury cars.8 hrs ago16 hrs agoWhat's the big deal about AI data centres?Huge investment is going into data centres for AI, but why are they so expensive?16 hrs ago1 day agoOutdoor brand Arc'teryx apologises for 'dragon' fireworks in HimalayasOfficials are investigating the firm after the display drew backlash for its potential environmental impact.1 day ago2 days agoGlobal conflicts drive demand for war risk insuranceWars in Ukraine and the Middle East are fuelling take-up of cover against impact and damage.2 days ago5 days agoWe have hybrid cars, now hybrid planes are comingWith batteries still too heavy, start-up plane makers are exploring hybrid options for new aircraft.5 days agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
