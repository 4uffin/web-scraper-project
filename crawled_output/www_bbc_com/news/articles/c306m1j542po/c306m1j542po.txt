Her recipe for jollof, a popular West African dish, included 4,000kg (8,800lb) of rice, 500 cartons of tomato paste and 600kg of onions - all poured into a custom-made pot that can hold 23,000 litres.The dish took nine hours to cook but despite two attempts, it was not possible to weigh the enormous pot of food. However, a member of Baci's team told the BBC they were collating evidence from different cameras to send to Guinness World Records (GWR) so it could be officially recognised. The organisation had tweeted a message of good luck to Baci, 28, in advance of her attempt.The event was trending on social media and videos show that as the huge red pan was being lifted, one side buckled and the supporting legs gave way, however the food did not spill.Afterwards the giant dish of jollof rice, which also included 168kg of goat meat, was divided into individual portions and distributed to the huge crowds.The chef told BBC Pidgin that it took her a year to plan how she would tackle the mammoth challenge."We [Nigerians] are the giant of Africa, and jollof is a food that everybody knows Africans for," she said."It would make sense if we had the biggest pot of jollof rice, it would be nice for the country."She was assisted by 10 other chefs in red uniforms wielding long wooden spoons to stir the food.Manufacturing the giant steel vessel to hold her dish took a team of 300 people two months to make but one of its legs gave way at the crucial time.Jollof rice is a staple in several West African countries, featuring rice simmered in a tomato sauce, often paired with meat or seafood. Baci won a competition for her version of jollof rice in 2021, and then became a national sensation in 2023 when she claimed the world cooking marathon record - an exhausting 93 hours and 11 minutes, or nearly four days.However, she was later surpassed by Irish chef Alan Fisher. The current record-holder is Evette Quoibia from Australia, with 140 hours and 11 minutes, according to GWR.How world-record mania has gripped NigeriaWATCH: I cooked for 100 hours to put Nigeria on the mapVivid colours and bold flavours: The Nigerian food boomGetty Images/BBCGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.Follow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafricaBBC Africa podcastsFocus on AfricaThis Is AfricaNigeriaWorld recordsFoodAfricaRelatedAt least 10 dead in Lagos high-rise office building fireNigerian chef breaks world record for largest jollof rice dishNigerian pilot tests positive for alcohol after plane veered off runwayMore from the BBC1 hr agoEswatini says it has repatriated US deportee to JamaicaOrville Isaac Etoria had been held in prison in the southern African state after Trump's government expelled him.1 hr ago4 hrs agoMalawi ex-president takes clear lead in vote-count, results showPeter Mutharika has got about 66% of the votes counted so far, putting him ahead of President Lazarus Chakwera.4 hrs ago6 hrs agoThree West African countries to quit International Criminal CourtThe three military juntas, who came to power through coups, say the judicial body is 'incapable' of handling 'proven war crimes'.6 hrs ago1 day agoHow to eat less plasticMicroplastics gush out of our taps and flake off cookware.
