Canada has banned Irish language band Kneecap from entering the country, saying the group has "made statements that are contrary to Canadian values" that "have caused deep alarm".The hip-hop trio was due to perform in Toronto at two shows in October, and at two others in Vancouver.Canadian officials cited terror offence charges brought against one member of the group, Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh, in the UK in May, after he allegedly displayed a flag in support of the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah - which the UK considers a terrorist organisation - at a London gig last year.The 27-year-old denies the charges, with Kneecap calling the Canadian ban "deeply malicious" and threatening legal action.Announcing the ban on Monday, Canadian Liberal MP and Parliamentary Secretary for Combating Crime Vince Gasparro said in a video on X the group has "amplified political violence and publicly displayed support for terrorist organisations such as Hezbollah and Hamas.""These are not expressions of art or legitimate political critique," Gasparro said. "They are dangerous endorsements of violence and hate."Kneecap are no strangers to controversy, but is this time different?Thousands attend Kneecap home gig after year of controversyThe group responded to Gasparro in a post on X, writing that his statements are "wholly untrue and deeply malicious"."We have today instructed our lawyers to initiate legal action against you," the group said.The ban was welcomed by the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs in Canada. "The federal government made the right decision," said CEO Noah Shack, adding that "incitement, hate and radicalisation have no place in this country".Mr Ó hAnnaidh had previously dismissed the UK charges against him as a "political" case intended to silence Kneecap over its pro-Palestinian advocacy."We know this story is more than just about me and more than Kneecap – this is a story about Palestine and us as a distraction from the real story," he told a gathered crowd in London in August following his first court appearance.A decision over whether he would stand trial for the UK charges has been delayed, with the chief magistrate saying he would make a decision on 26 September.In August, Kneecap announced it was cancelling its US tour, citing Mr Ó hAnnaidh's legal battle. The group was due to perform 15 shows in major American cities in October. At the time, the band said its four Canadian shows in Vancouver and Toronto - to be played in front of up to approximately 7,500 fans - would still go ahead.The group, originally from Belfast, was dropped by its US booking agent in April after a show at Coachella where they displayed messages that read "Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinian people" and "F**k Israel, Free Palestine."Its members have also come under fire for their performance in Glastonbury in June, with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer saying he did not think the appearance would be "appropriate".The group was formed in 2017 by three musicians who go by the stage names of Mo Chara (the alias used by Mr Ó hAnnaidh), Móglaí Bap and DJ Próvaí.Their rise to fame inspired a semi-fictionalised film starring Oscar-nominated actor Michael Fassbender, which won a British Academy of Film Award (Bafta) in February.CanadaMusicRelatedAmerica's blame game over Canada's wildfire smoke misses the point, experts sayCanada bank employee charged with accessing PM Mark Carney's accountCanada top court pauses ostrich cull on farm at centre of avian flu battleMore from the BBC17 hrs agoDua Lipa denies firing agent over pro-Israel viewsReports claimed the singer dropped her agent after he urged Glastonbury to ban Irish band Kneecap.17 hrs ago1 day agoLulu: Telling the world I'm an alcoholic was liberatingThe Shout singer discloses her alcohol problem - and the family history that contributed to it.1 day ago1 day agoWoman jailed over scheme to steal Graceland from Elvis Presley familyJudge calls the brazen scheme to conduct a fraudulent sale of Graceland, the famed estate of Elvis Presley, "highly sophisticated".1 day ago1 day agoUB40 featuring Ali Campbell announce forest gigsUB40 featuring Ali Campbell will be performing at four forest gigs in June next year.1 day ago1 day agoNew ticket levy could help save city's music sceneA 1% levy could be applied to gig tickets in Bristol generating an estimated £400,000 to £1m every year.1 day agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
