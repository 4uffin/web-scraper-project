The attacks came after evacuation warnings were issued for several locations. There has been no immediate report of casualties.Israel has carried out air strikes on people and places it says are linked to Hezbollah almost every day despite a deal that ended the war with the group in November.The Lebanese prime minister called on the international community to urge Israel to stop what he described as intimidation and attacks, and to fulfil its ceasefire obligations.Footage posted online showed huge plumes of smoke in Mais al-Jabal, one of the locations hit. An Israeli military spokesman said the targets were infrastructure belonging to Hezbollah and in response to the group's attempts to re-establish activities in the area. He provided no evidence.Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Arabic spokesman Avichay Adraee said its forces had attacked and raided Hezbollah weapons warehouses, and their presence "constituted a violation of the understandings between Israel and Lebanon".He earlier had warned residents to evacuate buildings in the villages of Mais al-Jabal, Kfar Tibnit and Debbin, and later in two more villages.Lebanon's prime minister Nawaf Salam said on X his country was committed to ceasing hostile actions, but asked: "Where is Israel's commitment to these mechanisms?"He called on the international community, especially the countries sponsoring the ceasefire, "to exert maximum pressure on Israel to immediately stop its aggressions", to immediately withdraw from Lebanese territory and release prisoners.The US and France-brokered ceasefire was agreed between the governments of Israel and Lebanon, not Hezbollah. It states that Lebanon will "prevent Hezbollah and all other armed groups in the territory of Lebanon from carrying out any operations against Israel". Meanwhile, Israel will "not carry out any offensive military operations against Lebanese targets, including civilian, military, or other state targets, in the territory of Lebanon".The Lebanese government has tasked the army with establishing a state monopoly on arms, a decision which Hezbollah has said it will disregard.IsraelHezbollahLebanonRelatedTrump says he 'will not allow' Netanyahu to annex West BankIsraeli strike on Yemen's Houthis reportedly kills eightPalestinians in West Bank stranded as Israel shuts only international crossingMore from the BBC2 Sep 2025Body seen in secret mortuary could solve 50-year mystery of vanished religious leaderCompelling evidence to suggest Lebanese Shia leader Musa al-Sadr was killed in Libya is uncovered by BBC.2 Sep 202528 Aug 2025Irish peacekeepers to withdraw from Lebanon by 2027The UN says the almost 50-year mission will come to an end in 2027, as 300 Irish peacekeepers still stationed in south Lebanon.28 Aug 202512 Aug 2025Appeal lodged against sentences for killing of Irish soldierA man was sentenced to death in Lebanon over the killing of Pte Rooney last month. 12 Aug 20256 Aug 2025'A grave sin': Hezbollah dismisses Lebanon's move to restrict arms Lebanon's cabinet has said it wants to establish a state monopoly on arms by the end of the year. 6 Aug 20251 Aug 2025Mother of Irish soldier calls trial where man sentenced to death a 'sham'A man was sentenced to death in Lebanon on Monday over the killing of an Irish soldier on a UN peacekeeping mission.1 Aug 2025British Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseSubscription TermsAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
