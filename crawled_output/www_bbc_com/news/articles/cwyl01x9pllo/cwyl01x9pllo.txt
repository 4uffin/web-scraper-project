A source close to the mayor said Trump's politics sowed "fear and division".This latest war of words adds to the pair's feud, with Trump in 2019 calling the mayor "a stone-cold loser" and Sir Sadiq accusing him of stirring up far-right politics.Trump echoed his past attacks on the mayor's governing of London, calling him a "disaster" on immigration."I think the Mayor of London Khan is among the worst mayors in the world, and we have some bad ones," he said."I think he's done a terrible job. Crime in London is through the roof.""I asked that he not be there. He wanted to be there, as I understand, I didn't want him."In response, a source close to Sir Sadiq rejected Trump's assessment of the mayor's work."Trump's politics is one of fear and division. This includes talking down our great capital city," they said."London is a global success story - it's open, dynamic and safer than major US cities. Perhaps that's one of the reasons record numbers of Americans are choosing to make London their home."The pair's long-running row dates back to 2015 when the Labour politician condemned Trump's suggestion that Muslims should be banned from travelling to the US. A year later, Trump challenged the mayor to an IQ test.The US leader also attacked the mayor's handling of the London Bridge terror attack in 2017.During the US leader's first state visit in 2019, Sir Sadiq permitted a plan to fly a giant inflatable "Trump baby" blimp to coincide with his trip.In July, Trump took another swipe at the mayor during a press conference with Sir Keir Starmer in Scotland, calling Sir Sadiq a "nasty person", to which the prime minister interjected saying: "He's a friend of mine, actually."The US president's second state visit to the UK - unprecedented for a non-royal - was largely marked by pomp and ceremony to signal the warm relations between the two allies.However, thousands of protesters gathered in Parliament Square for a rally against the visit.Four men were arrested after images of Trump and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein were projected on to Windsor Castle ahead of the state banquet.Sarah Smith: Trump visit showed UK's warm relations - and limited influenceTrump suggests Starmer could use military to control UK bordersKey takeaways from Trump-Starmer news conferenceMayor of LondonDonald TrumpUK-US relationsSadiq KhanRelatedSir Sadiq Khan: Trump is racist and sexistTrump says London wants 'to go to sharia law'Mayor trials car-free Oxford Street for one day More from the BBC20 mins agoJimmy Kimmel's return draws record ratings despite limited showingThe first episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live! since it was suspended last week drew a record 6.26 million viewers, Disney says.20 mins ago32 mins agoColombia's president calls US attacks on alleged drug boats 'act of tyranny'Trump has said the airstrikes, which have reportedly killed 17, targeted drug-smuggling boats primarily from Venezuela.32 mins ago54 mins ago'There's no way we can afford $100,000': Small firms scramble over H-1B visa feesStartups and smaller firms could bear the brunt of Trump's new H-1B visa fee, and some fear it could thwart US innovation.54 mins ago5 hrs agoWatch: White House replaces President Biden portrait with image of an autopenPresident Donald Trump has previously claimed Biden used an autopen to sign important documents, including pardons.5 hrs ago5 hrs agoLuigi Mangione's lawyers claim Trump violated right to fair trial They say the US president's comments were "part of a greater political narrative that has no place in any criminal case".5 hrs agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
