Stephane Dujarric, spokesperson for UN Secretary General António Guterres, said the videographer reached the top of the escalator as the president and first lady mounted the steps at the bottom."At that moment (09:50am), the escalator came to a stop," Dujarric said. A readout of the machine's central processing unit "indicated that the escalator had stopped after a built-in safety mechanism on the comb step was triggered at the top of the escalator", he added. The White House has not yet commented on the UN's findings. After the escalator snafu, Trump ran into more technical difficulties as he began his speech to the UN General Assembly.He opened by saying the teleprompter was not working - although it was restored towards the end of his address. "I can only say that whoever's operating this teleprompter is in big trouble," he said. A UN official later told the BBC the White House was operating the teleprompter at the time, bringing their own laptops and plugging them into the UN's system.The official said this was because they would know the speed at which to run the text for the president.Six years ago Trump's UN audience laughed, this year they were silentTrump says Kyiv can win back 'all of Ukraine' after talks with ZelenskyTrump criticises countries' migration and climate policies in scathing UN speechMelania TrumpUnited NationsDonald TrumpRelatedDonald Trump's second UK state visit: Here's what we knowMelania’s hat, a yellow dress and Kate’s golden gown - standout state visit looksMelania Trump warns 'robots are here' in rare public outingMore from the BBC55 mins agoJimmy Kimmel's return draws record ratings despite limited showingThe first episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live! since it was suspended last week drew a record 6.26 million viewers, Disney says.55 mins ago1 hr agoColombia's president calls US attacks on alleged drug boats 'act of tyranny'Trump has said the airstrikes, which have reportedly killed 17, targeted drug-smuggling boats primarily from Venezuela.1 hr ago2 hrs ago'There's no way we can afford $100,000': Small firms scramble over H-1B visa feesStartups and smaller firms could bear the brunt of Trump's new H-1B visa fee, and some fear it could thwart US innovation.2 hrs ago4 hrs agoSyrian leader addresses UN General Assembly for first time in almost 60 yearsSyrian president Ahmed Al-Sharaa became the first representative of Syria to address world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly for almost sixty years. 4 hrs ago5 hrs agoWatch: White House replaces President Biden portrait with image of an autopenPresident Donald Trump has previously claimed Biden used an autopen to sign important documents, including pardons.5 hrs agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
