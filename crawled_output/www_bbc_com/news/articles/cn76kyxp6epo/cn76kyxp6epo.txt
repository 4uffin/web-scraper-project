Stephane Dujarric, spokesperson for UN Secretary General António Guterres, said the videographer reached the top of the escalator as the president and first lady mounted the steps at the bottom."At that moment (09:50am), the escalator came to a stop," Dujarric said. A readout of the machine's central processing unit "indicated that the escalator had stopped after a built-in safety mechanism on the comb step was triggered at the top of the escalator", he added. The White House has not yet commented on the UN's findings. After the escalator snafu, Trump ran into more technical difficulties as he began his speech to the UN General Assembly.He opened by saying the teleprompter was not working - although it was restored towards the end of his address. "I can only say that whoever's operating this teleprompter is in big trouble," he said. A UN official later told the BBC the White House was operating the teleprompter at the time, bringing their own laptops and plugging them into the UN's system.The official said this was because they would know the speed at which to run the text for the president.Six years ago Trump's UN audience laughed, this year they were silentTrump says Kyiv can win back 'all of Ukraine' after talks with ZelenskyTrump criticises countries' migration and climate policies in scathing UN speechMelania TrumpUnited NationsDonald TrumpRelatedDonald Trump's second UK state visit: Here's what we knowMelania’s hat, a yellow dress and Kate’s golden gown - standout state visit looksMelania Trump warns 'robots are here' in rare public outingMore from the BBC7 mins agoFormer FBI director James Comey indicted on two chargesJames Comey says he is innocent after being accused of lying to Congress in 2020 while testifying about leaks to the media.7 mins ago25 mins agoTrump announces new tariffs on drugs, trucks and kitchen cabinetsThe US president said the move aims to help protect American manufacturers from foreign imports.25 mins ago4 hrs agoTrump claims a TikTok deal is done.
