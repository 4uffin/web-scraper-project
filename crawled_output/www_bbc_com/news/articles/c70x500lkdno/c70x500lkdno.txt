I can't finance next year and I can't cover the cost of food and drink," Mr Haddad told the BBC.With two teenage daughters to feed, he is now borrowing money from relatives to survive.Mr Haddad's struggle is echoed across Syria, where the worst drought in 36 years has slashed wheat harvests by 40% and is pushing a country - where nearly 90% of the population already lives in poverty - to the brink of a wider food crisis.A report from the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates Syria will face a wheat shortfall of 2.73m tonnes this year, the equivalent of annual dietary needs for 16.25 million people.Maher HaddadFarmer Maher Haddad said the drought had been disastrous for his cropsWithout more food aid or the ability to import wheat, Syria's hunger crisis is set to worsen dramatically, warned Piro Tomaso Perri, FAO's senior programme officer for Syria."Food insecurity could reach unprecedented levels by late 2025 into mid-2026," he said, noting that more than 14 million Syrians - six in 10 people - are already struggling to eat enough. Of those, 9.1 million face acute hunger, including 1.3 million in severe conditions, while 5.5 million risk sliding into crisis without urgent intervention.The same report showed rainfall has dropped by nearly 70%, crippling 75% of Syria's rain-fed farmland."This is the difference between families being able to stay in their communities or being forced to migrate," Mr Perri said. "For urban households, it means rising bread prices. For rural families, it means the collapse of their livelihoods."Farming families are already selling livestock to supplement lost incomes from wheat, reducing their number of daily meals, and there has been a rise in malnutrition rates among children and pregnant women.Yet, the implications of the drought stretch far beyond the thousands of kilometres of barren farmlands.Wheat is a staple crop in Syria. It is the main ingredient for bread and pasta - two food staples that should be low cost foods to families. So with the lack of wheat supply, the cost goes up.For 39-year-old widow Sanaa Mahamid, affording bread has become a massive struggle.With six children between the ages of nine and 20, she relies on the wages of two sons, but their salaries are not enough to cover the family's basic expenses."Sometimes we borrow money just to buy bread," she said.EPASyria is relying more heavily on wheat imports, including shipments from RussiaLast year, a bag of bread cost Sanna 500 Syrian pounds ($4.1; £3; €3.5), but now it is 4,500 Syrian pounds. To feed her family, Sanaa needs two bags a day - an expense of 9,000 pounds, before accounting for any other food."This is too much. This is just bread, and we still need other things," she said. "If the price of bread rises again, this will be a big problem. The most important thing is bread."The crisis is a challenge for interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa, as his administration works to rebuild Syria in the aftermath of the 14-year conflict and the removal of former leader Bashar al-Assad in December 2024.International agencies, like the UN World Food Programme (WFP), are rushing to step in alongside the government to provide bread subsidies for those at risk of facing severe food insecurity.But aid officials warn that subsidies are only a temporary fix, and that the long-term stability of Syria depends on whether farmers can stay on their land and sustain production."We're trying to keep people in the farming game," Marianne Ward, the WFP's country director for Syria, said. She has worked to give $8m (£6m;
€6.9m) in direct payments to small farmers - about 150,000 people - who lost all of their crops."If you're not going to make money, you're going to leave the land. And then you're not going to have people who are going to be working in the agriculture sector which is essential for the economy," she saidBut after more than a decade of war, Syria's agricultural sector was already battered by economic collapse, destroyed irrigation systems, and mined fields.Dr Ali Aloush, the agriculture director for the Deir al-Zour region, Syria's breadbasket, said wheat fields needed to be irrigated four to six times per season, but that due to lack of rain, most farmers could not keep up."The farmer's primary concern is first securing water and water requires fuel. The fuel price skyrocketed. It reached to 11,000 to 12,000 Syrian pounds per litre," Dr Aloush said.The high price of fuel and power cuts meant water pumps were out of reach, and many growers were already burdened with debt.Dr Aloush says a priority for his department and the transitional government in Damascus is putting money into irrigation projects - like solar powered drips - that will make water more accessible to farmers.But projects like that take time and money - luxuries wheat farmers do not currently have.So for millions of Syrians across the country, there is only one thing to do in the coming months: pray for rain.Additional reporting by Lana Antaki in DamascusDroughtSyriaRelatedReservoir levels rise for first time since JanuaryReservoir levels below 40% after scorching summerWater firm bans tankers from transporting water for billionaire's lakeMore from the BBC10 Sep 2025How Syria's dictatorship used a global child welfare charity to 'disappear' childrenThe Assad regime used an international charity to hide children of detainees from their families.10 Sep 20259 Sep 2025Syria accuses Israel of carrying out air strikesSyria's Foreign Ministry condemned the strikes as "a blatant infringement" of its sovereignty.9 Sep 202528 Aug 2025Israeli strikes kill six Syrian troops, Syria saysThe Israeli military declined to comment on reports of the strikes, which Syria condemned.28 Aug 202515 Aug 2025War crimes likely committed in Syria coastal violence, UN saysA UN commission found war crimes were "likely" committed by former regime fighters and interim government force members in March.15 Aug 202522 Jul 2025'They shot patients in beds' – BBC hears claims of massacre at Suweida hospitalThe BBC visits Suweida's National Hospital where staff claim patients were killed by Syrian government forces.22 Jul 2025British Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
