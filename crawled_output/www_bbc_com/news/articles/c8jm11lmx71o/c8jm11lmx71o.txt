One male passenger died in hospital after being found seriously ill when the vessel was intercepted, according to police. Those on board included people from Senegal, Guinea, Mali, Gambia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea-Bissau, local media reported.All 19 suspects are in pretrial detention facing charges of facilitating irregular immigration, homicide, assault and torture.Spain is one of the frontline entry points for irregular migration into Europe, with most entering via the Canary Islands.Almost 47,000 migrants reached the archipelago in 2024, setting a record for a second year, but numbers have been far lower so far this year, the Spanish Interior Ministry said.Small boat migrant crossings hit 50,000 under LabourHow many people cross the Channel in small boats?SpainEurope migrant crisisMigrationRelatedSpain counts the cost of 'nightmare' wildfire summerSpanish PM calls for Israel to be barred from international sportFamily's anger as Benidorm death ruled accidentalMore from the BBC3 hrs agoMinister rejects Trump's call for military to tackle illegal migrationUS President Donald Trump suggested the military could help tackle illegal migration to the UK. 3 hrs ago9 hrs agoMigrant returned to France after government wins court challengeEritrean man arrives in Paris under the "one in, one out" deal as at least three boats carrying migrants leave beaches in France. 9 hrs ago1 day agoTrump suggests Starmer could use military to control UK bordersThe US president says illegal migration "destroys countries from within", as his two-day state visit to the UK comes to a close.1 day ago2 days agoGovernment to appeal against ruling blocking migrant deportation to FranceHome Secretary Shabana Mahmood says attempts to block removals "are intolerable" and threaten the government's plans.2 days ago2 days agoIs the UK-France migrants returns deal workable?An Eritrean man managed to temporarily block his removal to France - is the government facing a stumbling block or a more serious problem?2 days agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
