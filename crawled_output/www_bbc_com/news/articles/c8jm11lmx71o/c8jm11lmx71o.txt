One male passenger died in hospital after being found seriously ill when the vessel was intercepted, according to police. Those on board included people from Senegal, Guinea, Mali, Gambia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea-Bissau, local media reported.All 19 suspects are in pretrial detention facing charges of facilitating irregular immigration, homicide, assault and torture.Spain is one of the frontline entry points for irregular migration into Europe, with most entering via the Canary Islands.Almost 47,000 migrants reached the archipelago in 2024, setting a record for a second year, but numbers have been far lower so far this year, the Spanish Interior Ministry said.Small boat migrant crossings hit 50,000 under LabourHow many people cross the Channel in small boats?SpainEurope migrant crisisMigrationRelatedSpain counts the cost of 'nightmare' wildfire summerSpanish PM calls for Israel to be barred from international sportFamily's anger as Benidorm death ruled accidentalMore from the BBC26 mins agoHome Office loses bid to overturn court order blocking migrant's removalIt comes after the removal of an Eritrean man who arrived on a small boat was blocked at the last minute.26 mins ago1 day agoReform plans to scrap indefinite leave to remain for migrantsThe party says scrapping the scheme and restricting migrant access to benefits will save hundreds of billions of pounds. 1 day ago3 days agoMore than 1,000 people cross Channel in one dayThe number of people who have made the crossing in 2025 is 32,103, a record for this point in a year.3 days ago4 days agoMinister rejects Trump's call for military to tackle illegal migrationUS President Donald Trump suggested the military could help tackle illegal migration to the UK. 4 days ago4 days agoMigrant returned to France after government wins court challengeEritrean man arrives in Paris under the "one in, one out" deal as at least three boats carrying migrants leave beaches in France. 4 days agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
