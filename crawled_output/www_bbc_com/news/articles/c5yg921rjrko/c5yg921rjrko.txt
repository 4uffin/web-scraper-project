The Ukrainian leader also warned that Europe cannot afford to lose Moldova - which lies between Ukraine and EU-member Romania - to Russian influence. He said the West had missed a chance to save Georgia and Belarus from Putin's orbit.On Thursday the pro-EU president of Moldova, Maia Sandu, accused the Kremlin of "pouring hundreds of millions of euros" into Moldova in an attempt to instigate violence and spread fear.Voters in the former Soviet republic go to the polls on Sunday, amid what a BBC investigation found to be a barrage of disinformation spread by a network with ties to Moscow.Last week, Estonia and Poland requested a consultation with other Nato members after Russia violated its airspace in separate incidents. Romania, another Nato member, also said Russian drones breached its airspace.Estonia seeks Nato consultation after Russian jets violate airspaceUkraine in maps: Tracking the war with RussiaUkraine says three killed in 'massive' Russian aerial attackEarlier on Tuesday, following his speech to the UN, Trump said Nato nations should shoot down Russian planes breaching their airspace, following the recent incursions by Russian fighter jets and drones.Zelensky praised Donald Trump and said he had a "good meeting" with the US president.On Tuesday, he told reporters he understood the US was willing to give Ukraine security guarantees after the war is finished. Pressed on what this would look like, he said he did not have specific details but broached the possibility of more weapons, air defences and drones.Trump's suggestion on Tuesday that Kyiv could win, with support from the EU and Nato, marked an apparent U-turn after his previous comments that Ukraine would have to accept "land swaps" as a condition of peace.The US president also described Russia as a "paper tiger" that had been "fighting aimlessly in Ukraine." Kremlin spokesman Dimitry Peskov responded: "Russia is in no way a tiger. It's more associated with a bear. And there is no such thing as a paper bear."Peskov told reporters the US president had made the comments "apparently under the influence of the vision put forward by Zelensky"."This vision is in absolute contrast with our understanding of the current state of affairs."US Secretary of State Marco Rubio held a meeting with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov on Wednesday, marking the highest-level US encounter with Russia since Trump invited Putin to Alaska last month.According to a brief statement from the US State Department, Rubio reiterated Trump's "call for the killing to stop and the need for Moscow to take meaningful steps toward a durable resolution of the Russia-Ukraine war".The Kremlin did not immediately comment on the meeting.
