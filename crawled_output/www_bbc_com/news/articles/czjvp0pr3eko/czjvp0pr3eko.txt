Out of 33 cases launched since its inception, all but one involved an African country.A country's withdrawal from the ICC officially takes effect one year after the UN is notified.Military junta forces are in control of Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger, following coups in the Sahel countries between 2020 and 2023. They make up the only three members of the Confederation of Sahel States.Their armies have faced accusations of crimes against civilians, as violence has escalated in the region against jihadist groups linked to al-Qaeda and the Islamic State.In another coordinated move earlier this year, all three countries simulatenously withdrew from the regional bloc, the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas).They had rejected Ecowas' demands for them to restore democratic rule.Russia has strengthened its ties with the three Sahel countries over recent years, which have all become increasingly isolated from the West, notably the former regional colonial power France.In 2023, the ICC issued an arrest warrant for Russia's President Vladimir Putin over alleged war crimes in Ukraine.Burkina FasoInternational Criminal CourtMaliNigerAfricaRelatedBurkina Faso scraps visa fees for African travellers Burkina Faso's parliament votes to outlaw homosexual actsBurkina Faso's junta expels top UN official over child rights reportMore from the BBC9 mins agoMore than 80 buffaloes drown in Namibia after falling off cliffThe herd was fleeing lions, officials say9 mins ago2 hrs agoEswatini says it has repatriated US deportee to JamaicaOrville Isaac Etoria had been held in prison in the southern African state after Trump's government expelled him.2 hrs ago5 hrs agoMalawi ex-president takes clear lead in vote-count, results showPeter Mutharika has got about 66% of the votes counted so far, putting him ahead of President Lazarus Chakwera.5 hrs ago19 hrs agoICC charges Rodrigo Duterte with crimes against humanity The former president of the Philippines is accused of being involved in the deaths of dozens of people. 19 hrs ago1 day ago'I'm Kenyan, don't shoot' - the athlete who says he was duped into the Russian armyEvans Kibet, now being held in Ukraine after surrendering, says he did not know he was signing up.1 day agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
