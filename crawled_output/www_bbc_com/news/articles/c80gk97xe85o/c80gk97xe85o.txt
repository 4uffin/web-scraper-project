More learners opt for automatics in tests5 days agoShareSaveEmer MoreauBusiness reporterShareSaveGetty ImagesThe number of people taking their driving test in an automatic car is rising every yearOne in four driving tests in Great Britain are being taken in automatic cars, according to new data, as drivers opt for more electric vehicles (EVs) and shy away from manual gearboxes.Figures from the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) show that 470,000 of the 1.8 million driving tests taken in England, Scotland, and Wales last year were done in automatics.Insurer AA said the trend is being driven by the UK's ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars coming in 2030, as EVs do not need manual gearboxes.Emma Bush, the managing director of AA's driving school, said the need to know how to drive a manual car was becoming "irrelevant to many".To obtain a full driving licence for Great Britain a driver must pass their test in a car with manual gears.If the test is taken in an automatic car, the driver would get a Category B Auto licence, restricting them to driving vehicles with automatic transmission only.Northern Ireland issues its own driving licences.Ms Bush said that drivers and learners were "becoming confident with the idea of their driving future being electric"."As we head closer to 2030 and the ban on the sale of new combustion cars, more and more learners will want to learn in an electric vehicle as that's all they will plan to drive."Following the general election last year, the Labour government pledged to restore the petrol and diesel ban to 2030, after previous Prime Minister Rishi Sunak pushed it back to 2035.The lower day-to-day running costs of EVs and hybrids is also attractive to many, Ms Bush said.EVs can be significantly more expensive than a petrol or diesel car or a hybrid upfront, but the gap is narrowing.Additionally, EV owners can expect to save money on fuel and maintenance costs.Sue Howe, the owner of Sue's Driving School in Swindon, told the BBC that automatics were "the way forward" as the car industry moves towards EVs.Sue HoweDriving instructor Sue Howe says automatics are the way forwardFor learner drivers, Ms Howe said, automatics can make the test easier, as "there's just a lot less to do".Inexperienced drivers can "wreck a gearbox and a clutch", Ms Howe said, adding that nerves may cause them to stall or cut out the engine.She also said the trend was good for road safety as "people are less tired" driving an automatic."It just makes life so much easier - it's less work for the driver to do so they can concentrate more time on the road."Drivers' attitudes to EVs have rapidly changed over the last decade.The number of driving tests taken in automatics was 87,844 in 2012/13, or 6% of all tests, according to the DVSA figures.That figure jumped to 479,556 in 2024/25, the last period with complete data, or 26%.The AA is predicting that 29% of all tests will be taken in automatics in 2025/26.The figures from the DVSA also showed that more men are opting to take their tests in automatics.In 2012/13, some 23% of learners taking tests in automatics were men. Last year, that figure was 39%.The pass rate for automatics last year was slightly lower than for manuals. However, the gap has narrowed since 2012.More on this storyHow will the petrol and diesel car ban work?Driving test delays 'worst they have ever been'CompaniesUK driving licenceMotoringCar industryRelatedNext warns UK economy faces 'anaemic' growthCould the US interest rate cut boost the housing market?JLR could face disruption until November after hackMore from the BBC19 hrs agoJLR shutdown a 'wake up call' for cyber resilienceProfessor David Bailey says the government may need to support firms in the JLR supply chain.19 hrs ago2 days ago'Labour must step up to help JLR supply chain'Unite the Union has called on the government to implement a furlough scheme for supply chain workers.2 days ago3 days agoMPs write to government over JLR supply chain jobsWest Midlands and Merseyside MPs have called for supply chain help after the JLR cyber attack.3 days ago3 days ago'Booking a driving test?
