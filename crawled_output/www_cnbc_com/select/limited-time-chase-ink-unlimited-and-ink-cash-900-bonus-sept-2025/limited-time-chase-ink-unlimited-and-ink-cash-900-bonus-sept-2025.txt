However, the Ink Business Cash card has altered its requirement. It was a tiered bonus you could earn over six months, so it required less spending per month. The offer was smaller, but it was easier to earn.
The new deals match the largest welcome bonuses we've seen for these cards. So, if you've had your eye on either, now is a the time to apply.Don't forget, you can boost the value of these bonuses if you pair these cards with a Chase credit card that allows transfers to the Ultimate Rewards travel partners. So if you have (or plan to get) a card like the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card (see rates and fees) or Ink Business Preferred Credit Card (see rates and fees), these offers are even more valuable.Chase Sapphire Preferred® CardCNBC Select Rating 5.0 Learn MoreOn Chase's site CNBC Select Rating 5.0 Learn MoreOn Chase's site SpotlightWith Points Boost, your rewards will be worth up to 1.5x on thousands of top-booked hotels and flights from select airlines through Chase Travel.Credit scoreGood to Excellent670–850Regular APR19.99% - 28.24% variableAnnual fee$95Welcome bonusEarn 75,000 bonus pointsSee rates and fees.

You'll also need to have an eligible business, but that may be easier than you think.You don't need a startup or even a full-time venture — a side hustle, freelance gig or independent contractor position can be enough to qualify for a business card.
These cards are usually subject to the unofficial Chase 5/24 rule, which makes it more difficult to get approved for a Chase card if you've opened five or more credit cards from any bank in the past 24 months. Keep in mind, while these cards are affected by the 5/24 rule, they won't add to your 5/24 count because they're business credit cards and won't appear on your personal credit report.Intimidated by the business credit card application process?
