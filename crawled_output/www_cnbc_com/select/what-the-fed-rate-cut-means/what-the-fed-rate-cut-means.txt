What lowering the benchmark rate means for credit cards, student loans, mortgages and more.Updated Wed, Sep 17 2025Ryley AmondSEO Reporter, CNBC SelectDan AveryEditor, CNBC SelectShareShare Article via FacebookShare Article via TwitterShare Article via LinkedInShare Article via EmailThe Federal Reserve has lowered the  for the first time this year, dropping the benchmark indicator 25 basis points to a range of 4.00% to 4.25%.Following three reductions late in 2024, rates remained in the 4.25%–4.50% range throughout much of 2025.The highly anticipated move comes after government reports showing both more modest inflation pressure and a weaker job market.While the Fed doesn't directly control interest rates, it does determine what banks can charge each other when borrowing or lending excess reserves overnight. That, in turn, influences interest rates on everything from car loans to credit cards.The committee will meet again in October and December, and a majority of economists anticipate at least one more cut before the New Year, possibly more, according to a recent Bloomberg survey.How to take advantage of the Fed rate cutLowering the fed fund rate impacts the cost of borrowing and manifests in interest rates on credit cards, auto loans, mortgages and more. It also influences the yields savers receive on CDs, high-yield savings accounts and money market accounts."It affects everything a little differently and in different magnitudes," said Amy Hubble, principal investment advisor with Radix Financial.With that in mind, here are some financial steps to take to best benefit from today's rate cut — and any more to come.1. Pay off high-interest credit cardsToday's news may sound like a boon for consumers with big credit card bills, but a quarter-point reduction might only lower your APR by about half a percentage point.Instead of waiting for more cuts, consider opening a 0% intro APR balance transfer card to give yourself more time to pay off your balance interest-free. Wells Fargo Reflect® CardCNBC Select Rating 4.3 Learn MoreOn Wells Fargo's site CNBC Select Rating 4.3 Learn MoreOn Wells Fargo's site SpotlightThis card offers one of the longest introductory APR periods for purchases and balance transfers.Credit scoreGood to Excellent670–850Regular APR17.24%, 23.74% or 28.99% variable APRAnnual fee$0Welcome bonusNoneSee rates and fees.

It's an easy way to earn cash back as an account credit when you shop, dine, or enjoy an experience simply by using an eligible Wells Fargo credit card.Balance transfer fee5%, min: $5Foreign transaction fee3%At 21 months, the Wells Fargo Reflect® Card has one of the longest introductory 0% APR periods for purchases and balance transfers we've found. (After that, a variable 17.24%, 23.74% or 28.99% APR applies).Balance transfers made within 120 days qualify for the intro rate, but keep in mind that the balance transfer fee on the Reflect Card is 5% of each transfer (with a minimum of $5). Additionally, you should prioritize paying off the full balance quickly or you could be stuck with an even higher interest rate once the zero APR period ends.The Fed's move will also lower interest rates on personal loans, so now might be the time for a debt consolidation loan, which would replace your existing card balance with a lower, fixed rate.Looking to consolidate debt or make home improvements?

Refinance your student loansNearly 6 million Americans are at least three months behind on their federal student loan payments, according to a report from TransUnion, with approximately 2 million defaulting in September alone. A drop in the federal funds rate means interest rates on student loans will also decline. If you have newer loans and were hit with high rates, the next year or two may be a good time to refinance.Secure a lower monthly payment or better rate with these student loan options.Offers in this section are from affiliate partners and selected based on a combination of engagement, product relevance, compensation, and consistent availability.SoFi Student LoansEligible borrowersUndergraduate and graduate students, parents, health professionalsLoan amounts$5,000 minimum (or up to state); maximum up to cost of attendanceLoan terms5, 7, 10, 15,

Start house hunting againIf the Fed makes more cuts this year, it could go a long way toward thawing the frozen housing market.Mortgage rates are more closely linked to 10-year Treasury bond yields, but they're not immune.Read more: The best mortgages for first-time homebuyers"These rates may not necessarily move exactly in tandem with a reduction in the federal funds rate," said Hubble. "But it's still fair to assume that a lower fund rate will also mean a lower mortgage rate."As of Sept. 11, the average rate for a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage was 6.35%, according to the Federal Reserve of St. Louis. While nowhere near the  borrowers enjoyed during the pandemic, it's a notable decline from January, when the average mortgage rate topped 7%. Online mortgage lenders can often help homebuyers with lower interest rates and faster closing timesOffers in this section are from affiliate partners and selected based on a combination of engagement, product relevance, compensation, and consistent availability.Better MortgageTerms10–30 yearsMinimum credit score620Minimum down payment5% for conventional loans, 3.5% for FHA loans, 0% for VA loans, 10.01% for jumbo loanLEARN MORERocket MortgageTerms10, 15 or 30 years for fixed-term conventional loans, 30-year VA and FHA loans.

Save smarterThe Federal funds rate is directly linked to the yield savers get on CDs, high-yield savings accounts, and other products. It costs banks more to borrow when the Fed raises its rate, so they make deposits more appealing to consumers.When the benchmark declines, there's less need for reserves. As a result, returns decrease almost immediately.Read more: The best high-yield savings accountsEven if a certificate of deposit or high-yield savings account drops below 4%, though, that's still an exponentially stronger return than what you'll get with traditional savings accounts. They're hovering around 0.39%, according to FDIC data.A CD, in particular, would let you lock in today's interest rate for months or even years, regardless of future rate declines.Competitive APYs are available through CDs offered by these issuers.Offers in this section are from affiliate partners and selected based on a combination of engagement, product relevance, compensation, and consistent availability.Discover CDsAnnual Percentage Yield (APY)From 2.00% to 4.00% APYLEARN MOREDiscover Bank is a Member FDIC.Bread Savings™ (formerly Comenity Direct) CDsAnnual Percentage Yield (APY)From 3.80% to 4.45% APYTermsFrom 1 year to 5 yearsLEARN MOREBread Savings™ (formerly Comenity Direct) is a product of Comenity Capital Bank, a Member FDIC.Interest rates FAQWhen will interest rates go down again?The last two Federal Open Market Committee meetings of 2025 are scheduled for Oct. 28-29 and Dec 9-10.

It dictates the interest that commercial banks charge each other to lend extra reserves overnight. That, in turn, impacts the rates these institutions charge for credit cards, loans and other financial products.How much will the Fed lower rates in 2025?According to Reuters' poll, 60% of economists expect the benchmark rate to decrease another 25 basis points by the end of 2025, while 37% predict a larger 50-basis-point decline before the year's end.Subscribe to the CNBC Select Newsletter!Money matters — so make the most of it.
