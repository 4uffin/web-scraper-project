Additionally, it doesn't require a credit check for approval, and there are no late fees or interest."We're building on top of the everyday banking features our members already rely on, to make the Chime experience even more rewarding," Chime co-founder Ryan King said in a statement. "We've kept the benefits people value most and removed the mandatory fees and barriers they don't."Chime Card™Learn MoreOn Chime's site Learn MoreOn Chime's site Credit scoreN/ARegular APRNoneAnnual fee$0Welcome bonusNoneTerms apply.Pros & cons1.5% cash back rewards for Chime+ membersNo annual feeNo credit check or minimum security depositCard holders get 3.75% APY on a Chime savings account Card access paused if statement balance is not paid within 24 hours.More detailsRewards1.5% cash back on rotating categoriesForeign transaction feeNoneCash back with no fees or interestThe Chime Card offers 1.5% cash back in rotating categories, such as gas, groceries, restaurants and utility bills, to cardholders who have made a qualifying direct deposit of $200 or more into a Chime Checking Account within the past 34 days.There are no annual fees, maintenance fees or international transaction fees with the Chime Card. There is also no interest or late fees for missed payments.However, failing to pay your statement balance on time will pause your ability to make new purchases and could be reported to the credit bureaus.Safe credit-building for everyoneThe Chime Card doesn't require a credit check to open, making it a good option for people with poor credit or a thin credit history.But it works differently from other secured cards: If you're approved, you'll also get a Chime Checking Account and a Chime Secured Deposit Account. Funds added to your checking account are automatically transferred to the Secured Deposit Account, which acts as collateral and determines your spending limit.You can use the money in your Secured Deposit Account to pay off your balance automatically every month, or make manual payments from any bank account. The unique structure helps reduce your risk of accumulating too much debt.In addition, your card activity is reported to all three credit bureaus, which can help you build a positive credit history.Final thoughtsThe Chime Card, which replaces the Chime Credit Builder Secured Visa® Credit Card*, offers consumers a new way to build credit while earning rewards. It's the latest addition to the online bank's suite of products and features, which include a high-yield savings account, free overdraft protection through SpotMe and early access to paychecks with MyPay.Subscribe to the CNBC Select Newsletter!Money matters — so make the most of it.
