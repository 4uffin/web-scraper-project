Lock in 4.45% APY todayAll signs point to these being the best rates you'll find for the foreseeable future.Updated 3 Hours AgoDavid McMillinReporter, CNBC SelectShareShare Article via FacebookShare Article via TwitterShare Article via LinkedInShare Article via EmailThinking about opening a certificate of deposit? You're not alone, especially if you're just starting your savings journey. According to a new survey by Santander Bank, 74% of Gen Z is interested in locking in a CD before rates decline.There's not much time left, though: All signs point to a reduction in the federal funds rate when the Federal Reserve meets on September 16 and 17.When that happens, returns on CDs decline, almost immediately. That's because the Fed cuts the Federal funds rate, which dictates the interest financial institutions charge each other when borrowing to meet their reserve requirements.When the Fed raises its benchmark rate, it costs banks more to borrow and they require more customer deposits to fund operations. That's when the Annual Percentage Yield (APY) on CDs is most lucrative. There's less need for reserves if the Fed cuts rates, so CD yields take a tumble.With the next Fed announcement scheduled for Wednesday, there's little daylight before the next likely rate drop.Competitive APYs are available through CDs offered by these issuers.Offers in this section are from affiliate partners and selected based on a combination of engagement, product relevance, compensation, and consistent availability.Discover CDsAnnual Percentage Yield (APY)From 2.00% to 4.00% APYLEARN MOREDiscover Bank is a Member FDIC.Bread Savings™ (formerly Comenity Direct) CDsAnnual Percentage Yield (APY)From 3.80% to 4.45% APYTermsFrom 1 year to 5 yearsLEARN MOREBread Savings™ (formerly Comenity Direct) is a product of Comenity Capital Bank, a Member FDIC.Bread Financial is still offering up to 4.45% APY on six-month CDs, the best rates we've been able to confirm. And while it has a $1,500 minimum opening deposit requirement, the online bank doesn't charge a monthly maintenance fee.You can earn up to 4.00% APY with Discover Bank, and its terms range from 3 months to 10 years.CD rates have already started to declineSome 1-year CD rates are still hovering at or are slightly above the 4% mark, but there were better deals on the market 12 months ago. That's because many banks and credit unions are already gearing up for a Fed rate cut, according to Elliot Pepper, director of tax at Northbrook Financial."The rate for CDs is already adjusted based on market expectations of future rate cuts," Pepper told CNBC Select. "For example, a 12-month CD from Capital One is currently yielding 4.20%, but a 36-month CD from Capital One is currently yielding only 3.60%. This shows how the market is already factoring in rate cut expectations."Still, Pepper points out, "an actual Fed rate cut will solidify current expectations and may further lower rates." The drop may get a lot steeperAll eyes may be on what happens this week, but that's not the only date on the calendar you should circle if you're focused on smart money moves. The Federal Reserve will meet again in October and December, and more rate cuts seem likely.In a Sept. 11 Reuters survey of more than 100 economists, the vast majority expected a 50-basis-point reduction by the end of 2025. If that happens, we could see a 4% return on a 1-year CD replaced by 3.5% as the new standard. If the fed fund rate drops by 75 basis points, we could be looking at returns of 3.25% in 2026The lesson is simple: Act now to lock in the best earning potential. What to think about before opening a CDYou're on a tight timeline to secure the best CD rates, but it's still important to consider these key points.Are you comfortable leaving the cash untouched? Traditional CDs typically come with early withdrawal penalties if you decide to access funds before the maturity date. If you're concerned, consider a no-penalty CD. The rates will be slightly lower, but you'll have peace of mind. Consider building a CD ladder. A CD ladder allows you to spread out cash over multiple term lengths. For example, instead of putting $10,000 in a 1-year CD, you might spread that money across a 6-month CD, a 9-month CD, a 1-year CD and an 18-month CD. With this approach, you'll be able to access some of the funds on a regular basis with the flexibility to pursue other savings and investing strategies.Steer clear of bump-up CDs. Some banks and credit unions are still offering bump-up CDs, which allow you to increase your fixed rate if a higher one becomes available. That may sound appealing, but there's no sign that rates will increase in the foreseeable future.Subscribe to the CNBC Select Newsletter!Money matters — so make the most of it.
