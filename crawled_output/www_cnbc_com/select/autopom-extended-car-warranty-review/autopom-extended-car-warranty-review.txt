(Its unusual name is an acronym for “automotive peace of mind.”) Today, it administers contracts and claims for Mercury Insurance Group, Bee Covered, Integrity and Royal Administration, among others.While its offerings are limited to three coverage tiers, the company boasts a strong reputation for customer service, with an A+ rating from the Better Business Bureau and high scores from Trustpilot and Google Reviews. Each policyholder is assigned a designated customer service agent, which is one reason we named Autopom “best for customer satisfaction” on our list of the best extended car warranties. autopom!

Available for newer models with low mileage.Mid-level: Available for: mid-mileage automobiles, this policy covers listed components in major car systems: Engine, transmission, drive axle, steering, brakes, A/C and electrical. Some plans also include suspension, cooling and fuel components.Powertrain Essentials: Intended for older, higher-mileage vehicles, this plan covers the engine, transmission and drive axle. The A/C and basic electrical components are included in some plans.Read: CNBC Select's picks for the best extended car warrantiesAutopom requirementsTo apply for a service contract with Autopom, you’ll need your vehicle’s make and model, its current mileage and the vehicle identification number (VIN).Age and mileage limitsAutopom covers vehicles with up to 150,000 miles on the odometer.Waiting periodMost extended warranty companies impose waiting periods to ensure a vehicle is in good working condition. Autopom typically has a 30-day, 1,000-mile waiting period; however, certain vehicles may have waiting periods of 60 or 90 days.DeductiblesAutopom’s standard deductible for any repair is $100. Claims processYou can take your vehicle to any ASE-certified repair shop or dealership and provide them with your contract number and claims administrator's phone number to get approval for any repairs. If the repairs are covered, the claims administrator for your plan will make payment directly to the shop or dealership, minus the $100 deductible, which you pay upon pickup. What is mechanical breakdown insurance?Similar to an extended car warranty, mechanical breakdown insurance (MBI) covers unexpected mechanical or electrical issues that occur after your manufacturer's warranty has expired. Our top picks include Geico and AAA.The primary difference is that MBI is typically available as an add-on to your. Additionally, while extended car warranties are available for older or higher-mileage cars, MBI is typically limited to newer vehicles.How much does Autopom cost?For a four-year Exclusionary policy on a 2021 Ford Escape with 50,000 miles, we were quoted a price of $120 per month for 30 months, or $3,600, including a down payment of $189. How does Autopom compare?Here’s how Autopom stacks up against two major extended vehicle warranty companies.Autopom vs. EnduranceEndurance Extended Car WarrantyLearn MorePolicy highlightsSix tiers of coverage with no mileage restrictions. Benefits include coverage for tire and windshield (from road hazards), key fob replacement, roadside assistance and 30-day cancellation policy. Advantage plan covers maintenance, which is typically excluded.EligibilityUp to 20 years old with no mileage capCoverage termsCovers up to 8 years or 200,000 milesChoose your garage?YesAvailabilityEndurance offers car warranties in all U.S. states except Massachusetts. In California, policies are sold as mechanical breakdown insurance.ProsNo mileage cap for approvalAdministers its own plans and claimsCovers tire damage from road hazardsAdvantage plan includes maintenance (oil change, brake pad replacements)Plans are transferable if you sell your vehicle. ConsHigher premiums than some competitorsLearn MoreView MoreWhile both companies offer perks like roadside assistance and limited tire repair, Endurance has twice as many plan options as Autopom, ranging from a bare-bones policy to comprehensive coverage.Endurance is also a direct-to-consumer provider, which means that it administers its own policies. That can make the claims process a lot easier. However, the cost of coverage tends to run higher than with Autopom.If you have an older car with more wear and tear, Endurance might be the better option: it has no mileage limit, while Autopom caps approved vehicles at 150,000 miles.Autopom vs. CarChexCarchex Extended Car WarrantyLearn MorePolicy highlightsFive plans, all with a 30-day money-back guarantee, towing, rental car reimbursement and trip interruption benefits. Contracts administered by Allegiance, American Auto Shield and othersEligibilityUp to 20 years old or 250,000 milesCoverage termsUp to 10 years or 250,000 miles.Choose your garage?Yes.AvailabilityCarChex plans are available in all 50 U.S. states and Washington, D.C.ProsOutstanding industry reputation30-day money-back guaranteePositive customer reviewsRental car benefits include rideshare servicesConsNo RV or motorcycle coverageLearn MoreView MoreBoth Autopom and CarChex are extended vehicle warranty brokers, meaning your claims and contracts are handled by a third party. However, Autopom is highly praised for its standout customer service and streamlined claims process, with a dedicated customer service representative assigned to each policyholder.While CarChex may cost more, it tends to offer more — more coverage levels, more deductible options and more flexibility with mileage. (It accepts vehicles with up to 250,000 miles, compared to Autopom’s 150,000-mile ceiling.) If keeping costs down is a priority, however, Autopom is a solid option. How do I buy an Autopom extended car warranty?You can get an online quote from Autopom
by providing your name, address, phone number and email on the Autopom website, along with your vehicle's year, make, model, mileage and VIN. An Autopom rep will call you back with a price quote.You can also call Autopom directly at 800-724-8141, Monday through Friday from 11 am ET to 8 pm ET, Is Autopom right for me?Autopom is recognized for its outstanding customer service, offering each policyholder a dedicated agent and the flexibility to have their vehicle repaired at any ASE-certified garage or dealership.In addition to lower-than-average rates, Autopom offers a variety of discounts, including for seniors, veterans and policyholders who pay upfront. There are a limited number of service plans, however, and Autopom caps approved vehicles at 150,000 miles. If your ride has higher mileage, you’ll need to look elsewhere.Autopom FAQHow much does Autopom cost?For a four-year Exclusionary plan for a 2021 Ford Escape with 50,000 miles, we were quoted a rate of $120 per month for 30 months, with a down payment of $189.Does Autopom provide a rental car while my vehicle is being repaired?Yes, all Autopom plans include reimbursement for a loaner car if your vehicle is undergoing covered repairs. The rate is $35 a day for up to 6 days. Autopom also offers $75-a-day trip interruption reimbursement for food, lodging and other essentials if your car breaks down far from home. What does an Autopom contract not cover?Extended car warranties typically don’t cover standard maintenance, like oil changes and replacement brake pads and wiper blades. In addition, damage caused by a collision, severe weather, theft or vandalism won’t be covered by your Autopom contract.Can I cancel my Autopom service contract?You can end your contract at any time. If you cancel within the first 30 days, you will receive a full refund. After that, you’ll receive a prorated refund, minus any claims that Autopom has already paid. Subscribe to the CNBC Select Newsletter!Money matters —  so make the most of it.
