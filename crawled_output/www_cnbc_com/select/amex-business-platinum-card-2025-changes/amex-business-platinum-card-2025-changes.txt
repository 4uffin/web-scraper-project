That's a substantial spending requirement, but it's reasonable for many businesses.This is one of the highest welcome bonuses I've seen for the Amex Business Platinum card. To put that in perspective, 200,000 points can cover some serious business travel redemptions–multiple international business-class flights for client meetings or extended stays at premium hotels for conferences.Annual fee increaseThe annual fee for the Amex Business Platinum card is increasing from $695 to $895 (see rates and fees). This is a significant increase.The value of the card for cardholders largely depends on their ability to frequently utilize the credits for Dell, Adobe, hotels and Indeed. If your business regularly incurs these types of expenses and you travel often, the benefits may still make the cost worthwhile.For existing cardholders who opened accounts before Sept. 18, 2025, the new annual fee will take effect at their next renewal date on or after Dec. 2, 2025. Be sure to evaluate whether the benefits align with your actual business needs before agreeing to the higher annual fee.New Amex Business Platinum Card benefitsThe Business Platinum Card refresh introduces several card enhancements aimed at increasing its value proposition for business owners.Dramatically expanded hotel benefitsThe Business Platinum now includes significant hotel perks:$600 hotel credit: Get up to $300 in statement credits semi-annually for up to a total of $600 each calendar year on prepaid Fine Hotels + Resorts or The Hotel Collection bookings through Amex Travel using the Business Platinum Card (two-night minimum stay with The Hotel Collection).Premium hotel status: You can receive complimentary Leaders Club Sterling Status from The Leading Hotels of the World and enjoy upgrade opportunities (subject to availability), daily breakfast for two and other on-property perks (enrollment required).Improved earning ratesThe Amex Business Platinum now offers upgraded earning rates on key business spending:2X points on eligible purchases in select business categories, as well as on eligible purchases of $5,000 or more (up to $2 million of these purchases per calendar year)5X points on flights and prepaid hotels booked through AmexTravel.com1X points on all other purchasesHigh-spending perks For businesses with substantial card usage, American Express introduces up to $3,600 in additional statement credits available the following calendar year after spending $250,000 on eligible purchases: $1,200 Amex Travel online flight credit for flights booked on AmexTravel.com.$2,400 One AP® statement credit for monthly fees on American Express One AP, the company's digital accounts payable product.New employee card benefitsThe Business Platinum has upgraded its employee card perks and increased the cost:Employee Business Platinum Cards are available for an additional $400 per card annually (up from the current $350 annual fee; see rates and fees)Access to 30 Centurion Lounges for employees10 complimentary Delta Sky Club visits when flying eligible Delta flightsComplimentary Marriott Bonvoy Gold Elite status and Hilton Honors Gold statusEmployee Business Expense Card option with no annual fee, offering limited benefitsAmex Business Platinum Card benefits staying the sameThe Business Platinum Card retains its comprehensive existing benefit package, including:Up to $1,150 Dell Technologies Credit: Get up to $150 in statement credits on U.S. purchases directly with Dell Technologies, plus an additional $1,000 statement credit after spending $5,000 or more on those purchases in a calendar year (enrollment required).$250 Adobe Credit: Receive $250 in statement credits after spending $600 or more on U.S. purchases directly with Adobe per calendar year (enrollment required).Up to $360 in Indeed credits annually: Earn up to $90 back in statement credits per quarter for purchases made at Indeed.com (enrollment required).Up to $200 in annual Hilton credit: Receive up to $50 in statement credits back per quarter for purchases you make directly with Hilton (Hilton for Business membership required; enrollment required).Up to $120 in wireless credits annually: Earn up to $10 in statement credits back per month for purchases made directly with any U.S. wireless telephone provider (enrollment required).Up to $209 in CLEAR® Plus credit: Earn up to $209 in statement credits per calendar year for a Clear Plus membership (subject to auto-renewal; excluding applicable taxes and fees).Up to $200 in airline fee statement credits: Every calendar year, you can be reimbursed for up to $200 in airline fees charged by your selected qualifying airline (enrollment required).Up to $120 in trusted traveler program credits: Receive either a statement credit every 4 years after you apply for Global Entry ($120) or a statement credit every 4.5 years after you apply for a five-year membership for TSA PreCheck® (up to $85 through a TSA PreCheck official enrollment provider) and pay the application fee with your Business Platinum Card®.Comprehensive travel and purchase insurance, no foreign transaction fees and moreAlternative business cards to considerAnyone considering the refreshed Business Platinum Card should evaluate their spending patterns to see if the new benefits outweigh the cost.
