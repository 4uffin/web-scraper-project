OnDeck is one small business loan lender that we've ranked as best for same-day funding but this lender offers a lot more than just quick cash.Here's what else you need to know about OnDeck's small business loans.OnDeck small business loans reviewHow does OnDeck work?How much can you borrow with OnDeck?How much does OnDeck cost?OnDeck pros and consAlternatives to OnDeckFAQsSet aside money for future use in a savings account designed for businessOffers in this section are from affiliate partners and selected based on a combination of engagement, product relevance, compensation, and consistent availability.First Internet Bank Business Money Market SavingsAnnual Percentage Yield (APY)3.46% with a daily balance of $5,000,000 or below; 4.42% with a daily balance above $5,000,000Minimum deposit$100 to open accountLEARN MORELive Oak Business SavingsAnnual Percentage Yield (APY)3.15%Minimum depositNoneLEARN MOREHow does OnDeck work?OnDeckLearn MoreTypes of loansTerm loanLoan amounts$5,000 to $250,000TermsUp to 24 monthsCredit score 625RequirementsIn business for at least one year, with $100,000 annual revenue and a business bank accountTerms apply.ProsPotential for same-day funding for term loans up to $100,000Low minimum credit scoreFixed monthly paymentsConsDoesn't lend in Nevada, North Dakota or South DakotaEarly payment fee if you don't qualify for prepayment benefitLearn MoreView MoreOnDeck is just like any other loan provider: you submit an application for a specific loan amount and if you're approved, you receive an interest rate and time horizon for repaying the loan.OnDeck claims to offer an application that can be completed in minutes. From there, a loan advisor can help you figure out what loan options are right for you. They offer two types of funding options: a term loan and a line of credit.This lender lets you use the funding for a wide array of goals and reasons including purchasing inventory, payroll, renovations, marketing, cash flow stabilization, equipment upgrades, consolidating business debt and expanding your team.How much can you borrow with OnDeck?If you're applying for a line of credit with OnDeck, you can apply for amounts that range from $6K to $200K. If you're applying for a term loan, though, you can borrow as little as $5K and as much as $250K.You can receive up to $200K funded the same day as long as you checkout Monday through Friday before 10:30 AM ET. You should receive your funds by 5 PM local time the same day. How much does OnDeck cost?OnDeck charges an origination fee between 0% and 4% for term loans.OnDeck pros and consBefore you submit an OnDeck application, consider these pros and cons.ProsOffers instant funding for amounts between $1,000 and $10,000 for lines of creditSame-day funding is available for amounts up to $200KBorrow up to $250K for term loansConsiders credit scores as low as 625Can reapply for another loan after six months of repayment or after you've paid down at least 40% of your original loan, whichever comes firstRepayment terms of up to 24 monthsConsDoesn't lend to businesses in North DakotaSame-day funding is only available in some statesEligible businesses must have at least $100K in annual revenueNot ideal for brand new businesses since eligible businesses must be active for at least one yearAlternatives to OnDeckIf you aren't sure if OnDeck is the right lender for you, here's how it stacks up against a few other small business lenders.OnDeck offers lines of credit and traditional term loans but Kiva, another lender, actually offers crowdfunded microloans. This means that instead of getting the money directly from Kiva, you'll receive small amounts of money from a large pool of lenders. You submit an application and raise some funds from friends and family first then you may be eligible to raise money from Kiva's larger network of lenders. Because of this, it may be a while before you receive funding so if you need cash in a pinch, OnDeck offers the better terms with same-day funding.Kiva's maximum loan amount is just $15,000 while OnDeck's maximum is $250,000 so if you need to borrow larger loan amounts, OnDeck is your better bet.On the plus side for Kiva, though, this lender doesn't charge interest on U.S. microloans since the organization is a nonprofit.KivaLearn MoreTypes of loansPeer-to-peer crowdfunded loanBetter Business Bureau ratingA+Loan amounts$1,000 to $15,000TermsUp to 36 monthsMinimum credit scoreNo credit score requirementMinimum requirementsYou must be 18, live in the U.S., use the loan for business purposes, not be in foreclosure, bankruptcy or have any liens.AvailabilityAvailable nationwide except for businesses registered in Nevada or North Dakota.Terms apply.ProsAbility to borrow with no interestLoans are geared toward borrowers who are unbanked and have trouble qualifying for financial productsAbility to market your product to 1.6 million lenders on KivaConsYou need to prove your creditworthiness by inviting friends and family to lend to youIt can take a while to receive your loan since investors need to raise moneyNo BBB ratingLearn MoreView MoreCredibly is another small business loan lender that offers term loans as high as $600K so if you need to borrow more than $250K then Credibly would be the better lender for you. OnDeck's minimum credit score is already pretty low at 625 but Credibly requires a credit score of at least 500, making it more appealing to those with lower credit.CrediblyLearn MoreTypes of loansLong-term loans, working capital loans, business line of credit and merchant cash advanceBetter Business Bureau ratingA+Loan amounts$5,000 to $600,000Terms3 to 24 monthsMinimum credit score500Minimum requirementsMust have been in business for at least six months and have an average monthly revenue of at least $15,000AvailabilityCredibly offers business loans in all 50 states and Washington, D.C.Terms apply.ProsApproval within four hoursLow minimum credit score Loan amounts of up to $600,000Funds deposited as soon as the same business dayConsiders overall business health for approvalConsRequires average monthly revenue of at least $15,000Learn MoreView MoreFAQsIs it hard to get a small business loan?It can be hard to get a small business loan if you don't meet minimum credit score, revenue or business activity requirements. It can also be tough if lenders don't offer loans for your industry, but one of the best ways you can figure out where you stand and what it'll take to get qualified is to try speaking with lenders one-on-one.What credit score do you need for a business loan?Each lender has their own minimum credit score requirement, but aiming for a credit score of at least 680 may help you qualify for loans from some lenders.Can I get a small business loan even if my credit is bad?Some small business loan lenders consider borrowers with low credit, though, you'll likely be subject to higher interest rates.Subscribe to the CNBC Select Newsletter!Money matters — so make the most of it.
