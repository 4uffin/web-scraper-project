Kathy Hochul.Updated Mon, Sep 8 2025Kelsey NeubauerReporterShareShare Article via FacebookShare Article via TwitterShare Article via LinkedInShare Article via EmailNew York State is set to issue checks to more than 8 million residents to offset the increased sales tax they've paid thanks to inflation.The one-time payments, billed as "inflation refund" checks, range from $150 to $400, depending on your filing status and your adjusted gross income for the 2023 tax year.To qualify, you must have filed a 2023 residential state tax return in New York, earned less than $150,000 (or $300,000 for married couples filing jointly), and not be claimed as a dependent on another taxpayer's return. Tax status in 2023 Refund (based on 2023 income) Single or married filing separately$200 per person for those who earned $75,000 or less OR $150 per person for those who earned $75,000 to $150,000Married filing jointly $400 per household for those who earned
$150,000 or less OR $300 per household for those who earned $150,000 to $300,000Head of household $200 per household for those who earned $75,000 or less OR $150 per household for those who earned $75,000 to $300,000Qualifying surviving spouse $400 per household for those who earned $150,000 or less OR $200 per household for those who earned $150,000 to $300,000You don't need to fill out any forms, though: The funds will be automatically mailed to the address associated with your most recently filed tax return.If you moved since filing your 2024 return (or you haven't filed yet), you can update your information on the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance website.What do you need money for? Get matched with the right financial product.According to the department, checks will be sent over several weeks, starting at the end of September.The mailings are not based on ZIP code or region, so "you may receive your check sooner or later than your neighbors," the agency said in a statement. "We cannot provide a specific delivery schedule and our contact center representatives will not have additional information on the status of your check."What money moves would we make with $400? We're glad you asked.Pay down high-interest debtsThe first thing to do with any extra money is to pay off high-interest debts, like credit card bills, which can quickly gobble up any windfall.If you have $2,000 on a card with a 20% interest rate, for example, but only make minimum monthly payments of $53.33, it would take you more than 15 years to pay it off — including nearly $725 in interest.If you put the $400 inflation refund check toward that balance, though, you'd shave off two years and over $200 in interest.Struggling to pay off debt?
