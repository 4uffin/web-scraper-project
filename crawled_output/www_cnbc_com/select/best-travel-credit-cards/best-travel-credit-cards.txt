What you can use travel rewards for and the amount of rewards you earn varies by card.The type of rewards you earn, the cost of keeping the card and the card benefits depend on the type of travel card. There are three main types of travel credit cards: airline cards, hotel cards and flexible travel rewards cards.Airline credit cardsCo-branded hotel airline credit cards earn frequent flyer miles with that specific airline loyalty program. For example, if you have a Delta card, you'll earn Delta SkyMiles and if you have a Southwest card, you'll earn Southwest Rapid Rewards points. These miles and points can be redeemed for flights with that airline and its partners. There may be other redemption options, such as rental cars or hotels, but you'll normally get the most value when you use your miles for flights.Airline cards can save you money in other ways. Depending on the card, you may receive perks such as free checked bags, priority boarding and priority check-in. Many airline cards also give you a path to earning elite status, and sometimes you can even earn elite status without flying. Most mid-tier airline cards have annual fees of $150 or less. However, there are premium airline cards that cost much more and offer luxury perks such as airport lounge access.Hotel credit cardsA hotel credit card is a good option to earn free nights and elite status with your preferred hotel chain. These cards earn hotel points with that hotel chain and you can use those points to book rooms at any hotel under that loyalty program's umbrella.Hotel cards often come with automatic elite status and may earn bonus elite night credit for spending or give you other opportunities to spend your way to top-tier status. Luxury hotel cards may even offer statement credits and free nights every year you keep the card.Flexible travel rewards credit cardsIf you like to keep your travel options open and aren't extremely loyal to one airline or hotel, then a travel credit card that earns flexible rewards makes sense. These cards run the gamut from no-annual-fee travel cards to premium credit cards with top-tier benefits.What makes this type of travel card so special is the redemption options you have. You're usually able to redeem the points or miles you earn for one cent per point for things such as statement credits, gift cards or travel. Although, depending on the rewards program these aren't always the optimal ways to use points, and some redemptions are far less valuable, such as using points to pay for Amazon purchases.In general, the best way to make the most of your flexible travel rewards is to transfer them to partner travel loyalty programs. Each flexible travel rewards program has different partners, and by utilizing the best deals that your card offers, you can multiply the value of your points by booking premium cabin award flights to international destinations.How to choose a travel credit cardThere are a variety of travel credit cards available, from general to airline- and hotel-specific, and all the choices can make it hard to settle on one. Here are some tips on how to choose the best credit card for your needs.Consider annual feesConsider whether you're willing to pay an annual fee. Some travel cards have steep annual fees of over $500, which can be worthwhile, but not for everyone. Do the math to see if an annual fee travel card is for you.Review your travel habitsAnother key factor to consider is the type of travel you do most. If you travel within the U.S., then it doesn't matter if a card charges foreign transaction fees. But if you're off to Mexico or Spain, then it's important to have a no-foreign-transaction-fee card.Choose the right rewards programRewards should also play a part in your decision. Do some research to determine which card offers a rewards program more geared toward your spending habits. If you usually dine out when you travel, consider the American Express Gold Card with 4X points on dining at restaurants on up to $50,000 in purchases per calendar year, then 1X points for the rest of the year.You can compare card benefits side-by-side to see if one card rates better. The Chase Sapphire Reserve, for example, offers complimentary lounge access, while the Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card offers cardholders a fee credit for Global Entry or TSA PreCheck.Before you sign up for a travel credit card, consider how you'll use it and how you can best optimize its rewards program, especially if you're paying a steep annual fee. It's also important to make sure you can pay off your balance on time and in full each month because many of these cards have high interest rates.How do travel credit card rewards programs work?Travel credit card rewards programs operate on a simple premise — make purchases with your card and earn rewards you can use for travel. How you can use these rewards and how many miles or points you earn depends on the card and rewards program.Most credit card rewards programs offer a range of rewards cards to suit different needs. You can even have more than one credit card part of the same travel rewards program. These cards generally fall into four broad categories: business credit cards, no-annual-fee credit cards, mid-tier credit cards and premium credit cards.Business travel credit cardsTravel credit cards for businesses are available to anyone with a qualifying business venture, such as a side hustle, independent contractor gig or full-time business. These cards offer higher returns where business owners are more likely to spend the most, including office supply stores, advertising and shipping. They may also feature benefits such as discounts or statement credits for business services. You'll also be able to streamline your bookkeeping and often can sync your card with popular tax software such as QuickBooks or FreshBooks.No-annual-fee travel credit cardsIf you're new to credit card travel rewards, a card with no annual fee is a great way to earn rewards. These cards have fewer benefits than travel cards with annual fees but can still provide value. There are even no-annual-fee travel cards that allow you to transfer points, such as the Wells Fargo Autograph® Card and Capital One VentureOne Rewards Credit Card. With a no-annual-fee card, you may be able to upgrade to a card with more benefits and keep the points you earned with the old card.Mid-tier travel credit cardsMid-tier travel credit cards are the most popular and usually have annual fees of $150 or less, such as the Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card and Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card. You'll typically have a mix of good reward rates, valuable welcome bonuses and solid ongoing benefits. At this level of card, you're more likely to receive travel and purchase protections.Premium travel credit cardsSeveral travel credit card rewards programs offer premium credit cards with annual fees north of $400. A premium card tends to be loaded with statement credits and luxury perks, such as airport lounge access. The travel insurance available with a premium card is usually more valuable and may reimburse up to a higher limit or have large coverage limits. You'll also usually earn more rewards for spending, although, for certain categories, lower-tier cards can sometimes be more lucrative.How to redeem travel rewardsThe options for using your travel rewards vary depending on the rewards. However, you're typically able to redeem points or miles for:Gift cardsStatement credits or other forms of cashbackDirectly for travel, such as hotels, rental cars, cruises and flightsTransfers to partner travel programs, including airline and hotel loyalty programsMerchandiseRedeeming your rewards is straightforward, you'll need to log in to your account and you can complete most redemptions from there. The big thing to understand when you're using your rewards is that what you redeem them for changes how much value you receive and the value of each redemption varies by program. You'll usually receive a maximum of one cent per point for gift cards and cash-back redemptions. Using points for merchandise or Amazon purchases typically yields the lowest value, which is frequently less than one cent per point.If the program offers transferrable points, this is often the best way to get the most bang for your buck, especially when you take advantage of airline partners. By transferring points to the right airline partner, you can book International business- and first-class flights. These flights can cost thousands of dollars and provide well over two cents per point in value.What are the best uses for travel cards?The best way to use your travel card is to utilize its benefits while understanding its cost. Take note of any annual fees, foreign transaction fees and the APR associated with your account. Also, consider the rewards you'll earn and other perks, such as annual statement credits.Once you're familiar with what your card offers, you can maximize the perks. That may include setting reminders to use the annual $300 travel credit provided by the Chase Sapphire Reserve or submitting a Global Entry application with the Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card to take advantage of the up to $120 credit. Other cards have credits that you can earn monthly or semi-annually and will require you to stay on top of them to maximize the perks.When redeeming the rewards you earn with travel cards, you'll normally have several options. Certain travel cards offer cash-back type redemptions, which may offer okay value. However, you'll typically get the most of your travel points and miles when you use them for travel.Even if you're not using points to book travel, paying for your travel with a travel credit card is also a good idea. You'll generally earn bonus rewards for travel purchases such as hotels and flights. On top of that, many travel cards also provide protections at no additional cost, such as trip delay reimbursement or rental car insurance.Other types of credit cards to considerTravel credit cards aren't for everyone. If you travel infrequently, you should consider alternative credit card options, such as cards with dining, grocery or gas rewards. Some cards provide up to 6% back in those categories, allowing foodies, meal-preppers and commuters to benefit.Beyond rewards, you might benefit from a card that offers a 0% APR period. Some cards offer no interest for a year or more on new purchases and balance transfers, such as the Citi Simplicity® Card. When used responsibly, these cards can help you get out of debt without high interest charges.Citi Simplicity® CardCNBC Select Rating 4.3 Learn More CNBC Select Rating 4.3 Learn More SpotlightReceive a 0% Intro APR for 21 months on balance transfers and for 12 months on purchases from date of account opening.Credit scoreGood to Excellent670–850Regular APR18.24% - 28.99% variableAnnual fee$0Welcome bonusNoneSee rates and fees.

Traditionally, the term points referred to flexible rewards that could be redeemed directly through a bank's portal or transferred to a partner airline or hotel loyalty program. Meanwhile, the term miles has been associated with rewards earned through an airline's frequent flyer program. However, nowadays, points and miles are used interchangeably as there are flexible credit card rewards called miles and more restrictive airline rewards referred to as points.How do I compare credit cards for travel?If you're having trouble narrowing down the best travel card for you, it can be helpful to compare credit cards. First list the benefits you're looking for and any deal breakers, such as an annual fee. Then consider cards that have those benefits.What travel credits are easier to redeem?Travel credits that aren't tied to a specific brand and that apply to a wide range of purchases are easier to redeem. A good example of this is the annual travel credit of up to $300 that you get with the Chase Sapphire Reserve® because it's automatically applied to eligible purchases with no enrollment required.Can you earn travel rewards for business travel?You can earn rewards for business travel. With business flights or hotel stays, the points you earn are normally deposited into your personal rewards account. However, if you use a business or corporate credit card, the business owner or account administrator usually has control over any rewards that are earned.Why trust CNBC Select?At CNBC Select, our mission is to provide our readers with high-quality service journalism and comprehensive consumer advice so they can make informed decisions with their money.

We also considered additional perks (e.g., ongoing travel or merchant statement credits), cardholder protections (e.g., purchase protection, $0 liability protection and travel insurance), the application process when available (e.g., is there a credit pull or required credit score) and how easy it is to redeem points (e.g., are rewards are tied to a specific brand; if transferable, to how many/which partners, can you redeem for straight cash back).  We also considered CNBC Select audience data when available, such as general demographics and engagement with our content and tools.  For the cards that offered a rewards program, we considered consumer spending data forecasts from location intelligence firm Esri to determine where U.S. consumers are spending the most money, like on dining and travel. We used this to help determine what bonus categories are most useful for consumers. Since the value of a point or mile varies based on what they can be redeemed for, we also considered things like transferability and the ability to redeem for cash-back. When choosing the best travel credit cards, we focused on cards with travel-centered rewards programs and benefits. This includes flexible travel programs that allow you to redeem for travel and transfer rewards to travel programs. We also paid special attention to cards with travel perks, such as travel insurance, elite status benefits or airport lounge access.Catch up on CNBC Select's in-depth coverage of credit cards, banking and money, and follow us on TikTok, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter to stay up to date.Read moreThe best travel rewards credit cards for beginnersIf you want a travel rewards card without an annual fee, check out these top optionsBest airline credit cardsBest hotel credit cardsFor rates and fees of the American Express® Gold Card, click here.For rates and fees of The Platinum Card® from American Express, click here.For Capital One products listed on this page, some of the above benefits may be provided by Visa® or Mastercard® and may vary by product.
