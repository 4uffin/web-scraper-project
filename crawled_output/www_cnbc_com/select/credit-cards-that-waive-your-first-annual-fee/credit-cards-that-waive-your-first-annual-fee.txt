Compare credit cards CNBC Select’s credit card marketplace.Are annual fee cards worth it?While premium credit cards with higher annual fees can generate a lot of value, it depends on whether the card fits your lifestyle.If you're newer to credit cards, it probably doesn't make the most sense to start by choosing one with an extremely high annual fee, unless you're very confident in your finances and ability to pay the card off each month. It's also important to determine if the benefits fit your current habits; if you don't travel much, you probably don't need a card that comes with a TSA PreCheck credit or other travel perks.It's also important to figure out how much effort you're willing to put into maximizing the value of your credit card. Many premium credit cards provide value through statement credits for specific brands and partners. If the process is hard to navigate or you don't typically make purchases that would qualify for the credit, that perk is inherently less valuable.Whenever you're considering a credit card with an annual fee, ensure you at least break even in value, and make back your annual fee.Pros and cons of cards that waive your first annual feeProsLower barrier to entry: Not paying the annual fee for the first year on a credit card can help save you around $100 or so, depending on the card.Hands-on experience: Using the card for up to a full year can help you better understand how the card fits into your life.More premium perks: Cards that charge annual fees typically offer stronger perks and rewards.ConsMany cards automatically re-up: Many cards will automatically charge you the second year's annual fee when the time comes, unless you specifically remember to cancel ahead of the charge.Often higher financial risk: More premium cards typically come with higher spending limits and penalty APRs, making it even more important to track your financesFAQsCan I get my annual credit card fee waived?Yes, it is possible to get a credit card's annual fee waived. Many active-duty military service members may have annual fees waived, and other situations may be determined by the bank directly.Who offers credit cards with no annual fee?Most of the major credit card issuers, like Chase, Amex and Bank of America, all offer credit cards that don't charge annual fees.Should I cancel a credit card if it has an annual fee?Often it depends; if you are unable to get enough value out of the card to cover the cost of the annual fee, then it probably makes sense to close it. If you're already getting your money's worth from the card, you might want to keep it around.Why trust CNBC Select?At CNBC Select, our mission is to provide our readers with high-quality service journalism and comprehensive consumer advice so they can make informed decisions with their money.

See our methodology for more information on how we choose the best credit cards that waive your first annual fee.Our methodologyTo determine which cards offer the best value for rebuilding credit CNBC Select analyzed over 250 major credit cards issued through FDIC-insured banks and NCUA-insured credit unions that are widely available in the U.S.  We compared each card on a range of features, including rewards (e.g., cash back, points and miles), annual fees, welcome bonuses, introductory and standard APR and balance transfer fees and foreign transaction fees. We also considered additional perks (e.g., ongoing travel or merchant statement credits), cardholder protections (e.g., purchase protection, $0 liability protection and travel insurance), the application process when available (e.g., is there a credit pull or required credit score) and how easy it is to redeem points (e.g., are rewards are tied to a specific brand; if transferable, to how many/which partners, can you redeem for straight cash back).  We also considered CNBC Select audience data when available, such as general demographics and engagement with our content and tools.  Subscribe to the CNBC Select Newsletter!Money matters — so make the most of it.
