Reverse mortgage giant Longbridge Financial is addressing this gap with a new home equity line of credit (HELOC) for homeowners 62 and older.Longbridge's HELOC for Seniors incorporates elements of both a traditional line of credit and a reverse mortgage. Borrowers can get approved in as little as 15 minutes for between $50,000 and $400,000 during the 10-year draw period. (There's a maximum of 25 draws and at least 80% of the line of credit must be taken at funding.)Longbridge Financial HELOC for SeniorsLoan typesHELOCMinimum credit score660Maximum loan-to-valueCombined LTV ratio of 75%HELOC draw amount$50,000 to $400,000HELOC draw period10 yearsRepayment periodInterest-only payments until the house is sold,or the borrower moves out, dies or fails to keep up with housing expenses.AvailabilityLongbridge Financial offers HELOCs for Seniors in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Massachusetts, New Jersey, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Utah and Washington. ProsMaximum loan amount of $400,000Can make interest-only payments as long as you live in the home. Seniors on fixed incomes may qualify.ConsNot available in all states$50,000 minimum is higher than many other lines of creditFull payment is due when the borrower sells, vacates or dies.View MoreRather than a typical 20-year repayment phase, however, the full principal isn't due until the borrower sells the house, stops using the property as their primary residence or passes away. That's provided they maintain the home and stay current on interest payments, property taxes, and homeowners' insurance.Additionally, the HELOC for Seniors has a fixed rate, unlike the variable rate associated with most HELOCs. Read on: The best lenders for home equity lines of creditAccording to Longbridge, applicants with sufficient equity and assets may qualify even if they rely on retirement savings, disability benefits or other fixed income sources.To qualify, you need a credit score of 660, a debt-to-income ratio of 50% or less, and a combined loan-to-value ratio of 75% or less. Additionally, you must have owned the property for at least 90 days prior to applying.As with a traditional reverse mortgage, also known as a home equity conversion mortgage (HECM), applicants must be at least 62 years old, a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident and use the home as their primary residence.Read on: Longbridge Financial reverse mortgage reviewEligible properties include single-family homes, townhomes, condos, duplexes and planned unit developments. Co-ops, manufactured homes, multi-family properties and houses on the market or with an existing reverse mortgage are not eligible.To launch this hybrid product, Longbridge partnered with fintech company Figure, one of the largest HELOC lenders in the U.S.The absence of a maturity date or balloon payment allows seniors to, "live more comfortably, not more cautiously," says Longbridge CEO Chris Mayer."Too many older Americans are unable to access their own home equity, not because of poor credit, but because traditional lending products weren't designed for life after 62," Mayer said in a statement. "We built HELOC For Seniors to offer a better way forward."Read on: The best lenders for reverse mortgagesThe HELOC For Seniors is available in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Massachusetts, New Jersey, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Utah and Washington. According to Longbridge, more states will be added soon.HELOC FAQsHow does a HELOC work?A traditional home equity line of credit is a type of second mortgage that allows you to use the equity you've built up in your property as collateral for a loan. Your lender will determine the maximum draw, which can be more than 85% of your home's value. You can continue using the line and make only interest payments during the draw period, which is typically 10 years. After that, you'll make monthly payments on both the principal and interest, usually for a 20-year period.How is Longbridge's HELOC for Seniors different?Instead of monthly payments during a 20-year repayment phase, payment is due in full when the borrower sells the home, ceases using it as their primary residence or passes away. While traditional HELOCs don't have age requirements, you must be at least 62 to be approved for Longbridge's HELOC for Seniors.How much can I borrow with a Longbridge HELOC?Borrowers can access a line of credit ranging from $50,000 to $400,000 during the 10-year draw period. There is a maximum of 25 draws, however.Catch up on CNBC Select's in-depth coverage of credit cards, banking and money, and follow us on TikTok, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter to stay up to date.Subscribe to the CNBC Select Newsletter!Money matters — so make the most of it.
