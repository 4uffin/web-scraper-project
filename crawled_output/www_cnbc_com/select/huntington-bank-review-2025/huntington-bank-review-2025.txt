Some just want a simple, no-fee checking account, while others look for perks, higher interest or ways to make their money work a little harder. If you're curious about how Huntington Bank fits into that mix, here's a closer look at its checking accounts, savings and CDs to help you decide what might suit you.What we'll coverHuntington Bank checking accountsHuntington Bank savings accountsOther products offeredHow Huntington Bank comparesCompare offers to find the right savings accountHuntington Bank checking accountsHuntington offers a range of checking accounts depending on your needs and capabilities.Huntington Bank Asterisk-Free CheckingHuntington's most basic checking account, the Asterisk-Free Checking®, has no monthly maintenance fees, minimum deposit or balance requirements. If you like to keep things simple without extra conditions, it covers the basics. With over 1,000 branches in 13 states, it may appeal to you if you like in-person banking and if you're located in those areas. There's a small fee for out-of-network ATMs, so it works best if you mostly use in-branch ATMs or don't rely on them often.Huntington Bank Asterisk-Free Checking®Learn MoreMonthly maintenance fee$0Minimum deposit to open$0Minimum balanceNoneFree ATM networkOver 1,600 ATM locationsATM fee reimbursement$3.50 for each non-Huntington ATM transactionOverdraft fee$15; Options to waiveMobile check depositYesTerms apply.ProsNo monthly feesNo minimum balance requirementNo minimum depositConsATM fees $15 overdraft feeLearn MoreView MoreHuntington Bank Perks CheckingHuntington's Perks Checking® is a step above the Asterisk-Free account and earns 0.02% APY. It has a $10 monthly fee, waived if you maintain $1,000 in total monthly deposits or $5,000 in total relationship balances. If you tend to use a non-Huntington ATM, it also lets you waive up to five of those fees per statement cycle.Huntington Bank Perks Checking®Learn MoreAlly Bank is a Member FDIC.APY0.02% APYMonthly maintenance fee$10; Unless you maintain $1,000 in total monthly deposits or $5,000 in total relationship balancesMinimum deposit to open$500 to earn cash bonusMinimum balanceNoneFree ATM networkOver 1,600 ATM locationsATM fee reimbursement$3.50 for each non-Huntington ATM transaction; Options to waiveOverdraft fee$15; Overdraft protection availableMobile check depositYesTerms apply.ProsEarns interestOffers cash bonusNo minimum balance requirementOption to waive the monthly feeOverdraft protection availableConsATM fees$15 overdraft fee$10 monthly feeLearn MoreView MoreHuntington Platinum Perks CheckingHuntington's Platinum Perks Checking® is the most premium account, offering a slightly higher 0.03% APY. If you like added benefits, it includes unlimited waivers for non-Huntington ATM fees. It requires a pretty high $25,000 in total relationship balances to waive the $25 monthly fee, but if that works for you, it can be a strong option.Huntington Platinum Perks Checking®APY0.03% APYMonthly maintenance fee$25; Unless you maintain $25,000 in total relationship balances.Minimum deposit to open$25,000 to earn cash bonusMinimum balanceNoneFree ATM networkOver 1,600 ATM locationsATM fee reimbursement$3.50 for each non-Huntington ATM transaction; Options to waiveOverdraft fee$15; Overdraft protection availableMobile check depositYesTerms apply.ProsEarns interestOffers cash bonusNo minimum balance requirementOption to waive the monthly feeOverdraft protection availableConsATM fees$15 overdraft fee$25 monthly feeView MoreHuntington Bank savings accountsHuntington Bank Relationship SavingsThe Relationship Savings offers different APYs depending on your balance and whether you also own a qualifying checking account. If you like earning a more competitive rate, balances between $5,000 and $2,000,000.99 can get higher interest. The account also has a $10 monthly fee, waived if you maintain an average balance of $2,500, have an eligible checking account or start with a minimum deposit of $100.Huntington Bank Relationship SavingsLearn MoreAnnual Percentage Yield (APY)From 0.01% to 3.29% APYMinimum balanceMinimum balance to earn interest is $0.01Monthly fee$10; Unless you maintain an average daily balance of $2,500 or own an eligible checking accountMaximum transactionsNoneExcessive transactions feeNoneOverdraft fee$15Offer checking account?YesOffer ATM card?YesTerms apply.ProsLow minimum balance $100 minimum depositOptions to waive the monthly feeOptions to waive overdraft feeOption to add a checking account with ATM accessCons$10 monthly feeHigher APYs offered elsewhere$15 overdraft feeLearn MoreView MoreHuntington Certificates of DepositHuntington Bank CDsHuntington Bank CDs offer a range of rates, with standard rates generally low and promotional rates higher for limited 5- or 9-month terms. If you like short-term options with higher rates, these promotions may work for you. All CDs require a minimum deposit of $1,000, and if you like larger investments, jumbo CDs offer the same promotional rates for 152- or 270-day terms with a $100,000 minimum balance.Huntington Bank CDsLearn MoreAnnual Percentage Yield (APY)From 0.50% to 4.08% APYTermsFrom one month to 6 yearsMinimum balance$1,000Monthly feeNoneEarly withdrawal penalty feeEarly withdrawal penalty applies.Terms apply.ProsAbove-average APYsRange of CD termsNo monthly feeJumbo CDs available Has physical branch locationsConsYou can't access your money before your CD term endsEarly withdrawal penalty fee on certain CDsNo physical branch locationsLearn MoreView MoreOther products offeredHuntington Bank also offers a variety of other products, including: Personal loansAuto loansHome loansCredit cardsHome insuranceLife insuranceVehicle insuranceBusiness checkingBusiness savingsBusiness loansBusiness credit cardBusiness insuranceCompare offers to find the best checking accountHow Huntington Bank compares If Huntington Bank's offerings don't quite fit your needs, there are other banks worth considering. For example, Axos Bank offers the Axos ONE® package, which combines checking and savings with competitive rates on both accounts to help maximize your earnings. If you like accounts without extra hoops, there are no monthly maintenance, account opening or overdraft fees, and no minimum deposit or balance requirements — aside from what's needed to earn the higher APY.Axos ONE® savings and checking bundleLearn MoreAxos Bank® is a Member FDIC.Annual Percentage Yield (APY)Axos ONE Checking: 0.00% APY base rate and 0.51% APY promotional rate; Axos ONE Savings: 1.00% APY base rate and 4.46% APY promotional rateMinimum balanceNone.

The 360 Checking account earns interest as well and comes with no fees, minimum balance, or deposit requirements.
