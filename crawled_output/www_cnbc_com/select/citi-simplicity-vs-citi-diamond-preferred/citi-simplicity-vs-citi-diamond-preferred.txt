Both cards charge no annual fee and give you 21 months to pay off your balance interest-free.Though the cards look similar on the surface, they have a few key differences. CNBC Select breaks down how these credit cards differ and who each card is best for.Citi® Diamond Preferred® CardCNBC Select Rating 4.3 Learn MoreOn Citi's site CNBC Select Rating 4.3 Learn MoreOn Citi's site SpotlightReceive a 0% Intro APR for 21 months on balance transfers and for 12 months on purchases.Credit scoreGood to Excellent670–850Regular APR16.99% - 27.74% variableAnnual fee$0Welcome bonusNoneSee rates and fees.

Read our Citi Simplicity® Card review.Information about the Citi Simplicity® Card has been collected independently by Select and has not been reviewed or provided by the issuer of the card prior to publication.Our expert takeThe Citi Simplicity® Card may not earn rewards, but it can still save you money due to its amazing intro-APR offers.Pros & consOne of the longest intro-APR offers for balance transfersNo annual feeNo rewardsNo welcome bonusMore detailsBalance transfer feeThere is an intro balance transfer fee of 3% of each transfer (minimum $5) completed within the first 4 months of account opening. After that, your fee will be 5% of each transfer (minimum $5).Foreign transaction fee3%Citi Simplicity vs. Citi Diamond PreferredAnnual feeWelcome bonus, rewards and benefitsIntroductory APR offerWhich should you get?FAQsAnnual feeThe Citi Simplicity and the Citi Diamond Preferred both have no annual fee. Winner: Tie.Welcome bonus, rewards and benefitsNeither the Citi Simplicity nor the Citi Diamond Preferred offer a welcome bonus, rewards or significant benefits apart from each card's intro APR offer. This is typical for balance transfer cards, as the main purpose of these cards is to help you pay off debt rather than reward you for spending. Winner: TieIntroductory APR offerThe Citi Simplicity and Citi Diamond Preferred each have two introductory APR offers, one for balance transfers and one for new purchases. Here's how they compare.Balance transfer offerThe Citi Simplicity offers 0% introductory APR on balance transfers for 21 months from account opening, then a variable APR of 18.24% to 28.99% applies. The Citi Diamond Preferred offers the same 21 months of 0% intro APR for balance transfers, then a variable APR of 17.24% to 27.99% applies. For both cards, balance transfers must be completed within four months from account opening to qualify for the introductory APR. Balance transfer feeThe Citi Simplicity's balance transfer fee is 3% of the transferred balance ($5 minimum) for balances transferred within the first four months of account opening and 5% of the transferred balance ($5 minimum) after that. The Citi Diamond Preferred charges a balance transfer fee of 5% of the transferred balance or $5, whichever is greater. You would save $100 on a $5,000 balance transfer by using the Citi Simplicity over the Citi Diamond Preferred, assuming you complete the balance transfer within the first four months. Winner: Citi SimplicityPurchase offerIn addition to the introductory balance transfer APR, both cards also offer 0% introductory APR on purchases for 12 months from account opening, then the standard variable APR applies. Winner: TieOngoing APR and other feesAfter the introductory APR expires, the regular variable APR for purchases and balance transfers is 18.24% to 28.99% for the Citi Simplicity and 17.24% to 27.99% for the Citi Diamond Preferred. The exact APR will be based on your creditworthiness.While your goal should be to pay off any transferred balances or new purchases before the introductory period ends, and not carry a balance on your card going forward, it's still worth considering each card's ongoing APR. If life gets in the way and you end up with a balance remaining at the end of the introductory period, the Citi Diamond Preferred's lower regular APR means you'll pay less interest than with the Citi Simplicity.Another notable difference between the two cards is that the Citi Simplicity charges no late fees and no penalty APR, while the Citi Diamond Preferred charges late fee of up to $41 and a penalty APR up to 29.99%. However, you can avoid penalty fees altogether by always paying your bill on time. Winner: Citi Diamond PreferredCompare other credit cardsGet closer to your next vacation with a Capital One cardOffers in this section are from affiliate partners and selected based on a combination of engagement, product relevance, compensation, and consistent availability.Capital One Venture Rewards Credit CardCredit scoreGood to Excellent670–850Welcome bonusEarn 75,000 milesLEARN MORETerms apply.Capital One VentureOne Rewards Credit CardWelcome bonusEarn a bonus of 20,000 miles once you spend $500 on purchases within 3 months from account opening, equal to $200 in travelAnnual fee$0LEARN MOREWhich card should you get?The Citi Simplicity and Citi Diamond Preferred are both excellent balance transfer cards, each offering a 21-month intro interest-free period on balance transfers and a 12-month interest-free period on purchases. However, the Citi Simplicity has a lower balance transfer fee, while the Citi Diamond Preferred has a lower ongoing APR.Which card is better for you depends on what you value more: a lower upfront cost or a better contingency plan. If you can pay off your entire balance before the introductory APR expires — meaning the regular APR likely won't matter — then the Citi Simplicity is the clear winner with its lower balance transfer fee. But if you end up carrying a balance after the introductory APR period, your savings from the Citi Diamond Preferred's lower interest rate could potentially outweigh the card's higher balance transfer fee, depending on how much you owe and how long it takes you to pay it all off.If you're only planning to use the 0% introductory APR for new purchases and not balance transfers, then the balance transfer fee won't apply and the Citi Diamond Preferred wins out slightly due to its lower ongoing APR. However, both cards are suboptimal compared to rewards cards like the Chase Freedom Flex® or the Wells Fargo Active Cash® Card, both of which offer equal or longer introductory APR periods on purchases and more rewards and benefits.Wells Fargo Active Cash® CardCNBC Select Rating 5.0 Learn MoreOn Wells Fargo's site CNBC Select Rating 5.0 Learn MoreOn Wells Fargo's site Credit scoreGood to Excellent670–850Regular APR18.99%, 23.99%, or 28.99% Variable APRAnnual fee$0Welcome bonusEarn a $200 cash rewards bonusSee rates and fees.

After that, either $5 or 5% of the amount of each transfer, whichever is greater.Foreign transaction fee3%FAQsWhat's a good intro-APR offer length?Most dedicated balance transfer cards offer 0% APR introductory periods ranging from 18 to 21 months for balance transfers. The Citi Simplicity and Citi Diamond Preferred, with their 21-month-long balance transfer offers, are among the best in this category.The typical introductory APR offer for new purchases is around 15 months. The 12-month introductory periods offered by the Citi Simplicity and Citi Diamond Preferred are fine, but not great, compared to the competition.Do the Citi Simplicity or Citi Diamond Preferred earn rewards?No, neither the Citi Simplicity nor the Citi Diamond Preferred has a rewards program. The main draw of these cards is their 0% introductory APR offers, which can help cardholders save money on interest while paying off debt. If you want to earn rewards and can accept a shorter interest-free period, consider a rewards card with an introductory APR offer like the Wells Fargo Active Cash.What credit score do you need to get the Citi Simplicity or Citi Diamond Preferred?It's recommended that you have a good to excellent credit score (670 to 850) if you want to qualify for either the Citi Simplicity or Citi Diamond Preferred.  Why trust CNBC Select?At CNBC Select, our mission is to provide our readers with high-quality service journalism and comprehensive consumer advice so they can make informed decisions with their money.
