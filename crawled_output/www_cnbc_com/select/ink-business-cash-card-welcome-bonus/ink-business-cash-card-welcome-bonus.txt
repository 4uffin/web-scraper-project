Visit americanexpress.com to learn more.If you want a credit card that makes running your business easier instead of bogging you down with benefits that are complicated to redeem, the Ink Business Cash® Credit Card (see rates and fees) is worth a closer look.It has no annual fee and is especially rewarding for common small business and side hustle expenses, with additional rewards on purchases such as gas, internet and office supplies.Now is a great time to apply, as the card has an increased welcome bonus: For a limited time, you can earn a $900 cash bonus after spending $6,000 on purchases in the first three months of account opening.Ink Business Cash® Credit CardCNBC Select Rating 5.0 Learn MoreOn Chase's site CNBC Select Rating 5.0 Learn MoreOn Chase's site Credit scoreGood to Excellent670–850Regular APR17.49% - 25.49% variableAnnual fee$0Welcome bonusEarn $900 See rates and fees.

While the spending requirement is the same to earn the full bonus, the previous deal was broken into tiers and allowed you additional time to meet the spending requirement.Keep that in mind when applying, as you'll want to ensure you'll be able to spend at least $2,000 a month on the card. Otherwise, you risk missing out on the bonus or overspending to try and meet the bonus, which you'll want to avoid.You earn the $900 cash bonus as Ultimate Rewards® Points. This is important to understand if you have other Chase credit cards that allow transfers to travel partners, such as the  (see ) or Ink Business Preferred Credit Card (see rates and fees). You can move points between Chase credit card accounts, which means the bonus and other rewards you earn with the Ink Business Cash can be converted to flexible travel rewards. Instead of redeeming for cash back or gift cards, you could transfer your points to an airline and book a luxury flight for a fraction of the cost of paying cash.Set aside money for future use in a savings account designed for businessOffers in this section are from affiliate partners and selected based on a combination of engagement, product relevance, compensation, and consistent availability.First Internet Bank Business Money Market SavingsAnnual Percentage Yield (APY)3.46% with a daily balance of $5,000,000 or below; 4.42% with a daily balance above $5,000,000Minimum deposit$100 to open accountLEARN MORELive Oak Business SavingsAnnual Percentage Yield (APY)3.15%Minimum depositNoneLEARN MOREHow to qualify for the Ink Business Cash welcome bonusTo earn the Chase Ink Business Cash Credit Card's welcome bonus, you need to get approved and spend $6,000 on purchases in the first three months after the account is opened.

But this could be a part-time endeavor, side hustle, freelance work or independent contractor gig.

Depending on your business structure, for example, you may be able to use your Social Security number as your business tax ID.You'll want a good to excellent credit score to increase your odds of approval.
