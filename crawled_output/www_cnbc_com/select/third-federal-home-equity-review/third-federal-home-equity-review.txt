It has a relatively small footprint, however,: operating in just 25 states and maintaining physical branches in only Florida and Ohio.Customer service is available Monday through Thursday from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 6 p.m., and Saturday from 8:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. There are no Sunday hours.While Third Federal has a website and mobile app, neither has much information on how to qualify for approval.How does Third Federal compare?Here's how Third Federal Savings and Loan stacks up against two major players in the home equity space.Third Federal vs. Rocket MortgageRocket Mortgage Home Equity Learn MoreLoan typesHome equity loansMinimum credit score680Maximum loan-to-value90%Loan limits$45,000 to $500,000Repayment period10 to 20 yearsAvailabilityAvailable in all 50 U.S. states and Washington, D.C.ProsHigher-than-average combined loan-to-value ratio at 90%High customer satisfaction reviewsExcellent online user experienceConsHigh minimum loan amountNo brick-and-mortar locationsOnly provides two term options: 10 years and 20 yearsLearn MoreView MoreFor versatility, Third Federal Savings and Loan outshines Rocket Mortgage, which only offers home equity loans. In addition to higher rates and fewer terms, Rocket also charges closing costs, which Third Federal does not.Rocket is far superior in terms of availability, though, with loans and some form of online closing available in all 50 states. Third Federal only services half the country and requires an in-person closing.Rocket also offers repayment terms of up to 30 years for home equity loans, compared to the 5- or 10-year terms offered by Third Federal.Third Federal vs. FigureFigureLearn MoreLoan typesHELOC, DSCR, cash-out refinance, crypto-backed loanMinimum credit score640Maximum loan-to-value95%HELOC draw amount$15,000 to $400,000HELOC draw period2 years or 5 yearsRepayment period5 years, 10 years, 15 years, 30 yearsAvailabilityFigure HELOCs are available in all states but Hawaii.ProsFunding as soon as 5 daysE-closing availableNo opening fees, prepayment fees or maintenance feesHigh LTV maximumConsNot available in all statesMaximum draw period is five yearsAvailable APRs range from 6.65% to 14.60%, which includes the payment of a higher origination fee in exchange for a reduced interest rate, which is not available to all applicants or in all states. The lowest APRs are only available to the most qualified applicants, depending on credit profile and the state where the property is located, and those who also select ten year loan terms; APRs will be higher for other applicants and those who select longer loan terms. Your actual rate will depend on many factors such as your credit, combined loan-to-value ratio, loan term, occupancy status, and whether you are eligible for and choose to pay a higher origination fee in exchange for a lower rate. Rates change frequently so your exact APR will depend on the date you apply. APRs for home equity lines of credit do not include costs other than interest. You will be responsible for an origination fee of up to 4.99% of your initial draw, depending on the state in which your property is located and your credit profile. You may also be responsible for paying the costs of valuation if an AVM is not available for your property ($180), or an appraisal if your loan amount exceeds $400,000 ($500-$2,000, depending on property type, property value, and state), manual notarization if your county doesn't permit eNotary ($350), and recording fees ($0 - $315) and recording taxes, which vary by state and county ($0-  $1,400 per one hundred thousand dollars borrowed). Property insurance is required as a condition of the loan and flood insurance may be required if your property is located in a flood zone.Learn MoreView MoreWhile Figure is available in more states, Third Federal offers more flexibility with its HELOC: Borrowers have a 10-year draw period and a 30-year repayment phase, whereas Figure requires borrowers to use the full line of credit in their initial withdrawal. The line only remains open for a maximum of five years.Additionally, Third Federal offers both home equity loans and lines of credit, while Figure only has HELOCs.Figure is an online-only lender, but it offers virtual perks that Third Federal does not, such as remote closing and a virtual appraisal process.How to apply with Third FederalYou can apply for a home equity loan or HELOC with Third Federal Savings and Loan online, over the phone or in person at one of 37 branches in Florida and Ohio.You'll need to provide personal information, including your photo ID, Social Security number, pay stubs, your most recent W-2s and (for self-employed borrowers) two years of personal tax returns.You'll also need to provide details about the property, including the deed and recent mortgage statements.

There are no closing costs, minimum draws or prepayment penalties.But its home equity products max out at $300,000, so if you need a larger loan — or live in one of the 25 states it doesn't operate in — you'll want to look for another lender.Third Federal Savings and Loan FAQsWhat credit score is required for a HELOC?Most lenders require a credit score of 650 to 680 to qualify for a HELOC or home equity loan.Is Third Federal Savings and Loan legit?Yes, Third Federal Savings and Loan has been a trusted financial institution since its founding in 1938.
