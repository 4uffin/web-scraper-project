You need a website to establish identity and credibility, to tell people exactly what you offer and how to contact you for services. The good news is that nowadays, you don't need to hire a professional and pay thousands to build a business website; platforms like Squarespace make the process easier for people who don't know how to code.Below, we review Squarespace as a website builder for small business owners. Read on to find out if Squarespace is right for you.SquarespaceLearn MoreInformation about Squarespace has been collected independently by Select and has not been reviewed or provided by the issuer of the card prior to publication.Cost$16/month for Basic plan; $23/month for Core plan; $39/month for Plus plan; $99/month for Advanced planFree trial available?14-day free trialStandout featuresSquarespace offers several features for building yourself a website, including a wide variety of templates to choose from, support from a Squarespace web designer, marketing tools, a logo maker and more.

You can build a functional website on your own thanks to Squarespace's template library and drag-and-drop interface.TemplatesSquarespace offers almost 200 templates that fit a variety of needs. The platform offers templates for online stores, portfolios, blogs, membership sites, landing pages, online courses and services and more.The templates are well-suited for over a dozen industries including art and design, nonprofits, events, fashion, sports, food, beauty, home decor, business, media, personal professional, photography, real estate and several others.Templates are included in your plan so you won't need to pay an extra fee to use them.AI designSquarespace offers their very own AI website builder called Blueprint AI. It designs you a custom website based on your brand personality, type of content you want and the pages and sections you want on your site.It'll ask you a few questions about your business, like what industry it belongs to. You can view previews of your site as you make selections so you can make sure you'll be happy with the finished product. According to Squarespace's website, you can get your site designed in just minutes but, of course, it can depend on how complex of a website you want.This service is included in your paid Squarespace plan.Marketing toolsSquarespace offers built-in tools to help you get the word out about your business. Here's what you can expect:Email campaignsIntegrations with Facebook and Instagram so you can make sales from your posts and storiesPromotional banners for sales, holidays and other eventsWebsite forms to capture data from site visitorsMonitor your marketing analyticsSquarespace pricingSet aside money for future use in a savings account designed for businessOffers in this section are from affiliate partners and selected based on a combination of engagement, product relevance, compensation, and consistent availability.First Internet Bank Business Money Market SavingsAnnual Percentage Yield (APY)3.46% with a daily balance of $5,000,000 or below; 4.42% with a daily balance above $5,000,000Minimum deposit$100 to open accountLEARN MORELive Oak Business SavingsAnnual Percentage Yield (APY)3.15%Minimum depositNoneLEARN MOREThe Basic plan at Squarespace costs $16 per month and gives you access to a free custom domain, Squarespace AI tools, website templates and lets you add up to two contributors. You can also sell products, services and memberships and send invoices for free with this plan. If you accept payments through the site, you'll be charged an online store transaction fee of 2% (with all other plans, the online store transaction fee is 0%). And if you sell a digital membership or digital content through your site, you'll be charged a 7% fee (the fee is 5% with the Core plan, 1% with the Plus plan and 0% with the Advanced plan).The Core plan costs $23 per month and gives you access to the other features with the Basic plan, but it also includes unlimited contributors, a professional email from Google workspace, website and sales funnel analytics, shipping and tax services and the ability to completely customize your website with your own CSS and Javascript.The Plus plan is $39 per month and includes everything in the Core plan but with lower transaction and membership sale fees. The Advanced is the same deal but costs $99 per month. These plans also differ in terms of the amount of video content hosting and storage they allow, which may be important if you're selling digital content through your site. The Core plan lets you host up to five hours of video content, Plus gives you up to 50 hours and Advanced lets you host and store an unlimited amount of video content.So, if you just need a basic website to display your services or act as a landing page for your business information, the Basic plan should give you everything you need at an affordable price point.But if your business will lean on the website more for e-commerce and selling online memberships and digital content, you'll want to choose amongst some of the higher priced plans and take the transaction fees into account.Squarespace customer reviews and ratingsSquarespace has an average rating of 4.3 out of 5 stars on Gartner. Users who are happy with the platform cite that the drag and drop features make it easy for beginners to build their own website. Others have remarked that the templates seem high-quality. Overall, reviewers believe that Squarespace is quite user-friendly enough for small enterprises but may not fit the scaling needs of larger organizations.On the flip side, reviewers have reported that customer service can sometimes take days to respond to an inquiry. Other reviewers have expressed wanting a completely free plan rather than just a 14-day free trial.On G2, Squarespace boasts an average rating of 4.5 out of 5 stars and almost 1,700 reviews. The lowest rated reviews agree that there's a lot that can be done on Squarespace for those with no knowledge of coding; however, if you want to implement more complex styles and designs, it's difficult and sometimes even buggy to do that. Reviewers also cite that customer service can take a while to respond and resolve your issues, which can be problematic when you're running a business and need solutions quickly.Reviewers that gave Squarespace higher ratings say that the platform is easy to use and easy to integrate with other apps.My personal takeAs someone who has used both simple and more complex website building platforms throughout my career, my question when choosing between these platforms is, "Can I get a website that looks the way I want it to at a price that's really affordable?" I've used Squarespace a few times in the past to build blogs and portfolios with my own custom domain. Squarespace's pricing is on the lower end in its market — most other competitors are priced a bit higher.All of Squarespace's templates have a modern touch and feel to them, yet I'd like to see more new templates added to their library, especially since some competitors on the market offer hundreds more templates. I also like how easy it is to incorporate features like a moving banner in the middle of my page to draw attention or prominent buttons to take visitors to other parts of the site. The templates can be customized by dragging and dropping the elements on the page to exactly where you want them. I've previously used website builders where I needed to install plug-ins to access certain buttons and looks and then embed code into the header, footer or other areas of the site where I wanted it to show up. So, drag-and-drop capabilities make the process way faster. I have built an entire functional websites on Squarespace with multiple pages in literally less than a day without having to code anything myself.Squarespace pros and consConsider these pros and cons if you're comparing website builders and looking to get started with Squarespace.ProsAffordable pricing plansOffers a 14-day free trialAlmost 200 customizable templatesDrag-and-drop features for customizing a websiteNo coding experience needed but some plans have the option to further customize templates with your own CSS and JavascriptConsNo completely free planReviewers say that customer service resolutions have a long turnaround timeAlternatives to SquarespaceWhile Squarespace does have features for businesses that are selling products online, Shopify has gained a reputation as an industry-leading platform for e-commerce businesses to build websites. The online credit card payment processing fees are pretty similar across platforms: Squarespace and Shopify both charge 2.5% + $0.30 per payment for the Advanced plan and both charge 2.9% + $0.30 per payment in the most basic plans. However, Shopify has a more robust suite of features aimed at e-commerce businesses, like multiple inventory locations, shipping and insurance discounts, in-person payment processing systems and more.Squarespace does offer a longer free trial period compared to Shopify; Squarespace offers a 14-day free trial and Shopify only offers a 3-day free trial.ShopifyLearn MoreCostPlans start at $29/month Free trial available?Yes, 3-day free trial; after, you'll have to select a planStandout featuresShopify offers several ways to customize your shop whether you're selling in-person or online, including tons of shop templates/themes, apps for managing your business and the ability to create customer discounts and offer gift cards.

Wix offers slightly higher priced plans that start at $17 per month for the Light plan, $29 per month for the Core plan, $39 per month for the Business plan and $159 per month for the Business Elite plan.
