This perk allows you to be reimbursed for expenses relating to the delay, like meals, clothing, toiletries and even lodging.Depending on the card, you'll need to be delayed by a minimum of six or twelve hours for the trip delay benefit to take effect. My favorite cards with trip delay protection are:Marriott Bonvoy BoldIf you're a Marriott loyalist, the Marriott Bonvoy Bold credit card is an excellent way to accumulate Bonvoy points. And it's one of the few cards without an annual fee that offers trip delay protection. You'll need to be delayed by at least 12 hours for the benefit to kick in, but once it does, it has a generous $500 reimbursement cap.Marriott Bonvoy Bold® Credit CardCNBC Select Rating 4.3 CNBC Select Rating 4.3 Credit scoreGood to Excellent670–850Regular APR20.49% - 27.49% variable on purchases and balance transfersAnnual fee$0Welcome bonusEarn 30,000 Bonus PointsInformation about the Marriott Bonvoy Bold® Credit Card has been collected independently by CNBC Select and has not been reviewed or provided by the issuer of the card prior to publication.Our expert takeThe Marriott Bonvoy Bold® Credit Card has basic benefits and no annual fee, which makes it ideal if you occasionally stay with Marriott and don't need premium perks.More detailsRewardsEarn up to 14X total points for every $1 spent at thousands of hotels participating in Marriott Bonvoy® with the Marriott Bonvoy Bold® Card.Earn 2X points for every $1 spent at grocery stores, rideshare, select food delivery, select streaming, and internet, cable, and phone services.Earn 1X point for every $1 spent on all other purchases.Balance transfer feeEither $5 or 5% of the amount of each transfer, whichever is greaterChase Sapphire PreferredChase Sapphire Preferred has the same reimbursement rate as Marriott Bonvoy Bold ($500 for a 12-hour delay), and tacks on a $95 annual fee (see rates and fees).

If that appeals to you, look into travel insurance: Some policies, including Travel Insured International's Worldwide Trip Protector plan and Allianz Travel's OneTrip Premier plan, cover delays starting at the three-hour mark.Travel insurance can offer another benefit your card can't: Simplicity.

Basic airline and travel cards require a delay of at least 12 hours before they'll compensate you. However, some premium travel cards only require a six-hour delay before coverage begins.What does credit card trip delay protection cover?Typically, cardholders are reimbursed for reasonable expenses relating to the delay, such as meals, lodging and toiletries. There is usually a daily or per-person maximum, typically ranging from $300 to $500.What does credit card travel protection not include?It's rare for credit cards to provide comprehensive coverage for medical care or evacuation. And while most travel insurance companies have policies that allow you to cancel for any reason or to be covered for pre-existing conditions, that benefit is typically not available through a credit card. How do I get reimbursed for expenses relating to a delay?Call your card servicer or visit its website for details on filing a claim. Hold onto any receipts and documentation from the airline and submit them as soon as possible to avoid missing the filing deadline.Catch up on CNBC Select's in-depth coverage of credit cards, banking and money, and follow us on TikTok, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter to stay up to date.Subscribe to the CNBC Select Newsletter!Money matters — so make the most of it.
