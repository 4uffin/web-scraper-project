Another 18% don't have enough coverage to pay another driver's bills after an accident.Combined, that's a third of all motorists nationwide. If you're hit by one of them, you could be on the hook for your medical expenses and vehicle repairs, even if you're not at fault.Nearly one in five accidents with injuries involved losses greater than the at-fault driver's coverage limits, according to the Insurance Research Council.That's why many auto insurance companies offer uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage (UM/UIM). It shields policyholders from at-fault drivers with insufficient liability insurance.Only some states require drivers to carry UM — and even fewer mandate both UM and UIM coverage — but enrolling in both could save you thousands of dollars.What is uninsured motorist coverage? Uninsured motorist (UM) coverage reimburses you if you're hit by a driver without car insurance. In some states, it also covers hit-and-run accidents.UM combines:Uninsured Motorist Property Damage Coverage (UMPD): Covers damages to your car. Some policies also cover damage to other property and pay for a rental car while your vehicle is being repaired.Uninsured Motorist Bodily Injury Coverage (UMBI): Pays for medical bills, pain and suffering, lost wages, funeral costs and other out-of-pocket expenses.What is underinsured motorist coverage? Underinsured motorist (UIM) coverage is similar to uninsured motorist coverage, but it pays out if you are hit by someone who doesn't have enough liability coverage to pay for all your medical expenses and car repair bills.There are two main types of coverage in this category:Underinsured Motorist Bodily Injury Coverage (UIMBI): Pays for medical bills, pain and suffering, lost wages, funeral costs and other out-of-pocket expenses.Underinsured Motorist Property Damage Coverage (UIMPD): Covers damages to your car. Some policies also pay for damage to other property and for a rental car while yours is being repairedIf you're hit by someone without liability insurance (or with too little), you would file a claim with your own insurance company, which would reimburse you up to the limits in your UM/UIM policies.There is no deductible; however, filing a claim may still affect your insurance premiums.What states require uninsured motorist insurance?Twenty-two states and Washington, D.C. require drivers to have uninsured motorist (UM) coverage. Many of them also require UIM insurance, although the specifics vary greatly. Check with our state's Department of Motor Vehicles or Department of Insurance to see if UM/UIM coverage is required and the exact amount.State UM requirements UIM requriements AlabamaNoneNoneAlaskaNoneNoneArizonaNoneNoneArkansasNoneNoneCaliforniaNoneNoneColoradoNoneNoneConnecticut$25,000$50,000DelawareNoneNoneFloridaNoneNoneGeorgiaNoneNoneHawaiiNoneNoneIdahoNoneNoneIllinois$25,000 per person, $50,000 per accidentNoneIndiana$25,000 per person, $50,000 per accident$50,000IowaNoneNoneKansas$25,000$50,000KentuckyNoneNoneLouisianaNoneNoneMaine$50,000$100,000Maryland$30,000 per person, $60,000 per accident, $15,000 property damageNoneMassachusetts$20,000 per person, $40,000 per accidentNoneMichiganNoneNoneMinnesota$25,000 per person, $50,000 per accidentNoneMississippiNoneNoneMissouri$25,000 per person, $50,000 per accidentNoneMontanaNoneNoneNebraska$25,000$50,000NevadaNoneNoneNew HampshireIf purchased, $25,000 per person, $50,000 per accidentNoneNew Jersey$25,000$50,000New MexicoNoneNoneNew York$25,000 per person, $50,000 per accidentNoneNorth Carolina$50,000 per person, $100,000 per accident$50,000North Dakota$25,000$50,000OhioNoneNoneOklahomaNoneNoneOregon$25,000$50,000PennsylvaniaNoneNoneRhode IslandIf higher than minimum liability coverage is purchased, at least $25,000 per person and $50,000 per accident

If your state requires it, it may already be included in your quote.Whether your state's minimum UM/UIM requirement is sufficient depends on your budget and the type of car you drive. If you own a 2026 Porsche 911, for example, Maryland's $15,000 minimum for UM property damage coverage is likely insufficient. If you drive a 2013 Toyota Corolla, though, it may be more than enough.If your state doesn't require UM/UIM, choose an amount that makes sense based on the value of your car and your financial situation. A good rule of thumb is to match your liability coverage limits.To see if you already have UM/UIM coverage, check your current auto insurance policy declarations page or log into your insurer's mobile app or website.Paying too much for car insurance?

Check your state's Department of Motor Vehicles or Department of Insurance website to see if UM/UIM coverage is required and the exact amount.Is UM/UIM coverage worth it?While UM and UIM coverage add to your monthly premiums, it's a lot less than what you'd have to pay after a serious accident where you were hit by someone who was uninsured or underinsured. Nearly 20% of collisions with injuries involved medical expenses that were beyond the at-fault driver's coverage limits.How much uninsured motorist coverage do I need?If you're in a state that requires it, you must choose an amount equal to or greater than the minimum requirement. If your state doesn't require UM/UIM, matching your liability coverage limits is a good rule of thumb.Subscribe to the CNBC Select Newsletter!Money matters — so make the most of it.
