As this generation started moving out and supporting themselves, over one-third (35%) reported spending more per month than they expected.If you're trying to find your financial footing, the right credit card can help offset the everyday expenses that are costing you more than you expected each month. Below, CNBC Select dives into these categories and the most rewarding credit cards for each one.Best credit cards for Gen ZGen Z monthly spendingSaving on groceriesEarning rewards from rent paymentsEnjoying dining outGen Z monthly spendingOf the Gen Z members who reported spending more per month than expected, these are the most common expenses that cost more than they thought they would: Groceries and toiletries (63%), rent/utilities (47%) and dining out (42%).With the cost of living increasing, Gen Z has been taking steps to cut down on their spending. Now 41% shop at more affordable grocery stores and 23% cut back on dining out. While cutting back on spending is a great way to save money, using the right credit card for your purchases can also help combat higher expenses.Certain credit cards earn up to 6% back where Gen Z spends more than expected. So you can earn more rewards on these expenses, which helps offset the cost.Saving on groceriesIn addition to shopping around to find the grocery store with the best prices, using a card that earns cash back on this everyday expense can help you save in the long run.
