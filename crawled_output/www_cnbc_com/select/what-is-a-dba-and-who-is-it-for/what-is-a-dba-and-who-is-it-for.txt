Depending on the type of business entity you're forming, you may be required to register a DBA.Below, CNBC Select walks you through everything you need to know about DBA's and whether it's right for you.What we'll coverWhat is a DBA?Who needs a DBA?How do you file a DBA?FAQsSet aside money for future use in a savings account designed for businessOffers in this section are from affiliate partners and selected based on a combination of engagement, product relevance, compensation, and consistent availability.First Internet Bank Business Money Market SavingsAnnual Percentage Yield (APY)3.46% with a daily balance of $5,000,000 or below; 4.42% with a daily balance above $5,000,000Minimum deposit$100 to open accountLEARN MORELive Oak Business SavingsAnnual Percentage Yield (APY)3.15%Minimum depositNoneLEARN MOREWhat is a DBA?DBA is an acronym that stands for "doing business as." It's used when the name of your business will be different from your name as the owner. However, certain entities where the business name will be different from your name are not required to register a DBA.Who needs a DBA?There are some business entities where a DBA is required if the owner wants to come up with a name for the business other than their own. But some states may also have requirements for DBA's, in which case you'll want to follow your state's guidance.Sole proprietorships: Sole proprietorships don't typically need to be officially registered since all the business income flows through the owner's personal income tax return. In this case, your "business name" would automatically be your own name. But if you'd prefer to have your business name as something else to establish a separate brand identity, then you'd need to register a DBA.Partnerships: A partnership is a type of business that has more than one owner and they all share the profits (and losses). However, unlike with a multi-member LLC, partnerships do not have limited liability protection from the debts and bankruptcies of the business. Similar to sole proprietorships, partnerships don't have that legal separation between the business and the owners so if the owners want to operate under a name that isn't theirs, they'll need to file a DBA.Franchises: Franchises may not always require a DBA but if you're someone who starts an LLC to own multiple franchises, it can be a good idea to file a DBA so that each franchise can operate under a name that's different from the LLC (like their widely-recognized, branded name). Some franchise agreements might actually require the owner to operate under the branded name, in which case there's no getting around filing a DBA even if you're only operating one franchise.Business owners in a state that requires a DBA: There are only 13 states that don't require businesses in their state to register a DBA. Those states are: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Kansas, Maryland, Mississippi, Nebraska, Ohio, Wisconsin and Wyoming. If you're running your business out of the other 37 states, you'll need to file a DBA.How do you file a DBA?Business formation platforms like ZenBusiness and LegalZoom offer services to help you file your DBA. Prices can vary but LegalZoom's prices start at $99 + state filing fee. ZenBusiness's pricing starts at $95 + state fees.ZenBusiness can only support DBA filings for 20 states including:ColoradoIdahoIllinoisIndianaIowaMaineMichiganMississippiMissouriMontanaNew HampshireNew JerseyNew YorkOhioOklahomaOregonRhode IslandSouth DakotaTexasUtahZenBusinessLearn MoreCost$0 + state filing fees for Starter plan; $199/year + state filing fees for Pro plan; $299/year + state fees for Premium planApp available?YesStandout featuresZenBusiness offers a wide selection of services that range from formation offerings to compliance, managing your finances and building a website and logo.

You'll want to start by performing a search to see if your desired name is available in your state or if it's already been taken. You can do this by going to the Secretary of State and using the business entity search tool, or you can go to sites like Northwest Registered Agent and Bizee, which also have business name checker tools.Then you'll go to your local county clerk's office or website to file your DBA. You'll also pay a filing fee, which can vary depending on your state. Some states charge a filing fee of up to $100 and an additional fee if you'd like copies of your certificate.If you need to change anything on your DBA or choose a new name, you may need to pay an amendment fee as well.FAQsWhat's the difference between a DBA and an LLC?An LLC is a type of business entity that separates your personal assets and liabilities from your business's. A DBA is not a legal entity. It's just the name you register your business as.What are the advantages of a DBA?A DBA can make it easier to open a business bank account, allow you to separate your business brand from your personal brand and help you stay compliant with your state's laws.What are the disadvantages of a DBA?A DBA doesn't offer any protection for the owner's personal assets and liabilities. Without any liability protection, your personal assets can be impacted by any lawsuits and financial judgments against your business.Subscribe to the CNBC Select Newsletter!Money matters — so make the most of it.
