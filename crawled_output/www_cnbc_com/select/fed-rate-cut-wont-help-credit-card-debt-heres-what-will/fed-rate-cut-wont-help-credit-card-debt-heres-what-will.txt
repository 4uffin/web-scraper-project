"I'd say, in the grand scheme of things, card users aren't going to benefit much, if at all [from the Fed's rate cut]."If you pay interest on your credit card because you carry a balance month to month, there are some better ways to lower your rate and get rid of that debt once and for all. Let's dive into it.Call your card issuer and ask for a rate reductionA more effective way to lower your credit card interest rate than waiting and hoping it will align with the Fed's benchmark moves? Call the customer service number on the back of your credit card and request a lower rate. Even if you carry a balance month to month, if you have been making at least minimum payments on time each month, you have a strong and consistent track record to show for.Improve your creditYour creditworthiness, aka your credit score, is the "primary driver" of how high or low your interest rate is, Ulzheimer says. The better your credit, the less your debt will cost you. Since your payment history — whether you pay on time or late — makes up 35% of your credit score, it's the most important factor.Experian Boost is a free tool that can instantly boost your credit score. It lets you add on-time payments of household bills like rent, utilities, cell phone and insurance to your Experian credit file.Experian Boost®Learn MoreCostFreeAverage credit score increase13 points, though results varyCredit report affectedExperian®Credit scoring model usedFICO® ScoreResults will vary.

Balance transfer periods can last anywhere from 15 to 24 months, giving you at least a year to two years to pay off your credit card balance.The U.S. Bank Shield™ Visa® Card offers an introductory no-interest period of two years, then 17.74% to 28.74%. To qualify, you'll need to transfer the balance in the first 60 days. The balance transfer on this card costs 5% of the balance, which is pretty standard. Transferring a credit card balance of $10,000, for example, would cost $500.To be sure your $10,000 balance is gone by the end of the two years (once the 0% intro APR period is up, interest kicks back in), split evenly you'd pay $417 per month for 24 months, with zero interest accrual.U.S. Bank Shield™ Visa® CardCNBC Select Rating 4.5 Learn MorePersonal and small business credit cards issued by U.S. Bank are currently not available on CNBC Select.
