So, it's essential to teach your children financial literacy at a young age, setting them up for success as they enter into the "real world."Here at CNBC Select and CNBC Make It, we spend all day, every day reporting on money: what to do with it, how to spend it and where to put it. But what money lessons, if any, are we taking home to inspire an audience much different — our kids?3 lessons we're teaching our kids about moneyMoney is a limited resource; spend it wiselyInvestLive within your meansChoose the best savings account1. Money is a limited resource; spend it wiselyOne of the most important lessons CNBC Make It Executive Editor Jenna Goudreau is teaching her five-year-old daughter is that money is a great tool, but not limitless, she tells CNBC Select."I take her to the store and let her spend her 'budget' of piggy bank money, so she can see firsthand that she has to make choices about what she can afford," Goudreau says, adding that toddlers will learn they can't get everything they want.As kids get older, parents can introduce prepaid family debit cards like FamZoo and Greenlight that can help teach kids money management and financial literacy from a young age. With these cards, you can preload cash and digitally track what your kids are spending money on. Parents can set up savings goals and assign chores for an allowance through the apps, too.FamZoo Prepaid CardLearn MoreOn FamZoo's siteCard opening fee$0 for first 4 cards, then $3 for each additional cardMonthly fee$5.99 (or as low as $2.50 if you prepay for 24 months in advance)Maximum balance$5,000Cash reload fee$4 to $6ATM withdrawal feeNone, but the ATM operator may charge a feeForeign transaction feeNoneRewardsN/AMobile check depositNoTerms apply.ProsGreat way for parents to teach kids about moneyParents can control kids' spending, set up automatic recurring transfers (i.e. allowance), lock and unlock cardsNo card opening fee for the first 4 cards (then $3 per card)No fee on purchases made outside the U.S.ConsUp to a $5.99 monthly fee$3 card opening fee after your first 4 cardsNo mobile check depositLearn MoreView MoreGreenlight Debit CardLearn MoreCost$5.99 per month for Core Plan, $9.98 per month for Max Plan, or $14.98 per month for Infinity PlanRewards1% cash backMinimum deposit/balanceNoneOverdraft feeNoneATM accessAny ATM with a Mastercard, Visa Interlink or Maestro name or logoParental controlsParents can block spending categories and moreTerms apply.ProsEarns cash backIdeal for all young ages No minimum deposit/balance requirementsNo overdraft feeConsMonthly fee appliesNo ATM fee refundLearn MoreView More2. InvestThe earlier you invest, the more time your money has to grow, so that's something to take advantage of on behalf of your kids while they're young, Loren Savini, former editorial director at CNBC Select says.Start by opening a 529 college savings account — a move that most of the journalists interviewed for this story made. These state-backed investment accounts allow you or your child to make tax-free withdrawals if the money is used on qualifying educational expenses, including college tuition, housing and books.CNBC Select Editor Elizabeth Gravier opened two 529 accounts (one for each of her sons) both before their first birthdays.States have their own 529 plan, but in many cases, you don't have to live in the state to contribute to the plan. For example, New York's 529 College Savings plan is open to any U.S. resident and contributors can put up to $520,000 into the account.New York's 529 College Savings ProgramLearn MoreInformation about New York's 529 College Savings Program has been collected independently by CNBC Select and has not been reviewed or provided by the issuer prior to publication.Minimum opening balanceNoneMaximum overall contribution$520,000Portfolio optionsOptions include age-based options and individual optionsUnderlying fundsInvestors can choose funds from Vanguard mutual fundsFees and expensesTotal asset-based expense ratio: 0.12%Terms apply.ProsAvailable to residents of any stateOffers low feesDiverse investment optionsTax benefits for residentsNo minimum contribution to startOffers gifting platform that allows gift-givers to save profile for recurring or future contributionsConsPerformance is lower than others on listLearn MoreView MoreWhen your kids are older, you may want to introduce them to different types of investing. Teens can open a brokerage account as young as 13 years old. The Fidelity Youth® Account is a great option, as there are no minimums or monthly fees. Once the parents open the account, the teen can learn how to invest firsthand by managing the account, along with their parents' oversight.Fidelity® Youth AccountLearn MoreOn Fidelity's siteMinimum deposit and balanceTeens aren't tied to any account minimums and there are no monthly feesFees$0 commissions for online U.S. stocks*BonusFor a limited time: When you (parent or guardian) initiate the opening of a new Youth Account and your teen (aged 13 to 17) downloads the Fidelity Mobile® App and activates the new account, your teen will receive a $50 deposit as a reward1Investment vehiclesBrokerage and trading: Fidelity® Youth AccountInvestment optionsStocks, ETFs and mutual fundsEducational resourcesTeens can access a financial curriculum made just for them to learn about saving, spending and investingTerms apply.ProsNo account minimums or monthly feesEducational investing resources customized for young teensRequires parental oversight: In order for a teenager to sign up, their parent or guardian must already have an existing Fidelity account.

Live within your meansCNBC Make It Senior Managing Producer Eric Clark says living within your means is one of the most underrated lessons of our time — and a value he's instilling in his 19-year-old daughter."Especially in today's social media–obsessed world, I think a lot of people see a lifestyle they admire online and will do whatever they can to mimic it in some way. Far too many are willing to go into debt just for likes," Clark tells us.Recent surveys indicate that members of Gen Z, in particular, face pressure to overspend due to social media: About 70% of Gen Z respondents in a recent Empower survey reported experiencing financial FOMO (fear of missing out) while scrolling through social media."I let my daughter know it's perfectly okay to say 'no' if something doesn't fit within her means or budget," Clark says.You can provide your teenage kids with guidance on how to spend by having them download a budgeting app like Rocket Money, which breaks down spending by category like dining and drinks, shopping, saving and entertainment, so your young adult can stay on track.Rocket MoneyLearn MoreCostThe basic plan is free.
