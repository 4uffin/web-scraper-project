You're looking at shelling out an average of $32,000 for a hometown wedding and an average of $41,000 for an international destination wedding, according to The Knot's 2025 data.However, some U.S. states may be a bit more cost-friendly when it comes to having a wedding. Read on to learn more about the average cost of a wedding in all 50 states and Washington D.C., according to The Knot.How to save on wedding costs no matter where you liveConsider off-peak datesSummer and Fall tend to be the most popular times of year for weddings, with November to April being considered "off-season" months. However, off-peak dates can vary depending on the region you're in and the venue you choose. Off-peak timing tends to land you lower rates.Also, consider the day of the week. The most expensive day of the week to have a wedding is typically Saturday. Weekdays are usually more affordable, with the obvious trade-off being that it may be harder for your guests to take off work to attend.Open up a high-yield savings accountOnce you decide on a budget for the big day, save up for all the expenses. A high-yield savings account can help you reach your funding goals quicker since it pays you more in interest than a regular savings account does.Granted, you may not earn hundreds of dollars in interest each month (unless you deposit a lot of money in the account) but every dollar counts.The Marcus by Goldman Sachs High-Yield Online Savings account is a solid option since it doesn't come with a monthly fee, excessive transaction fee or overdraft fee. There is also no minimum required balance and the account earns a strong APY.Marcus by Goldman Sachs High Yield Online SavingsLearn MoreGoldman Sachs Bank USA is a Member FDIC.Annual Percentage Yield (APY)3.65% APYMinimum balanceNoneMonthly feeNoneMaximum transactionsAt this time, there is no limit to the number of withdrawals or transfers you can make from your online savings accountExcessive transactions feeNoneOverdraft feeNoneOffer checking account?NoOffer ATM card?NoTerms apply.ProsStrong APYNo minimum balance or depositNo monthly feesNo limit on withdrawals or transfersEasy-to-use mobile banking appOffers no-fee personal loansConsHigher APYs offered elsewhereNo option to add a checking accountNo ATM accessLearn MoreView MoreBut if you can make a large upfront deposit, the CIT Bank Platinum Savings account may offer you more bang for your buck.
