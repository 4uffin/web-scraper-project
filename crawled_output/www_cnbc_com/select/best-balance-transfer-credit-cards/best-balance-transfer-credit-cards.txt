The best balance transfer cards offer limited-time no-interest periods for these transfers. This enables you to save on higher-interest debt for a set amount of time, typically anywhere from six months to 24 months.Completing a balance transfer is usually fairly easy. Sometimes you can even transfer a balance when you apply for the card. Regardless of when you complete a transfer, you will also normally pay a balance transfer fee of 3% to 5% of the amount you transfer.Another tradeoff is that the cards with the longest intro-APR periods tend not to be as rewarding as the top rewards credit cards. So if you want a card with an exceptionally long intro-APR, you probably won't earn as many rewards.How to use a balance transfer cardUsing your card's balance transfer offer is fairly straightforward. You can usually opt to transfer balances as part of your application or transfer balances once you have your card. However, there are a few things to remember before taking advantage of a balance transfer offer.Pay attention to feesMost balance transfer cards charge a balance transfer fee. The fee is usually 3% to 5% of the amount you transfer. For example, transferring $5,000 with a 3% fee will cost you $150. This fee is charged to the balance transfer card, rather than the original card.These fees can quickly add up and you should factor in this cost when determining if it makes sense to get a balance transfer card.Know the restrictionsThere are a few limitations to be aware of before you apply for a credit card with a balance transfer offer.The first thing to know is that you can't make transfers between cards from the same bank. For example, if you have a Chase credit card, you can't transfer debt to another Chase card. So you'll need to apply for a card from a different bank than the one you want to transfer debt from.Also, you may have a limited time to complete your transfers. If you wait too long to make a transfer, you may miss the 0% APR period or the intro balance transfer fee.You'll also want to be aware of any limits on the amount of debt you can transfer. Card issuers typically cap the amount you can transfer to a percentage of your credit limit or a specific dollar amount. Issuers may also factor the balance transfer fees into this limit.See if you qualify for the cardBalance transfer cards usually require good or excellent credit. Qualifying for a balance transfer card can be difficult if you have subpar credit.How to choose a balance transfer credit cardUsing a balance transfer credit card to consolidate and pay off credit card debt is a great strategy to save on interest charges. However, it also needs to be paired with an overall strategy for paying down your debt.As you consider what type of balance transfer card makes the most sense for you, you'll want to do the math to weigh the costs and benefits. Balance transfer cards can earn rewards or even offer upfront bonuses, but the cards with the best intro-APR periods, typically don't offer rewards. However, the money you save on interest can easily offset any rewards you miss.Calculate how much you'll saveThe bigger the balance you want to transfer and the longer the zero-interest period, the more you save. Looking at what you'll save is not always as simple as looking at your current credit card balance and interest rate.One caveat to consider is how much of your balance you may be able to transfer to a 0%-APR card. If you have a large amount of credit card debt, an intro-APR offer can be quite valuable. However, the benefit is limited by your balance transfer card's credit limit and any transfer limits imposed by the card issuer.Know all the costsUsing a balance transfer offer can save you money, but it's not free, so you need to be sure the benefits outweigh the costs.Most top balance transfer cards have no annual fee, but it's something you want to look at before applying. Assuming the card you're applying for doesn't have an annual fee, you want to pay attention to the card's balance transfer fee. These fees generally run 3% to 5% of the amount you transfer and can easily add up to hundreds of dollars when transferring a significant balance.Pros and cons of a balance transfer cardPros of a balance transfer cardPay off debt: A balance transfer card can help you pay off your credit card balance more quickly because you won't pay interest during the intro-APR period.Build credit: A balance transfer card may help you improve your credit score by reducing your debt and lowering your credit utilization ratio.Cons of a balance transfer cardFees: The majority of balance transfer credit cards have a balance transfer fee of 3% to 5%, which eats into your savings.Tougher approval odds: You typically need a higher credit score to qualify for a balance transfer card.Alternatives to balance transfer credit cardsAs valuable as balance transfer credit card offers can be, it's not an option for everyone. You generally need a high credit score to have the best chance of being approved for these cards. Depending on your debt, you may only be able to transfer a portion of it.If you aren't eligible for a balance transfer card or opening a credit card isn't the right option for you, here are two alternatives to consider.Debt consolidation loanA debt consolidation loan is an unsecured personal loan you take out to pay off your existing debts and roll separate payments into a single loan. Depending on your credit score, you may be able to secure a lower interest rate. You could also opt for a loan with a longer repayment term, reducing your monthly payment and adding flexibility to your budget. However, if you take out a longer loan, you can end up paying more interest over the long haul because you'll spend less toward the principal each month.These types of loans can make sense if your credit score has been improving and you can qualify for a better rate.Borrow against your home equityIf you own a home worth more than you owe, you may be able to borrow against your home at a lower interest rate than credit cards and unsecured personal loans. If you're in this situation, several different financial products are available, including home equity loans, home equity lines of credit (HELOC) and cash-out refinance mortgages.Home equity loans and HELOCs are both types of second mortgages. That means you keep your original loan and take out an additional loan backed by your home. This option makes most sense if your current mortgage rate is lower than the rate you would qualify for if you took out a mortgage today.With a cash-out refinance, you are replacing your existing mortgage with a new, larger loan. If today's mortgage rates are lower than your current rate, you'll be able to lock in a better rate and get cash back. With a cash-out refi, you can typically borrow up to 80% of your home's value and there are upfront closing costs that can range from 2% to 6% of the loan amount.This is a unique strategy that isn't for everyone, and you have to remember that you are borrowing against your home. If you're unable to make on-time payments, your lender could force you into foreclosure.Compare personal loansFAQsWhat is the difference between a money transfer and a balance transfer?Money transfers and balance transfers are not the same. A money transfer is when you move funds from one account to another, at the same bank or between accounts at different financial institutions. A balance transfer is when you move debt from one credit card to another.Do banks do balance transfers?Banks only allow balance transfers between credit card accounts. And banks will not allow you to transfer balances between two cards issued by the same bank. If you want to do a balance transfer, you'll need to open a new credit card with a different card issuer.Do balance transfers always work?Whether a balance transfer works out depends on your goal. If you want to pay less interest and pay off your debt faster, that will need to be your focus during the promotional APR period. But if you continue to grow your credit card balance, the balance transfer may not have helped your situation as much as it could have.Do balance transfers hurt your credit?Applying for a new credit card will typically 'ding' your credit score (although the drop is usually small and temporary), but the balance transfer itself doesn't hurt your credit. However, if the balance transfer card has a low credit limit and you transfer over a high amount of debt, your credit utilization ratio will increase, which could hurt your credit score. You typically want to keep your credit utilization ratio under 30%.Is it worth getting a balance transfer?Balance transfers are good options for consolidating credit card debt. However, be sure to calculate the cost of transferring the balance versus the interest fees you'll accrue by simply paying down the balance on your current credit card.How do you qualify for a balance transfer?Balance transfer credit cards are typically for consumers with good to excellent credit scores. If you're approved for a balance transfer offer, you'll want to take advantage of it quickly as they are limited-time offers.Can you transfer a balance multiple times?Yes, you can typically transfer a balance more than once, but this strategy is often not recommended. You're not paying down your debt, and it will continue to grow larger, eating into your available credit and costing you in interest payments.Why trust CNBC Select?At CNBC Select, our mission is to provide our readers with high-quality service journalism and comprehensive consumer advice so they can make informed decisions with their money.

We also considered additional perks (e.g., ongoing travel or merchant statement credits), cardholder protections (e.g., purchase protection, $0 liability protection and travel insurance), the application process when available (e.g., is there a credit pull or required credit score) and how easy it is to redeem points (e.g., are rewards are tied to a specific brand; if transferable, to how many/which partners, can you redeem for straight cash back).  We also considered CNBC Select audience data when available, such as general demographics and engagement with our content and tools.For the cards that offered a rewards program, we considered consumer spending data forecasts from location intelligence firm Esri to determine where U.S. consumers are spending the most money, like on dining and travel. We used this to help determine what bonus categories are most useful for consumers. Since the value of a point or mile varies based on what they can be redeemed for, we also considered things like transferability and the ability to redeem for cash-back. When choosing the best 0%-intro-APR balance transfer credit cards, we focused on cards that offer longer intro-APR periods. We also placed a special emphasis on balance transfer fees and whether the cards offered intro APRs for purchases, balance transfers or both. Catch up on CNBC Select's in-depth coverage of credit cards, banking and money, and follow us on TikTok, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter to stay up to date.Read morePay off your credit card debt with no interest for up to 20 monthsHow to get the most out of your balance transfer credit cardWhat happens if you're denied for a balance transfer cardFor rates and fees of the Blue Cash Everyday® Card from American Express, click here.Editorial Note: Opinions, analyses, reviews or recommendations expressed in this article are those of the Select editorial staff’s alone, and have not been reviewed, approved or otherwise endorsed by any third party.Learn MoreTerms ApplyPaid PlacementEmpowerGet free tools and guidance to see how your investments are doing.Learn MoreTerms ApplyPaid PlacementQuickbooksWith Quickbooks, you can track your business expenses as they happen, as well as your income.LatestThe best 0% APR credit cardsJason Stauffer4 smart money moves now that the Fed has cut rates
