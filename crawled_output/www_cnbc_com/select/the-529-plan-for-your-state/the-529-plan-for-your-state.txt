Withdrawals are tax-free as well as long as they're used to pay for pre-school, high school or college. These educational savings plans are offered by your state and almost every state has one.What we'll coverThe two types of 529 plansThe benefits of a 529 planOther ways to save for collegeFAQsThe two types of 529 plansThere are two types of 529 plans: a college savings plan and a prepaid plan.The college savings plan is the most common type of 529 and it involves investing your post-tax dollars into the account.The prepaid plan involves "pre-paying" your child's future tuition at today's rates. You can make payments in three ways: a lump sum upfront, a five-year payment plan or fixed monthly payments. However, unlike contributions in a college savings 529 plan, contributions to a prepaid plan are not invested. Instead, the state government "guarantees" that the money you contribute will be able to pay for tuition at the current rate when the beneficiary is ready to use the funds.Prepaid plans can usually only be used to pay for public institutions but it can depend on the state.Here are the types of 529 plans offered by each state.529 plans by stateStatePlan Name (Direct Sold)Minimum ContributionMaximum Initial ContributionAlabamaCollegeCounts 529 Fund$0$475,000AlaskaAlaska 529 $25$550,000 T.

At least in some states. This means that money you contribute to a 529 account may be deducted on your taxes. Deductions can help lower your taxable income so this is one way to save a bit of money. Contributions to regular taxable brokerage accounts are not tax-deductible.Your money grows tax-deferred and withdrawals can be tax-free. Tax-deferred growth means you aren't paying annual capital gains taxes on your investments. And withdrawals from a 529 account are tax-free if you use them for qualified educational expenses. Otherwise, you pay a 10% penalty for using withdrawals for unqualified expenses.If your child doesn't use the money, another family member can. When you set up a 529 account, the child who will be using the money will become the beneficiary of the account. You can change the beneficiary to another eligible child or family member penalty-free.Other ways to save for collegeIt isn't always easy to pay for your kid's college but the sooner you start saving, the better. If your state doesn't offer a 529 plan and the plans from other states don't meet your needs, consider saving in other ways.You can open a traditional brokerage account and invest money in mutual funds, stocks and ETFs. However, states don't offer tax deductions for contributions made to taxable brokerage accounts. Fidelity and Charles Schwab are two of the more well-known institutions offering taxable brokerage accounts, among other types of investment accounts. They offer a variety of investment options as well as options for using a robo-advisor feature.Fidelity InvestmentsLearn MoreMinimum deposit and balanceMinimum deposit and balance requirements may vary depending on the investment vehicle selected.
