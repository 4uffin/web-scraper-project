While both cards offer more than the annual cost in value, you're committing a large amount of money. So it's important to make use of the card's perks to get your money's worth. We'll discuss more about how to do this below.Winner: Chase Sapphire Reserve for BusinessWelcome bonusNew Chase Sapphire Reserve for Business cardholders can earn 200,000 points after spending $30,000 on purchases in the first six months of account opening. With the Amex Business Platinum card, you can earn a bonus as high as 200,000 Membership Rewards® points after spending $20,000 on eligible purchases within the first three months of card membership.Both of these cards earn valuable transferable rewards, and both cards offer the same size bonus. The difference comes down to how much you need to spend to qualify for the bonus.Winner: Tie. The Chase Sapphire Reserve for Business has a smaller average monthly spending requirement ($5,000) because you have six months to earn the bonus. However, the Amex Business Platinum has a smaller total spending requirement. Even though you have a shorter timeframe to earn the bonus, it may be easier to earn if you have a big one-time business expense.RewardsWhile both of these cards earn the highest rate of rewards through their respective travel portals, they still offer a generous return in other categories.The Chase Sapphire Reserve for Business earns rewards at the following rates:8X points on Chase Travel℠ purchases5X points on Lyft rides through Sep. 30, 20274X points on flights and hotels booked directly3X points on social media and search engine advertising1X points on all other purchasesThe Sapphire Reserve for Business could be a good fit for business owners who frequently travel, as it offers up to 4X for flights and hotels booked directly, and up to 8X if using Chase's travel portal.

That makes this card valuable for businesses that frequently make larger purchases of $5,000+.Winner: The Chase Sapphire Reserve for Business. It has a higher return in its bonus categories with uncapped rewards.Redemption optionsBoth the Chase Sapphire Reserve for Business and the Amex Business Platinum offer a number of ways to redeem the points you earn, from cash back to paying with points at eligible shops.
