It had been the company's latest move in a "strategic transformation" announced in May 2024 to reenergize the brand.The restaurants were also scheduled to undergo remodeling to align with the new vision.But the rebrand came under intense scrutiny. Users on social media called it "soulless" and "generic," and conservatives took to social media site X to argue that the logo change was an attempt to remove the American identity of the brand to cater to diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. The stock sank in the wake of the changes.Cracker Barrel's old and new logo.Courtesy: Cracker BarrelCracker Barrel responded to the criticism, saying the company could have "done a better job sharing who we are and who we'll always be." The chain said the man from the original logo, Uncle Herschel, would still be featured on the menu and part of the Cracker Barrel "family."President Donald Trump even weighed in on the situation, saying Cracker Barrel "should go back to the old logo, admit a mistake based on customer response (the ultimate Poll) and manage the company better than ever before."The same day, the company announced a stunning reversal, shutting down the rebrand and retaining its original branding."We thank our guests for sharing your voices and love for Cracker Barrel. We said we would listen, and we have. Our new logo is going away and our 'Old Timer' will remain," the company said in a statement.Masino said on the Wednesday call that four locations with the modern designs are already being reverted to the traditional "Old Timer" signage."That's why our team pivoted quickly to switch back to our 'Old Timer' logo and has already begun executing new marketing, advertising and social media initiatives leaning into Uncle Herschel and the nostalgia around the brand with more to come," Masino said on the Wednesday call.She added that the company is launching "Front Porch Feedback" on Thursday to build on what Cracker Barrel has received over recent weeks. The new tool will allow reward members to comment directly to team members after every visit, Masino said.The company also announced it was suspending all of its restaurant remodels.Shares of the company rose after the reversal, mostly restoring its losses. Since its first announcement, Cracker Barrel lost and regained almost $100 million in market value."Cracker Barrel is not just an old country store or a restaurant," Masino said. "It's the front porch of America, and we take that very seriously."Correction: This story has been updated to reflect that the earnings per share are adjusted.Don’t miss these insights from CNBC PROTrump's $100,000 visa plan could hit these companies the hardestGoldman Sachs raises S&P 500 target for year-endChina isn't begging for Nvidia anymore.
