Here's whyPublished Wed, Sep 17 20251:25 PM EDTUpdated Wed, Sep 17 20252:31 PM EDTSarah Min@_sarahminWATCH LIVEWall Street will pay more attention to Federal Reserve independence at the conclusion of Wednesday's policy meeting, as President Donald Trump appointee Stephen Miran is expected to issue his first forecast in the so-called dot plot. The meeting could be historic on many levels. Not only is it likely to be the first meeting since December that the Fed lowers interest rates, but it could also show investors just how much influence the Trump administration is starting to wield over the central bank. "We're actually going to be able to quantify the degree of Fed independence," said Peter Corey, chief market strategist at Pave Finance. Miran is expected to cast his outlook on the Fed's dot plot, which charts where the central bank's policymakers expect the federal funds rate will be over the coming years. In June, the dot plot indicated three quarter-point cuts through the end of 2026. That's two this year, and one in the next. There's no way of knowing which dot corresponds to which Fed official given that they are anonymous. Yet, investors should be able to make an educated guess based on public comments from each of the policymakers. Miran, Trump's pick for the Fed whose appointment was fast-tracked by the U.S. Senate on Monday, is widely expected to pull away from the consensus, with more sizable rate cuts going forward. Other dissents are likely to come from governor Christopher Waller, who's being considered as a potential successor to Fed Chair Jerome Powell, and Michelle Bowman, another governor. In July, both Trump appointees had broken away from the central bank's decision to keep rates steady, the first time since late 1993 that multiple governors cast no votes on a rate decision. "We have Miran, and you have Bowman and Waller, and then you have everybody else," Corey said. "And if we start seeing the first two layers at this meeting move together — we're not going to see a big move yet from the rest of the group — but over time, I'm going to watch the migration from the Fed dot plot, in terms of the fed funds forecast, toward" the Trump administration's desired levels. "We'll be able to see exactly how independent the Fed actually is going to be in terms of its decision making," Corey added. "It's going to be fascinating, actually." Stocks could rally Wednesday as a more dovish dot plot could drive investors into the megacaps and other interest-rate-sensitive parts of the market. Still, if the three policymakers start to move as one block, then Pave Finance's Corey worries that the perceived erosion of the Fed's independence could have long-term implications for U.S. assets. The U.S. Treasury market, for example, could see foreign investor demand crumble. The U.S. dollar will weaken. Gold could rise on elevated inflation expectations. That could also hurt the U.S. stock market, even if the effects are not immediately felt. — CNBC's Jeff Cox contributed to this report.More In PlaybooksSantoli's Friday market wrap-up: Upward drift in tech heavyweights keeps big-cap indexes churning to new records Michael SantoliThe Fed may reignite a market bubble.
