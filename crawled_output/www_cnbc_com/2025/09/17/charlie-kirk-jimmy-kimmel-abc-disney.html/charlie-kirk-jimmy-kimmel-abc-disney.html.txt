David Ryder | ReutersCarr, whom Trump had nominated as FCC chair, told right-wing commentator Benny Johnson earlier Wednesday that Kimmel's comments were "truly sick," and said there was a "strong case" for action against ABC and Disney."This is a very, very serious issue right now for Disney. We can do this the easy way or the hard way," Carr told Johnson. "These companies can find ways to take action on Kimmel, or there is going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.""They have a license granted by us at the FCC, and that comes with it an obligation to operate in the public interest," Carr said.The FCC in March told Disney and ABC that it was launching an investigation of the companies' efforts to promote diversity, equity and inclusion, known as DEI.FCC Chairman Brendan Carr testifies before the House Appropriations

Congratulations to ABC for finally having the courage to do what had to be done," Trump wrote in a Truth Social post."Kimmel has ZERO talent, and worse ratings than even [Stephen] Colbert, if that's possible. That leaves Jimmy and Seth, two total losers, on Fake News NBC. Their ratings are also horrible. Do it NBC!!!" Trump wrote.The White House's rapid response account on X said that ABC was "doing their viewers a favor.""Jimmy is a sick freak!" the account tweeted.Anna Gomez, an FCC commissioner nominated by President Joe Biden, after Carr's comments to Johnson tweeted: "An inexcusable act of political violence by one disturbed individual must never be exploited as justification for broader censorship and control.""This Administration is increasingly using the weight of government power to suppress lawful expression," Gomez wrote.After ABC pulled Kimmel's show, Gomez wrote on X, "Free expression is non-negotiable. It marks the line between freedom and oppression. We must defend it without compromise."Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump says Murdochs are potential TikTok deal partnersThe U.S. states with the most — and least — H-1B visa applications and renewalsTrump aide denies Kimmel suspended because of WH pressure despite Carr threatBig Tech firms scramble after Trump slaps $100,000 fee on H-1B visasFormer Disney CEO Eisner backs Jimmy Kimmel, blasts FCC 'intimidation' of ABCTed Cruz compares FCC Chair Carr to Mafia boss in Jimmy Kimmel warningsTrump says 'I'm winning' after judge tosses his $15 billion NY Times lawsuitTrump, Xi make progress on TikTok deal, but more work remains, White House says'Tonight, we are all Jimmy Kimmel,' Colbert says, calling Trump an 'autocrat'Trump floats pulling licenses if networks are 'against' him after Kimmel suspendedTrump hints at 'good news' coming on the Russia-Ukraine warTrump admin asks Supreme Court to allow firing of Fed Governor Lisa CookFCC Chair Carr says 'we're not done yet' after Jimmy Kimmel suspension by ABCSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer condemned ABC's move."America is meant to be a bastion of free speech," Schumer, D-N.Y., wrote in a tweet."Everybody across the political spectrum should be speaking out to stop what's happening to Jimmy Kimmel. This is about protecting democracy," the senator wrote.The unions that represent writers and musicians who work on Kimmel's show criticized ABC and the FCC."This is not complicated: Trump's FCC identified speech it did not like and threatened ABC with extreme reprisals," said Tino Gagliardi, president of the American Federation of Musicians of the United States and Canada, in a statement."This is state censorship. It's now happening in the United States of America, not some far-off country. It's happening right here and right now," Gagliardi said.The Writers Guild of America West and Writers Guild of America East, in a statement, said, "The right to speak our minds and to disagree with each other – to disturb, even – is at the very heart of what it means to be a free people.""It is not to be denied. Not by violence, not by the abuse of governmental power, nor by acts of corporate cowardice," the guilds said. People gather outside the El Capitan Entertainment Centre where the "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" show is performed in Hollywood on Sept. 18, 2025 in Los Angeles, California.Mario Tama | Getty ImagesAri Cohn, lead counsel for tech policy at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, in a statement said, "The government pressured ABC — and ABC caved.""The timing of ABC's decision, on the heels of the FCC chairman's pledge to the network to 'do this the easy way or the hard way,' tells the whole story," Cohn said. "We cannot be a country where late night talk show hosts serve at the pleasure of the president. But until institutions grow a backbone and learn to resist government pressure, that is the country we are."Nexstar, in its statement saying it would not carry "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" indefinitely, said that the company "strongly objects to recent comments made by Mr. Kimmel concerning the killing of Charlie Kirk and will replace the show with other programming in its ABC-affiliated markets."Andrew Alford, the president of Nexstar's broadcasting division, said, "Mr. Kimmel's comments about the death of Mr. Kirk are offensive and insensitive at a critical time in our national political discourse, and we do not believe they reflect the spectrum of opinions, views, or values of the local communities in which we are located.""Continuing to give Mr. Kimmel a broadcast platform in the communities we serve is simply not in the public interest at the current time, and we have made the difficult decision to preempt his show in an effort to let cooler heads prevail as we move toward the resumption of respectful, constructive dialogue," Alford said.Carr, the FCC chief, in a post on X wrote: "I want to thank Nexstar for doing the right thing. Local broadcasters have an obligation to serve the public interest.""While this may be an unprecedented decision, it is important for broadcasters to push back on Disney programming that they determine falls short of community values. I hope that other broadcasters follow Nexstar's lead," Carr wrote.In June, ABC News cut ties with star national correspondent Terry Moran after he called Trump and senior White House advisor Stephen Miller "world-class" haters in a social media post.Last December, ABC News agreed to pay $15 million toward Trump's future presidential library to settle a lawsuit by the president against the network and anchor George Stephanopoulos over Stephanopoulos' inaccurate claim in March 2024 that a federal jury had found the president civilly liable for raping writer E.
