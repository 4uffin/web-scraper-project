I want them to understand that time is money, so I introduce the concept of "time robbers," or the meaningless tasks and distractions that pull you away from your most important work. I also give them the framework I use to organize my day: My Time (morning edition), Prime Time, Down Time, and then My Time (evening edition). I assign the highest monetary value to the Prime Time hours, followed by the morning My Time, Down Time and then evening My Time.This formula isn't a one-size-fits-all, or even strictly 9-to-5. It's about figuring out what is best for you. If you're starting a business, or already running one, you must treat your time like the valuable resource that it is.My Time (morning edition)This is the time you spend on yourself — before emails, meetings, or fires to put out. It's for preparation, clarity, and grounding.Think of yourself as a pro athlete: They don't walk onto the field without warming up first. They mentally, physically, emotionally, and spiritually prepare for what is about to take place. They envision success at the highest level. For me, My Time begins when I wake up around 6:30 a.m. and goes until 9:00 a.m. I meditate, write in my journal, exercise or go for a walk, eat breakfast, read a few articles or a book, then shower and get ready for the next part of my day.  DON'T MISS: The ultimate guide to starting a business—everything you need to know to be your own boss Prime Time Mine runs from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. But yours may differ.For example, one of my client's ends her Prime Time at 3:30 p.m., when her kids get home from school. Another does a fair amount of work overseas, so she dedicates late nights (9:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m.) or early mornings (4:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m.) to her customers.Prime Time is when you earn your living and build your legacy. It's where every minute matters, and laser-like focus is required for success. I divide Prime Time into four subcategories to maximize productivity: Urgent tasks. These are non-negotiable. Deadline-driven and have to get done today. Mission-critical. Knock these out early when you have the most energy. Important tasks. These you will complete over the course of the week. They are tied to your strategic goals. They're not fires, but if ignored, they will become urgent. Schedule blocks for them after your urgent items are complete. Everyday tasks. This might look like updating your customer relationship management (CRM) software, scheduling social media posts, or reviewing documents. Important, but not time-sensitive. Non-essential tasks. Things like organizing files, unsubscribing from junk emails, or browsing articles. These belong at the bottom of the priority ladder. My best advice is to take a 10-minute break every hour. Walk around. Stretch. Hydrate. A well-rested brain is a focused brain. Down TimeThis is the wrap-up phase. Mine is from 5:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. During your Down Time, you're not off-the-clock, but you're not focusing on high-value work either.You can: Answer emails, texts, and voicemails Return non-urgent calls Manage every day and non-essential tasks Prepare your prime time schedule for tomorrow This is about finishing the day strong and putting yourself in the best position to succeed tomorrow.My Time (evening edition)Log off. Shut down. Go live your life. Spend time with family, friends, or by yourself. Read, cook, laugh, walk the dog, or catch up with someone important.Whatever recharges your battery, do that. And try to go to bed at a reasonable hour. Tomorrow is another opportunity to get better. Remember, time is your currency. Too many business owners spend their $500 time doing $100 tasks. That's how time robbers steal from you. Don't be your own worst time robber!Brian Moran is the founder and CEO of Small Business Edge, Brian Moran & Associates, and co-founder of Bricks or Sticks, three companies dedicated to helping all business owners run better, more efficient, and more productive companies.Want to be your own boss? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Start A Business: For First-Time Founders.
