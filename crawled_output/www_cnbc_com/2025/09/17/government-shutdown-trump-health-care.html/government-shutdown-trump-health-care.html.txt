"If the government is shut down because they make that their last stand, it will solely be blamed on Democrats."Both parties in Congress typically try to pin blame on the other guys for government shutdowns, which are universally unpopular with voters.Read more CNBC politics coverageJohnson says Democrats will 'lose that battle' if shutdown hinges on ACA subsidiesSpeaker Johnson says China is straining U.S. relations with Nvidia chip banThree things Britain wants from Trump's state visit — aside from business dealsTrump and Epstein image projected on Windsor Castle as president visits UKRCI Hospitality strip club execs bribed tax auditor with comped dances: NY AGCharlie Kirk shooting suspect charged with murder, faces possible death penalty'Gaza is burning': Israel launches ground invasion of strip's largest cityTrump administration moves to limit fallout from Hyundai immigration raidThe UK is about to embrace Trump.

For Americans in rural areas, they could increase by 90%.But even a stopgap funding bill faces a difficult path forward in the Senate, where it requires 60 votes to pass.To get it over the finish, at least seven Democrats would need to cross party lines to vote with Republicans on the bill.This may prove more difficult this year than it has in previous shutdown battles, however.Senate Democrats led by Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York are eager to avoid a repeat of the March shutdown showdown.At the time, Schumer and other Democrats joined Republicans to fund the government for six months.But the decision triggered blowback from Democratic voters, who accused their party of folding too fast."The House Republican-only spending bill fails to meet the needs of the American people and does nothing to stop the looming healthcare crisis," Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said in a statement on Tuesday.A prolonged shutdown could also hammer consumer sentiment and slow growth, Deutsche Bank analysts warned in a Wednesday note.They noted the labor market has weakened over the last six months at the fastest rate since 2007, excluding the pandemic.Under these conditions, "a negative shock" from a government shutdown could "prove more detrimental" to the economy than prior shutdowns.Subscribe to CNBC PROSubscribe to Investing ClubLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSelect Personal FinanceCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelSupply Chain ValuesClosed CaptioningDigital ProductsNews ReleasesInternshipsCorrectionsAbout CNBCAd ChoicesSite MapPodcastsCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?
