"If the government is shut down because they make that their last stand, it will solely be blamed on Democrats."Both parties in Congress typically try to pin blame on the other guys for government shutdowns, which are universally unpopular with voters.Read more CNBC politics coverageNew York City mayor candidate Curtis Sliwa says he was offered money to quit raceTrump's tennis invite from Rolex echoes Apple, Nvidia playbook for currying favor, Warren says2 dead in Dallas ICE shooting, including suspect; FBI eyes ideological motiveTrump UN escalator snafu: White House wants investigation of sudden stopTrump cancels meeting with top Democrats as government shutdown loomsEurope's work-life balance a key talent draw as Trump revamps H-1B visaTrump-Xi meeting likely to happen next year, says U.S. ambassador to ChinaTrump to meet top Dems as their health care demands fuel government shutdown riskSupreme Court lets Trump fire FTC's Slaughter for nowJimmy Kimmel suspension, Trump book, Epstein note eyed in ABC affiliate shootingIf the tax credits disappear, average ACA plan premiums could increase by roughly 75% for millions of Americans, according to KFF, a nonpartisan health policy think tank. For Americans in rural areas, they could increase by 90%.But even a stopgap funding bill faces a difficult path forward in the Senate, where it requires 60 votes to pass.To get it over the finish, at least seven Democrats would need to cross party lines to vote with Republicans on the bill.This may prove more difficult this year than it has in previous shutdown battles, however.Senate Democrats led by Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York are eager to avoid a repeat of the March shutdown showdown.At the time, Schumer and other Democrats joined Republicans to fund the government for six months.But the decision triggered blowback from Democratic voters, who accused their party of folding too fast."The House Republican-only spending bill fails to meet the needs of the American people and does nothing to stop the looming healthcare crisis," Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said in a statement on Tuesday.A prolonged shutdown could also hammer consumer sentiment and slow growth, Deutsche Bank analysts warned in a Wednesday note.They noted the labor market has weakened over the last six months at the fastest rate since 2007, excluding the pandemic.Under these conditions, "a negative shock" from a government shutdown could "prove more detrimental" to the economy than prior shutdowns.Subscribe to CNBC PROSubscribe to Investing ClubLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSelect Personal FinanceCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelSupply Chain ValuesClosed CaptioningDigital ProductsNews ReleasesInternshipsCorrectionsAbout CNBCAd ChoicesSite MapPodcastsCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?
