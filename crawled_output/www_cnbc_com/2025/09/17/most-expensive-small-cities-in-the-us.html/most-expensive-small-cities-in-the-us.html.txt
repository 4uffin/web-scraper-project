Known for their seasonal residents, the cities have median home values above $1 million, according to a September LendingTree analysis that compared home values in cities with populations between 10,000 and 50,000.Several of the top 10 most expensive small cities are located near prominent ski and snowboard areas. Jackson, Wyoming, is a 20-minute drive from Jackson Hole Mountain Resort; Hailey, Idaho, is near Sun Valley Ski Resort; both Breckenridge and Steamboat Springs are ski towns with resorts in Colorado.Not all of the most expensive small cities on LendingTree's list are vacation destinations, however.

"Really, it's a bunch of normal people with rich people that visit sometimes."Packish, who grew up on Martha's Vineyard, said much of the island's economy is backed by year-round residents who work service jobs to support the island's coffee shops, banks and grocery stores.Because of the high cost of property on the island, Packish, who earns $85,000 a year working in advertising and social media, said she lives rent-free in an apartment her father owns over the island's off-season, but moves in with her parents during the summer. "I wouldn't be able to live on Martha's Vineyard with my salary," she said.Want to be your own boss? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Start A Business: For First-Time Founders.
