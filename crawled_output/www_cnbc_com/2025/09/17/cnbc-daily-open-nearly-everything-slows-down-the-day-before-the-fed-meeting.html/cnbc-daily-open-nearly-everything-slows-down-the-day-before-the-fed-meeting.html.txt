If it feels like we have lived through a filler episode before the big season finale, well, that's because it's fairly accurate.Investors are anticipating the conclusion of the U.S. Federal Reserve's meeting Wednesday, when they get to hear its interest rate decision and Chair Jerome Powell's (arguably more important) press conference.Markets were hence in an awkward limbo Tuesday. U.S. stocks declined, but only mildly. The S&P 500 dipped 0.13% — but still closed above the 6,600 level it broke Monday — and even hit a fresh intraday record earlier in the session. In other words, investors didn't seem to want to make any big moves before the Fed's meeting ends.Even news that broke yesterday — while unrelated to the central bank and interest rates — were focused on casting an eye to the future rather than immediate developments. Further U.S.-China trade talks will happen before November, while a TikTok 'framework' deal to allow it to continue operating in the U.S. is expected to be finalized.All of that contributed to the feeling of watching the credits roll just as a cliffhanger occurred.(Spoiler alert: There'll almost definitely be a 25 basis points rate cut — an extra-large 50 point slash is unlikely, unless the "outies" of some Fed officials overpower their independent "innies.")What you need to know todayBessent sees a trade deal with China soon. The U.S. Treasury Secretary told CNBC he expects more talks with Beijing before "reciprocal" tariffs restart in November. Separately, Bessent said Trump's suggestion to scrap quarterly company reports will be good for investors.Oracle will maintain cloud deal with TikTok, sources say. That's part of the 'framework' agreement for TikTok, which will also include new and existing investors in its Chinese parent company ByteDance, sources told CNBC's David Faber.Tech firms pledge over $40 billion of AI investments in UK. Among the companies planning to expand their infrastructure there are Microsoft, Nvidia, Google and OpenAI. Their announcements come ahead of Trump's state visit to the U.K.U.S. stocks slip ahead of Fed meeting. All major indexes dipped slightly Tuesday, with tech shares such as Nvidia and Microsoft pulling back. Europe's Stoxx 600 index fell 1.14%, and all major regional bourses traded lower.[PRO] AI leaders in China are emerging. Mainland companies have been monetizing generative AI in the past two years, making it clearer which ones are succeeding. UBS has picked two of its favorites that look like they still have room to run.And finally...Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell speaks at Jackson Hole on Aug. 22, 2025 in Wyoming.David A. Grogan | CNBCFed set to cut rates, but forecast for rest of 2025 is key to markets with politics clouding the pictureThe Federal Reserve meets this week with some big items on the agenda: An important rate decision and forecast of what's ahead, combined with a healthy dose of political intrigue uncommon for central bank policymakers.On the monetary side, the Federal Open Market Committee on Wednesday will release its ruling on where it will set the overnight borrowing rate. Politically, there will be one new Fed governor, President Donald Trump's appointee Stephen Miran, who almost certainly will dissent from the widely expected decision to lower the federal funds rate by a quarter percentage point, opting for an even bigger cut.— Jeff Cox
