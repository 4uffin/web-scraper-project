Al Drago | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesA federal appeals court ruled Monday that President Donald Trump cannot fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook before the central bank's policy committee votes on whether to lower interest rates.The 2-1 ruling from a panel of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit means that Cook can participate in the Federal Open Market Committee's pivotal two-day meeting starting Tuesday.Trump's attorneys on Thursday had submitted an emergency request to pause a lower court ruling, which barred Cook's firing from taking effect while her lawsuit against the president's action continues.But they have "not satisfied the stringent requirements for a stay pending appeal," the appellate court ruled in its brief order Monday night.White House spokesman Kush Desai said the Trump administration will appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court."The President lawfully removed Lisa Cook for cause. The Administration will appeal this decision and looks forward to ultimate victory on the issue," Desai said in a statement.Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump says Murdochs are potential TikTok deal partnersThe U.S. states with the most — and least — H-1B visa applications and renewalsTrump aide denies Kimmel suspended because of WH pressure despite Carr threatBig Tech firms scramble after Trump slaps $100,000 fee on H-1B visasFormer Disney CEO Eisner backs Jimmy Kimmel, blasts FCC 'intimidation' of ABCTed Cruz compares FCC Chair Carr to Mafia boss in Jimmy Kimmel warningsTrump says 'I'm winning' after judge tosses his $15 billion NY Times lawsuitTrump, Xi make progress on TikTok deal, but more work remains, White House says'Tonight, we are all Jimmy Kimmel,' Colbert says, calling Trump an 'autocrat'Trump floats pulling licenses if networks are 'against' him after Kimmel suspendedTrump hints at 'good news' coming on the Russia-Ukraine warTrump admin asks Supreme Court to allow firing of Fed Governor Lisa CookFCC Chair Carr says 'we're not done yet' after Jimmy Kimmel suspension by ABCTrump moved to fire Cook in late August "for cause," citing allegations of mortgage fraud put forward by his administration's housing finance director, Bill Pulte.The move was unprecedented, though Trump, who wants interest rates slashed, has repeatedly shown little regard for concerns about the central bank's independence.He has frequently attacked Fed Chair Jerome Powell for refusing to lower rates, and at points considered trying to fire him, though the Supreme Court appeared to offer some cover for Powell in a May ruling.Trump has backed off the threats against Powell, but he has followed through on moving to fire Cook, an appointee of former President Joe Biden who has voted in lockstep with Powell.Cook sued to block her firing. She has denied committing mortgage fraud.The panel of three judges handling the appeal includes J. Michelle Childs and Bradley Garcia, two appointees of former President Joe Biden, who sided against Trump's bid for a quick stay.U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb, who blocked Cook's firing last week, was "correct" when she ruled that Trump's action likely violated the Constitution's due process clause, Garcia wrote in a concurring statement."For that reason — and because of the myriad unique features of this case as compared to other recent challenges to presidential removals — I vote to deny the government's emergency request for a stay pending appeal," Garcia wrote in his concurrence, which was joined by Childs.The third judge, Trump appointee Gregory Katsas, said in a dissenting statement that would have granted the president's request.Katsas said he disagreed with Cobb's findings that Cook cannot be removed for conduct that predated her appointment to the Fed, and that she has a constitutionally protected property interest in her office."In my view, both holdings are mistaken, and the equitable balance here tips in favor of the government," Katsas wrote. "So, I would grant the government's motion for a stay pending appeal."Don’t miss these insights from CNBC PROMarket track record is flawless when the Fed cuts rates with S&P 500 near record highFed rate cuts will make dividend stocks more appealing for income investors.
