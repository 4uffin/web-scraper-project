Al Drago | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesA federal appeals court ruled Monday that President Donald Trump cannot fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook before the central bank's policy committee votes on whether to lower interest rates.The 2-1 ruling from a panel of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit means that Cook can participate in the Federal Open Market Committee's pivotal two-day meeting starting Tuesday.Trump's attorneys on Thursday had submitted an emergency request to pause a lower court ruling, which barred Cook's firing from taking effect while her lawsuit against the president's action continues.But they have "not satisfied the stringent requirements for a stay pending appeal," the appellate court ruled in its brief order Monday night.White House spokesman Kush Desai said the Trump administration will appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court."The President lawfully removed Lisa Cook for cause. The Administration will appeal this decision and looks forward to ultimate victory on the issue," Desai said in a statement.Read more CNBC politics coverageNew York City mayor candidate Curtis Sliwa says he was offered money to quit raceTrump's tennis invite from Rolex echoes Apple, Nvidia playbook for currying favor, Warren says2 dead in Dallas ICE shooting, including suspect; FBI eyes ideological motiveTrump UN escalator snafu: White House wants investigation of sudden stopTrump cancels meeting with top Democrats as government shutdown loomsEurope's work-life balance a key talent draw as Trump revamps H-1B visaTrump-Xi meeting likely to happen next year, says U.S. ambassador to ChinaTrump to meet top Dems as their health care demands fuel government shutdown riskSupreme Court lets Trump fire FTC's Slaughter for nowJimmy Kimmel suspension, Trump book, Epstein note eyed in ABC affiliate shootingTrump moved to fire Cook in late August "for cause," citing allegations of mortgage fraud put forward by his administration's housing finance director, Bill Pulte.The move was unprecedented, though Trump, who wants interest rates slashed, has repeatedly shown little regard for concerns about the central bank's independence.He has frequently attacked Fed Chair Jerome Powell for refusing to lower rates, and at points considered trying to fire him, though the Supreme Court appeared to offer some cover for Powell in a May ruling.Trump has backed off the threats against Powell, but he has followed through on moving to fire Cook, an appointee of former President Joe Biden who has voted in lockstep with Powell.Cook sued to block her firing. She has denied committing mortgage fraud.The panel of three judges handling the appeal includes J. Michelle Childs and Bradley Garcia, two appointees of former President Joe Biden, who sided against Trump's bid for a quick stay.U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb, who blocked Cook's firing last week, was "correct" when she ruled that Trump's action likely violated the Constitution's due process clause, Garcia wrote in a concurring statement."For that reason — and because of the myriad unique features of this case as compared to other recent challenges to presidential removals — I vote to deny the government's emergency request for a stay pending appeal," Garcia wrote in his concurrence, which was joined by Childs.The third judge, Trump appointee Gregory Katsas, said in a dissenting statement that would have granted the president's request.Katsas said he disagreed with Cobb's findings that Cook cannot be removed for conduct that predated her appointment to the Fed, and that she has a constitutionally protected property interest in her office."In my view, both holdings are mistaken, and the equitable balance here tips in favor of the government," Katsas wrote. "So, I would grant the government's motion for a stay pending appeal."Don’t miss these insights from CNBC PROTrump's $100,000 visa plan could hit these companies the hardestGoldman Sachs raises S&P 500 target for year-endChina isn't begging for Nvidia anymore.
