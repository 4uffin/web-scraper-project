Comey, or because of her perceived political affiliation and beliefs, or both."The lawsuit names the Department of Justice, the Executive Office of the President and their respective leaders as defendants, along with the Office of Personnel Management and the Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys.The Justice Department declined CNBC's request for comment on the suit.Comey is the latest among dozens of DOJ employees who have turned to the courts after being terminated during Trump's second term.Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump says Murdochs are potential TikTok deal partnersThe U.S. states with the most — and least — H-1B visa applications and renewalsTrump aide denies Kimmel suspended because of WH pressure despite Carr threatBig Tech firms scramble after Trump slaps $100,000 fee on H-1B visasFormer Disney CEO Eisner backs Jimmy Kimmel, blasts FCC 'intimidation' of ABCTed Cruz compares FCC Chair Carr to Mafia boss in Jimmy Kimmel warningsTrump says 'I'm winning' after judge tosses his $15 billion NY Times lawsuitTrump, Xi make progress on TikTok deal, but more work remains, White House says'Tonight, we are all Jimmy Kimmel,' Colbert says, calling Trump an 'autocrat'Trump floats pulling licenses if networks are 'against' him after Kimmel suspendedTrump hints at 'good news' coming on the Russia-Ukraine warTrump admin asks Supreme Court to allow firing of Fed Governor Lisa CookFCC Chair Carr says 'we're not done yet' after Jimmy Kimmel suspension by ABCComey, like a number of other ousted government officials, had been targeted by Laura Loomer, a far-right activist who has taken credit for influencing the Trump administration to fire people.After Comey was fired in mid-July, Loomer boasted that the move followed "my pressure campaign on [Attorney General Pam Bondi] to fire Comey's daughter and Comey's son in law from the DOJ."Comey's husband, Lucas Issacharoff, "voluntarily resigned" from the DOJ in May, according to the lawsuit.Following her ouster, Comey warned that she was being made an example of in order to quell potential dissent within the DOJ."If a career prosecutor can be fired without reason, fear may seep into the decisions of those who remain," Comey wrote in a farewell note to staff at the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office."Fear is the tool of a tyrant, wielded to suppress independent thought. Instead of fear, let this moment fuel the fire that already burns in the heart of this place," she wrote. "A fire of righteous indignation at abuses of power. Of commitment to seek justice for victims."— CNBC's Jim Forkin contributed to this report.Correction: Maurene Comey's husband is Lucas Issacharoff.
