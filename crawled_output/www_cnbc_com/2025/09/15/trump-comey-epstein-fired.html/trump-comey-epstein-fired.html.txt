Comey, or because of her perceived political affiliation and beliefs, or both."The lawsuit names the Department of Justice, the Executive Office of the President and their respective leaders as defendants, along with the Office of Personnel Management and the Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys.The Justice Department declined CNBC's request for comment on the suit.Comey is the latest among dozens of DOJ employees who have turned to the courts after being terminated during Trump's second term.Read more CNBC politics coverageNew York City mayor candidate Curtis Sliwa says he was offered money to quit raceTrump's tennis invite from Rolex echoes Apple, Nvidia playbook for currying favor, Warren says2 dead in Dallas ICE shooting, including suspect; FBI eyes ideological motiveTrump UN escalator snafu: White House wants investigation of sudden stopTrump cancels meeting with top Democrats as government shutdown loomsEurope's work-life balance a key talent draw as Trump revamps H-1B visaTrump-Xi meeting likely to happen next year, says U.S. ambassador to ChinaTrump to meet top Dems as their health care demands fuel government shutdown riskSupreme Court lets Trump fire FTC's Slaughter for nowJimmy Kimmel suspension, Trump book, Epstein note eyed in ABC affiliate shootingComey, like a number of other ousted government officials, had been targeted by Laura Loomer, a far-right activist who has taken credit for influencing the Trump administration to fire people.After Comey was fired in mid-July, Loomer boasted that the move followed "my pressure campaign on [Attorney General Pam Bondi] to fire Comey's daughter and Comey's son in law from the DOJ."Comey's husband, Lucas Issacharoff, "voluntarily resigned" from the DOJ in May, according to the lawsuit.Following her ouster, Comey warned that she was being made an example of in order to quell potential dissent within the DOJ."If a career prosecutor can be fired without reason, fear may seep into the decisions of those who remain," Comey wrote in a farewell note to staff at the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office."Fear is the tool of a tyrant, wielded to suppress independent thought. Instead of fear, let this moment fuel the fire that already burns in the heart of this place," she wrote. "A fire of righteous indignation at abuses of power. Of commitment to seek justice for victims."— CNBC's Jim Forkin contributed to this report.Correction: Maurene Comey's husband is Lucas Issacharoff.
