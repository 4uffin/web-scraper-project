President Donald Trump implied in a social media post this morning that a TikTok deal has been reached with China, and he plans to speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping this coming Friday. Trade officials from both countries were talking in Spain over the weekend. 2. Trump, in a separate morning post, questioned whether companies should report their financial results on a quarterly basis and advocated moving to a semiannual system. 3. China said Nvidia violated its anti-monopoly law in relation to the Club name's acquisition of Mellanox in 2020. Could it be severe? It has not been in the past. Maybe a fine? Maybe a bargaining chip? Nvidia shares were down more than 1% on the news. 4. Melius Research boosted its price targets on Eaton and GE Vernova and upgraded both Club stocks to buys. The analysts like them as plays on powering the data center, which was the focus of my Sunday column . 5. Deutsche Bank believes CoreWeave , which rents Nvidia-driven AI computing power, is a short-term buy. The analysts cited an almost insatiable demand for AI infrastructure. 6. Wedbush said Club name Palo Alto Networks is one of the best ideas in cybersecurity. The analysts like the CyberArk deal and think fiscal year 2026 will be an "inflection year for the PANW platformization strategy." 7. The Club also owns cybersecurity name CrowdStrike , which holds its Fal.Con event this week and its investor day. Club holding DuPont also holds an investor day this week. We featured both in our look at the week ahead . 8. Wall Street is on Federal Reserve watch this week. The central bank is expected to cut interest rates at the conclusion of its two-day meeting Wednesday afternoon. The S & P 500 closed just shy of a record high Friday. 9. Wedbush downgraded Builders FirstSource on limited upside. You do not downgrade this stock with Fed rate cuts ahead, which will spur more homebuilding. The building supplier is more homebuilding play than Club name Home Depot , which I really like in the upcoming lower rate environment. 10. Barclays sees Tesla topping estimates for third quarter deliveries. I think it is becoming clear that the break with Trump has helped Tesla sales. Elon Musk bought 2.57 million shares, worth about $1 billion at Friday's prices. The stock jumped more than 7% this morning.
