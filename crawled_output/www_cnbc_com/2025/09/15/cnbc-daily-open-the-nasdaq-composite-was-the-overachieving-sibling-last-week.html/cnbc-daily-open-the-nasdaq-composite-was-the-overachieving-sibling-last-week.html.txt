The Nasdaq Composite was an overachiever last week. After ending Friday higher — outperforming the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average, both of which closed in the red — the tech-heavy index officially had five straight days of all-time closing highs.On a weekly basis, the Nasdaq Composite, with its 2% advance, also pulled ahead of the S&P 500's 1.6% increase and the Dow Jones Industrial Average's 1% rise.Given the Nasdaq Composite's moniker as the "tech-heavy index" (much favored by financial writers who have to come up with many ways to describe it), there's little surprise in saying that technology companies were the main engine for its finish at the top of the podium.But it's not just any tech. OpenAI seemed to be behind much of the market's rise, suggesting the artificial intelligence narrative is still compelling to investors. Shares of Oracle soared last week largely because of a deal it had made with the artificial intelligence firm; companies associated with it, such as Broadcom and Nvidia, have also had their share prices lifted previously.With a rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve all but certain to come this week — which would especially benefit cash-burning, debt-ridden, yet-to-be-profitable tech startups like OpenAI — the youngest of the three major U.S. indexes might continue to outshine its siblings in the near term.What you need to know todayU.S. and China discuss trade deal in Spain. On Sunday, officials from both countries arrived in Madrid to begin a round of discussions on their trade partnership and divestment plans for TikTok — the first time the app's come on the agenda.Nvidia and OpenAI discuss investing in UK. Even though a formal agreement has yet to be finalized, the deal — which aims to support data center development in the country — could be worth billions.Winklevoss' crypto exchange pops. During its first day of trading Friday, Gemini Space Station shares jumped 14.3%. The New York-based company posted a net loss of $283 million in the first half of the year.Nasdaq Composite has a perfect week of record highs. The tech-heavy index rose 0.44% on Friday, sealing its unblemished run for the week. Other major U.S. indexes declined. The FTSE 100 lost 0.15%, as the U.K. economy showed no growth in July.[PRO] Fed meeting the marquee event for this week. Investors are expecting the U.S. central bank to lower interest rates at their meeting this week, which concludes on Sept. 17. That move could turbocharge stocks.And finally...Xpeng CEO He Xiaopeng speaks to reporters at the electric carmaker's stand at the IAA auto show in Munich, Germany on September 8, 2025. Arjun Kharpal | CNBCChinese EV players take fight to legacy European automakers on their home turfGermany last week played host to one of the world's biggest auto shows — but in the heartland of Europe's auto industry, it was buzzy Chinese electric car companies looking to outshine some of the region's biggest brands on their home turf.Europe has become a focal point for the Asian firms. It's a market where the traditional automakers are seen to be lagging in the development of electric vehicles, even as they ramp up releases of new cars. At the same time, Tesla, which was for so long seen as the electric vehicle market leader, has seen sales decline in the region.— Arjun Kharpal
