The strong gains look set to continue for TSLA from a technical perspective, noting the stock is far from overbought territory per the monthly stochastics, and the upper boundary of a secular uptrend channel puts resistance above $500. (Read about why Tesla is jumping Monday on a big insider purchase from Elon Musk here .) The bullish action in TSLA leads us to the charts of other EV companies, such as China-based NIO (NIO) , as another way to benefit from the sector's momentum. NIO has advanced from a long-term basing phase after having established a major low in April alongside the U.S. equity market. The subsequent breakout lifted NIO above key resistance from the weekly cloud model, a long-term trend following tool denoted by the shaded area on the chart. This marks a bullish reversal, and the new uptrend is supported by positive intermediate-term momentum per the weekly MACD indicator. The base breakout in NIO acts as a bullish long-term catalyst for the stock, both in absolute and relative terms. The relative strength ratio versus the S & P 500 Index (SPX) now points higher above its 12-month moving average (MA). The monthly MACD points higher, as well, and a recent oversold upturn in the monthly stochastics enhances a counter-trend signal logged by the DeMARK Indicators in April. Taken together, the indicators are supportive of 6+ months of upside follow-through. Should NIO decisively clear resistance at $7.00 derived from former support at the mid-2023 low, that would be another positive technical catalyst for the stock, noting the next big hurdle on the chart is a 50% retracement level at $9.60. Support for NIO can be gauged by the weekly cloud model, which sits at $5.36 through year-end. Because this level is well below current levels, and because EV stocks tend to be more volatile than the broader market, risk management is warranted via a percentage-based stop-loss discipline. —Katie Stockton with Will Tamplin Access research from Fairlead Strategies for free here .
