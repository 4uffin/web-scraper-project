Shortly after the opening bell, we will be selling 35 shares of Broadcom at roughly $358.75. Following the trade, Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust will own 515 shares of AVGO, decreasing its weighting to 5.0% from roughly 5.30%. We are no longer restricted from trading Broadcom, allowing us to sell some shares on Monday. We originally announced our intent to trim our position on Thursday. This trim does not reflect a change in our long-held belief in Broadcom's accelerating AI revenues. Rather, we are selling some shares to right-size what has become the largest position in the portfolio following a stretch of significant outperformance. Broadcom has been one of the best-performing stocks in the portfolio all year, thanks to a gain of about 55%. But the stock has been especially on fire ever since the semiconductor and software company reported earnings on Sept. 4 and revealed a new mystery customer of its custom AI chip services. Media reports suggest the new buyer is OpenAI. Broadcom shares are up roughly 17% since earnings, crushing the S & P 500's return of about 1%. From this sale, we will realize a strong gain of about 311% on stock purchased in September 2023. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long AVGO. See here for a full list of the stocks.)
