Here's a recap of Monday's key moments. 1. The S & P 500 hit an all-time high Monday as the market welcomed President Donald Trump 's positive update that trade talks between the U.S. and China were going "very well." Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the two sides reached a "framework" deal on TikTok, which is owned by China-based ByteDance. Elsewhere, investors are also looking ahead to Wednesday's expected Federal Reserve interest rate cut. And, with tech up Monday, we took some profits to reduce our outsized Broadcom position weight in the portfolio. The stock has been on fire since earnings earlier this month. On Thursday, we let members know we were looking to trim when we weren't restricted. 2. Nvidia shares were flat Monday after the U.S. chipmaker was accused by China of breaking antitrust laws. But this idea "that maybe there's some good movement in trading talks with China may be good, makes me even less worried about Nvidia," and news of the investigation, Jim Cramer said. According to China's market regulators, Nvidia's acquisition of Israeli tech company Mellanox in 2020 violated conditions of China's anti-monopoly law. Jim believes the move by China is "politically motivated." Last month, Nvidia cut a deal with the U.S. government to allow exports of some of its chips to China. "I am hoping that this company is part of a comprehensive deal" in trade negotiations with China, Jim said. 3. "We need to buy a lot more Boeing, " Jim said Monday. The Club started a position in the aircraft giant on Sept. 8 and added shares Friday. Boeing shares have fallen roughly 5.8% since our initiation, likely due to the latest reports that the company is behind on certifying its newest 777X jet. But for Jim, this is another shot to load up. "I really want to pound the table on Boeing," Jim said, reiterating that members should "own" the stock. 4. Stocks covered in Monday's rapid fire at the end of the video were: Tesla Inc ., VF Corp. , CoreWeave , Union Pacific , and Builders FirstSource .
