See the full discussion above.) NYSE insider Jay Woods gives what pro traders are watching into the Federal Reserve rate decision Wednesday, seeing a potential breakout in a popular trade on the central bank's call. Small cap-focused Russell 2000 is "knocking on the door" of a breakout, according to Woods, chief market strategist at Freedom Capital Markets. Woods gives the key levels to watch for the trade. The iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) tracks the small cap index. (Watch full video above.) Woods, a trader at the Big Board for three decades, touches on in the exclusive video: Why the most important part of the Fed decision Wednesday will be the central bank's forecast, the so-called dot plot. Traders watching the 10-year Treasury yield this week and how a break below 4% could trigger a "flush out." Three key stocks with earnings this week: Lennar, FedEx and General Mills. The trader remarks that Lennar is forming a "phenomenal" base in the charts.
