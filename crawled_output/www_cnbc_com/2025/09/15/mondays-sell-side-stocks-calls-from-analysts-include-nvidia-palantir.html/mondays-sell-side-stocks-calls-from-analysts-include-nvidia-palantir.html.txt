Citi upgrades Valley National to buy from neutral Citi says it is bullish on shares of the New Jersey-based regional bank. "While a lower deposit cost should drive a stronger than peer [net interest margin] expansion trend over the next year (or more), we believe VLY is also likely to focus on its already strong expense management trends throughout 2H25 and 2026, supportive to both stronger loan growth trends (via hires) with a limited net expense growth outlook."
