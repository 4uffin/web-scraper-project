"In tracking delivery lead-times across key markets, including U.S., China, Germany and UK as an indicator of demand, while it is still very early days, lead-times for delivery are indicating that demand for all the new variants launched on Sep 9th is tracking modestly ahead of iPhone 16 Series during Week 1, with the higher demand particularly notable for Base version as well as Air." Melius upgrades GE Vernova to buy from neutral The research firm sees upside to estimates. "What makes GE Vernova outperform from here?

"We believe Tesla and Musk are heading into a very important chapter of their growth story as the AI Revolution takes hold and the Robotaxi opportunity is now a reality on the doorstep."

UBS initiates Smurfit Westrock at buy UBS says it sees growth potential from the paper and packaging company. "We initiate coverage of SW with a Buy rating ($60/sh PT).

Citi upgrades Valley National to buy from neutral Citi says it is bullish on shares of the New Jersey-based regional bank. "While a lower deposit cost should drive a stronger than peer [net interest margin] expansion trend over the next year (or more), we believe VLY is also likely to focus on its already strong expense management trends throughout 2H25 and 2026, supportive to both stronger loan growth trends (via hires) with a limited net expense growth outlook." Rothschild & Redburn downgrades Under Armour to neutral from buy The firm says in its downgrade of Under Armour that turnarounds are "hard."

Our top picks are AI-heavy NVDA, AVGO, MRVL, and MPWR." Rothschild & Redburn reiterates Disney as buy The firm raises its price target on the stock to $160 per share from $147. "The upcoming merger of Disney+ and Hulu should drive higher engagement and lower subscriber churn. When coupled with improved content discovery, we believe Disney can deliver strong and consistent streaming revenue growth — essential if investors are to have confidence in multi-year double-digit EPS growth." Rothschild & Redburn initiates Kyivstar at buy Rothschild & Co Redburn says the Ukraine telecommunications company is a market share gainer. "However, for those expecting peace, Kyivstar's leading market position, high margins, healthy cash generation and exciting digital service strategy offer profitable growth, elusive to most developed-market telcos." Wedbush reiterates MongoDB as outperform The firm added the cloud software company to its best ideas list. "We maintain our OUTPERFORM rating and believe MongoDB is now starting to hit its next stride as the AI use cases expand significantly over the coming years.
