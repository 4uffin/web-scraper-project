Trump also said in a Truth Social post Monday that a deal was reached "on a 'certain' company that young people in our Country very much wanted to save."Bessent indicated the framework could pivot the platform to U.S.-controlled ownership.TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.China's lead trade negotiator, Li Chenggang, confirmed the framework deal was in place and said the U.S. should not continue to suppress Chinese companies, according to Reuters.The remarks came during the latest round of trade discussions between the U.S. and China. Relations have soured between the two countries in recent months from Trump's tariffs and other trade restrictions.At the same time, TikTok parent company ByteDance faces a Sept. 17 deadline to divest the platform's U.S. business or potentially be shut down in the country.U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said Monday that the deadline may need to be pushed back to get the deal signed, but there won't be ongoing extensions.Read more CNBC tech newsChina says Nvidia violated anti-monopoly law after preliminary probe5 fintechs that could be next to IPO after KlarnaApple, Google and Meta are trying to perfect a science fiction gadget: The universal translator'We will do better.'

Further extensions came by way of executive orders in April and in June.Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in July that TikTok would shutter for Americans if China doesn't give the U.S. more autonomy over the popular short-form video app.As for who controls the platform, Trump told Fox News in June that he had a group of "very wealthy people" ready to buy the app and could reveal their identities in two weeks. The reveal never came.He has previously said he'd be open to Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison or Tesla CEO Elon Musk buying TikTok in the U.S. Artificial intelligence startup Perplexity has submitted a bid for an acquisition, as has businessman Frank McCourt's Project Liberty internet advocacy group, CNBC reported in January.Trump told CNBC in an interview last year that he believed the platform was a national security threat, although the White House started a TikTok account in August.Don’t miss these insights from CNBC PRONobel winner Joseph Stiglitz has a warning for bond investorsAs traditional 60/40 portfolios get riskier, BlackRock says investors should rethink their allocationsGoldman adds Walmart to September 'conviction list.'
