The Nasdaq Composite was an overachiever last week. After ending Friday higher — outperforming the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average, both of which closed in the red — the tech-heavy index officially had five straight days of all-time closing highs.On a weekly basis, the Nasdaq Composite, with its 2% advance, also pulled ahead of the S&P 500's 1.6% increase and the Dow Jones Industrial Average's 1% rise.Given the Nasdaq Composite's moniker as the "tech-heavy index" (much favored by financial writers who have to come up with many ways to describe it), there's little surprise in saying that technology companies were the main engine for its finish at the top of the podium.But it's not just any tech. OpenAI seemed to be behind much of the market's rise, suggesting the artificial intelligence narrative is still compelling to investors. Shares of Oracle soared last week largely because of a deal it had made with the artificial intelligence firm; companies associated with it, such as Broadcom and Nvidia, have also had their share prices lifted previously.With a rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve all but certain to come this week — which would especially benefit cash-burning, debt-ridden, yet-to-be-profitable tech startups like OpenAI — the youngest of the three major U.S. indexes might continue to outshine its siblings in the near term.What you need to know todayU.S. and China discuss trade deal in Spain. On Sunday, officials from both countries arrived in Madrid to begin a round of discussions on their trade partnership and divestment plans for TikTok — the first time the app's come on the agenda.China's economic slowdown deepens. The country's retail sales and industrial output declined in August and fell short of estimates, while growth of fixed-asset investments declined on a year-to-date basis.Europe's initial public offering market lags behind. When Sweden's Klarna chose to list in New York instead of Europe, it was a sign of how much the continent was being eclipsed by the U.S. and Asia for companies looking to go public.Nasdaq Composite has a perfect week of record highs. The tech-heavy index rose 0.44% on Friday, sealing its unblemished run for the week. South Korea's Kospi index touched a record high early Monday as the government reversed its tax-hike plan.[PRO] Fed meeting the marquee event for this week. Investors are expecting the U.S. central bank to lower interest rates at their meeting this week, which concludes on Sept. 17. That move could turbocharge stocks.And finally...Two humanoid robots are on display at the China Mobile booth at the Mobile World Conference in Shanghai on June 19, 2025.Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesIs the humanoid robot industry ready for its ChatGPT moment?Humanoid robots, which have made significant technological advances this year, may be at the precipice of a ChatGPT-like spike in investment and popularity — or at least, that's what many in the industry believe. Companies such as UBTech Robotics and Galbot, have also installed robots in local factories, according to local media reports. According to Zhao Yuli, chief strategy officer at Galbot, these deployments have come alongside a surge of investor interest and government support in the sector, as well as the maturation of both robotics and generative AI technology. — Dylan Butts and Victoria Yeo
