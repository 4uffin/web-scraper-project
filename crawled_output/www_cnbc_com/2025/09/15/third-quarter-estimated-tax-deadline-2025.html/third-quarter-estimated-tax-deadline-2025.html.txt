Why payments could be more complicatedPublished Mon, Sep 15 20253:03 PM EDTKate Dore, CFP®, EA@in/katedore/WATCH LIVEKey PointsThe third-quarter estimated tax deadline for 2025 is Sept. 15, but some payments could be more complicated amid recent tax law changes.  Typically, you should make estimated payments for earnings from self-employment, freelancing or gig economy.Electronic payments are the "most secure, fastest and easiest way to pay," according to the IRS.Millions of Americans live abroad and still have to pay taxes in the U.S.Kseniya Ovchinnikova | Moment | Getty ImagesThe third-quarter estimated tax deadline is Sept. 15 — and payments could be more complicated for some filers amid President Donald Trump's tax changes for 2025, experts say. Typically, you should make estimated payments for income without a tax withholding, like earnings from self-employment, freelancing or gig economy work. You may also need payments for investing profits, such as interest, dividends, capital gains or rental income. Quarterly payments can help reduce taxes owed and "possible underpayment penalties," the IRS said in a June news release.More from Financial Advisor Playbook:Here's a look at other stories affecting the financial advisor business.He invented the 4% rule — why he calls inflation retirees’ ‘greatest enemy’Treasury released early list for ‘no tax on tips’ deduction, but some jobs won’t qualifyThere’s a ‘golden opportunity’ to pay 0% capital gains under Trump’s tax billElectronic payments are the "most secure, fastest and easiest way to pay," according to the IRS. You can use your IRS Online Account, Direct Pay or the Electronic Federal Tax Payment System (EFTPS).Some payments could be harder to calculateTrump's "big beautiful bill" enacted several tax breaks that apply to 2025, and without changes to paycheck withholdings, some taxpayers could overpay through the end of the year, experts say.  For some filers, that could make quarterly estimated taxes for the third and fourth quarter of 2025 more difficult, experts say."I don't want them paying more taxes for Q3 and Q4 than they absolutely need to," said certified financial planner Jim Guarino, managing director at Baker Newman Noyes in Woburn, Massachusetts. He is also a certified public accountant.The quarterly tax deadlines for 2025 are April 15, June 16, Sept. 15 and Jan. 15, 2026. However, these due dates can be easy to miss since they don't align with calendar quarters, experts say.Quarterly tax deadlines for 2025Jan. 1 – March 31 (1st quarter): April 15April 1 – May 31 (2nd quarter): June 16June 1 – Aug. 31 (3rd quarter): Sept. 15Sept. 1 - Dec. 31 (4th quarter): Jan. 15, 2026Estimated payments aren't 'one-size-fits-all'You can avoid an underpayment penalty by following the safe harbor guidelines, experts say.To follow the rule, you must pay at least 90% of your 2025 taxes or 100% of your 2024 taxes, whichever is smaller.That threshold jumps to 110% if your 2024 adjusted gross income was $150,000 or more, which you can find on line 11 of Form 1040 from your 2024 tax return.However, the safe harbor protects you only from underpayment penalties. If you don't pay enough, you could still owe taxes for 2025, experts say."There's not a one-size-fits-all" for estimated tax payments, said Melanie Lauridsen, vice president of tax policy and advocacy at the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.By working with a tax professional, they can run projections for 2025 to help decide the right payments for Q3 and Q4, she said.More In Financial Advisor PlaybookThese are the red flags to watch out for when picking a financial advisor, experts sayJessica DicklerHow to invest in gold as bullion surges to record high above $3,700Jessica DicklerCar shoppers — following one rule can help keep costs down, CFP saysAna Teresa SoláRead MoreSubscribe to CNBC PROSubscribe to Investing ClubLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSelect Personal FinanceCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelSupply Chain ValuesClosed CaptioningDigital ProductsNews ReleasesInternshipsCorrectionsAbout CNBCAd ChoicesSite MapPodcastsCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?
