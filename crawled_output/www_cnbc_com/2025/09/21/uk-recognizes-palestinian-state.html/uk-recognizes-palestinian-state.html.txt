"That means a safe and secure Israel alongside a viable Palestinian state — at the moment we have neither."Britain's decision has angered its close ally Israel as well as the United States, which argues that recognition emboldens extremists and rewards Hamas, the group that led the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attacks on Israel that killed some 1,200 people and left around 250 taken hostage, marking a major escalation in the decades-long conflict.Recognition of a Palestinian state is "nothing but a reward for jihadist Hamas — emboldened by its Muslim Brotherhood affiliated in the U.K.," Israel's foreign ministry said on X."Hamas leaders themselves openly admit: this recognition is a direct outcome, the 'fruit' for the 7 October massacre," it said.The Hostage and Missing Families Forum, a group representing hostage families, condemned the decision to recognize a Palestinian state, while "turning a blind eye" to the hostages that remain in captivity."We believe that any discussion about recognizing a Palestinian state must be contingent upon the immediate release of all hostages," it said in a statement Sunday.Starmer said recognition was "not a reward for Hamas," because it means Hamas can have no future, and no role in government. Albanese also said Hamas must have "no role in Palestine."The U.K.'s recognition is part of a wider shift among U.S. allies, bringing them closer to the more than 140 out of 193, U.N. member states that have already recognized Palestine as a state.France is expected to formally declare its recognition of a Palestinian state on Monday at a United Nations conference in New York co-chaired with Saudi Arabia, coinciding with the start of the U.N. General Assembly.French President Emmanuel Macron told Israeli television Channel 12 on Saturday that nations "have to recognize the legitimate right of Palestinian people to have a state."He also denounced Israel's new ground offensive in Gaza City as "absolutely unacceptable" and "a huge mistake."Portugal also confirmed Saturday it would recognize a Palestinian state on Sunday.Other countries on the brink of recognition include Belgium, Portugal, Luxembourg and New Zealand, which are likely to act either immediately before or at the U.N. special conference on a two-state solution in New York on Monday.Spain, Norway and Ireland recognized a state of Palestine last year.The creation of a Palestinian state refers to the West Bank and Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital. Israel currently occupies both the West Bank and Gaza, meaning the Palestinian Authority is not in full control of its land or people.Israeli authorities recently approved a new settlement project that ultranationalist lawmakers as a death knell for dreams of Palestinian statehood.Subscribe to CNBC PROSubscribe to Investing ClubLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSelect Personal FinanceCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelSupply Chain ValuesClosed CaptioningDigital ProductsNews ReleasesInternshipsCorrectionsAbout CNBCAd ChoicesSite MapPodcastsCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?
