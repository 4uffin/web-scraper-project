CNBC's Sophie Kiderlin has covered the other side of that coin.In London's Canary Wharf, CNBC will take "Squawk Box Europe" on the road, with Steve Sedgwick and Ritika Gupta set to speak with the bosses of some of the biggest financial groups about the revival of this financial hub over the last few years.With almost 15 and a half million square feet of office space available, big banks are returning and new brands are now leasing as the financial sector continues to lead the push to get employees back into offices.Canary Wharf group states that "2025 is set to be the highest year for office leasing in the last decade" with footfall topping a record 72 million in the last year. Here's more on Londons' return to office.In Paris, where the great and the good of the private markets world are set to meet, CNBC's Julianna Tatelbaum will be live at the IPEM event. Earlier this year, her coverage from SuperReturn in Berlin also highlighted a sense of optimism in Europe, as private investors at the time sought to hedge against U.S. policy uncertainty.This could nevertheless prove to be the dark spot in our optimistic picture: Morningstar states there has been a "notable reduction in capital inflows to private equity funds" in the first half of this year, citing delayed exits as causing fundraising bottlenecks.But when the going gets tough, what better than sport to lift the spirits?And so to Dublin, which will on Sept. 28 host an international NFL game between the Pittsburg Steelers and the Minnesota Vikings.The Irish capital's Croke Park stadium can hold 82,300 fans as one of America's most popular sports aims to win over a new European fan base.A detail of a Minnesota Vikings helmet prior to the game against the Chicago Bears at Soldier Field on October 15, 2023 in Chicago, Illinois.Michael Reaves | Getty ImagesCNBC's coverage plans:Monday: Goldman Sachs/Berenberg ConferenceTuesday: Goldman Sachs/Berenberg ConferenceWednesday: Squawk on the Road Canary WharfThursday: IPEM Private Markets eventFriday: IPEM Private Markets eventSubscribe to CNBC PROSubscribe to Investing ClubLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSelect Personal FinanceCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelSupply Chain ValuesClosed CaptioningDigital ProductsNews ReleasesInternshipsCorrectionsAbout CNBCAd ChoicesSite MapPodcastsCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?
