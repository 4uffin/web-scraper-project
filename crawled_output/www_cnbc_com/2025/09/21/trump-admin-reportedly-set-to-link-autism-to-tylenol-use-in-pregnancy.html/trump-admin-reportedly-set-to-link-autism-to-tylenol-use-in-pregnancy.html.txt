Kylie Cooper | ReutersThe Trump administration plans to announce Monday that pregnant women's use of Tylenol is potentially linked to autism, according to The Washington Post.Federal health officials are expected to warn women against using Tylenol early on in pregnancy unless they have a fever, the Post reported on Sunday, citing four people familiar with the matter. Officials will also highlight a form of folate, known as leucovorin, as a potential autism treatment, according to the report.The Department of Health and Human Services and the White House didn't immediately respond to CNBC requests for comment.President Donald Trump said Saturday that his administration would make an announcement related to autism on Monday."I think it's going to be a very important announcement," Trump said during remarks at an event hosted by the American Cornerstone Institute. "I think it's going to be one of the most important things that we will do."The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month that HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. would soon release a report tying the use of the common painkiller acetaminophen, the generic name for Tylenol, during pregnancy to autism. Shares of Tylenol maker Kenvue fell sharply following the report.A Kenvue spokesperson told CNBC in a statement that "over a decade of rigorous research, endorsed by leading medical professionals and global health regulators," shows there's no credible evidence linking acetaminophen to autism. "We believe independent, sound science clearly shows that taking acetaminophen does not cause autism," the spokesperson said. "We strongly disagree with any suggestion otherwise and are deeply concerned with the health risk this poses for expecting mothers."Tylenol added a section to its site addressing "recent media coverage," stating that there's "no proven link between taking acetaminophen and autism."Kenvue CEO Kirk Perry met with Kennedy earlier this month to stress that message, and try to discourage him from including Tylenol as a potential cause of autism in an upcoming report on the disorder, according to a separate report from The Wall Street Journal.Kenvue executives also said that there are few safe alternatives to acetaminophen to reduce fevers in pregnant women, the Journal reported.The Food and Drug Administration and leading medical organizations also have maintained that acetaminophen is safe during pregnancy when taken as directed but advise individuals to consult their health-care provider before using any over-the-counter drugs.Kennedy has made autism a key focus of the HHS, pledging to "get to the bottom" of the neurodevelopmental condition's cause. He's shared unsupported claims about autism in the past surrounding its prevalence and its causes.— CNBC's Annika Kim Constantino contributed reporting.Subscribe to CNBC PROSubscribe to Investing ClubLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSelect Personal FinanceCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelSupply Chain ValuesClosed CaptioningDigital ProductsNews ReleasesInternshipsCorrectionsAbout CNBCAd ChoicesSite MapPodcastsCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?
