It added that it was looking to resolve the issue as soon as possible.CNBC has contacted RTX for comment and is awaiting a response.Which airports are affected?Aviation analytics provider Cirium told CNBC that on Sunday so far, 38 departures and 33 arrivals had been canceled across Heathrow, Berlin and Brussels, as of 10 a.m. London time.On Saturday, 35 departures and 25 arrivals were canceled. Brussels saw the highest number of flight cancellations, at 15.All three airports issued updated statements Sunday.Heathrow said it was working to "resolve and recover" following the Collins outage that impacted check-in.Passengers continue to wait at the Brussels Airport as European airports are experiencing disruptions due to a cyberattack on the check-in and boarding system in Brussels, Belgium on Sept. 20, 2025. Anadolu | Anadolu | Getty Images"We apologise to those who have faced delays, but by working together with airlines, the vast majority of flights have continued to operate," it said on X. "We encourage passengers to check the status of their flight before travelling to Heathrow and to arrive no earlier than three hours for long-haul flights and two hours for short-haul."Brussels said on its website Sunday that the cyberattack was having "a large impact on the flight schedule and unfortunately causes delays and cancellations of flights." It advised travelers to check their flight status before leaving for the airport.Berlin warned travelers of longer waiting times due to a "systems outage at a service provider."Dublin Airport was also affected, but said it expects to operate a full schedule on Sunday."Some airlines in Terminal 2 are continuing to use manual workarounds to generate bag tags and boarding passes. This means that the check-in and bag drop processes may take slightly longer than normal," the airport said on X.Latest in a line of cyberattacksThe attack on Collins Aerospace is the latest in a series of high-profile cybersecurity breaches that have made headlines.Jaguar Land Rover said last week that it was extending a pause in production until Sept. 24 following a cyberattack. "We have taken this decision as our forensic investigation of the cyber incident continues, and as we consider the different stages of the controlled restart of our global operations, which will take time," the company said in a statement.While British retailer Marks & Spencer earlier this year said a recent cyberattack, which left food shelves bare and brought online sales to a standstill, would wipe out almost one-third of its annual profits.However, Charlotte Wilson, head of enterprise at cybersecurity firm Check Point, noted that the aviation industry was a particularly target for cybercriminals given its reliance on shared digital systems."These attacks often strike through the supply chain, exploiting third-party platforms that are used by multiple airlines and airports at once," she said in an emailed statement. "When one vendor is compromised, the ripple effect can be immediate and far-reaching, causing widespread disruption across borders."To improve resiliency, she said aviation companies should ensure software systems are regularly updated and well-tested backup systems are in place. She also called for better information-sharing between the technology providers, airlines and governments."Cyberattacks rarely stop at national borders, so the faster one country can identify and report an attack, the faster others can take action to contain it," she said. "A joined-up defence will be far more effective than siloed responses."Subscribe to CNBC PROSubscribe to Investing ClubLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSelect Personal FinanceCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelSupply Chain ValuesClosed CaptioningDigital ProductsNews ReleasesInternshipsCorrectionsAbout CNBCAd ChoicesSite MapPodcastsCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?
