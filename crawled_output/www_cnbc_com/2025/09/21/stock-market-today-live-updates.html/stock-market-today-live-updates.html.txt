NYSEThe S&P 500 reached new heights on Monday, led by a move higher in Nvidia, as a partnership announcement with OpenAI fueled investor optimism about the future of artificial intelligence.The broad market index ended the day up 0.44% at 6,693.75, while the Nasdaq Composite jumped 0.70% to finish at 22,788.98. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 66.27 points, or 0.14%, to settle at 46,381.54. Along with the S&P 500, the Nasdaq and Dow had hit new all-time intraday highs during the session and closed at record highs.While stocks began the trading day lower, they ultimately finished the day higher, being propped up by Nvidia and others. Shares of the AI chip darling advanced 3.9% after the company said it's going to invest $100 billion in OpenAI for the buildout of data centers. The new deal could signify that the AI trade will continue to "drive EPS and share price growth into 2026 and beyond," according to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research.Fellow AI-related name Oracle was also a winner Monday after the software giant announced that it has promoted Clay Magouyrk and Mike Sicilia to co-CEOs as Safra Catz takes a step back to serve as executive vice chair on the company's board. Oracle's 6% climb Monday adds to the stock's sizable 45% run this month.Apple shares similarly saw a meaningful 4% boost on enthusiasm about new iPhone sales.That said, the growing risk of a government shutdown is limiting the market's gains. Last week, the Senate rejected Republican and Democratic proposals to at least temporarily fund the federal government. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer has since urged President Donald Trump to meet with Democrats to strike a deal. The deadline for lawmakers to fund the government is Sept. 30.The market is coming off a solid weekly advance, with the three major indexes hitting all-time highs and the small-cap Russell 2000 posting its first record close since November 2021 on the heels of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates for the first time since December. Traders currently expect two more quarter-point rate cuts before year-end, per the CME Group's FedWatch tool."Unless something goes to hell in a handbasket in the next three months, basically the markets are telling you that they want to work their way higher and will do so by the end of the year," Stovall also said.This week, which marks the weakest historically for the S&P 500 based on Citadel Securities data, will bring the latest reading of the Fed's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures price index. Economists expect inflation to remain tame enough for the Fed to maintain its current stance on monetary policy.5 Hours AgoStocks finish at record highsAll the three major averages finished at record levels on Monday.The S&P 500 traded up 0.44% to finish at 6,693.75, and the Nasdaq Composite moved higher by 0.70% to end the session at 22,788.98. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also climbed 66.27 points, or 0.14%, to close at 46,381.54.— Sean Conlon6 Hours AgoThe market is facing 'elevated risk into early October,' according to BTIGWhile the market may be poised for even more upside through the end of 2025, there might be some near-term pressure in store, said Jonathan Krinsky, chief market technician at BTIG."SPX essentially up 10x since the March '09 [Global Financial Crisis] bottom at 666. It's likely too cute for it to top at exactly 6,666, and we suspect the year finishes higher than that," he wrote in a note dated Sunday. "Tactically, however, a consolidation makes sense into what is still an extremely weak seasonal stretch."Krinsky pointed to an adage on Wall Street known as "sell Rosh Hashanah, buy Yom Kippur," a strategy that says investors should sell into the Jewish new year and buy after the day of atonement. This year's period runs from Sept. 22 through Oct. 2."Overall, despite a market that seemingly can only go one way, we see elevated risk into early October, even if the overall trend continues higher into year-end," Krinsky added.— Sean Conlon7 Hours AgoCNBC Pro: The stock market usually doesn’t care about government shutdownsUS Capitol building is seen from Freedom Plaza on Sept. 7, 2025 in Washington, DC, United States.

"From a technical perspective, it is hard to argue with a bull market that is making new highs and powered by cyclical leadership," wrote Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist at LPL Financial. "However, building overbought conditions paired with diverging breadth suggest maybe this melt-up could be due for some cooling off — something we would consider a tactical opportunity to buy the dip," he added. — Sarah Min7 Hours AgoArgentine stocks soar after Bessent says U.S. ready to help countryArgentina's stock market soared Monday after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the U.S. would be able to help stabilize the peso, after allegations of corruption within President Javier Milei's circle and a big loss in a local election raised concern over one of Latin America's largest economies. Bessent said "all options are on the table" to help out Argentina, adding that the country is a "systemically important" ally in the region. The Global X MSCI Argentina ETF (ARGT) jumped 6.5%, on pace for its best day since April 9, when it popped 9%.

The first three days after this year's September rate cut, the 10-year Treasury yield increased 10 bp," the institutional equity strategist wrote, adding that "history is certainly rhyming so far.""A continued ramp up in yields is likely the biggest risk to this meaningful rally in risk assets since April," he continued.— Sean Conlon8 Hours AgoOracle, Apple, Teradyne and Molson Coors among the stocks moving in midday tradingCoors beer is displayed on a store shelf on February 13, 2024 in San Rafael, California. Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesCheck out the companies making the biggest moves midday:Oracle — The software company's stock rose more 4% after it named Clay Magouyrk, president of Oracle's cloud infrastructure business, and Mike Sicilia, preside of Oracle Industries, as chief executive officers.

A gigawatt is a measure of power that is increasingly being used to describe the biggest clusters of AI chips."This is monumental in size," CEO Jensen Huang told CNBC's Jon Fortt in an interview on Monday. Huang said that 10 gigawatts is about equivalent to between 4 million and 5 million Nvidia GPUs.More on the announcement here.— Pia Singh9 Hours AgoFed Governor Stephen Miran lays out why central bank should cut key interest rateNewly appointed Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran speaks at The Economic Club of New York in New York City, U.S., Sept. 22, 2025. Shannon Stapleton | ReutersLess than a week after taking his seat, Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran on Monday outlined the reasons why he thinks the central bank's benchmark interest rate is far too high and should be lowered aggressively.Changes in tax and immigration policy along with easing rental costs, deregulation and incoming revenue for tariffs are creating a different economic landscape that allow the Fed to cut its benchmark rate by nearly 2 percentage points from its current level, the central banker said in remarks before the Economic Club of New York."The Federal Reserve has been entrusted with the important goal of promoting price stability for the good of all American households and businesses, and I am committed to bringing inflation sustainably back to 2 percent," he said. "However, leaving policy restrictive by such a large degree brings significant risks for the Fed's employment mandate."Read more.— Jeff Cox9 Hours AgoApple shares rise on iPhone 17 demandwatch nowVIDEO1:5001:50Strong demand signals for iPhones push Apple into the greenMoney MoversShares of Apple moved more than 3% higher after the iPhone 17 lineup saw strong demand over the weekend.Globally, wait times for the newest model are generally higher than they were a year ago.

The firm upgraded the stock to overweight from equal weight and raised its price target to $25 per share from $17 a share, implying nearly 22% upside from Friday's close.Shares have been dragged down, in part, by a decline in industry-wide rig counts in the lower 48 states, known as L48, explained analyst Eddie Kim. The stock is down more than 34% year to date."We believe the trough in the L48 rig count is near, with stabilization through year-end and a modest recovery through 2026," he said in a note Monday.Plus, the stock has been hit by Helmerich and Payne 's acquisition of global drilling company KCA Deutag, which has significant operations in the Middle East, Kim wrote. Some 75% of KCA Deutag's Saudi rigs were suspended after the acquisition deal closed in January, he said."We believe the decline in the Saudi land rig count has all but played out with an opportunity to increase next year...opening the door for KCA Deutag rig suspensions to be lifted," Kim said.— Michelle Fox10 Hours AgoThere's ‘limited room’ for more interest rate cuts, St. Louis Fed President Musalem saysSt. Louis Federal Reserve President Alberto Musalem on Monday reiterated his support for last week's interest rate cut, but said he is wary about going much further.Speaking less than a week after the Federal Open Market Committee lowered its key overnight borrowing rate by a quarter percentage point, the central bank official advocated caution as he continues to worry about inflation.Musalem characterized the cut as "a precautionary move intended to support the labor market at full employment and against further weakening.""The stance of monetary policy now lies between modestly restrictive and neutral, which I view as appropriate," he added in prepared remarks for a speech to the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C.
