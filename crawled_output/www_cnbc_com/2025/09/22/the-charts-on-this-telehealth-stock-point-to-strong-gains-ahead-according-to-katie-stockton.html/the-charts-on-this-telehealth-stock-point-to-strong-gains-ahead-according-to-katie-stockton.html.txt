(HIMS) is now trading in an intermediate-term range above long-term support from the weekly cloud model (shaded area on the chart) and the 200-day (~40-week) moving average, both of which define the stock's cyclical uptrend. The uptrend remains healthy and is supported by positive long-term momentum, providing a bullish outlook through year-end. HIMS's long-term technical strength aligns with a bullish fundamental view from personal investing pro Austin Hankwitz , who notes: "Their stock is attractive in my view as annual revenue is expected to grow by +134% to $3.5B by 2027. Their total addressable market exceeds $25B+ per year, leaving plenty of runway for this innovative company." A rally off long-term support has turned the weekly stochastic oscillator higher, with room to run before reaching overbought territory. In range-bound environments, stochastics are especially useful, and the current setup suggests the rally could persist for at least a few more weeks. HIMS rallied late last week following a test of the 50-day moving average, sparking an uptick in the MACD histogram that points to continued short-term upside momentum. There are no signs of exhaustion in the near term, giving the stock room to advance toward the top of its range, in the $65–$66 zone. HIMS is also a long-term outperformer relative to the S & P 500 Index (SPX) . The ratio of HIMS to the SPX remains above its rising 200-day MA, and a recent upturn in weekly stochastics adds another positive catalyst. Notably, the previous two upturns in stochastics each resulted in a new relative high. HIMS has an adjusted beta of approximately 2.09, meaning the stock is about twice as volatile as the SPX on any given day. With high-beta positions, it is important to monitor nearby support levels to manage downside risk. For HIMS, the closest potential support lies at the 50-day MA near $51—over 12% below current levels. Investors with lower risk tolerance may want to consider a percentage-based stop-loss. —Katie Stockton with Will Tamplin Access research from Fairlead Strategies for free here . DISCLOSURES: None.
