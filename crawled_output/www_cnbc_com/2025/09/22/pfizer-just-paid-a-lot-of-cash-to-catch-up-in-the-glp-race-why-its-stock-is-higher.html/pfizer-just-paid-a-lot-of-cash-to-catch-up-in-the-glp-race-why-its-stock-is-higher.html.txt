See the full discussion above.) Pfizer is spending more than $7 billion to buy biotech Metsera to try to catch cup in the obesity drug market. Investors reacted by bidding shares of Pfizer higher in Monday morning trading, an atypical reaction to when a company is coughing up a big chunk of dough for an acquisition. "Getting into GLP land... it's kind of been the Holy Grail for everybody," said Tim Seymour of Seymour Asset Management in a special video for CNBC Pro (see above) . "I think's it's not surprising to see Pfizer rallying this morning because they had scrapped their own plans in GLP about five months ago." PFE 1D mountain Pfizer, 1 day "Pfizer, over the course of the last four years, has made major acquisitions, especially in oncology and places where they really have diversified the business and took $30 billion of Covid windfall and tried to invest in the future," the money manager added. With these recent acquisitions, Seymour is targeting $30 billion in additional revenue for Pfizer by 2030, that would represent about a 50% increase from revenue seen in the last 12 months Seymour also said the unique structure of the deal may be a reason for the positive reaction. Pfizer will not have to pay the full price tag unless certain clinical milestones are met by the Metsera oral and injectable weight loss treatments, including one that is only once a month. "They both can win," said Seymour on the deal. PFE YTD mountain Pfizer, YTD Pfizer was trading above $24 a share on Monday. The money manager noted that he bought it in the high $30s so that's obviously one reason he is cheering it on. Pfizer shares are off about 9% this year. Lastly, Seymour, who also manages the Amplify CWP International Enhanced Dividend Income ETF (IDVO) , likes the 7% dividend yield on the stock, which allows investors to get paid to wait for the comeback.
