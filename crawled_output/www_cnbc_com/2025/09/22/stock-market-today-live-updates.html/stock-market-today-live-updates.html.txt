The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average outperformed, rising 231 points, or 0.5%, and scoring a fresh all-time high during the trading day.The Dow's move was supported by a move higher in Boeing. The stock rose on the heels of President Donald Turmp praising Uzbekistan's president, Shavkat Mirziyoyev, for signing a "GREAT Deal" with the aerospace company that was worth more than $8 billion. Shares were also bolstered by talks between the U.S. and China of a "huge" Boeing deal.The three major averages closed at all-time highs on Monday — marking three straight winning sessions for the S&P 500 — and recorded fresh intraday records that day. Gains accelerated in the latter half of the trading session after Nvidia shares jumped nearly 4% higher on the back of an announcement from the chipmaker that it will invest $100 billion in OpenAI for the buildout of data centers.Questions remain on whether the AI trade can continue powering U.S. equities, particularly given the risks tied to elevated market valuations.Joe Davis, Vanguard chief global economist, noted that the explosive growth and adoption in AI, coupled with the Federal Reserve's latest interest rate cut, are the two notable factors that have led to higher multiples while "fundamentals are okay.""When you're a little bit at a richer levels, cracks are exposed to bad news," Davis said on CNBC's "Closing Bell: Overtime." "That's not to say that it's going to materialize, but I think we need to see acceleration and growth in the back half of the year or some progress on inflation, which remain stubborn. And I think either of those dimensions would help."The latest reading of the personal consumption expenditures price index — which is the Fed's preferred inflation measure — will be released Friday and is expected to give clues on the path of monetary policy for the remainder of the year.Investors are also watching the increasing chance of a government shutdown ahead of a Sept. 30 deadline after the Senate last week rejected Republican and Democratic proposals to at least temporarily fund the federal government. On Tuesday, Trump seemed to cancel a planned meeting this week with top Democrats in Congress, saying that no meeting with them regarding the shutdown "could possibly be productive."The stock market has historically brushed off concerns tied to government shutdowns, but this time around could be different as the economic backdrop heading into a shutdown is the weakest in more than two decades.27 Min AgoInvestors should prepare for higher-for-longer rates, says VanguardHigher medium- and long-term interest rates are here to stay, according to Vanguard.The Federal Reserve, which shapes the short end of the curve, is unlikely to ease substantially as it faces inflation above its 2% target for the fifth consecutive year, as well as a labor market that still remains in balance by historical standards, Kevin Khang, the firm's senior international economist, wrote in a note Thursday.In addition, long-term yields are impacted not just by Fed policy but by expectation about future rates and the premium investors expect from holding longer-duration bonds, Khang said. He sees those structural forces potentially working against a sustained drop in yields."For long-term investors, the real story is not whether the Fed cuts once or twice more in the remainder of 2025, but how they adapt to a world where structurally higher rates—and the forces behind them—are likely here to stay," Khang wrote.— Michelle Fox1 Hour AgoSilver hits highs going back to 2011Silver bars are stacked in the safe deposit boxes room of the Pro Aurum gold house in Munich, Germany, January 10, 2025.

"They are strongly recommending that women limit Tylenol use during pregnancy unless medically necessary. That's for instance, in cases of extremely high fever, that you feel you can't tough it out, you can't do it."Kenvue said in a statement Monday that it believes in "independent, sound science" that shows taking acetaminophen – the active ingredient in Tylenol – does not cause autism, adding that "we strongly disagree with any suggestion otherwise and are deeply concerned with the health risk this poses for expecting mothers."Stock Chart IconStock chart iconKVUE, 1-day— Sean Conlon, Annika Kim Constantino4 Hours AgoOECD raises U.S. and global growth forecastsThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development upgraded its global economic growth forecast on Tuesday, with many economies appearing more resilient than expected so far this year.The OECD now expects global growth of 3.2% this year, compared to the 2.9% expansion it had forecast in June. Expectations for 2026 were unchanged at 2.9%. This would mark a slowdown from the 3.3% growth seen in 2024.Growth expectations for the U.S. were also lifted, to 1.8% for 2025, compared to June's 1.6% estimate. This still marks a significant fall from 2024′s 2.8% growth, however. The organization forecasts 1.5% growth for the U.S. in 2026."Global growth was more resilient than anticipated in the first half of 2025, especially in many emerging-market economies," the OECD said in a new report.Read more.— Sophie Kiderlin4 Hours AgoU.S. ambassador to China says Trump-Xi meeting will likely occur next yearDavid Perdue, US Embassy in China, speaks at a press conference on Sept. 23, 2025.
