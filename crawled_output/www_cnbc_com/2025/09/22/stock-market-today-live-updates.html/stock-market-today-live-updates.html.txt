Michael M. Santiago | Getty ImagesThe S&P 500 took a pause from its recent gains on Tuesday as doubts about the sustainability of the artificial intelligence bull trend worried investors.The broad market index closed down 0.55% at 6,656.92 after reaching a new all-time intraday high earlier in the session and posting a record close on Monday. The Nasdaq Composite fell nearly 1% to settle at 22,573.47, with the losses led by AI names like Nvidia, Oracle and Amazon. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 88.76 points, or 0.19%, lower at 46,292.78.Nvidia shares fell 2.8% a day after the chipmaker announced a $100 billion investment in OpenAI, which boosted its stock and the whole equity market. Some investors were rethinking the deal between customer and supplier for its resemblance to events seen in the dot-com bubble. Investors also raised questions about whether there is enough energy to power the growth plans by the two marquee AI companies.Oracle, which is up more than 50% in three months because of an optimistic AI sales forecast, was off by 4.4%."While the initial reaction to Nvidia's investment in OpenAI was positive, investors quickly realized that Nvidia may be OpenAI's only option to get the capital it needs right now, an investor of last resort," said Gil Luria, head of technology research at D.A. Davidson. "OpenAI has overextended itself by making commitments well beyond its means, and Nvidia may have been the only equity investor willing to help."Stock Chart IconStock chart iconNvidia, 5 dayFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell furthered valuation concerns Tuesday, noting "equity prices are fairly highly valued." Powell also signaled that the rate-cutting path wasn't clear and that it was a "challenging situation."Still, the broader market kept losses to a minimum. The small-cap Russell 2000 managed to reach an all-time high during the session, riding enthusiasm about a Fed rate cut last week. However, it ultimately closed down 0.2%. Investors are awaiting Friday's release of the latest reading of the personal consumption expenditures price index, which is the Fed's preferred inflation measure.Traders were also watching an increasing chance of a government shutdown ahead of a Sept. 30 deadline after the Senate last week rejected Republican and Democratic proposals to at least temporarily fund the federal government. On Tuesday, Trump canceled a planned meeting this week with top Democrats in Congress, saying that no meeting "could possibly be productive."Tue, Sep 23 20254:08 PM EDTStocks close in the redThe three leading U.S. indexes finished Tuesday's session lower.The S&P 500 dropped 0.55% to 6,656.92, and the Nasdaq Composite declined 0.95%, ending at 22,573.47.

In addition, she said the cut "should be the first step" in an ongoing easing back to a neutral rate.Bowman advocated shifting the Fed's focus to the employment side of its dual mandate, as she believes tariffs will exact only a "short-lived" impact on inflation.— Jeff CoxTue, Sep 23 20251:44 PM EDTBoeing shares gain on Uzbekistan, China partnershipsShares of Boeing rose more than 1% on Tuesday after President Donald Trump in a Truth Social post praised Uzbekistan's president, Shavkat Mirziyoyev, for signing a "GREAT Deal" with the aerospace company.Boeing's agreement with Uzbekistan Airways was secured on Monday on the margins of the 80th United Nations General Assembly in New York City, Reuters reported."Worth over $8 Billion Dollars, Uzbekistan Airways is purchasing 22,787 Dreamliners.

"But you're right, by many measures, for example, equity prices are fairly highly valued."This comes as the three leading indexes closed at yet another record on Monday.

It raised its price target for the company to $160 from $147."While questions around U.S. drug pricing reform and potential pharma tariffs may impact how generalists view the broader biopharma space, we see JNJ at a point in its lifecycle where its product story and growth outlook can make it one of the preferred names in an otherwise challenged sector," Guggenheim analyst Vamil Divan said Monday in a note to clients.The price target hike comes as Johnson & Johnson clinches approvals for cancer treatments that could book big profits in the near future. The company's drug device and delivery systems, Inlexzo (TAR-200) and TAR-210, are poised to rake in more than $6 billion in sales, Guggenheim noted. Some J&J drugs, including Darzalex and Rybrevant/Lazcluze, also seem poised to gain traction in cancer treatment.The global market for pharmaceutical drugs is expected to grow more than 35% to $2.2 trillion by the end of 2029, according to global market research firm BCC Research.— Liz NapolitanoTue, Sep 23 202511:55 AM EDTAutoZone shares fall after earningsAutoZone shares fell more than 3% after the aftermarket auto parts retailer reported fiscal fourth quarter earnings and revenue that came in weaker than expectations.The company posted earnings of $48.71 per share, lower than the consensus estimate of $50.73 per share, according to FactSet.

He sees those structural forces potentially working against a sustained drop in yields."For long-term investors, the real story is not whether the Fed cuts once or twice more in the remainder of 2025, but how they adapt to a world where structurally higher rates—and the forces behind them—are likely here to stay," Khang wrote.— Michelle FoxTue, Sep 23 20259:58 AM EDTSilver hits highs going back to 2011Silver bars are stacked in the safe deposit boxes room of the Pro Aurum gold house in Munich, Germany, January 10, 2025.
