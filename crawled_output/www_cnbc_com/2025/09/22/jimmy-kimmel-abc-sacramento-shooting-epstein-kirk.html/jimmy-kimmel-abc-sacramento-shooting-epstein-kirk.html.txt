Jill Connelly | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesA California district attorney on Monday said that there is "circumstantial evidence" indicating that a former lobbyist accused of shooting at ABC's affiliate station in Sacramento was "politically motivated," and possibly spurred by the network's recent suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show.The evidence includes a book critical of President Donald Trump and a note expressing animus toward three of Trump's top law-enforcement officials, Sacramento DA Thien Ho told NBC News on Monday.That note also mentioned "Epstein," an apparent reference to the notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.The suspect, Anibal Hernandez Santana, faces both state and federal charges for Friday afternoon's shooting at KXTV ABC10."He chose a very particular target, and with the notes that he left behind and the target in place and the recent dismissal of the Jimmy Kimmel show, I think there's circumstantial evidence there to show that this was a politically motivated crime by this individual," Ho told NBC."He drove up to the scene, got out on foot, fired at the building, at the ABC news station, got back in his vehicle, and left the scene, where we later arrested him at his residence."Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump says Murdochs are potential TikTok deal partnersThe U.S. states with the most — and least — H-1B visa applications and renewalsTrump aide denies Kimmel suspended because of WH pressure despite Carr threatBig Tech firms scramble after Trump slaps $100,000 fee on H-1B visasFormer Disney CEO Eisner backs Jimmy Kimmel, blasts FCC 'intimidation' of ABCTed Cruz compares FCC Chair Carr to Mafia boss in Jimmy Kimmel warningsTrump says 'I'm winning' after judge tosses his $15 billion NY Times lawsuitTrump, Xi make progress on TikTok deal, but more work remains, White House says'Tonight, we are all Jimmy Kimmel,' Colbert says, calling Trump an 'autocrat'Trump floats pulling licenses if networks are 'against' him after Kimmel suspendedTrump hints at 'good news' coming on the Russia-Ukraine warTrump admin asks Supreme Court to allow firing of Fed Governor Lisa CookFCC Chair Carr says 'we're not done yet' after Jimmy Kimmel suspension by ABCThe attack, captured on surveillance video, occurred two days after the Disney subsidiary ABC suspended Kimmel after comments he made about the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.Police found three holes in a window of the lobby of the ABC affiliate that were consistent with damage from bullets, according to a federal criminal complaint.Hernandez Santana was arrested Friday night by Sacramento police.A day earlier, protestors had gathered outside the station to protest Kimmel's suspension.Portrait of American financier Jeffrey Epstein, left, and Donald Trump as they pose together at the Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, in 1997.Davidoff Studios Photography | Archive Photos | Getty ImagesInvestigators found a handgun at Hernandez Santana's home, along with "a note in his calendar that said something to the extent of this is the next scary thing to do," Ho told NBC.Investigators also "conducted another search and found some disturbing handwritten notes next to an anti-Trump book" and "a note that was written by the defendant" about "hiding Epstein and ignoring red flags."A note found at Santana's car said, "For hiding Epstein & ignoring red flags.
