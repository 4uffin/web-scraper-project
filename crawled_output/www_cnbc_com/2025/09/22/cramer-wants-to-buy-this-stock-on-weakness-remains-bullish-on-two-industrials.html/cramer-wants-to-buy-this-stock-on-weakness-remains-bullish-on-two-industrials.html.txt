Here's a recap of Monday's key moments. 1. Stocks are taking a breather on Monday after Friday's session saw the S & P 500 , Nasdaq , and Dow Jones Industrial Average score record highs. Much of the market's strength continues to come from the megacap tech cohort, including the Club's "own it, don't trade it" name, Apple . Shares of the iPhone maker are up more than 4% Monday on signs of robust demand for its latest iPhone 17. Elsewhere, Jim Cramer finds the weakness in Boeing stock as an opportunity to build on the Club's small position. Our strategy is, "Let's buy on the way down and get bigger," Jim said, adding he would buy if shares hit $210. The stock traded at about $212 midday and is still up nearly 20% this year, which is why Jim prefers to wait for a pullback before adding more. We bought Boeing shares on Friday. 2. Meanwhile, Microsoft was down slightly to $515 a piece after Melius Research analyst Ben Reitzes noted the stock has underperformed in the third quarter, ranking among "the worst of the elite eight" tech stocks, which includes Alphabet , Amazon , Apple, Broadcom , Meta , Microsoft, Netflix and Nvidia . However, Reitzes said the strength of Microsoft's cloud business Azure provides a long-term advantage. Jim takes an alternative view: "The stock is resting after a remarkable run." Microsoft stock is up 31% since its April lows of $355 per share. 3. Jim also highlighted overlooked industrials DuPont and Honeywell . Dupont shares gained nearly 1% Monday as the company moves closer to spinning off its electronics business into an independent company, Qnity Electronics, by Nov. 1. Jim said the stock could climb to $100 per share, a roughly 28% increase from its current price of $78. Honeywell is planning its own separation with its Advanced Materials spinoff scheduled for late 2025. "There's nothing wrong with Honeywell and there's nothing wrong with DuPont," Jim said, adding, "the split-ups have always worked." 4. Stocks covered in Monday's rapid fire at the end of the video were: T-Mobile , Pfizer , Oracle , Molson Coors , and Brinker International .
