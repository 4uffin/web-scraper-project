Nvidia and the power deal Another all-time high for this stock as Nvidia says it'll make a $100 billion investment in a partnership with OpenAI to "build and deploy at least 10 gigawatts of AI data centers." That's about ten times as many gigawatts as Doc Brown needed to send Marty McFly back to the future. (Thanks "Squawk Box" producer and podcast host Katie Kramer.) CNBC anchor and energy expert Brian Sullivan made the point today that it is not an easy feat to build that much power. It's about what New York City uses — all five boroughs — on a really hot day. Back in April, Nvidia was an $86 stock. It has more than doubled since then. Shares closed Monday at $183.61. The vista Vistra Vistra stock is back to new highs. Shares are now up 102% in the last 12 months. In September alone, the stock is up 15%. This was one of last year's top performing stocks in the S & P 500 as more investors piled into energy.

The Global X Data Center ETF (DTCR) was up 2.3% today and hit a new high. Digital Realty Trust was up 1.5% today. It is 12% from its high. The data center ETFs — Pacer Benchmark Data & Infrastructure Real Estate SCTR ETF (SRVR) and iShares U.S. Digital Infrastructure Real Estate ETF (IDGT) — are both near highs, both were up slightly on Monday. The financials The Bank of New York Mellon hit a new all-time high Monday. Shares are up almost 7% in a month. Citigroup is back to highs not seen since November of 2008. The stock is up 47% in 2025.

Shares are down nearly 8% in the last month. Year to date, the stock is up about 20%. The company "is gradually ramping up production and remains on track for these efforts," according to Cramer. He also called out "several big overseas purchases" of Boeing planes. To sum it all up he said: "The stock is too good to ignore."
