The company also delayed the launch of electric car models due to weak demand. Volkswagen, Porsche's biggest shareholder, also fell on the news, closing the session down 7.1%.Meanwhile, the Trump administration on Friday signed a surprise order to raise the so-called H-1B application fee to $100,000.The proclamation, which came into effect on Sunday, requires companies to pay the new six-figure fee to obtain the visas necessary for new employees entering the country. The move comes as part of an effort designed to protect American jobs and marks a further crackdown on immigration from the White House.India, for its part, has hit back at the $100,000 fee for applications to the H-1B visa program, saying the measure "is likely to have humanitarian consequences by way of the disruption caused for families."On the data front, a flash estimate for euro zone consumer confidence showed sentiment edged higher in September, rising 0.6 points to -14.9.Asia-Pacific stock markets traded mixed, as investors took in China's key lending rate decision.
