"We are fully staffed for all existing client requirements and will operate in a business-as-usual mode."JPMorgan's Toshi Jain also predicted that the impact, although modest, will be felt far beyond India's tech sector. The economist said that a decline in the number of new H1-B visa holders will likely lead to a reduction in remittances sent to India.Jain also sees a decline in Indian students choosing to go to the U.S. in the coming years, as the $100,000 visa fee may work as a new "tax" on finding a job in the U.S. post-education.Prashanth Prakash, partner at Indian venture capital firm Accel, echoed the view that it will not be easy for Indian going to universities in US and who look for a job there.He added, that Indian talent no longer heading to the U.S. could benefit the Indian startup ecosystem, which is dominated by tech companies.watch nowVIDEO8:5408:54H-1B visa fee increase is 'a positive' for Indian startups and VCs: AccelInside India"The recent H-1B uncertainty is a reminder that India must create opportunities where world-class talent can thrive without leaving home," said Apurv Agrawal, co-founder of Indian startup SquadStack.ai.Correction: This article has been updated to more accurately reflect the Citi Research notes on the impact of the H-1B fee on Indian IT margins.Subscribe to CNBC PROSubscribe to Investing ClubLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSelect Personal FinanceCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelSupply Chain ValuesClosed CaptioningDigital ProductsNews ReleasesInternshipsCorrectionsAbout CNBCAd ChoicesSite MapPodcastsCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?
