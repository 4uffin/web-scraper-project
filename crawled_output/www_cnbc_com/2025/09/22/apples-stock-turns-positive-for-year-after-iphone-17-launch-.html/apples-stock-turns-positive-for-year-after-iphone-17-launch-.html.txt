Apple is the last of the tech megacaps to turn positive.On Friday, Apple released new iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods models on Friday. The new iPhones, especially the midrange $999 iPhone Air, mark the first significant redesign in years, and analysts say early wait times suggest demand is strong."Our tracking of iPhone ship dates on Apple's own website, and various carrier websites, indicates that as of Sep 22nd, ship time (in days) for the iPhone 17 (18 days) are more extended vs last year's iPhone 16 (10 days)," Bank of America Securities analysts wrote in a note Monday.The company is also seeing strong demand in China, a key market for Apple, analysts say, based on pre-order times.Apple remains the laggard among the biggest tech companies so far in 2025, partially because it's spending far less on AI chips and data centers than its rivals. The company has also delayed a key improvement to its Siri assistant until 2026, raising concerns that it's falling behind companies such as Google and Microsoft in integrating the technology into its products.But Apple's new products include several AI features, such as its new AirPods Pro 3 headphones automatically translating spoken text, and its new Apple Watch models using machine learning to warn users about high blood pressure risks.WATCH: Apple iPhone 17 demand 'quite strong'watch nowVIDEO4:2804:28Apple iPhone 17 demand is 'quite strong,' says BofA's Wamsi MohanSquawk BoxSubscribe to CNBC PROSubscribe to Investing ClubLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSelect Personal FinanceCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelSupply Chain ValuesClosed CaptioningDigital ProductsNews ReleasesInternshipsCorrectionsAbout CNBCAd ChoicesSite MapPodcastsCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?
