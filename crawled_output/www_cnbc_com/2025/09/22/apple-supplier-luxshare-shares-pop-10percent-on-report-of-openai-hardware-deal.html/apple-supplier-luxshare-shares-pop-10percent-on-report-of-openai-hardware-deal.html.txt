Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesShenzhen-listed Luxshare saw its shares jump about 10% on Monday, following a report that the Chinese device assembler had signed a deal with OpenAI to produce a consumer AI device. The company, which is also a supplier for Apple, is already developing a prototype of the device using ChatGPT large language models, The Information reported Friday, citing people familiar with the matter.One source said that one of the products OpenAI has talked to suppliers about making would resemble a smart speaker without a display, which could put it in competition with Apple devices using Siri, with the company targeting late 2026 or early 2027 for its first device launches.Luxshare's 10% jump brought its year-to-date gains to about 50%. Most stocks on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange aren't allowed to trade up or down more than 10% in a single day, relative to the previous day's closing price. The company is also reportedly considering a secondary listing in Hong Kong this year. Luxshare and OpenAI did not immediately respond to CNBC's requests for comment. watch nowVIDEO2:3502:35OpenAI CEO Sam Altman on path to profitability: Willing to run at a loss to focus on growthSquawk BoxOpenAI has long been signaling a desire to push into dedicated AI devices, presenting a potential challenge to Apple and its iPhone. As part of these plans, The Information reported that OpenAI has been poaching staff from Apple to join its hardware division, now led by ex-Apple executive Tang Tan.Earlier this year, the AI company, headed by Sam Altman, partnered with former Apple designer Jony Ive after buying his hardware startup, io Products, in a $6.4 billion deal. Ive is responsible for designing many of Apple's most iconic products, including the iPhone, iPad and MacBook Air.An OpenAI partnership with Luxshare would bring Apple's longtime supplier — responsible for assembling items like the AirPods and Vision Pro — into the AI comapny's orbit.The AI company has also approached China-based Goertek, which also assembles AirPods, HomePods and Apple Watches, to provide components, including speaker modules, for its planned devices, according to the Information report.OpenAI has been pushing deeper into hardware, hiring the former head of Meta's Orion augmented reality glasses initiative in November to lead its robotics and consumer hardware efforts.In the same month, OpenAI invested in robot startup Physical Intelligence, which focuses on "bringing general-purpose AI into the physical world," according to its website.Subscribe to CNBC PROSubscribe to Investing ClubLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSelect Personal FinanceCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelSupply Chain ValuesClosed CaptioningDigital ProductsNews ReleasesInternshipsCorrectionsAbout CNBCAd ChoicesSite MapPodcastsCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?
