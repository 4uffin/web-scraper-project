NYSEThe S&P 500 fell on Wednesday as artificial intelligence giants Nvidia and Oracle came under pressure for a second day.The broad market index dropped 0.28% to end at 6,637.97, while the Nasdaq Composite pulled back 0.34% to settle at 22,497.86. The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 171.50 points, or 0.37%, to finish at 46,121.28.Nvidia slid almost 1%, continuing its declines from Tuesday as heightened fears about the potentially circular nature of the AI industry drew investor skepticism. Earlier this week, the chipmaker announced a $100 billion partnership with OpenAI. Fellow leading AI player Oracle also fell for a second straight day, losing nearly 2% Wednesday.The Nasdaq's losses for the day were narrowed heading into the close as Intel surged more than 6% after Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter, reported that the chipmaker is seeking an investment from Apple. That comes just days after Nvidia said it would invest $5 billion in the company.Beyond those names, shares of Micron Technology moved lower by almost 3% as the company's earnings and forecast weren't strong enough to impress investors, signaling that confidence in the AI trade is still in question.The S&P 500 closed in the red on Tuesday, snapping a three-day winning streak, on those AI trade worries. The index had reached a new all-time intraday high earlier in the session and posted a record close Monday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq dipped as well, bogged down by Nvidia.Traders could be profit-taking amid elevated market valuations, which Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell called out at a Tuesday press conference."Tech is probably a little bit extended," Jay Hatfield, CEO of Infrastructure Capital Advisors, said to CNBC, adding that "there's no real reason to be bullish." "I would not say, 'Oh, nobody's going to use AI and the world is coming to an end,' but it's clearly valuation.""This might go on for a couple days," he also said, noting seasonal weakness. As it stands, the S&P 500 is still almost 3% higher on the month, much more than September's average decline of 4.2% in the past five years.Traders are cautious before jobless claims data Thursday and PCE inflation data Friday.

GOOGL has deserved its rally, but Microsoft still deserves a meaningful premium," Reitzes said in a note to clients Monday.Alphabet's 60-day outperformance relative to Microsoft last week also reached its highest level since January 2006, a CNBC data analysis showed.
