Unlike most central banks, it manages monetary policy by guiding the Singapore dollar within an undisclosed band against a basket of trading-partner currencies, rather than adjusting interest rates.Gilbert added that this is even more important, with the boost from front-loaded exports fading. "Recent export data, including an abrupt fall in non-oil domestic exports, suggest the payback from front-loading is already underway, adding to downside risks [for growth]"Singapore's non-oil domestic exports plunged 11.3% year-on-year in August, a sharp reversal from the 1% rise expected from a Reuters poll of economists.Subscribe to CNBC PROSubscribe to Investing ClubLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSelect Personal FinanceCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelSupply Chain ValuesClosed CaptioningDigital ProductsNews ReleasesInternshipsCorrectionsAbout CNBCAd ChoicesSite MapPodcastsCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?
