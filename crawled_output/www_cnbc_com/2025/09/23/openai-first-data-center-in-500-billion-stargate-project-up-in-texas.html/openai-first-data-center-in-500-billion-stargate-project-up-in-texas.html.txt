Over $2 trillion in AI infrastructure has been planned around the world, according to an HSBC estimate this week.OpenAI is leading the way.In addition to the $500 billion Stargate project, the startup on Monday announced an equity investment deal with Nvidia that will add an estimated $500 billion worth of data centers in the coming years. Since 2019, Microsoft has invested billions of dollars in OpenAI, providing loads of access to Azure credits. Additionally, OpenAI contracts with smaller cloud companies for additional compute capacity and help operating its infrastructure.One building on the Abilene site is operational while another is nearly complete. The campus has the potential to ultimately scale past a gigawatt of capacity, OpenAI finance chief Sarah Friar told CNBC. That would be enough electricity to power about 750,000 U.S. homes.The data center construction plans are important enough that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang personally engaged in last-minute negotiations with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman over the weekend to get in on the action, CNBC reported earlier on Tuesday."People are starting to recognize just the sheer scale that will be required," Friar said. "We're just getting going here in Abilene, Texas, but you'll see this all around the United States and beyond."The scale of the project's construction was necessary to supply the amount of compute required to operate OpenAI's models, Friar said."What we see today is a massive compute crunch," she said. "There's not enough compute to do all the things that AI can do."watch nowVIDEO3:2103:21OpenAI's Sarah Friar: 'Full ecosystem' needs to come together to address compute crunchTechCheckA bold bet on AI infrastructureOpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank, which is helping fund the project, announced on Tuesday five additional Stargate sites across Texas, New Mexico, Ohio and an additional unnamed site in the Midwest. That brings the size of the initiative to nearly 7 gigawatts and more than $400 billion of investment over the next three years, which includes an existing $300 billion agreement between OpenAI and Oracle.While companies like Oracle are helping fund the data center construction, OpenAI will ultimately be the one to pay for the computing capacity as an operating expense, Friar said. Although Nvidia is putting in equity to jumpstart the project, Friar said the chipmaker will get paid for all graphics processing units (GPUs) that it provides as those chips get deployed.Friar said OpenAI will generate $13 billion in revenue this year, and that the company plans to help pay for the construction using its own cash flow and debt financing.The Stargate name will refer to all OpenAI infrastructure projects going forward, CNBC reported this week. Together with CoreWeave and other partners, the companies say they are ahead of schedule to meet their full 10-gigawatt commitment by the end of 2025.Friar told CNBC the shovels going into the ground today are laying foundations for compute that won't come online until 2026, starting with Nvidia next-generation Vera Rubin chips.Data center buildings are under construction during a tour of the OpenAI data center in Abilene, Texas, U.S., Sept. 23, 2025. Shelby Tauber | Reuters"No one in the history of man built data centers this fast," Friar said, adding that the entire ecosystem has to work together to meet demand.Critics have questioned the circular funding behind Stargate -- OpenAI committing hundreds of billions of dollars to projects while suppliers like Nvidia are also investing directly into those same buildouts.Friar said history shows that technology booms require bold infrastructure bets."When the internet was getting started, people kept feeling like, 'Oh, we're over-building, there's too much,'" Friar said. "Look where we are today, right?"The project also carries political weight. OpenAI and Oracle first unveiled Stargate alongside President Donald Trump at the White House in January. Friar called Trump "the president of this AI era," pointing to Washington's role in framing the technology as both an economic engine and a national security priority. Trump was briefed on the Nvidia investment into OpenAI during a state visit to the U.K. earlier this month.Oracle says the project will employ more than 6,000 construction workers daily and deliver nearly 1,700 long-term jobs.In a paper published Tuesday about OpenAI's infrastructure plans, the company wrote that its data center buildout could help reshape the American power grid with new technologies and help the U.S. exert global influence.-- CNBC's Kif Leswing contributed to this story.WATCH: OpenAI CFO: Need partners like Oracle and Microsoft to meet demandwatch nowVIDEO2:0602:06OpenAI CFO: Need partners like Oracle and Microsoft to meet demandTechCheckMore In AI EffectMicrosoft adds Anthropic AI model to Copilot assistant, diversifying from OpenAIJordan NovetSam Altman on worries about OpenAI's $850 billion in planned buildouts: 'I totally get that'MacKenzie SigalosAltman, Huang and the last-minute negotiations that sealed the $100 billion OpenAI-Nvidia dealMacKenzie SigalosRead MoreSubscribe to CNBC PROSubscribe to Investing ClubLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSelect Personal FinanceCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelSupply Chain ValuesClosed CaptioningDigital ProductsNews ReleasesInternshipsCorrectionsAbout CNBCAd ChoicesSite MapPodcastsCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?
