In the quality of life ranking, Panama also ranked No. 3 and 35% of those surveyed there say they plan to stay in the country forever."It has a perfect mix of decent infrastructure at affordable prices in combination with a pleasant climate and most importantly, a culture that's open, friendly and easy to integrate with," Kathrin Chudoba, Chief Marketing Officer at InterNations, tells CNBC Make It.Panama ranked as the best country for expats for a second year in a row.Nico De Pasquale Photography | Digitalvision | Getty ImagesPanama ranking at the very top of the list is part of an ongoing trend, Chudoba says. People looking to live and work abroad are having positive experiences in Asian and Latin American countries."This [also] confirms a trend that we have observed in the past three years or so and that's the importance of personal finance amongst expats," she adds. "It clearly shows that expats haven't been left untouched by the effects of economic uncertainty and high inflation."Before moving to Panama, 26% of expats reported having no concerns, compared to 16% globally. The survey also found that for those expats who aren't retired, the country offers an amazing experience working abroad, ranking No. 1 in the topical category.Panama has long been known as an affordable destination for expats. For about $800 to $1,500 per month, you can live comfortably in small towns, villages and farming communities, according to the Global Citizen Solutions. Those looking to live in Panama City, the capital of Panama, will require a higher monthly budget of up to $2,500. The overall cost of living in Panama for a single person is 36.3% lower than in the U.S.Like other countries, Panama offers expats several different visa options, including the Friendly Nations visa, the Pensionado ("Pensioner" in English) Program, and the Remote Worker visa.Want to be your own boss? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Start A Business: For First-Time Founders.
