Terms of the agreement were not disclosed.Brady's business partner Alex Spiro will also join Aescape, as a strategic advisor. They will support both product development and Aescape's growth into capital markets, the company said.Brady, a 7-time Super Bowl champion, played in the NFL until age 45 and is arguably one of the best quarterbacks to ever play in the league. He attributes much of his success and longevity to his training and recovery efforts. Aescape will work with the MVP to integrate his daily routines into its personalized robotics platform."After 23 years playing professionally, there's no way I could have accomplished what I did professionally without all the massage work and recovery protocols," Brady told CNBC. "The reason why I'm still able to do what I love to do is because of the bodywork, the care that I received on a daily and weekly basis, and I want to try to make that available for everybody."Aescape is a New York-based robotics company with over 100 locations in North America.AescapeAescape was founded in 2017 by entrepreneur Eric Litman. The New York-based company uses AI technology to provide a fully automated and customizable massage. It has more than 100 locations and has delivered more than 25,000 massages using its automated robots.Aescape's partners include high-end fitness company Equinox and select Four Seasons, Marriott, and Ritz-Carlton hotel properties across North America. The company is backed by $130 million in funding from investors that include Valor Siren Ventures, Valor Equity Partners, BroadLight Capital, Crosslink Capital and AlleyCorp."Our bodies are these machines that need significant ongoing maintenance, and with better maintenance and better care, they can last substantially longer," said Litman, Aescape's CEO.Litman said he has seen firsthand the growth of massages in consumers' habits. He said Aescape is an attractive option for many customers because it's lower in cost (starting around $30 per service), you don't have to shower before or after a session, and treatments can be shorter than a traditional massage.For Spiro, an investor and attorney, the focus is on Aescape's scale and growth plan — whether it's in the football training room, internationally or one day getting massage robots into people's homes."As the machine's price comes down and this company becomes better known, it will democratize access so that everyday people can use it, get their backs better, return to work, and allow us to do something really good for society," he said.watch nowVIDEO2:1402:14Tom Brady signs deal with AescapeSquawk BoxGet the CNBC Sport newsletter directly to your inboxThe CNBC Sport newsletter with Alex Sherman brings you the biggest news and exclusive interviews from the worlds of sports business and media, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.More In CNBC SportRobert Kraft agrees to sell New England Patriots minority stake in deal that values team at $9BMichael OzanianCNBC Sport: NFL’s Roger Goodell on Tom Brady controversy; and a YouTube-NBC collision courseAlex ShermanWalmart teams up with Spain's La Liga, furthering the retailer's investment in soccerLuke FountainRead MoreSubscribe to CNBC PROSubscribe to Investing ClubLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSelect Personal FinanceCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelSupply Chain ValuesClosed CaptioningDigital ProductsNews ReleasesInternshipsCorrectionsAbout CNBCAd ChoicesSite MapPodcastsCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?
