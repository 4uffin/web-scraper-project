On Monday, Britain's health regulator said that it was safe to use."The evidence remains inconsistent," WHO spokesperson Tarik Jašarević told a Geneva press briefing when asked about a possible link between paracetamol use in pregnancy and autism.He cited unspecified studies that pointed to a possible link but said that this was not confirmed by subsequent research. "This lack of replicability really calls for caution in drawing casual conclusions," he said.In a highly unusual press conference at the White House on Monday, Trump delivered medical advice to pregnant women and parents of young children, repeatedly telling them not to use or administer the painkiller and suggesting that common vaccines not be taken together or so early in a child's life.The advice from Trump goes against that of medical societies, which have cited data from numerous studies showing that acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, plays a safe role in the well-being of pregnant women.Asked to elaborate further on Trump's remarks, Jašarević added that vaccines did not cause autism and affirmed their life-saving qualities. "This is something that science has proven, and these things should not be really questioned," he added.Subscribe to CNBC PROSubscribe to Investing ClubLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSelect Personal FinanceCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelSupply Chain ValuesClosed CaptioningDigital ProductsNews ReleasesInternshipsCorrectionsAbout CNBCAd ChoicesSite MapPodcastsCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?
