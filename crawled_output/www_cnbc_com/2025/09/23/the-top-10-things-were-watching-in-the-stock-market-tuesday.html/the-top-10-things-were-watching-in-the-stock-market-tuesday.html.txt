Belvedere@Matt_BelvedereJeff Marks@jeffmarkscnbcOur top 10 things to watch Tuesday, Sept. 23 — Matthew J. Belvedere wrote this morning's newsletter with the help of Jeff Marks. 1. The S & P 500 was relatively flat Tuesday morning following a three-session winning streak. The index closed at a record high Monday, and so did the Nasdaq as tech stocks surged on Club holding Nvidia's gains after its OpenAI announcement . Looking ahead , Club name Costco reports earnings after Thursday's close, and the Federal Reserve's favorite inflation gauge is out Friday morning. 2. Nvidia's $100 billion investment to help OpenAI build AI data centers followed one-on-one negotiation s between the CEOs of the two companies. Jim Cramer said he spoke to Nvidia's Jensen Huang after the deal was announced yesterday. "Jensen told me that Sam was the first to recognize what could be done with this platform. Only fitting that they get together to go to the next level, where the machines can reason better than we can." Jim's reference to Sam is Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI. 3. Nvidia shares were modestly lower Tuesday morning after closing at a record high Monday. Evercore ISI raised its Nvidia price target to $225 from $214 and maintained its outperform buy rating. The analysts said Street earnings estimates for Nvidia are too low, given the OpenAI partnership and other recently announced deals. 4. It's not just Nvidia that will benefit from the OpenAI deal to build AI data centers. Club stocks GE Vernova and Eaton are key beneficiaries of the growing need for more energy to support the massive amount of computing power set to come online over the next decade. Both stocks also rallied Monday. 5. Jefferies downgraded Vistra to a hold from a buy. The analysts said: "With Comanche nuke deal delayed vs our expectations and shares pricing-in significant upside, we look for a pull-back for better risk/reward." The analysts also lowered their price target on Vistra to $230 from $241. 6. Shares of Danish renewables giant Orsted jumped Tuesday, after a U.S. judge ruled that the embattled firm can resume construction of an offshore wind farm that was halted by the Trump administration. 7. Wells Fargo upgraded CoreWeave , which rents Nvidia chip computing power, to a buy from hold. The analysts also raised their price target to $170 per share from $105. They see CoreWeave benefiting from hyperscaler spending and Nvidia's agreement to buy all excess capacity through 2032. Wells described the Nvidia part as a "blank check" for more than six years. 8. Opening arguments are set to begin Tuesday's in the FTC's lawsuit against Amazon for allegedly deceiving tens of millions of customers into signing up for Prime and thwarting their attempts to cancel it. Amazon has denied any wrongdoing. 9. Citi analysts said that Meta Platforms ' smart glasses could reach a "tipping point" next year following last week's Meta Connect event. Meta remains a top pick at Citi with a buy rating and $915 price target. 10. U.S. lawmakers talked about a Boeing deal with China's top leaders during a visit to Beijing, Democratic Rep. Adam Smith from the state of Washington, announced at a news conference Tuesday. Boeing has a major manufacturing presence in Washington. We started a position in Boeing earlier this month on the thesis that the stock will benefit from President Donald Trump 's trade policies.
