"Look, there are always going to be challenges. You have to, kind of, stay resilient. I think resilience is a really important quality, and I kind of dig deep and move on, always."Weir's first month as CEO coincided with President Donald Trump slamming "reciprocal" tariffs on over 180 countries on April 2, with levies hitting regions that are key manufacturing bases for the fashion industry.VIDEO6:2606:26Why fashion matters for Britain: BFC CEO Laura WeirSquawk Box EuropeThis includes China, where brands like Prada and Zara outsource production, Vietnam, where Nike produces most of its footwear, and Pakistan, which is key in producing denim items. Meanwhile, the EU —which accounts for over 70% of the global luxury goods market — is also facing duties.  David Pemsel, chairman of the British Fashion Council, said in April that the tariffs "pose a serious concern for the community, forcing many to choose between price hikes and tighter margins." He said the council was working with the U.K. Department of Business and Trade to advocate for tariff-free entry for U.K. fashion goods into the U.S. market.Weir described the tariffs as "very challenging," but struck an optimistic tone, highlighting the importance of relationships with American counterparts."I hope that we can find a way through working with our American counterparts, to try and explain the impact and the real terms challenge that that puts on the industry," she said."I mean, in terms of our designers who are already challenged, it can really affect their ability to trade and be commercially successful and ultimately viable. So we're working hard at the BFC to help our American counterparts really understand the true impact of their decisions."In fact, a recent global survey of over 1,000 business leaders across a variety of sectors by advisory platform Consulting.us found that over 60% believe resilience is the No. 1 most important quality for company bosses, as they navigate tariffs and economic uncertainty.Good leaders listenWhen asked to describe her leadership style, Weir emphasized the importance of listening to those around her."I think it's really important as a modern leader and a CEO to be open to conversation and dialog. So I think rightly identifying the challenges that we're facing and also some of the optimistic positives," she said."And I'm really open for conversation with our patrons, with our community, with the designers, with politicians, and I want to kind of build those relationships and approach it in a very inclusive way."Some of the most famous business leaders — from Amazon CEO Andy Jassy to Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi — have also described listening and conversing with employees on the ground as a key leadership quality.Jassy, for example, said the best leaders acknowledge diverse viewpoints that differ from their own and can admit when their ideas are wrong.A boss' job is often to get "the right people in a room" to give their feedback and ideas, so they can listen and weigh the potential options, he saidKhosrowshahi, who moonlighted as an Uber driver to learn about and improve the driver experience, said listening is one of the most important skills he learned from his mentor."There are all kinds of courses on executive leadership, and I still haven't seen a course on listening," he said. "Yet the common theme I've seen in life and with executives that are very high up on the ladder is that the higher you go in a company, the less you actually know about what's really happening on the ground."Stay in the loopGet Make It newsletters delivered to your inboxSign UpAbout UsLearn more about the world of CNBC Make ItLearn MoreFollow UsCNBC.COMJoin the CNBC Panel© 2025 CNBC LLC.
