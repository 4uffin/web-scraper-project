Wealth management accounted for nearly half of Morgan Stanley's total revenue last year, making it more reliant on the industry than its other big bank peers.The move is the latest sign of crypto adoption by financial incumbents. In an earlier wave about four years ago, banks including Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs began offering bitcoin funds to their wealthy clients. That gave clients exposure to the asset class though crypto firms including Galaxy Digital that managed the funds.But what Morgan Stanley is doing now is preparing to offer direct ownership of crypto, which cuts out some third-party management fees and comes with greater risks. Morgan Stanley will first offer bitcoin, ether and solana trading, according to Bloomberg News.Morgan Stanley is preparing for a future in which wealthy clients expect to see traditional and digital assets managed in the same environment, Finn said in the memo.The bank is working on a wallet that will allow it to be the custodian for clients' digital assets, a key part of its overall strategy, he said."Offering clients the ability to trade crypto is the tip of the iceberg," Finn said.Tokenized assetsThe bank expects to help clients hold not just crypto, but also tokenized versions of traditional financial assets, according to the memo.Tokenization — or creating a digital representation of assets including cash, stocks, bonds and real estate on a blockchain — will "significantly disrupt" the wealth management industry, Finn said."Tokenized substitutes for cash begin paying interest as soon as it hits the wallet," Finn said. "The rest of the asset classes will follow suit in seeking this efficiency.""We see immense power in the cryptocurrency space, not just with crypto as an investment for our clients, but also around DLT and tokenization more broadly," he said, using the acronym for distributed ledger technology, the concept underpinning blockchain.Don’t miss these insights from CNBC PROTrump's $100,000 visa plan could hit these companies the hardestGoldman Sachs raises S&P 500 target for year-endChina isn't begging for Nvidia anymore.
