Here's a recap of Wednesday's key moments. 1. The S & P 500 dropped Wednesday as bond yields continued to climb. "We've gotta stay front and center with rates. After the Fed cut, we wanted to see long-term rates go down, [both] the 30-year and the 10-year [Treasury yields]," Jim Cramer said during our Morning Meeting. "It's not happening," he added, referencing Club stock Home Depot , which has dipped as bond yields moved higher since last Wednesday's 25-basis-point Federal Reserve interest rate cut. Home Depot is one of the companies that benefits from a lower rate environment. Jim was hopeful that, unlike last September, this year's Fed cut would send yields down. "That's the undercurrent for much of the market," Jim said. 2. " Boeing is my favorite stock in our Charitable Trust," said Jim. The Trust porfolio is what we use for the Club. The commentary follows the latest push from U.S. lawmakers to get China to order Boeing aircraft as part of a broader trade deal between the two nations. The plane maker also partnered with Palantir for AI adoption in its defense and space business. Boeing's stock has fallen roughly 10% from recent highs. "We like that type of pullback to scale into a position. That's what we've been doing," said Jeff Marks, director of portfolio analysis for the Club. "If it continues to go down, we'll probably keep buying it," Jeff added. Next, the Club wants to see Boeing get the FAA green light to boost production. 3. Nvidia shares dipped again Wednesday, two days after news of its massive $100 billion commitment to OpenAI. The partnership has raised concerns about an AI bubble and circular funding, a form of vendor financing in which the artificial intelligence giant provides capital for customers to buy its chips. " I don't care for vendor financing because what that says is your customers don't have the money to buy it. However, the stuff is so expensive," Jim said, pointing to Oracle 's push to raise $15 billion from corporate bond sales to fund its artificial intelligence investments. 4 . Stocks covered in Wednesday's rapid fire at the end of the video were: ARM Holdings , PayPal , General Motors , Adobe, and ServiceNow . (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long BA, NVDA.
