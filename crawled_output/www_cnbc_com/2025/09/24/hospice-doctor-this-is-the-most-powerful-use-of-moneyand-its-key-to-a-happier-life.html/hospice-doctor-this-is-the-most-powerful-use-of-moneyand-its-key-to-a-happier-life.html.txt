Dr. Jordan Grumet, hospice doctor and author of "The Purpose Code," says the answer isn't so clear cut."I take care of people at the end of life, and I've seen people from every economic class," Grumet tells CNBC Make It.When it comes to happiness, "I'll tell you, money doesn't seem to correlate. It really doesn't. I've seen really, really happy poor people, and I've seen really, really miserable rich people."Grumet has found a correlation that really stands out among the happiest people he's helped transition at the end of their lives. In a recent article published in Psychology Today, he called it the "most overlooked and most powerful use of money."Here is the No. 1 way you can spend your money for a happier life, according to Grumet: It's "something I think we all can do on any budget."The one way money can actually buy happiness, according to GrumetInvesting in your personal growth"The happiest people I see are the ones who don't have regrets, and the ones who don't have regrets put the energy, courage and time into becoming who they wanted to be, whether they spent money on it or not," Grumet says."What I think is the most enduring type of spending is when we spend on becoming a better version of ourselves. That's when we actually put money into doing things that deeply resonate with us, that connect to who we want to be as a person."Some examples of investing in personal growth are spending money on a coach who can help you become a stronger writer or buying good running shoes because you like to run.Grumet believes that spending money on opportunities that allow you to grow as a person leads to lasting happiness because it helps you develop meaningful connections. Having close, personal relationships that you value is the No. 1 way to improve happiness, according to a decades-long Harvard study."You tend to connect to other people, and you tend to become part of communities. I call them communities of internal purpose," Grumet says.And investing in yourself doesn't have to be expensive, he explains."If you want to be an explorer, you could spend $10,000 or $15,000 on planning a trip to Machu Picchu. But if that's really what you want, to become that person who explores more, there's tons of ways to do that, even locally. You could join a local hikers group or a restaurant tour," Grumet says."Just because you don't have a lot of money doesn't mean that the little bit you do spend [can't be] on something that's deeply important to you, that lights you up. That spending actually gives you a lot of happiness."There are 2 ways of spending that won't give you lasting happiness, he says1. Spending money on experiencesWhile it doesn't provide happiness that's as long-lasting as investing in yourself, spending on experiences is still a good way to increase your chances of feeling happier."Let's say, going on a trip. We spend money to schedule the trip [and] we get all that anticipation," he says."Then we go on the trip itself, and we get all that joy when we're on that trip. We get all the memories, which I think also gives us joy going into the future."Still, spending money on experiences has its limitations. Once you feel excitement from one experience, you're more likely to want to try a new experience that brings you even more joy.That's what is called the hedonic treadmill, "where we're chasing more and more experiences, trying to get the most juice out of the squeeze, but we kind of adapt," Grumet says."For instance, going to Europe would be really exciting the first time you do it. The second time, it's a little less exciting. If you're doing it multiple times a year, it even becomes less exciting than that."2. Buying thingsCertain things are necessary to buy like food and water. But when it comes to purchasing things like clothes or jewelry, the happiness that follows usually wanes quickly, Grumet says."There's nothing wrong with buying something you enjoy, but that's probably not going to give you lasting happiness," he says. "What I call the cheapest version of spending is spending on a thing."Similar to spending on experiences, buying things can lead to hedonic adaptation, where you're searching for the next best thing to quickly boost your dopamine until the sparks of joy level out.The caveat to this form of spending is when you buy things for other people, he notes. "Sometimes when we buy a thing for another person, and we see the joy in their face, that's probably a little bit more durable and a little bit lasting."Want to be your own boss? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Start A Business: For First-Time Founders.
