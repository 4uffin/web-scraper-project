How to get long with optionsPublished Wed, Sep 24 20258:12 AM EDTTony Zhang@OptionsPlayWATCH LIVEFortinet continues to stand out in the cybersecurity space for its profitability leadership and differentiated push into AI-powered security solutions. With more than 500 AI-related patents and deep integration of FortiAI across its Security Fabric platform, the company is positioned at the forefront of defending against AI-enhanced cyber threats. The 2025 Fortinet Global Threat Landscape Report highlights the growing use of automation by cybercriminals, and Fortinet's AI-driven product suite directly addresses this need, creating meaningful barriers to entry for competitors. Recognition in the 2025 Gartner Magic Quadrant for SASE Platforms further validates Fortinet's leadership and suggests durable competitive advantages. For investors, the combination of profitability, attractive valuation relative to peers, and long-term growth drivers in AI security make FTNT an attractive candidate. Trade Timing & Outlook FTNT recently broke out above its $80 resistance level, with the breakout supported by strong relative performance versus the S & P 500. This breakout suggests potential follow-through toward the $95 level to fill the gap. Fundamentals Relative to peers, FTNT trades at a modest premium on forward P/E multiples, but its profitability metrics far exceed industry averages, justifying upside potential. Forward PE Ratio: 30x vs. Industry 24x Expected EPS Growth: 10% vs. 12% Expected Revenue Growth: 12% vs. 9% Net Margins: 31% vs. 9% Bullish Thesis AI-driven differentiation: Over 500 AI-related patents filed across Security Fabric accelerates autonomous threat detection and improves security operations. Competitive validation: Recognized as a Leader in Gartner's 2025 Magic Quadrant for SASE Platforms, highlights credibility and customer adoption.

Strategic moat: AI and automation create long-term barriers for competitors, positioning Fortinet for sustainable growth in enterprise security budgets.
