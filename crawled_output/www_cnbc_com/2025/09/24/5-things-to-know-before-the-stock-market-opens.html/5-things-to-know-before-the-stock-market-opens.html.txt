Taking stockFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said that cooling in the labor market prompted the central bank to cut interest rates last week. Speaking to business leaders in Rhode Island yesterday, he warned that there's a "challenging situation" ahead as the Fed tries to balance its goals of high employment and tame inflation.Here's what to know:Powell said there's "no risk-free path" in comments made nearly one week after the Fed lowered rates for the first time in 2025.He also said that equity prices are "fairly highly valued," but added that this is "not a time of elevated financial stability risks."Stocks took a leg down following Powell's comments and ended yesterday's session in the red.

Just take a look at two of the most recent corporate infrastructure investments.OpenAI's flagship site for the $500 billion Stargate program opened in Abilene, a city about 180 miles west of Dallas. It's only one of OpenAI's recent buildout announcements, which total about $850 billion in spending, CNBC's MacKenzie Sigalos reports. CEO Sam Altman rejected the notion that his company's spending spree is concerning: "People are worried. I totally get that. I think that's a very natural thing," Altman told CNBC.

Meanwhile, Y Combinator's Garry Tan equated the fee to "$100K toll booths," writing on social media that "it kneecaps startups."Get Morning Squawk directly in your inboxCNBC's Morning Squawk recaps the biggest stories investors should know before the stock market opens, every weekday morning.Subscribe here to get access today.5.
