Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social."This wasn't a coincidence, this was triple sabotage at the UN," wrote Trump, whose post was tweeted by the White House.Trump, who said he was sending his post to the U.N.'s secretary general to demand an investigation, wrote that an escalator he and First Lady Melania Trump were boarding at the U.N. on Tuesday "came to a screeching halt" as he headed to make a speech to the General Assembly. "It stopped on a dime. It's amazing that Melania and I didn't fall forward onto the sharp edges of these steel steps, face first," Trump wrote. "It was only that we were each holding the handrail tightly or, it would have been a disaster.""All security tapes at the escalator should be saved, especially the emergency stop button.

"Maybe they appreciated the fact that very few people could have done what I did."But unfortunately for some people in the room, the president noted, "after making the Speech, I was told that the sound was completely off in the Auditorium where the Speech was made." "World Leaders, unless they used the interpreters' earpieces, couldn't hear a thing," Trump wrote."The first person I saw at the conclusion of the Speech was Melania, who was sitting right up front. I said, 'How did I do?'
