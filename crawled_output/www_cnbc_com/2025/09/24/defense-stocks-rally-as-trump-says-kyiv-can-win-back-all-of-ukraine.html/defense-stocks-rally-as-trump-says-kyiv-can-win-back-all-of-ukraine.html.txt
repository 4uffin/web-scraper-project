The White House leader also likened Russia to a "paper tiger" — a term that typically refers to a force that appears powerful, but is in truth ineffective.The U.S. president has previously suggested Ukraine would need to be open to giving up some of its territory in peace talks, which Washington has taken steps to broker since the start of Trump's second mandate.In separate comments on Tuesday, Trump said NATO members should shoot down Russian jets entering its airspace, following a series of reported incursions in the Polish, Romanian and Estonian skies by Russian aircraft and drones in recent weeks.watch nowVIDEO7:2907:29The U.S. is now seeing the reality in Ukraine, Hensoldt CFO saysSquawk Box EuropeDefense stocks were among the top performers on the pan-European Stoxx 600 index on Wednesday afternoon.German tank parts maker Renk was last seen trading around 6.5% higher, while Italian defense firm Leonardo and Swedish defense giant Saab both rose more than 3.5%.German defense firm Hensoldt was another top performer, up 5.8% at 3:30 p.m. London time.Hensoldt Chief Financial Officer Christian Ladurner said Trump's comments don't necessarily change the overall situation for Europe's defense industry, but that they rather reaffirm the sector's warnings that Russian President Vladmir Putin will continue to test the bloc."I think, in general, we have to say that the developments we have seen in the last two days are very encouraging for Europe," Ladurner told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe" on Wednesday."We see that the U.S. is more and more, I would say, seeing the reality, what is really happening and what has happened. So, this is encouraging for us," he added.Read moreHow Russia’s ‘salami-slicing’ strategy is testing the WestPoland scrambles aircraft after Russia launches strikes on UkrainePutin acts like he doesn't care about peace.
