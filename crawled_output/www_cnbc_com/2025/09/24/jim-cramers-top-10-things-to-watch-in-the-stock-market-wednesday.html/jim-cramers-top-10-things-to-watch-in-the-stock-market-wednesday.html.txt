The S & P 500 was looking at a slightly higher open this morning after breaking a three-session winning streak. Tech stocks, which had been a drag on yesterday's market, were looking better this morning. The S & P 500 closed Monday at a record high. My new book, "How to Make Money in Any Market," is set to go on sale next week. I'm kicking it off in New York City with a signing at the 555 5th Avenue Barnes & Noble store this coming Tuesday at noon ET. 2. Memory chipmaker Micron 's quarterly sales and profit topped expectations. Really good sales across PC and mobile as well as its cloud memory segment, thanks to AI. The stock wasn't moving much this morning, but it had been on a tear into the print. Citi went to $200 from $175 with its price target and kept its buy rating. 3. Citi and UBS analysts raised their Corning price targets, saying it is a fabulous data center play in cabling. That's not even to mention Corning's expanded partnership with Apple on device screen glass. Based on my recent meeting with Corning CEO Wendell Weeks, the stock still has a lot of upside . Shares have already gained 70% this year. 4. Wells Fargo upgraded Amazon to buy from hold. The analysts also boosted their price target to $280 from $245. They predicted Amazon Web Services revenue acceleration following their analysis of the impact of Anthropic, which we recently explored as well. 5. On the e-commerce side, Stifel analysts attributed Amazon's inclusion of fresh groceries in its free same-day delivery service for Prime members as a reason for Instacart shares' underperformance. While Stifel cut its Instacart price target to $56 from $64, it still reflects roughly 30% upside in the stock. They also kept their buy rating. 6. Chinese tech giant Alibaba' s New York-listed shares spiked almost 9% on a slew of AI announcements, including a partnership with Club name Nvidia on robotics models, an expansion of its cloud data center footprint into new regions, and a new large language model. Bank of America upped its price target to $195 from $168 7. Morgan Stanley downgraded Adobe to a hold-equivalent rating from buy and lowered its price target to $450 from $520. The analysts say that AI monetization is taking longer than expected, and they see cleaner near-term stories elsewhere. Software-as-a-service stocks such as Adobe and Salesforce have had tough years. 8. On the other hand, Morgan Stanley is getting more positive on ServiceNow shares, which have struggled with similar AI concerns. The firm upgraded the stock to an overweight buy rating from hold and upped its price target to $1,250 from $1,040. That new PT implies a 35% upside. The analysts see big subscription and cash flow growth ahead. 9. JPMorgan landed price target boosts from Citi and Truist analysts on optimism ahead of third-quarter earnings next month. They maintained their hold-equivalent neutral ratings. JPMorgan has been a great stock this year, gaining around 30%. For the Club, we like Goldman Sachs , Wells Fargo , and Capital One . 10. A wave of price target bumps for McKesson after the drug distributor's investor day. It raised its long-term adjusted EPS guidance to 13% to 16%, up from 12% to 14% previously. McKesson is one of the few health-care stocks that have been working this year.
