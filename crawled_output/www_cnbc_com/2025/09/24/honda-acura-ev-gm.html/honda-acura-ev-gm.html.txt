Another Honda-branded EV called the Prologue that's being assembled by GM will continue production in Mexico, she said.  "To better align our product portfolio with the needs of our customers and market conditions, as well as our long-term strategic goals, we can confirm the Acura ZDX has ended production," she said in an emailed statement. "ZDX has played a valuable role for the Acura brand, and will provide a foundation we will build on next year with the arrival of the all-electric Acura RSX, which will be produced at the EV Hub in Ohio in the second half of 2026, as well as with hybrid-electric Acura models now in development."Honda has sold roughly 19,000 ZDX models since the vehicle was released last year in the U.S., including more than 11,000 of the vehicles through August of this year.GM declined to comment on the vehicle, which was part of the company's plans to assist in scaling its EV production and technologies.The message to plant workers also said the companies are aligning EV production to better match slower demand for electric cars, saying that was the reasoning for the shift rather than anything to do with the relationship between the companies or the quality of products."We have a strong relationship with Honda that we've built over many years and we look forward to working with Honda on future opportunities," the message said. "Honda's decision isn't a reflection on the capabilities of the Spring Hill workforce or GM's commitment to Spring Hill."The message also said the vehicle shift does not change GM's employment plans for the facility. It's aiming to add more engine production as well as the gas-powered Chevrolet Blazer starting in 2027.Don’t miss these insights from CNBC PROTrump's $100,000 visa plan could hit these companies the hardestGoldman Sachs raises S&P 500 target for year-endChina isn't begging for Nvidia anymore.
