The 2-year Treasury yield was also more than 3 basis points higher at 3.606%. The 30-year Treasury bond yield rose more than a basis point to 4.754%.One basis point equals 0.01%, and yields and prices move in opposite directions.Yields saw a bit of a boost on Wednesday after new home sales came in better than expected for August, recording 800,000 on the month compared to the 650,000 that economists polled by Dow Jones had penciled in."As rates could decrease in the coming months, investors should see the residential market bottom out and become less of a drag on overall economic growth," said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial. "If housing recovers, the economy will more likely skirt a recession and if that's the case, risk assets historically perform well in a non-recessionary rate-cutting cycle."Investors are now awaiting more economic data this week, including existing home sales in August and second-quarter GDP growth rate on Thursday.The most hotly anticipated data this week will be the personal consumption expenditures index — an inflation measure preferred by the Federal Reserve — which is due out on Friday morning and will offer insights into price pressures and the state of the U.S. economy.Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said in a speech to business leaders on Tuesday that the central bank lowered interest rates last week due to weakness in the labor market was outweighing concerns about stubborn inflation."Near-term risks to inflation are tilted to the upside and risks to employment to the downside — a challenging situation," he said. "Two-sided risks mean that there is no risk-free path."There are also concerns about a potential federal government shut down next week after U.S. President Donald Trump cancelled planned meetings with two top Democrats in Congress to address issues that would have prevented a shutdown.The two lawmakers were trying to ensure that any stopgap deal — ensuring temporary funding — to avoid the Sept. 30 shutdown would feature protections for healthcare programs, including extending the Affordable Care Act enhanced tax credits.Subscribe to CNBC PROSubscribe to Investing ClubLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSelect Personal FinanceCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelSupply Chain ValuesClosed CaptioningDigital ProductsNews ReleasesInternshipsCorrectionsAbout CNBCAd ChoicesSite MapPodcastsCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?
