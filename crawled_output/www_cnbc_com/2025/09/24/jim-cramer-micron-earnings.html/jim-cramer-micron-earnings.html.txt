That's exactly what they did," he said. "After this titanic quarter, I think Micron can keep running."Micron is a key developer of memory and storage products. It has profited amid the artificial intelligence boom as new technology needs more and more high-tech bandwidth memory, which the company sells. Micron comfortably topped earnings and revenue estimates when it reported Tuesday. While shares initially rose in extended trading, the stock dipped during Wednesday's session to close down 2.82%.Cramer pointed to a few figures from Micron's quarter that he found impressive, namely its 46% year-over-year revenue increase. He also highlighted the company's guidance, saying it substantially raised the outlook for the current quarter.Cramer was also encouraged by management's optimistic commentary about its high-bandwidth memory products for the data center, especially CEO Sanjay Mehrotra's assertion that "AI-driven demand is accelerating." Micron's data center products are a major driver for the strong earnings results, Cramer noted. He also suggested the company seems to be successfully using AI to boost its own internal productivity. Cramer added that Micron isn't "just riding the data center wave like everybody else" but "actively innovating and getting products that are ideally suited for the data center to market faster than the competition."Micron's business doesn't just revolve around the data center, Cramer continued, saying other end markets look solid. The company upped it expectations for PC unit shipments, he continued, and it also noted that new AI-enabled smartphones require more memory chips.The company's shares have nearly doubled in 2025 so far. Expectations for Micron were extremely high going into the quarter because of its huge rally, Cramer said, so it was difficult for the stock to see gains despite the strong results."I just hope we get more pullbacks like this so that you can buy it on weakness," he said.Micron did not immediately respond to request for comment.Jim Cramer's Guide to InvestingClick here to download Jim Cramer's Guide to Investing at no cost to help you build long-term wealth and invest smarter.Sign up now for the CNBC Investing Club to follow Jim Cramer's every move in the market.DisclaimerQuestions for Cramer?
