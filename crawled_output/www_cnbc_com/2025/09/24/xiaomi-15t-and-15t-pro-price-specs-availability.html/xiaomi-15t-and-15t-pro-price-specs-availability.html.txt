In China, it is gearing up for the unveiling of its 17 series of devices, which will be its flagship."Xiaomi 15T is another important step for Xiaomi in its premiumization strategy, particularly trying to capture the slightly more budget-sensitive, spec-focused buyers that still opt for a high-end device, Runar Bjorhovde, analyst at Canalys said."One of Xiaomi's major strategic focuses in taking on the high-end."watch nowVIDEO3:4703:47Xiaomi exec on smartphone chip plansSquawk Box EuropeBut the company has bigger ambitions.
