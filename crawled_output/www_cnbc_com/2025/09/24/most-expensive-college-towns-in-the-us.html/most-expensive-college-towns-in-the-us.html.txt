Pullman, WashingtonNotable college: Washington State UniversityMedian home sale price: $452,137While most college students are more likely to rent during their time in these places, home prices in college towns can give a general sense of how expensive local rental costs are, said Redfin Chief Economist Daryl Fairweather in the report."[Housing costs] in some college towns have climbed so high they're increasingly out of reach for students, faculty and staff," Fairweather said. This can force faculty and staff to live farther from campus and may even discourage some professors from accepting jobs there.For students who have to pay tuition, additional housing expenses can lead to increased debt or require them to live further from school, Fairweather said.Want to be your own boss? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Start A Business: For First-Time Founders.
