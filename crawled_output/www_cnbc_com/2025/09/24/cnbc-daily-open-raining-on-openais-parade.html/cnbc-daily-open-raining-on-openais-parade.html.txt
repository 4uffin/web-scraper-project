Talk about bad timing. OpenAI's first Stargate development to come online — a data center in Texas that's stuffed to the brims with Oracle and Nvidia infrastructure — did so just as investors started questioning the sustainability of the artificial intelligence firm's trajectory.Shares of Nvidia and Oracle, the major players in OpenAI's push to establish data centers that are essentially the heart of ChatGPT, fell Tuesday. Their moves were all the starker when compared with their spikes on the previous day, when Nvidia and OpenAI jointly announced their $100 billion partnership.Some questions that investors appeared to be asking: Where's all that power, needed to keep the data centers running, going to come from? Is Nvidia's investment in OpenAI — which essentially gives the company money to buy its chips — uncannily similar to what happened during the 2000s Dotcom bubble?Adding to those concerns was U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's statement that "by many measures, for example, equity prices are fairly highly valued." Additionally, Powell raised concerns that there could be signs of stagflation — persistent inflation amid a flagging labor market — in the U.S. economy.That combination of events might make OpenAI CEO Sam Altman feel like the bride getting outshone on her wedding day. Or maybe not. That bride still has many suitors, waving billion-dollar checks at her.What you need to know todaySlowing U.S. employment led to rate cut. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell made those comments on Tuesday, when he warned about the growing "two-sided risks" of inflation and unemployment. He added that stock prices look "fairly highly valued."OpenAI opens first Stargate data center. It's located in Abilene, Texas, and is powered by Oracle Cloud infrastructure and Nvidia chips. OpenAI finance chief Sarah Friar said the company will bring in $13 billion in revenue this year.Micron's sales jumps 46% year on year. The company, which manufactures memory chips, announced earnings and revenue for its fiscal first quarter that beat expectations as demand for artificial intelligence hardware remains strong.U.S. tech stocks pull back. That caused the S&P 500 to close 0.55% lower Tuesday, after touching an intraday high in the session and closing at a record the previous day. The Stoxx Europe 600 added 0.28% as global chip stocks rose on Nvidia's deal with OpenAI.[PRO] Monumental needs for a 'monumental' deal. Nvidia's $100 billion investment in OpenAI will require the power consumption of 8 million U.S. households, according to a CNBC calculation. Finding that energy could be difficult.And finally...Qin Zihang | Visual China Group | Getty ImagesAltman, Huang and the last-minute negotiations that sealed the $100 billion OpenAI-Nvidia dealThrough a series of hurried negotiations, late-night calls and last-minute contract tweaks, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang struck a $100 billion partnership on Monday — hours before Altman boarded his flight to Abilene, Texas, to unveil his company's next big infrastructure push.Altman and Huang negotiated their pact largely through a mix of virtual discussions and one-on-one meetings in London, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C., with no bankers involved, according to people close to the talks who declined to be named because they weren't authorized to speak publicly on the matter.— MacKenzie Sigalos
