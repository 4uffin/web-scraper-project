Spencer Platt | Getty ImagesAll three major U.S. indexes ended Thursday in the red, bogged down by a further pullback in Oracle, as well as a jump in rates.The S&P 500 closed down 0.50% at 6,604.72, as did the Nasdaq Composite, which settled at 22,384.70. The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 173.96 points, or 0.38%, to finish at 45,947.32.Oracle slid 5%, putting the stock on track to post a third straight day of losses, as questions over the state of the artificial intelligence trade lingered. The market action appears to be reflecting concerns about record-high valuations and potentially risky circular relationships in the AI industry after some recent deals.Through Thursday's close, Oracle, which led the latest leg of the bull market, is off nearly 16% from its recent high. Thursday's decline was partly driven by a sell rating issued in new coverage by Rothschild & Co. Redburn, which predicted a 40% pullback because the "market materially overestimates" how much Oracle's recent AI deals will boost the company's core cloud business."Oracle had just a massive run-up. Some giveback and softness is probably warranted with how quickly and how dramatically the market cap has exploded," said Keith Buchanan, senior portfolio manager at Globalt Investments. He also cited "some skepticism" pertaining to the company's explosive cloud infrastructure growth projections that it reported earlier this month."The magnitude of those orders is eye-catching, but if it's concentrated into very few orders from very few end markets, then of course there's a risk," he told CNBC.Alongside Oracle, Tesla was among the day's laggards, falling 4%.A jump in yields added to the selling in tech shares, causing investors to take off some risk. The 10-year Treasury yield touched 4.2% after data on initial claims for unemployment insurance came in lower than expected.First-time filings for jobless benefits were at a seasonally adjusted 218,000 for the week ended Sept. 20, the Labor Department said Thursday. That's below the 235,000 that economists polled by Dow Jones had estimated and 14,000 less than the previous period's revised initial unemployment claims, which had also eased after seeing a brief spike the week before that.The solid jobs data, as well as a strong upward revision in second-quarter gross domestic product to 3.8%, could mean the Federal Reserve hesitates before cutting rates again, undermining a key catalyst for the bulls.Investors are also cautious ahead of the personal consumption expenditures price index due Friday and are monitoring developments regarding a potential government shutdown. If the government were to shut down, that could mean mass firings in the federal government, as the Office of Management and Budget has said in a memo that agencies should prepare "reduction in force" plans, according to NBC News.9 Hours AgoStocks close lower for third consecutive sessionAll the three major averages finished with losses for the third time on Thursday.The S&P 500 fell 0.50% to close at 6,604.72.

Allen also raised his price target by $25 to $300, which implies a 13.5% upside over Wednesday's closing level."Current levels represent a positive risk/reward here ... given catalysts ahead, capital return story and defensive nature of the platform," Allen wrote to clients in a Thursday note.— Alex Harring10 Hours AgoGovernment shutdown is 'likely to bring short-term market volatility,' Louis Navellier saysA view of the U.S. Capitol Building on Sept. 23, 2025 in Washington, DC. Anna Moneymaker | Getty ImagesIf the Congress fails to reach a deal to fund the federal government prior to next week's deadline, the market could see some turmoil in the near term, according to Louis Navellier, founder and chief investment officer of Navellier & Associates."A side risk is that the rating agencies may use it as an opportunity to put the U.S. on credit watch, something they've done before, as they are not happy with the soaring debt levels anyway," he wrote. "If a shutdown happens, it is likely to bring short-term market volatility."— Sean Conlon10 Hours AgoRosenblatt says buy Webull, sees more than 30% upside aheadRosenblatt Securities is taking a bullish stance on Webull Corporation.Shares of the digital investment platform were marginally higher in afternoon trading after analyst Chris Brendler initiated coverage of the stock with a buy rating and set his price target at $19, which implies 36% upside from Wednesday's closing level."The combination of zero commissions, mobile technology, and social media has driven retail trading into global prominence and, along with it, created opportunities for innovative new entrants to rapidly gain market share," the analyst wrote. "Combined with significant tailwinds from global 'retailification' and an expanding product set (crypto, prediction markets), we believe Webull can sustain 25+% top line growth through 2027 and significantly exceed current consensus estimates."Brendler also noted that the stock is cheaper than Robinhood Markets. Year to date, Webull has risen more than 22%, while Robinhood has surged a whopping 229%."Although not cheap, we note that Webull's closest peers trade at even higher levels, most notably Robinhood (HOOD, Unrated) at 25x on 2026 revenues. More importantly, we think Webull will grow significantly faster both on the top and bottom line than HOOD and consensus," he also said. "While we can see the argument for HOOD's dominant franchise to command a premium, Webull is growing off a much smaller base and with a largely fixed expense base, Adjusted EBITDA growth should be even faster."— Sean Conlon11 Hours AgoCipher Mining swings in volatile sessionBitcoin miner Cipher Mining is lower on Thursday, swinging from a 9% premarket gain to a worse than 10% decline on heavy volume amid a pair of headlines. The stock was trading down more than 18% at session lows.The company launched a proposed $800M 0.00% convertible senior notes due 2031 offering, earmarking proceeds for capped calls, its data center at Barber Lake and to accelerate the build-out of its 2.4GW high-performance computing pipeline.Separately, Cipher disclosed a 10-year HPC colocation deal with Fluidstack.

Therefore, he sees more downside risk to numbers over the next six to 12 months, even if there is no deterioration in fundamentals."While we don't think the company has done anything damaging to the brand, the operatingenvironment is clearly very tough at the moment, and we think it's prudent to move to the sidelines until we get evidence that they are able to 'right the ship' domestically," Nikic wrote.Shares of Lululemon were down more than 3% in afternoon trading.— Michelle Fox12 Hours AgoIntel remains 'fundamentally challenged' even after reportedly seeking Apple investment, Bernstein saysIntel reportedly seeking an investment from Apple is plausible, following a spate of recent endorsements for the chipmaker, according to Bernstein. However, the firm said the stock remains fundamentally challenged.Intel shares popped 5% Thursday, after Bloomberg, citing people familiar, said the American chipmaker has approached Apple for a potential deal. Such a deal is possible after Nvidia just last week said it's investing $5 billion in the company. The chipmaker also has the U.S. government as an investor.Yet, Berinstein's Stacy A. Rasgon, who has a market perform rating on Intel and an outperform rating on Apple, said Intel has to show it has the capacity to fill demand after losing its leadership in the chip industry.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconIntel, over one day"We have been of the belief that Intel remains fundamentally challenged though have been terrified to short it for exactly these reasons (with the shares up massively in investors' faces on announcements over the last several weeks)," Rasgon wrote. "In fact the President recently literally tweeted/'truthed' out a picture of himself watching the shares go up (we thought it was fake when we saw it and remain amazed that it was not), and as much as we hate to admit it 'Trump wants the stock to go up' may in fact be a valid bull case for now (not one we are prepared to make but given everything that is happening we wouldn't talk you out of it for now).""But we also worry that such pressure could ultimately be damaging especially if it forces Intel down paths that in hindsight we might discover they should not have taken," Rasgon continued.

"Any doubt over the Fed's future easing path could stoke volatility," the firm's Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi wrote on Thursday.
