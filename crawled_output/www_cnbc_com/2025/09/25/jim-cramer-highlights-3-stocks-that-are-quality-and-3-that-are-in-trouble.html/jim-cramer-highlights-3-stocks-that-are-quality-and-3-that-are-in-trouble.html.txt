Belvedere@Matt_BelvedereEvery weekday the CNBC Investing Club with Jim Cramer holds a "Morning Meeting" livestream at 10:20 a.m. ET. Here's a recap of Thursday's key moments. 1. The S & P 500 on Thursday was tracking for a third straight session lower, and the index was in jeopardy of breaking a three-week winning streak. The market finds itself under continued pressure because the 10-year Treasury yield keeps rising despite last week's Federal Reserve interest rate cut. Big call from Jim Cramer on "Mad Money" on Wednesday night: Sell speculative stocks on parabolic moves higher with no real earnings or revenue to speak of. 2. That begs the question: Where should that money go? Jim said it should go into high-quality stocks -- many of which are in the Investing Club portfolio. He cited Nvidia , which has been under some pressure lately, saying that at about 27 times forward earnings, the stock is cheap considering its growth rate. Jim also said Amazon is a higher multiple stock, but "not a speculative stock." Jim also highlighted the problems in the portfolio: Dover , Danaher , and Bristol Myers Squibb . They are all kind of too low to sell right now. We're debating them. 3 Jim and Director of Portfolio Analysis Jeff Marks do like Costco , but there are some questions they want answers to when the retailer reports earnings after Thursday's closing bell. While we generally know the sales numbers because Costco reports them monthly, membership fee trends and gross margins are key metrics to watch. "The problem with Costco is it sells at 52 times earnings," Jim said. The stock is a little expensive and could go lower. But Jim said he is not worried. 4. Stocks covered in Thursday's rapid fire at the end of the video were Chewy , Freeport-McMoRan , CarMax , Jabil , and CoreWeave .
