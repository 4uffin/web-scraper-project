Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Tuesday that the cooling labor market was overriding concerns about sticky inflation, prompting the central bank's first interest rate cut of the year.Back in Europe, investors were also monitoring consumer confidence figures.In their report on consumer confidence in Germany, published Thursday morning, GfK and the Nuremberg Institute for Market Decisions (NIM) said the downward trend in the consumer climate had halted due to improved income expectations.However, Rolf Bürkl, head of consumer climate at NIM, said that market watchers should approach the data with caution."Whether this marks the beginning of a sustained turnaround is more than uncertain. The consumer climate remains at an extremely low level," he explained in the report. "The geopolitical situation, concerns about jobs, and renewed fears of inflation are likely hinder a thorough recovery at the moment."Subscribe to CNBC PROSubscribe to Investing ClubLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSelect Personal FinanceCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelSupply Chain ValuesClosed CaptioningDigital ProductsNews ReleasesInternshipsCorrectionsAbout CNBCAd ChoicesSite MapPodcastsCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?
