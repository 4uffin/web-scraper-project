It dependsBreeze was launched by JetBlue's founder, David Neeleman, and debuted during the pandemic, in May 2021. The airline now serves 81 cities, with 291 nonstop routes, and a spokeswoman for the carrier said Breeze is the only airline serving 83% of them.The carrier has been working for years with the Federal Aviation Administration to win certification to fly internationally, Lukas Johnson, Breeze's chief commercial officer, said in an interview.It's the first sizeable U.S. passenger airline to win that certification since Virgin America, which was acquired by Alaska Airlines in 2016, Johnson said.He said Breeze is continuing its business model of flying its Airbus A220-300s between cities that have little to no competition from rivals and added that the new routes are "an exciting starting point for us.""We feel really confident that it's going to be a great guest response," he said.Fares for the new routes start as low as $99 one way, but Johnson said premium-class demand for its pricier, roomier seats has been strong and that there is a double-digit percentage of guests who book to a more expensive seat the second time they fly Breeze.Don’t miss these insights from CNBC PROTrump's $100,000 visa plan could hit these companies the hardestGoldman Sachs raises S&P 500 target for year-endChina isn't begging for Nvidia anymore.
