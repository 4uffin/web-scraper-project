So it will be a question mark how big the gap will be between Roche vs. Novo/LLY," she wrote in emailed comments, adding that other competitor treatments were likely to come to market ahead of Roche.It comes as rivals Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk have been racing to get their obesity pills to market, as they seek to expand their offering amid booming demand for their GLP-1 treatments. Both companies are also exploring amylin analog candidates as well as other experimental treatments.Already the pair dominate the obesity drug market, even as competition from copycat compounded pharmacies has grown.watch nowVIDEO3:0203:02GLP-1 obesity pills face off in head-to-head trialMoney MoversNevertheless, Graham suggested that newer market entrants could learn important lessons from the first round of obesity treatments. In particular, she said "next-generation" drugs should address unmet needs around tolerability, weight maintenance, treatment of comorbidities and lean muscle loss."Our differentiation relies on having that breadth of options," she said. "We can cover the breadth of this unmet need completely.""If you don't have portfolio of solutions, that's what makes it limiting," Chakravarthy added.Subscribe to CNBC PROSubscribe to Investing ClubLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSelect Personal FinanceCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelSupply Chain ValuesClosed CaptioningDigital ProductsNews ReleasesInternshipsCorrectionsAbout CNBCAd ChoicesSite MapPodcastsCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?
