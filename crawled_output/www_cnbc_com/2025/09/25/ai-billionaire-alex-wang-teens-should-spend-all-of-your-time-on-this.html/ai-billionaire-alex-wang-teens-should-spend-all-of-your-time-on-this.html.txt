AI coding apps, like Replit and Cursor, allow you to write code, or even develop a new app, without any coding or computer engineering expertise."It's actually, in some ways, this incredible moment of discontinuity where, if you just happen to spend, like, 10,000 hours playing with the tools and figuring out how to use them better than other people, that's a huge advantage," said Wang, who co-founded Scale AI in 2016 and helped build it into a tech unicorn that was most recently valued at $29 billion.Wang compared the current moment of rapid technological advancement to the early days of the computer revolution, when people like "the Bill Gates' of the world" capitalized on being early adopters of computers and software.Indeed, the Microsoft co-founder has said he spent his teen years sneaking out of his parents' house at night to spend hours learning to write software code, thanks to a fortuitous arrangement he had with a local Seattle company that gave him free computer access.Wang believes this era's teens would be wise to follow Gates' approach by spending as much time as possible learning to use AI coding tools: "That moment is happening right now — and if you are, like, 13 years old, you should spend all of your time vibe coding," he said on the podcast. "That's how you should live your life."AI's coding ability will match Wang's 'within the next five years'Wang — who has an estimated net worth of $3.2 billion, according to Forbes, and was poached by Meta in June to serve as the tech giant's new chief AI officer — is serious about AI's coding potential. Even with his massive success and standing in the industry, even Wang believes that "literally all the code I've written in my life … will be able to have been produced by an AI model within the next five years," he told "TBPN."

Despite his massive success and standing in the industry, even Wang believes that "literally all the code I've written in my life … will be able to have been produced by an AI model within the next five years," he told "TBPN."The idea of AI programs potentially being able to replicate the work of even the best coders in the world is already feeding concerns about software programming remaining a promising career choice. Companies are already increasing their use of AI coding programs, and in some cases using them to replace human programmers.But Wang and others in the industry still believe in the value of teens learning programming skills, especially in concert with familiarizing themselves with relevant AI tools that can potentially help maximize those skills. "As coding becomes easier, more people should code, not fewer!" Andrew Ng, co-founder of the Google Brain research lab, wrote in a LinkedIn post in March, adding: "One of the most important skills in the future will be the ability to tell a computer exactly what you want, so it can do that for you."Ng called this "the best time yet to learn to code," noting in the post that workers with strong coding skills will be able to use AI coding tools more effectively than anyone else, making them desirable to employers who are already seeking out employees with AI skills. And, while anyone can use AI tools to generate code and create new apps and startups, entrepreneurs "who understand the language of software through their knowledge of coding" are able to communicate what they want AI to build "much more precisely" than anyone else can, Ng added. Want to be your own boss? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Start A Business: For First-Time Founders.
