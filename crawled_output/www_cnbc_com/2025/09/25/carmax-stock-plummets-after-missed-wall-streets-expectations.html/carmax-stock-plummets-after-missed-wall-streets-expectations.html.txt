The stock is down about 44% so far this year, with the company's market cap at $6.84 billion. The company's quarterly results included revenue of roughly $6.6 billion, down 6% from a year earlier, and adjusted earnings per share of 99 cents. excluding some special factors, according to LSEG. Analysts surveyed by the financial markets data firm had expected earnings per share of $1.05 and revenue of $7.01 billion.Other key results, such as sales and net income, were also down compared with a year earlier. The company's overall vehicle sales fell 4.1% compared with the same period a year earlier, assisting in a roughly 28% decline in net income to $95.4 million.CarMax CEO Bill Nash described the fiscal second quarter that ended Aug. 31 as "challenging" in the company's quarterly release. He cited changing market conditions, a pull-ahead in sales earlier in the year due to tariff fear-buying and depreciation in its inventory fleet as some reasons for the company's lackluster performance."For the quarter, each month was down year over year, and each month got a little weaker throughout the quarter," Nash told investors on the company's quarterly call on Thursday. "But certainly, we put ourselves in a better position with the start of this quarter, both on an inventory position as well as from a pricing standpoint."Shares of other car retailers were also down after CarMax's results, as many investors and Wall Street analysts watch the company's performance as an early barometer ahead of other quarterly reporting.Shares of other vehicle retailers such as Group 1 Automotive, AutoNation, Sonic Automotive and Lithia Motors also fell Thursday, losing between roughly 2% and 6%.Correction: This story has been updated to reflect that earnings per share for the quarter were adjusted.Subscribe to CNBC PROSubscribe to Investing ClubLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSelect Personal FinanceCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelSupply Chain ValuesClosed CaptioningDigital ProductsNews ReleasesInternshipsCorrectionsAbout CNBCAd ChoicesSite MapPodcastsCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?
