Founders House presents “How to Make Work Fun Again” at SXSW 2025 on March 09, 2025.Robin Marchant | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty ImagesIf Olipop co-founder and CEO Ben Goodwin had to start his career over from square one, he would not prioritize learning to use artificial intelligence or any other technical skills, he says. For 40-year-old Goodwin, soft skills are the real driver of success and building those would be his first priority."Things that have been really important for me have been believing in myself, emotional regulation, things like storytelling, getting as good as possible at leading people as quickly as possible," says Goodwin, adding that he's been able to supplement his technical skills by hiring the right talent. "[There are] a billion people who are better at Excel than me."Goodwin, alongside co-founder David Lester, launched the prebiotic soda brand Olipop in 2018 to offer consumers a "healthier" alternative to the many popular sugar-packed drinks on the market. The company made $852,000 in gross revenue in its first year of business. Fast-forward to February 2025, Olipop was valued at $1.85 billion after raising $50 million in a Series C funding round.Though Goodwin also serves as the company's lead formulator, making him hands-on in creating new Olipop flavors, he says empathy, having a clear vision for the brand and connecting with others are the traits and skills he's needed most to help drive the business forward as CEO. 'When I think of the arc of all the stuff where I actually can provide long-term value … It's just keeping us really locked on target for the vision of the mission, making sure standards are being set correctly, and just providing that connection and leadership glue," says Goodwin. "Almost all of this is interpersonal."That's why, though AI-relevant technical skills are in high demand and many employers and business leaders view them as a nonnegotiable as more work becomes automated, those skills are simply not as important for Goodwin, he says."I actually have been avoiding AI," he says. "I don't need anything else to chip away at my critical thinking skills. I've not been investing in [my own] AI skills.""Soft skills' aren't so softGoodwin isn't the only CEO touting the importance of soft skills — and the reason actually has everything to do with AI. As workplaces become more automated, employers are placing a lot of value on those interpersonal skills that humans can still master far better than any AI programs, according to Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman. LinkedIn's "Skills on the Rise 2025" report also shows that people skills are becoming more in-demand on the job search platform."You're going to want to be creative. You're going to want to be [good at] critical thinking. And you're going to want to be flexible," Garman told CNBC's "Closing Bell Overtime" on Aug. 8. "I think the ability to learn new things and adapt is going to be just as important as any particular skill that you learn."You probably already exercise these people skills — empathy, adaptability, critical thinking, networking and leadership — in some capacity at work or in life, and you can strengthen them with some intentional practice and self-awareness, according to experts like leadership strategist Talia Fox. For example, the next time you have a conversation with someone, practice active listening and try to ask deep, insightful questions to build emotional intelligence, Fox told CNBC Make It in March 2024.You can boost your critical thinking the same way, research shows: Ask thoughtful questions and step out of your comfort zone. Grabbing lunch with a colleague you don't usually speak to or attending a work conference can build adaptability and networking skills.Professionals with these qualities are highly desirable in Goodwin's eyes, he said, as they help create an "energized and inspired workforce."Want to be your own boss? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Start A Business: For First-Time Founders.
