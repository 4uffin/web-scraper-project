The startup recently opened an office in London and says it is planning to open one in New York to meet U.S. demand.Light isn't the only startup out there using AI to streamline companies' finance and accounting processes.Pigment, a business planning and forecasting platform designed to be more user-friendly than Microsoft Excel, last year raised $145 million at a valuation north of $1 billion. More recently, accounting software startup Pennylane raised 75 million euros ($88.4 million), doubling its valuation to 2 billion euros.Currently, the market for software that helps companies manage their finances is dominated by industry behemoths like Microsoft, Oracle and SAP. However, these systems can often be cumbersome, requiring specialists to "tinker around the edges for a year or two just to make it work," according to Sanders."We service fast-growing, fast-scaling companies who need a system where they can expand really fast," Sanders told CNBC. Light's customers include Lovable, the buzzy Swedish AI firm recently valued at $2 billion, and Sana Labs, which is being acquired by Workday for $1.1 billion.Read more CNBC tech newsNvidia CEO says he's 'disappointed' after report China has banned its AI chipsAmazon CEO Jassy says company is reducing bureaucracy, which is 'anathema' to innovationOracle and Silver Lake part of TikTok investor group as Trump extends deal deadlineMeta Connect 2025: AI-powered smart glasses take center stageSanders said AI can rapidly transform how companies handle their finances. "The future of numbers is text," he says. For example, rather than sifting through company policies to find a team's meal allowance, this can be automated by an AI agent that has access to the relevant documents.Moving forward, Light wants to focus on large, enterprise-level customers that struggle with "broken processes and workflows," according to Sanders. "No human team can continuously analyze, reconcile and update thousands of pages of policies for coherence," he told CNBC.WATCH: Is Europe’s IPO market finally staging a comeback?watch nowVIDEO2:2402:24Is Europe’s IPO market finally staging a comeback?Europe Early EditionSubscribe to CNBC PROSubscribe to Investing ClubLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSelect Personal FinanceCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelSupply Chain ValuesClosed CaptioningDigital ProductsNews ReleasesInternshipsCorrectionsAbout CNBCAd ChoicesSite MapPodcastsCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?
