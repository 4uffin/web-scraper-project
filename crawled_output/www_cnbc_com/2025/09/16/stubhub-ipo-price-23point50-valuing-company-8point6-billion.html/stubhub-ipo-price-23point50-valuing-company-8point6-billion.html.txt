StubHub said its shares are expected to begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday under the symbol "STUB."The San Francisco-based company was co-founded by Eric Baker in 2000, and was acquired by eBay for $310 million seven years later. Baker reacquired StubHub in 2020 for roughly $4 billion through his new company Viagogo, which operates a ticket marketplace in Europe.StubHub has been trying to go public for the past several years, but delayed its public debut twice. The most recent stall came in April after President Donald Trump's "liberation day" tariffs roiled markets.The company filed an updated prospectus in August, effectively restarting the process to go public.The initial public offering market has bounced back in recent months after an extended dry spell due to high inflation and rising interest rates. Klarna made its debut on the NYSE last week after the online lender also delayed its IPO in April. Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss' Gemini, stablecoin issuer Circle, Peter Thiel-backed cryptocurrency exchange Bullish, and design software company Figma have all soared in their respective debuts.At the top of the pricing range StubHub offered last week, the company would have been valued at $9.2 billion. StubHub had sought a $16.5 billion valuation before it began the IPO process, CNBC previously reported. StubHub said in its updated prospectus that first-quarter revenue increased 10% from a year earlier to $397.6 million. Operating income came in at $26.8 million for the period, compared with an operating loss of $883 million one year ago.The company's net loss widened to $35.9 million from $29.7 million a year ago.Don’t miss these insights from CNBC PRONobel winner Joseph Stiglitz has a warning for bond investorsAs traditional 60/40 portfolios get riskier, BlackRock says investors should rethink their allocationsGoldman adds Walmart to September 'conviction list.'
