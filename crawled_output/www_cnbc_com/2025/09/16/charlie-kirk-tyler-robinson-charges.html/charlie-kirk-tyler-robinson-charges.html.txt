He has been held in jail without bail since his arrest Friday morning.Booking photo of Tyler RobinsonCourtesy: Utah Governor's OfficeGray said Robinson, 22, was identified as a suspect in part because his family recognized him in surveillance images released after Kirk, a married father of two, was killed last Wednesday during a crowded speaking event at Utah Valley University in Orem."Robinson's mother expressed concern to her husband that the suspect shooter looked like Robinson," and Robinson's father agreed, Gray said, reading from charging documents shared with CNBC later Tuesday.Robinson's father called his son, who "implied that he planned to take his own life," but agreed to meet with his parents at their home, those documents allege."When asked why he did it, Robinson explained there is too much evil, and [Kirk] spreads too much hate," according to the the documents.A family friend, who is a retired deputy sheriff, then met with Robinson and his parents and convinced Robinson to turn himself in, the documents show.Robinson's mother also allegedly told investigators, "Over the last year or so, her son had become more political and had started to lean more to the left, becoming more pro gay and trans-rights oriented."She also told police that in that time, Robinson "began to date his roommate, a biological male who was transitioning genders," according to the documents.The documents also detail a wide array of evidence allegedly tying Robinson to Kirk's shooting, including text messages between the suspect and his roommate and DNA that was allegedly matched to Robinson.Arizonans mourn Turning Point USA Founder Charlie Kirk outside of the Turning Point USA headquarters on Sept. 12, 2025 in Phoenix, Arizona.Charly Triballeau | AFP | Getty ImagesSeveral of the messages contained romantic sentiments, the documents show.The roommate told police that, on the day of the shooting, Robinson texted, "Drop what you're doing. Look under my keyboard," the documents allege.The roommate looked and found a note stating, "I had the opportunity to take out Charlie Kirk and I'm going to take it."After reading the note, the roommate texted Robinson, "What?????????????? You're joking, right????"Robinson replied that, "To be honest I had hoped to keep this secret till I died of old age. I am sorry to involve you."The roommate asked, "you weren't the one who did it right????"Robinson wrote back, "I am, I'm sorry."When the roommate asked why Robinson did it, he replied, "I had enough of his hatred. Some hate can't be negotiated out."Robinson also texted that he had been planning the shooting for "a bit over a week," according to the charging documents.And he discussed dropping a firearm at the university after fleeing, texting the roommate, "If I am able to grab my rifle unseen, I will have left no evidence."He added: "I'm wishing I had circled back and grabbed it as soon as I got to my vehicle, I'm worried what my old man would do if I didn't bring back grandpa's rifle."Police found the suspected murder weapon, a bolt-action .30-06 rifle with a mounted scope, nearby the shooting location. In it were multiple shell casings with etched inscriptions that appeared to reference internet memes.Robinson said in the texts with his roommate, "remember how I was engraving bullets? The f----- messages are mostly a big meme," the charging documents show.Read more CNBC politics coverageNew York City mayor candidate Curtis Sliwa says he was offered money to quit raceTrump's tennis invite from Rolex echoes Apple, Nvidia playbook for currying favor, Warren says2 dead in Dallas ICE shooting, including suspect; FBI eyes ideological motiveTrump UN escalator snafu: White House wants investigation of sudden stopTrump cancels meeting with top Democrats as government shutdown loomsEurope's work-life balance a key talent draw as Trump revamps H-1B visaTrump-Xi meeting likely to happen next year, says U.S. ambassador to ChinaTrump to meet top Dems as their health care demands fuel government shutdown riskSupreme Court lets Trump fire FTC's Slaughter for nowJimmy Kimmel suspension, Trump book, Epstein note eyed in ABC affiliate shootingCNBC has not independently verified the content of the messages.Gray was uncertain whether Robinson had retained a defense lawyer.Kirk's death has gripped the nation and generated highly charged reactions.Many of Kirk's friends and political allies have felt intense grief, and politicians across the aisle have issued forceful condemnations of political violence.But some, including President Donald Trump, Vice President JD Vance, and deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, have blamed the "radical left" for the killing and signaled plans to crack down on groups aligned with that ideology.Others on the left who criticized Kirk's right-wing politics while he was alive have continued to do so following his death, drawing outrage from the activist's supporters.Subscribe to CNBC PROSubscribe to Investing ClubLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSelect Personal FinanceCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelSupply Chain ValuesClosed CaptioningDigital ProductsNews ReleasesInternshipsCorrectionsAbout CNBCAd ChoicesSite MapPodcastsCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?
