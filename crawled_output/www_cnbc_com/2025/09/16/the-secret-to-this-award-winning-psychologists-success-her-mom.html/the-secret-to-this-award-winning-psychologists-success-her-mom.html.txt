"Everything and everyone that I interacted with in my life had an imprint on me," she says.And one of the people who's had the biggest influence on Nasserzadeh is her mother. Specifically, she says, her mother set a foundation of confidence that helped her take big leaps in her career.'I never felt my mother has an ounce of fear'Nasserzadeh's mother led by example, she says. The family is originally from Tehran, and her mother worked for the welfare system."She modeled by the way that she was," Nasserzadeh tells CNBC Make It. "I don't remember any moment of my life that I felt with her career choices, with social gatherings, with the places that she found herself — I never felt my mother has an ounce of fear."That blueprint showed Nasserzadeh what courage in various instances could look like, including at work. She also gave endless support and "unconditional love."I never felt like there could be anything in the world that I could do that she would not love me.Sara NasserzadehAuthor, speaker"I never felt like there could be anything in the world that I could do that she would not love me the way that she did," she says. Even when Nasserzadeh would mess up as a kid, her mother would listen calmly to the situation and simply try to remind her to avoid the mistake next time."I think that's a sense of security that you will never forget, that gives you courage, that gives you a sense of self respect, a sense of self worth," she saysToday, regardless of what Nasserzadeh is faced with in her career, from getting up on stage to working with celebrities and politicians, "I am not fazed by anything," she says, adding, "I am me just because of my mother."Want to stand out, grow your network, and get more job opportunities? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How to Build a Standout Personal Brand: Online, In Person, and At Work.
