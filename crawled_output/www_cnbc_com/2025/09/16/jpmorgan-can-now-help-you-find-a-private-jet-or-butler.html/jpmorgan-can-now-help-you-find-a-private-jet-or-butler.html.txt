Kevin Dietsch | Getty ImagesJ.P. Morgan Private Bank is launching a new lifestyle service for its wealthy clients, offering discounts and referrals on everything from private jet flights and travel to household staffing and art restoration.The move comes as private banks and wealth management firms seek to find ways of serving clients outside of core investing and financial advice, which have become increasingly commoditized. J.P. Morgan said ultra-high-net-worth clients and family offices are more and more turning to their wealth advisors for broader nonfinancial advice."There is a growing trend among clients who want our advice outside of traditional wealth management," said William Sinclair, co-head of J.P. Morgan Private Bank's Global Family Office Practice. "They view J.P. Morgan as a trusted source because of our clients."The services will give J.P. Morgan Private Bank's U.S. clients access to a specialized network of companies that have been carefully vetted and curated by the bank. There is no additional charge to access the services, and clients will get exclusive offers, free consultations, discounted rates and other deals from the companies on the platform.The services include everything from private jet flights and luxury travel to household staffing, health-care management and collectibles advice. They also include aggregated financial reporting programs, bookkeeping and bill pay services (known as "CFO services"), which are in strong demand by ultra-wealthy investors and family offices.For travel advice, clients will be able to access Valerie Wilson Travel, which J.P. Morgan acquired in 2022 as part of its purchase of travel management company Frosch. The bank didn't name other companies available on the platform but said they include a wide range of providers across various services.Get Inside Wealth directly to your inboxThe Inside Wealth newsletter by Robert Frank is your weekly guide to high-net-worth investors and the industries that serve them.Subscribe here to get access today. In private aviation, clients will be able to choose from a jet card program, fractional ownership or charter, depending on their needs. For collectibles, clients will be able to get advice on managing, maintaining or selling their collections, from cataloging and restoration, to selling or buying in the primary or secondary markets.For household staffing, clients will get access to recruiting firms that specialize in family offices and households. The service will also feature financial management services and financial reporting tools, where clients can see all of their investments in one place.  Sinclair said private jet services tend to be the most requested by private bank clients, along with bill paying and payroll management for household employees. He said business owners who sell their enterprises often ask the bank to help find new health insurance plans.Emily Margolis, head of lifestyle services for the private bank, said J.P. Morgan will add more services to the platform as it grows."We're looking at physical security, insurance, more in-depth HR, areas that we see more requests," Margolis said.More In Inside WealthHow luxury brands are tapping into the Labubu crazeHayley CuccinelloFamily offices are still keen on direct deals but retreat from startup, early-stage investingHayley CuccinelloOracle's Larry Ellison made his $365 billion fortune by breaking every rule of wealth managementRobert FrankRead MoreSubscribe to CNBC PROSubscribe to Investing ClubLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSelect Personal FinanceCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelSupply Chain ValuesClosed CaptioningDigital ProductsNews ReleasesInternshipsCorrectionsAbout CNBCAd ChoicesSite MapPodcastsCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?
