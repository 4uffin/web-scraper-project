As part of the agreement, Oracle will keep its cloud deal with the platform, the people said."Where this thing is capitalized and how large it is remains to be seen," Faber said Tuesday on CNBC's "Squawk on the Street." "'I'm hearing it's actually going to be relatively small in terms of the actual size of the checks that are written for the entity itself, and it will not be something that is going to go public at some point."A senior White House official did not confirm the details of the agreement.
