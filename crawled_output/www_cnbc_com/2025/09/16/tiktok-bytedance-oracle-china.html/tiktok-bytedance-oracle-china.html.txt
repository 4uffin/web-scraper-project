As part of the agreement, Oracle will keep its cloud deal with the platform, the people said."Where this thing is capitalized and how large it is remains to be seen," Faber said Tuesday on CNBC's "Squawk on the Street." "'I'm hearing it's actually going to be relatively small in terms of the actual size of the checks that are written for the entity itself, and it will not be something that is going to go public at some point."A senior White House official did not confirm the details of the agreement. "Any details of the TikTok framework are pure speculation unless they are announced by this administration," the official told CNBC in a statement. TikTok and Oracle did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.Read more CNBC tech newsNvidia CEO says he's 'disappointed' after report China has banned its AI chipsAmazon CEO Jassy says company is reducing bureaucracy, which is 'anathema' to innovationOracle and Silver Lake part of TikTok investor group as Trump extends deal deadlineMeta Connect 2025: AI-powered smart glasses take center stageTikTok's future in the U.S. has been uncertain since 2024, when Congress passed a bill that would ban the platform unless ByteDance divested from U.S. operations.
