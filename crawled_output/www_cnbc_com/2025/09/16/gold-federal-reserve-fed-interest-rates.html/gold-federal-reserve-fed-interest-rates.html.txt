The Fed is poised to lower the cost of money even though inflation stayed stubbornly high at an annual rate of 2.9% in August. In the past quarter century, gold has never declined in price when the central bank eases monetary policy at the same time as inflation remains above the central bank's 2% target, according to Bank of America's commodity analysts. "In fact, even if we disregard the Global Financial Crisis , gold has returned around 13% annually during 'inflationary easing,'" analysts led by Michael Widmer told clients in a report on Monday. Bank of America forecasts gold will hit $4,000 an ounce in 2026. Gold futures have gained more than 40% in 2025 alone, to reach $3,729 per ounce as of mid-morning Tuesday.
