Kind of want to follow the Marshawn Lynch method. I don't want to touch that. I want to invest it, put it in the right peoples' hands and learn as I continue to make investments. And just live off the endorsement deals,'" Barkley told ESPN in June 2018.Barkley has endorsement deals with brands including Nike, Pepsi and Toyota. He earns an estimated $10 million per year from endorsements, sports marketing analyst Bob Dorfman told Front Office Sports in January.The NFL star initially parked much of his rookie contract in traditional long-term investments like S&P 500 index funds, The Profile reported. He's also put some of his earnings into real estate, including his recent purchase of a $3.9 million home in Malvern, Pennsylvania.More recently, he's embraced some risk — investing in mobile payments app Strike in 2021, and announcing plans to convert all his marketing and endorsement earnings to bitcoin using the app, for example. Since then, the price of bitcoin has more than tripled, "turning a $10 million income stream into a $35 million asset," The Profile noted.More broadly, startup investing can be a risky approach to money management: Young companies, even trendy ones with lofty valuations, are never guaranteed to succeed. Barkley has funded more than 10 startups, usually at between $250,000 and $500,000 per startup, The Profile reported — likely only constituting a fraction of his career earnings, so far.His shift into startup investing began after he read Thiel's book "Zero to One," and he identifies his targets through word-of-mouth referrals from his business manager Ken Katz's investor network, according to The Profile. Barkley interrogates a company's founder or founders directly before choosing to invest, he told the publication."It's about asking them what they stand for, what their mission is, why they think they'll be successful," said Barkley. "They have to be confident, but arrogance is a turn-off."Barkley, 28, kicked off his 8th NFL season — more than double the length of the average NFL player's career — on September 4. He received some extra motivation to grow his wealth as much as possible during his playing career from a severe injury in 2020, when a torn ACL cause him to miss most of his third NFL season, he told the "The Best Business Show" podcast in an episode that aired in July 2021.The injury forced Barkley to reflect, he said: Running backs endure a lot of physical contact, and tend to have shorter careers than many other professional athletes. If he wasn't going to play for as long as some other superstar athletes — people like LeBron James or Tom Brady — he needed to embrace financial strategies outside of football "to create generational wealth" with his paychecks, he said."When you sit out of football for a whole year, you realize that this game could be taken away from you," said Barkley.Want to stand out, grow your network, and get more job opportunities? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How to Build a Standout Personal Brand: Online, In Person, and At Work.
