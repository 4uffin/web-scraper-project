Cox said that the suspect participated frequently in gaming and internet culture."Friends have confirmed that there was that deep, dark internet, Reddit culture and these other dark places of the internet, where this person was going deep," Cox said on NBC's "Meet the Press.""You saw that on the casings. I didn't have any idea what those inscriptions meant, but they are certainly the meme-ification that is happening in our society today."A number of casings found with the rifle allegedly used in the shooting were engraved with messages, including one that said, "hey fascist! CATCH!"The governor on Sunday also confirmed a New York Times report that said that Robinson had communicated on the messaging platform Discord after the shooting."All we can confirm is that those conversations definitely were happening, and they did not believe it was actually him," he said on ABC News."It was all joking until, until he, you know, until he admitted that it actually was him," he continued.As many questions remain over the grisly killing, Cox said that official charges in the case are expected to be filed on Tuesday, "and there will be much more evidence and information available then.""We're interviewing all kinds of people, everyone that knows him, and trying to learn more about what that motive actually was," he said.Cox also confirmed reports that investigators have interviewed Robinson's roommate, who was described as a "romantic partner" and is transitioning from male to female."This partner has been incredibly cooperative, had no idea that this was happening, and is working with investigators right now," Cox said on CNN.Subscribe to CNBC PROSubscribe to Investing ClubLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSelect Personal FinanceCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelSupply Chain ValuesClosed CaptioningDigital ProductsNews ReleasesInternshipsCorrectionsAbout CNBCAd ChoicesSite MapPodcastsCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?
