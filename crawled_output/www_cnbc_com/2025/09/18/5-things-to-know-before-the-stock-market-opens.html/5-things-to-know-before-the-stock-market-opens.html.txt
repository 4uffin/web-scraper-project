Fed meeting 101The Federal Reserve lowered interest rates by a quarter-point yesterday. While the move was widely expected, the central bank's economic projections and Chair Jerome Powell's press conference left us with many clues as to what's next for monetary policy.Here's what to know:The Fed signaled that two more interest rate cuts could be in the cards this year, but it forecasted just one in 2026. Traders had been hoping for two to three next year.Powell characterized yesterday's rate decrease as a "risk management cut," which could help to explain the stock market's tempered reaction. The Dow ended the day in the green but significantly off session highs, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite closed the session lower.Only one voter on the Fed's rate-setting committee disagreed with the move. Fed Governor Stephen Miran, who was just confirmed by the Senate on Monday, called for a half-point decrease.Here's what the rate cut means for mortgages, car loans, credit cards and more.Stocks are rallying in premarket trading as the dust settles.
