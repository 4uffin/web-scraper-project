That referred to the network's parent company, Paramount, agreeing to pay $16 million for Trump's future library to settle a lawsuit by him over the editing of a "60 Minutes" interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris, who was running against him in the 2024 presidential election.A week after the cancellation was announced, the FCC approved an $8 billion merger between Paramount and Skydance Media.Colbert noted Thursday night that ABC suspended Kimmel hours after Nexstar Media Group said that its stations affiliated with ABC would preempt the show "for the foreseeable future" because of Kimmel's statements about Trump.Nexstar needs the FCC's approval for its planned $6.2 billion merger with TegnaPeople in Colbert's audience praised his defiant stance after the taping of the show.John Carter, a 61-year-old New Jersey resident, told CNBC, "He really said no matter what you do, we're not going to let you get away with this madness."Another Garden State resident in the audience, Camille Carter, said, "I would be surprised if he makes it to the end of his contract in May.""Steven is putting himself out there on our behalf and raising the alarm," said Solyasela Escudlo, a 45-year-old from the Bronx. "It takes a lot of courage to do what he did tonight, and it was simply stating facts that democracy depends on free speech."Corey Dickinson, 63, said, "Our country is under great threat of freedom of speech. This is a turning point in America, and a very scary time.""However, my wife and I both said to ourselves after watching this episode that we both felt like we were watching history in the making, and this might very well be Stephen Colbert's last show on CBS," said Dickinson, who lives in Palm Springs, California.Jimmy Fallon, the host of NBC's "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon," reportedly opened the taping of that show Thursday with jokes about Kimmel's suspension, before becoming serious."To be honest with you all, I don't know what's going on — no one does," Fallon said, according to people who attended the taping who spoke with the industry news site LateNighter."But I do know Jimmy Kimmel, and he is a decent, funny, and loving guy," Fallon said, according to the outlet. "And I hope he comes back."Earlier Thursday, late-night legend David Letterman called the suspension of Kimmel's show "ridiculous," saying, "You can't go around firing somebody because you're fearful or trying to suck up to an authoritarian criminal administration in the Oval Office.""I feel bad about this because we all see where this is going, correct?" Letterman told Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg at The Atlantic Festival in New York.David Letterman takes part in the 2025 Atlantic Festival at PAC NYC on Sept. 18, 2025 in New York City.Michael Loccisano | Getty Images"It's managed media," said Letterman, who hosted shows on CBS and NBC for more than three decades."And it's no good. It's silly. It's ridiculous," he said.Letterman compared ABC's move to the decision by CBS to cancel Colbert's show."They took care of Colbert," Letterman said.Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump says Murdochs are potential TikTok deal partnersThe U.S. states with the most — and least — H-1B visa applications and renewalsTrump aide denies Kimmel suspended because of WH pressure despite Carr threatBig Tech firms scramble after Trump slaps $100,000 fee on H-1B visasFormer Disney CEO Eisner backs Jimmy Kimmel, blasts FCC 'intimidation' of ABCTed Cruz compares FCC Chair Carr to Mafia boss in Jimmy Kimmel warningsTrump says 'I'm winning' after judge tosses his $15 billion NY Times lawsuitTrump, Xi make progress on TikTok deal, but more work remains, White House says'Tonight, we are all Jimmy Kimmel,' Colbert says, calling Trump an 'autocrat'Trump floats pulling licenses if networks are 'against' him after Kimmel suspendedTrump hints at 'good news' coming on the Russia-Ukraine warTrump admin asks Supreme Court to allow firing of Fed Governor Lisa CookFCC Chair Carr says 'we're not done yet' after Jimmy Kimmel suspension by ABC"That was rude, that was inexcusable, the man deserves a great deal of credit, he's in the Hall of Fame nine times, and to be manipulated like that, because the Ellison family [which owned Skydance] didn't want to trouble Donald Trump with this move, so they got rid of him," Letterman said."Not only got rid of him, got rid of the whole franchise."Letterman said he's been in touch with Kimmel since the suspension was announced."He was nice enough to text me this morning," Letterman said. "And he's sitting up in bed taking nourishment. He's going to be fine."Another late-night host, Jon Stewart, on Thursday planned to host an episode of "The Daily Show."Stewart, as a rule, only hosts the Comedy Central show on Mondays. His change of routine was seen as a sign he will address Kimmel's suspension.He is set to interview Maria Ressa, a Nobel Peace Prize winner and the author of the book "How to Stand Up to a Dictator," the Associated Press reported.Variety reported Thursday that there were protests about Kimmel's suspension outside Disney's headquarters in Burbank, California, and in New York.In New York, protestors chanted, "Kimmel stays, Trump must go" and "ABC, grow a spine," according to Variety.Trump on Wednesday night crowed about Kimmel's suspension and mentioned Colbert."Congratulations to ABC for finally having the courage to do what had to be done," Trump wrote in a Truth Social post. "Kimmel has ZERO talent, and worse ratings than even Colbert, if that's possible."He suggested that NBC follow ABC's example and cancel its own evening shows, Fallon's and "Late Night with Seth Meyers."Harris, the former vice president, in a tweet on Thursday, said, "What we are witnessing is an outright abuse of power.""This administration is attacking critics and using fear as a weapon to silence anyone who would speak out," she wrote."Media corporations — from television networks to newspapers — are capitulating to these threats," Harris wrote. "We cannot dare to be silent or complacent in the face of this frontal assault on free speech."Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC.
