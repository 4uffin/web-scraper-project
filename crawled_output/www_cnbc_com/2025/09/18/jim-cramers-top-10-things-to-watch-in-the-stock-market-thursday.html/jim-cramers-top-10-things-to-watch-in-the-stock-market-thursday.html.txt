The S & P 500 was on track to open firmly higher this morning, on the heels of a volatile session yesterday after the Federal Reserve cut rates by a quarter point. Initial jobless claims dropped from last week. I'll be talking about this moment for markets at noon ET during the Investing Club's Monthly Meeting for September. Not too late to join the Club . 2. Intel saved by Nvidia : Shares of struggling Intel are rocketing higher by 28% on a pact with the AI chip giant. Club name Nvidia is investing $5 billion in Intel common stock and will co-develop data center and PC chips with the company, which is known for its traditional CPUs. Nvidia is the dominant GPU maker for AI. Better than buying Arm for Nvidia. 3. Disastrous earnings report for Cracker Barrel , sending shares down almost 7% this morning. Traffic to restaurants is down 8% since the initial logo change Aug. 19. Accordingly, management expects traffic to be down 7% to 8% for the quarter. The modern store remodel is over. Multiple price target cuts from analysts. 4. Negative preannouncement for Nucor . The steelmaker said it's expecting third-quarter earnings per share in the range of $2.05 to $2.15, well below the FactSet consensus of $2.57. Lower volumes and higher average costs are to blame. Shares dropped nearly 4% in the premarket. Nucor has been seen as a reshoring beneficiary. 5. Shares of Club name CrowdStrike were jumping almost 5% this morning after the cybersecurity provider offered up bullish long-term financial targets at an analyst day. Lots of price target hikes in response. KeyBanc went to $510 a share from $495. We highlighted how important it is to own at least one cyber stock in the age of AI in a piece for Club members yesterday . 5. Meta 's Mark Zuckerberg is charging ahead on his pursuit to make smart glasses the go-to personal computing device for AI, not the smartphone. Zuckerberg yesterday unveiled the new Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses that start at $799 and include a wristband to control the in-glasses display screen. We've been pleasantly surprised with the success of Club name Meta's Ray-Ban collab to date. 6. Mizuho Securities upped its price target on SoFi Technologies to $31 from $26, pointing to rate cuts from the Fed as a tailwind to the fintech player. The analysts, who reiterated their outperform buy rating on the stock, argued for SoFi receiving a higher valuation multiple. This really was a case of the shorts keeping this stock down. 7. Reddit landed two price target bumps: Piper Sandler went to $290 from $210, and Citizens JMP went to $300 from $225. Both shops kept their buy-equivalent ratings on the stock. Citizens sees multiple catalysts for Reddit through next year. Reddit is one of the stocks I like in my forthcoming book "How to Make Money in Any Market," which comes out Sept. 30. 8. Bank of America started coverage of low-cost drone maker AeroVironment with a buy rating, citing "strong opportunities" for growth. The firm's price target of $300 implies roughly 10% upside from yesterday's close. Back in June , I dubbed this company the next "Palantir of hardware" after its strong earnings report, adding fuel to its stock surge. 9. Controversial call from BTIG: Analysts initiated Abercrombie & Fitch with a buy rating and price target of $120. That would represent some 40% upside for the formerly high-flying stock that peaked last summer. BTIG believes multiyear growth drivers for its Hollister brand are taking shape. 10. China's Huawei unveiled a new AI chip cluster that it claims is the "world's most powerful," even better than Nvidia. Nvidia, of course, faces all kinds of geopolitical challenges in China. My question for Huawei: Which one did they benchmark against?
