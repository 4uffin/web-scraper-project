Quintanilla asked.Carr replied, "I don't speak for the president.""Our goal and our obligation here is to make sure that broadcasters are serving the public interest," Carr said.Brendan Carr, commissioner at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), speaks during the Semafor Innovating to Restore Trust in News Summit in Washington, DC, US, on Thursday, Feb. 27, 2025.Kent Nishimura | Bloomberg | Getty Images"And if there's local TV stations that don't think that running that programming does it, then they have every right under the law in their contracts to preempt it. And we'll see how this plays out.""I do think that again, we are in the midst of a massive shift in dynamics in the media ecosystem for lots of reasons, again, including the permission structure that President Trump's election has provided," the FCC chief said."And I would simply say we're not done yet with seeing the consequences of that," he said.CNBC anchor David Faber followed up on that."What does that mean when you say you're not done yet?" Faber asked. "Then, I mean, will you only be pleased when none of these comedians have a show on broadcast television?"Carr replied, "No, it's not any particular show or any particular person. It's just we're in the midst of a very disruptive moment right now, and I just, frankly, expect that we're going to continue to see changes in the media ecosystem."Asked by anchor Jim Cramer if the U.S. government should "have someone who reviews the writers before the host says something," Carr said, "No."Speaking in England on Thursday, Trump said Kimmel "said a horrible thing about a great gentleman known as Charlie Kirk, and Jimmy Kimmel is not a talented person.""He had very bad ratings, and they should have fired him a long time ago. So, you know, you can call that free speech or not," Trump said. "He was fired for lack of talent."Kimmel has not been fired."Jimmy Kimmel Live!" airs every weeknight at 11:35 p.m. ET and features a diverse lineup of guests that include celebrities, athletes, musical acts, comedians and human interest subjects, along with comedy bits and a house band.

We can do this the easy way or the hard way," Carr told right-wing commentator Benny Johnson that day. "These companies can find ways to take action on Kimmel, or there is going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.""They have a license granted by us at the FCC, and that comes with it an obligation to operate in the public interest," Carr said.Hours after Carr's comments were reported by Johnson, Nexstar Media Group said its stations that are affiliated with ABC would preempt Kimmel's show "for the foreseeable future" because of Kimmel's remarks.Nexstar is seeking regulatory approval from the FCC for its planned $6.2 billion merger with TegnaAbout 10% of ABC affiliates are owned by Nexstar.House Democratic leaders on Thursday called for Carr's resignation, alleging that he had engaged "in the corrupt abuse of power."In a statement, the Democrats accused the FCC chairman of "bullying ABC, the employer of Jimmy Kimmel, and forcing the company to bend the knee to the Trump administration."Former President Barack Obama, in a post on X on Thursday, said, "After years of complaining about cancel culture, the current administration has taken it to a new and dangerous level by routinely threatening regulatory action against media companies unless they muzzle or fire reporters and commentators it doesn't like.""This is precisely the kind of government coercion that the First Amendment was designed to prevent — and media companies need to start standing up rather than capitulating to it," Obama wrote.Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC.
