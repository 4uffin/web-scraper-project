While retail participation has increased in recent years, overall equity allocation of nonbank investors is at the same level as in 2007 and "significantly" below the 54.6% global allocation seen at the market's top in the first quarter of 2000, the bank's analysis found. "Given the continued emergence of 'a new equity culture', a scenario where the equity allocation by investors globally keeps grinding higher over the next three years towards its previous 2000 peak, would imply 47% equity upside from here," strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou said in a note Wednesday. That means the global equity universe would soar from $120 trillion currently to $175 trillion in three years, he noted. The so-called dot-com bubble, which saw the rapid rise of tech stocks, started in the mid-1990s and reached a top in March 2000 before bursting later that year and into 2001.
