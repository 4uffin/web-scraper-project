The investment firm, which has a buy rating on shares, raised its price target to $145 from $130. That signals 17.6% upside. Shares of Wynn have been on fire this year, soaring 49% in that time. That gain also outpaces the S & P 500's 13% advance for 2025. WYNN YTD mountain WYNN YTD "We think there is considerable upside in WYNN and continue to believe this name should remain a core holding for any investor," analyst Steven Wieczynski said Wednesday in their note to clients. Wynn Resorts' international resorts business picked up this year, mainly fueled by Macao's gaming boom. Just last month, Macao gaming revenue grew by 12.2% year on year to nearly $3 billion. The casino operator is also poised to benefit from the debut of its Al Marjan Island property in the United Arab Emirates, which is slated to open in early 2027. "We believe the benefits of their diversified operating platform (post-2027) are overlooked at current trading multiples," the analyst said. He added that Wynn's Macao and UAE operations could account for 45% and 15% of the business' EBITDA, respectively, in 2027. Wynn shares climbed 2% following the price target increase. Most analysts are bullish on Wynn Resorts. Of the 19 who cover it, 17 rate it a buy or strong buy, according to LSEG.
