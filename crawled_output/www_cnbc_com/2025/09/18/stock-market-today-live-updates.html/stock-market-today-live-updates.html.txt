The S&P 500 settled up 0.49% at 6,664.36, while the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.72% to finish at 22,631.48.The small-cap Russell 2000 dipped 0.7%, taking back some gains this week after the index touched a fresh record high earlier in the session.Apple led the way higher, rising 3.2%, as the company's latest iPhone went on sale around the world.

The Russell 2000 gained 2.2%, notched its seventh weekly advance.Stocks got a boost this week after the Fed lowered its benchmark overnight lending rate by a quarter percentage point, its first rate reduction since December. The move was widely expected by markets, but stocks had a volatile session on the back of the decision after Fed Chair Jerome Powell in his press conference characterized the decision as a "risk management cut.""While September has historically delivered pullbacks, this year's market has defied that pattern — climbing 35% since March with strong technical and fundamental tailwinds," said Mark Hackett, chief market strategist at Nationwide. "Still, with the S&P 500 trading at 22x forward earnings and volatility suppressed, a period of consolidation or choppiness would be a normal and healthy development."5 Hours AgoStocks close at highs on FridayU.S. equities closed out a winning week.The S&P 500 added 0.49% to close at 6,664.36.
