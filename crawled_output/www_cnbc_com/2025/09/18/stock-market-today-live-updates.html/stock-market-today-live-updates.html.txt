"Still, with the S&P 500 trading at 22x forward earnings and volatility suppressed, a period of consolidation or choppiness would be a normal and healthy development."Fri, Sep 19 20254:07 PM EDTStocks close at highs on FridayU.S. equities closed out a winning week.The S&P 500 added 0.49% to close at 6,664.36.
