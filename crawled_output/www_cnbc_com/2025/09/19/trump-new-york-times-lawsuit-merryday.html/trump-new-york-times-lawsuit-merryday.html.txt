Leon Neal | Via ReutersA federal judge in Tampa, Florida, on Friday dismissed President Donald Trump's $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times as "decidedly improper and impermissible," but is allowing Trump to refile a much shorter and less florid amended civil complaint within the next month.Judge Steven Merryday criticized Trump's lengthy lawsuit — which accuses the Times of being a "mouthpiece" for the Democratic Party — for being way too long on praise for the president and "superfluous allegations."Trump later said, "I'm winning, I'm winning the cases," after ABC News reporter Jonathan Karl pointed out during an Oval Office event that Merryday had tossed out his lawsuit. Trump then attacked Karl, saying, "You're guilty, Jon, you're guilty. ABC is a terrible network, a very unfair network, and you should be ashamed of yourself. NBC is equally bad. I don't know who's worse."Merryday noted Trump's lawsuit, which was filed only on Monday, "consumes" 85 pages, and that Trump's two civil counts against the newspaper are only detailed in the last few pages, after many, many pages of fulminating about Trump's foes and boasting of his business and political accomplishments."As every lawyer knows (or is presumed to know), a complaint is not a public forum for vituperation and invective — not a protected platform to rage against an adversary," wrote Merryday, who was appointed to the federal bench by former President George H.W. Bush."A complaint is not a megaphone for public relations or a podium for a passionate oration at a political rally or the functional equivalent of the Hyde Park Speakers' Corner," the judge said, referring to London's famed free-speech haven.Merryday gave Trump and his lawyers 28 days to file an amended lawsuit against the Times, four of its reporters, and Penguin Random House, who were all named as defendants in the original complaint.But he warned them not to make it longer than 40 pages, "excluding only the caption, the signature, and any attachment.""This action will begin, will continue, and will end in accord with the rules of procedure and in a professional and dignified manner," the judge wrote.Penguin was named in the complaint because Trump's lawyers said it had "published a false,malicious, and defamatory book titled "Lucky Loser: How Donald Trump Squandered His Father's Fortune and Created the Illusion of Success" by two of the Times reporters named in the suit, Susanne Craig and Russ Buettner.A spokesman for Trump's legal team, in a statement to CNBC about the judge's order, said, "President Trump will continue to hold the Fake News accountable through this powerhouse lawsuit against the New York Times, its reporters, and Penguin Random House, in accordance with the judge's direction on logistics."A spokesperson for the Times said, "We welcome the judge's quick ruling, which recognized that the complaint was a political document rather than a serious legal filing."Subscribe to CNBC PROSubscribe to Investing ClubLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSelect Personal FinanceCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelSupply Chain ValuesClosed CaptioningDigital ProductsNews ReleasesInternshipsCorrectionsAbout CNBCAd ChoicesSite MapPodcastsCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?
