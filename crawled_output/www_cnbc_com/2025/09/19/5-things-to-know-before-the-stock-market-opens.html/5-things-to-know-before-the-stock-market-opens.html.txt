The cost of Walmart's digital growthSerene Lee | SOPA Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesWalmart's online marketplace has exploded in recent years. But a major investigation from CNBC published this morning shows that this growth has stemmed in part from lax requirements for third-party sellers.CNBC's Gabrielle Fonrouge and Paige Tortorelli found dozens of vendors on Walmart's platform who have taken on the identities of other businesses when creating accounts, some of whom were selling counterfeit health and beauty products. Bob Barchiesi, the president of the non-profit International Anti-Counterfeiting Coalition, said Walmart's digital platform looks "more like a flea market than a trusted marketplace."Through interviews with marketplace sellers and current and former employees, CNBC found that Walmart made its vetting process more lax in hopes of encouraging sellers to jump from Amazon to its own platform. In a statement, Walmart said it has a "zero-tolerance policy for prohibited or noncompliant products" and has invested in tools to ensure product authenticity. Weeks after CNBC shared its reporting with the company, Walmart also tightened vetting for certain sellers and products.Experts warn that consumers face a higher risk of accidentally purchasing counterfeit products through online marketplaces than from traditional retailers. Along with its investigation into Walmart's practices, CNBC also released a new guide today for how shoppers can ensure they aren't buying fake products.2.

The president's comments followed CNBC's interview with Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr, during which he suggested that more changes to the media landscape are coming. "We're not done yet," Carr said.Meanwhile, fellow late-night talk show host Stephen Colbert is coming to Kimmel's defense. In his show last night, which was dedicated to free speech and Kimmel's team, Colbert called ABC's decision "blatant censorship" and Trump an "autocrat."3.
