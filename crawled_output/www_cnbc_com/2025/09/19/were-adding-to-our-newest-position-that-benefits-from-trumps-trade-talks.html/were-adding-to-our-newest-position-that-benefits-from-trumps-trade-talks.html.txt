Following the trade, Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust will own 350 shares of BA, increasing its weighting to about 2.0% from about 1.40%. We're buying more shares of Boeing and scaling deeper into this position with the stock down nearly 10% from its recent highs. We dedicated a portion of our Monthly Meeting on Thursday to discuss our thesis in this aircraft maker, which is our newest position. The three key points are: The company is enjoying a significant increase in orders due to President Donald Trump's trade agreements with other countries. It is seeing improving operating results under CEO Kelly Ortberg, with greater predictability in monthly production and delivery figure. The company has taken measures to fix up its balance sheet. Due to Trump's trade negotiations, Boeing has received orders from airlines tied to the United Kingdom, Middle East, the United Arab Emirates, Japan, and South Korea. The next one we are waiting on is an order from China, where previous reporting has indicated it could be worth as many as 500 jets. Trump is speaking with China's President Xi Jinping on Friday, and while the focus of the call is expected to be about the fate of TikTok, we're adding to our Boeing position on Friday morning just in case we see a Boeing order too. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long BA. See here for a full list of the stocks.)
