Blanc last summer, where a dear friend held a tea ceremony.Photo: Michiko TomiokaWhen I moved to the U.S. from Japan in 1994, I was very curious to try classic American fast food. But my body pushed back right away. Fast food gave me low energy, poor digestion, and even weight gain. Over time, I realized that much of what we call "food" here is engineered to be addictive, not nourishing.Today, I live by the same principles I grew up with: simple home-cooked meals, rice, seasonal vegetables, fermented foods, green tea, and fruits. Nothing extreme. I respect my body and strive for balance.At the same time, I understand that fast food is everywhere. Sometimes, it's tempting and hard to escape. But here are five fast foods in particular that I personally avoid — and how I stay healthy without giving up convenience.1. Hot dogs and sodaHot dogs are essentially processed meat high in saturated fat and sodium, wrapped in a refined carb bun. Paired with soda (even diet soda), you've got a combo that contributes to obesity, inflammation, type 2 diabetes, and even cancer.What I eat instead: Tofu dumplings or grilled tofu sandwiches make great alternatives. For something a little lighter, try a whole grain pita with hummus, avocado, or falafel. To quench my thirst, I'll have sparkling water or herbal tea.Veggie tofu dumplings are just as filling.Photo: Michiko Tomioka2. Hamburgers and French friesThis typical fast food combo often contains over 1,000 calories, mostly from saturated fat, salt, and processed ingredients. Add a sugary drink, and you're getting a full day's worth of empty calories in one meal.From a health and environmental view, meat-heavy diets contribute to both heart disease and environmental strain. It takes 1,800 gallons of water to produce just one pound of beef.What I eat instead: When I'm craving something hearty, I roast potatoes, pumpkin, or sweet potatoes with garlic, olive oil, and a touch of cinnamon. It's filling, flavorful, and nourishing.I also love tofu burgers. They're delicious, protein-rich, and packed with vitamins and minerals, without all the cholesterol. I always make extra to keep in the fridge or freezer.3. Fried chicken or chicken nuggetsMany people think chicken is a healthier choice than beef. But most fast food versions are highly processed, deep-fried, and filled with questionable ingredients. And chicken breast still contains cholesterol, especially if you're eating it with the skin on. Even worse, many chicken nuggets are made with only 45% real meat.What I eat instead: I love homemade tofu nuggets (baked and seasoned with garlic, paprika, ginger, sesame seeds, and nori flakes). They have an equally satisfying crunch and are packed with protein.4. Donuts and sugary coffee drinksDonuts are soft, sweet, and easy to overeat. But they're mostly refined flour and sugar with almost no nutritional value. Pair that with a sweet, creamy coffee drink, and you're consuming up to 800 calories and 100 grams of sugar in one sitting.What I eat instead: Whole grain rice ball or toast with nut butter and a banana. Make your own instant coffee with unsweetened soy milk and cinnamon. It just takes two minutes and you're out the door!5. Pizza and cheese sticksPizza is universally loved. But fast food versions are usually high in calories, sodium, and saturated fat, with little fiber or fresh ingredients. It's easy to grab "just one more slice," especially in social settings.What I eat instead: If you must have pizza, go for just one slice. Pair it with a side salad, and drink lots of water. At home, I make my own with whole wheat dough, homemade tomato sauce, and seasonal vegetables.How to survive the fast food temptationLife is unpredictable. Kids get hungry and parents get busy. Here's how I stay grounded when fast food is the only option.1. Don't get too hungry. Hunger leads to poor choices. I always carry emergency snacks like dried fruit, unsalted nuts, or rice crackers to keep hunger at bay.2. Follow the "5-A-Day" rule. Aim for at least five servings of fruits and veggies daily. Choose meals with whole foods, fiber, and plenty of color.Zoom In IconArrows pointing outwardsAvoid impulse snack purchases by always keeping some nuts and dried fruit everywhere you go!Photo: Michiko Tomioka3. Ditch the "value meal" mindset. Upsizing fries or drinks is a health cost, not a bargain!4. Slow down, even with fast food. Take deep breaths, chew slowly, and eat mindfully to aid digestion and avoid overeating.Michiko Tomioka, MBA, RDN is a certified nutritionist and longevity expert. Born and raised Nara, Japan, her approach focuses on a plant-based diet.
