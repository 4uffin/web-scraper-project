It has been the best year for IPOs since 2021, though still far below the Covid offering boom years, when over $142 billion (2021) and $78 billion (2020) was raised by IPOs.This year's deal flow has been highlighted by hot AI names like Coreweave, as well as some of the startup world's most highly valued firms from the past decade, such as fintech Klarna and design firm Figma, crypto companies Circle, Bullish and Gemini, and some long-awaited IPO candidates finally hitting the market, such as Stubhub this week, though its shares have slumped since the first day of trading. Top Amazon reseller Pattern went public on Friday.Other startups are expected to pursue deals given the increased investor appetite.The Renaissance IPO ETF is up 20% this year.Launched by CEO Ariel Cohen and co-founder Ilan Twig in 2015, Navan set out to disrupt a business travel sector where incumbents relied on clunky legacy tools and fragmented workflows.NavanThe Palo Alto-based company, formerly called TripActions, refers to itself as an "all-in-one super app" for corporate travel and expenses.Customers include Unilever, Adobe, Christie's, Blue Origin and Geico.It has also been pushing further into AI, with a virtual assistant named Ava handling approximately 50% of user interactions during the six months ended July 31, according to the filing, and a proprietary AI framework called Navan Cognition supporting its platform, as well as proprietary cloud infrastructure."We built Navan for the road warriors, for CEOs and CFOs who understand travel's critical importance to their strategy, the finance teams who demand precision and control, the executive assistants juggling itineraries, and the program admins ensuring seamless events," the co-founders wrote in an IPO filing letter."We saw firsthand the frustration of clunky, outdated systems. Travelers were forced to cobble together solutions, wait for hours on hold to book or change travel, and negotiate with travel agents. They struggled to adhere to company policies, with little visibility into those policies, and after all that, they spent even more time on tedious expense reports after a trip. We felt the pain of finance teams struggling to gain visibility into fragmented travel spending and to enforce policies, and the frustration of suppliers unable to connect directly with the high-value business travelers they sought to serve," they wrote in the filing.The company has been preparing for an eventual IPO since last year, when it made several key executive moves tied to the plans. Navan is backed by major investors including Andreessen Horowitz, Coatue, Goldman Sachs, and Lightspeed. Navan has raised more than $1.5 billion in venture funding to date and was last valued at $9.2 billion. Revenue grew 33% year-over-year from $402 million in fiscal 2024 to $537 million in fiscal 2025, according to the S-1 filing. The company reported a net loss that decreased 45% year-over-year from $332 million in fiscal 2024 to $181 million in fiscal 2025. Losses moved higher again by 8% in the most recent six month period included in the filing, from $93 million for the six months ended July 31, 2024 to $100 million for the six months ended July 31, 2025. Gross margin improved from 60% in fiscal 2024 to 68% in fiscal 2025.The business travel and expense space is crowded, with fellow Disruptors Ramp and Brex, and TravelPerk, as well as incumbents like SAP Concur and American Express Global Business Travel.Sign up for our weekly, original newsletter that goes beyond the annual Disruptor 50 list, offering a closer look at list-making companies and their innovative founders.More In CNBC Disruptor 50OpenAI leads private market surge as 7 tech startups reach combined $1.3 trillion valuationMacKenzie Sigalos2025 CNBC Disruptor 50: See the full list of companies leading new era of AI breakthroughs and richesCNBC.com staffAnduril tops 2025 CNBC Disruptor 50 list as interest and investment in defense tech boomsJulia BoorstinRead MoreSubscribe to CNBC PROSubscribe to Investing ClubLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSelect Personal FinanceCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelSupply Chain ValuesClosed CaptioningDigital ProductsNews ReleasesInternshipsCorrectionsAbout CNBCAd ChoicesSite MapPodcastsCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?
