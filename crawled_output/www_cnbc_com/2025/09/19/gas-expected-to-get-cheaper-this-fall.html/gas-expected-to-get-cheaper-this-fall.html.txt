The Northeast has seen some price increases due to its reliance on imported gasoline.Prices on the West Coast and in the Northeast are expected to drop "quite substantially" and should return to a more normal balance with the national average over the next six to eight weeks as supply issues are resolved, De Haan says."There will be probably more relief in the West Coast and the Northeastern U.S. over the next eight weeks than other regions," De Haan says.Want to be your own boss? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Start A Business: For First-Time Founders.
