NYSEU.S. Treasury yields rose on Friday as investors weighed the state of the U.S. economy and future monetary policy after the Federal Reserve on Wednesday cut interest rates for the first time this year.The 10-year Treasury note yield gained more than 2 basis points to 4.127%. The 2-year Treasury yield added less than 1 basis point to 3.572%. The intraday yield on both was the highest in two weeks, since Sept. 5.The 30-year Treasury bond yield added 2.5 basis points to 4.745%.One basis point is equal to 0.01%, and yields and prices move in opposite directions.The backup in longer-dated U.S. Treasury yields is counterintuitive against the backdrop of sliding short-term rates. But investors in longer maturity debt weigh expectations not only for future short-term rates but also the likely course of economic growth, inflation and government finances, including how much the debt U.S. have to sell to finance current spending and roll over existing debt."U.S. Treasury 10-yr yield continues to crawl higher, not lower, for the second straight day after the Fed cut. That syncs with rising GDP estimates and inflation moving slightly higher," said Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute.The Federal Reserve this week lowered its benchmark overnight lending rate by a quarter percentage point to a range between 4.00%-4.25%. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell described the move as "risk management," and policymakers indicated two more rate cuts are likely at their remaining meetings in late October and early December this year.Fewer jobless claims released in a weekly report on Thursday calmed investor concerns about a slowing U.S. economy and recent signs of cracks in the labor market, after a spike in claims last week led to worries that layoffs are growing.No economic data is set for release Friday, but investors next week will look to the August personal consumption expenditures index — the Fed's preferred inflation gauge — for further insights into the pace of price pressures and the effect of tariffs on the U.S. economy.Subscribe to CNBC PROSubscribe to Investing ClubLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSelect Personal FinanceCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelSupply Chain ValuesClosed CaptioningDigital ProductsNews ReleasesInternshipsCorrectionsAbout CNBCAd ChoicesSite MapPodcastsCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?
