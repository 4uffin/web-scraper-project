The iPhone 17 and iPhone Air are officially on sale today. I'm a believer that this new lineup of phones, especially the Air, is exciting enough to drive upgrades. Shares of Club name Apple could sure use that boost while the tech giant gets its artificial intelligence strategy in place. 2. Homebuilder Lennar's quarterly revenue came in light and its guidance for the current quarter is disappointing given the recent decline in mortgage rates. The increased supply of used homes for sale is hurting Lennar. Shares are down almost 3% this morning. For the Club, we own Home Depot as a bet on a housing market revival. 3. FedEx turned in a really tremendous quarter last night despite the end of the de minimis exemption, sending shares up as much as 5%. Given there isn't a lot of new commerce growth, it looks to me that they took a ton of share from UPS. CEO Raj Subramaniam's cost-cutting efforts continue. 4. Big call: Baird upgraded Tesla to an outperform buy rating from neutral, saying a physical AI inflection is ahead. Analysts said the relatively muted stock reactions following less-than-stellar quarters in Tesla's core auto business suggest the investor base is focused on future initiatives like robotics and robotaxi expansion. Baird's price target went to $548 a share from $320, implying over 30% upside. 5. Multiple price target cuts for Darden Restaurants after the Olive Garden and Longhorn parent's earnings report yesterday. While earnings per share missed, same-store sales weren't bad. But the casual-dining cohort might be the worst group in the market right now, as we know from Club name Texas Roadhouse . Commodity prices, especially beef, are hurting these stocks despite good comparable sales. 6. Barclays raised its price target on Intel to $25 from $19 and kept its equal weight rating. Shares jumped almost 23% yesterday to $30.57 thanks to the Nvidia partnership and $5 billion investment. However, Citi downgraded Intel to sell from neutral, citing unresolved concerns over its foundry business. To me, what matters is CEO Lip-Bu Tan has fixed Intel's bruised balance sheet with its recent equity deals. 7. Club name Nvidia opened up the checkbook, spending more than $900 million to hire Enfabrica CEO Rochan Sankar and other employees, and to license the AI networking startup's technology, CNBC reported . It's a move that echoes the aggressive AI talent hiring from Club stock Meta and Google this summer. 8. Trade Desk's price target was cut to $50 from $65 at Citigroup, which kept its neutral rating on the ad-tech stock. The once-loved Trade Desk traded above $120 in February, and now it's at roughly $44. Nasty decline. It appears Club name Amazon and Google crushed these guys. 9. Citi opened up a "upside 90-day catalyst watch" on Kohl's , which remarkably has more than doubled over the past three months. I've loved and owned off-price retailer TJX Companies for the Club for years. But within Kohl's traditional department store world, I favor the turnaround attempt at Macy's led by CEO Tony Spring. 10. UBS jacked up its price target on Bloom Energy to $105 from $41 and kept its buy rating on the stock, which closed yesterday at about $81. In July, Bloom Energy, which uses fuel cell technology to provide onsite power generation, partnered with Oracle on its data center initiatives. Shares have been a rocket ship since then.
