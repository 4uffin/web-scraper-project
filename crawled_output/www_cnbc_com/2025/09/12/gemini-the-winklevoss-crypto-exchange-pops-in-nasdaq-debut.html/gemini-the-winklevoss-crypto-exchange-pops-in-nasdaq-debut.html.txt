They have long held that bitcoin is a superior store of value than gold. On Friday morning, they told CNBC's "Squawk Box" they see its price reaching $1 million a decade from now.In 2013, they were the first to apply to launch a bitcoin exchange-traded fund, more than 10 years before the first bitcoin ETFs would eventually be approved. The Securities and Exchange Commission's rejection of the application, which cited risk of fraud and market manipulation, set the stage for the bitcoin ETF debate in the years to come.Even in the early days, when bitcoin was notorious for its extreme volatility and anti-establishment roots and shunned by Wall Street, the Winklevoss brothers were outspoken about the need for smart regulation that would establish rules for the crypto-led financial revolution.Correction: An earlier version of this story misstated the day it began trading.Don't miss these cryptocurrency insights from CNBC Pro: Solana was down 70% at one point this year.
