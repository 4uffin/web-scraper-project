Here's a recap of Friday's key moments. 1. The S & P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq are little changed on Friday as investors await the Federal Reserve's meeting next week. The market hit fresh highs Thursday after a warm inflation report and weaker labor data fueled expectations for an interest rate cut of 25 basis points. That decision is expected on Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET. One notable laggard, however, is Boeing . Shares of the aerospace company are down 1.4% Friday following a 3.3% drop the previous session after CEO Kelly Ortberg said the company is falling behind on 777X aircraft certification at an annual industrial conference. Club portfolio director Jeff Marks sees the stock's pullback as a buying opportunity since it doesn't change the cash flow trajectory of the business. We added to our position this morning. 2. Shares of custom AI chipmaker Broadcom edged higher after Mizuho raised its price target to $410 from $355 late Thursday, citing upside to AI revenue forecasts. The analysts lifted their estimates for fiscal years 2026 through 2028. Growth is being driven by ramped-up production with current clients and expansion to new ones like OpenAI. On Thursday, we said we would trim our Broadcom position if we weren't restricted. The stock has had such a big move since reporting last week. Our stake now exceeds 5%, and when a position gets that large, it's time to lock in gains and right-size it. 3. Looking ahead to next week, there are some key analyst events on deck. DuPont is holding an investor day to preview the new DuPont and Qnity Electronics ahead of its upcoming spinoff of its electronics business. We have our buy-equivalent 1 rating on DuPont stock and a price target of $90 per share. Cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike is also hosting its Falcon Con conference. This event comes on the back of a disappointing stock reaction in late August despite a great third quarter . We used that pullback to upgrade the stock to a 1 rating. We reiterated our price target at $520. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long BA, AVGO, DD, CRWD. See here for a full list of the stocks.)
