But missteps can happen, experts say.   ETFs brought in $540 billion in new money during the first half of 2025, which exceeded total inflows for the same period in 2024, according to Morningstar. Meanwhile, companies have launched 464 new ETFs through June, which could pass the 2024 record of more than 700."The rise of ETFs has been great for investors, but convenience can also breed complacency," said certified financial planner Jon Ulin, managing principal of Ulin & Co.

Others could include thematic ETFs, focusing on themes or trends, or leveraged ETFs, with derivatives that amplify profits and losses.   "If you don't look under the hood, you may think you're buying a diversified fund when in reality you've bought something extremely narrow and risky," Gagne said.'Chasing performance' can be costlyLike any investment, your ETF picks should match your risk tolerance, goals and timeline, experts say.But a common mistake is "chasing performance" based on past returns, which may not continue, according to CFP Michael Lofley with HBKS Wealth Advisors in Stuart, Florida. He is also a certified public accountant.Ulin said many investors "rush into buzzworthy ETFs" like bitcoin, cannabis or clean energy after seeing a rally. But "these funds can fall just as quickly as they rose," he said.You can 'erode returns' with frequent tradingOne of the benefits of ETFs is the ability to buy and sell the assets throughout the day, similar to a stock. But some investors trade too often, Gagne said."The beauty of ETFs is low cost and tax efficiency, but investors often treat them like trading vehicles instead of long-term building blocks," he said. "That behavior can quietly erode returns." Over the past 10 years through 2024, investors in U.S. open-end funds and ETFs hurt returns by trading, according to a Morningstar report released in August.   On average, these investors earned 7%, which was less than the funds' 8.2% aggregate annual total return. That 1.2 percentage point "investor return gap" was due to poorly timed buying and selling, the report found.More In ETF StrategistETFs vs. mutual funds: Key differences for investorsGreg IacurciGold is on a record run — here's how to invest, according to expertsJessica DicklerActive managers struggled 'mightily' to beat index funds amid volatility from elections, tariffs, Morningstar findsGreg IacurciRead MoreSubscribe to CNBC PROSubscribe to Investing ClubLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSelect Personal FinanceCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelSupply Chain ValuesClosed CaptioningDigital ProductsNews ReleasesInternshipsCorrectionsAbout CNBCAd ChoicesSite MapPodcastsCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?
