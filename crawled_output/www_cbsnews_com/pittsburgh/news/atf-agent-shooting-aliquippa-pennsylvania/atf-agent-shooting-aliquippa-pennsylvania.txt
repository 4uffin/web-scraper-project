An 18-year-old high school student who was shot by an agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives on Thursday evening in Aliquippa has died. The Allegheny County Medical Examiner's Office said that Kendric Curtis, 18, died at Allegheny General Hospital in Pittsburgh a little after 3 a.m. on Friday.
The shooting happened on Waugaman Street at the Linmar Terrace housing complex around 6:20 p.m. on Thursday. The 18-year-old was armed at the time of the shooting, an FBI spokesperson told KDKA-TV on Friday. In a statement Friday evening, Pennsylvania State Police said officers tried to make contact with Curtis, who fled and fired shots at officers. An officer returned firing and shot Crutis, the statement said. In a statement Thursday night, Pennsylvania State Police said ATF and FBI agents "working in a joint investigation" were involved in the shooting. It was not immediately clear why the agencies were in Aliquippa, and more details surrounding the shooting were not immediately released by authorities.   However, on Friday morning, an FBI spokesperson told KDKA-TV that Curtis was armed at the time of the shooting.
Aliquippa Mayor Dwan B. Walker said that Curtis was an Aliquippa High School student. A Trauma Support Team will be on-site at the Junior/Senior High School on Friday during student arrival and the district will have resources throughout the day as needed for students.A neighbor described an emotional and tense scene in Beaver County, highlighted by a large police presence. A photo of the scene showed at least nine police vehicles near where the shooting happened. Witnesses said they heard multiple gunshots.

"We're frustrated because we don't want this to be a new normal," resident Sandra Pope said.
The Pennsylvania State Police are investigating the shooting. The ATF said in a statement that it is "supporting" the investigation "as needed.""We're asking for clarity and calmness," Walker said. "We're asking people to search their inner self, take a deep breath, get all the facts before you snap to judgment and quick to punish."Walker added that he is praying for the victim and his family. "We are grieving together." Superintendent releases statementIn a letter sent to parents and families, Aliquippa School District Superintendent Dr. Phillip K. Woods released a statement regarding the shooting. "As a district, we are grieving together. The loss of a classmate, student, and friend is difficult for everyone, especially our children," the letter read. "I am asking our staff, parents, and community members to rally around our students during this time of sorrow. Please help them as they work through their fears, concerns, and emotions. Encourage them to lean on one another, to seek support when needed, and to continue pressing forward in faith, strength, and unity."The letter reaffirmed that Aliquippa School District will have support staff and counseling services for students and staff who may need them. Editor's note: The person who was shot and killed was previously identified by officials as being 17 years old.
