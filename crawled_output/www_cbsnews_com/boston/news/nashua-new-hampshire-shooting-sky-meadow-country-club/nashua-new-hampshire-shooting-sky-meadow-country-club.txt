One person is dead and several people were wounded during a shooting Saturday night at Sky Meadow Country Club in Nashua, New Hampshire, authorities said. A suspect was arrested and charged with murder, authorities announced Sunday morning. The incident occurred at around 8 p.m. ET at the country club located on Mountain Laurels Drive in Nashua, about 45 miles northwest of Boston, Massachusetts. The shooting lasted under one minute, according to New Hampshire Attorney General John Formella.
Formella and Nashua Police Chief Kevin Rourke announced late Saturday night that an adult man was shot and killed and two other adults were shot and wounded. One of the victims was an employee who was working as a host for the wedding and received a gunshot wound to the face while they were in the hallway, officials said. They were med-flighted to Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston and are in critical but stable condition. The other gunshot victim was a customer at the PRIME restaurant inside the country club, according to Formella. There is no update on their condition. At least four other people were injured during the shooting, including a broken hand, cuts and more, according to Curran.Authorities identified the victim as 59-year-old Robert Steven DeCesare. Formella said that DeCesare was having dinner with his family at the restaurant. An autopsy will be performed on Monday.
The suspect, identified as 23-year-old Hunter Nadeau, was arrested and charged with one count of second-degree murder. Police found Nadeau within 30 minutes of the shooting in a nearby neighborhood, according to Rourke.Formella said that Nadeau is a Nashua resident and was a former employee of Sky Meadow. He stopped working there roughly a year ago, but officials did not disclose whether he was fired or quit.
The Office of the Attorney General released Nadeau's mugshot on Sunday morning.

Additional charges will likely be brought, including for the additional shooting victims, the New Hampshire Attorney General's Office said.Authorities said there is no known connection between Nadeau and the victims. Officials said that they are working to determine his motive, but said the shooting was not a hate-motivated crime.
"We don't have any evidence at this time that would indicate that Mr. Nadeau was motivated by a hate-based motivation," said Formella.There were reports of statements that Nadeau made during the shooting, but Formella said that "the evidence leads us to believe that it is more likely that Mr. Nadeau simply tried to make a number of statements to create chaos in the moment."Police initially reported that two armed suspects had fled following the shooting and one had been detained. About an hour later, however, police said that after viewing surveillance footage, they believed there had been only one shooter and the person was in custody."Video surveillance has confirmed there was only one shooter and they are currently being detained. The scene is still an active investigation, but there is no further danger to the public," Nashua police said.Governor Kelly Ayotte has been briefed on the shooting, according to Formella. Man hits gunman in head with chairWitness Sophie Flabouris was at a wedding inside the country club. She said the shooting took place at the restaurant in the room next door. She said that someone hit the shooter over the head with a chair. The bleeding suspect ran through the wedding reception and into the kitchen, Flabouris said.
"This ended up being a fairly contained event. It lasted well under a minute and it was not nearly as tragic as it could have been. I want to commend the selfless acts of courage by the patrons in the restaurant who again put aside care for their safety and worked to intervene and stop the shooter and keep this a much more contained event than it otherwise may have been."
Flabouris said she hid under the table, then ran to safety in a nearby locker room."I first initially hid under the table with a tablecloth. Your next thought is, am I safe here? Am I a sitting duck? What's going to happen? Is this guy going to come through? Is he going to be looking under tablecloths? Is he going to be shooting everyone in the room? You don't know. It's very scary to experience something like that."Witness recounts chaos from shooting"This morning, just waking up to the realization that anything could have happened, the chaos was unbelievable, it was scary," said witness Jolene Knisell, who was on the country club's patio with her husband at the time of the shooting. "We were at the patio, which is directly umder PRIME where the shooting was. I heard somebody scream. Somebody else yelled, 'There's a gun, a shooter' so we just started running."Nadaeu is expected to be arraigned at the Ninth Circuit Court around 1 p.m. in Nashua on Monday.  Sky Meadow Country Club statementSky Meadow is a private country club with a golf course, restaurants and a function hall."I, along with everyone within the Sky Meadow Country Club community, am heartbroken over the tragic event that unfolded last night. This was the heinous act of a coward who will be held to account for what he did," said Sky Meadow Country Club owner Rob Parsons in a statement. "Sky Meadow and the City of Nashua are safe, tight-knit communities, built on fellowship, compassion, and resilience. Those values have been on full display in the thousands of messages of support we have received since this horrific incident began unfolding."Sky Meadow Country Club is located about five minutes over the Massachusetts border.
