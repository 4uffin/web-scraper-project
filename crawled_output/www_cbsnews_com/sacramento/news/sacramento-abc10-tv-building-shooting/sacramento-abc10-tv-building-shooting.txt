A man arrested in connection with a shooting at a television station building in Sacramento faces a federal charge and is back in custody after he was arrested by the FBI on Saturday. Sacramento police say officers responded to the 400 block of Broadway, the ABC10 building, just after 1:30 p.m. local time on Friday to investigate reports of shots fired. At the scene, police say officers found that the building had been struck by gunfire. Police say at least three rounds struck the building, apparently hitting a window. No injuries were reported. Police classified the incident as a drive-by shooting, saying it appeared a vehicle drove by the building, fired, then drove away. Anibal Hernandez-Santana, 64, was arrested by the Sacramento Police Department on three charges related to a drive-by shooting at the ABC10 building in Sacramento on Friday. He was arrested on charges of assault with a deadly weapon, shooting into an occupied building, and negligent discharge of a firearm, according to the Sacramento Police Department. By Saturday afternoon, Hernandez-Santana was released on bail, listed at $200,000.
Hernandez-Santana was arrested later the same day by the FBI, a spokesperson confirms to CBS Sacramento, on probable cause of willfully or maliciously interfering with or causing interference to a radio communications station.The defense attorney for Hernandez-Santana said Sunday that he was caught off guard by the FBI's involvement in the case. Hernandez-Santana is scheduled to make his initial appearance in federal court in Sacramento on Monday. He will make his first appearance on the local charges in Sacramento on Tuesday. The motive for the shooting remains under investigation, the department said.

KXTV Channel 10 is an ABC affiliate station owned by Tegna. ABC sparked controversy this week when it suspended "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" after the host's comments about the death of Charlie Kirk.
"We haven't had a lot of attacks on our media partners, and we'd like to keep it that way," said Anthony Gamble, a public information officer for the Sacramento Police Department. "This is unacceptable behavior. And so you know, to those that may have been responsible for this, and I hope you see this, we're not going to stop looking for you. This is unacceptable behavior. It's not going to be tolerated in Sacramento.""While details are still limited, importantly all of our employees are safe and unharmed," said Molly McMahon, a spokesperson for Tegna. "We are fully cooperating with law enforcement and have taken additional measures to ensure the continued safety of our employees."California Gov. Gavin Newsom's office issued a statement on X after the governor was briefed on the shooting. "While no injuries have been reported, any act of violence toward journalists is an attack on our democracy itself and must be condemned in the strongest terms," Newsom's office said. "We stand with reporters and staff who work every day to keep communities informed and safe!"
