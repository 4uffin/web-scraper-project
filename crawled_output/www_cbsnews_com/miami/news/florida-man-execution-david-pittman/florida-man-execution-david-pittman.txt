David Pittman, a Florida man convicted of killing his estranged wife's sister and parents and setting their house on fire in 1990, was executed by lethal injection Wednesday evening at Florida State Prison. Pittman, 63, was pronounced dead at 6:12 p.m., according to the Department of Corrections. His execution marked the 12th in Florida this year — the most in a single year since the state reinstated the death penalty — and the 31st in the U.S. in 2025.Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, has signed more death warrants this year than any of his predecessors. Two additional executions are already scheduled in Florida this fall.Pittman was sentenced to death in 1991 for the murders of Clarence and Barbara Knowles, both in their 50s, and their 21-year-old daughter Bonnie Knowles. Investigators said Pittman, who was in the midst of a bitter divorce from the Knowles' other daughter, Marie, had previously threatened the family.
Trial testimony showed he cut the phone line at their Mulberry home before fatally stabbing them, setting the house ablaze, and stealing Bonnie's car, which he later torched as well.Jurors convicted Pittman on three counts of first-degree murder, as well as arson and grand theft, recommending the death penalty in a 9-3 vote.His attorneys argued in recent appeals that Pittman suffered from intellectual disabilities, citing an IQ in the low 70s, and claimed his execution would violate constitutional protections against putting to death a person with severe mental impairments.
Courts rejected those arguments, with the U.S. Supreme Court denying his final appeal Tuesday.
Florida carries out executions using a three-drug injection: a sedative, a paralytic and a drug that stops the heart. Witnesses reported that the procedure proceeded without complications.The state's last execution occurred Aug. 28, when 59-year-old Curtis Windom was put to death for a 1992 triple murder in Orlando.
