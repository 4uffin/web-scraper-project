The Taliban government on Sunday rejected U.S. President Trump's bid to retake Bagram Air Base, four years after America's chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan left the sprawling military facility in the Taliban's hands.Mr. Trump on Saturday renewed his call to reestablish a U.S. presence at Bagram, even saying "we're talking now to Afghanistan" about the matter. He did not offer further details about the purported conversations. Asked by a reporter if he'd consider deploying U.S. troops to take the base, the president demurred."We won't talk about that," Mr. Trump said. "We want it back, and we want it back right away. If they don't do it, you're going to find out what I'm going to do."Mr. Trump followed up with a social media post saying "If Afghanistan doesn't give Bagram Airbase back to those that built it, the United States of America, BAD THINGS ARE GOING TO HAPPEN!!!" On Sunday, chief Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid rejected Mr. Trump's assertions and urged the U.S. to adopt a policy of "realism and rationality."
Afghanistan had an economy-oriented foreign policy and sought constructive relations with all states on the basis of mutual and shared interests, Mujahid posted on X.It had been consistently communicated to the U.S. in all bilateral negotiations that Afghanistan's independence and territorial integrity were of the utmost importance, he said."It should be recalled that, under the Doha Agreement, the United States pledged that 'it will not use or threaten force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Afghanistan, nor interfere in its internal affairs,'" he said. The U.S. needed to remain faithful to its commitments, he added.Mujahid did not reply to questions from The Associated Press about conversations with the Trump administration regarding Bagram and why Mr. Trump believed the U.S. could retake it.
'Ceding Afghan soil is out of the question'Earlier Sunday, the chief of staff at the Defense Ministry, Fasihuddin Fitrat, addressed Mr. Trump's comments. "Ceding even an inch of our soil to anyone is out of the question and impossible," he said during a speech broadcast by Afghan media.In August last year, the Taliban celebrated the third anniversary of their takeover at Bagram with a grand military display of abandoned U.S. hardware, catching the eye of the White House. Mr. Trump has repeatedly criticized his predecessor, Joe Biden, for his "gross incompetence" during the withdrawal of U.S. forces after the country's longest war.Mr. Trump last week, during his state visit to the United Kingdom, hinted that the Taliban, who have struggled with an economic crisis, international legitimacy, internal rifts and rival militant groups since their return to power in 2021, could be game to allow the U.S. military to return."We're trying to get it back because they need things from us," Mr. Trump said of the Taliban. While the U.S. and the Taliban have no formal diplomatic ties, the sides have had hostage conversations. An American man who was abducted more than two years ago while traveling through Afghanistan as a tourist was released by the Taliban in March.The Taliban also said they reached an agreement with U.S. envoys on an exchange of prisoners as part of an effort to normalize relations between the United States and Afghanistan.They gave no details of the detainee swap, and the White House did not comment on the meeting in Kabul or the results described in a Taliban statement. The Taliban released photographs from their talks, showing their foreign minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, with Mr. Trump's special envoy for hostage response, Adam Boehler.
