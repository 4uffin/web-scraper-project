Erika Kirk, the widow of Charlie Kirk, said in her first public remarks since her husband's death that he will be "wearing the glorious crown of a martyr." Charlie Kirk, a conservative activist and co-founder of Turning Point USA, died Wednesday after he was shot at an event at Utah Valley University. He was speaking to a large crowd at an outdoor "Prove Me Wrong" debate, where he invites students to challenge his political and cultural views. Law enforcement officials on Friday announced the arrest of 22-year-old Tyler Robinson for the shooting death of Charlie Kirk.Erika thanked Vice President JD Vance, second lady Usha Vance and President Trump for their support since the shooting."Mr. President, my husband loved you and he knew that you loved him too," she said, standing at a podium where a photo of her husband was displayed.

Erika said Friday that the scheduled Turning Point USA tour, "The American Comeback Tour," will continue after her husband's killing.
The next stop is scheduled for Sept. 18 at Colorado State University in Fort Collins."It will be greater than ever," she said, adding, "The radio and podcast show that he was so proud of will go on."Erika said that her husband's "movement is not going anywhere." "If you thought that my husband's mission was powerful before, you have no idea," she said. "You have no idea what you've just unleashed across this entire country, and this world. You have no idea the fire you've ignited within this wife. The cries of this widow will echo around the world like a battle cry."
Erika Kirk, 36, began dating Charlie Kirk in 2018 and they married in 2021. The couple had two children: a 1-year-old son and a 3-year-old daughter."He was the perfect father. He was the perfect husband," Erika said.Erika was born in Arizona and graduated from Arizona State University. She also played NCAA women's basketball for Regis University in Colorado, according to her biography on her website. She won the Miss Arizona USA title in 2012 and later earned a Juris Master's degree in American Legal Studies from Liberty University in 2017. She is currently studying for a doctorate in Biblical studies at Liberty University, her website says. She also founded Proclaim, a faith-based clothing line, and hosts a podcast, "Midweek Rise Up," according to her website.
