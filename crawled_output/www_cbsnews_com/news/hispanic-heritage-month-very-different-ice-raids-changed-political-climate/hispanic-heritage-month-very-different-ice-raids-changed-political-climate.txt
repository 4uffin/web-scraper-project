Many Hispanic Heritage Month celebrations scrapped due to ICE raid fears, changed political climate

Each year during Hispanic Heritage Month, huge celebrations can be expected across the U.S. to showcase the diversity and culture of Hispanic people. This year, the Trump administration's immigration crackdowns, a federally led English-only initiative and an anti-diversity, equity and inclusion push have changed the national climate in which these celebrations occur. Organizers across the country, from Massachusetts and North Carolina to California and Washington state, have postponed or canceled heritage month festivals altogether. Celebrated each year from Sept. 15 to Oct. 15, the month is a chance for many in the U.S. to learn about and celebrate the contributions of Hispanic cultures, the country's fastest-growing racial or ethnic minority, according to the U.S. Census. The group includes people whose ancestors come from Spain, Mexico, the Caribbean and Central and South America. More than 68 million people identify as ethnically Hispanic in the U.S., according to the latest census estimates. Before there was National Hispanic Heritage Month, there was Hispanic Heritage Week, which was created through legislation sponsored by Mexican American U.S. Rep Edward R. Roybal of Los Angeles and signed into law in 1968 by President Lyndon B. Johnson.
The weeklong commemoration was expanded to a month two decades later, with legislation signed into law by President Ronald Reagan. "It was clustered around big celebrations for the community," Alberto Lammers, director of communications at the UCLA Latino Policy and Politics Institute said. "It became a chance for people to know Hispanic cultures, for Latinos to get to know a community better and for the American public to understand a little better the long history of Latinos in the U.S." Sept. 15 was chosen as the starting point to coincide with the anniversary of "El Grito de Dolores," or the "Cry of Dolores," which was issued in 1810 from a town in Mexico that launched the country's war for independence from Spain. The Central American nations of Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Costa Rica celebrate their independence on Sept. 15 and Mexico marks its national day on Sept. 16, the day after the cry for independence.
Also during National Hispanic Heritage Month, the South American nation of Chile observes its independence day on Sept. 18. The White House so far has not mentioned any planned events. Last year, President Joe Biden hosted a reception and issued a proclamation for the occasion.
Hispanic was a term coined by the federal government for people descended from Spanish-speaking cultures. But for some, the label has a connotation of political conservatism and emphasizes a connection to Spain. It sometimes gets mistakenly interchanged with "Latino" or "Latinx." For some, Latino reflects their ties to Latin America. So some celebrations are referred to as Latinx or Latin Heritage Month. Latin Americans are not a monolith. There are several other identifiers for Latin Americans, depending largely on personal preference. Mexican Americans who grew up during the 1960s Civil Rights era may identify as Chicano. Other may go by their family's nation of origin such as Colombian American or Salvadoran American. Each culture has unique differences when it comes to music, food, art and other cultural touchstones. September typically has no shortage of festivities. Events often include traditional Latin foods and entertainment like mariachi bands, folklórico and salsa dance lessons. The intent is to showcase the culture of Mexico, Puerto Rico, Venezuela and other Latin countries.
Masked ICE agents carrying out President Trump's policies via workplace raids at farms, manufacturing plants and elsewhere - which has included detaining legal residents - led some to fear large gatherings would become additional targets for raids. Another obstacle heritage celebrations face is the perception that they'd violate bans on DEI programming - something Mr. Trump has discouraged across federal agencies. Some companies and universities have followed suit. Early in September, organizers of a Mexican Independence festival in Chicago announced they would postpone celebrations due to Trump's promises of an immigration crackdown in the city. "It was a painful decision, but holding El Grito Chicago at this time puts the safety of our community at stake - and that's a risk we are unwilling to take," said the organizers of the festival. A new date has not yet been announced. Though Mexican Independence Day falls on Sept. 16, celebrations in Chicago typically span more than a week and draw hundreds of thousands of participants for lively parades, festivals, street parties and car caravans. "The fact that the federal government is sending troops as we start these celebrations is an insult," Illinois state Sen. Karina Villa, a Democrat, said at a news conference. "It is a fear tactic. It's unforgivable." Similarly, Sacramento's annual Mexican Independence Day festival was canceled with organizers citing the political climate and safety concerns. Other events that have been canceled include the Hispanic Heritage Festival of the Carolinas, Hispanic Heritage Fest in Kenner, Louisiana and FIESTA Indianapolis.
Ivan Sandoval-Cervantes, an anthropology professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, said when celebrations are canceled from the top down it affects how we see them throughout the country. Used to seeing celebrations in Las Vegas advertised, he has seen very little leading up to this year's heritage month. "If it's not being celebrated by a specific state that doesn't mean they won't be celebrated but they might go into the private sphere," Sandoval-Cervantes said. "Where it's safer to embrace the symbols or even speak Spanish." In Mexico, the government launched a new appeal to raise awareness among Mexican migrants to take every possible precaution during the holidays because any incident, such as while driving, could lead to a deportation. "Rather than not celebrating, be cautious" and gather at the consulates, President Claudia Sheinbaum said Friday. On Thursday, Mexico's foreign affairs secretary said there would be more consular staff on duty to respond to any emergency. Mexican nationals stopped by U.S. authorities are advised to not flee, remain silent and not sign any documents. Chicago Latino leaders called on residents to remain peaceful during expected protests at Mexican Independence Day celebrations, arguing that any unrest could be used as justification for sending federal troops to the city. "We will not allow others to use our fear or our anger against us," said Berto Aguayo, of the Chicago Latino Caucus Association. "We will not take the bait. We will know our rights. We will protect each other and peacefully protest."
