Emmy nominations 2025: "Severance," "The Studio" lead the pack for this year's awards
Emmy nominations 2025: "Severance," "The Studio" lead the pack for this year's awards
00:44
"Severance," "The White Lotus," "The Studio" and "Hacks" are among the shows that earned top nominations for the 77th annual Primetime Emmy Awards as the 2025 nominees were announced Tuesday morning. "Severance," an Apple TV+ show that wrapped its second season, earned 27 nominations overall, followed by 24 nominations for HBO Max's "The Penguin," and 23 nominations each for HBO Max's "The White Lotus" and Apple TV+'s "The Studio," which now joins "The Bear" for having the most nominations racked up by a comedy series in a single year. Among the nominations this year is a first-ever for veteran movie star Harrison Ford, who at 83 years old earned his first Emmy nomination for his supporting role in the sitcom "Shrinking." This year's nominations were announced by actors Harvey Guillén ("What We Do in the Shadows") and Brenda Song ("Running Point"). Two categories were unveiled exclusively on "CBS Mornings" — the nominees for outstanding reality competition and for outstanding talk series. Last year's Emmys were a coronation for FX, with the cable network's "Shōgun" and "The Bear" both earning wins in the double digits, though the latter missed out on the top award for comedies, which instead went to HBO's "Hacks." Netflix's biggest player was in the limited series categories, where "Baby Reindeer" won multiple trophies.
The 77th annual Primetime Emmy Awards will be broadcast live on CBS on Sunday, Sept. 14, with comedian Nate Bargatze as host. Bargatze received a nomination himself Tuesday morning for his variety special "Your Friend, Nate Bargatze."Here are the nominees in the Emmy Awards' top categories: Outstanding drama series"Andor" (Disney+)"The Diplomat" (Netflix)"The Last of Us" (HBO Max)"Paradise" (Hulu)"The Pitt" (HBO Max)"Severance" (Apple TV+)"Slow Horses" (Apple TV+)"The White Lotus" (HBO Max)Outstanding comedy series"Abbott Elementary" (ABC)"The Bear" (FX)"Hacks" (HBO Max)"Nobody Wants This" (Netflix)"Only Murders in the Building" (Hulu)"Shrinking" (Apple TV+)"The Studio" (Apple TV+)"What We Do in the Shadows" (FX)Outstanding limited or anthology series"Adolescence" (Netflix)"Black Mirror" (Netflix)"Dying for Sex" (FX)"Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story" (Netflix)"The Penguin" (HBO Max)Outstanding television movie"Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy" (Peacock)"The Gorge" (Apple TV+)"Mountainhead" (HBO Max)"Nonnas" (Netflix)"Rebel Ridge" (Netflix)Outstanding reality competition program"The Amazing Race" (CBS)"RuPaul's Drag Race" (MTV)"Survivor" (CBS)"Top Chef" (Bravo)"The Traitors" (Peacock)Outstanding talk series"The Daily Show" (Comedy Central)"Jimmy Kimmel Live!"
