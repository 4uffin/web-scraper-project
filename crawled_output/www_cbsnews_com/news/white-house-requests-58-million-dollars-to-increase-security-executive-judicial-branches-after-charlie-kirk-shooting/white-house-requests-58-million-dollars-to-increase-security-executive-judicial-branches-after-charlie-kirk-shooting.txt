Government security after Kirk shooting
White House requests emergency funds to protect government officials
02:37
The Trump administration is sending a $58 million request to Congress to increase security for the executive and judicial branches in the wake of the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, multiple sources familiar with the matter told CBS News Saturday.Punchbowl was first to report the news.A White House official confirmed the extra funds would be directed to the U.S. Marshals Service and would also include enhanced protection for Supreme Court justices.Additionally, the Trump administration expressed support for increased funding to protect congressional lawmakers, but may defer to the legislative branch on that.This all comes ahead of a Sept. 30 government funding deadline.
CBS News previously reported on a new pilot program for House members that launched in August that provides an extra allowance for members to hire personal security or make upgrades at home.House Speaker Mike Johnson said late this week a "deliberate" and thorough review of the program is underway. The Senate is also considering additional safety precautions.  "We've got to protect people who run for public office or no one will, and that's heavy on our hearts and minds, as we also, you know, work through the trauma of what happened," Johnson told reporters Thursday. U.S. Capitol Police Chief Michael Sullivan told CBS News that the department expects to track more than 14,000 threats to members by the end of the year, significantly outpacing previous years. Sullivan said USCP will be operating at a "heightened posture" going forward.
"We're prepared to continue to react and keep the members of Congress safe," Sullivan said.
