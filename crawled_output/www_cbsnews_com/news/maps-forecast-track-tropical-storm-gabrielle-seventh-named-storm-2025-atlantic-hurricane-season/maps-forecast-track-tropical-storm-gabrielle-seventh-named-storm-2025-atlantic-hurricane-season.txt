Tracking Tropical Storm Gabrielle
Tracking Tropical Storm Gabrielle as it forms over Atlantic Ocean
03:06
Gabrielle strengthened into a hurricane Sunday, days after forming in the Atlantic Ocean, becoming the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season.The Miami-based National Hurricane Center said Gabrielle's center is expected to pass east of Bermuda on Monday. No watches or warnings were in effect, however. Gabrielle was situated roughly 320 miles southeast of Bermuda. It was tracking north-northwest at 10 mph, the hurricane center said, with maximum sustained winds of 75 mph, making it a Category 1 hurricane. The hurricane center warned that rapid strengthening could occur over the next day or two.Swells generated by Gabrielle were forecast to reach the East Coast from North Carolina northward to Atlantic Canada on Sunday, with swells continuing into early next week, the hurricane center said."These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions," the center said.

Tropical-storm-force winds extended outward some 140 miles from Gabrielle's center, the hurricane center said. The storm will likely continue to move northwest through Sunday, the agency said, then turn to the north on Monday and northeast on Tuesday.
Gabrielle took shape about one week after what was historically considered the peak of the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs annually from June 1 to Nov. 30 and has in the past become most active around Sept. 10.

NOAA
Officials at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration initially predicted the 2025 season would be busier than usual and produce more named storms than an average year. Still, hurricane activity has so far been quieter than anticipated. At the start of the season, NOAA's outlook suggested that between 13 and 19 named storms would form in the Atlantic, with as many as nine strengthening into hurricanes and as many as five becoming Category 5 storms, which are the most powerful. The agency revised the outlook slightly in August, predicting that the season would see 13 to 18 named storms, including five to nine hurricanes, two of which could be major.Of the six named tropical storms that have developed this year before Gabrielle, only one, Chantal, made landfall in the U.S.
