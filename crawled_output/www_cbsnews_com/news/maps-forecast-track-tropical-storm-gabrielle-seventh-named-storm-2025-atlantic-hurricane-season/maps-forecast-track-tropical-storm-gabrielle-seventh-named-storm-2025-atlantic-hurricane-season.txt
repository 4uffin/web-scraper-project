Tracking Tropical Storm Gabrielle
Tracking Tropical Storm Gabrielle as it forms over Atlantic Ocean
03:06
Tropical Storm Gabrielle continued to strengthen Saturday after forming Wednesday morning over the central Atlantic Ocean, becoming the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season. Forecasters expect the weather system to remain over open waters for the next several days. Gabrielle is forecast to become a hurricane by late Saturday or Sunday, according to the Miami-based National Hurricane Center, and its center was expected to pass by Bermuda on Sunday night or Monday. No watches or warnings were in effect, however. As of Saturday evening, Gabrielle was situated roughly 575 miles north-northeast of the northern Leeward Islands and nearly 580 miles southeast of Bermuda. It was tracking northwest at 10 mph, the hurricane center said, and maximum sustained winds of 65 mph.

Tropical-storm-force winds extended outward some 140 miles from Gabrielle's center, the hurricane center said. The storm will likely continue to move northwest through Sunday, the agency said, then make a turn to the northeast on Monday. "Swells generated by Gabrielle should reach the east coast of the United States from North Carolina northward, along with Atlantic Canada, later this weekend into early next week," the hurricane center said Saturday. Gabrielle took shape about one week after what was historically considered the peak of the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs annually from June 1 to Nov. 30 and has in the past become most active around Sept. 10.

NOAA
Officials at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration initially predicted the 2025 season would be busier than usual and produce more named storms than an average year, but hurricane activity has so far been quieter than anticipated.
At the start of the season, NOAA's outlook suggested that between 13 and 19 named storms would form in the Atlantic, with as many as nine strengthening into hurricanes and as many as five becoming Category 5 storms, which are the most powerful. The agency revised the outlook slightly in August, predicting that the season would see 13 to 18 named storms, including five to nine hurricanes, two of which could be major.Of the six named tropical storms that have developed this year before Gabrielle, only one, Chantal, made landfall in the U.S.
