Nexstar Media on Tuesday said it will continue to preempt "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" on its television stations when the late-night show returns tonight after an almost week-long hiatus on ABC. Nexstar's move parallels that of local TV station owner Sinclair, which on Monday said it would also continue to preempt the show after it returns to ABC. Both Nexstar and Sinclair own ABC-affiliated television stations.On Tuesday, Nexstar said it will "monitor the show as it returns to ABC."Last week, ABC had indefinitely preempted the show following comments Kimmel made on the show in response to the shooting death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The decisions by Nexstar and Sinclair, two of the largest owners of TV affiliates, mean "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" won't appear tonight on dozens of ABC stations in cities across the U.S. The two corporations collectively control about a quarter of ABC affiliates. Nexstar operates 33 ABC affiliates, with its largest market represented by WKRN-TV in Nashville. Sinclair runs 38 ABC stations, including KOMO-TV in Seattle.
At the same time, Nexstar has a $6.2 billion deal pending to purchase Tegna, a smaller rival, and requires approval from the Federal Communications Commission to move forward with the acquisition.
Last week, a Nexstar spokesperson told CBS News that the decision was "made unilaterally by the senior executive team at Nexstar, and they had no communication with the FCC or any government agency prior to making that decision."In its Tuesday statement, Nexstar said it stands by its decision last week to preempt the show "pending assurance that all parties are committed to fostering an environment of respectful, constructive dialogue in the markets we serve."It added, "In the meantime, we note that 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' will be available nationwide on multiple Disney-owned streaming products, while our stations will focus on continuing to produce local news and other programming relevant to their respective markets."
Guests scheduled to appear on Kimmel's show on Tuesday include actor Glen Powell and singer Sarah McLachlan.
