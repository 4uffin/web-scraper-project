Oscar-winning Palestinian director Basel Adra says Israeli soldiers raided his West Bank home

Palestinian Oscar-winning director Basel Adra said Israeli soldiers conducted a raid at his West Bank home on Saturday, searching for him and going through his wife's phone.Israeli settlers attacked his village, injuring two of his brothers and one cousin, Adra told The Associated Press. He accompanied them to the hospital. While there, he said that he heard from family in the village that nine Israeli soldiers had stormed his home.The soldiers asked his wife, Suha, about his whereabouts and went through her phone, he said, while his 9-month-old daughter was home. They also briefly detained one of his uncles, he said.As of Saturday night, Adra said he had no way of returning home to check on his family, because soldiers were blocking the entrance to the village and he was scared of being detained.Israel's military said that soldiers were in the village after Palestinians had thrown rocks, injuring two Israeli civilians. It said its forces were still in the village, searching the area and questioning people.
Adra has spent his career as a journalist and filmmaker chronicling settler violence in Masafer Yatta, a group of villages in the southern reaches of the West Bank, where he was born. After settlers attacked his co-director, Hamdan Ballal, in March, he told the AP that he felt they were being targeted more intensely since winning the Oscar. Adra said he witnessed the detention and said around two dozen settlers — some masked, some carrying guns, some in Israeli uniform — attacked the village of Susiya. Ballal said the settlers beat him in front of his home while filming the assault.Adra described Saturday's events as "horrific.""Even if you are just filming the settlers, the army comes and chases you, searches your house," he said. "The whole system is built to attack us, to terrify us, to make us very scared."Another co-director, Yuval Abraham, said he was "terrified for Basel."
"What happened today in his village, we've seen this dynamic again and again, where the Israeli settlers brutally attack a Palestinian village and later on the army comes, and attacks the Palestinians.""No Other Land," which won an Oscar this year for best documentary, depicts the struggle by residents of the Masafer Yatta area to stop the Israeli military from demolishing their villages. Ballal and Adra made the joint Palestinian-Israeli production with Israeli directors Abraham and Rachel Szor.The film has won a string of international awards, starting at the Berlin International Film Festival in 2024. It has also drawn ire in Israel and abroad. In March this year, Miami Beach proposed ending the lease of a movie theater that screened the documentary, although it later backed down.Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war, along with the Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem. The Palestinians want all three for their future state and view settlement growth as a major obstacle to a two-state solution.Israel has built well over 100 settlements, home to more than 500,000 settlers who have Israeli citizenship. The 3 million Palestinians in the West Bank live under seemingly open-ended Israeli military rule, with the Western-backed Palestinian Authority administering population centers.The Israeli military designated Masafer Yatta in the southern West Bank as a live-fire training zone in the 1980s and ordered residents, mostly Arab Bedouin, to be expelled. Around 1,000 residents have largely remained in place, but soldiers regularly move in to demolish homes, tents, water tanks and olive orchards — and Palestinians fear outright expulsion could come at any time.During the war in Gaza, Israel has killed hundreds of Palestinians in the West Bank during wide-scale military operations, and there has also been a rise in settler attacks on Palestinians. There has also been a surge in Palestinian attacks on Israelis.
