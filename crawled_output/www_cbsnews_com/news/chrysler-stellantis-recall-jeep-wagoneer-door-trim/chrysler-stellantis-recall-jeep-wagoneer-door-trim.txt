Chrysler is recalling 163,735 Jeep Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer SUVs because trim on the driver and passenger doors may detach while the vehicle is in motion, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said Wednesday."Detached trim pieces can create a road hazard for other vehicles, increasing the risk of a crash," the agency said in a letter addressed to Chrysler.The recall covers model years 2022 through 2025. Dealers will inspect and replace the trim at no cost to owners. The Stellantis  spokesperson said an estimated 8,535 vehicles from Canada, 947 from Mexico and 706 from outside of North America are also subject to the recall.According to NHTSA's safety recall report, the recall is related to a vehicle assembly issue, not a parts defect."The company is unaware of any related accidents or injuries," the spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch in an email.
According to the recall notice, Stellantis-owned Chrysler said it received 405 warranty claims, three field reports and 112 service records possibly tied to the flaw.The NHTSA said letters notifying Jeep Wagoneer owners of the issue are expected to be mailed by Oct. 31. Owners can call Chrysler's customer service number at 1-800-853-1403.
