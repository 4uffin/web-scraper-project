Sanders said that the weather service had only confirmed two there since 1950.Two tornadoes developed from a storm in San Juan County, in southeastern Utah, over the span of an hour starting around 12:35 p.m. Saturday, according Sanders. The paths of the tornadoes that touched down near Montezuma Creek likely covered less than 10 miles, but the weather service hadn't yet determined their exact tracks or wind speeds, Sanders said by telephone.
