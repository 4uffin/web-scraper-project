A man in his 40s was arrested in southern England over an alleged cyberattack that disrupted several European airports in recent days, including London Heathrow, law enforcement officials said Wednesday.The U.K.'s National Crime Agency said the suspect was held in West Sussex on Tuesday on suspicion of offenses involving the misuse of computers and was released on conditional bail."Although this arrest is a positive step, the investigation into this incident is in its early stages and remains ongoing," said Paul Foster, head of the NCA's national cybercrime unit. "Cybercrime is a persistent global threat that continues to cause significant disruption to the U.K."Starting late Friday and lasting through the weekend, airports in Berlin, Brussels and London were hit by disruptions to electronic systems that snarled up check-in and sent airline staffers trying options like handwriting boarding passes or using backup laptops.Berlin Airport said in a statement Wednesday that "further disruptions to flight operations" were expected. According to the airport, check-in and boarding were "still largely manual," which could result in "longer processing times, delays, and cancellations by airlines."
"The provider of the computer-controlled passenger and baggage handling system used at BER Airport, among other locations, has announced that it may take several more days to provide functional and secure software," the airport said. "The company has called in additional specialists and is working intensively on a resolution."Heathrow Airport, which serves London, said the "vast majority" of flights there were operating normally as of Tuesday. Many other European airports were unaffected.The cyberattack affected the software of Collins Aerospace, whose systems help passengers check in, print boarding passes and bag tags, and dispatch their luggage. The U.S.-based company on Saturday cited a "cyber-related disruption" to its software at "select" airports in Europe.
It was not immediately clear who might be behind the cyberattack, but experts said it could turn out to be hackers, criminal organizations or state actors.The European Commission, the executive branch of the 27-nation European Union, said aviation safety and air traffic control were unaffected.
