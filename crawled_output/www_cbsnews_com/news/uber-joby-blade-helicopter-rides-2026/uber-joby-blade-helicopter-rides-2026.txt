Uber is taking its ride-sharing service to the skies.The San Francisco-based company said Wednesday that it will team with Joby Aviation, a maker of electric air taxis, to bring helicopter services to its platform as soon as next year. The announcement comes just over a month after Joby acquired Blade Air Mobility, which flies passengers by helicopter and seaplanes, in a $125 million deal. In a news release, Uber and Joby said that once the service is integrated, passengers will be able to book flights directly in the Uber app in the "most populated cities in the world." A spokesperson for Joby told CBS MoneyWatch that the company does not yet have details on routes or pricing, but that airport connections would be appealing to consumers. "Airport routes have long been identified as some of the highest value propositions to the public," the spokesperson said.Blade's website shows that it offers flights between Manhattan and John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York or Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey for $195. Last year, Blade flew 50,000 passengers in the New York metropolitan area and Southern Europe, according to the companies.

"Integrating Blade into the Uber app is the natural next step in our global partnership with Uber and will lay the foundation for the introduction of our quiet, zero-emissions aircraft in the years ahead," JoeBen Bevirt, founder and CEO of Joby, said in a statement.
Blade operates a fleet of helicopters powered by jet turbines but plans to transition to all-electric vertical take off and landing (eVTOL) aircrafts in the future, the spokesperson said.Uber and Joby's business relationship dates back to 2019, when Joby acquired Uber's Elevate division, which is building an aerial ride-sharing service using what's known as electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) vehicles.
