Oscar-winning actor and director Robert Redford, who died Tuesday at the age of 89, launched into Hollywood stardom in the late 1960s before going on to star in dozens of feature films over his career.Among his most iconic films were "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," "The Way We Were" and "The Sting." Other classics include "Three Days of the Condor," "All the President's Men" and "The Great Waldo Pepper."In 1980, Redford moved on to a job behind the camera — as director of "Ordinary People," for which he won an Oscar for best director. A year later he founded the Sundance Institute, which fostered the work of independent filmmakers outside of mainstream Hollywood.Here is a look at the actor in some of the classic films that defined his career.
