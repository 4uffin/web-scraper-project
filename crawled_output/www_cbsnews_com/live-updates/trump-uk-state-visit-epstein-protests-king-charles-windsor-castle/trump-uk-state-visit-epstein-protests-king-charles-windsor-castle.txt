Trump in U.K. for historic second state visit amid protests
02:21
What to know about President Trump's historic second state visit to BritainPresident Trump is in the U.K. for a historic second state visit. The trip has been marked by the trademark pomp and circumstance offered by the royal family, with a formal banquet hosted by King Charles III and Queen Camilla Wednesday evening — but Mr. Trump has not been able to avoid the Epstein scandal that has dogged him in recent weeks.  Prince William and his wife Catherine met Mr. Trump and first lady Melania Trump as their helicopter landed on the grounds of Windsor Castle Wednesday. Later in the day, Mr. Trump laid a wreath at the tomb of Queen Elizabeth II, who was laid to rest at St. George's Chapel. The president, first lady, king and queen also attended a state military ceremony.During an elaborate state dinner, Mr. Trump said visiting Windsor Castle is "one of the highest honors of my life." He and the king both spoke about the bond between the U.S. and U.K., which King Charles said has been "tested time and again."The trip comes days after Prime Minister Keir Starmer fired his ambassador to the United States, Peter Mandelson, over his past close ties with the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.While Mr. Trump and first lady Melania Trump will be insulated to a degree from protests against their visit to Britain, demonstrators have made every effort to ensure their dissatisfaction with America's divisive leader is clear to see.

Trump says visiting Windsor Castle is "one of the highest honors of my life"
The president called it a "singular privilege" to be welcomed to Windsor Castle. "This is truly one of the highest honors of my life," the president told the long table of guests at the state dinner Wednesday night. "Such respect for you and such respect for your country."

Mr. Trump said King Charles has raised a "remarkable son" in Prince William. "I think you're going to have unbelievable success in the future," he said. Mr. Trump said he's pleased to see Kate, the Princess of Wales, "so radiant and so healthy, so beautiful," seemingly a reference to her recovery from cancer. The president, too, mentioned the long and deep ties between the U.S. and U.K. "We're joined by history and fate, by love and language and by transcendent ties of culture, tradition, ancestry and destiny," the president said, calling the bond "priceless" and "eternal."Mr. Trump said the U.S. is now the "hottest country anywhere in the world," crediting the U.K. for giving the U.S. a firm footing from which to begin. The president toasted the king, "a very, very special man."

King Charles says U.S. and U.K. renew their bond "with unshakeable trust in our friendship"
King Charles formally began the state dinner with remarks about the friendship between the U.S. and U.K., one he said may have surprised their forefathers hundreds of years ago. "Anchored by the deep friendship between our people, this relationship which, with good reason, we and our predecessors have long called special, has made us safer and stronger through the generations," the king said. "Our people have fought and died together for the values we hold dear. We have innovated, traded and created together, fueling our economies and cultures through myriad forms of exchange. We have celebrated together, mourned together and stood together in the best and worst of times.""Mr. President, as we appreciate the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence next year, it is remarkable to think just how far we have come. I cannot help but wonder what our forebears from 1776 would think of this friendship today," the king continued. The king said the U.S. and U.K. have long fought "tyranny" together, and do again today as they support Ukraine. "Our countries have the closest defense, security and intelligence relationship ever known. In two world wars, we've fought together to defeat the forces of tyranny," he said. "Today as tyranny once again threatens Europe, we and our allies stand together in support of Ukraine to deter aggression and secure peace." "Mr. President, Mrs. Trump, the bond between our two nations is indeed a remarkable one. Forged in the fire of conflict, it has been fortified through our shared endeavors and burnished by the deep affection between our people," the king said. "Tested time and again, it has borne the weight of our common purpose and raised our ambition for a better world. So in renewing our bond tonight, we do so with unshakeable trust in our friendship and in our shared commitment to independence and liberty."

Protesters march in central London
Several thousand people marched through central London Wednesday to protest the president's trip. Carrying banners reading "No to the racism, no to Trump," the crowd, organized by the Stop Trump U.K. coalition, headed down Regent Street on their way to Parliament.
The crowd booed a counter protester who held a sign that read "We Love Trump." London's police force deployed 1,600 officers as they expected members of about 50 different groups that included climate, anti-racism and pro-Palestinian activists.
Many fewer people participated in the march compared to
six years ago, when Mr. Trump visited London during his first term. This visit almost entirely avoids the capital, with the main events taking place at the royal castle in Windsor, a historic town about 20 miles to the west, and at Chequers, the prime minister's country estate where Mr. Trump will meet with Starmer on Thursday.

Starmer may push Trump on key issues, U.K. journalist predicts
President Trump has a very favorable view of the U.K., and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer will try to use that to his advantage when the two hold a bilateral meeting on Thursday, British journalist Lewis Goodall told "CBS Mornings." "Keir Starmer … he's got things that he wants from President Trump," Goodall told CBS News' Adriana Diaz and Tony Doukopil. "President Trump seems to hold Britain in high regard, partly because of his own family background. His mother was from Scotland, of course, and he has generally treated us better in terms of all of the new tariffs, the tariff regimes that he's put in place by comparison to the other EU countries.""Nonetheless, there's still things that the British government would like, on things like aluminum and steel and cars and so on. Whether he gets that from President Trump is a very open question," Goodall said. The two leaders are to meet Thursday at the prime minister's country residence Chequers, following the pomp and pageantry of Wednesday's events where Mr. Trump is being hosted by King Charles at Windsor Castle.

London Mayor Sadiq Khan criticizes Trump on the eve of his state visit
Ahead of President Trump's state visit to the U.K., London Mayor Sadiq Khan urged Britons to reject "the reactionary populists and nativists who are exploiting economic concerns, the atomisation of modern life and a growing distrust of political and media institutions — something we have seen in countries across Europe and, of course, in the U.S."In an opinion piece for The Guardian newspaper, Khan, who's long been a vocal critic of Mr. Trump, said the U.S. president "and his coterie have perhaps done the most to fan the flames of divisive, far-right politics around the world in recent years."Khan said that six years after Mr. Trump's first state visit, the Trump administration's "scapegoating minorities, illegally deporting U.S. citizens, deploying the military to the streets of diverse cities … aren't just inconsistent with Western values – they're straight out of the autocrat's playbook."Khan said that while he understood the U.K. government needed to be "pragmatic" and maintain ties with the U.S., "it's also important to ensure our special relationship includes being open and honest with each other. At times, this means being a critical friend and speaking truth to power — and being clear that we reject the politics of fear and division. Showing President Trump why he must back Ukraine, not Putin. Making the case for taking the climate emergency seriously. Urging the president to stop the tariff wars that are tearing global trade apart. And putting pressure on him to do much more to end Israel's horrific onslaught on Gaza, as only he has the power to bring Israel's brazen and repeated violations of international law to an end."
