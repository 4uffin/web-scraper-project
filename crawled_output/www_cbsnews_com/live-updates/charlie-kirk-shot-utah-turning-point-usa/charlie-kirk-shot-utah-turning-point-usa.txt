Charlie Kirk's widow, Erika, vowed Friday to continue her husband's conservative activism work, saying, the "movement my husband built will not die."She said Turning Point USA will still host its fall college campus tour, and its AmericaFest conference in December will still take place."The evildoers responsible for my husband's assassination have no idea what they have done," she said.

They should all know this: If you thought that my husband's mission was powerful before, you have no idea … what you just have unleashed across this entire country and this world.""The cries of this widow will echo around the world like a battle cry," she said.Earlier in her address, she referred to her husband as a martyr.

Trump Jr. says any celebration of Kirk's killing is "truly disgusting"
Donald Trump Jr., who was a close friend of Kirk's, said any celebration of his friend's killing is "truly disgusting." The president's son was interviewed on Fox News with Martha McCallum Friday afternoon.  "It's just been very hard, Martha," he said. "When you think about what's gone on over the last few years, when you look at the vilification of Charlie that I'm seeing every day since then, the celebration of his assassination in cold blood in front of his wife and young children, it's truly disgusting."The president's son said Kirk gave a platform to "his biggest detractors." "He gave the people who hated him most an opportunity to argue their standpoint," he said.

Robinson was arrested on charges of aggravated murder, obstruction of justice for moving and hiding the gun believed to be used in the attack and felony discharge of a firearm causing bodily injury, according to a booking sheet from the Utah County Sheriff. All three are felonies.A probable cause statement details the events leading up to and after the shooting at Utah Valley University, as well as descriptions of Robinson, the suspected shooter, and his movements.Law enforcement said the suspect was spotted on the roof of the Losee Center building on campus and, after the shot rang out, was seen on surveillance footage running to the edge of the building and dropping to the grass below.The probable cause statement says the rifle recovered by police was a Mauser Model 98, .30-06 caliber bolt action rifle and had a scope mounted on top of it. It was wrapped in a dark-colored towel, according to the document.The statement also describes how Robinson came to the attention of authorities, as well as investigators' interviews with his family member and roommate, the details of which were announced by Cox earlier Friday.

Discord says it has suspended account belonging to Robinson, says messages on planning apparently not sent on platform
A spokesperson for the social media platform Discord said that it removed an account associated with Tyler Robinson, who police have accused of killing Kirk, for violating its "off-platform behavior policy.""We strongly condemn violence of any kind, including political violence, and we will continue to coordinate closely with law enforcement," a spokesperson for the company said in a statement.But the statement also refuted that messages about "planning details" were sent on the platform. Cox, Utah's governor, said during a press conference earlier Friday that Robinson's roommate showed law enforcement Discord messages affiliated with a contact "Tyler" that referenced the need to retrieve a rifle from a "drop point," leaving the gun in a bush and the rifle wrapped in a towel."We are deeply saddened by this tragedy and extend our condolences to the Kirk family and everyone affected. In the course of our investigation, we identified a Discord account associated with the suspect, but have found no evidence that the suspect planned this incident or promoted violence on Discord," the spokesperson said. "The messages referenced in recent reporting about planning details do not appear to be Discord messages."The spokesperson said the messages were "communications between the suspect's roommate and a friend after the shooting, where the roommate was recounting the contents of a note the suspect had left elsewhere."

You can only circumvent karma, she doesnt leave."In a memo to staff that was shared with CBS News, Secret Service Director Sean Curran said politically motivated attacks in the United States are on the rise, and staff shouldn't exacerbate the problem. "Let me be clear, politically motivated attacks in our nation are increasing — seemingly every day," Curran wrote.

Robinson's father recognized his son from the photographs and confronted him
Tyler Robinson's father saw the photos released by authorities and confronted his son about them, two federal law enforcement sources told CBS News. Robinson admitted to his father that he was the person in the photos, those sources said. Robinson's father urged him to turn himself in, but Robinson said he would rather commit suicide than turn himself in, the federal law enforcement sources said. Robinson's father called a youth pastor who knows Tyler and is close to the family, and he and the pastor tried to calm Robinson down. The sources said the pastor, who also serves as a court security officer, called the U.S. Marshals. The Marshals detained Robinson and kept him secure, while waiting for the FBI. The FBI then took Robinson into custody. By Pat Milton, Anna Schecter

Cox details lead-up to Robinson's arrest
At a news conference Friday morning, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox laid out the events that led to Robinson's arrest. The governor said that on the evening of Sept. 11, a family member reached out to a family friend, who then contacted the Washington County Sheriff's Office with information that Robinson had allegedly confessed or implied he committed the shooting at Utah Valley University.

That information was then relayed to the Utah County Sheriff's Office, investigators on the scene of the incident, and the FBI, Cox said. Investigators reviewed video footage and identified Robinson arriving on Utah Valley University's campus in a gray Dodge Challenger at around 8:29 a.m. local time Wednesday, the day of Kirk's event at the school, according to the governor.Robinson was wearing a plain maroon T-shirt, light-colored shorts, a black hat with a white logo and light-colored shoes, Cox said. He's believed to have changed clothing on the roof, where the shot was fired from, before changing back into what he was originally wearing. When investigators encountered Robinson early in the morning on Sept. 12, he was wearing clothing consistent with that outfit, according to the governor.Cox said that investigators interviewed one of Robinson's family members, who said he had become more political and that Robinson had mentioned Kirk was going to be at Utah Valley University. The unidentified family member said Robinson and another person discussed why they disliked Kirk, according to the governor.

Cox declined to directly tie the public release of the images of the suspected shooter to his arrest, but he said that through "some process," the suspect's family "came to know that this had happened."The governor said that when the person believed to be Robinson was first spotted on Utah Valley University's campus, he was wearing one set of clothes. Police believe he then changed on the roof, where the shot was fired from, and then changed back into his original clothing, Cox said. The governor said when the suspect was apprehended, he was wearing clothing that matched what he wore before the attack.Cox also said Robinson is not a student at Utah Valley University and has been living with his family in Washington County, located in the southwestern corner of the state. Cox said charging documents will likely be filed early next week.

Cox says Kirk's assassination is "an attack on all of us"
In an emotional appeal to young Americans, Cox spoke of the importance of respecting others who hold opposing views and warned that if there cannot safely be a "clash of ideas," there can not be solutions to the nation's problems. "This is certainly about the tragic death, assassination, political assassination of Charlie Kirk, but it is also much bigger than an attack on an individual," the governor said. "It is an attack on all of us, an attack on the American experiment, it is an attack on our ideals. This cuts to the very foundation of who we are, of who we have been and who we could be in better times."Cox said that political violence is different from other forms of violence and called for "moral clarity."He said Robinson will be charged soon for the violence he allegedly perpetrated, and said there is only one person responsible for the act: the suspected shooter."Always forgive your enemies — nothing annoys them so much," Cox said Kirk used to say.Cox said Kirk encouraged vigorous debate, and Cox said the phrase "words are violence" isn't true. "Words are not violence. Violence is violence," Cox said. He also praised the public's response to Kirk's assassination, which he said was not met with looting, burning or other violence but instead with prayers and vigils."History will dictate if this is a turning point for our country, but every single one of us gets to choose right now if this is a turning point for us," Cox said. The governor warned that political violence metastasizes, with one side pointing the finger at the other, and appealed to elected officials to resist assigning blame.

Utah has permissive gun laws, experts say
Utah allows adults to carry guns openly or conceal them without a permit, though there are restrictions for people ages 18 to 20. It does offer concealed-carry permits, which some people prefer because they are honored in other states that require them, said attorney Mitch Vilos, who specializes in Utah gun law.  Clark Aposhian, a firearms instructor and chair of the Utah Shooting Sports Council, said there is nothing in Utah's gun policies that would somehow make it easier for an assassin to kill Kirk, who was speaking outdoors to students.In public colleges, Aposhian said, a permit is required to carry a firearm, either in the open or concealed.Vilos, who was written a book about Utah gun policy, said the state believes in "protective gun laws." "The idea is to protect the innocent," he said, "as long as you're not doing things that would cause someone to believe that they're being threatened by the presence of your firearm."

Military leaders warn about some social media posts on Kirk killing
Military leaders are warning troops and Defense Department civilians about some social media posts on the Kirk shooting.Thursday evening, Chief Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said on X that, "It is unacceptable for military personnel and Department of War civilians to celebrate or mock the assassination of a fellow American.
The Department of War has zero tolerance for it." Soon after, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth added in a post on X that, "We are tracking all these very closely — and will address, immediately. Completely unacceptable."Two hours later, Army Secretary Dan Driscoll posted a similar admonition on X saying, "Posts that celebrate or mock the assassination of a fellow American are inconsistent with Army values. Full stop." Navy Secretary John Phelan took to X to say he is "aware of posts displaying contempt toward a fellow American who was assassinated. I want to be very clear: any uniformed or civilian employee of the Department of the Navy who acts in a manner that brings discredit upon the Department, the (Navy) or the (Marines) will be dealt with swiftly and decisively." And Air Force Secretary Troy Meink stressed on X that "The Department of the Air Force is aware of inappropriate comments concerning recent political violence. This behavior is unacceptable and contrary to our core values. Airmen and Guardians are expected to uphold the highest standards of professionalism and conduct at all times."The warnings drew praise and pushback from commenters.

Rep. Nancy Mace pushes for Kirk to lie in honor in Capitol
Republican Rep. Nancy Mace said Thursday she will introduce a resolution allowing Kirk's remains to lie in the Capitol Rotunda "should the Kirk family wish.""It is only fitting his life be remembered in the Capitol, where the freedoms he defended are enshrined," the South Carolina lawmaker wrote.Both the House and Senate would need to pass Mace's resolution for a ceremony to take place. It's unclear whether the resolution will get a vote.Some 14 people have lain in state or in honor in the Capitol since 2018, according to the Architect of the Capitol, the federal agency which oversees the building. Those include former Presidents Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush, former Sens. Harry Reid and John McCain, and well-known evangelist Billy Graham.Similarly, Republican Rep. Anna Paulina Luna of Florida suggested placing a statue of Kirk in the Capitol.

Utah Sen. John Curtis says "I'm going to think twice" about major events
Republican Sen. John Curtis of Utah said Thursday that Kirk's shooting at an outdoor event will likely cause his colleagues to rethink their approach to their own personal safety."The problem is, I don't see a solution," Curtis told CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett in an interview with "The Takeout," noting that there are 100 sitting senators and 435 House members, all of whom travel extensively and attend many public events. "I don't want to say it's an occupational hazard, but in many ways, I just don't know how you solve this. And the alternative is also not acceptable, which is that we stay away from people."Curtis added: "I'm not going to lie, I'm going to think twice next time I'm in the major parade just a few blocks away." "I think all of us are going to be rethinking some things, and I hope we come up with a way that allows us to stay very, very connected to those we represent," the senator said.Threats against members of Congress spiked last year, according to federal authorities. In 2024, the U.S. Capitol Police investigated nearly 9,500 threats and other concerning statements against lawmakers, their staffers and their families — up from about 8,000 a year prior.

White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, in an interview with the Scott Jennings Radio Show, said she believes the president has spoken with Kirk's family. Wiles said Kirk's shooting and death "shook everybody to their core" at the White House. She also said his death, for many in the White House, brought back memories of the attempt on Mr. Trump's life in Butler, Pennsylvania last summer. "Yesterday was a very tough day," Wiles told Jennings. "It was a roller coaster. We thought it was bad news, and then we thought there would be good news, and then ultimately, not so. So it was very rough. Charlie was very much a part of this family, and maybe the highest-profile MAGA person outside of those that are working here. So I think it shook everybody to their core, and for many of us, brought back the memories of last July, 13 in Butler with the president. And then today is 9/11, so it's sort of a one-two punch."

"He received thousands throughout his life. But he always prioritized reaching as many young Americans as possible over his own personal safety. Now, Charlie has become America's greatest martyr to the freedom of speech he so adored."Turning Point said Kirk "loved America, its people, its Constitution, its freedom, and the limitless good all of them have done for the world, but above all, Charlie lived every day with an overflowing love of the Christ he knew he would one day get to see."

He was not only a hero of the Christian faith but also the embodiment of what our Founders envisioned when they enshrined the First Amendment," Ogles wrote on X.A copy of the measure shared by the congressman to social media describes the conservative activist as "the personification of the First Amendment, never compromising the truth while also treating those with whom he disagreed with dignity and respect."The Congressional Gold Medal is the highest civilian honor awarded by Congress.Florida Rep. Cory Mills, also a Republican, introduced a resolution to honor Kirk following his assassination.

Top Democrats in Congress urge unity in wake of Kirk assassination
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, the top Democrats in Congress, called for the nation to unite following Kirk's death and said there should be no finger-pointing or blame."This is a time that all Americans should come together and feel and mourn what happened. Violence, which affects so many different people of so many different political persuasions, is an affliction of America, and coming together is what we ought to be doing, not pointing fingers or blame," Schumer said when asked by CBS News congressional correspondent Nikole Killion to respond to Mr. Trump's remarks about Kirk's death on Wednesday.In a video recorded in the Oval Office Wednesday, the president blamed the assassination on the "radical left" and said political violence and murder are the "tragic consequence of demonizing" those with opposing political views."For years, those on the radical left have compared wonderful Americans like Charlie to Nazis and the world's worst mass murderers and criminals," the president said. "This kind of rhetoric is directly responsible for the terrorism that we're seeing in our country today, and it must stop right now."Jeffries echoed Schumer's call for unity."This moment requires leadership that brings the American people together, as opposed to trying to further divide us," he said. "Political violence in any form against any American is unacceptable, should be denounced by everyone. And moving forward, we have to figure out a better way to come together, not as Democrats or Republicans, but as Americans."— Melissa Quinn and Alan He

Scalise: "We cannot let what happened yesterday be the norm"
House Majority Leader Steve Scalise said Thursday that "we cannot let what happened yesterday be the norm," as he decried political violence in the aftermath of Kirk's death."Unfortunately, we've seen politics degrading where some people feel if they disagree with you politically, they've got to try to go and eliminate those people," Scalise said on "CBS Mornings." "That is not what America is. You know, we solve our differences at the ballot box."Scalise said of Kirk that "even if people disagreed with him, he wasn't calling them names, he would engage and talk about the differences." "We've got to get back to that," he said.Scalise, who was shot by a gunman in 2017 at a practice for the annual congressional baseball game, said "it was hard to focus" on the House floor Wednesday night because "my mind just kept going back to Charlie and his family, surely went back to 2017 in the shooting where, you know, a crazed gunman tried to kill me and about a dozen other members of Congress because of our political beliefs.""This can't be allowed to be acceptable," he said. Asked what a more constructive conversation looks like, and the role Congress plays in lowering the temperature, Scalise said "one of the greatest things of America is that we do have differences and that we can express them.""Celebrate the fact that we have differences and we can freely express them, and don't allow anybody to try to threaten somebody, to try to physically attack somebody for their differences," Scalise said.

College where Kirk killed not well known but Utah's biggest public university
The Utah college where conservative activist Charlie Kirk was fatally shot Wednesday is the state's largest public university after years of rapid enrollment growth, but is lesser known than other colleges in the state.
Utah Valley University was founded under a different name in 1941 as a vocational school focused on providing war production training. It didn't begin offering four-year degrees until the 1990s, a move that fueled a fivefold increase in enrollment over the next three decades. It now has nearly 47,000 students, according to the university website.
Utah Valley University's campus is right off a major highway about 40 miles south of Salt Lake City, where the state's flagship school, the University of Utah, is located. Utah Valley is also just a few miles from Brigham Young University, which is owned by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, known widely as the Mormon church.

JD Vance describes his yearslong friendship with Kirk
Vice President JD Vance noted late Wednesday that Kirk advocated "in public and private" for President Trump to pick him as his running mate last year, following what Vance described as an eight-year-long friendship between the vice president and the conservative commentator.Vance said he first interacted with Kirk in 2017, when he sent Vance a complimentary message on Twitter following an appearance on Fox News' "Tucker Carlson Tonight." The vice president noted that both he and Kirk were initially Trump "skeptics" before becoming vociferous supporters.The vice president said Kirk was "one of the first people I called" when Vance mulled a run in Ohio's 2022 Senate race, a campaign that vaulted him into elected politics. During that campaign, he said Kirk introduced him to Donald Trump Jr., a close Kirk ally.Kirk and Vance remained in close contact after that, including during the 2024 campaign, the vice president said. He praised Turning Point USA's role in organizing pro-Trump events last year and credited Kirk with some of the Trump administration's personnel decisions."So much of the success we've had in this administration traces directly to Charlie's ability to organize and convene," Vance wrote. "He didn't just help us win in 2024, he helped us staff the entire government."

"This kind of rhetoric is directly responsible for the terrorism that we're seeing in our country today, and it must stop right now."The motive for the shooting remains unclear. Police have not identified a suspect, and authorities in Utah said earlier Wednesday they are looking for the perpetrator.Mr. Trump said his administration "will find each and every one of those who contributed to this atrocity, and to other political violence, including the organizations that fund it and support it."The president listed off several other instances of violence, including last year's assassination attempt against him in Pennsylvania, the 2017 shooting that wounded Republican Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana and the deadly December shooting of UnitedHealthcare's CEO.Mr. Trump did not mention several other recent acts of political violence that targeted Democratic officials. Nancy Pelosi's husband was attacked at home in 2022. And earlier this year, a Minnesota state lawmaker and her husband were fatally shot, and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro's residence faced an arson attack.

Trent Nelson/The Salt Lake Tribune via Reuters
Kirk's death comes as the nation has confronted a rash of political violence in recent years, including two assassination attempts against Mr. Trump last year and an attack on Paul Pelosi, the husband of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, in 2022. A man was arrested outside the Maryland home of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh armed with a gun, knife and various tools after the leak of a draft Supreme Court opinion overturning Roe v. Wade in 2022. The man was charged with attempting to murder a Supreme Court justice, and he pleaded guilty in April.Jury selection began this week in the trial of Ryan Routh, the man charged with attempting to assassinate Mr. Trump last year in South Florida, while he was a candidate for president. Routh pleaded not guilty to charges of attempting to assassinate a major presidential candidate, assaulting a federal officer and firearms violations. Gabby Giffords, a former congresswoman from Arizona was shot in the head during a constituent event in 2011, said she was "horrified" by the shooting."Democratic societies will always have political disagreements, but we must never allow America to become a country that confronts those disagreements with violence," she said on X.
