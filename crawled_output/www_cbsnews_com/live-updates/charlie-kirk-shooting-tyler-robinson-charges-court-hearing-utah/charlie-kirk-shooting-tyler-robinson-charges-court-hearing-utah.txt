Court hoping to secure legal representation for Robinson by end of week, county attorney says
Part of the reason Robinson does not yet have an attorney is because public defenders do not handle capital cases in Utah County, an attorney for the county told CBS News.Attorney Greg Skordas, who was part of Robinson's court initial appearance on Tuesday but does not represent the suspect, is working for Utah County to find a lawyer for Robinson. Skordas said he has been conducting a search since last week and had originally hoped to have Robinson's attorneys finalized by 3 p.m. Tuesday. He has narrowed the field to three or four firms and now expects the process to be completed by the end of this week, he said.Skordas said the county will likely contract with two law firms and set parameters on attorneys' hourly rates and determine budgets for private investigators, expert witnesses and other legal costs that would be incurred in Robinson's defense.

Graf also reiterated Robinson's right to remain silent and the possibility that anything Robinson said during Tuesday's hearing could be used against him in future court appearances.Aside from stating his name as "Tyler James Robinson" at the beginning, Robinson remained silent throughout the proceedings.

Robinson's parents recognized him in surveillance images, prosecutors say
Robinson's parents told police that they recognized their son in the images released by the FBI on Thursday, Sept. 11, the day after the shooting, Utah County Attorney Jeff Gray said. Officials say Robinson's mother told police that she saw the photo and thought it resembled her son. She called him and asked where he was. He said he was home sick, and had also been sick the day before. According to Gray, Robinson's mother told his father that she was concerned their son had been the shooter. Robinson's father agreed that the suspect looked like Robinson, and said that the gun that police were describing matched a rifle that was given to Robinson as a gift. He texted his son to ask for a photo of the rifle, but got no response. Robinson's father did speak to him on the phone, Gray said, and Robinson implied he would take his own life, but his parents were able to convince him to meet them at their home. During a conversation there, Gray said Robinson implied he was the shooter. They talked about turning himself in and convinced Robinson to speak with a family friend who is a retired deputy sheriff. The parents and friend were able to convince Robinson to turn himself in, Gray said. The family friend also urged Robinson to bring all available evidence to the police station to prevent a search warrant from being served at his parents' house.

In a text exchange with his roommate after the shooting, prosecutors say Robinson expressed concern about being unable to retrieve the rifle he had hidden after leaving the scene of the shooting because police had cordoned off the area."I'm worried what my old man would do if I didn't bring back grandpa's rifle," he allegedly wrote."I might have to abandon it and hope they don't find prints," he continued, according to Utah County Attorney Jeff Gray. "How the 'f' will I explain losing it to my old man?"

That relationship resulted in difficult conversations between Robinson and his family members, especially his father, who had different beliefs, Gray said.In one of those conversations, the Utah Attorney General continued, Robinson mentioned that Kirk would be holding an event at UVU.

Tyler Robinson charged with aggravated murder, could face death penalty
Utah County Attorney Jeff Gray charged Tyler Robinson on Tuesday with aggravated murder, felony discharge of a firearm, two counts of obstruction of justice, two counts of witness tampering, and committing a violent offense in the presence of a child.The first two counts come with aggravating factors because the state believes Robinson targeted Kirk because of his political beliefs, and knowing that children were present and would witness the shooting.The obstruction of justice charges were based on Robinson's efforts to hide evidence from the shooting, Gray said. The witness tampering charges refer to Robinson allegedly telling his roommate to delete texts and not talk to officials, Gray said.Gray said he filed a notice of intent to seek the death penalty in the case.Robinson will continue to be held without bail, Gray said.

Patel addresses post about "subject" in Kirk shooting
The Senate Judiciary Committee asked FBI director Kash
Patel on Tuesday about his decision to announce on X — hours after Kirk was killed — that "the subject for the horrific shooting today that took the life of Charlie Kirk is now in custody."The statement sparked confusion, since law enforcement on the ground in Utah said no suspect had been apprehended. Patel later issued a follow-up post saying the subject had been released.Patel stood by the comments on Tuesday, saying that the FBI doesn't only identify "suspects" but also interviews and eliminates "subjects" in investigations."What we had at the time was a subject in custody in relation to this investigation," Patel said. "So in my commitment to work with the public to help identify subjects and suspects, I put that information out. And then when we interviewed him, I put out the results of that. And could I have been more careful in my verbiage and included 'a subject' instead of 'subject?' Sure."When Sen. Peter Welch of Vermont said Patel's handling of the situation "was a mistake," the FBI director disagreed."I don't see it as a mistake," Patel said. "I see it as something, working with the public to identify that there was a subject in custody."

Patel says FBI is investigating Discord chat
FBI director Kash Patel faced questions about the investigation in Kirk's killing while testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday.Patel told Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri that the FBI is looking into a group chat on the messaging platform Discord that included the suspect in Kirk's killing. Patel said the FBI is working to preserve the contents of the chat."Unfortunately, it has been leaked that there was a Discord chat ... that the suspect participated in. So what we're doing, we've already done is sort of the legal process, not just on Discord, so that the information we gathered is sustained and held in an evidentiary posture that we could use in prosecution should we decide to do so," he said. "And we're also going to be investigating anyone and everyone involved in that Discord chat."Patel said there were a "lot more" than 20 users involved in the chat.

Suspect appeared to confess to killing on Discord, company says
Tyler Robinson appeared to take responsibility for shooting Charlie Kirk in messages sent to friends on the chat platform Discord, a company spokesperson said. "Hey guys, I have bad news for you all," read a message from an account that allegedly belonged to Robinson, according to the spokesperson and a law enforcement source. "It was me at UVU yesterday. im sorry for all of this." Members of the chat also recognized Robinson in images released by the FBI and asked if he was the shooter, according to the law enforcement source. Robinson did not seem to refute the question. In one exchange, the sources said a friend appeared to tease Robinson by quipping that he should avoid McDonald's — where accused UnitedHealthcare CEO shooter Luigi Mangione was caught with a manifesto, a gun and a fake ID late last year.The account appearing to belong to Robinson responded: "Better also get rid of this manifesto and exact copy rifle I have lying around."The messages, first reported by the Washington Post, were sent toward the end of the manhunt that ended with Robinson in custody late Thursday, Sept. 11. Read more here.
