Charlie Kirk's assassination was an attack on the U.S., Trump says
President Trump delivered the most overtly political speech of Charlie Kirk's memorial, teasing an upcoming autism related announcement, criticizing his political opponents and again blaming "the radical left" for Kirk's assassination."Charlie's murder was not just an attack on one man or one movement. It was an attack on our entire nation," Mr. Trump said. "The gun was pointed at him, but the bullet was aimed at all of us.""Charlie was killed for expressing the very ideas that virtually everyone in this arena and most other places throughout our country deeply believed in," the president said. "The assassin failed because Charlie's message has not been silenced, but it now is bigger and better and stronger than ever before."

Erika Kirk, Charlie Kirk's widow and the new CEO of Turning Point USA, said she has never found as much comfort in her faith as she has following her husband's assassination — even as she had to witness his lifeless body."I saw the wound that ended his life. I felt everything that you would expect to feel," Erika Kirk said. "I felt a level of heartache that I didn't know existed, but there was something else, too. Even in death, I could see the man that I loved.""I also saw on his lips the faintest smile. And that told me something important. It revealed to me a great mercy from God from this tragedy. When I saw that, it told me Charlie didn't suffer," she said.Erika Kirk was visibly emotional and empowered as she delivered her eulogy, touching on her husband's role not just in politics but in their family and most frequently as a Christian man. Toward the end of her speech, she proclaimed about her husband's alleged killer, "I forgive him."

Vice President JD Vance remembers Charlie Kirk as "a dear friend"
Vice President JD Vance remembered Charlie Kirk as someone who acted the same way even when the cameras weren't on."Charlie treated staffers as well as he treated the president of the United States," Vance said. "When I was just a guy polling at nothing in my Senate race back in 2021, Charlie helped me, not because I was a future vice president but because I was a dear friend.""Because Charlie believed that we are all children of God, he treated everyone with grace. And that, perhaps, is the enduring legacy of Charlie Kirk," he said.

Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. recalled that one of the first conversations he had with Charlie Kirk in July 2021 was about the physical risks they take in their positions."He asked me if I was scared of dying," RFK Jr. said. "And I said to him, 'There's a lot of worse things than death, and one of those things is if we lost our constitutional right in this country and that our children were raised as slaves.'"The health secretary said he told Kirk that "sometimes the best consolation we can hope for is that we get to die with our boots on.""Charlie died with his boots on, and he died to make sure that we didn't have to undergo those fates that are worse than death."

"Free speech is a foundation to our democratic republic. We must protect it at all costs because without it we'll be lost. Charlie knew this."

Republican Rep. Anna Paulina Luna of Florida began her memorial speech by saying she would not be in Congress without Charlie Kirk. Luna said she decided against going to medical school to become the director of Hispanic outreach for Turning Point USA in 2018 because she was inspired by Kirk's patriotism."He didn't just speak of patriotism. He lived it," she said. "Giving everything to ignite a movement that turned the tide for conservatism, empowering young voices to challenge the status quo and to secure a brighter future for America.""If one man can awaken a generation and save a nation, imagine what ten thousand can do," Luna said. "And we are all Charlie Kirk now, and his legacy has just begun."

Speaking at Kirk's memorial, former Turning Point USA COO Tyler Bowyer recalled meeting Kirk in 2014, remembering the conservative activist as "just a kid" who "shared a vision of what the conservative movement should be.""When Charlie turned 21, he didn't have a home. Turning Point USA was in its first year of raising real money," Bowyer said. "He was rarely home in Chicago. He lived on a plane and zipped back and forth as Turning Point USA became his life."Bowyer said he was the person who convinced Kirk to move to Arizona. That's where Kirk met his wife Erika, who Bowyer said wanted to help out at the first Trump rally in 2015."I wanted to hire her. I only had one problem, Charlie Kirk wanted to date her," Bowyer told the crowd. "They immediately fell in love and I lost an employee. But now she's my boss."The board of Turning Point USA named Erika Kirk as CEO last week. She is also serving as the chair of the board.

Erika Kirk tells New York Times that she insisted on seeing her husband in the hospital: "I want to see what they did to my husband"
In an interview with The New York Times that was published Sunday, Charlie Kirk's widow Erika Kirk, said that when she arrived at the Utah hospital after he was shot, she was warned against seeing his body. But, she said she told officials, "I want to see what they did to my husband.""His eyes were semi-open," Kirk told the Times. "And he had this knowing, Mona Lisa-like half-smile. Like he'd died happy. Like Jesus rescued him. The bullet came, he blinked, and he was in heaven."She said she had not kissed him before he left that morning, and she kissed him then.Erika Kirk told the Times about how she and Charlie met and their relationship. "I'm not saying he was perfect, by any means," she said. "But I knew my expectations and role, and he knew his. I wasn't going to be the nagging wife who he wouldn't want to come home to. I wanted to create a sacred landing space for him. And I think that's why he was always eager to come home."Erika Kirk also said she did not want to be the one who decided if the alleged shooter got the death penalty. "I'll be honest. I told our lawyer, I want the government to decide this. I do not want that man's blood on my ledger," she said. "Because when I get to heaven, and Jesus is like: 'Uh, eye for an eye? Is that how we do it?' And that keeps me from being in heaven, from being with Charlie?"

Tight security at Arizona's State Farm Stadium, where memorial service is being held
The memorial service for Charlie Kirk is taking place at State Farm Stadium —  normally home to the NFL's Arizona Cardinals. The stadium, which is located in Glendale, near Phoenix, can seat more than 63,000 people. But police are anticipating that more than 100,000 people may turn out, so Kirk's organization, Turning Point USA, also reserved the venue next door, the Desert Diamond Arena, for overflow. Desert Diamond seats about 18,000.Organizers said there would be tight security for the event, with "TSA-level screening" for the crowd. Federal authorities have designated the memorial service as a Special Event Assessment Rating (SEAR) Level 1 event, a senior Department of Homeland Security official said. That designation is used for "significant events with national and/or international importance that require extensive federal interagency support," like the Super Bowl.Read more here.By Joe Walsh, Nicole Sganga

At Turning Point USA, Kirk built a movement and stirred controversy
Charlie Kirk was the leader of Turning Point USA, a group for young conservatives that he co-founded in 2012, at the age of 18. A native of the Chicago area, Kirk briefly attended community college but dropped out to pursue political activism full-time.He was an outspoken and ubiquitous presence in politics, especially for the younger set. He hosted a daily talk radio show and podcast, spread his message on social media and visited scores of college campuses every year, where he was known for hosting rapid-fire debates with left-leaning students. Kirk frequently drew controversy for his views. He supported Mr. Trump's false claims of voter fraud after the 2020 election, and his group maintained a "Professor Watchlist" of college instructors accused of spreading "leftist propaganda."He espoused anti-trans rhetoric and amplified the "Great Replacement" conspiracy, the claim that there's a plot to replace White people with minorities. Turning Point USA, a nonprofit, says it has chapters at thousands of high schools and colleges, and the group's political arm, Turning Point Action, engages in grassroots canvassing.

Charlie Kirk's close ties with Trump and Vance
Kirk's support for President Trump dates back to his first campaign in 2016, and he remained allied with Mr. Trump after he left office under a cloud of controversy following the Capitol riot in January 2021. In the 2024 presidential race, Kirk's organization, Turning Point USA, was widely credited with helping to energize and mobilize young conservative voters for Mr. Trump.

Kirk also grew close with Donald Trump Jr. after serving as an aide in the 2016 campaign. "Charlie wasn't just a friend — he was like a little brother to me," Trump Jr. wrote on X.Vice President JD Vance has credited Kirk with introducing him to Donald Trump Jr. before Vance ran for Senate in 2022, and with advocating "in public and private" for the president to choose Vance as his running mate last year. Following Kirk's assassination, Vance accompanied Kirk's casket as it was flown from Utah to Arizona aboard the vice president's plane, Air Force Two.
