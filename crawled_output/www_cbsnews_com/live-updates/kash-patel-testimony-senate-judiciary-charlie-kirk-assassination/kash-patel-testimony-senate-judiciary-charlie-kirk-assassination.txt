FBI Director Kash Patel faces tough questions from Senate Democrats
02:27
What to know about Kash Patel's testimony:FBI Director Kash Patel testified Tuesday for more than four and a half hours before the Senate Judiciary Committee, where he faced tough questions about his leadership of the bureau, including the ouster of top officials and his handling of the investigation into the assassination of Charlie Kirk.Patel has come under fire for his social media posts in the aftermath of Kirk's killing last week. Patel sparked confusion when he announced a "subject" of the shooting was in custody and later released before the suspected gunman was apprehended.At the hearing, the director confirmed that the bureau is investigating a group chat on the platform Discord that the suspect, Tyler Robinson, was allegedly involved in. CBS News reported Monday that Robinson appeared to confess to the killing in the chat before he was taken into custody.Patel touted the FBI's role in fighting crime and defended his personnel moves, saying they have been "based on merit and qualification." Democrats contested that assertion, accusing Patel of targeting agents and officials because of their involvement in investigations into President Trump.The FBI director also fielded questions about the Justice Department's handling of files related to Jeffrey Epstein. He said nothing in the department's files indicated that others were involved in Epstein's trafficking of minors.

Patel calls Schiff a "buffoon" and "fraud" in heated exchange over Epstein files
A heated exchange erupted between Sen. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, and Patel when Schiff questioned Patel about FBI terminations and the Epstein files. Schiff asked whether Patel ever terminated or disciplined an FBI employee because they were assigned to or worked on an investigation into Mr. Trump or the Jan. 6, 2021, attack. As Patel reiterated his earlier response about the parameters surrounding FBI terminations, Schiff demanded a yes or no response. "I don't have to answer your question yes or no because you're setting up a trap," Patel said. The exchange grew more heated when Schiff questioned Patel about the Epstein files, asking about Epstein co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell being moved to a lower-security prison after she was interviewed by the deputy attorney general. Patel said the Bureau of Prisons made the decision. "You want the American people to believe that? Do you think they're stupid?" Schiff said. Patel responded, "No, I think the American people believe the truth, that I'm not in the weeds on the everyday movements of inmates." The two men then began yelling over each other. The FBI director alleged that "we have countlessly proven you to be a liar in Russiagate, in Jan. 6." "You are the biggest fraud to ever sit in the United States Senate. You are a disgrace to this institution and an utter coward," Patel said, adding that "you are a political buffoon at best."Schiff replied that "the FBI director will always be nothing more than an internet troll."

Patel on post about "subject" in Kirk shooting: "I don't see it as a mistake"
FBI Director Kash Patel testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., on Sept. 16, 2025.

Patel was asked about his decision to announce on X hours after Kirk was shot that a "subject" was in custody. Patel's initial statement sparked confusion, since law enforcement on the ground in Utah said no suspected gunman had been apprehended. He later issued a follow-up post saying the subject had been released.On Tuesday, Patel stood by his post, saying the FBI doesn't only identify "suspects," but also interviews and eliminates "subjects" of investigations. "What we had at the time was a subject in custody in relation to this investigation," Patel said. "So in my commitment to work with the public to help identify subjects and suspects, I put that information out. And then when we interviewed him, I put out the results of that. And could I have been more careful in my verbiage and included 'a subject' instead of 'subject?' Sure."Sen. Peter Welch of Vermont asserted that Patel's handling of the situation "was a mistake." Patel disagreed. "I don't see it as a mistake," Patel said. "I see it as something, working with the public to identify that there was a subject in custody."

Cruz questions Patel about details of Kirk investigation
Cruz questioned Patel about details surrounding the assassination of Kirk, zeroing in on the suspected shooter. Patel said "we've interviewed numerous people, family and friends, including the partner, to provide us with a detailed history of the knowledge he may have had — the suspect may have had — prior to" the shooting."We are still mapping out who, if anyone, was involved as an accomplice," Patel said. "As I said, the investigation is ongoing."Cruz asked whether it was accurate "that the assassin's roommate was a transgender man who was transitioning to be female" and that "they may have been romantic partners." Patel said yes.The Texas Republican also asked whether there were "chatrooms of transgender activists that indicated some degree of, potentially a foreknowledge, of this murder." Patel said "we're still developing that."Asked by Cruz about the bullet casings and the source of the engravings on them, Patel said "as to the actual source, we're still developing that."Cruz encouraged Patel to "go after anyone who aided and abetted." But he added, "I want to more broadly encourage you — follow the money.""The violence we are seeing is not purely organic," Cruz said. "There is, I believe significant money that is spreading dissension that is spreading violence."

Booker and Patel get into shouting match: "I don't think you're long for your job"
Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey questions FBI Director Kash Patel during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on oversight of the FBI at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., on Sept. 16, 2025.

After criticizing Patel's handling of the Kirk shooting investigation, the Epstein files, the removal of FBI agents and other matters, Booker said he doesn't think the president will keep Patel around long. "Here's the thing, Mr. Patel," Booker said. "I think you're not going to be around long. I think this might be your last oversight hearing. Because as much as you supplicate yourself to the will of Donald Trump and not the Constitution of the United States of America, Donald Trump has shown us in his first term and this term, he is not loyal to people like you. He will cut you loose. This may be the last time I have a hearing with you because I don't think you're long for your job. But I'm going to tell you this. I pray for you. I pray for you, that you can step up and defend your oath, defend the Constitution and do a much better job of defending this country." Grassley, the chairman, gave Patel a chance to respond. "That rant of false information does not bring this country together," Patel said, before Booker tried to interject. Patel said, "It's my time, not yours." "My God! My God! You're going to talk to me about dividing this country? I follow you on your social media posts that tear this country apart," Booker said, as Patel continued to try to speak. Their exchange devolved into chaotic shouting."You are an embarrassment to the division of this country!" Patel said, telling Booker, "your time is over."  "Sir, you don't tell me my time is over! The people of New Jersey tell me when my time is — you can't lecture me!" Booker yelled. "I'm not going anywhere!" Patel yelled.  "I am not afraid of you!" Booker replied. Grassley exercised his gavel to bring the committee to order. GOP Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas chimed in afterward, saying, "it used to be that to see theater you had to go to the Kennedy Center. Now apparently you need only go to the Senate Judiciary Committee."

Patel says there's "no credible information" in Epstein files that he trafficked minors to others
Kennedy asked Patel about the Epstein files, outlining that the "central question for the American people is this: they know that Epstein trafficked young women for sex to himself… they want to know who, if anyone else, he trafficked these young women to." The Louisiana Republican called it a "very fair question" that he himself wanted an answer to."Who, if anyone, did Epstein traffic these young women to, besides himself?" Kennedy asked. "Himself," Patel responded. "There is no credible information — none, if there were I would bring the case yesterday — that he trafficked to other individuals. And the information we have, again, is limited.""So the answer is no one?" Kennedy clarified. "For the information that we have," Patel responded. "In the files?" Kennedy asked. "In the case file," Patel confirmed. Kennedy encouraged Patel to release the files, saying "this issue is not going to go away."Patel went on to explain that the case file he was referring to was the evidence gathered in the earlier investigation into Epstein that resulted in a nonprosecution agreement in 2008. He said the decision not to fully investigate the allegations against him then "hamstrung future investigations." "Now I am not saying that others were not trafficked, that others were not involved. What I am telling you is that based on the information we have — and we have continuously and publicly asked for the public to come forward with more information, if there is, we'll look at it — but based on credible information, we have released all credible information, and the information that the Department of Justice and the FBI never releases is information on investigations that are not credible."He said that "the information we are releasing now is historic and it is also to the maximum capacity that the law allows." "I know that's not going to satisfy many, many, many people, but if they wanted it done right, then the investigation from its origination should have been done right and he should not have been given a get-out-of-jail-free card," Patel said.

Former FBI official says latest attacks on houses of worship have been carried out by "lone wolf" types
A former FBI official took issue with Patel's remarks that the bureau would "follow the money" in  investigations of attacks on houses of worship."The director said they will 'follow the money' when investigating attacks on houses of worship — this suggests conspiracies are behind attacks on houses of worship," the former official said. "The recent history of attacks have overwhelmingly been conducted by 'lone wolf' types without participation or the knowledge of others."Under questioning by GOP Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri about whether the FBI was investigating whether domestic terror cells are behind attacks on churches or houses of worship, Patel replied, "I've always said we follow the money. And whether it's terrorism or attacks based on ideology or attacks on institutions of faith or people of faith, someone's paying for it, and we are reverse tracing those steps. We are not stopping at the perpetrator themselves. We are reverse engineering to hold those accountable in our investigations to who funded them and knowingly funded them. And we will bring the appropriate steps against them with our partners at DOJ."

Kennedy asks Patel whether others were involved in Kirk assassination
Sen. John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican, asked Patel about Kirk's assassination, including whether the shooter acted alone.Patel said "it is very much an ongoing investigation." And he added that "there are a number of individuals that are currently being investigated and interrogated and a number yet to be instigated and interrogated, specific to that chatroom," referring to the Discord group that the suspect was involved in."So we are very much in our ongoing posture of investigation," Patel said. "So others could have been involved?" Kennedy asked. "Yes, sir," Patel said.

Patel says FBI is investigating Discord chat that included suspected Kirk shooter
Patel told Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri that the FBI is looking into a group chat on the messaging platform Discord that included the suspect in Kirk's killing. Hours before Tyler Robinson was arrested, the 22-year-old appeared to take responsibility for the shooting in a message to the group, CBS News reported on Monday. Patel said the FBI is working to preserve the contents of the chat. "Unfortunately, it has been leaked that there was a Discord chat … that the suspect participated in. So what we're doing, we've already done is sort of the legal process, not just on Discord, so that the information we gathered is sustained and held in an evidentiary posture that we could use in prosecution should we decide to do so," he said. "And we're also going to be investigating anyone and everyone involved in that Discord chat."Patel said there were a "lot more" than 20 users involved in the chat.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat, questioned Patel about how to prevent gun deaths in the country, citing the recent shooting at a Catholic school in Minnesota and the targeted shooting of former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, along with other mass shootings and Kirk's killing. Klobuchar asked whether an assault weapon ban would be helpful in reducing gun deaths.Patel said: "Minnesota has suffered untold tragedy in these last few months, and whatever creativity we can use to eliminate even just one shooting, one horrific death, I am in favor of engaging with Congress fully to do."Pressed by Klobuchar on the assault weapon ban question, Patel said "there are instances on this legislation that could prevent future attacks, but I'm not going to weigh into the creation of legislation."The FBI director also said the bureau is trying to process background checks faster.

Patel said "morale when I travel around the country, in my experience, has never been higher.""The FBI and police officers that we work hand in glove with across this country are excited to do the work," he said. On counterintelligence, Cornyn asked about the FBI's role. Patel said "the espionage activities of our adversaries have never been so high." But he argued that the counterintelligence mission is "properly housed" within the bureau, saying "I believe that mission set is working."

Former FBI special agent criticizes Patel for taking credit for drop in murder rate
A former FBI special agent who's watching Patel's testimony criticized him for taking credit for the drop in the national murder rate.  "No FBI Director should be touting a drop in the national murder rate and then take credit for the drop," the former FBI special agent said. "Better than 99% of all murders are local in origin, not federal. Most murders are the result of domestic (family) violence, gang violence, robbery homicides, etc. Whatever has caused state/local homicides to drop, it's not the result of federal law enforcement efforts."  Patel told the committee that "one of the stats that the American people should thank the FBI for is, we are on track to have the lowest murder rate in modern American history."

Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat, questioned Patel about a so-called "enemies list" that he prepared before taking office, alleging that there had been "adverse actions of various kinds taken against about 20 of the 60 people on your enemies list." The names were part of a glossary in Patel's 2023 book, "Government Gangsters," and came up during his confirmation hearing earlier this year.Patel refuted the claim, calling it "entirely inaccurate" and saying "I do not have an enemies list.""The only actions we take, generally speaking, for personnel at the FBI are ones based on merit and qualification, and your ability to uphold your constitutional duty," Patel said. "You fall short, you don't work there anymore."

Patel says FBI is working to unseal the search warrant for John Bolton's home
In an exchange with Graham about the FBI raid of former national security adviser John Bolton's home last month, Patel said the FBI is working to unseal the search warrant that authorized the raid. "We're looking to have that search warrant unsealed," Patel said, which Graham said would be "quite good." Graham asked Patel if there was new evidence that led to the warrant. Patel said the investigation is "ongoing" so he couldn't reveal more information. Bolton, who worked for Mr. Trump during his first term, is an outspoken critic of the president.

Patel said "from my perch, we will provide the intelligence necessary for anyone who meets the threshold to be a state sponsor of terrorism."The South Carolina Republican also asked about China's role in the fentanyl problem in the U.S. Patel said the "precursors are the problem." Patel said China is "starting to help."

Patel objects to criticism of him and Bongino as "disgusting"
Watch: Kash Patel, Sen. Dick Durbin get into testy exchange at Senate hearing
10:02
In a testy exchange with Durbin, Patel said he finds it "disgusting" that anyone would question or criticize the 31 years of law enforcement-related experience he said he and Deputy FBI Director Dan Bongino share between them. "Director Patel, much like you, Deputy Director Dan Bongino was a conspiracy theorist who built a lucrative career making inflammatory and unsubstantiated statements about the FBI that would be disqualifying in any administration that cared about nonpartisan law enforcement," Durbin said. "For instance, Mr. Bongino called the placement of pipe bombs outside the DNC and RNC headquarters on Jan. 6, quote, 'an inside job.'"Bongino is a former police officer and Secret Service agent who was a conservative commentator and podcaster when he was tapped to be the second-in-command at the FBI. Earlier in his career, Patel worked at the Justice Department before stints on Capitol Hill, the National Security Council and Pentagon during the first Trump administration.Patel was asked if he also thought the pipe bombs were an "inside job." Patel said it's "disgusting" that so many in the media and on the committee are trying to "jettison" his and Bongino's "31 years of public service.""You're questioning the integrity of the deputy director and mine," Patel said.

Patel says FBI will continue to use polygraphs to track down leakers
Durbin, citing reports, said about 40 FBI officials have been asked to sit for polygraphs, and some have been asked if they've said anything about Patel. The New York Times reported in July that "the F.B.I. has asked senior employees whether they have said anything negative about Mr. Patel," citing anonymous sources.Durbin asked what the basis is for requiring polygraphs. "I don't know what reports you're referring to, ranking member, and I reject any reporting that has false information in it so I'm not going to respond to that," Patel responded. "As far as polygraphs go, generally they're always and always have been utilized at the FBI to track down those that leak sensitive information and unauthorized disclosures to the media, and we will continue to use them to ensure the integrity of the FBI." Patel declined to get into "private discussions" about polygraphs.

Patel said he would commit to providing "all records I am legally permitted to do so under the court orders."The Iowa Republican also asked Patel about records that he said allegedly prove a Biden family bribery scheme, asking whether Wray made any efforts to obtain those records. Patel said to his knowledge, the former FBI director had not. Grassley said the FBI has an "obligation to the public" to determine why it wasn't investigated.

Patel says handling of earlier federal probe was "original sin" of Epstein case
Patel said a federal investigation into Jeffrey Epstein that began in 2006 was the "original sin" of how the government has handled the case, as the FBI and Justice Department face scrutiny from Trump allies and Democrats alike over the administration's handling of records about the late sex offender. The earlier investigation ended with a secret nonprosecution agreement in 2008 negotiated by then-U.S. Attorney Alexander Acosta, which shielded Epstein from federal charges if he agreed to plead guilty to state prostitution crimes in Florida. "I'm here to testify that the original sin in the Epstein case was the way it was initially brought by Mr. Acosta back in 2006," Patel said. "The original case involved a very limited search warrant or set of search warrants, and didn't take as much investigative material it should have seized. If I were the FBI director then, it wouldn't have happened. The search warrants were limited to small time periods to include 2002-2005 and 1997-2001.""Mr. Acosta allowed Epstein to enter in 2008 to a plea and nonprosecution agreement, which then the courts issued mandates and protective orders legally prohibiting anyone from seeing that material ever again without the permission of the court," Patel continued. "The nonprosecution agreements also barred future prosecutions, for those involved at that time, of those individuals. Still, this administration at the direction of President Trump has done more to turn over all the credible information we are legally able to do so, and we will continue to work with Congress to achieve that end."

Patel outlines work of FBI under Trump administration
Patel outlined the FBI's work under the Trump administration more broadly, saying the bureau has arrested more than 23,000 violent criminals and taken over 6,000 illegal firearms off the streets. He said agents have identified and located more than 4,700 child victims and arrested 1,500 child predators and 300 human traffickers. Patel said over 350 members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua have also been arrested. "Those are just some of the things the FBI is doing differently and better, because we are leading the missing to crush violent crime and defend the homeland," Patel said. The FBI director said that "one of the stats that the American people should thank the FBI for is, we are on track to have the lowest murder rate in modern American history."Patel said "there has been a drastic reduction in crime across the board in mid-major cities across the country, thanks to the men and women of the FBI," pointing to a crackdown on drugs. Patel also said the bureau has made over 60 counterintelligence arrests this year. "I want the American people to know, the FBI's protecting the homeland from foreign adversaries in a way that will never make the news, and a lot of the good work they do will never be able to be discussed in this setting," Patel said.

Patel is sworn in, says FBI's release of video of Kirk shooter was key to arrest
After he was sworn in, Patel began his statement by giving a timeline of Kirk's killing and the FBI's involvement. He said the FBI's release of surveillance footage showing the suspected shooter was instrumental in taking Tyler Robinson into custody the day after Kirk's death."A few hours later, that suspect was in custody, pursuant to the interrogation of the suspect's own father, who stated, 'When I saw that video that you released, I recognized it was my son. And I confronted him,'" Patel said. "And he was handed over to lawful law enforcement authorities."Patel said that is a demonstration of the FBI being "transparent." The FBI director said the bureau received over 11,000 tips in the first 24 hours alone.

Durbin calls Patel "arguably the most partisan FBI director ever"
Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, called Patel "arguably the most partisan FBI director ever" and alleged he has "attacked the FBI with a vengeance."In his opening statement, Durbin criticized Patel's handling of the Kirk assassination. Hours after the shooting, Patel announced on social media a "subject" was in custody, even as state officials said they were still looking for the suspected shooter. Patel later posted on X that the subject had been released."Mr. Patel was so anxious to take credit for finding Mr. Kirk's assassin, that he violated one of the basics of effective law enforcement: at critical stages of an investigation, shut up and let the professionals do their job," Durbin said.Durbin also addressed the "purge" of FBI staff since President Trump returned to office."As we heard from highly credible whistleblowers, Mr. Patel was involved in directing this purge even before he was confirmed, despite his sworn testimony to this committee," Durbin said, adding that at least 18 of 53 special agents in charge, the top agents in FBI field offices, have been ousted.

Grassley gavels in hearing, says Patel inherited FBI "infected with politics"
Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican who chairs the committee, gaveled the hearing in shortly after 9 a.m. "We meet today in the aftermath of the political assassination of Charlie Kirk, a school shooting in the senseless murder of Ukrainian refugees, and also to remember, several weeks ago, the killings in Minnesota," Grassley said.  Grassley said he's asked Patel to provide an update on the Kirk assassination during the hearing. The Iowa Republican praised Patel for the "important work" of returning the FBI to a "law-enforcement mission." He compared Patel's work to that of former Director Christopher Wray, saying "it's well understood that your predecessor left you an FBI infected with politics."

Patel likely to face questions about his handling of the Charlie Kirk shooter investigation
Hours after Kirk was shot and killed at Utah Valley University on Wednesday, Patel announced on social media at 6:21 p.m. ET that the "subject for the horrific shooting today that took the life of Charlie Kirk is now in custody." Moments after that, Beau Mason, the head of Utah's Department of Public Safety, told reporters authorities would be working around the clock to find Kirk's killer. About 90 minutes after his initial post, Patel posted that the subject had been released, and Kirk's killer was still at large. But the disparity between Patel's initial post and what law enforcement were saying in Utah sparked confusion. Ultimately, authorities said the father of the suspect was the one who encouraged him to turn himself in, after recognizing his son in photos released by the FBI. The suspect in Kirk's killing was announced Friday morning. Patel's decision to fly to Utah ahead of the arrest announcement, as a law enforcement press conference was delayed, also came under scrutiny. Earlier this week, Patel defended his handling of the Kirk investigation."Could I have worded it a little better in the heat of the moment? Sure," he said on "Fox & Friends" on Monday. "But do I regret putting it out? Absolutely not. I was telling the world what the FBI was doing as we were doing and I'm continuing to do that."

What to know about Kash Patel
Patel, a longtime ally to President Trump, was narrowly confirmed by the Senate in February, facing opposition from all Democrats and two Republicans.The 45-year-old's career began as a public defender in Florida, before Patel went on to become a trial attorney in the Justice Department's National Security Division and a legal liaison to Joint Special Operations Command. In Mr. Trump's first administration, Patel served in intelligence and defense roles, and held a position on the National Security Council and as chief of staff to the secretary of defense.Patel came into the role after former FBI Director Chris Wray resigned at the end of the Biden administration as Mr. Trump pledged to fire him, though he had been nominated to a 10-year-term that was set to end in 2027. The FBI had long been a target of the president's ire, especially after FBI agents executed a court-authorized search warrant at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida.
