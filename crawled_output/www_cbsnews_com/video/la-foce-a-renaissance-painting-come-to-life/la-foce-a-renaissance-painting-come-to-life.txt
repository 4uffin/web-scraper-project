La Foce: A Renaissance painting come to life
The La Foce estate is the showpiece of one aristocratic family's generations-long effort to revitalize an area in Italy's Val d'Orcia region that was impoverished in the early 20th century. Seth Doane reports on how a farmer-entrepreneur helped remake the 7,000-acre estate, which is now a backdrop for weddings and film shoots.
