Doja Cat: "I'm very proud of the music I'm making now"
The 29-year-old Grammy-winner known as Doja Cat is once again mixing up her look and her sound. She talks with Michelle Miller about her new album, "Vie" (to be released Sept. 26); how she was inspired to create music while growing up in an ashram; and how this "rapper that makes pop music" doesn't cut herself a break.
