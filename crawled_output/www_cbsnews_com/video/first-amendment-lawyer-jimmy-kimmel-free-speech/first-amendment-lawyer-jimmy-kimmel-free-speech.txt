First Amendment lawyer on Jimmy Kimmel, the FCC and free speech
Sinclair and Nexstar say their ABC stations will continue to preempt "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" with local programming as the show returns to the network on Tuesday night. Kimmel was briefly pulled completely off the air over comments he made about Charlie Kirk's assassination. Bob Corn-Revere, chief counsel for the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression and former chief counsel to an interim chair of the FCC, joins CBS News with analysis.
