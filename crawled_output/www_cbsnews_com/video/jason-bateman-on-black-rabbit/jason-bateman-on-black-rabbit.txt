Jason Bateman on "Black Rabbit"
Jason Bateman has been acting since he was a child; he's since added director and podcaster to his résumé. Now, the Emmy Award-winner is starring with Jude Law in the Netflix series "Black Rabbit," playing brothers whose troubled relationship threatens to destroy more than just the restaurant they founded. Bateman talks with Lee Cowan about the appeal of directing; sobriety; and recording his podcast, "Smartless," with fellow actors Sean Hayes and Will Arnett.
