Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the Senate Intelligence Committee vice chairman, told "Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan" that the committee was not briefed ahead of President Trump's deadly strike on a Venezuelan boat that was allegedly carrying drugs. The mission was a military operation, but Warner said, "this kind of action should be briefed to the intelligence community."
