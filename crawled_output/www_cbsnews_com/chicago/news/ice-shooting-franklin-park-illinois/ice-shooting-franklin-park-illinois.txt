A U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent shot and killed a man in Franklin Park, Illinois Friday morning after authorities say he attempted to drive into agents.A Department of Homeland Security official first told CBS News the agent was trying to make an arrest, which the man resisted and tried to drive his vehicle into agents. The agent then opened fire.ICE officials confirmed the fatal shooting, saying the incident began with "targeted law enforcement activity.""During a vehicle stop, the suspect resisted and attempted to drive his vehicle into the arrest team, striking an officer and subsequently dragging him as he fled the scene. Fearing for his life, the officer discharged his firearm and struck the subject," the statement said.The incident ended when the undocumented driver crashed into a truck. The driver of the truck posted video on social media, where you can see a wrecked Subaru wedged under its trailer. You can also see two officers on the ground next to the undocumented driver.
ICE said both the agent and the suspect were taken to a local hospital for treatment, where the man died. ICE said the agent was dragged and suffered "severe injuries." The agent is being treated at a local hospital where his condition has stabilized, ICE said.

DHS officials identified the man shot and killed as Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez, who they said had a criminal history of reckless driving. They said he entered the country at an unknown date and time. The agent was dragged by the car and suffered "multiple injuries" according to DHS.  In surveillance video from a nail salon, ICE officers can be seen pulling up in a Jeep, with lights flashing, right in front of the Subaru driven by Villegas-Gonzalez. Agents walk over to the car. One goes to the passenger side window, the other to the driver's side window.
The officer on the passenger side, which is closer to the nail salon's cameras, appears to try to open the door. Then Villegas-Gonzalez starts backing up and drives away. You can still see the officer at the passenger's side window in the video; what you can't see is the agent who was at the driver's side window. That is the agent DHS said was dragged.Surveillance video from another nearby business shows the truck driving west down Grand Avenue then Villegas-Gonzalez, in the Subaru, change from the right to left lane. A short time later, two loud noises that sound like gunshots can be heard. Jose Pedro De Blas, who works at a nearby auto body shop, captured video of the scene right after the shooting and crash."I thought this was just a regular run-of-the-mill car crash," he said. "I go out and I see a large police presence. A large military presence. I even saw a guy with a large FBI jacket and you only see those at the movies."
"I think it's unfortunate right now that people from all over the world are running away from ICE, scared from ICE," he added. "I totally get their point, why they're running away."Villegas-Gonzalez's girlfriend, Blanca Mora, speaking through an interpreter, said she just wants the truth to come out, believing ICE is lying about the shooting.U.S. Rep. Chuy Garcia (D-IL), whose district includes Franklin Park, said he was "shocked" by Villegas-Gonzalez's death, and called for a full investigation of what led to the shooting, as well as the release of all surveillance camera and body camera video from the incident.
"This community is shocked, and they deserve to get the answers to the questions that are raised. Was there a warrant issued for his detention? Was there a basis for his being pulled over this morning? He had just dropped off two children at a local school," Garcia said. "The community needs to know the facts. The public needs to know what transpired."The FBI confirmed it has been informed of the situation and is helping with the investigation."The FBI is aware of the incident in Franklin Park and is assisting law enforcement in response," a spokesperson for the Chicago field office said. "There is no threat to public safety or further information available at this time."Gov. JB Pritzker posted to his X account, writing, "I am aware of the troubling incident that has unfolded in Franklin Park. This is a developing situation and the people of Illinois deserve a full, factual accounting of what's happened today to ensure transparency and accountability."The village of Franklin Park is about 15 miles northwest of Chicago, near O'Hare International Airport.Federal agents have been ramping up immigration enforcement activity all week as part of what the Trump administration is calling "Operation Midway Blitz."
