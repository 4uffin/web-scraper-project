Blood on bed sheets

Attorney Mike Jones

Room service records checked

In 2010, Mike Jones got his hands on Royal Caribbean's case file. Room service records do not show any order being delivered to the men last seen with George Smith that night. Mike Jones believes that their alibis don't hold up.
Lawyer Keith Greer

Provacative video

Jones learned of a potentially damaging videotape made by some of these men just hours after George disappeared. On the tape, Jones says the three Russian-Americans are seen and heard making callous remarks about George's death and at the end Greg Rozenberg says "I told you I was gangsta."
