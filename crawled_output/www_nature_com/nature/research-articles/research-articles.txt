Basal cell of origin resolves neuroendocrine–tuft lineage plasticity in cancer
Basal cells, rather than neuroendocrine cells, have been identified as the probable origin of small cell lung cancer and other neuroendocrine–tuft cancers, explaining neuroendocrine–tuft heterogeneity and offering new perspectives for targeting lineage plasticity.

CRISPR activation for SCN2A-related neurodevelopmental disorders
Using SCN2A haploinsufficiency as a proof-of-concept, upregulation of the existing functional gene copy through CRISPR activation was able to rescue neurological-associated phenotypes in Scn2a haploinsufficient mice and human neurons.

Analogue speech recognition based on physical computing
A temporal-signal processor based on two in-materia computing hardware platforms—reconfigurable nonlinear-processing units (RNPUs) and analogue in-memory computing (AIMC)—is used for both feature extraction and classification, advancing compactness, efficiency, and performance of heterogeneous smart edge devices.

Repeated head trauma causes neuron loss and inflammation in young athletes
Repetitive head impacts from contact sports are associated with brain inflammation, vascular damage and neuron loss that are independent of hyperphosphorylated tau pathology.

Toughened self-assembled monolayers for durable perovskite solar cells
Cross-linkable co-SAMs improve hole-selective SAM stability, preventing defects and thermal degredation in perovskite solar cells, enabling 26.92% efficiency with high heat durability, and guiding the design of more efficient and durable solar cells.

Transitions in dynamical regime and neural mode during perceptual decisions
Simultaneous recordings were made of hundreds of neurons in the rat frontal cortex and striatum, showing that decision commitment involves a rapid, coordinated transition in dynamical regime and neural mode.

A movable long-term implantable soft microfibre for dynamic bioelectronics
A soft, stretchable and freely movable fibre sensor called NeuroWorm, inspired by earthworms and that can be magnetically steered through soft tissue, is described as a new platform for dynamic bioelectrical and biomechanical monitoring.

Myeloperoxidase transforms chromatin into neutrophil extracellular traps
Myeloperoxidase, a highly expressed neutrophil protein, disassembles nucleosomes, facilitating neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation, and binds stably to NETs extracellularly.

A room temperature rechargeable all-solid-state hydride ion battery
A core-shell hydride 3CeH3@BaH2, which exhibits fast H− conduction at ambient temperature and becomes a superionic conductor above 60 °C, is used to construct an all-solid-state rechargeable H− battery.

Reduced Atlantic reef growth past 2 °C warming amplifies sea-level impacts
An analysis of coral reefs in the tropical western Atlantic suggests that nearly all will be eroding by 2100 if global warming exceeds 2 °C, which will worsen the effects of sea-level rise.
