Fossil fight: how Raymond Dart countered some unfair criticism
A letter to the editor sets the record straight regarding the discovery of Australopithecus, and a proposal to put food on the school curriculum in this week’s pick from the Nature archive

Caribbean coral reefs are threatened by rising seas
Modelling suggests that most Caribbean coral reefs will erode by the year 2100 as sea-level rise outpaces reef growth and limits potential reef restoration.

A surprising way to make heat in an unexpected part of fat cells
Organelles called peroxisomes have been found to have a role in heat generation in fat tissue, and use a mechanism independent of the known heat-producing protein UCP1. The process involves the synthesis and degradation of monomethyl branched-chain fatty acids, driven by the lipid-synthesizing enzyme FASN and the peroxisomal enzyme ACOX2.

A photonic chip enables ultrabroadband wireless communication
Future wireless networks should exploit the full range of telecommunications frequencies. A photonic chip that can reconfigure a broad range of frequencies enables dynamic, full-spectrum management of next-generation communications systems.

People are more likely to cheat when they delegate tasks to AI
Artificial intelligence is moving from being a mere tool to an active partner in decision-making, but when we offload misconduct to machines, who bears the blame?

AI can learn to show its workings through trial and error
Large language models (LLMs) are more accurate when they output intermediate steps. A strategy called reinforcement can teach them to do this without being told.

Bespoke 3D printing adapted to features mapped using computer vision
Conventional 3D printers do not extract information from their environment. A ‘context-aware’ volumetric printer uses light-sheet imaging and visual processing to map objects or living cells embedded in printable materials. This enables rapid, automated fabrication of designs adapted to mapped elements, such as vasculature precisely reaching the bioprinted cells.

Bioelectronic implants built from rolled-up stretchy circuits
Soft devices made by rolling up rubber-like sheets patterned with 2D electronics can monitor, stimulate and navigate deep tissue in animal models.

Earth’s atmosphere took two billion years to become fully oxygenated
High-resolution isotope data show that a modern-like, oxygen-rich atmosphere was not established until 410 million years ago, supporting a 2-billion-year transitional oxygenation of Earth’s surface. The record also captures a dynamic co-evolution of atmospheric and oceanic reduction–oxidation states, with repeated oxygenation pulses and feedback cycles.

Years of hits to the head prime the brain for decline
Repetitive head impacts trigger neuronal loss and disrupt blood vessels and immune cells long before the accumulation of neurotoxic tau protein.

Wired for growth: neuron–tumour signalling in the lung and brain increases growth of a hard-to-treat cancer
Signalling between neurons and tumour cells in the lung and brain promotes the growth of small-cell lung cancer. These interactions might be a therapeutic target.

Addressing the safety of next-generation batteries
Next-generation batteries will present different risks to conventional lithium-ion cells, emphasizing the need for efforts towards characterizing the abuse tolerance and hazards associated with next-generation battery materials over their life cycle and providing the data in the context of supporting affected professionals.

Gone with the wind: deciphering how dandelions drive seed dispersal
Analysis of seed attachment and the forces needed for detachment reveal how dandelion plants have evolved to spread in the same direction that the wind blows.

Mysterious mass deaths of an extinct giant deer
Fossil find reveals the demise of a group of enormous elks, and local birdsong dialects come under scrutiny in this week’s pick from the Nature archive.

Iron-respiring microbes could have a role in sulfur cycling
A bacterium that uses sulfide as an energy source to metabolize solid iron oxides has been discovered, revealing a biological reaction that was previously assumed to be solely chemical. This finding uncovers a firm microbial link between sulfur and iron cycling in oxygen-free environments such as aquatic sediments.

How did the oldest star clusters form?
A computational model of the early-to-present-day Universe predicts that some of the first stars formed in structures that challenge conventional classification.

Designing an alloy microstructure atom by atom to withstand extreme cold
Atoms are the fundamental building blocks of metallic materials, and their arrangement and distribution determine the material’s properties. Rearranging atoms from a random, disordered state into a carefully ordered dual-scale pattern enhances the mechanical performance of alloys under extremely cold conditions.

Epigenetic clues from cancer’s past foretell its future
An innovative method to trace tumour evolution using patterns of fluctuating DNA modifications could be implemented in the clinic to predict cancer progression.

Heatwaves linked to emissions of individual fossil-fuel and cement producers
The emissions of leading fossil-fuel and cement producers have been systematically linked to particular heatwaves. Three scientists discuss the methodology behind the result and its potential impact on climate-liability court cases.

A common gut fungus worsens infection with the food-borne bacterium Salmonella
In an intricate interaction spanning domains of life, the bacterium Salmonella hijacks the yeast Candida to make it produce and release the amino acid arginine in the gut. Arginine increases the virulence of Salmonella and downregulates the host’s immune response to Salmonella infection, leading to more-severe disease.
