Engineered enzymes can suppress genome-editing errors
Genome editors are molecular machines that can rewrite the genetic code in cells, but sometimes they produce errors in the form of unintended sequence insertions or deletions, collectively known as indel errors. Genome editors have now been engineered that make up to 60-fold fewer indel errors than previous ones did.

Robotic system takes chemistry into hyperspace
Exploring multidimensional ‘landscapes’ of chemical reactions provides rich insights into how they work, and might even enable the discovery of new forms of reactivity.

Climate change is reshaping fish communities in the United States
Rising temperatures and the introduction of non-native fishes have been linked to rapid changes in fish communities across the United States.

Boosting immune cells to combat cancer using CRISPR engineering and large-scale in vivo testing
Immune cells can target cancer in the clinic. The ability to test a gene-editing technology in mice on a large scale should improve such immunotherapies.

Arousal reframed as an organism‑wide dynamic system
The temporal evolution of a hidden, low-dimensional and organism-wide process, inferred from measuring the pupil of an eye, has been shown to account for complex spatio-temporal patterns of brain activity over timescales of seconds. This points to an underlying dynamic that continuously structures the unfolding of brain, body and behavioural variables.

Using short synthetic nucleic acids to probe genes in viruses that infect bacteria
Earth’s most diverse biological entities are the viruses that infect bacteria, called bacteriophages (phages). They are rich resources for discovering proteins and tools for biotechnology, but many phage–bacteria systems resist genetic manipulation. Silencing phage genes in a non-genetic way with short synthetic nucleic acids offers a solution.

A drug–diet combination could improve childhood cancer treatment
Mouse studies show that depriving neuroblastoma of certain amino acids causes a switch in protein synthesis to suppress tumour growth and promote cell differentiation.

How a tick-borne virus enters human cells
Tick-borne encephalitis virus can infect the nervous system and cause life-threatening illness. Finding the cellular gateway it uses could transform prevention and treatment.

Electrostatic-based transfer keeps 2D materials ultra-clean
A technique that spontaneously detaches a 2D material from the substrate on which it was grown creates high-quality nanoscale electronic devices.

A common chromosome fusion in humans explained
A condition known as Robertsonian translocation occurs when the long arms of two chromosomes join together. The characterization of the fully sequenced and assembled fused chromosomes reveals a common fusion site and how these chromosomes are stably transmitted from cell to cell and passed on from parent to child.

Jazzy jaw joints: evolutionary fine-tuning reveals unexpected bone connections in ancient predecessors of mammals
The evolution of the jaw helped mammals to thrive. Fossil discoveries shed light on the diverse evolutionary journeys taken by joints between the skull and lower jaw.

The geoeconomic turn in decarbonization
The rise of green industrial policy is transforming decarbonization efforts; the implications for policymaking and global spillovers are discussed, as well as research needs.

The Biodiversity Cell Atlas: mapping the tree of life at cellular resolution
The Biodiversity Cell Atlas aims to create comprehensive single-cell molecular atlases across the eukaryotic tree of life, which will be phylogenetically informed, rely on high-quality genomes and use shared standards to facilitate comparisons across species.

Fossil fight: how Raymond Dart countered some unfair criticism
A letter to the editor sets the record straight regarding the discovery of Australopithecus, and a proposal to put food on the school curriculum in this week’s pick from the Nature archive

Caribbean coral reefs are threatened by rising seas
Modelling suggests that most Caribbean coral reefs will erode by the year 2100 as sea-level rise outpaces reef growth and limits potential reef restoration.

A surprising way to make heat in an unexpected part of fat cells
Organelles called peroxisomes have been found to have a role in heat generation in fat tissue, and use a mechanism independent of the known heat-producing protein UCP1. The process involves the synthesis and degradation of monomethyl branched-chain fatty acids, driven by the lipid-synthesizing enzyme FASN and the peroxisomal enzyme ACOX2.

A photonic chip enables ultrabroadband wireless communication
Future wireless networks should exploit the full range of telecommunications frequencies. A photonic chip that can reconfigure a broad range of frequencies enables dynamic, full-spectrum management of next-generation communications systems.

People are more likely to cheat when they delegate tasks to AI
Artificial intelligence is moving from being a mere tool to an active partner in decision-making, but when we offload misconduct to machines, who bears the blame?

AI can learn to show its workings through trial and error
Large language models (LLMs) are more accurate when they output intermediate steps. A strategy called reinforcement can teach them to do this without being told.

Bespoke 3D printing adapted to features mapped using computer vision
Conventional 3D printers do not extract information from their environment. A ‘context-aware’ volumetric printer uses light-sheet imaging and visual processing to map objects or living cells embedded in printable materials. This enables rapid, automated fabrication of designs adapted to mapped elements, such as vasculature precisely reaching the bioprinted cells.
