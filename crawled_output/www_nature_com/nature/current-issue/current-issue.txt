The future of universities
Universities have been the cornerstone of higher education for centuries, but since the end of the Second World War, their role has changed significantly. More recently, technological innovations such as artificial intelligence have increased pressure on these institutions like never before, posing fundamental questions about what education is for, how it should be delivered and how it should be funded. This week, in a special issue, Nature probes the challenges faced by higher education — drawing on examples from across the world to assess how the sector can adapt to survive.
