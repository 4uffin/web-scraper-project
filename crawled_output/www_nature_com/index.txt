Daily briefing: No strong evidence backs up Trump’s claims about Tylenol and autism
US President Donald Trump’s claim that Tylenol (paracetamol) is linked to autism “is absolutely not grounded in the scientific findings”, say scientists. Plus, ‘Earth wind’ could be rusting the Moon.

Latest Reviews & Analysis
Engineered enzymes can suppress genome-editing errors
Genome editors are molecular machines that can rewrite the genetic code in cells, but sometimes they produce errors in the form of unintended sequence insertions or deletions, collectively known as indel errors. Genome editors have now been engineered that make up to 60-fold fewer indel errors than previous ones did.

Boosting immune cells to combat cancer using CRISPR engineering and large-scale in vivo testing
Immune cells can target cancer in the clinic. The ability to test a gene-editing technology in mice on a large scale should improve such immunotherapies.

Arousal reframed as an organism‑wide dynamic system
The temporal evolution of a hidden, low-dimensional and organism-wide process, inferred from measuring the pupil of an eye, has been shown to account for complex spatio-temporal patterns of brain activity over timescales of seconds. This points to an underlying dynamic that continuously structures the unfolding of brain, body and behavioural variables.
