A surprising way to make heat in an unexpected part of fat cells
Organelles called peroxisomes have been found to have a role in heat generation in fat tissue, and use a mechanism independent of the known heat-producing protein UCP1. The process involves the synthesis and degradation of monomethyl branched-chain fatty acids, driven by the lipid-synthesizing enzyme FASN and the peroxisomal enzyme ACOX2.

AI can learn to show its workings through trial and error
Large language models (LLMs) are more accurate when they output intermediate steps. A strategy called reinforcement can teach them to do this without being told.
