Iron-respiring microbes could have a role in sulfur cycling
A bacterium that uses sulfide as an energy source to metabolize solid iron oxides has been discovered, revealing a biological reaction that was previously assumed to be solely chemical. This finding uncovers a firm microbial link between sulfur and iron cycling in oxygen-free environments such as aquatic sediments.
