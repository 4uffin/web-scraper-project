Flexible, stretchable medical devices called soft bioelectronic implants have the potential to improve both the quality of life and the survival of people with severe, chronic diseases1,2. Now, Xie et al.3 and Khatib et al.4 report the fabrication of soft bioelectronic fibres made by rolling up stretchy sheets that are patterned with 2D electronics. The fabrication techniques developed by the researchers enable the integration of many electronic components into a single device. As well as sensing the properties of the surrounding tissue, the fibres can stimulate cells (Khatib et al.) or navigate in vivo environments (Xie et al.).
