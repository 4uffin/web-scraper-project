Sustained blows to the head over many years are increasingly being recognized as a serious health risk that affects contact-sport athletes1, military veterans and people who have experienced long-term domestic violence. Writing in Nature, Butler et al.2 investigate the little-understood consequences of repetitive head impacts (RHIs) on the cellular networks that underlie normal brain function.
