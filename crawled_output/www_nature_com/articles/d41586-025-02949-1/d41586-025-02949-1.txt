“You don’t need a weatherman / To know which way the wind blows,” Bob Dylan tells us in his song Subterranean Homesick Blues. One workaround that does not require a meteorologically trained professional is to observe in which direction seeds waft away on the breeze (pictured) from dandelions (Taraxacum officinale). Shields and colleagues delve into the mechanisms that enable this type of plant spread (J. Shields et al. J. R. Soc. Interface 22, 20250227; 2025).
