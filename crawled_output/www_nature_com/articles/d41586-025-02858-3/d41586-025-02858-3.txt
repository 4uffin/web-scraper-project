RESEARCH BRIEFINGS
10 September 2025
A common gut fungus worsens infection with the food-borne bacterium Salmonella
In an intricate interaction spanning domains of life, the bacterium Salmonella hijacks the yeast Candida to make it produce and release the amino acid arginine in the gut. Arginine increases the virulence of Salmonella and downregulates the host’s immune response to Salmonella infection, leading to more-severe disease.
