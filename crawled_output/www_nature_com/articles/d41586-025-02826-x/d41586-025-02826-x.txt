Rivers are some of the most biodiverse ecosystems on Earth. Yet they are intensely exploited, regulated for water supply and flood defence, and affected by a range of factors, including climate change and the introduction of invasive species1. This has resulted in sobering statistics about the perilous state of freshwater biodiversity2. But these data are also interspersed with some positive news, such as an increase in biodiversity associated with improvements in water quality in many European rivers since the late twentieth century3.
