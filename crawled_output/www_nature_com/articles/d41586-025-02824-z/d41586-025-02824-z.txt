A drug–diet combination could improve childhood cancer treatment
Mouse studies show that depriving neuroblastoma of certain amino acids causes a switch in protein synthesis to suppress tumour growth and promote cell differentiation.

Neuroblastoma is a devastating cancer that is responsible for about 15% of cancer-related deaths in children1. It arises from the uncontrolled proliferation of the cells that give rise to tissues of the developing sympathetic nervous system — the branch of the nervous system that controls ‘fight or flight’ responses. Current therapies include a combination of surgery, intensive chemotherapy with stem-cell transplants, radiation and immunotherapy. Despite these multiple interventions, survival rates for high-risk neuroblastoma are low, and children who do survive can experience long-term side effects of the treatment. Therefore, international efforts are ongoing to identify treatment options that are less toxic, more precise and more potent2,3. In 2023, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a drug called difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) for the treatment of high-risk neuroblastoma. Writing in Nature, Cherkaoui et al.4 report a dietary intervention, tested in mice, that has the potential to support DFMO treatment.
