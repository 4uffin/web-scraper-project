AbstractThe Lepidosauria is the most species-rich group of land-dwelling vertebrates. The group includes around 12,000 species of lizards and snakes (Squamata) and one species of Rhynchocephalia, the tuatara Sphenodon punctatus from New Zealand1. Squamates owe their success to their generally small size, but also to their highly mobile skull that enables them to manipulate large prey. These key features of lizard and snake skulls are not seen in Sphenodon, which makes it important to understand the nature of their common ancestor. Lepidosaurs originated in the Triassic 252–201 million years ago, but confusion has arisen because of incomplete fossils, many of which are generalized lepidosauromorphs, neither squamates nor rhynchocephalians2,3,4,5. Here we report a reasonably complete skull and skeleton of a definitive rhynchocephalian from the Middle Triassic (Anisian) Helsby Sandstone Formation of Devon, UK that is around 3–7 million years older than the oldest currently known lepidosaur. The new species shows, as predicted, a non-mobile skull but an open lower temporal bar and no large palatine teeth, and it seems to have been a specialized feeder on insects. This specimen helps us understand the initial diversification of Lepidosauria as part of the Triassic Revolution, when modern-style terrestrial ecosystems emerged.

MainModern squamates owe their success to extraordinary adaptations in their skulls, which include extensive kinesis (Fig. 1) and the ability to flex the snout up and down (mesokinesis). Their skulls can also move the braincase relative to the cranium (metakinesis) and move the quadrate and jaw articulation (streptostyly). These combined joint movements enable lizards, especially snakes, to manipulate and swallow large prey. Sphenodon and fossil rhynchocephalians have largely akinetic skulls that are incapable of any movement except a small degree of metakinesis, which enables powerful bites but limited food manipulation. Modern Sphenodon and squamates differ in the presence and absence, respectively, of the lower temporal bar. In squamates, the open temporal bar is a gap between the jugal and the quadrate bones of the skull that is essential for cranial kinesis. Both Sphenodon and many squamates have extensive palatal dentition, including substantial teeth on the palatine bone. These palatal teeth function in various ways. The lateral tooth row on the palatine in Sphenodon occludes with the lower jaw teeth in shearing food, and the more centrally located palatal teeth, where present in squamates, work the food against horny growths on the tongue or grip prey in the case of snakes.Fig. 1: Evolution of lepidosaurs among amniotes.Time-scaled phylogeny illustrating the variation in morphology of the lower temporal bar and modes of cranial kinesis among fossil and extant diapsids. Skulls are not to scale. Ca, Carboniferous; Ng, Neogene.Full size imageThese differences between the two living clades of lepidosaurs make it hard to reconstruct the probable cranial anatomy and feeding adaptations of the ancestral lepidosaur. Indeed, it is unclear whether these early forms have a kinetic or akinetic skull and what the state of the lower temporal bar and the palatal teeth are. Knowing the ancestors of successful clades is key to dating the timing of origins and the key innovations responsible for their success.In a review of the modern lepidosaur skull6, predictions were made about the nature of the ancestral lepidosaur on the basis of phylogenetic retrodictions from living forms (Fig. 1) and fossils such as Gephyrosaurus bridensis7. It was suggested that the skull would have shown some metakinesis but was otherwise akinetic, and probably had an open lower temporal bar and abundant palatal teeth. In this case, rhynchocephalians retained akinesis and closed the lower temporal bar by extending and suturing the posterior process of the jugal to the quadratojugal and squamosal, as seen in modern Sphenodon8. By contrast, squamates retained the open lower temporal bar and evolved varying degrees of cranial kinesis through bone loss, bone fusion and the formation of new joints. Fossil squamates then might show varying steps along the way to full kinesis, as in many modern lizards and in snakes. All the early forms should show palatal teeth, an inheritance from earlier reptiles.The fossil record of lepidosaurs is patchy, particularly in its older parts, for which species and specimens are rare5,9,10. Because of their generally small size and delicate bones, fossil lepidosaur skeletons can also be incomplete and may lack key, diagnostic characteristics. Lepidosauromorpha (or pan-Lepidosauria), the wider clade, originated in the Permian, and Lepidosauria substantially diversified in the Triassic after the end-Permian mass extinction11. The current oldest member of Rhynchocephalia is Wirtembergia from the late Middle Triassic (239–237 million years ago (Ma)), which seems to show an open lower temporal bar; however, the remains are incomplete12. The oldest known member of crown Squamata is Cryptovaranoides from the Late Triassic (202 Ma), a squamate with anguimorph affinities that has an open lower temporal bar and limited cranial kinesis13,14.Here we present a new specimen, the oldest known member of Lepidosauria, that sheds light on the early history of Lepidosauria and of Rhynchocephalia in particular. The specimen confirms that the open lower temporal is the original condition in Lepidosauria. Moreover, mesokinesis and streptostyly were absent and, unexpectedly, palatal teeth were also absent.Systematic palaeontologyLepidosauria Haeckel, 1866Rhynchocephalia Günther, 1867Sphenodontia Williston, 1925Agriodontosaurus gen. nov.Type and only known species. Agriodontosaurus helsbypetrae gen. et sp. nov.Etymology. Agrio from the ancient Greek epithet of Dionysus, Agrionius, meaning ‘fierce’ and donto for ‘tooth’, which refers to the remarkably large teeth on parts of the dentary and maxilla, and saurus for ‘lizard’. Therefore, ‘fierce-toothed lizard’. The specific term ‘helsbypetrae’ refers to the Helsby Sandstone Formation (locally called the Otter Sandstone), the deposit in which the fossil was found; petrae is the genitive of petra, the latinized form of the ancient Greek word for rock.Holotype. BRSUG 29950-14 (Fig. 2 and Extended Data Fig. 1), a partial skeleton comprising cranial and postcranial elements. The skull is distorted and lacks the rostrum; the left side is more complete than the right side of the skull. Parts of the palate and braincase are damaged. The skull is estimated to have been about 14 mm in length. Also preserved are postcranial elements, including an articulated sequence of cervical and dorsal vertebrae, articulated pectoral and disarticulated pelvic girdles, several dorsosacral and caudal vertebrae and the proximal limb bones.Fig. 2: Holotype specimen of A. helsbypetrae holotype BRSUG 29950-14.a,b, Three-dimensional reconstruction of the skeleton (voxel resolution of 26 μm; Methods) in dorsal (a) and ventral (b) views. c, Lateral reconstruction of A. helsbypetrae based on elements preserved in the holotype.

The specimen is from the Helsby Sandstone Formation of Sidmouth, Devon, UK. It was excavated as a block by R.A.C. in 2015 from a temporarily exposed foreshore exposure beneath Peak Hill (UK National Grid Reference SY 109865), from the upper half of the formation, perhaps upper Anisian (244–241.5 Ma)15.Diagnosis. Small rhynchocephalian with a body length of about 100 mm with a unique combination of the following 13 features: dentary and maxillary anterior teeth are simple and conical but robust; posterior teeth are more triangular with broad bases and set slightly en echelon; anterior maxillary and dentary teeth are acrodont and posterior teeth are pleuracrodont with a residual subdental shelf; maxilla with a pronounced anterior process and high facial process; lateral tooth row on the palatine absent; broad, flat parietal table composed of paired bones; ventral region of orbit bounded mainly by the jugal, which provides about 90% of the boundary and the maxilla the rest; jugal with a prominent, but short, posteroventral process that does not reach halfway in the ventral region of the lower temporal opening; quadrate with conch and large foramen; dentary extends posteriorly to underlie the glenoid of the lower jaw; fused prearticular, articular and surangular in the lower jaw; bicapitate ribs in the cervical and trunk regions; gastralia present; and bulb-shaped expansion of the posteriormost part of interclavicle.Morphological descriptionCraniumThe anteriormost skull bones, the premaxillae, nasals and putative septomaxillae, are not preserved. The maxillae (Fig. 3c–e and Extended Data Fig. 2a–d) resemble the morphology in the basal rhynchocephalians Diphydontosaurus, Planocephalosaurus and Gephyrosaurus16, as well as in the extant Sphenodon. Specifically, the maxillae possess pronounced facial and anterior processes that form the margins of the external nares. The medial surface of the maxillae bears supradental shelves that support the maxillary teeth (Extended Data Fig. 2d,k). When viewed laterally, a facet for articulation of the jugal (Extended Data Fig. 2a) can be seen where it limits, but does not exclude, a maxillary contribution to the ventral margin of the orbit (Fig. 3d).Fig. 3: Skull of holotype specimen A. helsbypetrae holotype BRSUG 29950-14.a–d, Three-dimensional reconstruction of the skull of A. helsbypetrae holotype (voxel resolution of 6 μm; Methods) in dorsal (a), ventral (b), and right (c) and left (d) lateral views. e–i, Reconstructed skull and mandible of A. helsbypetrae in lateral (e,f), medial (g), dorsal (h) and ventral (i) views. Bones in grey and contacts marked with dashed lines are unknown and speculatively reconstructed. Scale bar, 5 mm. Full details of tooth-bearing bones, right quadrate and palate are provided in Extended Data Fig. 3. Colours indicate paired elements between the segmentations and the illustrated reconstructions.Full size imageBoth prefrontals are preserved, but the left and right elements lack their dorsal and ventral portions, respectively (Fig. 3a–e,h). Although the ventralmost extent of the left prefrontal is not preserved, we surmise that it would have contacted the palatine to brace the skull roof, a diagnostic characteristic of lepidosaurs17. The facet is highly probably marked dorsally by a raised area on the anterior side of each palatine, medial to the maxillary facet. Lacrimals and associated facets on the maxilla are absent, which is the case in many rhynchocephalians, particularly sphenodontians16,18,19.The frontals are paired, delineated by a midline suture (Fig. 3a), and together they form an hourglass shape in dorsal view. When viewed ventrally, there is a pronounced thickening of the lateral margins of the frontals that forms the olfactory process along the entire dorsal margin of the orbit. The parietals are paired, and despite abrasion, there is a notable thinning towards the midline that would not be expected if the parietals were fused. There is evidence of a pineal foramen (Fig. 3a,h). The left parietal bears a posterior process, curving to contact the squamosal and form the margin of the supratemporal fenestra (Fig. 3a,h).The postfrontals form a lunate contact at the frontoparietal suture, a feature common in stem lepidosaurs17, and contribute substantially to the margins of the supratemporal fenestra. The postorbitals (Fig. 3a,c–h) are the typical triradiate form of lepidosaurs16 and contribute to much of the ventral margin of the supratemporal fenestra (Fig. 3d).Only the left jugal (Fig. 3d,e) is preserved, with an anterior process that overlaps the maxilla and forms approximately 90% of the ventral margin of the orbit. There is no contact with the squamosal as in Sphenodon (Fig. 3d,e), but unlike basal rhynchocephalians such as Planocephalosaurus20 and clevosaurs21,22. There is a distinct and spur-like posteroventral process, which indicates an incomplete lower temporal arcade (Fig. 3d,e) that is more reduced than in stem-lepidosaurs and in rhynchocephalians such as Gephyrosaurus, Diphydontosaurus, Planocephalosaurus, Clevosaurus and Palaeopleurosaurus16,23. However, it is more pronounced than in the pan-lepidosaurs Marmoretta and Paliguana11.The left squamosal is poorly preserved (Fig. 3a,d,e,h), but the outline confirms the typical tetraradiate shape of early diapsids and rhynchocephalians5. There is no contact with the jugal, but the fragmentary right squamosal is attached to the cephalic head of the right quadrate, holding the bone firmly, thereby confirming that the quadrate was akinetic.Both quadrates are present, although the right is significantly more complete (Fig. 3a,b,e and Extended Data Fig. 3a–d). The ventral end of the quadrate shows a distinct notch-like termination and the condyles for articulation with the articular (Fig. 3a,b,e and Extended Data Fig. 3a). The anterior and posterior margins of the quadrate are thickened, surrounding a central fossa with a prominent quadratojugal foramen and a weakly developed lateral conch (Fig. 3a,e and Extended Data Fig. 3a) that is less developed than in basal rhynchocephalians6,8,22,24 and the lepidosauromorph Sophineta2. The anterior margin bears two probable facets to receive the ventral process of the squamosal (Extended Data Fig. 3a), which means that the squamosal may have extended as far ventrally as the putative quadratojugal, although damage to the area prevents confirmation of this possibility. From computed tomography (CT) slices (Supplementary Data 1 and 2), we identified that a broad flange connected the quadrate and pterygoid medially, which is a typical feature of rhynchocephalians6.The quadratojugals are indistinguishable from the quadrates. The right quadratojugal may be represented by a bulbous expansion of the anteroventral margin of the right quadrate, immediately dorsal of the anterior condyle (Fig. 3a,e and Extended Data Fig. 3a,b) and bordering the tympanic crest.Palate and braincaseMost sutures between elements of the palate are obscure and cannot be discerned in the specimen or in the CT scans, partially because of skull deformation. Only part of the right vomer is preserved (Fig. 3i and Extended Data Fig. 3e,f) and is flat in cross-section, demarcated from the anterior of the right palatine by a ridge on the CT model.The palatines (Fig. 3i and Extended Data Fig. 3e,f) bear maxillary processes that form the anterior margin of a distinct suborbital fenestra, delineated posteriorly by the anterior edge of the ectopterygoid (Fig. 3i and Extended Data Fig. 3e,f). Both palatines also lack any evidence of enlarged teeth (Extended Data Fig. 3e,f), and CT slices (Supplementary Data 1 and 2) show that they are absent, but there are some features that might be the bases of smaller denticles. We devoted much time to searching for palatal teeth on the scans and found no evidence of them. Their absence is further supported by the lack of tooth-wear facets on the lingual side of the dentary (Extended Data Fig. 2g,h), an indicator of the occlusion of the margins of palatine teeth as seen in many rhynchocephalians such as the clevosaurs. Large palatine teeth are about half the size of the maxillary teeth and conspicuous in the palates of Clevosaurus24, Planocephalosaurus20 and Diphydontosaurus8. Therefore, their apparent absence in Agriodontosaurus was unexpected.The pterygoids (Fig. 3i and Extended Data Fig. 3e,f) also show no evidence of dentition, which is unique among early lepidosaurs, including rhynchocephalians, and is seen only in the derived Priosphenodon25 and S. punctatus. The knobbed structures are an artefact of segmentation, and no definitive evidence of dentition was visible in the scan. The medial margins of each pterygoid bound large fossae for the basipterygoid processes (left basipterygoid process; Extended Data Fig. 3e). The main body is flat, differing from squamates that bear a distinct concavity bound by the lateral margins5.The ectopterygoid is broad as it extends anterolaterally—to contact the posterior process of the maxilla—and posteriorly as it forms an arcuate flange with the pterygoid transverse process (Fig. 3i and Extended Data Fig. 3e,f), as seen in Clevosaurus hudsoni and Clevosaurus cambrica21. This posterolateral excavation probably accommodated the m. adductor mandibularis.The dorsal surface of the pterygoid near the right basipterygoid process shows a clear outline and contact with the lower part of the epipterygoid (Extended Data Fig. 3e). Its position precludes any contact with the quadrate anterior lamella. Its base is more like the broad shape in Sphenodon than the more columnar form in Clevosaurus26.Very little of the braincase is fossilized. The parabasisphenoid (Fig. 3i and Extended Data Fig. 3e,f) is poorly preserved, but the posterior extent of its palatal ramus is bordered laterally by both basipterygoid processes. These are short and thick, and the ventral region where it articulates with the pterygoid pocket is visible only in the left basipterygoid (Extended Data Fig. 3f) where it strongly resembles that in Sphenodon27. The main body of the parabasisphenoid bears a single ventral concavity (Extended Data Fig. 3f) like that in other rhynchocephalians such as Diphydontosaurus8 and Sphenodon.Lower jawThe mandible (Fig. 3f,g and Extended Data Fig. 2e–j) is robust and each hemimandible possesses fewer teeth (around 10) than early pan-lepidosaurians (for example, 25–30 in Sophineta2). The dentaries make up most of the lower jaw length (about 85%) and are complete with the full sequence of teeth on the right dentary and a partial sequence on the left. As in sphenodontians, the upper mid-lateral region of the dentary has a secondary thickening of bone (Fig. 3f and Extended Data Fig. 2e) that runs longitudinally. However, no tooth-wear facets into the bone can be discerned. The unfused symphyses are almost vertical, with a rough articulating contact (Extended Data Fig. 2h) that is divided medially by the Meckelian canal into a dorsal and ventral facet (Fig. 3g and Extended Data Fig. 2g,h). The Meckelian canal extends along the entire medial face of the dentary, delineated dorsally by thickened bone that bears a pronounced subdental shelf that supports the dentary teeth (Fig. 3g and Extended Data Fig. 2g,h). This feature is common in basal rhynchocephalians such as Deltadectes, Diphydontosaurus and Planocephalosaurus8,28. A single fused posterior process projects as far as the articular condyles (Fig. 3f,g and Extended Data Fig. 2e–h). There is a small edentulous section that lies at the base of the pronounced coronoid process, which is overlapped by the coronoid. The coronoid process, when compared with the dentary thickness below the mid tooth row, is dorsally expanded far beyond the extent seen in Wirtembergia12 and Diphydontosaurus8. However, it is not as high or pointed as in C. hudsoni, C. cambrica21 or Clevosaurus brasiliensis, more resembling Microsphenodon29 and Sphenodon6. The splenials are absent, with no splenial facets on the dentaries to accommodate them. We therefore suggest that they were absent in life, a condition shared with other rhynchocephalians18. Where the dentary meets the posterior bones of the lower jaw, the Meckelian canal expands into a large medial fossa for attachment of the m. adductor mandibularis (Fig. 3g and Extended Data Fig. 2g,h).The sutures between the post-dentary bones, except the coronoid, are difficult to discern but we identified probable contacts from landmarks in the CT surface models (Fig. 3f,g and Extended Data Fig. 2e–h). Like C. brasiliensis, Microsphenodon, Sphenodon and indeed rhynchocephalians in general, the coronoid is more extensive on the medial than the lateral side of the coronoid process (Fig. 3f,g and Extended Data Fig. 2e–h). It is also strongly concave, contributing heavily to the medial fossae to which the m. adductor mandibularis would attach. There is no anterolateral (that is, labial) process, but medial processes are uncertain and are not coded.On the basis of recognizable ridges on the lateral surfaces of the mandible, we surmise that the angulars underlie the posterior process of the dentary, which makes them only visible as small slivers in lateral view, expanding from below the coronoid process as far posteriorly as the articulars (Fig. 3f,g and Extended Data Fig. 2g,h). The left surangular slightly overlaps the posterior surface of the coronoid process and contributes modestly to its dorsal eminence. Posterolaterally, the face of the surangular is thick, forming a pronounced lateral adductor crest and lateral fossa (Fig. 3f and Extended Data Fig. 2e,f). The articulars (Fig. 3f,g and Extended Data Fig. 2e,j) are marked by the glenoid, of which the lateral margin is higher than the medial, forming a posteromedially oriented facet. At the posterior end, there is a distinct retroarticular that tapers posteriorly into a hook-like process.DentitionThere are up to ten teeth on the dentary and ten on the maxilla (Fig. 3e–g and Extended Data Fig. 2a–j). All teeth are pointed, but the anterior teeth are simple cones with large pulp cavities that differ from the posterior. These teeth have distinct broader crowns and are more triangular, with smaller pulp cavities and are labiolingually compressed (Extended Data Fig. 2i–k) and mesiodistally elongated. There are examples of smaller teeth in the anterior series, which may indicate replacement. Posterior teeth are set en echelon with the mesial aspect of a maxillary tooth partially labially overlapping its anteriorly positioned neighbour (Fig. 3a,c,i and Extended Data Fig. 2i,j), and there is a similar partial overlap on the dentary dentition. The maxillary and dentary posterior teeth each have a posterolingual flange but lack mesial flanges (Fig. 3f,g and Extended Data Fig. 2e–h), which are present in clevosaurs such as C. hudsoni21,24. The shape and positioning of the posterior teeth permitted pronounced shear during occlusion, as indicated by tooth-wear facets and the CT slices (Supplementary Data 1 and 2).The teeth are very large in proportion to the tooth-bearing marginal bones, with many as high as, or higher than, the dorsoventral thickness of the bone to which they are attached. The posterior teeth are ankylosed to distinct supradental/subdental shelves, which are seen medially, and the labial apex of each tooth-bearing marginal bone (pleuracrodonty, sensu28) (Fig. 3g and Extended Data Fig. 2c,d,g,h,k–i). Anteriorly, the teeth are ankylosed directly to the apex of the tooth-bearing marginal bones (acrodonty) (Extended Data Fig. 2i,j). The largest teeth of the tooth-bearing bones are the most mesial or penultimate distal teeth. The shape and mode of implantation of the teeth support a rhynchocephalian affinity, being primarily acrodont as in Clevosaurus, Sphenodon and others, even though Wirtembergia and Diphydontosaurus have pleurodont anterior teeth and acrodont posterior teeth. The exaggerated anterior teeth are rare among early representatives of the clade, but this suite of features can be observed in clevosaurids such as Clevosaurus hadroprodon30.The postcranial skeleton is described in the Supplementary Information and Extended Data Figs. 4–6.Phylogenetic analysisParsimony-based phylogenetic analyses5,29 resolve A. helsbypetrae as a sphenodontian rhynchocephalian positioned crownward of Gephyrosaurus and Diphydontosaurus. Bayesian phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 4) clusters A. helsbypetrae with Wirtembergia, C. hadroprodon and Parvosaurus (posterior probability = 0.50), positioned crownward of Gephyrosaurus and Diphydontosaurus but basal to C. hudsoni and Planocephalosaurus. Furthermore, the procolophonids Kapes and Procolophon form a strongly supported clade along with Palacrodon (posterior probability = 1.0) at the base of the phylogeny, whereas Sophineta is resolved as a pan-lepidosaur (Fig. 4 and Extended Data Fig. 7). Assessed against a more diverse dataset of rhynchocephalians29, parsimony analysis produced 272 most parsimonious trees of 713 steps, a 50% majority rule and strict consensus of which resolves Agriodontosaurus crownward of Diphydontosaurus, Planocephalosaurus and Parvosaurus with strong support (node frequency = 1) (Extended Data Figs. 8 and 9).Fig. 4: Phylogenetic analysis of Diapsida and position of A. helsbypetrae.Maximum parsimony tree from a Bayesian-inference analysis of data modified from the data matrix of ref. 5, plotted against geological time using ruta rooting.

Cryptovaranoides is resolved variously as a sister to crown Squamata or in crown Squamata (Fig. 4 and Extended Data Figs. 7–9), but the data matrix used here lacks definitive characteristics that ally this taxon with Toxicofera and Anguimorpha13,14.DiscussionAgriodontosaurus is one of the earliest occurring sphenodontian rhynchocephalians, being 3–7 million years older than the next oldest rhynchocephalian: Wirtembergia from the Erfurt Formation (late Ladinian, 238 Ma). This finding means that the key phylogenetic split in Lepidosauria, between Rhynchocephalia and Pan-Squamata, occurred minimally at 245–241 Ma. This timeline was not unexpected according to some phylogenies that include taxa such as Megachirella (245 Ma)31, Fraxinisaura and Vellbergia (both 238 Ma)4,34 as stem squamates, but we found that these fall outside the clade Lepidosauria. Therefore, currently, Agriodontosaurus is both the oldest known member of Rhynchocephalia and of Lepidosauria. Furthermore, it provides support for a European origin for Lepidosauria23,35.Fixing dates of the oldest fossil members of crown clades is crucial for dating the tree of life36,37,38,39, and clarity is required over which are members of crown clades or total clades (=crown + stem). Fossils outside the crown cannot contribute to estimating origin dates of modern taxa. Agriodontosaurus fixes a minimum age constraint on the origin of Lepidosauria at 245–241 Ma. The maximum age, or lower bound, is harder to fix. Some studies31,40 project origins of major diapsid clades, including Lepidosauria, into the Permian at around 260 Ma, long before the occurrence of the first fossils. It is unclear, however, whether Lepidosauria had much of a Permian history, but they probably expanded substantially after the end-Permian mass extinction 252 Ma as part of the Triassic Revolution23,41.Our conclusion that Agriodontosaurus belongs to crown Lepidosauria is supported by the following apomorphies17: prefrontals (probably) bracing skull roof on the palate; lacrimal bones largely confined to the orbital rim (in this case, they are entirely absent); marginal teeth attached superficially to the lingual surface of posterior parts of the jaw (rather than in shallow sockets, further modified to more apical attachment in some taxa); and teeth lost from the pterygoid transverse process and from sphenoid bones. Agriodontosaurus also possesses two unexpectedly derived features: few or no teeth on the palatal bones and proportionally large teeth on maxillae and dentaries. The incomplete lower temporal bar in early rhynchocephalians was predicted8, and the mix of acrodont and pleuracrodont marginal teeth is found in basal sphenodontians such as Diphydontosaurus avonis. However, the fully acrodont teeth are anterior in Agriodontosaurus rather than posterior as in Diphydontosaurus. The quadrate conch and prominent olfactory process of the frontal are said11 to distinguish Lepidosauria from Pan-Lepidosauria; both are present in Agriodontosaurus, in which the olfactory processes are similar to those of Clevosaurus42. The posteriorly bowed quadrate of Agriodontosaurus is also a pan-lepidosaurian character11.We also identified the following apparent squamate apomorphies in Agriodontosaurus: jugal closely approaches prefrontal and exposed above the orbital margin of maxilla, mostly excluding the latter from the ventral margin of the orbit; and quadratojugal absent as a discrete element17. Conversely, the suborbital process of the jugal that forms most or all of the ventral margin of the orbit has been regarded as a plesiomorphic feature as it is found in Paliguana11.It was previously predicted6 that the common ancestor of lepidosaurs would possess the following features: paired parietals with a large central parietal foramen; parietal table roughly equal in length to postparietal processes; frontal is the longest skull roofing bone; strongly interdigitated W-shaped frontoparietal suture braced by a strong suture with the postfrontal; tall facial process of the maxilla; postorbitals and postfrontals large and separate, with both forming margins of the orbit and upper temporal fenestra; jugal triangular with barely any posterior process; lateral head of ectopterygoid small and does not contact palatine; large quadrate with a lateral conch firmly held by the pterygoid and squamosal; and squamosal attached to the parietal. All these features are found in Agriodontosaurus.However, Agriodontosaurus differs from the previous predictions6 in the following ways: lack of contact between jugal and squamosal (but similar to Paliguana11); a robust, not long and thin, dentary; and the squamosal, although quadriradiate, is more gracile than predicted. Moreover, although the maxilla contacts the orbital margin, it is less extensive than envisaged, with the jugal positioned well above the maxilla and extending a long way anteriorly (more akin to the squamate condition). Furthermore, there is no evidence of a supratemporal, the pterygoids probably did not contact the vomers (we considered that the palatines contacted in the midline) and, most notably, there is little evidence of a palatal dentition.Some of these differences from predicted basal lepidosaurian features2 are because Agriodontosaurus is a rhynchocephalian. Similarly, the lack of a splenial and small angular and particularly the presence of acrodont or pleuracrodont dentition are characteristic of the Rhynchocephalia. Agriodontosaurus has the short, dorsoventrally thick, dentary with a large coronoid process found in most rhynchocephalians. The acrodont dentition does not contradict the hypothesis that the basal lepidosaur had pleurodont teeth, as the sub and supra-dental shelves in Agriodontosaurus demonstrate derivation from pleurodonty. The basipterygoid processes are short and thick like those of Sphenodon and, like that taxon, probably limited metakinesis, which therefore leaves its rhynchocephalian skull largely akinetic43.Agriodontosaurus differs from later Triassic rhynchocephalians such as Gephyrosaurus and Diphydontosaurus in having a less robust posterior portion of the skull and a relatively larger lower temporal fenestra, although the lower temporal area is similar in magnitude to clevosaurs. Agriodontosaurus also has a prominent anterior process of the maxilla. This feature is found in stem lepidosaurs such as Marmoretta and Fraxinisaura33 and the pleurodont rhynchocephalian Gephyrosaurus but not in the acrodont clevosaurs, although a similar feature, somewhat less developed, is found in Sphenodon.The acrodont–pleuracrodont dentition of Agriodontosaurus is intermediate in some ways between that of stem-lepidosaurs and rhynchocephalians (typically pleurodont or subpleurodont) to that of early squamates (pleurodont-only) and derived rhynchocephalians (acrodont).The probable absence of palatal teeth in Agriodontosaurus contrasts with the numerous palatal teeth of clevosaurs29 and the rhynchocephalians Gephyrosaurus, Diphydontosaurus and Planocephalosaurus. The Ladinian rhynchocephalian Wirtembergia has pterygoid teeth in two rows and there are other small palatal teeth. Some stem lepidosaurs such as the mid-Jurassic Marmoretta33 also have numerous palatal teeth, but the palate is poorly known in Early Triassic pan-lepidosaurs such as Paliguana11 and Sophineta2. However, recent finds of Triassic lepidosauromorphs, including the Ladinian Fraxinisaura34 and Late Carnian Taytalura alcoberi32, are reconstructed with far fewer palatine teeth or pterygoid teeth than, for example, the Late Triassic or Early Jurassic Gephyrosaurus or Diphydontosaurus. Palatal teeth re-evolved in Squamata44,45, and we propose that the same occurred in Rhynchocephalia. Perhaps the row of large lateral palatine teeth co-evolved with the development of a more posteriorly extending jugal posteroventral process. Unfortunately, the palatine is unknown or represented only by scraps of bone in Sophineta2, Vellbergia4, Megachirella31, Wirtembergia12 and C. hadroprodon30.The absence of a lower temporal bar in early lepidosaurs and squamates has long been acknowledged as the ancestral condition for Lepidosauria8,16,23 and was reacquired in Priosphenodon25 and Sphenodon8. The distinct posteroventral process of the jugal in Agriodontosaurus, although less developed than in Gephyrosaurus and Diphydontosaurus, could indicate that rhynchocephalians had begun to reacquire the lower temporal bar earlier than had been thought7,12. However, the less developed posteroventral process in Wirtembergia12 suggests that the lower temporal bar might have re-evolved more than once among Rhynchocephalia. Although the posteroventral process of the jugal is distinct, the quadratojugal is barely distinguishable and probably fused to the quadrate, unlike in Gephyrosaurus or Diphydontosaurus, which have well-developed quadratojugals. Reacquisition of the lower temporal bar might initially have occurred with development of the posteroventral process of the jugal and the quadratojugal perhaps enlarging in later taxa such as C. hudsoni22.The anatomy of Agriodontosaurus provides evidence about its ecology and function. The unique dentition and skull suggest that this was an active predator on large insects, a strategy of prey capture not seen in other Triassic stem or crown lepidosaurs. Evidence that this animal could rapidly deliver a substantial bite force are the dorsally expanded coronoid processes of the dentary, the thick lateral crested rims of the parietal table, the adductor fossae with the large open lower temporal fenestrae and the large upper temporal openings. Furthermore, the position of the glenoid ventral to the tooth row and short retroarticular would enable significant gape capability and enable the teeth to occlude simultaneously along the tooth row16. The anterior large conical piercing teeth would also prevent any forward movement of the prey during occlusion, and the quadrate held securely by the squamosal would have facilitated a firm articulation of the condyles with the glenoid of the lower jaw.These adaptations enabled Agriodontosaurus to hold its struggling prey firmly while it pierced the exoskeleton with its conical and pointed tooth crowns. At the same time, it could shear the tissues and divide the prey into manageable chunks through occlusion of the wide, triangular offset posterior dentition16. There are labial wear facets on the mid mandibular teeth, which demonstrates that the lower and upper teeth cut against each other. Overall, the substantial marginal dentition might have reduced the need for palatal teeth in prey prehension and perhaps suggest a reason for their absence in Agriodontosaurus. We also speculate that, like Sphenodon, Agriodontosaurus was a lingual feeder that used its tongue to manipulate prey in the mouth, placing it between the large marginal teeth.We suggest that Agriodontosaurus had keen senses of sight and hearing on the basis of the relatively large orbits and the presence of the lateral conch on the quadrate, necessary for hunting fast-moving prey8,16. Arthropods available in the Middle Triassic, all of which might have formed parts of the diet of Agriodontodaurus, included polyneopteran insects such as dictyopterans (cockroaches and relatives) and orthopterans (grasshoppers and crickets)46.The tooth shear in Agriodontosaurus, despite representing a hard bite with maxillary and dentary teeth cutting against each other, lacks the precise slicing found in the later Triassic Diphydontosarus8 and particularly in clevosaurs. There are wear facets below the mid and posterior teeth on the lateral side of the dentary in Wirtembergia12 caused by upper teeth cutting against the dentary. In the clevosaurs, the teeth are self-sharpening16,21 as they cut deeply against each other in occlusion. The deep wear facets formed in the lateral side of the dentary in C. hudsoni by this precise shear21 are not observed in the CT scans of Agriodontosaurus. The clevosaur postorbital bar is more robust and the overall postorbital region of clevosaurs, with the well-developed posteriorly elongated jugal process, comprises a greater proportion of the skull16 than in Agriodontosaurus. Therefore, evolution towards a stronger skull structure, including a more complete lower temporal bar, to withstand the forces developed during occlusion separates these Middle and Late Triassic taxa.The suite of features observed in Agriodontosaurus and our identification of it as a crown lepidosaur confirms that the Triassic Revolution was a time of rapid diversification of early Lepidosauria, pushing the origins of several features of derived rhynchocephalians and squamates back to at least the upper Anisian (245–241 Ma). For example, although the skull is essentially akinetic, except for a possible small amount of metakinesis, it shares some features of squamates such as the jugal forming most of the ventral margin of the orbit and the absence of the lower temporal bar. The absence of the lower temporal bar does not equal kinesis, but it is a prerequisite for later evolution of streptostyly and mesokinesis.MethodsLocality and geological settingThe Otter Sandstone, formerly the Otter Sandstone Formation, is an informal term to refer to the Middle Triassic red sandstones of Devon, southern UK, assigned now to the Helsby Sandstone Formation (Sherwood Sandstone Group)47. Magnetostratigraphical data48 indicate that the Otter Sandstone is Middle Triassic (Anisian) in age and that the top of the sequence is close to the Anisian–Ladinian boundary, 242 Ma. The formation comprises up to 200 m of mostly fining-upwards, reddish-hued sandstones separated by thinner layers of conglomerates and mudstones, deposited by a migrating river system under a semi-arid paleoclimate. Fossils include plants, freshwater bivalves, fishes, temnospondyls, procolophonids, rhynchosaurs and archosaurs, all occurring in the upper half of the formation, so probably dating to the upper half of Anisian time15,49. Vertebrate remains from the Otter Sandstone are preserved both as abraded bones and bone pebbles in channel lags and occasionally as more complete material, usually in overbank deposits.A recently discovered thin (about 20–40 mm) sandstone bed located near the top of the Otter Sandstone (Pennington Point Member50) on the coast west of Sidmouth, east Devon, has produced an abundance of vertebrate fossils49. Among these often remarkably well-preserved remains is the nearly complete skull and skeleton of a rhynchocephalian, described here, which was excavated as a block by R.A.C. in 2015 from a temporarily exposed foreshore exposure beneath Peak Hill (National Grid Reference SY 109865). This bone bed was also the source of nearly complete skeletons of fishes, as well as articulated remains of the procolophonid Kapes bentoni51 and the small neodiapsid Feralisaurus corami52. The quality of preservation and articulation of these fishes and small reptiles suggests that they had not been transported far, and there is evidence that they were living on the ponded surface of an exposed channel bar when an adjacent river channel overtopped its banks, probably after a severe rainstorm49. This event rapidly tumbled and then entombed the smaller inhabitants in sediment.SpecimenThe specimen, BRSUG 29950-14, is remarkably preserved and partially articulated, with some minor damage to peripheral structures. The skeleton is contained in a block of fine-grained sandstone measuring 105.9 × 123.7 × 43.8 mm. Most of the skeleton is embedded roughly 15 mm below the surface of the block, and the dorsal margins of the skull, several vertebrae, ribs, pelvic elements and hind limb bones are visible on the surface. These were exposed partly by natural weathering before collection and then by exploratory physical preparation of the specimen by R.A.C. The specimen was soaked for several days in fresh water soon after collection to remove impregnated salt.Institutional abbreviationsBRSUG, University of Bristol, School of Earth Sciences, Geology Collections, UK; EXEMS, Royal Albert Memorial Museum and Art Gallery, Exeter, UK; MCZ, Museum of Comparative Zoology, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.Scanning and segmentationThe three-dimensional (3D) skull and skeleton are based on two separate image stacks of differing resolution. First, a CT scan of BRSUG 29950-14 was produced using the Nikon XTH 225ST X-ray tomography scanner belonging to the Palaeobiology Research Group in the School of Earth Sciences, University of Bristol. Scanned in two parts at 224 kV, it produced a dataset containing a total of 2,940 slices at a voxel resolution of 25.59 µm.Reconstruction of the skeleton was performed using Avizo (v.2020.2)53 to generate 3D models. All surface models were generated in Avizo with an unconstrained smoothing factor of 2 and then exported in an ASCII standard triangle language format. These files were then imported into Blender (v.2.93.3)54 for the purpose of taking photographs and model manipulation. Measurements were also taken in Blender, and the unit scaling was changed to 0.00109 to calibrate the model for accurate measurements of the 3D model.Second, BRSUG 29950-14 was scanned using propagation phase-contrast synchrotron X-ray microcomputed tomography at the BM18 beamline of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) in Grenoble, France. The following beamline set up was used: filtered white beam (Mo 3.75 mm); sample-detector distance of 6 m; indirect detector comprising a 2-mm-thick cerium-doped lutetium aluminium garnet scintillator (Lu3Al5O12:Ce); ×0.642 magnification from a photographic lens; and a sCMOS IRIS-15 camera (Teledyne Photometrics). This set up resulted in a total integrated detected energy of 164 keV, a measured pixel size of 6.0 µm and a field of view of 5,056 × 1,744 (height × volume) pixels (that is, 30.34 × 10.46 mm). To compensate for the limited field of view, 17 acquisitions in planar circular modality with 360° rotation were performed, moving the specimen by 5 mm on the vertical axis after each turn, which resulted in a about 50% vertical overlap; the centre of rotation was shifted by 13.2 mm (corresponding to 2,200 pixels on the detector), which resulted in a reconstructed tomogram of 9,456 × 9,456 pixels (that is, 56.74 × 56.74 mm). Each acquisition consisted of 13,000 projections, each resulting from the accumulation of 5 frames with an exposure time of 25 ms (125 ms of total integration time per projection). Moreover, before each acquisition, 50 dark current images (image without beam) and 51 flatfield images (image with beam and no sample) were recorded. The tomographic reconstruction was done using the single distance phase retrieval approach55,56 implemented in Nabu software57. Post-processing on the resulting 32 bits reconstructed stack included change of the dynamic range to 16 bits, discarding values outside the 0.001% minimum and 99.999% maximum percentiles, ring correction58 and cropping of the volume. Moreover, a 2 × 2 × 2 binning copy of the data was generated to facilitate quick inspection. The MatLab code for ring correction, cropping and binning is available from GitHub (https://github.com/HiPCTProject/Tomo_Recon).BRSUG 29950-14 was also scanned using conventional absorption-contrast tomography at the I12-JEEP beamline59 (experiment MG40234-1) of the Diamond Light Source in Oxfordshire, UK. Imaging was performed using an 89 keV monochromatic beam, a sample-to-detector distance of 350 mm to minimize phase-contrast effects, optical module 2 (pixel size of 7.91 μm) with a 300 μm Crytur LuAG:Ce scintillator, a pco.edge 5.5 sCMOS visible light camera and an extended field of view configuration60 (up to 40 × 12 mm for module 2). Each acquisition consisted of 4,801 projections over 360° (angular step of 0.075°) and an exposure time of 0.15 s per projection; a total of 4 acquisitions were taken with vertical offsets of 8 mm (around 33% overlap). Tomographic reconstruction was carried out using Savu software61, with a pipeline involving flat and dark correction, correction for distortion introduced by the optical set-up, ring removal, automatic centre-of-rotation determination, sinogram stitching, Fresnel filtering and GPU reconstruction using the FBP algorithm implemented in Astra Toolbox62. Stitching of reconstructed volumes was performed using an overlap-informed digital image correlation technique implemented as part of an in-house script, with a final data volume of 40.5 × 40.5 × 36.3 mm (480 GB). Where necessary for ease of visualization, downsampling from float32 to uint8 was performed using an in-house script by fitting to a histogram of voxel intensities to a signal and noise model and clipping the resulting pixel intensity range to 5 standard deviations around the fitted data peak.Reconstruction of the specimen’s skull in 3D was carried out in the tomography laboratory housed in the University of Bristol Life Sciences Building using Dragonfly (v.2022.2)63. The size of the original image stack (15,088 slices) necessitated some image resampling for Dragonfly to process. Thus, the data were resampled at a factor of 4 in each axis to reduce the maximum number of slices to 3,771 while still retaining excellent detail of the skull and dentition. This higher resolution scan enabled the scoring of morphological characteristics that were not visible at lower resolution, in particular those of the teeth, vomer, palatine and pterygoid sequence.Phylogenetic analysisAnatomical characteristics of BRSUG 29950-14 were scored against two data matrices for the purposes of this analysis.First, the specimen was coded against a matrix of 383 morphological characteristics and 127 taxa (modified from a previous study5), including a new characteristic to code for the presence of a diapsid skull and 6 other taxa, including the procolophonids K. bentoni51, Procolophon trigoniceps64,65, Palacrodon browni66 and the rhynchocephalians C. hadroprodon30, Wirtembergia hauboldae12 and Parvosaurus harudensis35. This matrix was chosen for its substantial outgroup taxa for early diapsids and archosaurs, the addition of new characteristics and taxa as well as the removal of others, building on previous versions of this same matrix11,31,33. A. helsbypetrae was scored for 203 of these characteristics and added to the matrix. Owing to the well-documented disagreement between morphology-only and molecular analyses39,67,68,69, we adopted a strict topological constraint on groups in crown Squamata, using S. punctatus as the outgroup to follow the generally accepted topology resolved from recent molecular analyses. This constraint forces the position of Gekkonomorpha as basal to Lacertoidea with Iguania as the most derived clade of crown squamates, in line with recent publications5,31. Using this constraint enabled the resolution of the most accurate position of A. helsbypetrae in the larger topology of Lepidosauria as well as streamlining the analysis by bypassing the need for extensive processing time of molecular data.Second, A. helsbypetrae was scored against a dataset comprising Sophineta, two extant squamates and 57 rhynchocephalians to assess its position in a more diverse rhynchocephalian phylogeny29. As in the original publication29, several rogue taxa were excluded from subsequent analysis (Whitakersaurus bermani, Deltadectes elvetica and Kawasphenodon expectatus). Of the 162 morphological characteristics, 116 were successfully coded in Agriodontosaurus and added to the matrix. The matrix was analysed under equal-weights parsimony in TNT (v.1.6)70 using a traditional heuristic search of 5,000 Wagner trees with tree bisection and reconnection as the branch swapping algorithm per a previous study29. The resulting most-parsimonious trees were exported to R (v.3.6.9)71 to generate a 50% majority-rule consensus using the ape-package72. Further parsimony analyses were conducted using PAUP73, with and without a genomic tree constraint.Bayesian inferenceThe modified 127 taxon matrix was subjected to Bayesian inference in MrBayes (v.3.2.7)74 under the fossilized birth–death and relaxed clock transition model (outlined in a previous study5). The age calibration of individual taxa is based on a uniform distribution from their first and last appearance data5,31. Two runs of Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis were run for 30 million generations, sampled every 10,000 generations and a relative burn-in of 0.5. The resulting consensus tree was subject to further analysis in R71, using the timePaleoPhy function of the paleotree package75 to time calibrate it under the minimum branch length model and to produce a conservative estimate of branch divergence times, with a particular focus on the origin of Lepidosauromorpha. Dated time trees were constructed in R using the geoscalePhylo function of the strap package76.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.
