To Have or To Hold Sophie Pavelle Bloomsbury (2025)In the title of her engaging and eloquent book about symbiosis, science communicator Sophie Pavelle evokes traditional Christian marriage vows. But ‘and’ becomes ‘or’ — alluding to the fact that symbiotic relationships in nature can be “darker, far more shocking and much more scandalous than you could imagine”. They are often “parasitic relationships” in which members of one species decline and those of another survive by exploiting their bond. Pavelle describes eight symbiotic sets of organisms from the British Isles.Sex Is a SpectrumAgustín Fuentes Princeton Univ. Press (2025)An Atlantic fish, the bluehead wrasse (Thalassoma bifasciatum), kicks off this fascinating book about sex. Females produce eggs and males make sperm. But if the group’s largest male gets killed, a female takes over by rapidly altering its reproductive organs, thus becoming the main sperm producer. “On the face of it, sex is a paradox,” writes anthropologist Agustín Fuentes. “Wouldn’t life be easier if organisms just kept copying themselves to reproduce?” Among humans, he argues, women and men overlap more than is generally thought.Being VictorianJamie Camplin Unicorn (2025)The Victorian period (1837–1901) ended in colonial oppression. But “in a unique moment in world history, the arts, science and religious belief often came joyously together before falling deeply apart”, writes Jamie Camplin in his finely composed fusion of events, ideas and personalities of an era that still fascinates the world. It saw the coinage of the word scientist by William Whewell, a linguist, historian of science, mathematician, mineralogist, philosopher and theologian who resisted becoming too specialized in any one field.Dinner with King TutSam Kean Little, Brown (2025)
