Robotic system takes chemistry into hyperspace
Exploring multidimensional ‘landscapes’ of chemical reactions provides rich insights into how they work, and might even enable the discovery of new forms of reactivity.

When people think of a reaction to synthesize a new chemical compound, they might imagine an equation consisting of one or two reactants on the left-hand side, leading to a single product compound on the right. Around the reaction arrow, details of the conditions might be given: a single temperature, catalyst concentration or reaction time, for instance.
