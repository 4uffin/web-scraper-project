How a tick-borne virus enters human cells
Tick-borne encephalitis virus can infect the nervous system and cause life-threatening illness. Finding the cellular gateway it uses could transform prevention and treatment.

Flaviviruses infect hundreds of millions of people each year worldwide1. Named after the Latin word flavus (meaning yellow) for the founding member, yellow fever virus, this group of viruses includes medically important pathogens that are transmitted mainly by mosquitoes and ticks. Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), for example, circulates in the forests of Europe and northeastern Asia, spreading through tick bites or, occasionally, raw dairy products from infected farm animals. Many TBEV infections are asymptomatic, but some follow a two-phase illness beginning with flu-like symptoms (peripheral phase) and, in severe cases, progressing to life-threatening inflammation of the brain and spinal cord (neuroinvasive phase)2. Writing in Nature, Mittler et al.3 identify a key cell-surface protein that TBEV uses to enter human cells and initiate infection, filling a major gap in scientists’ understanding of flavivirus entry mechanisms.
