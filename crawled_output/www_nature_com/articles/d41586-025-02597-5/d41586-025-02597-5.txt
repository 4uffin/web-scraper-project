Mystery Martian minerals hint at the planet’s complex geochemical past
The Perseverance rover on Mars has observed unusual minerals associated with organic matter — raising questions about the geochemistry of ancient Mars.

In 2020, NASA dispatched the Perseverance rover to Jezero Crater on Mars to investigate and cache surface material. Writing in Nature, Hurowitz et al.1 report Perseverance’s observations of small nodules of unusual minerals (Fig. 1) in the clay-rich ‘mudstone’ rocks of Neretva Vallis — a valley on the western edge of Jezero Crater, characterized by sedimentary rocks that were deposited by ancient water systems. The findings shed light on the remarkable complexity of the oxidation–reduction (redox) chemistry that took place on ancient Mars, and might provide a fresh perspective on prebiotic chemical processes — reactions that could form a basis for the emergence of life.
