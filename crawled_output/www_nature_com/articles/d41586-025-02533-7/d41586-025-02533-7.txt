Caribbean coral reefs are threatened by rising seas
Modelling suggests that most Caribbean coral reefs will erode by the year 2100 as sea-level rise outpaces reef growth and limits potential reef restoration.

Coral reefs provide habitats rich in biodiversity and offer protection against flooding. Climate change threatens their existence if sea-level rise (SLR) outpaces the ability of coral reefs to grow when molecules of calcium carbonate are added to them though a process termed accretion. Writing in Nature, Perry et al.1 present modelling of reef growth and SLR under a variety of global-warming scenarios for more than 400 coral reefs in the tropical western Atlantic (TWA), including reefs in the Florida Keys, the Gulf of Mexico and Mexican Mesoamerica.
