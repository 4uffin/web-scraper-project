Boosting immune cells to combat cancer using CRISPR engineering and large-scale in vivo testing
Immune cells can target cancer in the clinic. The ability to test a gene-editing technology in mice on a large scale should improve such immunotherapies.

Certain types of cancer can be treated with engineered versions of a person’s own immune cells that target tumour cells. The effectiveness of these T cells, called chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, can be influenced by the genes that they express. Writing in Nature, Datlinger et al.1 and Knudsen et al.2 present an in vivo method that uses the gene-editing technology CRISPR on a large scale to identify genes that, if engineered not to be expressed (termed knocked out), lead to increased persistence and better anticancer functions of CAR T cells. This approach offers advantages compared with previous work that relied on CRISPR editing but predominantly used in vitro analyses of the function of CAR T cells.
