AbstractThe evolution of a single-dentary-boned lower jaw and its secondary craniomandibular articulation between the dentary condyle and the squamosal glenoid has been regarded as a pivotal vertebrate innovation and defining mammalian trait1,2,3,4,5,6,7. Here we report two mammaliamorphs with novel shapes of secondary jaw joint, offering insight into the evolution of the mammalian jaw. The first, Polistodon8, a Middle Jurassic herbivorous tritylodontid with a relatively large body size and a lifestyle that is likely to have been fossorial, uniquely evolved a dentary–jugal articulation. The second, an Early Jurassic morganucodontan, exhibits a dentary–squamosal joint that lacks a bulbous condyle, supporting the hypothesis that the mammalian dentary condyle was formed by expansion of the lateral ridge of the dentary9. These diverse joints reflect repeated evolutionary experimentation in advanced cynodonts, in which secondary jaw joints arose independently7,10, and in which the load-bearing dentary–squamosal joint is a synapomorphy of mammaliaforms. Although body miniaturization might have driven this transformation11, our findings indicate that other factors were involved, such as jaw-muscle reorganization, feeding ecology and masticatory behaviour7,12,13,14,15,16,17. The ecomorphological diversity of these taxa suggest that phenotypic plasticity and environmentally induced morphological changes18,19,20 could have shaped jaw-joint evolution, emphasizing how ecological pressures and developmental flexibility guided the diversification of jaw structures in mammalian ancestors.

See Supplementary Information for additional information. The blue polygon represents the load-bearing dentary–squamosal jaw joint that diagnoses Mammaliaformes (in blue shape), including mammals. Red arrows point to the phylogenetic positions of the two taxa reported in the study. Red dots indicate taxa that are used in Fig. 4 in the main text that possess the secondary jaw joint except for Thrinaxodon that has only the exclusive articular–quadrate joint. See Supplementary Information for the result of the bootstrap analysis.Extended Data Table 1 Measurements of the Polistodon postcanine teeth (occlusal length and width)Full size tableSupplementary informationSupplementary InformationSupplementary Information Part I provides a category summarizing different types of the primary and secondary jaw joints in known mammaliamorphs and their close relatives. In the Systematic Palaeontology, we provide the differentiate diagnoses (the amended diagnosis is in the main text) for Polistodon channanensis He and Cai, 1984 and a redescription of the holotype specimen (ZDM8601). Illustrations of ZDM8601 are in the main text and Extended Data figures. We also provide the differentiate diagnoses for the new morganucodontan genus and species Camurocondylus lufengensis. gen. et sp. nov. (the diagnosis is in the main text) and a detailed description of the holotype specimen (IVPP V8685). Supplementary Information Part I also has the character list that includes specific coding for three relevant genera, Polistodon, Camurocondylus and Diarthrognathus, in addition to other taxa used in a previous study (Mao et al., 2024a). The character list contains brief explanations about the characters and character coding that are modified based on the new data recognized in this study. Supplementary Information Part II includes the data matrix, PAUP phylogenetic analyses and the resulting logs of the analysis about the strict consensus tree. The related character list, dataset, settings and logs of these analyses are presented deposited at MorphoBank (http://www.morphobank.org) and Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10597270) (See also Methods in the main text). Supplementary Information Part III is the online link to the 3D stl files of reconstructed skulls of the holotype of Polistodon channanensis (ZDM8601) and the holotype of Camurocondylus lufengensis. gen. et sp. nov. (IVPP V8685).Reporting SummaryPeer Review FileRights and permissionsSpringer Nature or its licensor (e.g. a society or other partner) holds exclusive rights to this article under a publishing agreement with the author(s) or other rightsholder(s); author self-archiving of the accepted manuscript version of this article is solely governed by the terms of such publishing agreement and applicable law.Reprints and permissionsAbout this articleCite this articleMao, F., Jiang, S., Liu, J. et al.
