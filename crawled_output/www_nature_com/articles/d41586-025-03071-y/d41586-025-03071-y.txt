Engineered enzymes can suppress genome-editing errors
Genome editors are molecular machines that can rewrite the genetic code in cells, but sometimes they produce errors in the form of unintended sequence insertions or deletions, collectively known as indel errors. Genome editors have now been engineered that make up to 60-fold fewer indel errors than previous ones did.
