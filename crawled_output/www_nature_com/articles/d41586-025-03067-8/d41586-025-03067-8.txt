Arousal reframed as an organism‑wide dynamic system
The temporal evolution of a hidden, low-dimensional and organism-wide process, inferred from measuring the pupil of an eye, has been shown to account for complex spatio-temporal patterns of brain activity over timescales of seconds. This points to an underlying dynamic that continuously structures the unfolding of brain, body and behavioural variables.
