AI can learn to show its workings through trial and error
Large language models (LLMs) are more accurate when they output intermediate steps. A strategy called reinforcement can teach them to do this without being told.

When a student encounters a challenging mathematics problem or a programmer needs to write a complex algorithm, they will rarely solve it all in one go. Instead, they will reason through the task, jotting down notes and intermediate steps to arrive at a final solution. Likewise, large language models (LLMs) — artificial intelligence (AI) systems that process and generate human language — perform better at complex tasks when they write down their reasoning process before blurting out an answer than when they do not1. In a paper in Nature, the DeepSeek AI team2 reports that LLMs can be incentivized to learn to reason without ever being shown examples of human reasoning trajectories, using a trial-and-error process called reinforcement learning.
