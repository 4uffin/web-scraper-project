How did the oldest star clusters form?
A computational model of the early-to-present-day Universe predicts that some of the first stars formed in structures that challenge conventional classification.

Some of the oldest structures that have been observed in the Universe are collections of stars called globular clusters1. Globular clusters have been found in most galaxies2. They are characterized by their high masses compared with those of other star clusters and their spherical appearance. The age of the stars in globular clusters indicates that they formed when the first galaxies were still assembling, but astronomers don’t know exactly how this occurred. In a paper in Nature, Taylor et al.3 report supercomputer simulations of the formation of globular clusters and galaxies. The researchers identify in their simulations a new class of stellar structures that they call globular-cluster-like dwarfs, which have properties between those of globular clusters and galaxies. They predict that if such objects exist, they could be a site at which to search for the first generations of stars.
