AbstractOne of the goals of ‘AI for Science’ is to discover customized materials through real-world experiments. Pioneering advances have been achieved in computational predictions and the automation of materials synthesis1–7. Yet, most materials experimentation remains constrained to using unimodal active learning (AL) approaches, relying on a single data stream. The potential of AI to interpret experimental complexity remains largely untapped8,9. Here we present Copilot for Real-world Experimental Scientists (CRESt), a platform that integrates large multimodal models (LMMs, incorporating chemical compositions, text embeddings, and microstructural images) with Knowledge-Assisted Bayesian Optimization (KABO) and robotic automation. CRESt employs knowledge-embedding-based search space reduction and adaptive exploration–exploitation strategy to accelerate materials design, high-throughput synthesis and characterization, and electrochemical performance optimization. CRESt allows monitoring with cameras and vision-language-model-driven hypothesis generation to diagnose and correct experimental anomalies. Applied to electrochemical formate oxidation, CRESt explored over 900 catalyst chemistries and 3500 electrochemical tests within 3 months, identifying a state-of-the-art catalyst in the octonary chemical space (Pd–Pt–Cu–Au–Ir–Ce–Nb–Cr) which exhibits a 9.3-fold improvement in cost-specific performance.
