AbstractNeutral atoms are a promising platform for quantum science, enabling advances in areas ranging from quantum simulations1−3 and computation4−10 to metrology, atomic clocks11−13 and quantum networking14−16. While atom losses typically limit these systems to a pulsed mode, continuous operation17−22 could significantly enhance cycle rates, remove bottlenecks in metrology23, and enable deep-circuit quantum evolution through quantum error correction24,25. Here we demonstrate an experimental architecture for high-rate reloading and continuous operation of a large-scale atom array system while realizing coherent storage and manipulation of quantum information. Our approach utilizes a series of two optical lattice conveyor belts to transport atom reservoirs into the science region, where atoms are repeatedly extracted into optical tweezers without affecting the coherence of qubits stored nearby. Using a reloading rate of 300,000 atoms in tweezers per second, we create over 30,000 initialized qubits per second, which we leverage to assemble and maintain an array of over 3,000 atoms for more than two hours. Furthermore, we demonstrate persistent refilling of the array with atomic qubits in either a spin-polarized or a coherent superposition state while preserving the quantum state of stored qubits. Our results pave the way for realization of large-scale continuously operated atomic clocks, sensors, and fault-tolerant quantum computers.

This video depicts the atom motions employed in our demonstrations of continuous reloading. Every 80ms, a defect-free array of atoms from the preparation zone is transported to the storage zone to assemble an array of 3,000+ atoms in six loading iterations. After assembly, one of six interleaved subarrays is ejected from the storage array and refilled with a fresh set of atoms, which, in principle, can be repeated indefinitely. The storage array sites are spaced by 3μm vertically and alternate between 3μm and 6μm spacing horizontally to allow for lossless atom transport in between columns. Yet, every storage subarray features regular spacings of 9μm in both directions. Atoms from the preparation zone are rearranged with 9μm horizontal and 4.5μm vertical spacing, then further expanded vertically during the atom transport to match the dimensions of the storage subarrays.Rights and permissionsReprints and permissionsAbout this articleCite this articleChiu, NC., Trapp, E.C., Guo, J. et al.
