Designing an alloy microstructure atom by atom to withstand extreme cold
Atoms are the fundamental building blocks of metallic materials, and their arrangement and distribution determine the material’s properties. Rearranging atoms from a random, disordered state into a carefully ordered dual-scale pattern enhances the mechanical performance of alloys under extremely cold conditions.
