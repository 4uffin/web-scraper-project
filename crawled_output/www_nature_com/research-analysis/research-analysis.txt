Engineered enzymes can suppress genome-editing errors
Genome editors are molecular machines that can rewrite the genetic code in cells, but sometimes they produce errors in the form of unintended sequence insertions or deletions, collectively known as indel errors. Genome editors have now been engineered that make up to 60-fold fewer indel errors than previous ones did.

Arousal reframed as an organism‑wide dynamic system
The temporal evolution of a hidden, low-dimensional and organism-wide process, inferred from measuring the pupil of an eye, has been shown to account for complex spatio-temporal patterns of brain activity over timescales of seconds. This points to an underlying dynamic that continuously structures the unfolding of brain, body and behavioural variables.

Using short synthetic nucleic acids to probe genes in viruses that infect bacteria
Earth’s most diverse biological entities are the viruses that infect bacteria, called bacteriophages (phages). They are rich resources for discovering proteins and tools for biotechnology, but many phage–bacteria systems resist genetic manipulation. Silencing phage genes in a non-genetic way with short synthetic nucleic acids offers a solution.

A common chromosome fusion in humans explained
A condition known as Robertsonian translocation occurs when the long arms of two chromosomes join together. The characterization of the fully sequenced and assembled fused chromosomes reveals a common fusion site and how these chromosomes are stably transmitted from cell to cell and passed on from parent to child.
