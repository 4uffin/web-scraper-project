A surprising way to make heat in an unexpected part of fat cells
Organelles called peroxisomes have been found to have a role in heat generation in fat tissue, and use a mechanism independent of the known heat-producing protein UCP1. The process involves the synthesis and degradation of monomethyl branched-chain fatty acids, driven by the lipid-synthesizing enzyme FASN and the peroxisomal enzyme ACOX2.

A photonic chip enables ultrabroadband wireless communication
Future wireless networks should exploit the full range of telecommunications frequencies. A photonic chip that can reconfigure a broad range of frequencies enables dynamic, full-spectrum management of next-generation communications systems.

Bespoke 3D printing adapted to features mapped using computer vision
Conventional 3D printers do not extract information from their environment. A ‘context-aware’ volumetric printer uses light-sheet imaging and visual processing to map objects or living cells embedded in printable materials. This enables rapid, automated fabrication of designs adapted to mapped elements, such as vasculature precisely reaching the bioprinted cells.

Earth’s atmosphere took two billion years to become fully oxygenated
High-resolution isotope data show that a modern-like, oxygen-rich atmosphere was not established until 410 million years ago, supporting a 2-billion-year transitional oxygenation of Earth’s surface. The record also captures a dynamic co-evolution of atmospheric and oceanic reduction–oxidation states, with repeated oxygenation pulses and feedback cycles.
