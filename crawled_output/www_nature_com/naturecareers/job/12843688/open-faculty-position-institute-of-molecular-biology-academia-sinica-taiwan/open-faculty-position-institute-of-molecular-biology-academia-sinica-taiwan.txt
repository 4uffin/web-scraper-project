Job Details
One tenure-track faculty position at all levels (Assistant, Associate, or Full Research Fellow) is open for a qualified individual to establish an active research program at the Institute of Molecular Biology (IMB) at Academia Sinica (http://www.imb.sinica.edu.tw/en). IMB provides a stimulating research environment, with research spanning diverse and interconnected areas of contemporary biology, integrating molecular, structural, developmental, and systems approaches to investigate complex biological questions.
Applicants should hold a Ph.D. degree or its equivalent, along with appropriate postdoctoral research experience. The successful candidate will receive a generous multi-year start-up package, followed by long-term intramural funding. IMB features several core facilities (imaging, genomics, RNAi, electrophysiology, FACS, biophysics, bioinformatics, transgenic core, and animal facility) that provide state-of-the-art resources and key technical expertise to support the Institute’s research. Currently, several Ph.D. programs, including one that recruits international students, are formally affiliated with the Institute. English is the official language for seminars and lectures at the Institute, and proficiency in Chinese is not a prerequisite for application.
Applicants should send electronic files of their Curriculum Vitae and a description of past research accomplishments and future research plans, and should arrange for three letters of recommendation to be sent directly to Director Hwai-Jong Cheng c/o Ms. Vivi Chiang (viviwen@as.edu.tw).
The selection process will begin on Nov. 15, 2025, and will continue until the positions are filled. Further information can be obtained from Ms. Vivi Chiang at viviwen@as.edu.tw
