ShanghaiTech University 上海科技大学
Jointly founded by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and Shanghai Municipal People’s Government in 2013, ShanghaiTech University aspires to be a small-scale, high-level, international university oriented towards research and innovation, for nurturing the next generation of innovative scientists, inventors, and entrepreneurs. On February 14, 2022, ShanghaiTech joined the list of China’s World-Class Universities Project as the youngest university in that list. With the backing and support of our two co-founding institutions, ShanghaiTech is committed to tackling the challenges that China and the world are facing in the fields covering artificial intelligence, biology, biomedical engineering, data science, electrical engineering, energy, environment, human health, materials, and others.
ShanghaiTech’s tenure-track system is attracting talented faculty with a wealth of experience from world-leading universities and institutes. Currently there are ~340 professors under the tenure-track system, 80% of whom have overseas study or work experiences and around 14% are foreign nationals. Our team of nearly 290 adjunct professors includes four Nobel Prize winners, 38 academicians of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and the Chinese Academy of Engineering (CAE).
With a focus on STEM fields, ShanghaiTech has established the following schools, institutes, one center and a research hospital:
-School of Physical Science and Technology
-School of Life Science and Technology
-School of Information Science and Technology
-School of Entrepreneurship and Management
-School of Creativity and Art
-Institute of Humanities
-School of Biomedical Engineering
-Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies
-iHuman Institute
-Institute of Mathematical Sciences

Located in Shanghai’s Zhangjiang Hi-Tech Park, ShanghaiTech plays an important role in the development of the Zhangjiang Comprehensive National Science Center, in partnership with CAS institutes. The proximity of neighboring facilities offers numerous opportunities for scientific collaborations. The world-class scientific facilities include: National Center for Protein Science (Shanghai), Shanghai HIgh repetitioN rate XFEL and Extreme light facility (SHINE), Shanghai Superintense Ultrafast Laser Facility (SULF), Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF), Shanghai Soft X-ray Free Electron Laser Facility (SXEFL), and others. These facilities welcome not only ShanghaiTech staff and students, but also other researchers from China and the world.
Currently, there are over 300 research groups at ShanghaiTech. Since 2016, ShanghaiTech has published 85 Cell, Nature and Science papers as the main affiliation, and multiple achievements are recognized at the national/municipal level, including two awards among Top 10 Scientific Advances in China, one award among Top 10 S&T Advances in Chinese Universities, five awards among Top 10 Advances in Life Sciences in China, and one 1st prize of the Shanghai S&T Awards, etc.
In 2019, ShanghaiTech ranks first in the Report on Tech Transfer Achievements in China (Higher Education Institution)1. Since the birth of the first spinoff company in 2016, ShanghaiTech has incubated 40 spinoffs, spanning the areas of biomedicine, IT&AI, high-end manufacturing and new energy. Not only the faculty, but also the students become founders of those spinouts. Further, dedicated incubators inside and outside the campus serve as vital “powerhouses” of innovation practices and bridges for connecting technical, market, policy and capital resources.
