Job Details
We are seeking a highly motivated Postdoctoral Fellow to join a Marsden-funded research programme investigating the molecular mechanisms by which a new bacteriophage-derived enzyme (an endolysin) interacts with and crosses Gram-negative bacterial membranes. The successful candidate will use biophysical, structural, and computational tools to unravel how endolysins interact with and cross the outer membrane, and will apply this knowledge to engineer new antimicrobial enzymes.
Key Responsibilities
Characterise interactions using NMR spectroscopy, analytical ultracentrifugation, and molecular dynamics simulations
Investigate membrane disruption and pore formation using liposome assays and mutagenesis
Engineer endolysin variants and fusions with enhanced activity or altered specificity
Collaborate with a multidisciplinary team across microbiology, structural biology, and computational modelling
Contribute to publications, IP generation, and mentoring of PhD students
About you
Essential Qualifications:
PhD in Biochemistry, Structural Biology, Molecular Biology, or a related field o
Strong experience in protein expression, purification, and characterisation o Familiarity with membrane protein biophysics, liposome assays, or NMR spectroscopy
Demonstrated ability to publish in peer-reviewed journals
Excellent communication and collaboration skills Desirable Experience: o Experience with molecular dynamics simulations or computational modelling
Knowledge of bacteriophage biology, clinical microbiology or antimicrobial protein design o Interest in translational research and antimicrobial resistance What We Offer
Access to world-class facilities (NMR, crystallography, microbiology, and computational biology) located at UC, PHF Science and University of Auckland.
Mentorship from leading researchers across three organisations: Prof. Renwick Dobson, Dr Craig Billington, Dr Vanessa Morris, A/Prof Jane Allison o Opportunities for international collaboration (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)
A vibrant, interdisciplinary research environment with strong industry and policy engagement
