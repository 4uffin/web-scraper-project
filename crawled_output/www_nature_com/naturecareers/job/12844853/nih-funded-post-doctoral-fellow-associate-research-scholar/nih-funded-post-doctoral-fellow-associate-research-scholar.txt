Job Details
NIH-funded post-doctoral research fellow position in cancer metabolomics
The Pankaj Singh lab at the newly established Department of Oncology Science and the NCI-designated OU Health Campus/Stephenson Cancer Center is recruiting a passionate and dedicated postdoctoral researcher to join an NIH/NCI-funded study on cancer metabolomics. The research project involves investigating metabolic alterations in cancer cells and tumor tissues, tumor-stromal metabolic crosstalk, and immunometabolism, using cutting-edge targeted and untargeted metabolomic technologies and spatial LC-MS/MS-based metabolic imaging. A successful postdoctoral candidate should have a Ph.D. in the relevant field with a strong background in LC-MS/MS. Some bioinformatics expertise is preferred but not required. More details about our work can be found in some of our recent publications (Cancer Cell 2017 32(1):71-87; JEM 2020 217 (7):e20190745; PNAS 109(34):13787-92; Immunity 2019 50(3):576-590; Nature Medicine. 2019 25(4):628-640; Gastroenterology 2021 Jul 8:S0016-5085(21)03159-0; Nature Reviews Cancer 2023 Mar 27:1-20, Nature Cell Biology, 2024 May;26(5):840).
Our program is well-funded by NCI, with multiple R01 grants and a U54 grant on acquired therapy resistance in pancreatic cancer.
The Singh lab is a friendly, welcoming, and inclusive place with great excitement for cancer research. We plan to complete the recruitment process soon.
Interested candidates should submit their CV directly at Onc-Sci@ou.edu.
