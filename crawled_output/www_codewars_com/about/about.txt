You have not created any collections yet.
Collections are a way for you to organize kata so that you can create your own training routines.
Every collection you create is public and automatically sharable with other warriors.
After you have added a few kata to a collection you and others can train on the kata contained within the collection.
Get started now by creating a new collection.
You must wait until you have earned at least 20 honor before you can create new collections.
Set the name for your new collection. Remember, this is going to be visible by everyone so think of something that others will understand.
