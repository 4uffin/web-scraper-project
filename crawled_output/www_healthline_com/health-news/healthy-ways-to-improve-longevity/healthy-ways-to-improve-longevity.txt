Johner Images/Getty ImagesHuman longevity is affected by a complex number of factors, including lifestyle.Through modifiable lifestyle behaviors, including diet, exercise, and limiting sedentary behavior, you can improve longevity and quality of life during aging.As with any resolution, sustainability is key, so find ways to integrate healthy habits that will keep you engaged and happy.The science behind longevity — extending human life span — continues to improve year after year.Though we have yet to discover a veritable fountain of youth, research indicates that lifestyle choices, particularly diet and exercise, play an outsized role in determining whether or not we live long, healthy lives. That’s good news because it means that you are likely in better control of the factors that influence longevity than you think. While we still can’t change our genes, science indicates that genetic makeup is just one part of the complex puzzle of life span. Today, there is also more emphasis on healthy aging rather than just life extension.“The question we really should be asking and focusing on is what is healthy aging and healthspan, not life span,” Amanda Boyce, PhD., Health Scientist Administrator in the Division of Aging Biology, NIH’s National Institute on Aging, told Healthline.Healthline spoke with various experts in health and medicine to find the best, most actionable recommendations for living longer and aging gracefully in the new year. 5 science-backed ways to improve longevity in 2025Give your diet a Mediterranean or Japanese boostThe science is very consistent: when it comes to diets that improve longevity and prevent disease, the Mediterranean diet and the Japanese/Okinawan diet are the best. While they might seem worlds apart in terms of culture and geography, both emphasize similar dietary patterns. They are heavy on fish as a source of protein, which is rich in brain-boosting and heart-healthy fats. They also include plenty of whole vegetables (fresh or fermented) and limit heavily processed foods and sugar.“As we approach the new year, know that no one “quick fix diet” will be impactful. When we think about longevity, we must consider dietary patterns and changes that will provide long-lasting impact and, most importantly, are sustainable!” said Alyssa Kwan, MS, RD, Clinical Dietitian in Cardiology, Stanford Medicine.If you want to start changing your diet to better align with these practices but aren’t sure where to start, here are some simple tips. “Focus on one component at a time and make sure it’s something that fits within your personal, religious, and/or cultural preferences. For example, if you enjoy lentils, use them instead of white rice in veggie bowls. But if you dislike fish, then focus on other sources of protein,” said Kristin Kirkpatrick, MS, RD, a nutritionist at the Cleveland Clinic, and co-author of Regenerative Health.Shed those excess poundsObesity is linked to numerous chronic illnesses, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes, and yes, even a shorter lifespan. For many adult Americans, shedding a few excess pounds can be tremendously beneficial to longevity and overall health. But rather than just trying to lose weight, learn about the ideal body weight for your age, sex, and height. Losing even 5% of your body weight can significantly impact everything from blood sugar to blood pressure.“Maintaining a healthy weight across life stages is critical for healthy aging and for improving both lifespan and healthspan,” said Frank B. Hu, MD, PhD, professor and chair of the Department of Nutrition, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.“Clinical trials have shown that weight loss achieved through lifestyle changes, medications such as GLP-1 agonists, or weight loss surgeries is associated with a reduced risk of chronic diseases, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and certain cancers, and premature death,” said Hu.Cut down on sittingThere’s a good chance that you are sitting far more than is good for your health. That’s likely no fault of your own: you sit when you use a computer, watch TV, or meet friends at a coffee shop. But as our lives have become more sedentary, science has homed in on the negative effects that can have on longevity and disease risk. “Sedentary behavior, such as prolonged TV watching, has been associated with an increased risk of chronic diseases, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and premature death. This heightened risk is primarily attributed to increased obesity and the displacement of physical activity,” said Hu.Even if you exercise regularly, sedentary behavior has serious health risks associated with it. So don’t just think about trying to offset lazy days with a hard gym session. Think about ways to increase physical activity throughout the day, even if it just means taking a walk around your house or office, even if you are still exercising regularly.Exercise — the more, the betterRegular exercise is one of the best things you can do for your health. And it’s not just about your body either. The benefits extend to brain health and cognition, too. New research published in December 2024 found that among older adults, cardiorespiratory fitness was an excellent indicator of brain health across multiple domains of cognition, including memory.Finding ways to increase physical activity and cut down on sedentary time in a manner that is enjoyable is key to making the habit sustainable. As a starting point, the CDC recommends that adults get a minimum of 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity physical activity.“The two things in older adults that we see as a result of aging that lead to decreases in their quality of life are changes in cognition, and functionality, staying up on your feet. Exercise is far and away the thing that impacts both of them,” Katherine T. Ward, MD, clinical section chief of geriatrics at Stanford Medicine, told Healthline.Boyce adds that establishing habits that can reduce sedentary behaviors and increase activity at the same time is a great place to start.“You can also build physical activity into your everyday life. For instance, get off the train one stop early and walk or bundle behaviors like only watching TV while you’re exercising,” she said.Stop smokingYes, you’ve heard it before, but the science is as firm as ever: stop smoking, and you will live longer. Period. In a study led by Frank Hu and published in 2018, researchers found that “never” smoking was one of five key factors for prolonging life expectancy. The others were: maintaining a healthy weightregular physical activityhealthy dietonly consuming a moderate amount of alcoholCigarette smoking is associated with roughly one of every five deaths in the United States each year, amounting to more than 480,000 deaths annually.Why is smoking so deadly? It is linked to everything from cancer and heart disease to diabetes and COPD. Stopping smoking not only lowers your risk of all these diseases but can add as much as ten years to life expectancy.Expert recommendations for longevity in 2025Healthline asked the experts to give their top recommendation for longevity in 2025, and here’s what they said:“Maintaining a healthy body weight through diet and exercise is something that I have continually strived for,” said Hu.Ward told Healthline, “Whatever you’re doing for physical activity, add 30 more minutes to it.”“Move your body. Take a walk after dinner, have a family dance party, or try a new sport. Not only will it improve your health, hopefully, it will bring more joy into your life,” said Boyce.When it comes to eating healthy, think holistically about other behaviors, including exercise and sleep. Kirkpatrick emphasized, “Match your dietary pattern (not diet) to your why. If your ‘why’ is ‘I don’t want to get dementia like my mother did,’ for example, then pay attention to relevant supplements, adequate exercise, and a nutrient-specific pattern (along with enhancements in stress management and sleep).”“Overall, to improve longevity, think about sustainability. Consider other factors such as maximizing sleep, minimizing stress levels, and engaging in an active lifestyle ~150 minutes of physical activity weekly,” added Kwan.The bottom lineRather than looking for a quick fix, the science behind longevity suggests that healthy lifestyle habits, including diet and exercise, are most important.Getting active, losing weight, stopping smoking, eating a Mediterranean diet, and limiting sedentary behavior are keys to not only lengthening your life span but also increasing your quality of life or health span.Take small, sustainable steps across different aspects of your life to build habits that will last beyond 2025.How we reviewed this article:HistoryShare this articleWritten by Gigen Mammoser on January 2, 2025 — Fact checked by Jennifer Chesak, MSJRead this nextHealth Experts Debunk 6 Popular Myths About Holiday HabitsFrom skipping meals and exercise to overindulging in unhealthy food and drinks, experts weigh in on six of the most common health myths that…READ MOREHow a Surprising Diagnosis from My Cardiologist Led to Open-Heart SurgeryHealthline contributor and former editor David Mills shares how an annual checkup with his cardiologist resulted in a surprising diagnosis that…READ MOREThis Father of 3 Thought His Cough Was a Lingering Flu Symptom.
