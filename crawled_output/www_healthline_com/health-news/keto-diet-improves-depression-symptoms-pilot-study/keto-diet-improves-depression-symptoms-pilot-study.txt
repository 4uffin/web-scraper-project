Alexander Spatari/Getty ImagesA new pilot study reports that young adults experienced a 70% reduction in depression symptoms after following a ketogenic diet.Participants also reported improvements in cognitive performance, overall well-being, and modest weight loss.Researchers suggest that nutritional ketosis could potentially serve as an adjunctive therapy alongside medication and counseling.However, a keto diet is not a replacement for professional mental health support, and further research is needed before keto can be recommended as a standalone treatment.A new study from Ohio State University has found that following a ketogenic diet may help reduce depression symptoms in young adults. The pilot trial tracked 16 college students with major depressive disorder over 10–12 weeks and found that participants experienced a roughly 70% decrease in depression scores. They also experienced improvements in overall well-being, cognitive performance, and even modest weight loss.The 16 students who completed the pilot trial were receiving medication, counseling, or both for major depressive disorder (MDD) before beginning the keto diet. The findings suggest that attaining nutritional ketosis through diet is a feasible adjunctive therapy for depression and pave the way for a larger clinical trial. The findings were published on September 10 in Translational Psychiatry.Previous research has suggested that medications and counseling reduce depressive symptoms by about 50% in a similar time period.“A 70% drop in depression symptoms in just 10–12 weeks is impressive, especially alongside better well-being and memory, said Shelly Dar, a therapist specializing in anxiety and mood disorders. Dar wasn’t involved in the study.“But I’d stress that this was a small pilot without a control group, so we can’t say keto caused the change,” she told Healthline.Ketosis may improve brain functionThe effects of the ketogenic diet on neurological conditions like epilepsy are well established. Therefore, the potential brain health benefits of ketosis are of increasing interest to researchers.When the body is in a state of ketosis, the brain shifts from using glucose as its primary energy source to ketones, explained Mike Kocsis, founder of Balance My Hormones in the United Kingdom. Kocsis wasn’t involved in the new pilot study. “Ketones act as signaling molecules that can impact brain chemistry, he told Healthline. “This metabolic trigger may improve mitochondrial efficiency, lower inflammation, and stabilize blood sugar levels, all of which are linked to mood regulation.”Ketones may also support the cycle of GABA (a calming neurotransmitter), which may help lower anxiety and regulate emotions. “In the Ohio State study, the participants not only had lower depression scores but also showed better cognitive performance, which means overall brain function has improved,” Kocsis noted.Keto diet may support other mental health conditionsEmerging evidence suggests a ketogenic diet may support other mental health conditions.Early studies have examined the effects of the keto diet on various neurological and psychiatric conditions, including:schizophreniaADHDbipolar disorderParkinson’s diseaseAlzheimer’s diseaseIn a small 2024 study of three adults, complete remission of major depression and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) occurred within 7–12 weeks of therapeutic nutritional ketosis. Larger studies, of course, are needed to confirm these findings.Keto diet is not a substitute for treatmentThe results of the new pilot study are certainly encouraging, but the research has some limitations. Dar noted the findings show potential, not necessarily proof. Larger, more rigorous studies are needed before the keto diet should be recommended as a first-line treatment for depression.“In my therapy work, I see how much clients want practical options they can control themselves, so findings like this feel encouraging, even if we need more evidence,” she added. Still, the keto diet should not be viewed as a substitute for medication or professional help. “I see diet as an add-on, not a replacement,” Dar said. “In the study, students kept their usual medication and counselling. That’s the safe model; we don’t want people dropping therapy or antidepressants in favor of a restrictive diet,” she continued.According to Dar, there usually isn’t one single “fix” when it comes to treating depression.Kocsis agreed. “Dietary interventions such as keto should be seen as complementary, not replacements, for certain treatments,” he said.There are risks to consider, too. “Keto can be socially isolating, hard to stick to, and risky if you’ve ever struggled with disordered eating,” Dar said.“As a therapist, I’d be mindful of the psychological impact of restrictive eating. It can either empower someone or tip them into old, unhelpful patterns,” she noted.Getting help with depression If you’re experiencing symptoms associated with depression, remember that you’re not alone. Reach out to your doctor or a mental health professional for support.In some cases, counseling, therapy, medications like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), or a combination, may be needed.If your doctor recommends the keto diet to complement your mental health treatment, Kocsis said to transition gradually. “Slowly start to reduce carbs over 1-2 weeks rather than cutting them overnight, as this will help minimize ‘keto-flu’ symptoms like fatigue and headaches,” he advised. “It’s a good idea to focus on whole foods, plenty of non-starchy vegetables, healthy fats such as olive oil, nuts, and avocado, and quality protein sources to avoid nutrient gaps,” he added. Dar noted that other, less restrictive dietary patterns, such as increasing your intake of whole foods and following a Mediterranean-style diet, have been shown to help support mood.“What matters most is finding a sustainable routine that supports mental health without adding extra stress or pressure,” Dar said.Diet aside, Dar said not to underestimate the power of healthy habits like good sleep, exercise, therapy, social support, and cutting back on alcohol or illicit substances. “These are powerful tools for mood, and I’d encourage anyone to build those habits, whether or not they try keto,” she said. “Small consistent changes like better sleep or daily structure can be just as stabilizing as bigger interventions.”How we reviewed this article:HistoryShare this articleWritten by Victoria Stokes on September 12, 2025 — Fact checked by Jennifer Chesak, MSJRead this nextDoes the Keto Diet Cause or Relieve Depression?Written by SaVanna Shoemaker, MS, RDN, LDBecause the low carb, high fat ketogenic diet can affect the brain and nervous system, it may also affect your mood.
