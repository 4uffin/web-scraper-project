Danil Nevsky/StocksyNew research suggests that people who use their phone while sitting on the toilet are 46% more likely to develop hemorrhoids.The findings indicate that scrolling for longer periods of time on the toilet increases rectal vein pressure.Experts say constipation, straining, and prolonged sitting are contributing factors for hemorrhoids.Simple lifestyle changes, like more fiber, hydration, movement, and less scrolling, can help reduce the risk.Scrolling on your phone while sitting on the toilet may come with an uncomfortable side effect: a higher risk of hemorrhoids.A new study published on September 3 in PLOS One looked at the toilet habits of 125 adults undergoing colonoscopies at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. Nearly two-thirds admitted to scrolling while on the toilet, and those who did were found to be 46% more likely to develop hemorrhoids compared to those who didn’t. Researchers found that phone users tended to linger on the toilet significantly longer, often five minutes or more per visit. Toilet phone users also reported getting less physical activity overall, suggesting that both toilet and lifestyle habits may increase hemorrhoid risk.Toilet phone use and hemorrhoidsMichael J. Allen, MD, a family medicine and primary care physician at Houston Methodist Clear Lake, explained that sitting on the toilet for extended periods can put rectal veins under pressure. Allen wasn’t involved in the study.“Blood tends to pool, and that swelling makes hemorrhoids more likely,” he told Healthline. “Think of it like kinking a garden hose; the longer you do it, the more backpressure builds up.”The combination of sitting for prolonged periods of time and the leaning forward position that’s become synonymous with phone use could lead to straining and swelling.“This position causes continuous pressure on the delicate veins, resulting in swelling and increasing the chances of hemorrhoids developing,” Snieguole Geige, medical doctor at It’s Me & You Clinic, told Healthline. Geige was likewise not involved in the study. “It can’t be compared to sitting on a chair where the pelvis has some support,” she said. “As the pressure persists minute after minute, often without you even realizing it, these vascular cushions become engorged and stretched.”The main contributing factors to hemorrhoids are anything that increases pressure in the lower rectum. “The big ones are constipation, straining, sitting too long (whether on the toilet or at a desk), pregnancy, chronic diarrhea, and low fiber diets,” Allen said. “All of these make the veins swell and bulge, and that’s what creates hemorrhoids.”Hemorrhoid symptoms to watch out forWhile habits like scrolling can make hemorrhoids more likely, it’s important to recognize the signs early so you know when self-care is enough versus when it’s time to seek medical advice.“Most people notice itching, some discomfort, or swelling around the anus, and at times some blood after a bowel movement,” said Geige. ”Some patients also develop a sore lump that can easily be felt.” For most people, hemorrhoids are simply an uncomfortable ailment that can cause embarrassment. However, there are serious symptoms that can be cause for concern. Allen said you should see your doctor if you experience any of the following: persistent or heavy bleeding pain isn’t improving with over-the-counter measures symptoms last longer than a week dark, black, or tarry stoolsHow to reduce your risk of hemorrhoidsLeaving your phone out of the bathroom is an obvious choice to reduce your risk of hemorrhoids. If your phone must accompany you to the toilet, there are a few things you can do.Geige recommended placing a small footstool under your feet. “This brings your knees up slightly, putting your body in a better position to go without straining,” she explained. One of the best things you can do outside of the bathroom is eat foods that limit your risk of constipation.Allen noted that a high fiber diet is often key. “A high fiber diet softens stool and makes it easier to pass, reducing straining, while low fiber, processed foods can make constipation worse,” he said.“Increase your intake of dietary fiber,” he continued. “[Aim for] around 25–30 grams daily from fruits, vegetables, beans, and whole grains is a good target.”Hydration is also helpful. “Without enough fluid, fiber can ‘dry things out’ down there instead of helping,” Geige said. “I try to drink water regularly throughout the day, and I suggest patients anchor it to meals. Simply drinking a glass with breakfast, lunch, and dinner can make a real change over time,” she added.Finally, both experts agreed that exercise can help promote regularity and reduce the risk of constipation. Even light walking counts. “If you are lifting heavy things, make sure you bend at your knees and keep your back straight. Otherwise, you’re putting pressure right where you don’t need it,” Geige said.What are the treatment options for hemorrhoids?Hemorrhoids can be easily treated in most cases. “Mild cases often improve with over-the-counter creams or suppositories,” Allen explained. “Sitz baths can also be helpful, while cold compresses can ease swelling.” To dull the pain, he recommended oral pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen.While most mild cases can be managed at home, medical procedures may be necessary if symptoms are severe or recurrent, bleeding is significant, and conservative treatment has failed. “Procedures can include rubber band ligation, sclerotherapy, or surgical removal. However, it’s important to remember surgery is rare and reserved for stubborn cases,” Allen said.While hemorrhoids are very common, you can reduce your risk with small lifestyle tweaks. The bottom line? Eat more fiber, drink more water, and spend less time on your phone while on the toilet.
