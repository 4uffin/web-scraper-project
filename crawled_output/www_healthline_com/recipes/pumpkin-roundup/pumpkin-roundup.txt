on September 23, 2025Pumpkin spice latteHearty pumpkin chili and avocadoAutumn stew with pumpkin and chickpeasCurried pumpkin soup with crispy tofuPumpkin spice energy bitesTakeawayFall means that pumpkin season is here. Here are 5 recipes you can make with the nutritious fruit.In addition to being a defining seasonal food, pumpkin has a range of health benefits. It is associated with antioxidant, anticancer, and anti-inflammatory properties.Additionally, a 1-cup serving of cooked pumpkin contains over 200% of the daily recommended amount of vitamin A, which is important for supporting your immune system and eye health.You may have noticed pumpkin products returning to your local grocery store and thought, ” What can I make with that?” Read on for 5 delicious ideas.Pumpkin spice latteShare on PinterestCourtesy of WellosThere’s nothing that says “fall” more than a pumpkin spice latte. While most pumpkin spice lattes lack pumpkin as an ingredient, this particular recipe contains pumpkin puree.Simply prepare your coffee as you normally would — while this recipe calls for espresso, instant coffee can also work — and whisk in milk, pumpkin, maple syrup, cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla extract. Once everything is combined, blend until the mixture is frothy.For an iced coffee, you may consider adding ice to the mixture before blending. However, this will change the consistency of the drink.Get the recipe!Hearty pumpkin chili and avocadoShare on PinterestCourtesy of PlateJoyChili is a fall staple, and this one includes pumpkin. It is bursting with warm spices and tender produce, including yellow onions, carrots, red bell peppers, jalapeños, tomatoes, garlic, pumpkin puree, and kidney beans. It is topped with avocado and lime juice.It is important to note that this recipe is high in sodium, with 1,850 grams (g) per serving. If you are looking to reduce the amount of sodium in this recipe, you may consider substituting the vegetable broth with low sodium vegetable broth. You can also exclude the “salt to taste.” You can also use half of the amount of broth the recipe calls for and replace the other half with water.Moreover, it is important to rinse the canned kidney beans with water before using them. Canned vegetables often have added sodium, which rinsing can remove. Using low sodium or no-salt-added canned kidney beans also reduces the sodium intake.Get the recipe!Autumn stew with pumpkin and chickpeasShare on PinterestCourtesy of PlateJoyThis stew combines pumpkin puree, chickpeas, carrots, yellow onions, orzo, and fresh sage, simmering them together to create a comforting dish for fall. It is low in calories, sodium, and saturated fat while high in fiber.This recipe is vegan, but it still contains 17 g of protein. If you want to add an additional protein source, you may consider topping the stew with shredded rotisserie chicken. Keep in mind that this will change the nutritional values of this dish.Get the recipe!Curried pumpkin soup with crispy tofuShare on PinterestCourtesy of PlateJoyAnother vegan recipe, this soup contains seasonings like curry powder, ground coriander, and red pepper flakes, complementing the crispy tofu.Coconut milk and vegetable broth serve as the base for this soup, but if you aren’t a fan of coconut, don’t worry. The coconut milk adds creaminess to the soup without adding a coconut flavor.Coconut milk is sometimes found in the dairy section of the grocery store in cartons or in cans in shelf-stable aisles. When choosing coconut milk, look for a version without added sugars. You may also experiment with other nondairy milks.Get the recipe!Pumpkin spice energy bitesShare on PinterestCourtesy of PlateJoyIdeal for a quick snack in a pinch, these pumpkin spice energy bites can be taken with you to the office, school, sports practice, or wherever you need to be.Simply combine pitted dates, shredded coconut, flax meal, maple syrup, protein powder, vanilla, pumpkin pie spice, almond butter, and coconut oil in a food processor. After chilling the mixture in the refrigerator for 30 minutes, form into 1-inch balls.Each serving is 2 balls. Store in the fridge until ready to eat.Protein powdersLooking for a protein powder to use?

It contains important nutrients that can help reduce the risk of developing chronic diseases.Pumpkin can be used to create both sweet and savory dishes, as well as a wide range of dishes that can include meals and treats.  How we reviewed this article:SourcesHistoryHealthline has strict sourcing guidelines and relies on peer-reviewed studies, academic research institutions, and medical journals and associations.
