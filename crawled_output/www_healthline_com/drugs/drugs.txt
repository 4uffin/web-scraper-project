In most cases, they provide the same therapeutic benefits.
A brand-name drug has been developed by a pharmaceutical company, which must conduct clinical studies to prove the drug’s safety and efficacy. Because these studies can be very expensive, the pharmaceutical company receives an exclusive patent on the medication for several years, which can increase the price of the drug as the company works to recover their research costs.
Generic medications can enter the market after a brand-name drug’s patent has expired. Generic drugs must meet the same quality, safety, and effectiveness standards as the brand-name drug.
Generic drugs are often significantly cheaper than brand-name drugs. If your doctor prescribes a brand-name medication, ask if a generic version may be available to help lower your costs. However, not all drugs are available as generics.

How can I travel with my medications?It’s important to take your medication as your doctor prescribes, including when you’re traveling.
The Transportation Safety Administration (TSA) provides guidance for bringing medications on a plane. You may bring any amount of medication through security, either in your checked luggage or carry-on bag. This includes liquid medications, which may exceed the limit of 3.4 ounces for other liquids. However, let the security officers know that your bag contains medically necessary liquids.
If you have diabetes, notify TSA officers of any needles or other sensitive equipment you may be traveling with. If you have a glucose monitor, insulin pump, or other device on your body, let the security team know before you begin screening.

Can I drink alcohol while taking my medication?Every drug has potential interactions, including with alcohol. It’s always best to consult with your prescribing doctor or pharmacist about how alcohol may interact with the medication you’re taking.
In some cases, consuming alcohol with prescription drugs can cause harmful side effects, such as drowsiness, vomiting, fainting, or loss of coordination. Additionally, alcohol may interfere with how a medication works, making it less effective.
