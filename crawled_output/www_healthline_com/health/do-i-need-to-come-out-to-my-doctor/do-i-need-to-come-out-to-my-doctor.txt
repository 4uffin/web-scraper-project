on June 30, 2025ImpactBenefitsRisksHow toResourcesTakeawayWhether you discuss your sex life or gender identity with a healthcare professional is entirely up to you. Coming out is a deeply personal decision, and there isn’t a “right” way or one-size-fits-all approach.Routine healthcare involves more than just describing symptoms or reviewing test results. For many people, it means deciding whether to share intimate details about identity, orientation, or relationships.Being open with your healthcare professional can lead to more accurate diagnoses, tailored care, and a stronger, more affirming relationship. But sharing this part of yourself can make you feel vulnerable, especially if you’re unsure whether your provider is knowledgeable, respectful, or supportive of people with LGBTQIA+ identities.This article will help you navigate the decision to come out in a medical setting. We’ll explore when it might improve your quality of care, when it may not be the best time, and how to approach the convo in a way that prioritizes your safety and well-being.Why it mattersLGBTQIA+ individuals have many of the same healthcare needs as people who are cisgender and heterosexual. However, these communities also experience unique health risks that are often worsened by stigma, discrimination, and limited access to care.For example, lesbian, gay, and bisexual adults are twice as likely to be diagnosed with a mental health condition compared to heterosexual adults, while transgender adults are almost four times as likely.These aren’t just statistics; they reflect real barriers to care that can affect your physical and emotional well-being.Discussing sexual behavior, sexual orientation, and gender identity with your healthcare professional allows them to better understand your needs, screen for relevant conditions, and offer support and resources you may not otherwise receive.Potential benefitsPersonalized, whole-person careHealthcare is most effective when your physician knows who you are. If you aren’t open about your sexuality or gender, your healthcare professional may make inaccurate assumptions about your behaviors, relationships, or medical history.Open, honest conversations can help you get the support you actually need rather than a generic care plan.Improved screening and prevention People who are LGBTQIA+ may be more likely to develop certain conditions than their cisgender or heterosexual counterparts. This includes:anxietydepressiondisordered eating or eating disordersheart diseaseHIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs)HPV-related cancerssubstance use disorderssuicidalityDisclosing this information helps your doctor recommend the right tests and treatments based on your actual risk, not assumed ones.Stronger doctor-patient relationshipTrust is key in healthcare. Being able to speak openly about who you are can strengthen your connection with your healthcare professional.That comfort can lead to better communication and more frequent check-ins, both of which are linked to better health outcomes.Decreased stress and anxietyHiding a major part of yourself takes energy. Constantly filtering your words or avoiding topics like relationships, partners, or gender expression, for example, can be mentally exhausting. If you’re in a safe environment to do so, coming out can help relieve some of that pressure.Better coordination across your medical teamYour care doesn’t just involve one doctor. When your identity and experience are accurately reflected in your medical records, the rest of your care team — including specialists, nurses, and administrative staff — can also provide more respectful and informed care.Potential risksBreach of privacyIn most healthcare settings, your sexual orientation and gender identity are protected under privacy laws like HIPAA. That means your healthcare professional can’t legally share that information without your consent.But there are still situations where information can be seen by others, like if you’re on a shared insurance plan and a parent or significant other sees the billing details. That can lead to accidental outing, especially for teens or people in unsupportive environments.It’s worth asking your healthcare professional or their office staff about how your information is handled, especially if you’re concerned about confidentiality.DiscriminationLegal protections don’t always guarantee emotional safety. Even if the information is kept private, you might still worry about being judged or treated differently in subtle ways.If you suspect a healthcare professional may be biased or uninformed, you can hold back, ask careful questions first, or look for a more affirming option.Mandatory reportingIn most cases, what you discuss stays between you and your healthcare professional. However, they’re required to report to local authorities if they believe you’re at risk of harm to yourself or others or are being hurt by someone else.This can be tricky if the incident in question involves or relates to your sexual orientation or gender identity in any way. If you’re unsure about your healthcare professional’s role as a mandatory reporter, it’s a good idea to ask for clarification before sharing anything confidential.What to do nextComing out to your healthcare professional isn’t an all-or-nothing step. Here’s how to move forward in a way that feels safe and intentional for you.Decide what you want to shareKnowing what you want to discuss — whether during your next appointment or at a later date — can help you find a compatible healthcare professional.This might include one or more of the following:whether you bind your chest or tuck your genitalsthe anatomy of your sexual partnerswhat sex acts you or your partners performwhether you practice monogamy or non-monogamythe potential for pregnancywhat safer sex practices you use, such as condoms or other barrier methodsCall aheadYou can call a healthcare professional’s office anonymously and ask: Does your practice have experience working with people who are LGBTQIA+? Do staff receive LGBTQIA+ cultural competency training? Is there an LGBTQIA+ affirming or nondiscrimination policy in place? Bring a friend or loved one with youIf you’re nervous, it’s okay to bring someone you trust to the appointment, especially for your first visit. They can help advocate for you or provide moral support.Look for signsAt the office, observe the space: Are there brochures or posters welcoming people of all identities?Do intake forms allow for chosen names, pronouns, or identities beyond “male” and “female”? Are gender-neutral bathrooms available? Take note of how receptionists, nurses, and doctors interact with you: Do they use your correct name and pronouns? Are they respectful when asking personal questions?Do they use adopt the terms you use to refer to different body parts or behaviors?Start the conversationIf you brought a sexual or romantic partner, introducing them as such may be an easy way to come out indirectly. You can also slip this information into the conversation when you’re asked about your medical or sexual history.If you’re comfortable being direct, you might say something like: “I have some questions about gender affirming care. Is that something you have experience with or are comfortable discussing?”A healthcare professional who listens and shows a willingness to learn is worth your time. If someone seems flustered, dismissive, or unsure, it’s a good idea to move on. Depending on your circumstances, this could mean dropping the subject and continuing with your current standard of care or finding a new healthcare professional to work with.»FIND CARE:Find a healthcare professional in your area today.How to find an affirming healthcare professional or file a complaintReferrals from friends and folks at your local LGBTQIA+ center are great places to start. You can also consult directories from the following organizations:Human Rights CampaignNational LGBT Cancer NetworkOutCareWorld Professional Association for Transgender HealthIt’s important to note that if you’re mistreated, you can file a complaint with the healthcare facility, your state medical board, or the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office for Civil Rights.The bottom lineBeing open about your sexuality and gender can lead to better, more accurate care and a more trusting relationship. It can also make your experience in the medical system less stressful and more empowering. However, if it doesn’t feel safe right now, that’s okay too. Protecting yourself is part of caring for yourself. Keep looking for providers who affirm and respect your full identity, and know that the decision to come out is always yours. How we reviewed this article:SourcesHistoryHealthline has strict sourcing guidelines and relies on peer-reviewed studies, academic research institutions, and medical journals and associations.
