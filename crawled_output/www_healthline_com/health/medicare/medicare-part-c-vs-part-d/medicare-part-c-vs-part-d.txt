Updated on September 19, 2025About Part CAbout Part DCan you enroll in both C and D?TakeawayKey takeawaysMedicare Part C, also known as Medicare Advantage, includes the coverage of Part A and Part B along with extra benefits like vision, dental, and prescription drug coverage.Medicare Part D is optional prescription drug coverage for those with Original Medicare, certain Medicare cost plans, and some Medicare Private Fee-for-Service plans.You generally cannot enroll in both Medicare Part C and Part D simultaneously. Enrolling in a Part D plan while having a Part C plan with drug coverage will typically disenroll you from Part C and revert you to Original Medicare.Medicare Part C and Part D are two of the four primary parts of Medicare. These are:Medicare Part A (hospital insurance)Medicare Part B (medical insurance)Medicare Part C (Medicare Advantage)Medicare Part D (prescription drug coverage)Most Medicare Advantage plans include Medicare Part D coverage.If you’re trying to decide between adding a stand-alone Part D plan to Original Medicare (parts A and B) or buying a Medicare Advantage plan that includes drug coverage, this article can help.Read on to learn what each plan covers, the costs, and what to consider when choosing the best plan for you.What is Medicare Part C?Medicare Part C plans are offered by Medicare-approved private insurance companies. They’re all-in-one style plans that give buyers options to tailor their healthcare coverage.Medicare Part C plans provide all the benefits of Part A and Part B but also offer benefits like dental, vision, and prescription drug coverage.CostUnlike Original Medicare, which has fixed costs for beneficiaries, Part C plans have variable costs based on factors such as the insurer, the plan, and your location.Typically, you’ll pay a separate monthly premium, but not all Medicare Advantage plans have monthly premiums. When considering Medicare Part C, compare both the benefits and the costs. EligibilityIf you’re enrolled in Original Medicare (parts A and B), you’re eligible to sign up for a Medicare Advantage plan. What is Medicare Part D?Medicare Part D is an optional benefit for all people who have Medicare. It adds drug coverage to:Original Medicaresome Medicare cost planssome Medicare Private Fee-for-Service (PFFS) plansMedicare savings accountsCostsThe monthly premium you pay for Medicare Part D varies by plan. But in 2026, the national base beneficiary premium is $38.99. Those earning a higher income may pay more for this coverage.Additionally, Part D plans have an out-of-pocket spending limit for covered drugs. In 2025, this limit is $2,000, and in 2026, it is $2,100.EligibilityYou’re eligible for Medicare Part D when you become eligible and sign up for Medicare. If you didn’t sign up for Medicare Part D when you were first eligible, you may be required to pay a late enrollment penalty for the entire time you continue with Part D. You can also avoid it if you qualify for Medicare’s Extra Help program by meeting certain income and resource limits.»Read more:Part D Late Enrollment PenaltyCan you enroll in both Medicare Part C and Part D?You cannot have both parts C and D. If you have a Medicare Advantage (Part C) plan that includes prescription drug coverage and you join a Medicare prescription drug plan (Part D), you’ll be unenrolled from Part C and sent back to Original Medicare.The CMS has a Medicare plan finder at Medicare.gov to help you get specific information on available drug plans and Medicare Advantage plans.You have a choice of using this plan finder in either English or Spanish.The takeawayIf you’re eligible for Medicare and want or need prescription drug coverage, you can get it through Medicare Part D. Or you can also get it through a Medicare Advantage plan (Medicare Part C) that offers coverage for prescription medication. Before committing to one or the other, review cost and coverage details to make sure you have a plan that best suits your healthcare needs and your budget.The information on this website may assist you in making personal decisions about insurance, but it is not intended to provide advice regarding the purchase or use of any insurance or insurance products.
