Updated on January 9, 2025Part BPart CPart DTakeawayPart D covers most preventive vaccinations, while Part B covers a few specific vaccines, like the pneumonia vaccine. Medicare Advantage plans, sometimes called Part C, also cover the pneumonia vaccine.Pneumococcal vaccines can prevent common bacterial infections from Streptococcus pneumoniae. There are two types of pneumonia vaccines available to prevent specific strains of this bacteria.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that adults ages 65 years or older receive the pneumococcal conjugate vaccination (PCV15 or PCV20).If you receive PCV15, it should be followed by a dose of pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23).Part B coverage and costsPart B is medical insurance. It covers preventive healthcare services such as doctor visits, screening and diagnostic tests, and some vaccinations, such as the pneumonia vaccine.In 2025, most people will pay a monthly premium of $185.00. Your premium may be higher depending on your income.After you pay a $257 deductible, you’ll generally pay 20% of all Medicare-approved costs for covered services. However, there are no out-of-pocket costs for vaccines covered by Part B.That means you’ll pay $0 for the pneumonia vaccine if you go to a healthcare professional who accepts Medicare assignment.Providers who accept assignment agree to Medicare-approved rates, which are usually lower than standard prices. You can use this tool to find a Medicare-approved provider near you.Part C coverage and costsPart C plans must cover the same basic services as Original Medicare (parts A and B), including certain vaccinations.That means the pneumonia vaccine is covered at no out-of-pocket cost to you, aside from your plan’s monthly premium.Each Part C plan sets its own cost and coverage amounts. Your premiums, deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance amounts depend on your chosen plan.Staying in network, which means getting care from a list of approved healthcare professionals and facilities, usually costs less than going out of network.When it comes to no-cost services like the pneumonia vaccine, you’ll likely need to stay in network to avoid being charged the full cost.Part D coverage and costsPart D is prescription drug coverage. It’s typically included in Medicare Advantage, so you usually can’t enroll in a separate Part D plan. However, it can be purchased as an add-on to Original Medicare.Although Part D can be a beneficial complement to your Part A and B coverage, it doesn’t cover the pneumonia vaccine. Your Part B plan will pick up the cost of the pneumonia vaccine.The bottom lineUnder Part B, Medicare will cover the cost of the pneumonia vaccine, regardless of whether you need one shot or two. You’ll pay $0 out of pocket if you see a Medicare-approved healthcare professional.
