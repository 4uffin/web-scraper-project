(An active ingredient is what makes a drug work.) A generic version of the drug isn’t currently available.What is Mounjaro used for?Mounjaro is used along with exercise and a balanced diet to help manage blood sugar levels in adults with type 2 diabetes.Type 2 diabetes is a condition that causes high blood sugar.

Some side effects may be temporary, especially mild side effects. For example, nausea, diarrhea, or constipation might last for a few days or weeks after you start Mounjaro.Other side effects can be long term, particularly serious side effects like pancreatitis (swelling and inflammation of the pancreas) or severe digestive problems that can lead to kidney damage.

Other symptoms of gallbladder problems include fever, nausea, and vomiting.If you develop body aches or pain during your Mounjaro treatment, call your doctor right away. They can determine what may be causing your symptoms and the best way to treat them. But if you think you’re having a medical emergency, call 911 or your local emergency number.Is Mounjaro used for weight loss?Mounjaro is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use as a weight loss drug. But because the drug is prescribed along with exercise and a balanced diet, some people may lose weight during their Mounjaro treatment.Your doctor may also prescribe Mounjaro off-label for weight management. (Off-label use of a drug is when your doctor prescribes a medication for a different use than what it was approved for.)In studies, some people using Mounjaro reported weight loss. This may be due to the drug working to slow down your digestion, which can help you feel full for a longer time. Decreasing blood sugar levels and improving the body’s response to insulin helps manage type 2 diabetes better, which may also aid in weight loss. In addition, this drug can cause nausea or decreased appetite, which can lead to weight loss.Mounjaro contains the active ingredient tirzepatide. (An active ingredient is what makes a drug work.) Another drug, Zepbound, also contains the same active ingredient and is approved for weight loss. It’s prescribed along with exercise and a balanced diet. Your doctor can advise you on whether Zepbound may be a suitable alternative to Mounjaro for weight loss.If you have questions about weight loss with Mounjaro, talk with your doctor.Is Mounjaro insulin?No, Mounjaro is not insulin. It’s a type of drug called a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist. Mounjaro is the first GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist drug.Although Mounjaro and insulin have different effects on the body, Mounjaro does increase how sensitive your body is to insulin. Mounjaro also signals your pancreas to make more insulin after you eat. For details about how Mounjaro works, talk with your doctor or pharmacist.Mounjaro is often prescribed with insulin for type 2 diabetes treatment. You can see examples of insulin that may be prescribed with Mounjaro under “Using Mounjaro with other drugs” in the “How is Mounjaro used?” section later in this article.If you have questions about how Mounjaro compares with insulin, talk with your doctor or pharmacist.What is Mounjaro’s dosage?Your doctor will recommend the dosage of Mounjaro that’s right for you. The dosages discussed here are commonly used, but always use the dosage your doctor prescribes.Form and strengthsMounjaro comes as a liquid solution that’s given as an injection under your skin using single-dose, prefilled pens.Mounjaro is available in the following strengths:2.5 milligrams (mg) per 0.5 milliliters (mL)5 mg/0.5 mL7.5 mg/0.5 mL10 mg/0.5 mL12.5 mg/0.5 mL15 mg/0.5 mLRecommended dosagesYou’ll inject Mounjaro once per week. Your doctor will likely have you start treatment with a 2.5-mg dose of Mounjaro. After 4 weeks of treatment, they’ll increase your dose to 5 mg per week. Starting with a lower dose helps your body get used to the medication.If your current dose of Mounjaro isn’t managing your blood sugar well enough, your doctor may increase your dose even more. This will be done after another period of 4 weeks, and in increments of 2.5 mg, if needed. For Mounjaro, 15 mg per week is the maximum dosage.For details about Mounjaro’s dosage, you can refer to this Mounjaro dosage article.Questions about Mounjaro’s dosingHere are some common questions about Mounjaro’s dosing.What if I miss a dose of Mounjaro? If you miss your dose of Mounjaro, take it as soon as you remember, as long as it’s within 4 days of when the dose was due. Then continue with your regular dosing schedule. But if more than 4 days have passed since you missed your dose, skip your missed dose and take your next dose on its usual day. Then, continue with your regular dosing schedule. (You should take your Mounjaro doses at least 72 hours apart.)Will I need to use Mounjaro long term? Yes, you’ll likely use Mounjaro long term. This drug helps manage type 2 diabetes, which is a long-term condition. So, if Mounjaro works for you, your doctor will likely recommend using it long term.How long does Mounjaro take to work? Mounjaro begins working right after you inject your first dose, but it may take some time before you see a change in your blood sugar level. Some people start seeing an effect within a few weeks of starting treatment. If you have questions about when you can expect to see results with Mounjaro, talk with your doctor.How is Mounjaro used?Your doctor will explain how to use Mounjaro. They’ll also explain how much to inject and how often. Be sure to follow your doctor’s instructions.Using MounjaroMounjaro comes as a liquid solution in a single-use prefilled pen. You’ll inject Mounjaro under your skin once weekly. You can take your dose with or without food.Mounjaro can be injected into your abdomen, thigh, or upper arm. (If you want the drug injected into your upper arm, you’ll need someone else to give you the injection.) You should rotate the areas where you inject the drug to help prevent skin irritation at the injection site.Before you start your Mounjaro treatment, your doctor or pharmacist can show you how to inject the drug. For step-by-step instructions or a video on how to use Mounjaro, see the drug manufacturer’s website.It’s important to note that if you take insulin along with Mounjaro, you can inject your doses into the same area of your body, such as your thigh. But try to use different injection sites that are a few inches apart to avoid injection site reactions, such as pain or irritation. Also, you should never mix insulin with Mounjaro in the same syringe.If you have questions about the administration of Mounjaro, talk with your doctor or pharmacist.Accessible medication containers and labelsCertain pharmacies may provide medication labels that:have large printuse braillecontain a code you can scan with a smartphone to change the text into audioYour doctor or pharmacist may be able to recommend a pharmacy that offers these options if your current pharmacy doesn’t.Using Mounjaro with other drugsYour doctor may prescribe other drugs along with Mounjaro to help manage your blood sugar levels.

This can be serious or even life threatening if not treated quickly.As a result, your doctor may monitor your blood sugar levels more often if you use Mounjaro with other treatments. In some cases, your doctor may decrease the doses of your other diabetes medications to help prevent low blood sugar.Questions about taking MounjaroHere are some common questions about using Mounjaro.Should I take Mounjaro with food?

This is the most serious warning from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It alerts doctors and patients about drug effects that may be dangerous.Risk of thyroid cancer: Using Mounjaro may raise the risk of developing thyroid cancer. In studies, animals given Mounjaro had an increased risk of thyroid cancer. But it’s not known whether Mounjaro could cause thyroid cancer, specifically medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), in humans.If you or a family member has a history of MTC or if you have multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN 2), tell your doctor before using Mounjaro. Due to the associated risks, they’ll likely recommend a different treatment option for you.During your Mounjaro treatment, you should watch for symptoms of thyroid cancer.

These are known as drug-condition interactions. Other factors may also affect whether Mounjaro is a good treatment option for you.Talk with your doctor about your health history before you use Mounjaro. Factors to consider include those described here.Pancreatitis: Mounjaro can cause pancreatitis. If you’ve had this condition before, your risk of developing pancreatitis with Mounjaro may be higher. Before using Mounjaro, talk with your doctor about whether Mounjaro is safe for you to use.Kidney problems: Mounjaro can cause digestive problems that lead to dehydration and kidney problems. If you already have kidney problems, using Mounjaro could worsen your condition. Before using this drug, talk with your doctor. If they prescribe Mounjaro, your doctor may monitor your kidneys closely during your treatment.Diabetic retinopathy: If you have a vision problem called diabetic retinopathy, using Mounjaro could make it worse. If you have this condition, talk with your doctor before starting your Mounjaro treatment. Your doctor may monitor your vision more closely during your treatment.Severe digestion problems: Before starting treatment with Mounjaro, tell your doctor if you have any severe digestion problems, such as gastroparesis. Mounjaro has not been studied in people who have severe digestive problems, so your doctor will likely recommend a different treatment option for you.Planned surgery with general anesthesia: It’s possible for Mounjaro to cause pulmonary aspiration (accidental inhalation of substances such as liquid from the stomach) in people who have general anesthesia for surgery. Although studies did not report this side effect, it was reported after Mounjaro became available to prescribe.If you have an upcoming surgery, let your doctor know before starting Mounjaro. Also let your doctor know if you need surgery during Mounjaro treatment.Oral birth control use: Mounjaro may interact with birth control pills, making the birth control less effective. Your doctor may recommend that you use a barrier method of contraception, such as a condom, along with your birth control pills. You may need to do this for 4 weeks after starting Mounjaro and for 4 weeks after any dosage increases during your treatment.Allergic reaction: If you’ve had an allergic reaction to Mounjaro or any of its ingredients, your doctor will likely not prescribe Mounjaro for you. Ask them about other medications that might be better options.Mounjaro and alcoholIt should be safe to drink alcohol during your Mounjaro treatment. But combining Mounjaro with alcohol could increase the risk of certain Mounjaro side effects or make them worse.Drinking alcohol can also cause hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) or hide symptoms of this condition in people with diabetes. This can be dangerous if not treated quickly. For this reason, drinking alcohol with Mounjaro could be risky.If you drink alcohol, talk with your doctor about how much, if any, may be safe to drink with your condition and treatment plan.Pregnancy and breastfeedingIf you can become pregnant or are breastfeeding, it’s important to consider whether Mounjaro is a safe choice for you. For more information, you can refer to this Mounjaro pregnancy and breastfeeding article.
