Updated on September 22, 2025FoodsEffectivenessAlternativesFAQTakeawayFoods rich in tryptophan may boost the production of serotonin in the brain. These foods include eggs, some hard cheeses, soy-based products, turkey, and more.Serotonin is a natural neurotransmitter (brain messenger) and hormone associated with mood regulation. Doctors consider serotonin levels to be a key factor in overall mental health. While some people may require medication to regulate their levels, some foods may help boost its production.If you’re taking medication for anxiety and depression, ask a healthcare professional about increasing your intake of serotonin-boosting foods. High levels of serotonin may pose health risks.Serotonin-boosting foodsCertain foods are good sources of tryptophan, an essential amino acid your body needs but can’t produce. Serotonin is synthesized (made) from tryptophan.Here are seven foods high in tryptophan that may help regulate serotonin levels.EggsAccording to a 2018 research review citing older studies, the protein content in eggs can help boost blood plasma levels of tryptophan.Just make sure you don’t leave out the yolks, which are rich in this amino acid, along with:tyrosinecholinebiotinomega-3 fatty acidsCheeseCheese (and other dairy products) are excellent sources of tryptophan. Cottage cheese and hard cheeses, such as Parmesan, Gouda, and Cheddar, are particularly rich in this essential amino acid.Dairy also provides some calcium and protein to help keep your bones healthy and your stomach feeling full.Soy productsSoy products, such as tofu, are rich sources of tryptophan (and almost all other nine essential amino acids).You can use tofu in place of pretty much any protein. This way, you can also enjoy some of tryptophan’s benefits even if you follow a vegan or vegetarian diet.Some tofu is also calcium-fortified, meaning that the manufacturer has added calcium, providing a great calcium boost for your bones.SalmonIt’s true that salmon is high in tryptophan. You can also find a healthy dose of omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin D in salmon, both of which help support healthy:bonesskineye functionmusclesSalmon also has other potential health benefits, including helping to manage cholesterol and lower blood pressure.Nuts and seedsPick and choose your favorites because all nuts and seeds contain some tryptophan. They’re also good sources of:fibervarious vitaminsantioxidantsA 2018 research review also indicates that eating a moderate amount of nuts regularly may help lower the risk of heart disease by improving lipid and apolipoprotein profiles.Just a small handful of nuts and seeds almost daily is enough. Keep in mind that nuts are high in calories.TurkeyTurkey — and any animal meat for that matter — is considered a complete protein, meaning it contains all nine essential amino acids, including tryptophan.Serotonin and your diet: Does it work?Tryptophan isn’t a magical nutrient that boosts serotonin levels or suddenly improves mood. Many factors are at play, and research on this topic is still emerging.However, tryptophan-rich foods may help, especially if you combine them with carbohydrates.Carbs cause your body to release more insulin, signaling amino acid absorption and leaving tryptophan in your blood for longer. Mixing high tryptophan foods with carbs may give you a temporary serotonin boost.Still, this may not be enough to regulate your mood, especially if you have a chronic condition like depression or another mood disorder.Other ways to boost serotoninFood isn’t the only natural way to improve serotonin levels. These may also help:Exercise: A 2024 research review suggests that physical activity may have antidepressant effects.Sunshine: Light therapy and natural sunshine are common remedies for seasonal depression. According to a 2019 research review, bright light therapy is associated with increased serotonin levels and mood stabilization.Pre- and probiotics: Try a high fiber diet (fiber is a prebiotic) to feed healthy gut bacteria, which may affect serotonin levels through the gut-brain axis. Supplemental probiotics may also be of value.Frequently asked questionsWhat foods help boost serotonin the most?Eggs, salmon, cheese, tofu, nuts and seeds, and turkey are among the highest sources of tryptophan, essential for serotonin production.These foods are also great sources of more nutrients, including protein, vitamins, and other essential amino acids.﻿Eggs, salmon, cheese, tofu, nuts and seeds, and turkey are among the highest sources of tryptophan, essential for serotonin production.These foods are also great sources of more nutrients, including protein, vitamins, and other essential amino acids.﻿Should I take tryptophan supplements?It’s best to consult a healthcare professional first.
