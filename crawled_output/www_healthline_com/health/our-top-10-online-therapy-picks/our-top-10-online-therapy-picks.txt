The different methods of communications they offer cater to a number of different people.

She said the sign-up process was quick and easy. “I felt the survey asked the right questions about my mental health history and current status without getting long-winded.”Once matched with a therapist, she said, they got in touch with her quickly and helped her with discussing a specific situation at hand. “But I will say that I got a lot of automated or copy-and-pasted messages from her that I presumed she may have sent to all of her clients, like when she’d be unavailable.”Christy liked the scheduling freedom, whether someone is in need of weekly sessions or daily messages for a deeper level of support.

(The company states it’s not for people who are at imminent risk of self-harm and in need of emergency services.) The purpose of the program is to fill the gap between routine services and emergency room visits. Brightside offers remote care only. Its therapy and medication plans are currently available in all 50 states, except for Crisis Care, which is only available in select states.Coverage and costs vary because Brightside plans can be paid monthly without insurance, except for Crisis Care, which can only be paid for through insurance.

There wasn’t any filtering, and other than their credentials (which aren’t necessarily easy for a layman to make sense of), there was no other information explicitly called out in their profiles.“I didn’t really like how selecting my therapist was based off my schedule rather than [indicating that it was] matching me with therapists that were a good fit with my questionnaire results.”Laramy shared that “being shown all the therapists available on a given day wasn’t very helpful for me — it felt like the burden of picking (and thus the worry about picking wrong) was placed fully with me, and I found myself stressing about which therapist I should select.“Their bios did provide a personal statement, which was somewhat helpful in choosing — but honestly, even with my lower level of anxiety, I was feeling plenty anxious trying to make that choice!”She said the therapist matching was centered on the specific day you’d want a session, and results are sorted accordingly. This didn’t seem so helpful to her.Laramy did find Brightside’s focus on depression and anxiety comforting, though. She also appreciated the “homework” sent via the chat function was helpful if you’re on mobile or the app directly.Overall, she said, “This service seems like good value for someone who’s seeking to put in the work to get targeted anxiety or depression help, and likely even better value for someone who’s also looking for psychiatry to pair with it.“I think it would feel overpriced if you were just looking for more of an emotional outlet with therapy, or a more casual therapeutic experience.”Laramy Applekamp tried Brightside Health for about 3 weeks and attended two sessions with two different therapists plus several of Brightside’s “lessons.”Though Laramy praises a quick sign-up, she notes being matched to a therapist was not tailored enough for her liking.“It was hard for me to easily see whether any of the therapists I could sign up with specialized in different things without clicking into each bio and reading it.

The platform features a user-friendly interface, allowing users to easily search for therapists based on criteria such as state, insurance provider, specialty, and more. It is also one of the few online therapy platforms that accepts Medicaid.The platform’s unique feature is the option to search for in-person therapy, which is good for those who prefer traditional face-to-face sessions. This feature allows users to select a therapist based on specific criteria and learn about them before the first session.Grow Therapy has rapidly expanded its coverage and services, starting with just five states and now serving all 50 states, including Washington, D.C., with plans for further expansion.The service accepts most major health insurances, so many users can access quality therapy for a copay of $20 or less.

In 2016, it added mental health services and psychiatry to its platform. Now, with the expertise of doctors and psychiatrists, it’s one of the best places for online psychiatry.After your assessment and inputting your insurance information, MDLive lets you navigate its platform to see and choose a psychiatrist who meets your standards. Psychiatrists are available on weekends and evenings, and professionals are on call 24/7 for around-the-clock mental health care.Without insurance, MDLive’s by-session cost for psychiatry starts at $299 for the initial session. From there, each follow-up appointment is $159 before insurance.With insurance, MDLive’s copays can start as low as $0. MDLive accepts insurance, Medicare, and Medicaid, so it’s accessible to many folks.One thing of note: Like most telehealth platforms, MDLive cannot prescribe controlled substances.Our score breakdownMental Health Professionals3.5Payment & Insurance5.5Privacy & Security5Communication3Quality Indicators4.8What our tester saysContent warning: Mentions of childhood sexual abuse, sexual traumaMatilda Teal* used MDLive’s therapy and psychiatry services. Teal was looking for a therapist who had a specialty in sexual trauma. She was abused as a child and wanted support through bringing her abuser to trial as well as an official diagnosis of PTSD from a psychiatrist. “I felt like a fraud saying I had [PTSD] without an official diagnosis. I was also open to medication,” she said.Teal’s insurance covered both therapy and psychiatry at zero cost to her. She went to her company’s website and used its wellness login. That way, MDLive had all her information as she signed up.The sign-up process took about 10 minutes, and Teal described it as “very simple.” You also have the option to change your answers in the settings later. The search for a therapist and psychiatrist, in comparison, was relatively difficult.“MDLive has limited filters to find suitable matches compared to other online mental health platforms. The gender filter is readily available, but the specialty filter has limited options … MDLive didn’t provide ‘recommended’ providers based on my questionnaire, which I would’ve found helpful.“From personal experience, therapists specializing in general trauma aren’t as knowledgeable about sexual trauma compared to physical violence or emotional trauma,” Teal said.From her search and available criteria, Teal found 21 therapists who were accredited by her state and only four psychiatrists. Since Teal’s schedule criteria were based on child care, it took about six days to find an appointment that worked for her.The quality of care she received from her psychiatrist was “moderate.” She did receive a PTSD diagnosis rather quickly, “within minutes,” Teal said. “The psychiatrist said I had ‘textbook symptoms.’ I’ve heard stories where it takes people months or even years to receive a diagnosis.”The psychiatrist also prescribed medication and was able to send it to Teal’s chosen pharmacy.The platform of the sessions was also moderate, in Teal’s experience. “There was one session where my psychiatrist was 15 minutes late, so I used the chat box to notify MDLive customer service that my provider hadn’t shown up for the appointment. I never received a chat follow-up.“However, I received an automated phone call saying I had missed the appointment, even though I connected with my psychiatrist once he showed up for the appointment. Thankfully, I didn’t get charged the missed appointment fee. But whether that was due to my chat or my psychiatrist fixing it, I don’t know.”Overall, though, Teal does recommend MDLive.“It can provide beneficial mental health options, and potentially at low or no cost, depending on insurance. However, I think MDLive would best serve someone with short-term issues rather than specific issues that need more long-term [support].“It would also best serve someone who wishes to change their prescriptions or dosages if they take medication for a mental health condition,” Teal said.Content warning: Mentions of childhood sexual abuse, sexual traumaMatilda Teal* used MDLive’s therapy and psychiatry services.

The platform has three options when it comes to price per session:$30 per session: These sessions are run by student interns, who are able to practice any modality. They are therapists in training who are completing their clinical internship under the watch of a supervisor and their professors. The student interns will consult with their supervisors and potentially their professors in a confidential manner.$30 to $70 per session: This price range reflects the pool of licensed and pre-licensed therapists and student interns.$40 to $70 per session: This option will present only licensed and pre-licensed therapists.The other filters allow you to search for a therapist by attributes like race or ethnicity, language, age, and more.Our score breakdownMental Health Professionals5Payment & Insurance3Privacy & Security5Communication2Quality Indicators5.3Pros & consin-person and online therapy availableprovides various search filters to choose a therapiststudent interns may discuss sessions confidentially with their supervisor or professorcannot search by sliding scalein-person and online therapy availableprovides various search filters to choose a therapiststudent interns may discuss sessions confidentially with their supervisor or professorcannot search by sliding scaleProduct detailsServices offered: individual therapy; couples therapy; therapy for kids; teen therapy; group therapy; Therapy formats: in-person or virtualPayment model: pay-by-sessionMedication management: availableFinancial aid: sliding scale varies by provider; for households that make less than $100,000 annuallyPrivacy: HIPAA compliant platformServices offered: individual therapy; couples therapy; therapy for kids; teen therapy; group therapy; Therapy formats: in-person or virtualPayment model: pay-by-sessionMedication management: availableFinancial aid: sliding scale varies by provider; for households that make less than $100,000 annuallyPrivacy: HIPAA compliant platformBest for familiesThriveworksWhy it's best:

Zack liked being able to keep track of feelings throughout the week, not just in sessions, so that he could talk about them when meeting with the therapist. However, both of us were disappointed that some of the required written tasks outside of therapy sessions were not discussed.”The couple noted that they weren’t able to choose their therapist in advance, including not being able to match by gender preference, specialties, and other options. However, they still had a positive experience with the assigned professional.“We were matched with a therapist when we signed up for the service and downloaded the app. We were assigned to them, so we could not choose who the therapist was.Still, our therapist was helpful and adjusted well to our needs. They asked the hard questions and allowed us to dive deep into our thought processes. They gave us actionable takeaways after each session. They let both of us speak and ensured they weren’t talking for us at any point.”Sarah and Zack found scheduling and rearranging Zoom calls simple. “It was easy to schedule and modify sessions within the app. You could do extra 1-on-1 sessions and message outside of the sessions.”Overall, they had a positive experience with Our Ritual. “We would recommend this service. It is a convenient way to engage in therapy, allowing us to think about our relationship in a new light.”Read our full review of Our Ritual.Our testers, Sarah and Zack*, tried Our ritual for 3 weeks and attended two Zoom sessions with their assigned therapist.Zack’s goals were to understand Sarah better, interpret his emotions in the relationship, and learn to communicate effectively. Sarah’s goals were to address any weak points in the relationship and strengthen the relationship overall.The couple praised the app’s features and the structure of Our Ritual’s learning programs and therapy sessions.“You are assigned 1 “course” weekly, with videos to watch and prompts to answer.

Below, we list some honorable mentions that are still worth it, but were missing that one ‘wow’ factor to get it on our Top 6.Therapy for Black Girls | HL Score: 4.4: Therapy for Black Girls is a podcast and therapist directory that gives Black women and girls access to and start conversations about mental health and wellness. You can search by insurance provider, location, in-person or online sessions, group therapy, medication, and by free consultations. It’s a great starting point for Black women, girls, couples, and families who want a therapist who can understand their lifestyle with sensitivity and awareness.Postpartum Support International | HL Score: 4.4: Postpartum Support International is a therapist directory, online support group, and crisis hotline. We didn’t include it on our list since there was information missing from its privacy policy about its encryption process and safeguard for personal health information.Inclusive Therapists | HL Score: 4.1: Inclusive Therapists is another option for underserved identities. It also has search filters for sliding scale, insurance, and more. Because it is a directory and you must contact the therapist outside of its platform, we mentioned Inclusive Therapists as an honorable mention.BetterHelp | HL Score: 3.9: BetterHelp is one of the most well-known and widespread online therapy platforms. Its subscription-based platform is somewhat affordable, but its lack of insurance options and separate platforms for teen and couples counseling had us consider it an honorable mention.A comparison of the best online therapy platformsOnline therapy servicePrice*Insurance accepted?Talkspacestarts at $69 per weekyesBrightside Healthstarts at $95 per monthyesGrow Therapyvaries by therapistyesMDLivestarts at $179 per sessionyesOpen Path Collectivestarts at $30 per sessionnoThriveworksstarts at $65 per sessionyesOur Ritualstarts at $128 per monthno*Price is estimated out-of-pocket cost.
