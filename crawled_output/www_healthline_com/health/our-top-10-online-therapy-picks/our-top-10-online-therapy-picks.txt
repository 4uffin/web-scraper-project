The different methods of communications they offer cater to a number of different people. And the fact that the copay for some folks may be $0 is a pretty big draw.”— Parisa SyedOnline therapy isn’t for emergenciesIf you’re experiencing a mental health crisis, call the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline at 988, or call 911 or local emergency services.

The platform features a user-friendly interface, allowing users to easily search for therapists based on criteria such as state, insurance provider, and specialty.The platform’s unique feature is the option to search for in-person therapy, which is good for those who prefer traditional face-to-face sessions. This feature allows users to select a therapist based on specific criteria and learn about them before the first session.Grow Therapy has rapidly expanded its coverage and services, starting with just 5 states and now serving 47 states and Washington, D.C., with plans for further expansion.The service accepts most major health insurances, so many users can access quality therapy for a copay of $20 or less.

You also have a separate filter option for gender (man, woman, non-binary, gender fluid, or transgender).“Although the L-G-B-T-Q-I-A-+ are not separated, the addition of the gender filter, and treatment methods filter seem sufficient for finding the right provider.”Lee’s expectations were low, as they hadn’t had notable teletherapy experiences in the past. Lee said it was easy to sign up using Google and, “It was pretty easy to find many therapists to choose from, and very easy to join the session (I just clicked the link in my calendar reminder).”Lee added, “The only issue I had was with my sound. Twice I had to leave and rejoin the session because the platform stopped registering my microphone sound.”Lee tester found the platform aesthetic comforting and simplified, so as not to overwhelm.They were able to pay using a combination of insurance and a small copay and they ultimately recommended the platform for affordability and ease of use and matching for folx in the LGBTQIA+ community.Read our full review of Grow Therapy.Our tester Lee* explored the Grow Therapy website and used one session to find therapists “who welcome LGBTQIA+ clients.”Lee added, “You can even filter to see only therapists who are members of the LGBTQIA+ community, if you feel you need to speak with someone with a similar background.

She said the sign-up process was quick and easy. “I felt the survey asked the right questions about my mental health history and current status without getting long-winded.”Once matched with a therapist, she said, they got in touch with her quickly and helped her with discussing a specific situation at hand. “But I will say that I got a lot of automated or copy-and-pasted messages from her that I presumed she may have sent to all of her clients, like when she’d be unavailable.”Christy liked the scheduling freedom, whether someone is in need of weekly sessions or daily messages for a deeper level of support. One caveat is that it can add up quickly, since you pay for services on a weekly basis, she says. “Overall, I liked the flexibility of Talkspace.”Read our full review of Talkspace.Our tester Christy Snyder had limited experience with telehealth before Talkspace.

Users rave about the live sessions, with many saying it’s the reason they chose BetterHelp.About 70% of our survey’s respondents also loved how messaging was an option for BetterHelp, and 44% loved how the platform also has journal prompts to help guide them on their therapy journey.After completing a questionnaire and setting up your account, a computer program will match you with a therapist for your specific needs.

During this time, you won’t be charged or meet with your therapist. You can only pause your subscription once every 3 months.In the past, the company came under fire for allegedly releasing confidential information from its users to third-party advertising platforms like Snapchat, Facebook, and TikTok from 2017 through 2020.In March 2023, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) ordered the service to pay $7.8 million for partial refunds to its customers.

She seemed distracted, though she chimed in and said insightful things when it felt right.”All in all, both Laramy and Parisa recommend BetterHelp as an online therapy platform.Read our full review of BetterHelp.Our tester Laramy Applekamp loved the selection process of finding a therapist. “I appreciated the questionnaire that went into matching me with a therapist (trying to research an in-person therapist felt very overwhelming, so I appreciated the guesswork being taken out of it).” Laramy was matched within 18 hours of submitting her responses.Another tester, Parisa Syed, found the questionnaire “a bit tedious because it was pretty detailed, but it helped match me with a pretty good therapist.” Even though BetterHelp says its matching process takes 24 to 48 hours, Parisa was matched within 2 hours and didn’t switch her initial therapist for the 3 months she used BetterHelp.Laramy loved how easy it was to switch therapists through BetterHelp’s website. “Being able to switch therapists quickly and easily was very convenient and reduced any anxiety that surrounded having to ‘fire’ my first therapist.” Laramy found that the first therapist didn’t click with her on a personal level, but her current therapist is a better fit.Though the therapist suited her needs, Parisa found that there was “an underlying feeling of being rushed … there were times where my therapist definitely was not 100% present.

CBT helps you identify, challenge, and overcome negative or unhelpful thinking patterns and develop behavior modifications that help you think and interact more positively.What makes Online-Therapy.com stand out from other online therapy platforms is its multifaceted approach to counseling. The platform uses a toolbox of resources, including worksheets, an online journal, a 30-minute weekly live chat with your therapist, and messaging to help you find the healing you need.These additional resources are not typical of virtual therapy platforms. They can help people continue their work beyond speaking with a therapist directly.

The purpose of the program is to fill the gap between routine services and emergency room visits. Brightside offers remote care only. Its therapy and medication plans are currently available in all 50 states, except for Crisis Care, which is only available in select states.Coverage and costs vary because Brightside plans can be paid monthly without insurance, except for Crisis Care, which can only be paid for through insurance.

There wasn’t any filtering, and other than their credentials (which aren’t necessarily easy for a layman to make sense of), there was no other information explicitly called out in their profiles.“I didn’t really like how selecting my therapist was based off my schedule rather than [indicating that it was] matching me with therapists that were a good fit with my questionnaire results.”Laramy shared that “being shown all the therapists available on a given day wasn’t very helpful for me — it felt like the burden of picking (and thus the worry about picking wrong) was placed fully with me, and I found myself stressing about which therapist I should select.“Their bios did provide a personal statement, which was somewhat helpful in choosing — but honestly, even with my lower level of anxiety, I was feeling plenty anxious trying to make that choice!”She said the therapist matching was centered on the specific day you’d want a session, and results are sorted accordingly. This didn’t seem so helpful to her.Laramy did find Brightside’s focus on depression and anxiety comforting, though. She also appreciated the “homework” sent via the chat function was helpful if you’re on mobile or the app directly.Overall, she said, “This service seems like good value for someone who’s seeking to put in the work to get targeted anxiety or depression help, and likely even better value for someone who’s also looking for psychiatry to pair with it.“I think it would feel overpriced if you were just looking for more of an emotional outlet with therapy, or a more casual therapeutic experience.”Laramy Applekamp tried Brightside Health for about 3 weeks and attended two sessions with two different therapists plus several of Brightside’s “lessons.”Though Laramy praises a quick sign-up, she notes being matched to a therapist was not tailored enough for her liking.“It was hard for me to easily see whether any of the therapists I could sign up with specialized in different things without clicking into each bio and reading it.

While many people use Regain for couples counseling, the platform is designed to help people in any relationship, including platonic, familial, and romantic relationships. Regain therapists can help you with addressing conflict resolution, setting boundaries, and resolving intimacy or parenting disagreements.Most communication on Regain is done through text, but you can also sign up for video or phone calls with your therapist as well. It’s important to note that three-way calls aren’t an option, so both you and your partner (or family member) will need to be in the same location if you want to use the video or phone feature.Our score breakdownMental Health Professionals1Payment & Insurance3Privacy & Security5Communication5Quality Indicators3What our tester saysOur tester Lea* tried Regain with her husband for online couples therapy.

To her delight, the platform was covered by her insurance and the registration process took less than 10 minutes. “I was immediately matched with psychiatrist options. I’d say I was given about five folks to choose from. I think the therapist matched well with my preferences.”Christy noted it’s easy to get an appointment quickly, with plenty of slots available during the day and evening. She liked that she was able to get 90 days’ worth of medication mailed to her home instead of just 30 days; however, the doctor did not get the dose right. “I had no choice but to pay for it and work with the dose I got (cutting pills in half). The doctor literally quadrupled my prescription, and I presume she misheard me, which is an issue with the virtual calls,” said Christy.Overall, Christy said Doctor on Demand is comparable to other online psychiatry services — possibly even better — and a good fit for those with a busy schedule who need insurance-supported coverage. Should any issues arise, Christy noted the platform has a customer services department where you can submit a support ticket.Our tester Christy Snyder came to Doctor on Demand for an affordable psychiatrist.

It focuses on the needs of Black, Indigenous, and people of color and LGBTQIA2S+ intersections, as well as people who are neurodivergent or disabled. The roster includes psychotherapists, marriage therapists, psychiatrists, social workers, and life coaches, along with community resources about inclusive support groups. Some therapists offer a sliding fee scale, and the network is covered by some insurance providers. However, it didn’t make our final list due to reports of a clunky interface.After filling out a short questionnaire about your needs, you’ll have the option to choose from three recommended professionals. Our tester Nathan Nye found that the platform does not allow you to select multiple filters simultaneously.“For example if I wanted someone who specialized in ADHD therapy consultation, but I wanted the added benefit of them being affirming to the LGBTQ+ community, then I would hope this service would allow that,” he explained.There is a brief message section where you can elaborate on what you’re looking for, but the disclaimer states that it’s not HIPAA compliant. “I would be less inclined to share personal information about myself, such as what treatment I might be looking for,” Nathan said. National Queer and Trans Therapists of Color NetworkNational Queer and Trans Therapists of Color Network is an option worth considering for LGBTQIA+ individuals. It’s an interactive digital resource that connects queer and trans people of color (QTPOC) with QTPOC mental health professionals. The network includes 300 professionals nationwide who offer virtual or in-person counseling.To use this resource, you can search by your state and filter professionals by their services (including telehealth), whether they accept new clients, and whether they offer a sliding scale or low fees.A comparison of the best online therapy platformsOnline therapy platformsPrice Insurance coverageTherapy formatsApp available?
