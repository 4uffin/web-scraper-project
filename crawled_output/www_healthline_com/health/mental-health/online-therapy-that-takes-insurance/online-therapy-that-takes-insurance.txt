Her assigned therapist got in touch with her pretty soon after completing the questionnaire.“It’s great that you can have weekly sessions or daily messaging for when a deeper level of support is needed,” she said. “I liked the flexibility of Talkspace.”Although Christy prefers a more in-person model of talk therapy, she would still recommend the service to people who have lifestyles or personality types that don’t mesh well with in-person therapy.“There are multiple options for communicating with your therapist,” she said.Christy Snyder tried Talkspace to find a mental health professional who could help her talk through some stress and anxiety she was experiencing.She found that the sign-up process was relatively easy and quick.

You can specify preferences, such as therapists specializing in women’s issues or grief counseling, and review detailed profiles to find the right fit. You can then instantly book your session, whether online or in person.Grow Therapy accepts most major insurance providers, making mental health care more accessible and affordable.Read our in-depth review on Grow Therapy.Our score breakdownMental Health Professionals5Payment & Insurance4.5Privacy & Security5Communication4.5Quality Indicators5.5What our tester saysGrow Therapy piqued tester Chelsea Logan’s interest since it accepts insurance.“The fact that I can access therapy for a $20 copay is a huge bonus for me. I also liked that I could read in-depth bios and filter my therapist search according to what I was looking for. I prefer female therapists and wanted to find a therapist who identified as queer. In the past, when I’ve gone to straight therapists, I’ve felt a bit misunderstood,” she said.Our other tester “Lee” agreed that therapists who understood how background informs health were available through Grow Therapy.Chelsea was satisfied with the quality of care but didn’t like a couple of things:“One was the video platform. More than once, I ended up having to use my phone for audio while using my computer for video, since the audio was frequently glitchy. The other was that the service doesn’t bill after each session,” she said.Chelsea guessed that’s because there’s a delay while they bill your insurance, but it made it harder to budget.“Sometimes, I was billed for one session at a time (weeks later), and other times, I was billed for several sessions at once (also weeks later). They do send an email heads-up before they charge you,” she noted.Lastly, Chelsea didn’t love the web experience when vetting each therapist. “I disliked […] having to click into each individual profile to review it — it would have saved me some time to be able to view everything on one page.”Lee agreed. “The only issue I had was with my sound. Twice I had to leave and rejoin the session because the platform stopped registering my microphone sound.”But Lee found the web experience comforting, visually. “The layout is very simple and doesn’t feel overwhelming. The search options are comprehensive and allow visitors to really narrow down their results to the type of therapist/psychiatrist they’re looking for.”He also liked that his metropolitan city living afforded him the opportunity to have in-person sessions with Grow Therapy.But “then I was disappointed that there were none within a reasonable distance for me.”Still, Lee said online therapists are aplenty and “they do give the option to send your therapist a text message through the platform, but I didn’t use that.”Grow Therapy piqued tester Chelsea Logan’s interest since it accepts insurance.“The fact that I can access therapy for a $20 copay is a huge bonus for me.

She was open to this teletherapy service to receive much needed support, a PTSD diagnosis, and medication management if necessary for childhood sexual trauma. Teal had never sought a formal PTSD diagnosis until now.Teal found the experience helpful in next steps but not in treatment. To note, she is pursuing legal action against the person who abused her.“Once the therapist found out I had an active/open investigation, she said it was against company policy to continue providing me therapy. She covered the reasons quickly, but I believe it’s due to MDLIVE’s privacy policy. […] She was helpful in giving recommendations for in-person therapists near me who accept my insurance and walked me through what to expect from my victim advocate.”Though she didn’t receive therapy, MDLIVE did provide psychiatry assistance.“I received a PTSD diagnosis — and rather quickly (within minutes, the psychiatrist said I had ‘textbook symptoms’).  […] The psychiatrist was also able to speak with me about medication and recommended one based on my experiences. He was able to send it digitally to my chosen pharmacy. […] I saved time by not dropping off a prescription.”Tester Matilda Teal said MDLIVE accepted her insurance at no cost to her.

The service treats children, teens, and adults. To be treated by Talkiatry, you must have an active plan with one of its in-network insurance providers.Among the insurance plans that Talkiatry accepts are:AetnaBlueCross Blue ShieldCignaMedicareOptumUnited HealthcareAfter filling out an intake form, you are matched with a clinician based on your preferences.

Talkiatry partners with Healow to provide a patient portal where you can message your psychiatrist and participate in appointments. You also have the option to access your patient portal through a web browser at the Talkiatry sign-in.On the plus side, Sabi found that Talkiatry automatically picked up on their insurance change and made continued coverage easy. “Talkiatry sent an email to me two weeks before the new year that started with ‘Has your insurance information changed?’”* name was changed for privacyTester Sabi* (they/them) signed up with Talkiatry looking for a psychiatrist who could provide deeper, personalized care than they had experienced in the past, along with a checkup on medication for anxiety and depression.Sabi expressed being satisfied with the level of care and convenience, and said they would recommend Talkiatry based on the personalized sessions, easy prescription refills, and user-friendly app.Talkiatry does not have its own app which is something Sabi found confusing since it is not apparent during sign-up. “I think it could be advertised a bit better on their website that they don’t have a specific app.”.

Crisis Care is only available for individuals with insurance.Brightside is a subscription-based online therapy platform that offers a range of mental health services, including therapy, psychiatry, therapy and psychiatry, and crisis care, all covered by insurance.Brightside’s therapy-only plan includes four private video sessions per month and unlimited messaging with licensed therapists.

So if those are your reasons for seeking therapy, it might align well with your goals and experiences.”Laramy added that she met with two therapists in looking for a match, and she was pleased that each “brought a lot of their own personal experience and strategies to our sessions.Brightside has a lot of structured lessons and tools available for their therapists (and their patients), and while my therapists did make those available to me, they both came in with their own modalities and practices, which made me feel like they were a real person, dealing with me as a real person.”She didn’t love that Brightside did seem more expensive than other options and a bit more limited in its offerings than the other mental telehealth platform she’s tried, like BetterHelp.But Laramy said the therapists “seemed to be of fairly high caliber, and the site’s focus on anxiety and depression did make me feel like they had expertise in that area – so fewer ‘frills’ was a valid trade-off.”Tester Sydney Samuels liked Brightside’s accessibility with “both a website and mobile app, and both are intuitive to use and navigate. Brightside also emailed me appointment reminders and a link to my video call, which made it easy to jump on the call at the start of my appointment.”Her goal was to resume medication management and oversight for a previous prescription she tried to wean off of. “I felt ready to try again, and I thought it would be helpful to do so with the guidance of a psychiatrist instead.”Sydney summarized her experience this way:“Brightside was a convenient way for me to get the medication and treatment plan I needed. I found it to be relatively affordable compared to other options, and the platform was simple and straightforward to use. The most negative parts of my experience were related to my specific provider.”She said her psychiatrist rescheduled the first appointment last minute, was late to the next appointment without acknowledging, and forgot to send her treatment plan through the platform’s messaging feature.Sydney didn’t find customer service accessible or helpful with a refund for these appointments but, ultimately, “in the end, I did get the care and treatment plan I needed, though.”Tester Laramy Applekamp really appreciated that not only can you use insurance for this teletherapy platform but also that “they even have an insurance coverage checker.”She said Brightside also offers therapy and psychiatry in the same platform if you need both therapy and prescription care for mental health.Though Laramy said the service’s intake questionnaire didn’t delve too much into demographic needs, it was “very focused on anxiety and depression rather than other reasons people might want or need therapy.
