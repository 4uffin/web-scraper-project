LEARN MORE ABOUT HOW CBD GUMMIES WORKWhat to look for in CBD gummiesConsider the following when buying CBD gummies to make sure you’re getting the best quality and the right product for your needs.
CBD source
The first thing to consider when purchasing CBD gummies is the type of CBD used. There are three types of CBD:
Full-spectrum CBD: This type of CBD retains all the components of the cannabis plant, including a small amount of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, (less than 0.3%) and other cannabinoids like cannabigerol (CBG) and cannabinol (CBN). It also contains terpenes — which contribute aromas and taste — as well as flavonoids, which add antioxidant properties. This range of compounds creates what’s known as the entourage effect.
Broad-spectrum CBD: This type has all the components of the cannabis plant that full-spectrum CBD does but in trace amounts, so it’s not as potent. Broad-spectrum CBD may contain only trace amounts of THC.
CBD isolate: This is pure CBD, with no other compounds from the cannabis plant. However, like broad-spectrum CBD, it may contain trace amounts of THC.
Ingredients
There is a lot more to CBD gummies than just CBD. Other ingredients can vary widely. Pay attention to additives like artificial ingredients and preservatives. Consider CBD gummies made with organic, non-GMO ingredients and real sugar and natural flavorings.
Potency
Doses vary widely across CBD products, and potency may depend on the CBD source. For example, a 5-milligram (mg) full-spectrum CBD gummy may feel a lot more potent than a 5-mg CBD isolate gummy.
When trying CBD gummies for the first time,  start with the lowest dose available — generally 2.5 to 5 mg — and increase from there.

LEARN MORE ABOUT THE BEST CBD GUMMIESHow to take CBD gummiesStart slowly. Most gummies come in packs of 20 to 60, and they’re dosed at 5 mg or more of CBD per gummy. If you’ve never tried CBD, start with a 5-mg gummy. Some gummies can be cut in half, so you can start with 2.5 mg.
Evaluate any effects as you slowly work your way toward finding the right amount for you. Wait up to 2 hours before taking any additional CBD. Then, if you feel like you need more, experiment until you find your “just right” dose.
You can consume gummies daily, but keep in mind that the effects of a gummy tend to last 4 to 6 hours.
