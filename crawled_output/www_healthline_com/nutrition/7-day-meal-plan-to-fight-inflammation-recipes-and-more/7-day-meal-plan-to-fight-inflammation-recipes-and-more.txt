Updated on September 4, 2025Day 1Day 2Day 3Day 4Day 5Day 6Day 7Cooking tipsTakeawayA seven-day meal plan can help you break down your diet and take practical steps to incorporate foods with purported anti-inflammatory properties.Inflammation is an immune response to illness or injury. Normally, it’s protective, drawing more immune cells to the inflamed location so that healing can happen faster; however, long-term inflammation can harm your health. For example, it’s been linked to weight gain, obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, autoimmune diseases, and many other health conditions.Following an anti-inflammatory diet may, therefore, have many health benefits. Always consult with a doctor or healthcare professional before beginning any new diet to be sure it is right for you.»Learn more:What is an Anti-Inflammatory Diet and How to Follow it?Here’s our handy 7-day anti-inflammatory diet meal plan, with recipe links included, to try out this week.Day 1Breakfast: superfood kefir bowls with blueberries and coconutLunch: sweet potato avocado “toast”Dinner: salmon zucchini skewers with cucumber dill sauceSnack: strawberry “granola” snack bowlDay 2Breakfast: overnight oats with cherriesLunch: add shrimp and avocado to a lettuce wrap along with fresh herbs of your choice and lemon juiceDinner: cauliflower pizza bakeSnack: turmeric latte and a handful of nutsDay 3Breakfast: raspberry sherbet chia puddingLunch: coconut basil chicken bowlDinner: quick chicken stir-fry with broccoli and bok choySnack: sliced pears and Gouda cheeseDay 4Breakfast: plum, almond, and yogurt parfaitLunch: Cobb egg SaladDinner: fish tacos with red cabbage slawSnack: matcha latte and nut butter on whole grain toastDay 5Breakfast: acai, cherry, and kale smoothieLunch: whole wheat pasta salad with chicken (substitute fresh spinach for lettuce)Dinner: grilled steak with roasted butternut squash and a side saladSnack: bottled kefir and a pomegranateDay 6Breakfast: egg scramble with everything bagel seasoningLunch: hummus, turkey breast, and veggie sandwich on whole wheat breadDinner: autumn-inspired chicken thighs with apples and root veggiesSnack: hibiscus tea and seed crackers with nut butterDay 7Breakfast: warm fruit salad with almond and chocolateLunch: avocado, tomato, and corn chickpea saladDinner: almond-crusted trout with shaved Brussels sprout saladSnack: lacto-fermented pickles and fresh fruitCooking tipsHere are a few anti-inflammatory cooking tips:Add spices and seasonings. Herbs and spices are great choices for both potential anti-inflammatory properties and flavor, so feel free to liberally season your food with them. Great options include turmeric, ginger, rosemary, cinnamon, oregano, cumin, cayenne pepper, and many others.Cook with garlic and onion. These veggies are rich in antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compounds and are easy to incorporate into many lunch or dinner recipes. Add to marinades, salad dressings, bolognese, stews, stir-fries, and much more.Make your own dressings and marinades. Using combinations of oil, vinegar, herbs, and spices, you can make your own flavorful dressings and marinades that are full of anti-inflammatory compounds.Keep it simple. If cooking complicated recipes with new ingredients each night sounds daunting, keep it simple. Choose a protein source like salmon or chickpeas and combine it with a vegetable and a grain. TakeawayAn anti-inflammatory diet should include fruits and vegetables, healthy protein sources, and healthy fats and oils. You may also want to include coffee or tea, fermented foods, and minimally processed whole grains. Further, it’s a good idea to include a variety of spices and seasonings — not only for their flavor but also because they’re rich in anti-inflammatory compounds.On the other hand, try to avoid highly processed foods, added sugars, and refined seed oils like soybean and corn oil.This 7-day meal plan can provide some meal and snack ideas and serve as a good starting point for your anti-inflammatory diet.
