I really enjoyed the flavors and textures of each dish I tried.”“I found the ordering process straightforward, and all the ingredients arrived in good condition and tasted fresh.”Our tester’s favorite Purple Carrot meals included:New England Lobster Rolls: “A creative twist on a classic dish [that] used heart of palm in place of lobster. While it doesn’t replace a “true“ lobster roll, I was surprised at how closely it replicated the taste and texture.”Romesco Grain Bowls: “Included pan-roasted mushrooms and butter beans. Again, I found the dish brimming with flavor and appreciated the variation in textures.”Spicy Almond Butter Noodles: “I LOVED the sauce, and the texture of the whole wheat ramen was awesome. I also liked the bok choy, as I don’t buy it often. My only complaint was that the textures felt a bit repetitive after a while, and I wished that there was tofu for an extra protein boost.“One criticism from McGrane is that “the meals took quite a bit longer to make than recipes from other meal delivery services I’ve tried.”However, McGrane notes that “Purple Carrot’s recipes were the most unique. I loved that the service introduced me to new ingredients and flavor combinations.““Purple Carrot is a safe bet if you’re looking for flavorful, fully plant-based meals.“Photos by Kelli McGrane, RS, MD.Our tester, Registered Dietician Kelli McGrane, reviewed Purple Carrot for Healthline.“Purple Carrot was a hit with my whole family thanks to its creative ingredients and flavor combinations.

She was keen to try Daily Harvest because it prioritized quality ingredients.“I’m willing to pay a bit more for fresh, organic ingredients, and I feel like that’s what I got with these meals. They tasted fresh, and the fruits and veggies had good flavor.”She notes that “selecting my meals was a breeze.” With the delivery, Arntson was impressed by the speed and packaging: “I was a little nervous that the meals were going to arrive defrosted, but the box included a couple of packages of dry ice, which helped the meals stay frozen, even in a heatwave.”Our tester’s favorite meals included:Shitake + Spinach Grits: “This is, hands down, my favorite dish that I ordered from Daily Harvest. I would order this again and again. I did not expect the grits to be as creamy and thick as they were. The dish was very savory, with an umami-like blend of spices and an overall warm flavor. This was the perfect midweek lunch for me. It was filling without making me feel stuffed.”Purple Corn and Tomatillo Soup: “The taste was spot-on. I love a flavor kick, and the tomatillo provided some nice heat without being too hot. Both the purple corn and chickpeas had a nice snap, while the avocado pieces were soft. This wasn’t as filling as the grits, but it would make for a really nice lunch along with a salad.”Mint + Cacao Smoothie: “This smoothie is one of Daily Harvest’s best sellers, and I can understand why. It really does taste like a healthier version of mint chocolate chip ice cream. It was flavorful and still tasted fresh. You could tell there were no added preservatives or other ingredients, and I appreciated [that it is high in] fiber.”Arntson also tried the pops, which she states “were a great cooling treat. They have a bold, tangy flavor, and they’re pretty refreshing. Another Daily Harvest standout for me.”One product that our tester wasn’t a fan of was the Bell Pepper + Cilantro Flatbread, which “wasn’t very filling and I was still hungry after.”Overall, Arntson “really liked that Daily Harvest’s meals are frozen. They’re ready to go when I want them, and I don’t have to worry about produce going bad in the fridge. […] It was just blend and eat, or heat and eat.” However, she notes, “while Daily Harvest isn’t necessarily a meal kit, I did have to use some kitchen equipment to create the meals, though it was super minimal.”Photos by Anne Arntson.Our tester, Anne Arntson, has been mainly eating plant-based since childhood.

She chose Sprinly because “I’ve been trying to incorporate more whole plant foods into my diet, and it isn’t always easy. A meal delivery service like this takes away decision fatigue, finding ingredients, and cooking.”Elmer found that “getting started was really simple. You could see the full meal options for several weeks out beforehand, and then you could quickly sign up.” However, “there are only 6 meals offered each week, so if you don’t like what there is, you have to skip that week. Still, there is a good variety of ingredients and flavors.”Our tester’s favorite meals included:Paprika Spinach Salad with Baked Tofu & Hemp Hearts: “I’d never had hemp hearts before, so this was a novelty that I ended up really liking! The tofu was also really good. Whatever they cooked it in was delicious. It also stood up well to sitting in the fridge for a couple of days. “Roasted Tahini “Butter” Sweet Potatoes with Red Rice and Sweet Lemon Kale: “This meal was really good, with good texture. The sauce was very nice and light. It did need a little salt, though.”Osaka Soba Noodles with Tofu and Peanut Sauce: “It was good overall. I added extra almonds. Otherwise, the sauce was really tasty, and the tofu was a good texture.”One meal our tester had mixed feelings about was the Pesto Pasta with Sun-dried Tomato Cakes, stating that “the Sun-dried Tomato Cakes, even covered in pesto, were still fairly dry. They were pretty dense.”Elmer also criticized some of the portion ratios and noted that she added seasoning and toppings to some meals to provide more flavor.Our tester appreciated that the meal packaging contains all nutritional and ingredient information. “Many meal kits I’ve seen have very bare packaging, which means to check ingredients or nutritional information, you’re stuck going back to the website to check.“Overall, Elmer suggests “if you’re eating a plant-based diet and have a flexible palate, Sprinly could be the right meal service for you.“Photos by Jamie Elmer.Our tester, Jamie Elmer, has tried many different meal delivery services.

She notes that “everything arrived when it said it would, the packaging was intact, and the meals were good to go!”“Almost all of the plant-based meals were some combination of rice, a protein (tofu, Impossible crumble, plant-based “chicken,” or beans), a vegetable, and a sauce. Trifecta could have offered more distinct options  by offering different bases (pasta, quinoa, cauliflower rice, etc.) or varying up the vegetables more, but plenty of the meals sounded good to me.”Our tester notes that the portion sizes were ideal; “Some of the services I’ve tried before had smaller portions that left me unsatisfied. Trifecta, however, had the perfect portion sizes for me. I was never hungry after a meal, and I wasn’t overly stuffed, either.”However, Samuels was disappointed by the texture and flavor of some of the meals: ” The veggies were often mushy, and the tofu could be dry. Some of the sauces were a bit watery, and some meals had too much sauce. Several of the meals had great flavor, but a few of them were bland.”Our tester made special note of the delivery and sustainable packaging; “The packaging [was] recyclable and sustainable. The cooling “ice packs,” called Enviro Ice, could be refrozen and reused as ice packs, or the contents could be drained and used as plant food.” However, “each meal came in a single-use plastic container with a plastic film.”While Samuels criticized the cost of meals in comparison to other meal services, she suggests it is worth the price if you want “organic, ethically sourced ingredients and macro-balanced meals — especially given the convenience of fully prepared meals.”Photos by Sydney Samuels.Our tester, Sydney Samuels, found the ordering process for Trifecta Nutrition simple.

It’s noted for its high quality ingredients, many of which are pre-chopped, making meal assembly a breeze.Plus, with an option for 6 servings, it’s also one of the best meal kits for larger households.It consistently ranks as our reviewers’ favorite meal kit services for its innovative dishes, fresh ingredients, and large selection of options to choose from.While Green Chef is one of our highest scoring meal services, we did not choose it as the best overall for this list, because it is not fully plant-based.

The fritters themselves were crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The rice had a great tang, and the mayo-based sauce had just the right amount of heat. I will say that the dish was a tad more difficult to make than the others, as it took me one or two fritters to get the hang of making them.”Butternut and Porcini Linguine: “This dish came together easily and quickly. I loved all of the vegetables and varying textures in the dish. However, I would’ve liked a bigger “pow” of flavor.”However, McGrane found that the recipes were not always accurate and required more equipment than she was used to: “My main complaints with Green Chef were that the timing of some of the instructions was a bit off and that most of the recipes required several pots and pans, which made for a longer cleanup time.”Overall, our tester praised Green Chef’s vegan meals: “I appreciated that [Green Chef] offers a dedicated vegan menu for plant-based eaters and that the vegan options are just as thoughtfully crafted as the meat-containing meals. The meals were bursting with various textures and ingredients. The flavors were tasty and different from what we typically cook at home.”Our tester, registered dietitian Kelli McGrane, praised Green Chef’s vegetable content and flavor profile: “The meals I tried were brimming with multiple types of vegetables, and the dishes were flavorful without being overly salty or spicy.”Our tester’s favorite meals included:Japanese Cabbage and Carrot Fritters: “My whole family loved this recipe, as it’s different than what we usually make and was packed with flavor. The fritters themselves were crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The rice had a great tang, and the mayo-based sauce had just the right amount of heat. I will say that the dish was a tad more difficult to make than the others, as it took me one or two fritters to get the hang of making them.”Butternut and Porcini Linguine: “This dish came together easily and quickly. I loved all of the vegetables and varying textures in the dish. However, I would’ve liked a bigger “pow” of flavor.”However, McGrane found that the recipes were not always accurate and required more equipment than she was used to: “My main complaints with Green Chef were that the timing of some of the instructions was a bit off and that most of the recipes required several pots and pans, which made for a longer cleanup time.”Overall, our tester praised Green Chef’s vegan meals: “I appreciated that [Green Chef] offers a dedicated vegan menu for plant-based eaters and that the vegan options are just as thoughtfully crafted as the meat-containing meals. The meals were bursting with various textures and ingredients.

I noticed that Splendid Spoon labeled everything clearly on their site and offered several dishes I could actually eat. When you click on the nutrition facts and ingredients, it clearly lists if it contains common allergens, which was very helpful for me.”Her ordering experience was challenging: “I had lots of technical issues ordering on their site, and I reached out to their customer service. Eventually, I could place an order, but it was extremely difficult.”However, “it arrived very quickly and was packaged in dry ice. Because it was so cold, I had to use gloves to unbox everything. There was a warning on the box about this. Everything was so frozen solid that I had to wait a day to start trying anything. So know you won’t be able to enjoy anything immediately when it arrives.”Our tester’s favorite products included:Kale & Lentil Soup: “It was really good! There was more kale than I thought there would be, but this was delicious. I also liked that there were both red and green lentils in it. It microwaved fine, and I would eat it again. It was probably my favorite thing in the whole box.”Blue Majik Smoothie: “My favorite of the three smoothies because it was thicker and had a little bit more protein. The flavor was gentle and satisfying.”Split pea soup: “I usually think of split pea soup as being mostly pureed, but this had whole peas. It smelled delicious when heating, but it took more cooking than just heating up. Mint was barely there, gentle, which was good. Same with tarragon. I enjoyed it overall but was expecting more of a puree.”Our tester did note that some meals were improved with seasoning or additional ingredients.While Farr enjoyed the flavor of the smoothies, she found them too watery and overpriced for the quality. With the health shots, the flavor of most was too potent, though the Immunity Shot and Detox Shot were her favorites.Overall, Farr appreciated that “everything Splendid Spoon does is plant-based, non-GMO, gluten-free, and free from artificial sweeteners. All things that make me feel good about eating their food.”“If you’re constantly on the go, then I imagine this service could be a great way to eat healthier for around the same price as ordering out.“Our tester, Naomi Farr, was keen to try Splendid Spoon because it was suitable for her dietary needs:“There are many foods and ingredients I have to avoid because of allergies or intolerances.

They offer various options, including large family-sized meals.Mosaic is a great choice if you want a vegan meal service that provides large enough portions to feed the whole family.Every family meal contains at least four types of vegetables and is free from artificial additives and added sweeteners. Mosaic also offers single-portion meals, including breakfast, lunch, and dinner. All these meals contain several types of vegetables and provide 10 to 20+ grams of protein per serving.Another good option for family-friendly meal delivery is Green Chef.*Note: Our score for Mosaic Foods is based only on its family-size meals.Read our full review of Mosaic Foods here.Our score breakdownSign-up, delivery, and cancellation processes4Meal variety2Nutrition5Sustainability4.5Ingredient quality3.5Ease of preparation4.5Taste3.5Affordability3.5What our tester saysPhotos by tester Kelli McGrane, MS, RD.Our tester, Kelli McGrane, MS, RD, tried four family meals from Mosaic.“As a dietitian, I appreciated that each meal contained at least four types of vegetables. As a mom, I loved having a stash of ready-to-cook meals in the freezer for nights when I didn’t feel like cooking.”“My meals arrived on time and in good condition. While they aren’t large boxes, depending on how many you order, they can take up a decent amount of freezer space.”Standout meals for our tester included the Penne alla Vodka, which was her favorite for the flavor, and the Veggie Pot Pie, which she says cooked well and had “a surprisingly flaky pastry.” McGrane was “overall impressed by the number and serving size of vegetables in each dish. I also liked the variety of plant-based protein options on the menu. The texture of the grains and noodles was great.”However, she found “most of the vegetables to be soft, with some, especially the green beans, tasting a bit watery. I found the tofu to have an almost spongy-like consistency. A few meals did need a little flavor boost from additional sauces or seasoning.”Another downside was that “most family-size meals suggest oven cooking 60 to 75 minutes, but all of the ones I tried took closer to 90 minutes.”Our tester did praise Mosaic’s commitment to sustainability. She added, “I also think it’s noteworthy how they creatively weave many vegetables into each meal.”McGrane suggests that Mosaic is a “great option for families that want a stash of healthy meals in the freezer. It would also make for a great housewarming or new parents gift.”Photos by tester Kelli McGrane, MS, RD.Our tester, Kelli McGrane, MS, RD, tried four family meals from Mosaic.“As a dietitian, I appreciated that each meal contained at least four types of vegetables.

However, whether and how often animal products are consumed varies from person to person.Vegan: A vegan diet avoids all animal products. Veganism is also a lifestyle often associated with and rooted in animal rights. According to the Vegan Society, veganism “excludes … all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing, or any other purpose.” This means steering clear of any animal byproduct like leather, wool, silk, or suede in addition to animal flesh.Vegetarian: A vegetarian diet doesn’t include any meat, poultry, game, fish, shellfish, or byproducts of animal slaughter, but it can include eggs and dairy. However, other types of vegetarian diets may also avoid eggs, dairy, and other animal byproducts.Other vegan-friendly services we consideredHere are a few other services we tested and considered for this review, but that didn’t quite make the cut.Sunbasket (4.6 out of 5): Our testers enjoyed Sunbasket’s meals, but it might be a better option for people who aren’t strictly plant-based. It offers only a few vegetarian options each week, and it doesn’t have a dedicated vegan menu. Read our in-depth Sunbasket review here.Hello Fresh (4.2 out of 5): Hello Fresh is an affordable meal delivery service that offers a few vegetarian and vegan menu items each week. Like some other services on our list, it also offers menus that contain animal products. It is transparent about its suppliers for those products, but as shown in a recent chicken welfare report, it has a longer way to go on its key goals.
