Updated on September 15, 2025You can get more fiber by eating certain fruits, starchy vegetables, legumes, and whole grains. There are many strategies to incorporate into your diet, and you can also take fiber supplements if needed.Share on PinterestPixel Stories/Stocksy UnitedFiber is a type of carb found in plant-based foods. Getting enough fiber in your diet can help support and maintain weight loss. Further, some types of fiber are prebiotic — meaning they promote healthy gut bacteria — and may be beneficial for digestive health.It can also help reduce the risk of:constipationtype 2 diabetesheart diseaseYet most people aren’t eating enough fiber. Most adults in North America consume only 17 grams (g) per day. If you’re looking to add more, here are 16 ways you can add more fiber to your diet.1. Eat whole food carb sourcesWhile most carbs break down into sugar, fiber stays intact as it passes through your digestive system. This helps you feel fuller for longer when eating fiber along with other carbs.It also slows the time it takes for digestible carbs to be absorbed into your bloodstream, helping to regulate your blood sugar levels.Whole food carb sources all naturally contain fiber. These include: fruitsstarchy vegetableslegumeswhole grainsnutsseeds2. Include veggies in meals, and eat them firstEating vegetables before other components of a meal may reduce your blood sugar and insulin levels after eating. This study found that the effect was observed regardless of how fast or slow the meal was eaten, so long as the vegetables were eaten first and the carbohydrates were eaten last.3. Eat popcornPopcorn is a whole grain, delivering 4 grams of fiber per ounce (28 grams). One ounce is 3 cups of air-popped popcorn.For the lowest calorie popcorn, air pop it either in a brown paper bag in the microwave or in an air popper. 4. Snack on fruitAll fruit delivers fiber, although some have significantly more than others. For instance, one small pear has almost 5 grams of fiber. A cup of raspberries has 8 grams of fiber, and apples are another high fiber fruit.The fiber from fruit can improve fullness, especially when paired with food that contains fat and protein, such as nut butter or cheese. They are also portable and easy to snack on.5. Choose whole grains over refined grainsWhole grains are minimally processed, leaving the whole grain intact. In contrast, refined grains have been stripped of their vitamin-containing germ and fiber-rich bran. This makes the grain last longer but also takes away the most nutritious parts, leaving only a fast-absorbing carb.Try replacing at least half of the refined grains in your diet with whole grain versions, such as:amaranthbarleybuckwheatbulgur wheatfarrofreekehmilletquinoawheat berries6. Take a fiber supplementIt’s best to get your nutrition — including fiber — from food. But if your fiber intake is low, you might consider taking a supplement.A few types of supplements have research to back them up:Guar fiber: As a supplement, guar fiber may reduce constipation and symptoms of IBS.Psyllium: This is the key ingredient in Metamucil, a popular fiber supplement used for constipation. In one study, psyllium was also shown to decrease blood pressure in hypertensive individuals.Glucomannan: This fiber is added to some low fat dairy products to improve texture, and it’s the main ingredient in no-calorie shirataki noodles. As a supplement, it may help reduce weight in individuals with overweight or obesity.β-glucans: This type of fiber is found in oats and barley. It’s fermented in the gut and acts as a prebiotic to support the healthy microorganisms that live there.However, supplements have two main drawbacks. First, they can cause stomach discomfort and bloating. To reduce this, introduce a fiber supplement gradually and drink plenty of water.Second, these supplements can interfere with the absorption of certain medications. So, if you’re currently taking any medications, speak to a healthcare professional before taking a fiber supplement.7. Eat chia seedsChia seeds provide omega-3 fatty acids, protein, vitamins, and minerals. They also contain approximately 30 to 34 gof dietary fiber, of which the insoluble fraction accounts for approximately 85% to 93%.Flax seeds are another high fiber choice, providing 2 grams per half ounce.Recipes with chia seedsWarm Pears with Chia Walnut CrumbleCinnamon Oatmeal with Fresh Fruit, Almonds and Chia SeedsRaspberry Sherbet Chia PuddingBlueberry Chia PuddingBanana Chia Overnight Oatmeal8. Eat whole fruits and vegetables, not juiceJuices have been stripped of fiber. They may also contain high amounts of added sugar.Though you can enjoy drinking 100% fruit and vegetable juices in moderation, eating the whole fruit allows you to reap the most benefits.9. Eat avocadosHalf an avocado delivers 5 grams of fiber.Avocados have been linked to a lower risk of metabolic syndrome, a condition that increases your chances of developing conditions such as:heart diseasestroketype 2 diabetesRecipes with avocadoBacon Avocado Cottage Cheese BowlSpiced Tuna Steak with Red Pepper Avocado SalsaEgg and Avocado Breakfast SandwichBlack Bean and Avocado Salad WrapShrimp Salad with Quinoa, Corn, and Avocado10. Snack on nuts and seeds, or add them to recipesNuts and seeds are versatile foods. They’re shelf-stable and nutrient-dense, making them ideal snacks to have on hand. You can also use them in recipes to add extra nutrition and fiber to your meals.An ounce of almonds has close to 4 grams of fiber. They’re also high in unsaturated fats, magnesium, and vitamin E.11. Bake with high-fiber floursYou can easily replace white flour with whole wheat pastry flour. This fine-textured flour has more than 5 times as much fiber as white flour.Some alternative flours are even richer in fiber.For example, an ounce of coconut flour has 10 grams of fiber, while the same amount of soy flour has 7 grams.Several other non-wheat flours have about 3 grams of fiber per ounce: the same as whole wheat flour. These include:almondchickpeabuckwheat12. Eat berriesBerries with seeds are among the most fiber-rich fruits.For the most fiber, choose raspberries or blackberries at 8 grams per cup. Other good choices are strawberries (3 grams) and blueberries (4 grams).Add berries to cereal and salads, or pair them with yogurt for a healthy snack. Frozen and fresh berries are equally healthy.13. Include plenty of legumes in your dietLegumes — that is, beans, dried peas, and lentils — are rich in fiber, as well as protein, carbs, vitamins, and minerals. In fact, a cup of cooked beans can deliver up to about 50% of your daily fiber needs.There are several ways to increase legume consumption:Use hummus and other bean dips.Add mashed or whole beans to ground beef dishes.Top salads with cooked beans or lentils.14. Leave the peel or skin onWhen you peel fruits and vegetables, you often remove half the fiber. For instance, one small apple has 3.5 grams of fiber, but a peeled apple has less than 2 grams.Similarly, a small potato has 3 grams of fiber, one of which is from the skin.15. Read labels to choose foods with lots of fiberSome foods — including yogurt, granola bars, cereals, and soups — may contain functional fibers. These are extracted from natural sources and then added to foods as a supplement.Common names you can look for on food labels are inulin and polydextrose.You can read the nutrition label to see how many grams of fiber are in a serving. 16. Eat high fiber foods at every mealSpread your fiber intake throughout the day. Focus on eating high fiber foods at each meal, including snacks.Example of a high fiber, full day of eatingBreakfast: Choose a high fiber cereal or oatmeal, and add berries and seeds.Snack: Pair raw vegetables with bean dip, or raw fruit with nut butter.Lunch: Have a salad. If you make a sandwich, choose 100% whole grain bread.Dinner: Add beans and other vegetables to casseroles and stews. Try a variety of cooked whole grains.The takeawayFiber is immensely important for your health.By adopting some of these strategies, you can increase your fiber intake to optimal amounts. How we reviewed this article:SourcesHistoryHealthline has strict sourcing guidelines and relies on peer-reviewed studies, academic research institutions, and medical journals and associations.
