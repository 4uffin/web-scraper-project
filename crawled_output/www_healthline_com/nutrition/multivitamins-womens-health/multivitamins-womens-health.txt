(Note: Sex and gender exist on spectrums. This article uses “women” to refer to a person’s sex assigned at birth.)Hot take“When it comes to supplements, the price is not always a good reflection of the quality,” says Kelli McGrane, MS, RD.“There are plenty of expensive multivitamins that aren’t third-party tested for purity and potency or that contain types or amounts of nutrients that simply aren’t necessary for everyone. On the flip side, brands like Nature Made are more affordable, yet have extensive quality control measures and offer comprehensive formulations.”After re-evaluating our picks in May 2025, with the help of Kelli, we bumped our budget-friendly pick — Nature Made Multi For Her — to our top pick. It may not be the flashiest brand, but it’s a very accessible price point and still includes an impressive mix of nutrients that are beneficial for women.It does have a few shortcomings to consider. We cover those below, along with our other picks, and advice from a dietitian on the various nutrient forms. We recommend these women’s multivitamins if you don’t have any specific nutrient or life stage concerns and are simply looking for a quality multivitamin with general coverage.Disclaimer: Some of the products tested below were provided for free to Healthline editors or writers.

That means you can trust that the contents match the label.Each 1 capsule-sized serving provides more than 100% of the daily value (DV) for vitamin D, B6, and folate. It also includes all 8 B vitamins (key for energy and metabolism).It also contains 100% of the DV for iron in the highly absorbable form ferrous fumarate, making this a great option for women who are menstruating.Versus other contenders: It also provides a good amount of calcium to support bone health as well as 25% of the DV for magnesium — an essential mineral that many people don’t get enough of.Some nutrients are present in amounts lower than 100% of the DV, which may be a deal-breaker for some (though, it could be a pro for others). Remember, that multivitamins are meant to support your diet, and you should still be eating a mix of foods that provide key nutrients.Downsides: Some of the nutrients, like magnesium, are present in forms the body doesn’t absorb as well. “However, this shouldn’t be a cause of concern unless you have a nutrient deficiency,” says Kelli. For most women, this multivitamin would still provide enough nutrient support.Keep in mind that while ferrous fumarate is well absorbed by the body, it’s more likely to cause gastrointestinal (GI) side effects, such as constipation, than another form of iron called iron bisglycinate.Additionally, if you prefer an organic multivitamin, our former top pick by Garden of Life may be a better option.Our score breakdownTester Review5Expert Review4What our tester saysPhotos by Kelle WalshKelle Walsh shared that she regularly takes women’s multivitamins and was curious to try this product because of its lower price point.After taking it for 2 weeks, Walsh noted, “I only take one-a-day multis, so this experience was the same. The [Nature Made] pill was slightly smaller.”She shared that the tablet was easy to take, didn’t have an unpleasant taste or aftertaste, and didn’t cause any unwanted side effects.When asked about her overall thoughts about the value of the product, Walsh answered, “It’s definitely a good value. It costs half as much as my usual multivitamin.”Photos by Kelle WalshKelle Walsh shared that she regularly takes women’s multivitamins and was curious to try this product because of its lower price point.After taking it for 2 weeks, Walsh noted, “I only take one-a-day multis, so this experience was the same.

$$ = $0.50 to $1.50 per servingUse code "HEALTHLINE" for 25% Off!SHOP NOW AT RITUAL4.8out of 5healthline scoreHealthline’s reviewWhy we chose it: This multivitamin provides nutrients that many women in their 20s and 30s often don’t get enough of, including vitamin D, folate, and omega-3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).Versus other contenders: Unlike our other picks, it only contains 2 out of 8 B vitamins. Most of the multivitamins on our list are designed to support nutrient gaps and balanced diets, and this one is the most minimalist.It’s a good option for people who could use help getting key nutrients like vitamin D, folate, B12, iron, and magnesium. It’s best if you don’t need all the extra micronutrients.It also stands out for containing omegas, but it only contains DHA. According to Kelli, the body needs both DHA and EPA to function at its best. (For consideration: Our Perelel pick below contains both if you don’t eat a lot of seafood to make up for this.)Omega-3 DHA is associated with eye, heart, and brain health. While it’s typically found in fish, Ritual sources it from microalgae, which means it’s vegan-friendly.Downsides: This product is geared toward women who already eat a mostly healthy diet and need help filling a few nutrient gaps.Notably, the product is missing vitamin C, 6 out of 8 B vitamins, selenium, and calcium. Again, this could a positive for some people who get these through food.Learn more about Ritual in our comprehensive review.Our score breakdownTester Review4.5Expert Review5What our tester saysPhoto courtesy of Kelli McGraneKelli had a positive experience with these multivitamins overall. “I found the pills easy to swallow and appreciated the company’s transparency around ingredient sourcing,” she said.Again, since she doesn’t eat fish very frequently, she cited the inclusion of omega-3 DHA as a plus for her.Something unique about Ritual is that the brand includes food-grade plastic tablets infused with peppermint, lemon, or vanilla essential oils in each bottle. These are meant to help mask the smell of potentially off-putting ingredients like omega-3 DHA, which can smell fishy.“While some online reviewers complain about fishy burps, I found that the minty-fresh flavor masked any fishiness,” Kelli said.Photo courtesy of Kelli McGraneKelli had a positive experience with these multivitamins overall. “I found the pills easy to swallow and appreciated the company’s transparency around ingredient sourcing,” she said.Again, since she doesn’t eat fish very frequently, she cited the inclusion of omega-3 DHA as a plus for her.Something unique about Ritual is that the brand includes food-grade plastic tablets infused with peppermint, lemon, or vanilla essential oils in each bottle.

However, if you plan on taking a multivitamin in addition to omega-3s and collagen, it’s a good value for supplements that are third-party tested for purity and potency and made with highly absorbable forms.The multivitamin is comprehensive with over 100% of the DV for vitamin D, folate, and vitamin B6. It also includes all 8 B vitamins and a small amount of magnesium.Perelel’s supplements are third-party tested for purity and potency, though the name of the testing organization isn’t disclosed.You can save 15% if you opt for recurring monthly shipments.Versus other contenders: This women’s multivitamin includes an omega-3 supplement in the same pack that’s provides 350 mg of combined DHA and EPA to support brain and heart health. This is in line with what many health organizations recommend.It also comes with a beauty blend capsule that includes biotin and hydrolyzed collagen. Collagen is the most abundant protein in your body and plays a key role in maintaining the health of your skin, muscles, and bones.While more research is needed, collagen supplements have been linked with benefits for skin health (including reducing wrinkles) and for strengthening hair and nails. Other research demonstrates it has benefits for hydration and elasticity.Downsides: Unlike most other picks on our list that require 1-2 pills per day, this one requires taking 3 capsules per day.It also does not contain iron, which could be a positive for some. It’s not suitable for vegans (only Ritual and Mindbodygreen on our list are vegan).Learn more about Perelel and our experience trying it in our full review.Our score breakdownTester Review4Expert Review4What our tester saysPhotos by Kelli McGraneKelli was familiar with Perelel after taking the company’s trimester-specific prentatal vitamins during her second pregnancy.According to Kelli, “I’m not a big fish eater, so I typically take a fish oil supplement from Nordic Naturals. I’ve also been struggling with my nails breaking easily ever since I stopped taking prenatal vitamins.“So, when I saw that Perelel’s Women’s Daily Trio combines a general women’s multivitamin with an omega-3 supplement and a beauty blend, I was curious to see if it might be a more convenient (and possibly more affordable) alternative to my current supplement regimen.”While two of the three pills are on the larger size, Kelli reported that she didn’t have any difficulty swallowing them.That said, she did have one helpful tip: “Because the capsules have a slightly unpleasant taste that’s only noticeable if you let them sit on your tongue for more than a few seconds, I recommend having your water glass ready to go before popping the pills in your mouth.”At the time of her review, Kelli had only been taking the daily pack for a little over a week. However, she mentioned that she’s already noticed that her nails feel stronger and aren’t breaking as easily.Photos by Kelli McGraneKelli was familiar with Perelel after taking the company’s trimester-specific prentatal vitamins during her second pregnancy.According to Kelli, “I’m not a big fish eater, so I typically take a fish oil supplement from Nordic Naturals.

Each 2-capsule serving contains 9 milligrams (mg) of iron, which is 50% of the daily value (DV) for premenopausal women.What’s more, the form of iron used is thought to be easier on the stomach and potentially more effective for improving hemoglobin levels, though more research is needed.Providing 27 key vitamins and minerals, mindbodygreen’s ultimate multivitamin+ is also the most comprehensive multivitamins on our list.Mindbodygreen supplements undergo rigorous testing throughout the manufacturing process at International Organization for Standardization (ISO) certified third-party labs to ensure purity and potency.The company’s ultimate multivitamin+ is also vegan-friendly, gluten-free, and soy-free, making it suitable for people with certain dietary restrictions.Versus other contenders: This supplement stands out in that most nutrients are present in amounts at or exceeding 100% of the DV (which again, isn’t necessary for everyone).In addition to vitamin D, folate, all 8 B vitamins and a handful of essential minerals, the product provides a good source of calcium and magnesium — both of which are important for women’s health.While the nutrient amounts present aren’t necessary or appropriate for everyone, the formulation is worth considering for those who follow more limited or restrictive diets.Downsides: The biggest downside of this multivitamin is the price. It’s really only necessary if you eat a limited diet. However, you can save $11 per bottle when you sign up for a monthly subscription.Learn more about the brand in our full mindbodygreen review. Our score breakdownTester Review5Expert Review4What our tester saysPhoto courtesy of tester Megan SeversMegan Severs tested these multivitamins for 1 month. Although in the past she’s had trouble remembering to take multivitamins daily, she said these were easy to remember. That’s because the bottle was so nice-looking that she didn’t mind leaving it on her counter.As for the pills themselves, she commented that she didn’t mind taking the daily dose of 2 pills per day.“Each pill was easy to swallow, and they didn’t have a noticeable taste or aftertaste.“The pills were gentle on the stomach. I don’t always eat breakfast, and even when I took them without food, I did not experience any nausea, which is not the case with other multivitamins I have taken. In fact, I had no noticeable side effects.”The only drawback in her mind is the cost.“They are about twice as expensive as the multivitamins I usually take, but I was happy enough with the experience and lack of side effects that I’d consider switching to these, despite the increased expense,” she said.Photo courtesy of tester Megan SeversMegan Severs tested these multivitamins for 1 month.

$$ = $0.50 to $1.50 per servingSHOP NOW AT IHERBHealthline's reviewWhy we chose it: Unlike the other multivitamins on our list, this one contains only nutrients from whole food sources. It contains 125% DV of vitamin D and all eight B vitamins. Almost all the nutrients are present over 100% DV, making it a fairly comprehensive option.The product is also certified vegan, making it suitable for omnivores and vegans. It’s also certified gluten-free.Like other on our list, all Garden of Life products are third-party tested for purity and potency. But the company also claims to test all products in house to make sure they’re free of heavy metals, microbial growth, and pathogenic species.Vs other contenders: It’s the only women’s multivitamin on our list made with whole food ingredients. It’s formulated with an organic food blend made up of organic apple, strawberry, bell pepper, ginger, and many more.It’s important to read the nutrition label to make sure you don’t have any sensitivities to the food sources.Downsides: It’s low in iron (but this may be a positive for some people who no longer menstruate). Iron can also cause constipation, so if you find yourself in this way, you may appreciate less iron in your supplements.It’s also the only option on our list that lack magnesium, which can support sleep, stress, and PMS symptoms.What our tester saysPhotos courtesy of Kelli McGrane, MS, RDKelli took this multivitamin for 1 month and said she was overall impressed. She appreciated that the daily dosage is just one tablet per day rather than two or more like some other products.But she did caution that the tablets are on the larger side, so they might not be the best fit for those who have difficulty swallowing pills. Interestingly, she noted that although the tablets are technically unflavored, they do have a slightly herbal or fruity smell and taste, likely because of the whole foods blend.She didn’t experience huge changes or side effects, but did notice some gradual, small changes.“I eat a generally healthy diet, so I didn’t expect to notice changes to my mood or general well-being. However, after just a few weeks, my nails felt stronger and didn’t break as frequently as they typically do.”Photos courtesy of Kelli McGrane, MS, RDKelli took this multivitamin for 1 month and said she was overall impressed.

We like that it’s affordable at a lower price point and contains real food ingredients and nutrient forms the body can absorb well. However, it’s not as rigorously tested. We’re reaching out for more information and testing it to consider against current picks. Garden of Life mykind Organics Women’s Once Daily Tablets: If you want an organic multivitamin, this is a good option. It’s also third-party tested for purity and potency, certified NSF gluten-free, Non-GMO Project verified, certified carbon neutral, and certified vegan. It checks all the boxes nutrient-wise, but we did find the tablets to be on the larger side.Love Wellness Daily Love Multivitamin: This woman-owned brand is third-party tested and easy to find online. However, our tester ultimately preferred other brands over this one, and our dietitian commented that it has very high doses of some vitamins. Additionally, it contains chasteberry, an herbal supplement that can interact with common medications like birth control pills, and ashwagandha, which isn’t safe for people who are pregnant or breastfeeding.Mela Vitamins Daily Essentials for Women: It provides 300% of the DV for vitamin D, an essential nutrient that people of color are more likely to be deficient in. It’s likely only necessary if you’re low in Vitamin D. Our tester found the pills easy to swallow, and they helped her nails grow, but they didn’t provide the same energy boost she’s used to with other multivitamins.Smartypants Women’s Multi: These gummy vitamins have a subtle orange flavor that our tester enjoyed. They’re another good option if you’re looking for a gummy rather than a pill or capsule, but they do contain 6 g of added sugar.Olly Women’s Multi is another gummy option. It provides several nutrients, including B vitamins, vitamin D, and chromium. It’s also free of iron, so it may be more appropriate for some postmenopausal women. But because it’s a gummy, it contains 2 g of added sugar.Future Kind Essential Vegan Multivitamin includes only the nutrients that vegans tend to lack in their diet: vitamin B12, vitamin D, and omega-3s. It’s a great supplement for vegans who tend to eat most nutrients from food and don’t need the extra frills. It’s a quality vitamin that’s third-party tested, but since it only appeals to vegan diets, we didn’t include it in our top picks.The women’s multivitamins we chose above are more general, but if you’re interested in vitamins specific to ages 50 and up,Thorne’s Women’s Multi 50+ gets our vote.We break down why and all our multivitamin picks for women over 50 here.How we chose the best multivitamins for womenShare on PinterestWe rounded up the best multivitamins for women based on the following criteria that we believe to be important indicators of safety, quality, and transparency:Nutrient quality: We looked for products that use highly absorbable forms of nutrients.Ingredients: We included products made from quality ingredients and free of artificial additives. We also paid close attention to the types and amounts of nutrients included in each product.Health concerns: We looked for products to suit a variety of needs.Quality testing: We prioritized products tested for purity and potency, ideally by a third-party lab.Brand reputation: Every product on our list is produced by a medically credible company. We also ensured that every brand is compliant with labeling requirements per the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).Vetting: All the multivitamins on our list have been vetted to ensure they align with Healthline’s brand integrity standards and approach to well-being. You can read more about our vetting process.Once we had our list, we had testers try each vitamin for at least a week, if not longer, so they could comment on things like pill size and any positive or negative effects.Why Trust Healthline100+multivitamins evaluated55+multivitamin brands evaluated20+multivitamins personally testedHow we evaluate multivitaminsOur Medical Standards and Insights team has carefully researched and vetted over 11,000 products and services.

Which vitamins should women take daily?Before beginning any new supplement, we recommend talking with a healthcare professional. Not everyone needs to take multivitamins, and a doctor may recommend a single-nutrient vitamin instead.There are many essential nutrients. However, some are particularly important to look for in a multivitamin, either because the nutrients play a key role in women’s health specifically or because women are more likely to consume inadequate amounts of them in their diets.These nutrients include: vitamin Dvitamin Eall eight B vitamins, especially vitamin B6 and folatecalciumcholineironmagnesiumStill, keep in mind that depending on your diet, you may not need a supplement that contains all the nutrients listed above. Additionally, nutrient needs and amounts vary depending on your stage of life, among other factors.Other useful supplementsLooking to round out your wellness routine?

However, they can also increase nutrient intakes beyond the levels that are considered safe.In terms of improving overall health and preventing chronic diseases, multivitamins may play a role, but more research is needed.Research has also shown that healthy people are more likely to regularly take a multivitamin than those who have nutritional deficiencies. For this reason, the research on whether a multivitamin can improve health outcomes is inconclusive.However, a doctor may still recommend a multivitamin to help fill any nutrient gaps in your diet.Multivitamins can help certain people meet their nutrient needs.

However, multivitamins also typically contain fat-soluble vitamins, which require dietary fat for absorption, so it’s best to take them with a meal or snack.To make it easier to remember to take your multivitamin, try taking your vitamin with the same meal each day.Some vitamins, such as water-soluble vitamins, can be absorbed on an empty stomach.

Also, keep in mind that multivitamins have the potential to interact with other supplements or prescription medications.Be sure to check with a healthcare professional before beginning any new supplements, including a multivitamin. How we reviewed this article:SourcesHistoryHealthline has strict sourcing guidelines and relies on peer-reviewed studies, academic research institutions, and medical journals and associations.
