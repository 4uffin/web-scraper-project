That’s because a multivitamin is a support system, not a replacement system. If the DV percent for an ingredient is less than 100, that’s a nutrient you can be more diligent about consuming through food.Some people may have larger nutrient gaps in their diet and prefer a more comprehensive vitamin, but the majority of people can benefit from a vitamin that covers the basics.“Budget-friendly vitamins are more than up to the task of helping you crush your nutrient needs for the day,” says Kelli McGrane, MS, RD. Instead of judging by price, she recommends choosing products that are third-party tested and that include ingredients you’re not getting enough of in your diet. Consider this permission to bargain buy.A multivitamin isn’t a magical pill. Depending on the quality of your diet, you may notice more immediate effects, like improved energy. However, for many, a multivitamin is more of a long-term investment in your overall health.Our team has vetted more than 100 products to decide on the best multivitamin for men. We’ve tested more than 20, talked to experts, and devoured ingredient labels. These are the top picks we recommend for most men. Disclaimer: Some of the products tested below were provided for free.

That’s hard to beat and why we named this our best all-around pick.In addition to being verified by the United States Pharmacopeia (USP), this affordable supplement contains 22 essential vitamins and minerals, without any added herbs or superfoods.It’s widely available and easy it is to find both in store and online.Versus other contenders: It’s one of two men’s multivitamins on our list that contain calcium, so it’s ideal if you need a little extra support in that area. However, you should still be consuming more though food.It’s loaded up with B vitamins, especially B12 which is helpful for men as they age. The only other one on our list that contains more B12 is our Pure Encapsulations pick.Downsides: According to McGrane, the brand doesn’t always include the most bioavailable forms. For example, it includes forms of magnesium and zinc that aren’t as readily absorbed as others.However, she caveats that this isn’t a huge concern unless you have a deficiency. For most, the forms included are enough to support overall diet.Our score breakdownTester Review5Expert Review4What our tester saysAccording to Carson Pledger, “I live a busy lifestyle and don’t always have time to make sure I am getting all the different nutrients I need in the foods I eat or make.

$$ = $0.50 to $1.25 per servingUse code "HEALTHLINE" for 25% Off!SHOP NOW AT RITUAL4.5out of 5healthline scoreHealthline’s reviewWhy we chose it: These mint-enhanced capsules from Ritual are designed to help bridge nutrient gaps in men 18 years old and over. It’s a more minimalistic multivitamin that focuses on key nutrients for people who already consume a variety of nutrients in their daily meals.Each one-capsule serving contains the over 100% of the recommended DV for vitamins B12 and D, as well as smaller amounts of other nutrients, such as magnesium, vitamin E and zinc. It provides the most vitamin D compared to others on our list.It’s a good option if you specifically want to consume more vitamin C and B12 with some bonus nutrients you wouldn’t get if you took a dedicated vitamin D or B12 supplements.Ritual products are processed in facilities that are certified by NSF International and meet the current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) regulations set by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).They are also third-party tested by Eurofins and IEH Laboratories.Versus other contenders: Ritual’s multivitamin for men also contains the omega-3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which can support heart health.It contains 330 milligrams (mg) of omega-3 DHA per dose. Some research suggests that higher doses may be necessary to support heart health. That makes it a good bonus to have in a multivitamin and still ideal to consume more through food.Downsides: Again, Ritual multivitamins are designed to only provide a few key nutrients and aren’t as comprehensive as others on our list. But this could be a positive for those who don’t want to over do it.Our score breakdownTester Review5Expert Review4What our tester saysJoe Capraro reported an overall positive experience with Ritual’s multivitamin.“I was very satisfied with these — definitely a product I’d consider using in the future.“I had been experiencing mild anemia prior to taking these vitamins, and the B12 and folate content seemed to help bring my hemoglobin and iron levels back closer to normal range during the 90-day test period [based on blood work].“A wider range of nutrients would be nice, though.

However, they company claims to work with a third party for analytics and results. The company also hires a third party to audit its facility annually.Our score breakdownTester Review4.5Expert Review3What our tester saysChris DeRemer tried this multivitamin for 30 days.

According to the company, all Pure Encapsulations products are rigorously tested, both in house and by third-party labs, to ensure purity and potency.

It’s gluten-free, vegetarian-friendly, and free of:wheatsoydairyeggstree nutspeanutsGMOsartificial colors, flavors, and sweetenersVersus contenders: In addition to providing high percentages of all key nutrients, it also includes herbs that may be helpful for supporting prostate health.However, it also contains a high dose of vitamin E, might not be the best choice for those who are at a high risk of prostate cancer.It’s also notably high in B vitamins (the highest on our list) which may help boost energy levels if you’re not getting adequate amounts of these vitamins from your diet.Downsides: One serving contains only 12.5 micrograms (mcg), or 500 international units (IU), of vitamin D. That’s 63% of the DV for vitamin D, which may not be enough for some people.Again, it also contains a higher amount of vitamin E. According to Kelli McGrane, MD, RD, if you eat a lot of it through food, this multivitamin may contain too much.

It’s formulated with whole foods–based ingredients instead of synthetic ones, like organic Brussels sprouts and organic ginger. It was our former top pick, but we decided Nature Made was the better buy. But if organic, non-synthetic ingredients are important to you, this is a good pick.Mindbodygreen Ultimate Multivitamin+ is a very comprehensive and potent multivitamin for people who have larger nutrient gaps. It’s one of the top picks for women. However, it contains iron, a nutrient that men need about half as much compared to women. According to McGrane, consuming too much iron can lead to digestive stress and sometimes more serious issues like liver problems. She recommends sticking to an iron-free supplement unless a healthcare professional recommends otherwise (or you don’t eat enough through food).Nutricost Multivitamin for Men checks a lot of boxes in terms of nutrients, but our best overall pick by Nature Made was a little more comprehensive and costs less. This multivitamin does contain a much higher dose of Vitamin B12. If that’s a key focus for you, Nutricost may be a good fit. Our Pure Encapsulation pick above contains even more B12. However, it also contains a higher dose of vitamin E, which may not be suitable for everyone.Transparent Labs Multivitamin lacks some nutrients found in other multivitamins, such as folate and riboflavin. However, it’s still pretty comprehensive and not a bad option by any means. The main downside is that it requires 4 capsules per day. It also contains ashwagandha, which may be a bonus, but it can interact with certain prescription medications.How we chose the best multivitamins for menShare on PinterestPhotos courtesy of Carson Pledger and Luke SheppardWe narrowed down the best multivitamins for men with our expert recommendations from registered dietitians Kelli McGrane, MS, RD, and Ellen Landes MS, RDN, CPT. We looked at ingredients, nutrients each vitamin offers, third-party testing, and price.All the products on our list have been rigorously reviewed by our vetting team, and our team considered:Nutrient quality: We looked for products that use highly absorbable forms of nutrients, but note that some less absorbable forms are sufficient as long as you don’t have a deficiency. Percentage of the DV: We think it’s OK to choose a multivitamin that has less than 100% of the DV for some nutrients, especially if you regularly consume them in your diet. However, if you have nutrient deficiencies, choose a product that contains higher doses of these nutrients.Simplicity: We included products free of artificial additives. Certifications and quality: We look for seals from organizations such as USP and NSF on product packaging, which indicate that a product has been third-party tested for quality, purity, and accurate labeling.Brand reputation: The multivitamins on our list are produced by medically credible companies and comply with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) labeling requirements.Vetting: All the multivitamins on our list have been vetted to ensure they align with Healthline’s brand integrity standards and approach to well-being.

Micronutrient needs are highly personal and vary by age and sex. Chronic health conditions and medications can also affect micronutrient needs. However, adult men generally need to make sure to get enough of the following vitamins and minerals:Vitamin A: necessary for skin, eye, and immune healthB vitamins: involved in energy metabolism and red blood cell productionVitamin C: essential for the immune system and collagen productionVitamin D: important for bone, dental, immune, and prostate healthCalcium, magnesium, and vitamin K: vital for bone healthVitamin E and selenium: antioxidants that help protect cells from damageMagnesium and potassium: regulate blood pressure and heart and muscle contraction, and promote cardiovascular healthAs men age, vitamin B12 also becomes harder to absorb, and a supplement may be necessary.Who might benefit from a multivitamin?Multivitamins aren’t necessary for everyone, but if you’re unable to meet your nutrient needs through diet alone, a multivitamin could be a good idea.Men who may benefit from a multivitamin include those with: dietary restrictionsabsorption issueslimited access to nutrient-dense foodsAdditionally, as you age, it becomes harder to get enough of some nutrients, including vitamins B12 and D.But if you’re already taking dietary supplements, including some protein powders, or regularly consuming fortified foods, adding a multivitamin to your regimen could lead to an overconsumption of nutrients.It’s wise to talk with a healthcare professional about whether you could benefit from taking a multivitamin. Depending on your needs, they may advise you to take a single-nutrient supplement instead. Prostate healthSeveral multivitamins for men may contain other vitamins, minerals, herbs, or antioxidants that could be beneficial for prostate health. For example, saw palmetto and beta-sitosterol are commonly included in men’s supplements.These two substances may help support prostate health and manage urinary tract symptoms associated with benign prostate hyperplasia, or enlargement of the prostate gland. Still, more research is needed.Though supplementing with certain nutrients and plant compounds may benefit prostate health, taking high doses of vitamin E may have the opposite effect. Some nutrients and herbs may not be recommended for certain people or may have negative interactions with medications. Always consult a healthcare professional before adding a new supplement to your wellness routine.A note on vitamin E supplements for prostate healthMore research is needed, but some evidence suggests that taking high doses of supplemental vitamin E may significantly increase the risk of prostate cancer in healthy men. Because of this, it’s best to avoid supplements that contain high doses of vitamin E unless it’s specifically recommended by a qualified healthcare professional. If you have questions about the safety of vitamin E supplements, consult a healthcare professional, like a doctor or dietitian, for advice.Frequently asked questions about daily multivitamins for menShould men take a daily multivitamin?Research on the effectiveness of multivitamins is mixed, though they’re unlikely to cause harm in healthy people.A doctor may recommend a single vitamin rather than a multivitamin if a multivitamin contains nutrients you don’t need.Remember, multivitamins are not meant to replace a balanced diet, and not everyone will need a multivitamin.Research on the effectiveness of multivitamins is mixed, though they’re unlikely to cause harm in healthy people.A doctor may recommend a single vitamin rather than a multivitamin if a multivitamin contains nutrients you don’t need.Remember, multivitamins are not meant to replace a balanced diet, and not everyone will need a multivitamin.Which vitamins should men take daily?There are 13 essential vitamins and 7 main minerals adults need to get from their diets. That said, some nutrients are particularly important for men’s health include calcium, magnesium, selenium, all eight B vitamins, and vitamins A, C, D, and K.Depending on your diet, you may be able to meet your needs for these nutrients through food alone.There are 13 essential vitamins and 7 main minerals adults need to get from their diets.

However, because fat-soluble vitamins are best absorbed when taken with a meal containing healthy fats, it’s a good idea to take your multivitamin with a meal to get the most out of it.There’s no best time of day to take your multivitamin.
