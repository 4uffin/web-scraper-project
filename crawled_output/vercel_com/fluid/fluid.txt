It fails to efficiently utilize available resources during periods of inactivity.Fluid runs invocations concurrently. Overall cloud resources provisioned are dramatically reduced while invocations are kept alive in-memory.CPU that’s charged when active, not idle. No more paying for I/O wait times, network latency, and API calls.“Many of our API endpoints were lightweight and involved external requests, resulting in idle compute time. By leveraging in-function concurrency, we were able to share compute resources between invocations, cutting costs by over 50% with zero code changes.”Lead Fullstack DeveloperAI workloadsEfficient idle time. Run tasks with reduced latency and higher concurrency, delivering faster, scalable results for all users—regardless of the workload size.Business-critical APIsReliable APIs. Ensure fast, resilient API responses under heavy traffic, keeping smooth and consistent experiences.Server-side and partial pre-renderingRapid-fire dynamic rendering.
