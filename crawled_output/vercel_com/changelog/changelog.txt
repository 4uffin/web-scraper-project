As part of the overhaul, we’ve partnered with name.com as our upstream registrar, delivering better pricing and reliability.An upcoming blog will share how we built this speed using structured concurrency, layered caching, Bloom filters, and partitioned batching.Try it now at vercel.com/domains.+4Dillon M, Rhys S, Ethan N, Elliot D, Mark G, Maggie VSep 25, 2025Request collapsing for ISR cache missesThe Vercel CDN now prevents cache stampedes through request collapsing on an expired Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) page into a single function invocation per region. Without collapsing, simultaneous requests each trigger regeneration, wasting compute and overloading backends. With collapsing, one request regenerates the page while others wait and return the cached result.This improves reliability, reduces backend load, and saves significant compute at scale.The feature is applied automatically for cacheable routes. Cacheability is inferred from framework metadata, so no configuration is required.Implementation details are available in the Preventing the stampede: Request collapsing in the Vercel CDN blog post.Sachin RajaSep 24, 2025Query data on external API requests in Vercel ObservabilityObservability Plus now supports querying and visualizing external API requests.Observability Plus's query builder allows customers to explore their Vercel data and visualize traffic, performance, and other key metrics. You can now author custom queries on request counts or time to first byte (TTFB) for external API calls, such as fetch requests to an AI provider.TTFB queries include breakdowns by average, min, max, p75, p90, p95, and p99. You can also filter or group results by request hostname to focus on specific APIs.The query builder is available to Pro and Enterprise teams using Observability Plus.Learn more about Observability and Observability Plus.Tobias LinsShow moreReady to deploy?
