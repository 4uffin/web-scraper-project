With Observability Plus, you have access to an expanded data set and more options for visualizing your Vercel data than was possible with legacy Monitoring. Observability Plus also allows you to save queries and visualizations to Notebooks to share insights and collaborate with team members.Monitoring will be sunset for Pro customers at the end date of their billing cycle in November.For Pro customers still subscribed to the legacy Monitoring SKU, we recommend subscribing to Observability Plus before their November billing cycle to continue to access custom queries on their Vercel data. Pro customers who have already subscribed to Observability Plus do not need to take any action. Learn more about authoring custom queries with Observability Plus.+3Julia S, Damien S, Timo L, Chris W, Malavika TShow moreReady to deploy? Start building with a free account.
