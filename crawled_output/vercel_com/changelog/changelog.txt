You can now author custom queries on request counts or time to first byte (TTFB) for external API calls, such as fetch requests to an AI provider.TTFB queries include breakdowns by average, min, max, p75, p90, p95, and p99. You can also filter or group results by request hostname to focus on specific APIs.The query builder is available to Pro and Enterprise teams using Observability Plus.Learn more about Observability and Observability Plus.Tobias LinsSep 23, 2025Claimed deployments now include third-party resourcesAI platforms, coding tools, and workflow apps can now create projects on Vercel that users can later claim as their own, transferring deployment ownership together with any resources by third-party providers.How it works:Instant deployment: Any third-party can use the Vercel API to create a project, deploy an application, and attach a resource store (such as a database).Claim and transfer: When a user claims the Vercel deployment, the attached resources automatically move with it. Full ownership of the complete deployment is handed off to the user.This is available today through Prisma, the first Vercel Marketplace provider to support instant deployment. Prisma customers can now spin up a database and a Vercel-hosted app together as a single, bundled stack.We’re expanding this flow to more Marketplace providers so they can pair their products, such as authentication, observability, and workflow services, with Vercel deployments through one-click claiming.Check out our Claim Deployments live demo and documentation to learn more.+3Tony P, Michael T, Hedi Z, Dima V, Justin KSep 22, 2025Anomaly alerts now include error spikesEnterprise customers with Observability Plus can now be alerted when error events deviate from normal behavior, helping teams catch issues earlier.The system automatically detects and groups abnormal error patterns, such as sudden spikes in 5XX responses on a specific route. Alert detail pages include relevant log lines, making it easier to investigate and resolve the underlying cause.Error anomaly detection, joining anomaly alerts for unusual app metric usage, is available in limited beta for Enterprise customers with Observability PlusTry it out or learn more about Alerts.If you have feedback or questions, drop them in the Vercel Community thread.+3Fabio B, Damien S, Julia S, Timo L, Malavika TShow moreReady to deploy?
