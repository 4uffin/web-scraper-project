Get a trial from the Vercel team.Get an Enterprise TrialFrequently asked questions.Which Vercel plan is right for me?Our Hobby plan is for personal, non-commercial use. Pro is designed for professional developers, freelancers, and businesses who need enhanced features and team collaboration. Enterprise is for teams seeking greater performance, collaboration, and security. Contact our sales team to learn more.Do you offer custom invoicing?Yes, we offer custom invoicing for Enterprise customers. Contact our sales team to learn more.What are the limits for each plan?Our limits are listed here. Pro plans have a $20 included credit to use across resources. Finally, check out our Fair Use Policy.I went over my included credit. What can I do?We are glad you are growing with Vercel! You can continue to self serve or contact us to discuss your requirements and we can customize a plan for your team.Can I buy additional usage?Yes! On top of your included credit on Pro, you can pay as you go, uncapped. If you have a free Hobby account, you are limited to the usage caps and cannot purchase additional usage. Read more details in our documentation. I have a Hobby account, how do I upgrade to a paid plan?Thanks for continuing to use Vercel! You can upgrade to Pro directly in the Vercel dashboard.Is there a limit to how many teams I can have?No, there is not a limit.How does Vercel calculate usage?Learn more about usage in our documentation.I want to transfer a domain name to Vercel. Is there a fee?Potentially. Transfer fees are dependent on the TLD and the domain renewal fee. The domain-transfer workflow will alert you of fees before initiating transfer.Do cached responses affect usage?Caching responses can reduce the usage of Vercel Functions.If the function response is cached, it will not run and incur a Function invocation or any GB/hrs of duration. Any request made to Vercel will incur an Edge Request. Requests to static assets incur the same Fast Data Transfer usage if the response is cached or uncached.Further, Vercel automatically adds etags to all responses to prevent end users from downloading the same asset many times. Our Edge Network automatically compresses responses to reduce your Fast Data Transfer.How can I manage my spend?We provide customers with tools to observe, control, and alert on their infrastructure spend with Spend Management.All new teams have a default on-demand usage budget of $200 (which can be customized) and receive email, web, and SMS notifications as you reach that amount. When reaching 100%, you can optionally configure Vercel to automatically pause all projects with a hard limit.Over the past year, we've added features to the platform based on your feedback to help automatically prevent runaway spend, including recursion protection, improved function defaults, hard spend limits, Attack Challenge Mode, and more.Not sure which plan to pick?
