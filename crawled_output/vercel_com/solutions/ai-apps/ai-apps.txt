Vercel didn't just speed us up; it changed how we innovate.​​​​‌”Peter Runham, Co-Founder & CTOThe future of AI frontends is on Vercel.Vercel provides the tools and infrastructure to build and deploy robust, secure, and performant AI applications quickly.Build with the AI SDK.Ship AI products faster with a framework built to eliminate boilerplate code and standardize integrating model providers.Iterate on ideas faster.Stay in the flow by managing feature flags and preview comments from within the Vercel Toolbar on preview URLs.Deploy to AI-ready infra.Vercel's industry leading managed infrastructure lets you launch performant AI projects at scale instantly.From the creators of Next.js, the Vercel AI SDK gives you the tools you need to build AI-powered products.AI SDK CoreA unified API for generating text, structured objects, embeddings, and tool calls with LLMs.AI SDK UIA set of framework-agnostic hooks for quickly building chat, completion, and assistant frontends. AI SDK RSCA library to stream data and generative UI components with React Server Components (RSC). Your toolkit for AI Apps.Serverless deploymentsAutomatically handle the demanding needs of AI, without the infrastructure complexity.Zero-config streamingStream long-running LLM responses, improving user experience and performance.Edge cachingCache LLM responses globally so you can serve data to your users as fast as possible.﻿‍﻿﻿﻿Preview commentsLet everyone on the team provide feedback directly on real deployments with preview comments.Feature flag managementManage feature flags with the Vercel Toolbar so you can release new AI features safely and with confidence﻿‌.Skew protectionMinimize user-facing errors during rollout. Make sure all your deployments stay in sync.Efficiency gains that pay offServer-like concurrency, in a serverless worldIn-function concurrency enables a single Vercel Function to handle multiple invocations simultaneously, optimizing resource usage and turning efficiency gains into savings.Traditional serverless wastes idle time. It fails to efficiently utilize available resources during periods of inactivity.Fluid runs invocations concurrently. Overall cloud resources provisioned are dramatically reduced while invocations are kept alive in-memory.CPU that’s charged when active, not idle. No more paying for I/O wait times, network latency, and API calls.Protecting your AI-powered apps.
