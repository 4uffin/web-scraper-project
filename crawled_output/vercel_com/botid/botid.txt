Our launch drew global users, including sophisticated bots. No other provider had this at-scale bot detection with easy developer experience. We now protect key product usage actions on Yupp with Vercel BotID.”Pankaj Gupta, Cofounder and CEOFrequently Asked QuestionsIs BotID always on?You choose the routes. BotID only runs where you configure protected paths and components.Does it replace CAPTCHA?Yes. BotID verifies sessions invisibly. There is no user interaction.How is it different from basic bot detection?BotID runs detection scripts inside the session. It is resistant to spoofing, replay, and inspection.Is BotID available to everyone?BotID is available for all teams, with Deep Analysis checks available for Pro and Enterprise teams.Can I enable BotID selectively?Yes. BotID supports per-component protection. You can apply it only where needed, like checkout, signup, or AI endpoints.Will it impact performance or latency?No. Detection runs asynchronously inside the client session and integrates into your existing routing logic.Does BotID store user data?No. It evaluates session validity without storing user behavior or PII.How does it differ from scoring systems?Scoring models estimate bot likelihood using heuristics. BotID deterministically validates session authenticity. It returns a simple pass or fail, rather than an ambiguous score.What frameworks does it support?BotID works natively with all frameworks. It can be used with any frontend served with Vercel.Do I need to tune or configure bots?No. There are no bots to manage or IP blocks, rate limits, or thresholds to tune.How is BotID priced?BotID includes a free Basic mode and a paid Deep Analysis mode.
