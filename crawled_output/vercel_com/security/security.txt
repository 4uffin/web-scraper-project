Vercel Enterprise customers are covered by two forms of DDoS protection. Our systems can automatically detect and block malicious attacks on customer sites.

For more information, our Privacy Policy explains how information is collected, used, processed and disclosed by Vercel.Is Vercel ISO 27001 certified?Yes, Vercel is ISO 27001:2013 certified.

Contact us for more details or to access these reports.Can I protect my deployments?Yes. Vercel offers flexible access options. Any plan has access to Deployment Protection which include Vercel Authentication and Shareable Links (Hobby plan limited to 1 link per account). Customers on the pro plan can opt-in to Advanced Deployment Protection for $150 which offers Password Protection, Deployment Protection Exceptions and Private Production Deployments.Does Vercel encrypt data?Yes. Data is encrypted at rest (AES-256) and in transit (HTTPS / TLS), including sensitive information like access tokens and secrets.Does Vercel backup the data on its platform?Yes. Our current backup interval is every two hours and each backup is persisted for 30 days. Automatic backups are taken without affecting the performance or availability of the database operations. All the backups are stored separately in a storage service, and those backups are globally replicated for resiliency against regional disasters. If a database instance is deleted, all associated backups are also automatically deleted. Backups are periodically tested by the Vercel engineering team.What infrastructure does Vercel use?The Vercel Edge Network & deployment platform primarily uses Amazon Web Services (AWS). In the case of an AWS outage, our network is resilient to regional downtime.
Vercel will automatically route traffic to the nearest available edge. Vercel.com uses Azure CosmosDB to store and globally replicate data,
which is different than our Edge Network. This is an additional step
taken to ensure uptime for applications on our platform.Does Vercel provide infrastructure segregation?Enterprise Teams on Vercel have their own build infrastructure ensuring

daily code reviews, static analysis checks, and dependency scanning at
the code level. Our cloud security posture management platform (CSPM)
facilitates workload vulnerability scanning. Pro and Enterprise
customers can request access to our latest annual penetration testing reports.Does Vercel use subprocessors?Yes, a list of our current subprocessors can be found on our subprocessors page.
