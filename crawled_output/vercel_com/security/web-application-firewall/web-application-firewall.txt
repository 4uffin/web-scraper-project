Due to how the Vercel infrastructure is configured, a request cannot bypass the Vercel Firewall or WAF once enabled. Rules are evaluated against the incoming request in the order they are configured and act according to any actions met.What types of attacks does Vercel’s WAF protect against?The Vercel WAF can be customized to a business’s own priorities to stop Layer 7/application layer attacks based on 15+ parameters like target path, request path, headers, cookies, user agents, JA3/JA4 digests, and more.The system Vercel Firewall protects against Layer 3 attacks like DDoS and SYN flood attacks, while managed rulesets help protect against OWASP Top 10 risks like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).Can the WAF be customized?Yes, you can customize rules and policies to fit your specific security needs.Does the WAF provide logging and reporting?Yes, it offers detailed logs and reports on security events and blocked threats by visiting the Firewall tab within the dashboard. The Firewall visibility is performed on a per-project basis and can link directly to Monitoring queries that can be used to conduct deeper investigations.Is the WAF compatible with all types of web applications?The WAF is embedded within the Vercel Edge Network and is therefore designed to work with all web applications hosted on Vercel. Prior to fulfilling any request, the WAF rules will be evaluated.How do I enable the WAF for my Vercel project?Go to your dashboard > Project > Firewall tab. For more information, read the documentation.Can I configure different rules for different projects?Yes, you can set up different WAF configurations for each project.Is it possible to block based on IP addresses?Yes, you can configure WAF to block IP addresses in two ways: either via the business logic of a custom firewall rule or by leveraging WAF IP Blocks which performs IP denies even earlier in the request lifecycle.How often should I update my WAF rules?It’s recommended to review and update your rules regularly, especially after significant changes to your application.Does the WAF impact my application’s performance?The WAF is embedded into the same request lifecycle flow of the Vercel Edge Network and is designed to have minimal impact on performance while providing robust security.Can the WAF handle high-traffic websites?Yes, it’s built to scale and can handle high-traffic websites efficiently.How can I test if my WAF rules are working correctly?Prior to publishing a WAF rule with an action that would affect users, you can publish an active firewall rule with a “log” action which will enable you to passively observe how the rule would affect traffic. Upon evaluating the behavior of the rule, you can either further customize them or update the rule with the intended action.What happens if there’s a false positive with my WAF rules?You can adjust your WAF rules to reduce false positives, you are in full control of your WAF and changes propagate globally in around 300ms, meaning any changes you publish will immediately reflect globally.Is the WAF compatible with my custom domains?Yes, it works with custom domains configured in your Vercel project.Ready to deploy?
