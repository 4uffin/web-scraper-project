How To Pitch Us
At VICE, the story has always been the star. The best pitches are succinct and focused. They have a firm grasp on why the story is interesting and original, what makes it a natural fit for VICE, and the reporting that will take it to the next level. When possible, point to specific sources you want to interview and note if access could be an issue. Lastly, tell us why you’re the right person to tell this story. Do you have a foothold in the right communities? What knowledge or expertise do you bring?
Most editors want to work on shaping the story with you, so it’s better not to send completed drafts. Instead, please send a succinct pitch via email to pitches@vice.com.
