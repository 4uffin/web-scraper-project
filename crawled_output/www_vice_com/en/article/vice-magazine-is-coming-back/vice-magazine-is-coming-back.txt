The latest issue of Vice magazine is our summer 2025 edition: THE REASONS TO BE CHEERFUL ISSUE. To subscribe to four print issues each year, click here. To ensure that THE REASONS TO BE CHEERFUL ISSUE is the first in your package, subscribe by Friday, August 29.
2025 sees the glorious return of VICE magazine to print, marking a new golden era of weird and wonderful reportage in a totally messed-up world.
For the first time in six years, an elite team of our greatest writers and photographers has been gathered together in 120 pages that you can hold in your hands, smell with your nose, tear into tiny pieces, and frame on your living room wall. But like everything else in modern life, if you want it to exist, you have to pay for it. Don’t blame us, blame market forces!
The year began with The Rock Bottom Issue, and 2025’s second installment—The Reasons To Be Cheerful Issue—is currently landing on the doorsteps of our paying members. The third, an historic issue in the pantheon of VICE magazine, is just around the corner…
What You’ll Get and What It Costs
For $70 per year, you can get our full-works print and digital membership—you’ll receive all 4 print issues of the magazine per year straight to your door, as well as exclusive access to the paywalled Members Only section of VICE.com.
While print is back, that doesn’t mean we’re leaving the internet behind. With a digital membership, you can jump the paywall into our Members Only Section, where you’ll get exclusive early access to brand new VICE documentaries before they’re streaming anywhere else, as well as members-only content from our best writers and columnists.
If, for some reason, you don’t want the magazine, you can get an annual digital-only membership for $20 a year—or $2 per month, if you’d rather do it that way.
The cash we raise through this will be funneled straight back into making more great video and written editorial for you to gorge yourselves silly upon. It’s a virtuous cycle, insert yourself into it by browsing the various membership options below.
Shortly after signing up for the print subscription, you will receive an email asking you to confirm your shipping address. By signing up you agree to our privacy policy, terms and conditions, and our fulfilment policy.
