About TechCrunch
TechCrunch gives readers a front-row seat to the future of innovation. It’s where founders, operators, investors, and everyone else who is tech-curious learn what’s next, discover unexpected stories, and glean critical intelligence. We’re at the forefront of the AI revolution, the ebbs and flows of investment, and bring together individuals across all sectors of technology for our premier events throughout the year, culminating in our flagship TechCrunch Disrupt conference that’s now celebrating its 20th anniversary.
We’ve seen a surge of impersonators actively using the names of current TechCrunch employees as part of fraudulent schemes. If you’re approached online by an individual claiming to represent TechCrunch, use caution. This page is kept up to date to reflect the current team. If something feels off about any outreach you receive, please let us know by contacting anyone on this page to verify authenticity.
