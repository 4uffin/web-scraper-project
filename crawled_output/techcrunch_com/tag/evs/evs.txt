EVs
Electric vehicles are having a shaky trip so far. Tesla, the biggest name within the space, has substantially cut its workforce as demand slows and the Cybertruck’s launch stalls. And it’s not alone: Newer companies like Faraday Future and Rivian are struggling to establish themselves, and established automakers like GM and Toyota face challenges meeting sales targets for their EVs. TechCrunch deeply covers the space, from the vehicles hitting the roads to the turbulence at EV makers like Fisker.
