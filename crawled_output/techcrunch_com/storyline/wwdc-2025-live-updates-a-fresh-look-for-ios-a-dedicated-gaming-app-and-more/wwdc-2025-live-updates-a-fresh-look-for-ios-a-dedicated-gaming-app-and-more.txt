June 8, 2025 – June 8, 2025
It’s finally time for WWDC 2025, Apple’s biggest developer conference of the year. It’s also a chance for Apple to notch a win.
There’s considerable pressure on the company to build on its promises and to make amends to developers as it lags behind in AI and faces continued legal challenges over its App Store.
WWDC begins Monday and ends Wednesday, but the main event is the keynote, which kicks off the conference at 10 a.m. PT.
We’re expecting tons of reveals, so stick with us to get the latest from Apple’s big show.

Apple announced a slew of updates to visionOS 26, the operating system powering its mixed reality headset. The updates build off last year’s Apple Vision Pro spatial computer that blends digital content with the physical world.
At WWDC, Apple announced a range of updates for both consumer and enterprise customers, from new spatial widgets and content to more realistic Personas and more.

Apple introduces an AI-powered Shortcuts app
At WWDC 2025, Apple showed off a new AI-powered Shortcuts app.
The company says Shortcuts can now tap into Apple Intelligence directly, and developers will be able to access Apple’s on-device large language model (LLM).
With Shortcuts, users will be able to access the AI models either on device or with Private Compute to generate responses that feed into the rest of their shortcut. For instance, a student could create a shortcut that uses AI to compare their audio transcription of their class lecture to their notes, then add key points they missed. They can also tap into ChatGPT to provide further responses that feed into their shortcut’s input.
Users will be able to tap into intelligent actions, which are a new type of shortcut that’s enabled by Apple Intelligence. For instance, there are dedicated actions like those for summarizing text with AI (Apple Intelligence’s Writing Tools) or creating images with Image Playground.
Apple says the new features are available for testing starting Monday.

iPadOS 26 just sherlocked Riverside
In good news for podcasters, iPadOS 26 is adding a local capture feature, which allows users to make high-quality recordings on the iPad from any videoconferencing app. Then, audio and video files can be easily shared once the recording is over. While this feature is convenient for creators, it could be a kiss of death for Riverside, a premium cloud video and audio recording tool that has been a boon for remote podcasters.

Apple brings Preview app to iPad OS 26
Apple today introduced an iPad OS version of Preview, an app that allows users to view, mark up, and modify images and PDFs.
Preview for iPad gives users a range of tools, including markup using Apple Pencil and AutoFill. Users can also export images in different formats.
Pencil support should be particularly helpful in signing documents. Previously, Mac users had to rely on stored signatures, which are digitized by holding a paper copy up to the built-in camera.
The addition of the app brings another feature to iPads that Mac users have long enjoyed.
Apart from the Finder, Preview is one of the oldest macOS apps still in use today, tracing its origins to late-1980s NeXTSTEP, the operating system that brought Steve Jobs back to Apple. NeXTSTEP was heavily remodeled to create the first generation of Mac OS X, which in turn formed the basis of the first iPad OS.

Logitech Muse and PlayStation VR2 Sense controller coming to Apple Vision Pro
Along with updates to visionOS, Apple’s Vision Pro AR/VR headset is getting some new accessories. Logitech Muse, a stylus tool, will allow users to sketch in their environment, which could be helpful for architects or artists sketching a new design.
For gamers, PlayStation’s VR2 Sense controllers will be compatible with the Apple Vision Pro, expanding the headset’s capacity to be used as a gaming console.

Apple Wallet gains new travel-friendly features in iOS 26
Apple Wallet is getting a bit more travel-friendly. The app will soon be able to hold a digital version of your passport, and boarding passes will gain new features that promise to make traveling a little bit easier.
The new passport feature is “not a replacement for your physical passport,” Apple said, but it can be used in apps that need to verify age and identity and at supported TSA checkpoints. Digital passports could help procrastinators who have yet to get their Real ID.
Boarding passes have long been stored in the Wallet app, allowing for quick access from the lock screen. But with iOS 26, they’re getting a host of new features. Boarding passes will now include links to terminal maps so it’s easier to find your way to the gate or to baggage claim.
Once at the claim, Wallet’s new link to Find My should come in handy, allowing users to check the boarding pass to track the progress of their AirTagged luggage.

macOS Tahoe includes big update to Spotlight
Spotlight is getting a big upgrade, in large part due to Apple Intelligence. Now when you search something on Spotlight, you’ll see all types of results (files, folders, events, apps, messages) listed together and ranked using AI based on relevance to the user.
With filtering options, you can narrow down your search by specifically searching for a PDF, for example. Spotlight can also be used to carry out specific tasks, like sending an email, creating a note, or playing a podcast. And with quick keys, users can set short strings of characters that get them to a specific action they assign.

Meet macOS Tahoe
The new macOS will be named Tahoe, after the scenic lake situated between California and Nevada. Tahoe syncs with iOS with Continuity features, like displaying Live Activities, such as the status of an Uber Eats order. Plus, the Liquid Glass redesign will extend to macOS, giving users more opportunities to customize their screen — you can even change the color of a folder on your desktop.
