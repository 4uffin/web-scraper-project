Privacy Policy
Effective date: May 1, 2025
TechCrunch Media, LLC (“TechCrunch,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy (this “Privacy Policy”) explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you visit or interact with our websites, mobile applications (if any), and other products and services that reference this Privacy Policy, including our events (collectively, the “Services”).
This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected through your use of the Services and does not apply to information collected offline or through any other means.
Information We Collect
This section explains, for different situations, what information we may collect directly from you (either on a voluntary basis or through automated means) and what information may be collected (or we may receive) from other sources. Some of this information may be considered “personal information” under various applicable laws. We consider information that identifies you as a specific, identified individual to be personal information (such as your name, telephone number, and e-mail address), as well as additional information, including IP addresses and cookie identifiers, where required by applicable law. And, if we combine information that we consider to be non-personal with personal information, we will treat the combined information as personal information under this Privacy Policy. In the limited circumstances in which we may process sensitive personal information as defined by applicable law, we process such information as permitted by and in compliance with applicable law. Note that we may de-identify personal information so that it is non-personal, such as by aggregating it or transforming it into information that does not identify you. We will treat de-identified information as non-personal to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. Where collection is mandatory, we may not be able to provide you with the Service you requested if you choose not to provide that information to us (e.g., name and delivery address for the delivery of a Service). Please see the supplemental notices further below for additional information that may apply to you based on your location.
We, or service providers that assist us in providing, maintaining, and operating the Services, may collect the following types of personal information from you:
Information that you provide. We may collect information that you choose to provide to us (including content that you submit to us or when you subscribe to our newsletter(s) or provide us with content for our websites). This may include information such as your name, e-mail address, phone number, year of birth, gender, zip code, country, postal address, username, password, and password reminder questions and answers. We may ask you for information when you register or subscribe, or at other times—such as when you enter a contest, take a survey, participate in a promotion, provide content, or order Services from us. We may be required by law to collect certain personal data about you or as a consequence of any contractual relationship we have with you. If you have purchased any Services, you may be required to provide payment information such as your credit card number (processed by our third-party payment processor) and expiration date, where appropriate to process a financial transaction that you have requested. Failure to provide this information may prevent or delay the fulfillment of these obligations.
Automated information. Using technologies that are widely used on the Internet, such as cookies, web beacons, and other technologies (“Cookies”), we also may automatically collect information about your computer or mobile device and online activity when you access the Services. Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser; they are used to record how you navigate our websites on each visit. When we refer to cookies, this term includes all means by which we may store information on an end-user’s device and/or retrieve information that is stored on such end-user’s device beforehand., including through equivalent server-side tracking. The information collected by these cookies and similar technologies may include your: IP address; unique cookie identifier and information obtained through cookies; unique device identifier and device type; domain, browser type and language, operating system, and system settings; country and time zone; previously visited websites; information about your interaction with our Platform such as click behavior, purchases and indicated preferences; and access times and referring URLs.
Location information. When you use the Services, we may collect information about your location separately from other information that you provide to us explicitly. For instance, we may use your IP address, your mobile device’s GPS signal, or information about nearby WiFi access points and cell towers to help determine your geographic location.
Social networking information. The Services contain integration with social networks and other platforms in which information is shared between us and such platforms. For example, if you create or log into your account through a third-party social media site, we may have access to certain information from that site, such as your name, email address, account information, photo and friends lists, and other information in accordance with the authorization procedures determined by such social media site. If you don’t want a social network to collect the information about you as described above, or you don’t want a social network to share it with us, please review the privacy policy, privacy settings and instructions of the applicable social network before you visit and use our Services.
Information from other sources. We may combine the information that we collect with information that we obtain from other sources, such as our owners, our past and present affiliates, including our business partners, licensees, contractors, and service providers. For example, we may ask a service provider to supply us with demographic information or updated contact information for you. For more information about the third parties from which we collect your personal data, please contact us at the contact information below.
How We Use Your Information
We use the information that we collect about you for these purposes:
to contact you to provide information about TechCrunch or other products or services in which we believe you may be interested, including newsletters, promotional emails, legal notices;
to manage your account (if any);
to provide you the Services;
to post content you provide to us;
to respond to your requests, questions, and comments;
to personalize content and experiences, including providing recommendations based on your preferences;
to maintain, protect, optimize or improve our Services and operations, including to personalize and improve your experiences and/or tailor any communications that we may send you;
to detect, investigate, and prevent activities that may violate our policies or be illegal;
to perform statistical, demographic, and marketing analyses of users of the Services and their purchasing patterns;
compile aggregate data about traffic and interaction with the Services;
to identify and prevent fraud and other criminal activities;
to process any information regarding your account and your use of our Services as is necessary in the context of corporate acquisitions, mergers or other corporate transactions;
for internal business purposes, such as improving our Services and to comply with legal requirements and our business practices, such as our recordkeeping, backup, and document retention policies;
as we believe is necessary to protect our rights and the rights of others, including by enforcing our Terms of Use; and
and as otherwise described to you at the point of collection or pursuant to your consent.
We also do research on our users’ demographics, interests, and behavior to help us operate our Services, for other business purposes, and in connection with our display of advertising (which we describe below). This research is based on the information you provide to us including upon registration during a promotion, in surveys, and on your use of our Services.
Sharing Your Information
We share non-personal information, such as aggregated statistics and de-identified information, with third parties to the extent permitted by applicable law. TechCrunch also shares personal information as provided in this Privacy Policy.
We may share the information that we collect about you through the Services in these ways:
Affiliated Brands & Companies: We may share your information between various brands owned by TechCrunch or under common control.
Service Providers: We partner with third parties to assist with many aspects of the Services, such as sending emails or hosting web services. These third parties may provide services related to any of the purposes described in How We Use Your Information, and we may share with them any types of information described in Information We Collect. We may also receive information collected by these third parties and combine it with the information we have collected. Some of these third parties may be located outside the United States or the nation in which you reside. Your information may also be collected and processed by third parties, such as the payment providers you select (if you purchase Services), who will process your information independently in accordance with their own privacy notices.
Business Partners: We may share your personal data with our channel partners to fulfill obligations and requests in connection with the Services, and/or conduct contests or sweepstakes. The privacy policies of such third parties apply to their use and disclosure of your information that we collect and disclose to such third-party companies. We may share with them the types of information described in Information We Collect. We may also receive information collected by these third parties and combine it with the information we have collected.
Social Media Services, if you log into the Services with a social media service or if you connect a social media account with the Services. In that case, we disclose certain of your personal information to that social media service depending on your settings. The social media service’s privacy policy then applies to their practices regarding your information.
Other Third Parties: We may disclose your personal information if we believe it is necessary to protect and defend our rights, property, or safety or when we believe the disclosure is necessary to protect the rights, property, or safety of another, including for the purpose of enforcing our Terms of Use, or where the law and / or government authorities require. This disclosure may include legal requests from a jurisdiction outside of the United States when we have a good faith belief that the response is required by law, regulation, court order, or other legal request or process in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally-recognized standards.
Parties to a Business Transaction: We may disclose or transfer your information in connection with or during negotiation of any merger, ﬁnancing, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, or any other transaction or proceeding involving sale, transfer, divestiture, or disclosure of all or a portion of our business or assets to another company.
Other Disclosures: We may disclose your information to other third parties when we have your consent or direction to do so.
In addition, if you provide content to the Services, such as through posting on our websites, any information that you submit will become public. It may become accessible through search engines or, if you sign in using credentials from a third-party social networking service, to users on that service. Unless otherwise noted, we do not limit the distribution of information that you share using these features.
TechCrunch has implemented Google’s Invisible reCAPTCHA technology on our site. Use of the Invisible reCAPTCHA is subject to the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.
Relevant Advertising
We serve you tailored ads both on and off our Services. We may use demographic and preference information to facilitate the delivery of targeted ads, promotions and offers. This means users see advertising that is most likely to interest them, and advertisers send their messages to people who are most likely to be receptive, improving both the viewer’s experience and the effectiveness of the ads. We offer you choices regarding personalized ads but you cannot opt-out of seeing other ads.
We may transmit website usage information about your use of the Services to third parties in order to show you advertising when you visit other sites. For more information about our third-party ad server, and to learn about your choices about targeted advertising, please click here.
We adhere to self-regulatory principles for interest-based advertising and participate in industry opt-outs from such ads. This does not opt you out of receiving all advertising; you will continue to get other ads by advertisers not listed with these self-regulatory tools.
You can opt-out from interest-based advertising here or in the EU, here, or in Canada, here.
Your access to our websites should not be affected if you do not accept cookies served by third parties.
Does this Privacy Policy apply to information collected through third-party offerings?
We sometimes partner with third parties that operate platforms or offer services that you can use to access or otherwise interact with our content and offerings. For example, you can access TechCrunch on your Apple iPad or iPhone. Similarly, we may include in some of our Services features that integrate with third-party social networking services or other third-party services. To do this, we may include in our web pages and apps code from the social networking service provider or other third party. This code may allow the service provider to collect information about your activities. If you are logged into social networking or other third-party services at the time, the service providers may also be able to identify you in connection with that information.
Although this Privacy Policy will apply to our use of information collected about you through these co-branded offerings, we do not control the privacy practices of our third-party partners. As a result, we want you to be aware that when you use these offerings you may be providing information to both us and our partner, and you should review the partner’s privacy policy to be sure that you know how it will use any data that it collects.
TechCrunch contains links to other sites, including third party payment processors and affiliate marketing links encoded by third parties. Please be aware that TechCrunch is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personal data. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by TechCrunch. If you choose to purchase a product or service via our site, some special terms apply. Payments are handled by a third-party payment processor, whose own terms and privacy policy will govern your transaction. We do not process, record or maintain your credit card, bank account or payment information, though the third-party payment processor and/or the merchant may provide us with some data relating to your order, such as what you purchased and how much you spent, etc. We expressly disclaim any and all liability related to your use of any third-party payment processor’s system, including its privacy practices. Also, we are not responsible for any fulfillment of product that you purchase from merchants or any issues relating to such product(s) or customer service.
Security
We maintain appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect the personal information you provide on this website against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure or use and other unlawful forms of processing. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure and you use the Services and transmit information to us at your own risk. If you have any questions about security on our Services, please contact us as provided below.
How Long We Retain Your Information
We keep the personal information we collect for the duration of our relationship with you, plus a reasonable period in order to take into account the applicable legal retention requirement or statute of limitation period, or otherwise as required for our business purposes described in this Privacy Policy.
If you consent to receive marketing communications, we will keep the information necessary to send you these communications for as long as we have a legitimate business purpose to retain the data, as long as permitted by law, or until you request we delete the data if such a right exists in your jurisdiction.
At the end of the retention period, your personal information will be deleted completely or anonymized so that it can be used in a non-identifiable way for statistical and analytical purposes.
Data Transfers
Your information will be collected, processed, and stored directly on or transferred to servers in the U.S. In addition, it may be transferred to other countries where TechCrunch, its affiliates, or third-party business partners maintain facilities or business operations, which may include countries outside Canada, the United Kingdom (UK) or European Economic Area (EEA). No matter where the information is located, TechCrunch takes commercially reasonable measures to safeguard your privacy rights in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the collection, processing, storage and transfer of your information, please do not provide your information to us and stop using our Services. If you have questions, please contact us as provided below.
Your Choices and Rights
Communications Preferences
You are free to withdraw your consent and opt out of receiving marketing emails and/or newsletters from TechCrunch by following the instructions in any such email you receive, emailing us at opt-out@techcrunch.com or by logging into your online account and adjusting your preferences. Please note that if you do opt out, it may take a few days to process your request and that you may continue to receive promotional or marketing materials during this time. Opting out will not preclude us from sending you other types of non-promotional messages, such as emails confirming transactions.
Google Ads opt out. If you would prefer not to receive advertisements through the Services that are targeted to your interests, you can inform our advertising vendor, Google, Inc., of your preference by clicking the “Opt out” button at www.google.com/privacy_ads.html . You also can manage your advertising preferences at www.google.com/ads/preferences/ .
We may use certain web analytics services, including Google Analytics, to help us understand and analyze how visitors use our Services. For more information on how Google Analytics uses data collected through our Services, visit tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout . You may also be able to opt-out of Google Analytics by visiting tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout .
Other targeted ads opt outs. In some cases, we and advertisers on the Services work with other third-party vendors to help deliver advertisements targeted to your interests. These vendors include ad networks and analytics providers, and they use cookies or other technologies to collect information about your online activity (e.g., the sites and pages you have visited) in order to help advertisers deliver particular ads that they believe you would find most relevant. Many third-party vendors that perform these functions are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, and you can opt out of those vendors’ delivery of targeted advertising to you by visiting www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp and https://youradchoices.com/control/ .
Please note that, because these opt-out tools will place a cookie on your computer to record your opt-out preference, any actions you take using these tools will apply only to the web browser that you use to take the action. Also, these tools may not work as expected if you set your browser to refuse cookies.
Sometimes, our advertisers will contract with a third-party service to host their ads. In this case, an ad-serving vendor contacts the advertisers’ hosting service to obtain a particular advertisement. Because we do not have a relationship with these third parties, we do not have a mechanism to allow visitors to opt out of tracking by these vendors.
Your Rights
Under certain circumstances, you have the right by law to:
request access to your personal data that we hold;
request correction of the personal data we hold about you if it is incorrect, out of date or incomplete;
request erasure of your personal data, for example where the information is no longer necessary for the purpose which it was collected for, or you withdraw your consent for us to hold such information;
object to processing of your personal data;
request the restriction of processing of your personal data, for example where you suspect the information held is inaccurate, or is being used in an unlawful manner but you do not want it to be erased (i.e. if required for establishment or defense of a legal claim);
request that we transfer your personal data to another organization, where it is technically feasible; and/or
withdraw your consent at any time and request we discontinue any consent-based processing of your personal data after you withdraw that consent.
Please note that where you subsequently object to our processing, or otherwise request that your data is erased, we will be required to retain some of your personal data until we have delivered your ordered goods or performed your requested services, unless you inform us you wish to cancel your order.
When exercising any of the rights listed above, we will ask you to verify your identity before proceeding to ensure that your personal data is adequately protected from unauthorized use. Likewise, if you have authorized a third party to submit a request on your behalf, we will ask them to prove they have your permission to act. Please see the supplemental notices below for more information relevant to your jurisdiction, if applicable.
Children’s Privacy
Our Services are not directed to children under the age of 13 and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If we become aware that we have inadvertently received personal information from a visitor under the age of 13 on our Services, we will delete the information from our records, unless we have a legitimate interest or are under a legal obligation to postpone deletion.
