This week on Equity, Anthony Ha, Kirsten Korosec, and Max Zeff unpack the biggest moves in AI, robotics, and regulation. Listen to the full episode to hear about:
Meta Connect’s AR/AI vision and neural wristband control (plus the demos that didn’t go as planned).
Jack Altman’s rapid $275 million fundraise and the Altman brothers’ expanding Silicon Valley influence.
The Waymo-Lyft partnership bringing robotaxis to Nashville and the hunt for profitable AV models.
California’s new AI safety legislation and what it means for Big Tech.
Why investors may soon call this the “golden age of robotics.”
