Nothing has revealed its first over-the-ear headphones. The aluminum and transparent Headphone (1) was designed in collaboration with KEF. They offer adaptive noise canceling, bass enhancement for deeper low frequencies, and spatial audio, for $299 at launch. But spoiler alert: The buttons on these headphones might be the best part.
