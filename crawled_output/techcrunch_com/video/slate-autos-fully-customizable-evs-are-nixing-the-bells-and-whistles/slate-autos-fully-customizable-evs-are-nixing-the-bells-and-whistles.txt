Slate Auto’s fully customizable EVs are nixing the bells and whistles
TC Video
4:48 AM PDT · September 8, 2025
Jeff Bezos-backed Slate Auto has come out of stealth, with EVs built without all the high-tech bells and whistles as it tries to hit a significantly lower price point for its vehicles. The Blank Slate truck doesn’t even come with paint, which allows customers to fully customize their ride and skip costly add-ons that they don’t need. And the existence of Slate was exclusively confirmed by own our Sean O’Kane, who revealed the formerly secretive Michigan startup in April.
