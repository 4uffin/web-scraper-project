Apple’s new Center Stage Camera always keeps you in frame
TC Video
11:15 AM PDT · September 9, 2025
The biggest takeaway from the iPhone 17’s new front camera? You won’t have to rotate your phone to take a landscape selfie. The new square sensor allows for multiple aspect ratios to be captured at once; you just have to click to expand or switch between compositions. And that’s just the start of the phone’s new features, as revealed at Apple’s iPhone 17 reveal event, not to mention the implications of the iPhone 17 Pro’s potent camera on manufacturers targeting vloggers and content creators.
