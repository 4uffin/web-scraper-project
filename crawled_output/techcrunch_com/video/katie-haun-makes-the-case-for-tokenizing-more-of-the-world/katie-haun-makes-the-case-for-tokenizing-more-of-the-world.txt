Katie Haun makes the case for tokenizing more of the world
TC Video
9:43 AM PDT · June 19, 2025
Katie Haun, founder of Haun Ventures, is a leading voice at the intersection of crypto, policy, and venture capital and shares what it takes to invest with conviction in volatile, high-stakes markets. From her DOJ roots to building a $1.5B+ firm, Katie offers a rare, inside look at navigating regulatory headwinds, backing bold founders, and building trust with LPs across cycles.
Haun joined us at our StrictlyVC Menlo Park event in June 2025, among several other speakers whose discussions you can find here.
