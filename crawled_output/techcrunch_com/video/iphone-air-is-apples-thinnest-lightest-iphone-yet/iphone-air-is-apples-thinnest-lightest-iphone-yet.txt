iPhone Air is Apple’s thinnest, lightest iPhone yet
TC Video
11:15 AM PDT · September 9, 2025
Apple announced a new iPhone Air, coming in at just 145 grams and a 5.5mm thickness as the company tries to pack a punch in a slim design.
Does that also mean we might see a foldable iPhone in the near future? Apple remains behind on that form factor, but the Air brings it one step closer to competing with the likes of Samsung and Google’s foldable lineups.
