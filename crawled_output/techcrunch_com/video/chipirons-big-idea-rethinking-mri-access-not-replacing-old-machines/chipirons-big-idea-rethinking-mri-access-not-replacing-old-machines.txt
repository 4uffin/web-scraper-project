Chipiron’s big idea: rethinking MRI access, not replacing old machines
Theresa Loconsolo
3:00 PM PDT · September 24, 2025
Medical device funding is hitting levels we haven’t seen since 2021, with investors pouring billions into diagnostics and imaging companies. While innovation has raced ahead, a fundamental problem still hasn’t changed: Critical medical hardware like MRI machines cost millions of dollars and is limited to large hospitals. So how do you take one of the most expensive, hospital-bound technologies and make it available anywhere?
Evan Kervella, founder and CEO of Paris-based startup Chipiron, joined Equity to walk us through the problem and his vision for solving it.
Equity is TechCrunch’s flagship podcast, produced by Theresa Loconsolo, and posts every Wednesday and Friday.
