How Chipiron’s rethinking the future of MRI

Medical device funding is hitting levels we haven’t seen since 2021, with investors pouring billions into diagnostics and imaging companies. But while innovation has raced ahead, a fundamental problem still hasn’t changed: Critical medical hardware (like MRI machines) costs millions of dollars and is gatekept by large hospitals. So how do you take one of the most expensive, hospital-bound technologies and make it available anywhere?
Evan Kervella, founder and CEO of Paris-based startup Chipiron, joined Equity to walk us through the problem and his vision for solving it.
Listen to the full episode to hear about:
The unscalable nature of traditional MRI machines that rely on superconducting magnets and liquid helium.
How Chipiron is building installation ease and patient experience into its scaling mission.
Why Chipiron’s lightweight MRI technology isn’t designed to compete with old-school machines.
Longevity movement backers.
Why it’s okay to chase M&A as an exit strategy, especially in the medical industry.
Equity will be back Friday with our weekly news roundup, so stay tuned.
Equity is TechCrunch’s flagship podcast, produced by Theresa Loconsolo, and posts every Wednesday and Friday.
