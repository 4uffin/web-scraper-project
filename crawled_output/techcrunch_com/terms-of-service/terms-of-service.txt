IMPORTANT NOTICE: THESE TERMS ARE SUBJECT TO A WAIVER OF CLASS ACTION RIGHTS, AS DETAILED IN THE “WAIVER OF CERTAIN RIGHTS” SECTION BELOW.
The following Terms of Service (these “Terms”) govern your access to and use of the web and mobile services operated by TechCrunch Media, LLC (“TechCrunch”), including techcrunch.com (collectively, the “Services”).
By continuing to use the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service and to use the Services in accordance with these Terms of Service, our Privacy Policy, and any additional terms and conditions that are referenced herein or that otherwise may apply to specific sections of the Services, or to products and services that we make available to you through the Services (all of which are deemed part of these Terms of Service). Accessing the Services, in any manner, whether automated or otherwise, constitutes use of the Services and your agreement to be bound by these Terms of Service. Your accessing of the Services for the limited and exclusive purpose of reviewing these Terms of Service does not constitute your “use” of the Services or agreement to be bound by these Terms of Service unless you further access or use the Services.
BY CONTINUING TO USE THE SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO ABIDE BY THESE TERMS, AND IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU REVIEW THESE TERMS CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE SERVICES.

We will not knowingly accept any advertising for real estate which is in violation of the law.

To complain of discrimination call the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development at 800-669-9777.

Our Services may permit users to post, and search for, job openings. We do not knowingly accept listings regarding employment that are not for bona fide job opportunities.

Restrictions
The Services is intended for use only by residents of the United States over the age of 13. It may not comply with legal requirements of foreign countries. Other countries may have laws and regulatory requirements that differ from those in the U.S. By using this Services, you agree to the transfer and processing of any personal information you provide to the U.S. as set forth in the Privacy Policy under the laws of the United States and the State of New York, rather than under the law of your home country.
Miscellaneous
This agreement constitutes the entire agreement between us and you with respect to the subject matter contained in this agreement and supersedes all previous and contemporaneous agreements, proposals and communications, written oral. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use the products or services of a third party that are provided through the Services. In the event of any conflict between any such third-party terms and conditions and these Terms of Service, these Terms of Service will govern. This agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law. The failure of TechCrunch to enforce any provision(s) of these Terms or respond to a breach by any party shall in no way waive TechCrunch’s right to subsequently enforce any of these Terms or respond to any breaches.
This agreement is personal to you and you may not assign it or any associated rights hereunder to anyone. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null and void. If any provision of this agreement is found to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision will be deemed severable from this agreement and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. These Terms of Service are not intended to benefit any third party, and do not create any third-party beneficiaries. Accordingly, these Terms of Service may only be invoked or enforced by you or us. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action that you may have arising out of or related to use of the Services or these Terms of Service must be filed by you within one year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. The term “including” in these Terms will be interpreted broadly and will mean “including, without limitation.” Titles are for convenience only and will not be considered when interpreting these Terms.
