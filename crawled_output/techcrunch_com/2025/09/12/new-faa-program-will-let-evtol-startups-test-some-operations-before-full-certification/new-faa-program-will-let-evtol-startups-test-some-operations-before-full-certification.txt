New FAA program will let eVTOL startups test some operations before full certification
Sean O'Kane
9:33 AM PDT · September 12, 2025
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has announced a new pilot program that will let electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) startups test some operations before they receive full regulatory certification.
It’s a potentially big change for these companies, as they’ve spent the last few years performing limited test flights of their aircraft while working toward FAA approval. But the program has its limits.
Companies will have to partner with state, local, tribal, or territorial governments to apply to the program. The FAA says it will approve at least five projects that can run for up to three years, covering short-range air taxis, longer-range fixed wing flights, cargo hauling, logistics and supply for emergency or medical purposes, and “increasing automation safety.”
The FAA is seeking applicants “who can deliver successful outcomes by working cooperatively with a range of entities, which will accelerate these projects consistent with the high safety standards that the public expects from the aviation industry,” according to the official solicitation paperwork.
“These projects, once successful, are expected to deliver substantial data and lessons learned to inform the broader regulatory framework that will support and oversee the AAM [advanced air mobility] sector,” the agency writes.
So far on Friday, Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation have announced that they plan to apply to the pilot program. Neither company has said which government entity they plan to apply with, though Archer noted it will work with existing partner (and investor) United Airlines. Applications are due on December 11, 2025, and the pilots might begin as soon as 2026.
