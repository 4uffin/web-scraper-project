8:00 AM PDT · September 12, 2025
The countdown is on: The application to host a Side Event at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 closes tonight at 11:59 p.m. PT.
If you’ve been considering a way to amplify your brand during the week’s tech epicenter, now is the time to lock it in.

With 10,000+ Disrupt attendees in San Francisco — plus the global spotlight of TechCrunch promotion — your event won’t just happen. It will resonate.
