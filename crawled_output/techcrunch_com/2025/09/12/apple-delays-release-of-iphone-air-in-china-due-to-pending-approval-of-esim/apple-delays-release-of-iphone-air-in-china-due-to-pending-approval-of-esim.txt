Apple delays release of iPhone Air in China due to pending approval of eSIM
Apple is set to release its upcoming iPhone 17 series on September 19 in most countries across the world. However, the eSIM-only iPhone Air’s release is being delayed in China, likely due to regulatory issues around the approval of the embedded SIM.
Apple’s website notes that all three Chinese state-owned network providers — China Mobile, China Telecom, and China Unicom — will offer eSIM support for the iPhone Air but says the timing of the release will be subject to regulatory approval. Preorders for the other new phones in the lineup start on Friday.
According to South China Morning Post, Apple told local media that it was working with regulatory authorities to bring the iPhone Air to China “as soon as possible.” The report referred to a post by China Mobile on social network Weibo that said the network has enabled eSIM services for mobile phones, though a launch date was not mentioned.
China Telecom posted on RedNote about launching its own eSIM service on September 19, when the iPhone 17 line is supposed to be released. However, the post has since been removed, SCMP noted.
Apple did not immediately return a request for comment.
