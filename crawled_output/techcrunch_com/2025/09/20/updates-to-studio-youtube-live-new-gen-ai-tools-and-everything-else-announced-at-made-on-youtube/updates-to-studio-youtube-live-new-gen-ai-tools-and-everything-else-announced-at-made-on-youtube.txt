Updates to Studio, YouTube Live, new gen AI tools, and everything else announced at Made on YouTube
Karyne Levy
8:00 AM PDT · September 20, 2025
At its annual Made on YouTube event this week, YouTube unveiled tons of new updates, features, and tools geared toward creators, including updates to YouTube Live, new ways to monetize, and more.
Studio updates include “likeness” detection and lip-synced dubs, and the company is offering new AI tools for podcasters to help promote their shows.
Here’s everything announced at Made on YouTube.
A new Studio

The company showed off new and updated tools to Studio, which creators use to manage their channels and track analytics. Updates include an inspiration tab, title A/B testing features, auto dubbing, and more.
What caught our attention is the “likeness”-detection feature, which was announced last year and made available to a few creators; it’s now in open beta. People will be able to detect, manage, and flag for removal any unauthorized videos using their facial likeness.
An AI-powered Ask Studio can guide users and answer questions about their account, and creators will be able to collaborate with up to five other people on one video, which is available to the audiences of all the participating video makers.
YouTube Live

YouTube gave Live, its livestreaming platform, some updates as well, like letting creators play minigames to entertain viewers, broadcasting simultaneously in both horizontal and vertical formats, providing AI-powered highlights, reacting to live events, using a new ad format, and more.

The AI-powered highlights automatically select the best moments from a livestream to turn them into shareable Shorts, and a new ad format — called “side-by-side” — runs adjacent to the main content, similar to a split-screen display, rather than interrupting the stream.
New tools for Shorts
YouTube is bringing a custom version of Veo 3, Google’s text-to-video generative AI model, to Shorts, as well as a new remixing tool, an “Edit with AI” feature, and more.
With Veo 3 Fast, as the custom version is called, creators can apply motion from a video to an image, add different styles to their videos, and insert objects into the video with a simple text prompt. Creators can also transform the dialogue from eligible videos into catchy soundtracks for other Shorts using Google’s AI music model, Lyria 2.
YouTube Music
YouTube Music got some updates as well, designed to deepen engagement between creators and their fans.
These include a countdown timer for new releases and a chance to offer fans “thank you” videos, and the company is testing a pilot program for U.S. listeners that will allow them to access exclusive merchandise drops from artists.

AI for podcasters
Video podcast creators in the U.S. will be able to create clips more easily with AI suggestions, according to YouTube. And a new feature rolling out next year will offer a way to turn audio podcasts into video podcasts
New monetization features
YouTube is giving creators new ways to monetize, with brand deals and through the YouTube Shopping program, which lets creators earn money by featuring and tagging products in their content. YouTube will also now allow creators to swap out brand sponsorships in long-form videos.
Creators can also take advantage of auto timestamps for product tags, auto tagging for eligible items mentioned in videos, and a new brand link feature for Shorts. An AI-powered system will help identify the optimal moment a product is mentioned and automatically display the product tag at that time.
Shorts creators will soon be able to add a link to a brand’s site specifically for brand deals, and YouTube will proactively suggest creators who may be a good fit for brands in its creator partnerships hub.
