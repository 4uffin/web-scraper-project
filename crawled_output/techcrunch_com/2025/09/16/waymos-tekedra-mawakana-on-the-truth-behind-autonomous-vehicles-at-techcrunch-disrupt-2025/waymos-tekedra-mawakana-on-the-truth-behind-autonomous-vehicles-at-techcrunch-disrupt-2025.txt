Waymo’s Tekedra Mawakana on Scaling Self-Driving Beyond the Hype
TechCrunch Events
10:35 AM PDT · September 16, 2025
Autonomous vehicles have long been touted as “just around the corner,” but the reality of bringing self-driving cars to the streets is far from simple. At TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 — October 27–29 at Moscone West in San Francisco — Waymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana joins the Disrupt Stage
for a wide-ranging conversation on the true state of AVs and where the industry goes from here.
Inside the self-driving reality check
While headlines often highlight crashes, controversies, or overblown promises, Mawakana has spent years navigating the real-world path to autonomous mobility. At Disrupt, she’ll dig into what it actually takes to scale AV deployment — from rider safety and public trust to regulation, operations, and competitive pressure from Tesla and others.
This session isn’t about vague timelines or flashy demos. It’s about what’s working, what still needs work, and what it means to bring autonomy to life at scale. Whether you’re a founder, investor, or simply curious about the road ahead, you won’t want to miss it.
