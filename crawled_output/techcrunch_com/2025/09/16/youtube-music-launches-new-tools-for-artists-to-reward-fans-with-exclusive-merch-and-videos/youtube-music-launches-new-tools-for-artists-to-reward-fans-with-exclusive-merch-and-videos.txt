YouTube Music launches new tools for artists to reward fans with exclusive merch and videos

7:30 AM PDT · September 16, 2025
During YouTube’s Made On event on Tuesday, the company announced three features coming to YouTube Music, which are designed to deepen the connection between artists and their dedicated fans.
One of the new features allows users to initiate a countdown for upcoming releases and to pre-save their favorite tracks or albums in advance. The countdown timer will be displayed on the album detail page, artist profile, and album shelf. Set to launch later this year, the feature aims to create buzz leading up to the release date and appears to be similar to a feature on Spotify called Countdown Pages.

Starting early next year, artists will be able to engage with their most loyal fans by offering exclusive “thank you” videos, similar to those delivered during rival Spotify’s year-end Wrapped experience, plus behind-the-scenes clips, and other content.
This approach aims to reward top supporters and build a more personal connection between fans and their favorite artists, the company says.

Additionally, YouTube Music is testing a pilot program for U.S. listeners that will allow them to access exclusive merchandise drops from artists. Spotify, too, has been teasing a program for “super fans” that would potentially include similar features.

Today’s announcement follows YouTube Music’s recent rollout of new features last month, marking the music streaming platform’s 10th anniversary. This included collaborative playlists that combine the overlapping interests of multiple users, badges, and the ability to comment directly on albums and playlists.
