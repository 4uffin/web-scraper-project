Figure reaches $39B valuation in latest funding round
Humanoid robotics company Figure raised its largest round of funding yet, a sign of growing investor interest in robots designed to work alongside humans in warehouses, factories, and other settings.
The company, based in San Jose, California, announced on Tuesday that it raised a Series C funding round that values it at $39 billion. The round, which “exceeded $1 billion,” said Figure, was led by Parkway Venture Capital with participation from Brookfield Asset Management, Nvidia, and Intel Capital, among others.
Figure said the funding will be used to scale the company’s fleet of humanoid robots, build the necessary infrastructure to accelerate robot training, and launch advanced data collection efforts.
The company has raised nearly $2 billion in funding since its 2022 founding.
Earlier this year, Figure CEO Brett Adcock claimed that Figure was the most “sought-after” stock on the private market. But the company has also been sending cease-and-desist letters to multiple secondary stock market brokers, telling TechCrunch in April that it sends such letters when a broker isn’t authorized to sell its shares.
TechCrunch has reached out to Figure for comment.
