Google rolls out new Windows desktop app with Spotlight-like search tool
Aisha Malik
11:24 AM PDT · September 16, 2025
Google announced on Tuesday that it’s launching a new experimental app for Windows that’s designed to help people find what they need faster. The app will allow people to use an Alt + Space shortcut to instantly search for information from their computer files, installed apps, Google Drive files, and the web.
The search bar works similar to Mac’s Spotlight search, which lets users quickly find anything on their device and on the web.
The new app is available via Search Labs, Google’s experimental program that lets people test early-stage features and provide feedback before they are broadly released.
Google notes that the app has Google Lens built in, which means people can select and search anything on their screen to do things like quickly translate images or text, get help with math homework, and more. Users can also get deeper responses in Google’s AI Mode, its search feature that lets users ask complex, multipart questions via an AI interface.
Users have the option to switch between all results, AI mode, images, shopping, videos, and more. There’s also the option to switch to dark mode.
The new app is available in English and for users in the U.S. A PC with Windows 10 or up is required.
