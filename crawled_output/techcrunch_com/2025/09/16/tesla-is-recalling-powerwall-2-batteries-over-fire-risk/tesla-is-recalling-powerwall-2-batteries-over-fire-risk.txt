Tesla is recalling Powerwall 2 batteries over fire risk
Tesla is recalling Powerwall 2 home batteries in Australia after the company received reports of fires that led to “minor property damage,” according to the Australia Competition and Consumer Commission.
The recall affects an unspecified number of Powerwall 2 units made in the U.S. and sold between November 2020 and June 2022. The cells were made by an unnamed third-party supplier. Despite the fires, no injuries have been reported, the ACCC said in a recall notice.
The Powerwall 2 contains 14 kWh of lithium ion batteries, and its usually installed alongside solar panels to store excess power generated during the day.
Customers can also enroll their batteries in a virtual power plant to support the grid in times of heavy load. Enrolling extends the warranty to up to 15 years and gives customers access to time-of-use rates that will help reduce energy bills, Tesla says.
Homeowners will be notified in the Tesla app if their Powerwall is part of the recall, and the company is in the process of discharging the batteries to reduce the risk of fire. Recalled batteries will be replaced free of charge, and the company “will consider compensation for lost energy savings … on a case-by-case basis,” the ACCC said.
