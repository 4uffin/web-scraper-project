Google now lets you share your custom Gemini AI assistants known as Gems
Google is making it possible to now share your Gemini Gems — custom AI assistants and experts designed for specific tasks — the company announced on Thursday. The feature launched last year, initially as part of the Gemini Advanced paid subscription, allowing users to write instructions to create an AI chatbot for different scenarios. For instance, Google launched with premade Gems like a learning coach, a brainstorming assistant, a career guide, a writing editor, and a coding partner.
Now Google says you’ll be able to share your Gems with friends, family, or co-workers as easily as you can share a file from Google Drive.
This would make Gems more accessible to more people, as not everyone uses the advanced customization feature. It could also help prevent people from building the same Gems as others. For instance, if multiple co-workers were using a similar type of custom Gemini assistant, they could just share the same resource instead of each making their own version that could have slight inconsistencies between them.
Google suggests Gem sharing could also be useful for people working on family vacation plans and guides, meal planners, or collaborative writing projects.

To share a Gem, you’ll open the Gem manager on the web app and click the “Share” icon next to any Gem you’ve created. Also similar to Google Drive, you can control who can view and use your Gems and who’s allowed to edit them.
After first rolling out to Gemini Advanced, Gemini Business, and Gemini Enterprise subscribers in over 150 countries, Google announced in March that Gems were now available to everyone and could support file uploads.
