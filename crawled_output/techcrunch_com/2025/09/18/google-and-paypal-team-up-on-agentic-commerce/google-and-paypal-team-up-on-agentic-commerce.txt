Google and PayPal team up on agentic commerce
PayPal announced on Wednesday a new multi-year partnership with Google that will see the payments giant using Google’s AI technology to create new AI-powered shopping experiences. PayPal’s solutions, meanwhile, will be integrated across Google’s products, and PayPal will work with Google Cloud on hosting and improving its technology infrastructure.
The companies did not detail what specific types of agentic shopping experiences they would work together to create but said Google would contribute its AI technology and expertise, and PayPal would leverage its global payment infrastructure, personalization, and identity solutions.
In addition, both companies will join others to advocate for the adoption of Google’s new Agent Payments Protocol, announced on Tuesday. This open protocol is meant to enable purchases that are initiated by AI agents and has already been backed by over 60 merchants and financial institutions.
As part of the deal, PayPal will be listed as a key payment provider for card payments in areas like Google Cloud, Google Ads, and Google Play. Other products being integrated by Google include PayPal’s branded checkout, Hyperwallet payouts service, and PayPal Payouts service.
