From scrappy challenger to IPO: Chris Britt brings Chime’s playbook to TechCrunch Disrupt 2025
TechCrunch Events
7:30 AM PDT · September 18, 2025
TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 takes place October 27–29 at Moscone West in San Francisco, bringing together 10,000+ startup and VC leaders to shape the future of tech. Few embody what it means to build with discipline in a tough market better than Chris Britt, co-founder and CEO of Chime. What began as a scrappy fintech challenger has grown into one of the rare companies to go public in today’s challenging environment. In his session, “Building a Company that Lasts,” Britt will share the lessons behind Chime’s rise — from weathering market headwinds to making the leap from private to public when so few manage it.

A career built on resilience and impact
Britt brings a deep track record to the stage. Before Chime, he served in senior roles at Green Dot, Visa, and Comscore. In 2024, he was named Tulane Distinguished Entrepreneur of the Year, and he continues to give back as a member of Tulane’s board of directors, a board member of CoachArt, and founder of the Chime Scholars Foundation, which pledges 1% of Chime equity to fund higher education for aspiring students.
