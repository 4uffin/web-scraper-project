Building the future of Open AI with Thomas Wolf at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025
TechCrunch Events
7:00 AM PDT · September 18, 2025
AI is moving fast — but who decides how it’s built, shared, and scaled? At TechCrunch Disrupt 2025, happening October 27-29 at San Francisco’s Moscone West, we’re diving in with Thomas Wolf, co-founder and chief science officer of Hugging Face, for a session on what it takes to make cutting-edge research and models that are truly open and accessible. Catch him on the AI Stage, along with thousands of other like-minded tech leaders and innovators.
Why you can’t miss this session
The future of AI won’t just be defined by closed labs and Big Tech budgets — it will be written in open source repos, global research collaborations, and moonshot experiments that anyone can build on. Wolf brings a rare perspective on how to bridge research, community, and real-world applications in ways that shape both the technology and the ecosystem around it.
Whether you’re a founder, developer, or investor, this session offers a clear view of where AI is headed — and how openness can drive the next wave of breakthroughs.
The architect behind today’s AI breakthroughs
Wolf has been at the center of some of the most important advances in AI. At Hugging Face, he helped launch the Transformers and Datasets libraries, led the BigScience Workshop on large language models that produced BLOOM, and has championed open science across industry and academia. He’s also co-author of “Natural Language Processing with Transformers” and “The Ultra-Scale Playbook,” resources shaping how the next generation of AI practitioners learn and build.
