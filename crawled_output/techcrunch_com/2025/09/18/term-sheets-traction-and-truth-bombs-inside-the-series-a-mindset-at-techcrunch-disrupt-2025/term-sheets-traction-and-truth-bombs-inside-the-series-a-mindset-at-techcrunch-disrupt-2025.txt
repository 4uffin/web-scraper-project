At TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 — taking place October 27–29 at Moscone West in San Francisco — get the unfiltered perspective on landing a Series A in today’s market. No smoke, no mirrors, just straight talk from the people signing the checks.
How to raise a Series A in 2026
This Builders Stage session brings together Katie Stanton (Moxxie Ventures), Thomas Krane (Insight Partners), and Sangeen Zeb (GV). They’ve seen thousands of decks, led major rounds, and helped steer startups from scrappy beginnings to breakout scale.
You’ll hear what actually moves a pitch from “maybe” to “we’re in,” including the metrics that matter, how to tell your growth story, and what causes investors to walk away.

Thomas Krane: Managing director at Insight Partners, Krane has backed major software and cybersecurity names like JFrog and SentinelOne, and knows how to identify scalable traction.
Sangeen Zeb: General partner at GV, Zeb focuses on enterprise and AI startups, serving on boards, including for Vercel and Harvey, while leading investments in some of tech’s most talked-about growth stories.
