Apple debuts the $999 ultra-thin iPhone Air
Lauren Forristal
11:26 AM PDT · September 9, 2025
Move over, iPhone Plus, here comes your super-slim replacement: the iPhone Air.
During Apple’s hardware event on Tuesday, the company unveiled the iPhone Air, its thinnest and lightest model to date. This replaces the Plus model in the company’s 2025 lineup, following the underperformance of the iPhone 16 Plus last year, based on data from research firm DSCC.
The star of today’s event draws inspiration from Apple’s MacBook Air strategy, which debuted in 2008 as the thinnest laptop available, positioned between the more affordable MacBook and the higher-quality MacBook Pro.
Now Apple is applying the “Air” concept to the iPhone, emphasizing thinness and lightness as the main selling points.
The “airiness” feel is thanks to its titanium frame, and it measures at just 5.6 millimeters thick. This makes it about 0.08 inches (or slightly over 2 mm) thinner than current iPhones and thinner than Samsung’s 5.8 mm Galaxy S25 Edge. For a better idea of how thin it is, think about four stacked dimes, which total about 5.4 mm.
The phone features a large 6.6-inch display, sporting the same 120 Hz ProMotion setup found on the Pro models. It runs on the A19 Pro chip, also like the new Pro and Pro Max models, providing a performance boost over the base iPhone 17 model.

Another interesting detail is that it’s an e-SIM-only device. This helps keep the phone looking sleek since there’s no need for a physical SIM card slot. It also offers more security than regular SIM cards, as they can’t be easily removed from a lost or stolen phone.

When rumors began circulating about the iPhone Air, many concerns centered on battery life and the absence of two rear cameras, like what the Plus model has. However, during the event, Apple introduced its new 48-megapixel fusion camera system, which functions as multiple advanced cameras in one.
Despite being thinner, the iPhone Air offers all-day battery life. Additionally, with the iOS 26 update, users will gain the Adaptive Power Mode feature, which utilizes Apple Intelligence to make intelligent adjustments throughout the day, thereby helping to extend battery life.
Still, Apple appeared to acknowledge the battery concerns by unveiling a new line of accessories exclusive to the Air, including a slim MagSafe battery that is compact enough to fit in your pocket. When using this additional battery, users can enjoy up to 40 hours of video playback.
Additionally, two custom cases are available for the iPhone Air: One is a translucent case that is just 1 mm thick and comes in frost and shadow colors, while the other is a lightweight bumper available in four matching colors. Notably, the iPhone Air can also be paired with a new cross-body strap.
As for the color options, the iPhone Air is available in space black, cloud white, light gold, and sky blue.
Apple joins the “thinness wars,” but will it appeal to the general public?

Rumors of a new, ultra-thin iPhone, potentially named “Air,” first surfaced in 2024 from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, who recently argued that the thinner design will set the standard for all future iPhone models, similar to how the MacBook Air influenced Apple’s laptop lineup.
When the MacBook Air first came out, it was praised for being ultraportable at a time when most laptops were heavy and bulky. However, it also received a lot of criticism for being too expensive and having some shortcomings, such as poor connectivity and a slow, small hard drive.
Still, the original model set the stage for the 2010 version, which was revamped with improved processors and a more affordable starting price of $999. Since then, the MacBook Air has been Apple’s top seller for more than a decade.
With that being said, anyone thinking about buying the iPhone Air should consider whether holding off for later versions with upgrades and better features is a smarter move. Or, for those die-hard Apple fans, maybe it’s worth owning the original model for bragging rights.
Additionally, the slimmer phone could pave the way for a future iPhone that folds, a concept that has been rumored and is predicted to launch around the same time next year. A foldable device would help Apple compete with Samsung and Google, while also helping it regain market share in China, where it has been struggling recently.
