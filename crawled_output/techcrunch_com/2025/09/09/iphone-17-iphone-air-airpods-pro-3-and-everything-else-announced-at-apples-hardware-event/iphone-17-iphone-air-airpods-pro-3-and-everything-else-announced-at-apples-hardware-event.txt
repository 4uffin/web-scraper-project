iPhone 17, iPhone Air, AirPods Pro 3, and everything else announced at Apple’s hardware event
Lauren Forristal
9:32 AM PDT · September 14, 2025
Apple hosted its new hardware event today, releasing its iPhone 17 lineup, along with updates for the Apple Watch and AirPods. For the iPhone 17 models, updates included larger screens and an improved camera system, as well as the introduction of an ultra-thin iPhone Air that replaces the Plus model.
And the company may be announcing more new hardware soon, with Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reporting that a new iPad Pro, an updated Vision Pro, updated AirTags, a new Apple TV, a new HomePod mini, and updated MacBooks are coming in either 2025 or the first half of 2026.

The iPhone 17 received a makeover to align more closely with the Pro models. It features a slightly larger 6.3-inch screen, which is an increase of 0.2 inches compared to the iPhone 16. It also has a 120 Hz display, a substantial upgrade from the current 60 Hz. The phone also has a 48-megapixel ultrawide camera.
It comes in new colors: lavender, mist blue, black, white, and sage.
The Pro’s upgrades are mainly on the back of the phone. The three rear cameras are now arranged in a rectangular bar that extends from one edge of the device to the other. The flash, light sensor, and microphone are positioned far to the right side. Where the MagSafe charger is, the Apple logo is centered for aesthetic reasons.
Notably, the iPhone 17 Pro switched materials, replacing the titanium band around the screen with aluminum.
The iPhone 17 starts at $799 and has a base storage of 256GB. In contrast, the iPhone 16 started at $699 for 128GB. The Pro model costs $1,099, and the Pro Max is $1,199.

While the event’s primary focus was on the iPhones, Apple announced new phone cases as a bonus. Called “TechWoven” cases, these feature a higher-quality woven material compared to the discontinued “FineWoven” line of fabric cases Apple released in 2023.
Missing from the keynote was any mention of an AI-enhanced Siri, which puts Apple way behind Google and its competitors.

The biggest announcement at the event was the debut of Apple’s slimmest phone ever, the iPhone Air, which replaces the iPhone Plus.
This device has a profile thickness of 5.6 mm, making it about 0.08 inches thinner than current iPhones. It also features a 6.6-inch screen and a 120 Hz ProMotion display. The device is eSIM only, which helps the product maintain its sleek design.
This move appears to be Apple’s response to the trend of slimmer smartphones, following in the footsteps of other companies like Samsung and Huawei. The iPhone Air could potentially outshine the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge, which measures 5.8 mm thick. Additionally, it may pave the way for Apple’s long-rumored foldable phone, predicted to launch in September 2026.
The device is priced at $999 and will be available in black, white, sky blue, and light gold.
Apple Watch Series 11, Ultra 3, and SE 3

After a two-year wait, Apple announced the Apple Watch Ultra 3, which includes faster charging speeds, 5G support, and satellite connectivity. The watch also features a larger display.
However, one of the most exciting upgrades for both the Ultra 3 and Series 11 is the incorporation of blood pressure-monitoring capabilities. This feature notifies users if their blood pressure levels are too high or too low.
The third-generation Apple Watch SE, meanwhile, didn’t receive major updates, aside from an always-on display, thanks to a faster S10 chip.
Prices for the watches are $249 for the Apple Watch SE 3, $399 for the Series 11, and $799 for the Ultra 3.
AirPods Pro 3

After the release of the AirPods Pro 2 in 2022, it’s about time for an upgrade. The AirPods Pro 3, priced at $249, features smaller earbuds, improved audio, and a new heart-rate-sensing feature. It also features live translation technology, powered by Apple Intelligence, to help users translate foreign languages in real time.
