New emojis will include Bigfoot, orca whale, treasure chest, and more
Amanda Silberling

The Unicode Consortium has confirmed its next slate of emojis, coming in the next year to eager thumbs near you.
Yes, there is indeed a nonprofit organization that creates standardized language across devices from a wide range of hardware makers — that’s why if you send your friend a flamenco dancer emoji from your iPhone, they’ll be able to see that suave dancer in a red dress on their Android. And that same organization gets the final say on what new emojis come to your device.
The new emojis include a trombone, a treasure chest, an bulging-eyes face, a fight cloud, an apple core, an orca whale, a gender-neutral ballet dancer, a landslide, and Bigfoot.
Now you can illustrate even the most bizarre of situations — we’ve all had that very relatable moment when you’re taking a long trek up a mountain and suddenly, you find a buried treasure, at which your eyes bulge out and you suddenly notice a clearing where orcas are jumping in the distance, while ballerinas dance to trombone music. Also, you’ve just eaten a red apple.
The next group of emojis will also support various skin tone options for emojis that show more than one person, like the emojis of people with bunny ears dancing and people wrestling.
