Don’t miss this rare opportunity to boost your brand
Still debating? Here’s what you’ll miss if you don’t host:
Influence where it matters: Shape the conversations happening around Disrupt 2025 instead of just attending them.
Direct deal flow: Get face time with founders and investors outside of the crowded expo floor.
Audience leverage: Use your exclusive host discount codes to draw your own network into Disrupt and your event.
Competitive edge: While others blend into the attendee crowd, you’ll stand out as a convener of ideas and people.
Amplification with credibility: Having your event listed alongside Disrupt programming and the TechCrunch audience gives it weight — and we’ll help signal-boost while you fill the room with your targets.
Hurry before applications close tonight
Applying is easy. Click here to apply for your compelling Side Event and make waves in the tech scene before, during, and after the main event.
