TechCrunch’s Equity podcast is on video, starting today
Theresa Loconsolo
11:00 AM PDT · September 19, 2025
We get it, it seems like every single podcast you love is now on video. And guess what … so is TechCrunch’s flagship podcast Equity. The team just launched its first video episode today, with many more to come. As we enter the lead-up to Disrupt, there’s no better time to dust off your feed, resubscribe, or just embrace the trend and see what you think of the video version of our longest-running podcast.
For those not in the know, Equity is our twice-weekly podcast that alternates between two formats: Every Wednesday, senior reporter Rebecca Bellan interviews major players in the tech and startup world. In case you missed it, she’s recently sat down with Wiz co-founder Ami Luttwak, “Empire of AI” author Karen Hao, and Mark Cuban.
Then on Fridays, editors and writers Kirsten Korosec, Maxwell Zeff, and Anthony Ha get together to process everything that just happened, from the biggest deals to surprise reveals, bringing their unique perspective to the news you know and the news you missed. Some recent highlights include an exploration of the battle over your browser, what’s behind Nvidia’s wild AI infrastructure spending predictions, and the growth of IRL brain rot.
With all that said, you can watch our debut Friday episode below, or opt to follow Equity in your preferred platform. We have plenty of options available: Spotify, Apple Podcasts, Overcast, YouTube, X, and Threads.
