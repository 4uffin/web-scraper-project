Jaguar Land Rover says data stolen in disruptive cyberattack
Jaguar Land Rover said on Wednesday that an unspecified amount of data was stolen during a cyberattack that has brought vehicle assembly lines to a standstill.
In a statement on Wednesday, the U.K.-based maker of Land Rover and Range Rover vehicles said it was aware that “some data” was taken in the incident.
Companies that operate in the U.K. are obligated to notify the Information Commissioner’s Office within three days of discovering a data breach. It’s not immediately clear if the data relates to the company, its employees, or its customers.
Jaguar Land Rover disclosed the cyberattack on September 2, saying the incident forced the company to shut down its systems, which “severely disrupted” its production line and sales operations. The incident is also affecting the company’s supply chains, including vehicle repairs.
The carmaker is one of the largest employers in the U.K., with more than 33,000 staff. Per one newspaper report, U.K. government officials are said to be concerned about the economic fallout of the breach, and a recovery is expected to take weeks, not days.
