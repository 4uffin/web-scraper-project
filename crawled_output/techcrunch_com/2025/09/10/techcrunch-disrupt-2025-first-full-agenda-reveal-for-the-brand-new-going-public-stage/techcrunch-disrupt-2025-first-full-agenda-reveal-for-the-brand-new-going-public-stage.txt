How Long Should a Startup Stay Private?
David George, general partner, Andreessen Horowitz
Startups today can grow to huge valuations, cash out their employees, and stay private longer than those of previous eras. But that also means that late-stage startups are facing a whole new set of rules. George unpacks the shifting VC landscape, what the next generation of scaled startups needs to know, and how capital is being deployed in an era of tighter money and higher expectations. From IPO windows to secondary markets to the evolving role of growth investors, this fireside chat goes deep on what it really takes to build enduring companies in today’s market — and what’s coming next.

Jane Alexander, partner, CapitalG; Vanessa Larco, co-founder, Premise; and Nirav Tolia, CEO, Nextdoor
AI is rewriting the playbook for how startups reach and win customers — and late-stage companies are feeling the pressure to adapt fast. In this panel, two top VCs and a seasoned founder break down how AI is transforming go-to-market strategies, from sales and marketing to customer success. We’ll get into what’s working, what’s hype, and how to build AI into your GTM engine without losing focus.

Building a Company That Lasts
Chris Britt, co-founder and CEO, Chime
Chris Britt knows how to build a company that withstands headwinds and seizes rare opportunities. As co-founder and CEO of Chime, he’s led the fintech from scrappy challenger to one of the few to go public in today’s tough market. In this conversation, Britt will share what it takes to scale with discipline, stay resilient through market shifts, and make the leap from private to public when so few manage it.
Everything You Need to Know Before an Exit
Jai Das, co-founder, president, and partner, Sapphire Ventures; and Roseanne Wincek, co-founder and managing director, Renegade Partners
Go public, get acquired, or double down and stay private? In today’s unpredictable market, founders need to think about exit strategy earlier — and more strategically — than ever. This panel brings together two top VCs and a seasoned CFO to unpack how to set your company up for every option. We’ll talk timing, metrics that matter, investor expectations, and what it really takes to navigate M&A and IPO prep, or just keep building through the storm.
