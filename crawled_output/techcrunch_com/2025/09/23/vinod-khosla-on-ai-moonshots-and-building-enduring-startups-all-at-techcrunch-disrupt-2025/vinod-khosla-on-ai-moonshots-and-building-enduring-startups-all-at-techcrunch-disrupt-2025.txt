Vinod Khosla on AI, moonshots, and building enduring startups — all at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025
TechCrunch Events
8:00 AM PDT · September 23, 2025
Few investors speak as bluntly — or think as big — as Vinod Khosla. The Khosla Ventures’ founder has never shied away from calling out hype, doubling down on ambitious bets, and pushing founders to look beyond incremental progress.
This October at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025, happening October 27-29 at San Francisco’s Moscone West, Khosla will return to the Disrupt Stage for a fireside chat that promises insight, provocation, and inspiration. In a session overflowing with experience and hard-won lessons, he will share his unvarnished take on the world 15 years from now — a future he believes will be defined by unprecedented abundance, massive job displacement, and transformational change across every sector. This is advice entrepreneurs need to hear — not just what they want to hear — to build enduring companies in turbulent times.
Seats at the Disrupt Stage will fill fast — don’t get stuck outside. This is a can’t-miss session, and you can still lock in your savings. Register by September 26 at 11:59 p.m. PT to save up to $668.
Vinod Khosla returns to Disrupt with candid insights and bold predictions
At last year’s Disrupt, Khosla’s session drew a packed audience and sparked headlines, reflecting his rare ability to combine candid critique with visionary thinking. From evaluating ideas to navigating real-world challenges, Khosla will leave founders and investors alike with actionable insights that can’t be found in a pitch deck or a startup handbook.
