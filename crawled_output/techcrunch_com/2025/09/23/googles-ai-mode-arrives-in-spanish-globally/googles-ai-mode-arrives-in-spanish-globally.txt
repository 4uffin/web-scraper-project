Google’s AI Mode arrives in Spanish globally
Sarah Perez
2:18 PM PDT · September 23, 2025
Google Search is bringing its AI Mode feature — its AI-powered search experience — to Spanish-speaking users, the company announced on Tuesday. This expansion will introduce Google’s conversational search interface to a broader market, allowing users to ask questions using natural language queries, engage in back-and-forth conversations, upload images, dig deeper on complex topics, and more.
The Spanish-language rollout comes on the heels of Google’s major AI Mode expansion in August, when the company released the feature to 180 more countries worldwide. Previously, it had only been available in the U.S., U.K., and India. During that August rollout, Google also introduced advanced AI capabilities to its Google AI Ultra subscribers, allowing them to request restaurant reservations in AI Mode. The company plans to introduce support for other types of appointments and event ticket purchases in the future.
Google has been rapidly rolling out AI across its products and services, often with multiple product announcements occurring simultaneously. For instance, the company announced Tuesday that it was bringing conversational photo editing to all Android users in the U.S. It also announced the same day that its more affordable Google AI Plus subscription plan, first introduced in Indonesia, is now arriving in 40 more countries. This expansion follows OpenAI’s recent launch of its ChatGPT’s Go plan, which launched in India in August and in Indonesia on Tuesday.
The ChatGPT Go plan is a mid-tier subscription option that sits between OpenAI’s free version and its premium $20-per-month ChatGPT Plus plan. Users get 10 times higher usage limits than the free plan for sending questions or prompts, generating images, and uploading files. According to OpenAI, the plan also allows ChatGPT to remember previous conversations better, enabling more personalized responses over time.
Google announced earlier this month that AI Mode also now supports Hindi, Indonesian, Japanese, Korean, and Brazilian Portuguese.
With so many products, users may find it hard to distinguish between different features and functionality, like the difference between Google’s AI Mode and its AI Overviews. The former is a separate, immersive, and conversational experience where users chat directly with Gemini AI. Meanwhile, AI Overviews simply offer a quick, AI-generated summary of information about your search query at the top of Google’s Search results.
