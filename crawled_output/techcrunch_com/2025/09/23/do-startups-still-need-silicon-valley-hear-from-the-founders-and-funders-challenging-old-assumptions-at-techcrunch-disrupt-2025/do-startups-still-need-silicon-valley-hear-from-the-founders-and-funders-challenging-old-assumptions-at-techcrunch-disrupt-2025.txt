Do startups still need Silicon Valley? Leaders at SignalFire, Lago, and Revolution debate at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025
TechCrunch Events
10:15 AM PDT · September 23, 2025
As the startup world descends on San Francisco for TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 — happening October 27–29 at Moscone West — one question looms large: Does building in Silicon Valley still give founders an edge? With 10,000+ startup and VC leaders gathering for this milestone Disrupt, the conversation around access, geography, and opportunity has never been more timely.
On the Builders Stage, Anh-Tho Chuong (Lago), David Hall (Revolution), and Tawni Nazario-Cranz (SignalFire) lead a must-attend session for anyone looking to scale smart in today’s startup landscape.
Register now to save up to $668 before the deadline on September 26 at 11:59 p.m. PT.
Why this conversation matters now
As distributed teams, regional hubs, and global fundraising become more normalized, founders are increasingly asking if their ZIP code actually gives them an edge. Does being in the Bay Area still open the right doors? Or has the playing field finally leveled?
This session brings together startup veterans and seasoned investors who’ve built and backed companies across the country — and well beyond it. They’ll dig into what access looks like in 2025, how remote collaboration has evolved post-pandemic, and where true opportunity lies for emerging founders.
Who’s taking the Builders Stage for this session
Anh-Tho Chuong is rethinking open source billing with Lago, a YC-backed platform trusted by AI leaders like Mistral and Together. From her time scaling Qonto to her early roles at Weebly and McKinsey, she’s no stranger to navigating growth across continents.
David Hall has spent the last decade proving that game-changing companies don’t have to come out of Silicon Valley. As managing partner at Revolution’s Rise of the Rest Seed Fund, he’s helped build a portfolio that spans the country — backing bold founders in places often overlooked by coastal VCs.
Tawni Nazario-Cranz, partner at SignalFire and former CHRO at Waymo, brings a people-first perspective to scaling organizations. She’s helped steer companies through rapid growth phases while shaping talent strategies that work far beyond the Valley.
The edge debate: Bay Area vs. everywhere else
Whether you’re building in a big city, a small town, or somewhere in between, this session will offer a fresh perspective on where startup success really comes from. Find out what still matters, what doesn’t, and how to build your network — no matter your location.
Catch this conversation live on the Builders Stage at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025, happening October 27–29 at Moscone West in San Francisco. Register now to save up to $668 before prices increase on September 26.
