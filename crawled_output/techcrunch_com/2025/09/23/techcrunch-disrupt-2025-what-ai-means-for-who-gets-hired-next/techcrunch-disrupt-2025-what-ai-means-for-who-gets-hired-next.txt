The future of work is no longer on the horizon — it’s being redefined in real time.
On the AI Stage at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025, Mercor co-founder and CEO Brendan Foody will break down how artificial intelligence is transforming not just how we work, but also who gets to work in the first place. From talent access to hiring pipelines to the rise of AI-augmented teams, it’s a conversation that could reshape the way you think about your next hire.

Redefining the global workforce
Backed by names like Peter Thiel and Jack Dorsey, Mercor has gone from $1 to $500 million in revenue run rate in just 17 months — a staggering pace that reflects how quickly AI is changing the labor landscape. Foody will share how his team is using AI to match companies with elite technical talent, what it takes to build a truly distributed hiring model, and why upskilling is becoming mission-critical in today’s global economy.
In his session, Foody will also explore how startups and enterprise leaders alike can harness AI to unlock new talent pools, eliminate bias in hiring, and build workforces equipped for what’s next — not just what’s now.
