StrictlyVC at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025: The full LP track agenda revealed
TechCrunch Events
7:30 AM PDT · September 23, 2025
StrictlyVC is back at TechCrunch Disrupt in October, bringing together the insiders who shape the venture capital landscape, this time with a sharper focus on the market’s biggest challenge: liquidity. In an era of extended exit timelines, slowed distributions, and increasingly selective LPs, the conversations behind closed doors matter more than ever.
Working with Cendana Capital, which has backed 80+ funds in its 15-year history, we are launching a new off-the-record LP track that offers an unfiltered look at where capital is flowing, how LP priorities are changing, and what GPs need to know to survive and thrive in this environment. If you raise, deploy, or manage capital, this is the room you want to be in.
TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 takes place on October 28 from 3 p.m. PT at San Francisco’s Moscone West. Join us for drinks and networking before the program begins. Attendance is limited to Investor Pass holders only — and every session is designed to arm you with strategies you can use immediately in today’s challenging fundraising climate while at the same time connecting you with the people you need to know.
Don’t miss this curated event built for strictly investors. Secure your Investor Pass now and save $668 before September 26 at 11:59 p.m. PT.

The Liquidity Reckoning: Navigating the New LP Landscapewith Lara Banks, Makena Capital; Matt Hodan, Lexington Partners; and Michael Kim, Cendana Capital

In this session, we’ll unpack how the liquidity drought is reshaping LP–GP relationships, fund pacing, and capital commitments. Expect candid discussion on where LPs see opportunity, where they’re pulling back, and how GPs can position themselves to weather the storm.

With fundraising timelines stretching and capital concentration intensifying, LPs are more selective than ever. What actually gets a GP noticed and funded in 2025’s competitive market?
