Google Photos users on Android can now edit their photos by talking to or texting the AI
Android users are now able to edit their photos with AI, Google announced on Tuesday. In Google Photos, users will be able to talk to the AI using natural language to describe how they want to edit their photo via either voice or text, Google says.
The feature is designed to make it easier to edit photos without having to understand which editing tools to use or where they can be found in the app.
The Gemini-powered feature was initially made available to those with the newly launched Pixel 10 devices in the U.S., introduced in August.

To get started, you can tap “Help me edit” in the editor, then describe how you want to change the photo. If you’re not sure where to start to make improvements, you can also use one of the provided Gemini suggestions or simply tell the AI to “make it better.”
The feature supports the usual types of edits, like lighting adjustments or removing distractions from the images, as well as more advanced edits, like removing objects in the background or restoring an old image. Plus, it can change photos to have fantastical AI elements added, for a bit of creativity.
As you continue to edit, Gemini will support follow-up requests to help you fine-tune your work further.
AI editing is currently available to users 18 and up in the U.S. in English.
