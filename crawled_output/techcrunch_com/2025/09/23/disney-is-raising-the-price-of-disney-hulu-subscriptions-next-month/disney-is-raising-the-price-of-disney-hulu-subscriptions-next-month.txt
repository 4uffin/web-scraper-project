Disney is raising the price of Disney+, Hulu subscriptions next month

Disney is raising the price of Disney+ and Hulu subscriptions once again. Starting October 21, many of the streaming services’ standalone plans and bundles will see price increases.
The Disney+ standalone plan with ads will increase by $2 to $11.99 per month, while the no-ads Disney+ Premium plan is increasing by $3 to $18.99 per month. The Disney+ Premium annual plan is increasing by $30 to $189.99 per year.
The Hulu standalone plan with ads is increasing from $9.99 per month to $11.99. However, the premium version of Hulu with no ads will remain at $18.99 per month. Additionally, the price of ESPN Select is increasing from $11.99 to $12.99 per month.
The Disney+ and Hulu with ads bundle subscription price is going up by $2 to $12.99, while the Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN Select bundle with ads is increasing by $3 to $19.99. The full list of price increases for Disney+ and Hulu bundle plans can be found on the company’s support page.
The timing of the price increases isn’t ideal, as Disney+ subscribers canceled their subscriptions in droves last week, protesting Disney’s decision to temporarily pull Jimmy Kimmel from its airwaves.
Disney+ launched in 2019 with a $6.99 monthly subscription, and has since followed other streaming services in gradually increasing its prices. The company’s last price hike was announced in October 2024, when the ad-free plan increased from $13.99 per month to $15.99, and the plan with ads increased from $7.99 per month to $9.99.
