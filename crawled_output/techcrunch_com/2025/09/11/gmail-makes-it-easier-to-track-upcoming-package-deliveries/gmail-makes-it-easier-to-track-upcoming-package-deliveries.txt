Gmail makes it easier to track upcoming package deliveries
Aisha Malik
9:00 AM PDT · September 11, 2025
Gmail is rolling out a new “Purchases” tab that gives users a quick overview of their upcoming package deliveries, Google announced on Thursday. The tab will allow them to access all their purchase-related emails in one place, even from past orders and shipments.
The tech giant notes that Gmail will still show packages that are set to arrive within 24 hours on top of users’ inboxes. The new tab simply brings all of your purchase information together under one view.
The update builds on Gmail’s package-tracking feature that first launched in 2022, allowing users to track their upcoming package deliveries directly from their inbox without having to navigate to the appropriate carrier’s website.

Google notes that the new feature will be especially helpful during the holidays, as PwC’s 2025 holiday outlook predicts that 39% of total planned holiday gift spending will happen in the five-day period between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday. The new tab will help users track all of these shipments in a more efficient way, Google says.
The feature is rolling out today on mobile and web to users around the world with personal Google accounts.
Google also announced that it’s updating the Promotion category in Gmail to allow users to sort by “most relevant” promotion emails. The company says this will make it easier for people to see deal updates from brands they care about the most. Plus, Gmail will nudge users about upcoming deals and timely offers.
This update will start rolling out in the coming weeks on mobile to users in their personal Google accounts.
