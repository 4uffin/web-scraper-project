Humanoids, AVs, and what’s next in AI hardware with Waabi and Apptronik at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025
TechCrunch Events
8:02 AM PDT · September 11, 2025
TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 hits Moscone West in San Francisco from October 27 to 29, bringing together 10,000+ startup and VC leaders for three days of bold ideas, groundbreaking tech, and future-shaping conversations. One of the most highly anticipated sessions happening on one of the two AI Stages will spotlight where AI hardware is heading next, featuring a live look at the robotics and autonomous systems pushing boundaries in real time.
AI may be reshaping software, but when it comes to robotics and autonomous systems, the big breakout moment is still on the horizon. That’s what makes this session at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 so compelling. Raquel Urtasun, founder and CEO of Waabi, and Jeff Cardenas, co-founder and CEO of Apptronik, are joining forces on the AI Stage to talk about what it takes to put intelligence into motion — whether it’s behind the wheel or on two legs.
AI meets real-world physics
This conversation dives into the complex systems that power autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots — and the simulation, sensors, and software infrastructure needed to scale them safely. Both Waabi and Apptronik are pushing the limits of what’s possible in the physical world. At Disrupt, they’ll walk us through the breakthroughs and bottlenecks shaping the next generation of intelligent machines.
Why this session matters
AI is already changing how we build, ship, and move — but physical deployment brings a unique set of constraints and opportunities. Expect a grounded, forward-looking discussion on how the smartest robots and self-driving platforms are coming to life, and what that means for the future of industry, labor, and infrastructure.
