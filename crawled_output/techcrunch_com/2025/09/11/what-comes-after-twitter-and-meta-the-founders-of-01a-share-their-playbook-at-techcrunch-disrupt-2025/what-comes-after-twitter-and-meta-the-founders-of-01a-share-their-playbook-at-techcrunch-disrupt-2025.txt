VC leaders from 01 Advisors take the Builders Stage at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 to share the scaling playbook
TechCrunch Events
11:40 AM PDT · September 11, 2025
At TechCrunch Disrupt 2025, we’re bringing to the Builders Stage three people who helped shape the modern internet. On October 28, Adam Bain, Dick Costolo, and David Fischer — now at 01 Advisors — will sit down for an exclusive fireside chat on what it takes to build, scale, and fund startups in today’s ever-shifting landscape.
Before they were backing breakout companies like Tipalti and SpotOn, they were the operators behind some of tech’s most iconic companies.
David Fischer — Former CRO at Meta, Fischer scaled annual revenue from less than $1 billion to over $100 billion, connecting 200 million businesses with customers worldwide. Earlier, he built Google’s early sales engine.
Adam Bain — Former COO of Twitter, Bain built its sales, product, and ad operations from scratch, growing revenue from millions to billions in five years.
Dick Costolo — Former CEO of Twitter, Costolo scaled headcount 400% and boosted annual revenue from $28 million to $2.25 billion. Earlier, he founded Feedburner (acquired by Google).
Inside the fireside: Scaling, funding, and what’s next
This conversation isn’t just about what they’ve done — it’s about where they believe tech is headed next. Expect insights on finding product-market fit, scaling with intention, fundraising in today’s market, and what they look for when backing founders through 01A.
If you’re building a company — or betting on one — this is your blueprint for doing it with staying power.
