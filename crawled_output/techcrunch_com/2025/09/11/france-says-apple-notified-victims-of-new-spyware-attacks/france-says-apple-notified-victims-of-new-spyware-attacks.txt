France says Apple notified victims of new spyware attacks
Apple has notified a number of individuals that their devices were targeted in a spyware campaign, according to the French government.
France’s national cybersecurity response unit said on Thursday that it was aware that Apple on September 3 sent a new notification to affected customers whose Apple devices may have been hacked.
The cybersecurity unit said receiving a threat notification means that at least one of the devices linked to a customer’s iCloud account “has been targeted and would be potentially compromised.”
It’s unclear how many individuals, including in France, received the September 3 threat notification, which spyware was used, or when the intrusions began.
An Apple spokesperson did not immediately respond to TechCrunch’s inquiries.
Apple periodically notifies victims that their devices were targeted and advises them to seek help from Access Now’s digital security lab. Most recently, Apple has notified victims in Iran, across Europe, India, and dozens of other countries of mercenary spyware attacks.
France’s president Emmanuel Macron reportedly switched phones in 2021 after his phone was targeted with NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware.
