Love, lies, and algorithms: Is AI really helping us find ‘the one’? Live at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025
TechCrunch Events
8:30 AM PDT · September 25, 2025
What happens when technology takes the wheel in our love lives?
From dating apps and AI-powered matchmaking to full-on digital companionship, artificial intelligence is rapidly becoming a third party in our most personal relationships. But is it truly helping us find deeper connection — or just reshaping romance into an algorithmic illusion?
Only on the AI Stage at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025, happening October 27-29 in San Francisco’s Moscone West, we’re bringing together three powerhouse voices to unpack the future of love, trust, and tech.
Eugenia Kuyda, founder of Replika, the world’s leading AI companion platform with over 35 million users. Her mission: build AI that supports human emotional well-being — not replaces it.
Mark Kantor, head of product at Tinder and former GM at Zynga. He’s seen how features can drive feelings — and how behavioral design shapes who we match, message, and meet.
Dr. Amanda Gesselman, Kinsey Institute research scientist, whose work explores how digital intimacy, platforms, and emotional outsourcing are redefining relationships in the AI era.
In this session, we’ll dive into:
How recommendation engines shape who we date and why.
The psychological impact of digital companionship and AI “love.”
What’s being lost — or gained — when intimacy is optimized.
Ethical red flags and design choices that deserve more scrutiny.
Whether you’re building an AI product, navigating the dating landscape, or curious about the emotional side of emerging tech, this panel will challenge everything you think you know about connection in a digital-first world.
