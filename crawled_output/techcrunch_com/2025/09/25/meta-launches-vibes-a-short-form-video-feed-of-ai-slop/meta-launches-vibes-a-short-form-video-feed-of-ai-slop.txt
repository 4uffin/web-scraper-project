Meta launches ‘Vibes,’ a short-form video feed of AI slop

In a move no one asked for, Meta is introducing “Vibes,” a new feed in the Meta AI app and on meta.ai for sharing and creating short-form, AI-generated videos. Think TikTok or Instagram Reels, but every single video you come across is essentially AI slop.
Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced the rollout of Vibes in a post on Instagram that features a series of AI-generated videos. In one video, a group of fuzzy-looking creatures hops from one fuzzy cube to another. In another, a cat kneads some dough. A third video shows what appears to be an ancient Egyptian woman taking a selfie on a balcony overlooking Ancient Egypt.

According to Meta, as you browse the new feed, you’ll see AI-generated videos from both creators and other users. Over time, Meta’s algorithm will begin to show you personalized content.
You have the option to generate a video from scratch, or remix a video that you see on your feed. Before publishing, you can add new visuals, layer in music, and adjust styles. You can then post the video directly to the Vibes feed, DM it to others, or cross-post to Instagram and Facebook Stories and Reels.
Meta’s chief AI officer Alexandr Wang shared in a post that the company has partnered with AI image generators Midjourney and Black Forest Labs for the early version of Vibes, while Meta continues developing its own AI models.
Since no one really wants an AI-generated version of TikTok, the user comments in response to Zuckerberg’s announcement were about what you’d expect. The top comment on the post reads: “gang nobody wants this,” while another popular comment says: “Bro’s posting ai slop on his own app.” Another comment reads: “I think I speak for everyone when I say: What….?”

The new feed likely won’t be welcomed by users, especially since the rise of AI technology has caused social media platforms to become flooded with AI slop. The problem has become so widespread that companies like YouTube are now looking to crack down on the issue. This makes Meta’s move particularly puzzling, given that the company said earlier this year that it was tackling “unoriginal” Facebook content and advised creators that they should focus on “authentic storytelling,” not short videos offering little value.

The launch of the new feed comes as Meta has recently invested heavily in revamping its AI efforts amid concerns that it was falling behind competitors like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind.
In June, the company restructured its AI efforts to create an AI division called “Meta Superintelligence Labs” following notable staff departures. Meta then reportedly reorganized its AI division into four groups to focus on foundation models, research, product integration, and infrastructure.
