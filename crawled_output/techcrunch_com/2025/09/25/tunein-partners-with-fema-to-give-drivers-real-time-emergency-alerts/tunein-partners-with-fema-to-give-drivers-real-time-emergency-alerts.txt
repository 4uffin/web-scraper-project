TuneIn adds FEMA’s real-time emergency alerts to its service
Lauren Forristal
5:00 AM PDT · September 25, 2025
Audio streaming service TuneIn announced on Thursday a collaboration with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to deliver emergency alerts directly to drivers.
TuneIn is now compatible with the Integrated Public Alert and Warning System (IPAWS), FEMA’s national system that delivers verified local alerts and critical emergency information to the public. Through this integration, drivers in affected geographic areas will receive real-time alerts from local, state, tribal, and federal agencies, including warnings about extreme weather, natural disasters, and other urgent emergencies.
The alerts are prioritized by severity. For instance, minor threats activate brief notifications, whereas more critical situations disrupt the broadcast with both audio and on-screen alerts.
The system will benefit drivers whose vehicles are equipped with TuneIn integration from various automotive manufacturers, including Rivian, Lucid, Tesla, Sony Honda Mobility, Jaguar, Land Rover, Mercedes, and Volvo, among others.

However, this collaboration with TuneIn launches during a period of uncertainty about FEMA’s direction under the Trump administration. The agency has faced recent workforce reductions and departures that have raised questions about its ability to effectively respond to disasters in the future. According to the Government Accountability Office (GAO), nearly 2,500 employees left FEMA between January 25 and June 1 of this year, including several senior executives.
With FEMA’s staff currently stretched thin, some observers worry about whether the agency can effectively manage and distribute accurate information through new systems like the TuneIn collaboration.
Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stated in August that FEMA has become more responsive since implementing organizational changes. She wrote that, “By cutting redundant contracts, eliminating unnecessary positions, and giving employees the opportunity to quit if they wish, [the Department of Homeland Security] has reduced bureaucratic bloat.”

Since implementing these reforms, FEMA “has become more responsive, getting personnel on the ground and approving grants nearly twice as quickly as previous administrations did,” wrote Noem.
