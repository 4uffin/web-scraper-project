Aaron Levie on building for the long game in enterprise software at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025
TechCrunch Events
4:00 PM PDT · September 25, 2025
At TechCrunch Disrupt 2025, happening October 27–29 at Moscone West in San Francisco, Box CEO and co-founder Aaron Levie takes the Disrupt Stage for a candid conversation on what invention really looks like inside a public company, what AI is changing (and not changing) in enterprise software, and why staying sharp means questioning everything — even your own best ideas.
The evolution of a cloud original
Box launched before “the cloud” was a buzzword and outlasted a wave of competitors that couldn’t scale or adapt. Aaron Levie’s perspective — as both a visionary founder and a long-term public company CEO — is a rare combination. He’ll reflect on the hardest pivots, biggest surprises, and the mindset it takes to keep evolving when the tech landscape moves at warp speed.
Why you don’t want to miss it
Aaron Levie helped define cloud collaboration before it was a trend, and he’s still setting the bar. This fireside chat will go deep on what it takes to build something that lasts — not just in terms of product, but also culture, strategy, and mindset. Whether you’re navigating early growth or managing scale, this is one session you’ll want to take notes on.
