Google revamps Discover page to show content from creators
Ivan Mehta
9:00 AM PDT · September 17, 2025
Google announced on Wednesday that it’s updating the Discover page in its flagship Search app to allow you to follow specific publishers and creators to surface more content from those you like.
The update follows a feature Google rolled out last month, allowing users to pick their choice of news sites and blogs for the Top Stories section in search results.
In the weeks ahead, Google says people will also start to see different types of content on Discover, including articles, YouTube Shorts, and posts from X and Instagram from creators and publishers across the web. Moving forward, Google will add more types of sources to this mix, it said.
With these moves, Google is trying to give users more control over their content, while also expanding its Discover page to include a wider variety of sources.
It is not clear what Google’s criteria are for creator content to show up on the Discover page, however. (A response to a question about this was not provided ahead of publication.)
To use the feature, when you see content from a particular publisher or creator, you can tap their name to view all their content on one page and opt to follow them. Google said it will show more content from sources you follow.
These announcements have come at a time when publishers are seeing their traffic plummet because of Google’s AI search. The search giant even launched a product called Offerwall to let publishers earn revenue from sources other than ads.
