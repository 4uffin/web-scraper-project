Lovable co-founder and CEO Anton Osika on building one of the fastest-growing startups in history at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025
TechCrunch Events
7:00 AM PDT · September 17, 2025
Lovable has quickly become one of the most talked-about startups of the year, breaking records and making headlines as one of the fastest-growing software companies in history. To mark the 20th anniversary of TechCrunch, co-founder and CEO Anton Osika will take the Disrupt Stage to discuss Lovable and the Future of Consumer Tech. Join us at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 from October 27–29 at Moscone West in San Francisco, alongside 10,000+ founders, investors, and tech leaders shaping what’s next.
Building a breakout brand in record time
Lovable lets anyone create apps and websites simply by talking to AI. Its mission: empower the 99% of people who can’t code to turn their ideas into software. The momentum has been staggering. Lovable reached $100 million ARR in under a year, raised a $200 million Series A at a $1.8 billion valuation led by Accel, and has been fielding unsolicited investor offers that push its valuation toward $4 billion. As TechCrunch recently reported, investors are “loving Lovable” — and it’s easy to see why.
The founder behind the hype
A physicist-turned-entrepreneur, Osika co-founded Lovable after earlier roles as co-founder of Depict.ai, founding engineer at Sana, and a particle physicist at CERN. Based in Stockholm, he’s built Lovable into a global story at lightning speed, blending technical depth with a consumer-first vision. In this session, he’ll share what it takes to build a brand that not only scales in a competitive market but also navigates the cultural conversations that come with such rapid success.

Why this session matters for founders
Lovable’s rise isn’t just a startup story — it’s a blueprint for the next wave of consumer tech. Osika’s journey offers rare insight into how to scale at breakneck speed, balance investor pressure with product focus, and carve out a category others have long ignored. For anyone building consumer experiences, this will be a masterclass.
