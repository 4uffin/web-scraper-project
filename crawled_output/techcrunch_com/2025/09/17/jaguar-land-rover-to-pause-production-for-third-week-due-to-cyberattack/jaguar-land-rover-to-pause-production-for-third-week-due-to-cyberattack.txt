Jaguar Land Rover to pause production for third week due to cyberattack
Luxury car-maker Jaguar Land Rover said Tuesday it will not resume vehicle manufacturing operations until at least September 24 due to a cyberattack earlier this month.
In a new statement, the company said it informed colleagues, suppliers, and partners that the halt in production will extend into its third week.
The company said this was due to “the controlled restart of our global operations, which will take time,” the company wrote.
Laura Savvas, a spokesperson for Jaguar Land Rover, which is owned by Indian giant Tata Motors, declined to provide more updates when reached by TechCrunch.
The BBC reported that the IT and manufacturing shutdown is estimated to cost the company at least £50 million (roughly $68 million) each week in lost production, as the company cannot produce the usual 1,000 cars a week, but estimates vary. British daily The Telegraph reported the estimated losses to be £72 million (almost $100 million).
Suppliers for Jaguar Land Rover are concerned they won’t be able to manage such a long shutdown, and fear bankruptcy, according to the BBC.
