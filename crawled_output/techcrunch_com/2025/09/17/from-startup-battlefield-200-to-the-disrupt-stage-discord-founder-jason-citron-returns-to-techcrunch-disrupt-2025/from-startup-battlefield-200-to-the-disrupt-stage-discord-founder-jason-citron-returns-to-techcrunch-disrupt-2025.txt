From Startup Battlefield to the Disrupt Stage: Discord founder Jason Citron returns to TechCrunch Disrupt 2025
TechCrunch Events
7:30 AM PDT · September 17, 2025
More than a decade ago, Jason Citron took the Disrupt stage to pitch his vision for his early-stage company in the Startup Battlefield competition at TechCrunch Disrupt. Today, he’s built Discord into one of the most successful consumer platforms of its era — valued in the billions and redefining how communities connect, game, and share online.
This October, he returns to the Disrupt Stage with “From Startup Battlefield to Discord,” a session that unpacks his scaling journey. TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 takes place October 27–29 at Moscone West in San Francisco, where 10,000+ startup and VC leaders will gather to shape the future of tech.

Lessons from a founder who never stopped building
Citron’s journey from a Startup Battlefield competitor in 2013 to leading one of the most influential consumer platforms today is a case study in persistence and pivots. His session will dive into the tough calls, product bets, and relentless focus on vision that carried him through early struggles to eventual breakout success.
Why this conversation matters now
