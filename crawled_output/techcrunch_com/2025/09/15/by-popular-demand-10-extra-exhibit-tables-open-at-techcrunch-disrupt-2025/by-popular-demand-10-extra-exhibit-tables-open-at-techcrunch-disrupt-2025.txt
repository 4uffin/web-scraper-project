By popular demand: 10 extra exhibit tables open at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025
TechCrunch Events
7:30 AM PDT · September 15, 2025
Back by overwhelming demand, we’ve added 10 more exhibit tables to TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 — this will be the final release before they sell out. This is your last chance to showcase your company in front of 10,000+ founders, VCs, and tech innovators from October 27-29 at San Francisco’s Moscone West.
Disrupt isn’t just a tech conference — it’s a launchpad. Startups of all stages come here to meet their first investors, land their biggest partnerships, and spark ideas that take them to the next level. In 2025, that launchpad could be your exhibit table. Books yours here.

Why you can’t miss this opportunity
Visibility where it counts: No table = no chance to showcase your product to thousands of investors, partners, and press walking through the heart of one of the largest tech conferences of the year.
Access to key decision-makers: Without passes, your team misses direct engagement with high-level founders, investors, and enterprise leaders.
Brand amplification: Without placement, you miss exposure across TechCrunch channels before, during, and after the event.
Smart investment: For just $10,000, you unlock unmatched reach, networking, and lead-generation tools. Skipping this means leaving serious value on the table.
What’s included with your table
A 6’ x 30” branded exhibit table in the high-traffic Expo Hall for all three days.
10 team passes (5 Attendee, 5 Expo+).
Featured branding across TechCrunch channels.
Access to press coverage, lead-gen tools, and exclusive founder data.
Shoutouts during key event moments and closing ceremonies.
Direct access to traction, investor interest, and game-changing conversations.
Book yours before your competitor does
These 10 tables won’t last — act now to own the spotlight, leads, and momentum. Book your exhibit table now.
