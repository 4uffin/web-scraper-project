Divergent raises $290M to expand production of specialized military parts
Amid an ongoing surge in defense tech investing, advanced manufacturing company Divergent Technologies raised $290 million, led by Rochefort Asset Management, to expand production of missile parts and other specialized components for the military.
The round, which values the company at $2.3 billion, was first reported by Bloomberg. Divergent’s customers include major defense primes Lockheed Martin, RTX, and General Dynamics.
The new capital, of which $40 million is debt, will help the company expand its manufacturing facilities in Los Angeles and to break ground on a new factory in Oklahoma next year. Divergent’s specialized 3D printers make up to 600 parts, and CEO and co-founder Lukas Czinger told Bloomberg that metal missile airframes are the company’s “bread and butter.”
The raise underscores investor appetite for startups boosting America’s domestic manufacturing capabilities as weapons demand continues to strain traditional supply chains.
