Snap unveils Snap OS 2.0 with native browser, WebXR support, and more

Snap has unveiled the second version of its Snap OS, the software powering its AR glasses known as Snap Spectacles. The update includes a new native browser, WebXR support, and more. The launch comes as the company rolled out its fifth-generation Snap Spectacles for developers last year and plans to launch a consumer version sometime in 2026.
The release also comes just ahead of Meta’s Connect conference this week, where the company is expected to reveal its latest updates in smart glasses, AI, and other technology.
Snap OS 2.0 introduces a faster browser that’s easier to use, the company says. Snap has optimized page loading speed and power usage to allow users to navigate quickly.
There’s also a new home screen with widgets and bookmarks, alongside an updated toolbar that lets users type or speak a website URL, navigate history, and refresh the page. Plus, users can now resize windows just like they would on a laptop.

Snap notes that the browser now supports WebXR, allowing users to access augmented reality experiences directly from any WebXR-enabled website.
Additionally, there’s a new Spotlight Lens that spatially overlays content onto the real world. Now users can do things like wash dishes while watching videos from their favorite creators.
“The portrait orientation of our Spectacles’ field of view is a perfect fit for vertical video, allowing you to enjoy content without ever having to look down at your phone,” Snap explained in a blog post. “Easily anchor Spotlight in one place, or have it follow you as you move around.”

In addition, Snap is making it easier to relive and share favorite memories with its new Gallery Lens that lets you view your Spectacles captures in an interactive layout. You can scroll through a carousel of your videos and organize your favorites before sending them to a friend or posting to your Story.
There’s also a new Travel Mode feature that stabilizes AR content and tracking systems while you’re on the move, such as in a car or on an airplane.
