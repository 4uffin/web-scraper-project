Kering, owner of Gucci, Balenciaga, and other luxury brands, confirms hack
Luxury brand owner Kering confirmed a data breach affecting customers of its subsidiary companies Gucci, Balenciaga, Alexander McQueen, Yves Saint Laurent, and others, on Monday.
The BBC, which first reported the breach, said hackers stole the personal information of customers, including names, email addresses, phone numbers, home addresses, and the total amount of money customers had spent in stores around the world.
Kering said it contacted affected customers whose data was stolen during the breach, without specifying how many individuals it was notifying.
The BBC said the hackers behind the hack are a prolific hacking group called ShinyHunters, who claimed to have stolen the private data of at least 7 million people, but the total number of affected customers is likely far higher, as reported by DataBreaches.net.
ShinyHunters is allegedly behind a number of high-profile data thefts in recent months, largely aimed at targeting and hacking into cloud-based databases hosted by Salesforce. Several companies, including Allianz Life, Google, Qantas, Workday, among others, have confirmed they had data stolen in the mass hacks.
Updated Tuesday with additional details.
