Zoom’s Eric Yuan and Emergence’s Santi Subotovsky on navigating the second act, at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025
TechCrunch Events
7:00 AM PDT · September 15, 2025
You’ve built the hit product — now what? That’s the question Zoom CEO Eric Yuan and Emergence Capital general partner Santi Subotovsky will take on in their session, “What Comes After Breakout Success?” From expanding into new markets to launching the next product bets, this panel will explore how great companies avoid becoming one-hit wonders.
Expect insights into the tough calls between focus and diversification, how to keep innovating at scale, and what investors look for in a second act. They’ll bring this conversation to the Going Public Stage at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025, happening October 27–29 at Moscone West in San Francisco, where 10,000+ startup and VC leaders will gather to shape the future of tech.
Leading through transformation
Since founding Zoom in 2011, Eric Yuan has guided the company from startup to its IPO in 2019, reshaping how the world connects and collaborates. Today, he’s leading Zoom’s AI-first strategy to transform how people work, communicate, and create. His leadership has earned him recognition on the Bloomberg 50, Time’s 100 Most Influential People, and UC Today’s UC Leader of the Year. Prior to Zoom, he was VP of engineering at Cisco and a founding engineer at Webex, and he holds more than 50 patents in real-time collaboration.
Spotting breakout potential before the world catches on
Since joining Emergence Capital in 2010, Santi Subotovsky has been a driving force behind some of its most successful investments, including Chorus and Openpath. He led Emergence’s investment in Zoom when it was a little-known startup and remains on its board as the company now stands at a $24 billion market cap. He also serves on the boards of Crunchbase, Logik.ai, Zipline, Tundra, and Class.
After moving from Argentina to the U.S., Subotovsky co-founded Puente Labs, helping high-growth Latin American entrepreneurs expand internationally. A Kauffman Fellow and Endeavor Entrepreneur, he’s a three-time member of the Midas List and one of only three Latin American VCs to achieve that distinction.
The second act playbook
Breakout success is only the beginning. Yuan and Subotovsky bring both operator and investor perspectives to the challenge of scaling a business beyond its first big win. If you’re aiming to build a company that thrives long-term, this panel will equip you with the insights to think bigger about your next act.
