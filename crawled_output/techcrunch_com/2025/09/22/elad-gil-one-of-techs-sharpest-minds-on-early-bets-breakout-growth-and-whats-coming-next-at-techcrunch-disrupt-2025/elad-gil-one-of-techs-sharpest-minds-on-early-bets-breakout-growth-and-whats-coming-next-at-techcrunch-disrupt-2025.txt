Inside the mind of Elad Gil: Early-stage investing and next-gen innovation at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025
TechCrunch Events
12:00 PM PDT · September 22, 2025
Ahead of the curve — he practically lives there. Before most of the world had even asked ChatGPT its first question, Elad Gil was writing early checks into companies like Perplexity, Character.AI, and Harvey. That’s just a slice of his story. His track record spans seed and Series A investments in over 30 unicorns and involvement with some of the most iconic names in tech, including Stripe, Airbnb, Coinbase, Instacart, Notion, Figma, Flexport, GitLab, and many more.
This October, Gil takes the Disrupt Stage at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 in San Francisco for a one-on-one fireside chat. He’ll cover his approach to spotting breakout potential early, decoding emerging markets, and what’s next across AI, crypto, health tech, and enterprise SaaS.
