After India, OpenAI launches its affordable ChatGPT Go plan in Indonesia
OpenAI is expanding its budget-friendly ChatGPT subscription plan beyond India. The company launched its sub-$5 ChatGPT Go paid plan for the country’s users last month and now is rolling out the same plan in Indonesia for Rp 75,000 ($4.50) per month.
The ChatGPT Go plan is a mid-tier subscription option that sits between OpenAI’s free version and its premium $20-per-month ChatGPT Plus plan. Users get 10 times higher usage limits than the free plan for sending questions or prompts, generating images, and uploading files. The plan also allows ChatGPT to remember previous conversations better, enabling more personalized responses over time, ChatGPT head Nick Turley said on X.
Turley said that since the company launched the ChatGPT Go plan in India, paid subscribers have more than doubled.
This move puts OpenAI in direct competition with Google, which launched its own similarly priced AI Plus subscription plan in Indonesia earlier this month. Google’s AI Plus plan gives users access to its Gemini 2.5 Pro chatbot, along with creative tools for image and video creation like Flow, Whisk, and Veo 3 Fast. The plan also includes enhanced features for Google’s AI research assistant NotebookLM and integrates AI capabilities into Gmail, Docs, and Sheets, along with 200GB of cloud storage.
