Automaker giant Stellantis says customers’ personal data stolen during breach
Stellantis, the car-making giant behind Chrysler, Fiat, Jeep, Dodge, Ram, and other brands, has confirmed a data breach involving customers’ personal information.
In a statement published Sunday, Stellantis said it experienced a breach of a “third-party service provider’s platform that supports our North American customer service operations.”
The statement said “contact information” was taken, but Stellantis spokesperson Kaileen Connelly declined to answer TechCrunch’s questions about what specific types of customer data were taken in the breach. Stellantis’ spokesperson also declined to say how many customers it was notifying that their information was taken.
Bleeping Computer reports that Stellantis’ data breach is linked to a hack of its Salesforce database, citing the ShinyHunters hackers who took credit for the breach.
The hackers allegedly stole 18 million customer records from the database.
Stellantis is the latest in a list of hundreds of companies, including Cloudflare, Google, and Proofpoint, among others, who had data stolen in a recent breach affecting Salesloft Drift, and a longer list of companies whose data was stolen from their Salesforce instances.
Updated with response from Stellantis.
