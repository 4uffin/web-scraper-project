Elizabeth Stone on what’s next for Netflix — and streaming itself — at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025
TechCrunch Events
8:00 AM PDT · September 22, 2025
As chief technology officer (and interim chief product officer) of Netflix, Elizabeth Stone is shaping the future of entertainment for over 300 million members worldwide. She’ll join the Disrupt Stage this fall for a fireside chat called “What’s Next for Netflix and for Streaming Itself,” part of TechCrunch Disrupt 2025, happening October 27–29 at Moscone West in San Francisco, where 10,000+ startup and VC leaders will gather to shape the future of tech.
Driving innovation at massive scale
Stone will unpack how Netflix is evolving its product and technology strategy — from personalized discovery to global growth, from ad-supported tiers to gaming. She’ll also touch on how Netflix adapts to a shifting entertainment landscape that has seen them grow from DVDs to SVOD to now include Live, all while continuing to delight members with design and experience innovations.
A masterclass in consumer experiences
For anyone building at scale, this session is more than just a look inside Netflix — it’s a roadmap for how to balance innovation, growth, and user obsession. Stone’s perspective as both CTO and interim CPO makes this a rare chance to learn from one of the industry’s most influential product and technology leaders.  Join Elizabeth Stone on the Disrupt Stage this October and discover how Netflix is rewriting the playbook for streaming and beyond. Grab your pass before September 26 at 11:59 p.m. PT to get ticket savings of up to $668.
