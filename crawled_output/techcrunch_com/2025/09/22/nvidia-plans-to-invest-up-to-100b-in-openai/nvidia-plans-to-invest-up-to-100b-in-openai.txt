Nvidia plans to invest up to $100B in OpenAI
Nvidia announced Monday it plans to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI as part of a deal to build out massive data centers for training and running AI models. The companies say they signed a letter of intent to deploy 10 gigawatts — enough to power millions of homes — worth of Nvidia systems to power OpenAI’s next generation of AI infrastructure.
The deal may help OpenAI as it reduces its reliance on Microsoft, its largest investor and supplier of cloud computing resources. In January, Microsoft announced changes to its partnership with OpenAI, allowing the ChatGPT-maker to build additional AI infrastructure with other partners. Since then, OpenAI has teamed up with various partners on AI data center projects, such as Stargate. Nvidia says the deal will complement existing partnerships OpenAI has, including agreements with Microsoft, Oracle, and SoftBank.
OpenAI says it will work with Nvidia as a “preferred strategic compute and networking partner” for its AI factory growth. It’s unclear whether Nvidia’s investment will be paid out in chips, cloud credits, cash, or otherwise.
