TechCrunch Events
7:30 AM PDT · September 22, 2025
TechCrunch Disrupt has always been where the future takes shape, and nowhere is that more literal than on the Space Stage, launching in San Francisco’s Moscone West on October 27. In partnership with the Aerospace Corporation, this stage brings together the leaders shaping the next orbital frontier, unveiling breakthroughs in rockets, satellites, defense, and AI in orbit.
This year’s agenda brings together founders, investors, and operators who are turning bold visions into enduring businesses, even in a market where capital is tighter and expectations higher. Whether you’re a space junkie, a startup builder, or an investor chasing the edge of innovation, the Space Stage will deliver insights on what’s next in one of the most dynamic sectors in tech.
Don’t miss your exclusive look into space tech. Register by September 26 at 11:59 p.m. PT, and save up to $668 on your Disrupt 2025 pass.

AI at the Edge: Startups Powering the Future of Space
