How to build a GTM strategy that actually drives results at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025
TechCrunch Events
10:30 AM PDT · September 24, 2025
Go-to-market is often where great startups stumble — but it doesn’t have to be. At TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 in San Francisco this October 27-29, GTM pros Max Altschuler, Alison Wagonfeld, and Marc Manara take the Builders Stage to show founders how to build a go-to-market engine that doesn’t just support the product, but also scales with it.
Register now to secure up to $668 on your Disrupt 2025 pass, and get a front-row seat on how to create a winning GTM strategy.
Lessons from leaders who’ve done it at scale
Max Altschuler, Alison Wagonfeld, and Marc Manara bring a rare combination of startup grit, enterprise scale, and AI-native insight to the go-to-market conversation. Max has seen the GTM journey from every angle: as a founder (Sales Hacker), operator (Outreach), and now general partner at GTMfund, where he backs the next generation of B2B SaaS startups.
Alison leads global marketing across Google Cloud Platform and Workspace as CMO of Google Cloud, blending brand and performance at massive scale.
And Marc leads the global Startups, VC, and Private Equity team at OpenAI, drawing from experience at AWS, his own startup journey, and now the front lines of AI’s impact on GTM strategy. Together, they offer a 360-degree view of what it takes to build and scale a go-to-market engine that actually works.
From pitch to playbook: What founders need to know
This conversation is built for early-stage founders and operators looking to turn good ideas into real growth. Expect a tactical dive into messaging, sales hires, demand gen, and the metrics that actually matter when raising, scaling, or pivoting your GTM plan. Whether you’re pre-revenue or prepping for hypergrowth, this is the kind of session you’ll want to take notes for. Stay tuned for the rest of the names that’ll be joining this panel.
