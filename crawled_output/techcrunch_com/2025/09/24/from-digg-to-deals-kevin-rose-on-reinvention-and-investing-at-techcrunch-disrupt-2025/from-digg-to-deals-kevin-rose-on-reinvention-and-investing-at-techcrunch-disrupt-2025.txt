From Digg to deals: Kevin Rose on reinvention and investing at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025
TechCrunch Events
8:00 AM PDT · September 24, 2025
Kevin Rose last spoke at Disrupt in 2012, when Digg was in the middle of one of tech’s most talked-about pivots. More than a decade later, he returns to TechCrunch Disrupt 2025, happening October 27-29 at San Francisco’s Moscone West, to talk about relaunching Digg alongside Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian — and to share what that experience taught him about product, community, and building through turbulence.
But Rose’s story doesn’t end with Digg. Over the past decade, he’s become one of Silicon Valley’s most active early-stage investors, backing category-defining startups in consumer tech, crypto, and beyond. As a partner at True Ventures, Rose brings both his founder perspective and investing expertise to the table.
Learn how to pivot when it matters most — sometimes when you least expect it — at this can’t-miss Disrupt Stage session. Secure your ticket today and save up to $668 before September 26 at 11:59 p.m. PT.

Kevin Rose is the founding CEO of Digg and now serves as board chair, investor, and advisor as the platform undergoes its latest reboot. His entrepreneurial track record spans multiple startups, including Revision3, Zero, Oak, and PROOF.
He has also served as CEO of Hodinkee and as a general partner at Google Ventures, where he backed breakout companies like Uber, Slack, and Nextdoor. As an angel investor, Rose has a portfolio that includes Twitter, Facebook, Solana, OpenAI, and Magic Spoon. Recognized by Bloomberg as a top angel investor, he has been featured in Forbes, Time, and MIT’s publications for his contributions to technology and media.
Rose also hosts The Kevin Rose Show and co-hosts The Random Show with Tim Ferriss, where he shares insights on startups, investing, and personal growth. Beyond tech, he’s a dedicated Zen meditation practitioner — a practice that shapes how he approaches entrepreneurship and investing alike.
Why this session matters
In this fireside chat, Rose will reveal how he evaluates founders, spots emerging opportunities, and applies lessons from his entrepreneurial journey to investing today. Expect candid insights on what it really takes to build and back enduring companies, from pivoting under pressure to finding conviction in a noisy market.
