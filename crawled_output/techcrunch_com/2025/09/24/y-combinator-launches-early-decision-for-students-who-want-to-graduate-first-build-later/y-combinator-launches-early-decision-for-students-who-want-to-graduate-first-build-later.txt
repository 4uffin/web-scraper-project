Y Combinator launches ‘Early Decision’ for students who want to graduate first, build later

For decades, Silicon Valley has valorized the college dropout. Founders like Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, and Mark Zuckerberg left school early to build companies and they became billionaires.
That ethos was later institutionalized through initiatives like the Thiel Fellowship, which famously pays promising students $200,000 to leave college and start companies.
For many years, the famed accelerator Y Combinator also quietly reinforced that culture. While it never explicitly required students to drop out, many of its most successful alumni, including Dropbox’s Drew Houston, Reddit’s Steve Huffman, and Stripe’s John and Patrick Collison, joined the program young and left school behind to build their companies.
Now YC is changing that narrative.
The accelerator has introduced a new application track called Early Decision, designed for students who want to start companies but don’t want to drop out. The program allows them to apply while still in school, get accepted and funded immediately, and defer their participation in YC until after they graduate.
For example, a student applying in fall 2025 could graduate in spring 2026, then participate in YC’s Summer 2026 batch.
“It’s designed for graduating seniors who want to do a startup but also want to finish school first,” said YC managing partner Jared Friedman in the launch video.

Friedman added that the idea for Early Decision came from conversations with students. “Between AI Startup School last summer and the more than 20 university trips we’ve done over the past year, we’ve had a lot of opportunities to do that. One of YC’s most common pieces of advice is to ‘talk to your users,’ and we follow it ourselves,” he told TechCrunch over email.
In Silicon Valley culture, dropping out has been almost a rite of passage for aspiring founders Programs like the Thiel Fellowship have turned it into a movement (though it’s worth noting that Peter Thiel himself did not drop out but earned both undergraduate and law degrees from Stanford).
It’s why YC’s announcement is a meaningful break from that mythos that leaving school early is the optimal, or only, path to startup success. The timing is also significant, coming at a time when more young people are questioning both the cost of college and the trade-offs of staying in school.
The new program also reflects a growing maturity in how YC thinks about long-term founder outcomes.
The accelerator has long been a magnet for college-aged builders. Founders of Loom, Instacart, Rappi, and Brex were in their teens or early twenties when they joined the program. But the decision to drop out was often implicit: Do the program now or miss the opportunity.
Early Decision removes that pressure, offering a middle ground between academic completion and chasing entrepreneurship. The move could broaden YC’s applicant pool to include more cautious, deliberate student founders who are committed to startup life but unwilling to sacrifice education to get there.
Introducing Early Decision.For students who want to do a startup but also want to finish school first. Apply now, get funded the moment you're accepted, and do YC after you graduate.https://t.co/YQbvZj0AJm pic.twitter.com/AN1iMm9k9j— Y Combinator (@ycombinator) September 24, 2025
In its announcement, YC highlights Sneha Sivakumar and Anushka Nijhawan, the co-founders of Spur, as a success story from this approach. Spur builds AI-powered quality-assurance testing tools, and the duo applied to YC through Early Decision in fall 2023 while still in school. They graduated in May 2024, joined the Summer 2024 YC batch and have since raised $4.5 million.
YC notes that the program is open to both graduating students and those earlier in their academic journey. It’s a bet that some of the best founders of the next decade won’t need to choose between college and startups. They’ll do both.
The move also helps YC secure talent early in an increasingly competitive accelerator and seed funding landscape, giving students an option that competes with other programs like Thiel Fellowship, Neo Scholars, Founders Inc, as well as Big Tech internships and grad school pipelines.
