Spotify now integrates directly with DJ software from rekordbox, Serato, and djay
Spotify now directly integrates with desktop DJ software from rekordbox, Serato, and djay, the streaming service announced on Wednesday. Users will be able to access their entire libraries and playlists within these programs, making it faster and easier to create sets from playlists and blend tracks.
“You can effortlessly mix songs from Spotify using supported DJ software, curating your sets to build momentum or create mood shifts between tracks,” Spotify wrote in a blog post. “Just log in to access Spotify’s entire music catalog, including your own playlists and Spotify’s editorial selections. It’s a seamless way to take creative control and make every set uniquely yours.”
The integration will be limited to Premium users, and accessible in 51 global markets.
Spotify notes that the launch of the integration comes a few weeks after it rolled out the ability for Premium users to mix track-to-track transitions in their own playlists.
Wednesday’s announcement is the latest in a long list of new features for the streaming service. Spotify recently launched support for lossless music streaming, the ability for free users to select and play songs, new “smart filters,” in-app messaging, and more.
