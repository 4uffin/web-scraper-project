Oracle is reportedly looking to raise $15B in corporate bond sale
Oracle is reportedly looking to raise funds just weeks after the company inked a historic AI infrastructure deal with OpenAI.
Cloud infrastructure giant Oracle is looking to raise $15 billion through corporate bond sales, according to reporting from Bloomberg, citing sources. The sale could include up to seven different parts, with the potential for one said part to be an uncommon 40-year bond, Bloomberg reported.
TechCrunch reached out to Oracle for more information.
This report comes just a few weeks after Oracle reportedly signed a sizable deal with OpenAI to supply the AI research lab with $300 billion worth of compute. Questions of how either side was going to pay for such a deal came shortly after.
The company is also reportedly in talks with Meta about a $20 billion compute deal.
Oracle announced Monday that Safra Catz was transitioning from CEO to instead serve as the executive vice chair of Oracle’s board of directors after 11 years at the helm. Catz will be replaced by co-CEOs Clay Magouyrk and Mike Sicilia.
