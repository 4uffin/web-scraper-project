Google’s cheaper AI Plus plan is now available in over 40 countries
Google’s new, cheaper AI Plus plan is now available in more than 40 countries, including Angola, Bangladesh, Cameroon, Côte d’Ivoire, Egypt, Ghana, Indonesia, Kenya, Mexico, Nepal, Nigeria, Philippines, Senegal, Uganda, Vietnam, and Zimbabwe.
The company first launched its AI Plus plan in Indonesia earlier this month at Rp 75,000 ($4.50) per month. The plan costs around $5 in most countries, and Google says it will discount it by 50% for six months in a few locations like Nepal and Mexico.
The Plus tier unlocks access to Gemini 2.5 Pro, as well as tools for image and video creation like Flow, Whisk, and Veo 3 Fast. Users also get access to more features on the company’s AI research assistant NotebookLM, can use AI in Gmail, Docs, and Sheets, and get 200GB of cloud storage.
The news comes a day after OpenAI expanded its sub-$5 ChatGPT Go plan to Indonesia. Notably, India, where OpenAI debuted ChatGPT Go, is missing from Google’s list.
Both companies offer a $20 per month base plan, but with these new, cheaper subscription tiers, they’re trying to reach more paying users in parts of the world where a $20 subscription can prove costly.
