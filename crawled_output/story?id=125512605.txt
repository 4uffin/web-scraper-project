Spencer CoxDuring his emotional speech, Cox, who has served as Utah's governor since January 2021, said Kirk's murder is "much bigger than an attack on an individual" and that is is an "attack on all of us.""It is an attack on the American experiment. It is an attack on our ideals. This cuts to the very foundation of who we are, of who we have been and who we could be in better times," Cox said.He also emphasized that violence is not the answer.Suspect arrested, identified in shooting of Charlie Kirk, officials say"We can return violence with fire and violence. We can return hate with hate. And that's the problem with political violence, is it metastasizes, because we can always point the finger at the other side, and at some point we have to find an off-ramp, or it's going to get much, much worse. These are choices that we can make," Cox said.While Cox said this is a "terrible day for the state of Utah," he said he is "grateful that at this moment, we have the opportunity to bring closure to this very dark chapter in our nation's history."Popular ReadsHow detectives used genetic genealogy to crack open a 23-year-old cold caseSep 12, 6:51 AMWhat to know about Tyler Robinson, Charlie Kirk shooting suspect1 hour agoDetails of Charlie Kirk's memorial announcedSep 13, 4:19 PM"History will dictate if this is a turning point for our country.
