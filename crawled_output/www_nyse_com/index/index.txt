Today’s Stock Market
Eric Criscuolo, Market StrategistSeptember 24, 2025 at 2:00: p.m. ESTLast night the Yankees continued their yearly routine of clinching a spot in the playoffs. Even though it was done in dramatic fashion with a come-from-behind, walk-off win in the 9th inning, expectations were already high and markets sold the news, like an AI earnings result. The S&P 500 was trading flat-to-marginally lower in the morning before weakening as we approached noon. Losses are modest though with the index down ~0.4%. The
The equal-weight is faring a bit better and small caps are trading a bit worse. Yields are up 3-4bp across the curve, helping push the Dollar Index higher. Yesterday the S&P began the day around unchanged but, like today, lost ground around mid-day following Fed Chair Powell’s comments, along with several other speeches from Fed officials. Like yesterday Energy is the leading sector as oil climbs again. Despite the rise in rates Utilities are near the top of the leaderboard as well. Consumer Discretionary is seeing strength from homebuilders following the jump in New Home sales. Tesla’s 3% gain is also pushing the sector up. On the downside, Materials, Tech and Comm Services are all lower by ~1%. Semis are mixed after Micron’s strong earnings last night (investors are selling the news, MU -4%). Software is also broadly lower. Freeport-McMoRan’s mine and financial update is putting the stock under pressure and accounts for much of the Materials sector weakness. A 5y treasury auction this afternoon was soft, tailing by 0.1bp. Rates markets will keep an eye on a 40y JGB auction tonight. The economic calendar is light today. New Homes Sales showed a surprising jump in August versus July and August of last year (800k vs 664k and 693k). Existing Home Sales will be reported tomorrow, along with the latest weekly jobless claims, Durable Goods, Inventories and the final Q2 PCE, plus multiple Fed speakers.Expand articleQ2 Earnings PreviewWeekly market recapFed RecapWeekly market recapCatch equity highlights and market-moving news.READ NOW Fed recapAnalysis of monetary policy decisions and market reaction.READ NOW 2025 Q2 Earnings PreviewKey takeaways and what investors will be watching.READ NOW IndicesDescriptionLastChange (%)NYSEDescriptionLastChange (%)NYSE AmericanDescriptionLastChange (%)ETFsDescriptionLastChange (%)NYSE TexasDescriptionLastChange (%)Market data delayed minimum of 15 minutesWhat’s next?The NYSE looks forward to welcoming more leading companies from around the world in 2025, growing our one-of-a-kind community and setting the pace for innovation on a global scale.
