Today’s Stock Market
Michael Reinking, CFA - Sr. Market StrategistSeptember 25, 2025 at 2:45 p.m. ESTYesterday US equity markets pulled back for the second consecutive session. Ahead of this morning’s economic data there was some modest weakness in US futures. The economic data came in ahead of expectations which pushed Treasury yields higher and added to the pressure in equity markets. Right around the same time there were also headlines that the US had deployed four F-16 fighter jets to intercept Russian bombers that flew in Alaska’s Air Defense Identification Zone which apparently happens more than one would think but did not help sentiment. Major indices were trading down ~1% at the open but the real weakness could be seen in areas of the market that have become thematic momentum stocks including AI, nuclear and crypto were all getting throttled. After the initial push lower there has been a modest bounce but equities are still squarely in the red. As we head to print, the S&P 500 is down 32pts to 6,606 (-0.5%), the Dow is down 165pts to 45,956 (-0.4%), while the Russell 2k is down 24pts to 2,411 (-1.0%).Expand articleQ2 Earnings PreviewWeekly market recapFed RecapWeekly market recapCatch equity highlights and market-moving news.READ NOW Fed recapAnalysis of monetary policy decisions and market reaction.READ NOW 2025 Q2 Earnings PreviewKey takeaways and what investors will be watching.READ NOW IndicesDescriptionLastChange (%)NYSEDescriptionLastChange (%)NYSE AmericanDescriptionLastChange (%)ETFsDescriptionLastChange (%)NYSE TexasDescriptionLastChange (%)Market data delayed minimum of 15 minutesWhat’s next?The NYSE looks forward to welcoming more leading companies from around the world in 2025, growing our one-of-a-kind community and setting the pace for innovation on a global scale.
