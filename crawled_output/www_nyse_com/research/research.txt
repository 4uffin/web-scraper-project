Ahead of this morning’s economic data there was some modest weakness in US futures. The economic data came in ahead of expectations which pushed Treasury yields higher and added to the pressure in equity markets. Right around the same time there were also headlines that the US had deployed four F-16 fighter jets to intercept Russian bombers that flew in Alaska’s Air Defense Identification Zone which apparently happens more than one would think but did not help sentiment. Major indices were trading down ~1% at the open but the real weakness could be seen in areas of the market that have become thematic momentum stocks including AI, nuclear and crypto were all getting throttled. After the initial push lower there has been a modest bounce but equities are still squarely in the red. As we head to print, the S&P 500 is down 32pts to 6,606 (-0.5%), the Dow is down 165pts to 45,956 (-0.4%), while the Russell 2k is down 24pts to 2,411 (-1.0%).Expand articleQ2 Earnings PreviewWeekly market recapFed RecapResearch InsightsQ3 2025 Options Industry UpdateNYSE Research recaps options industry landscape from Q3 2025.
