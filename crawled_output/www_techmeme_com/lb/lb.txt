About Leaderboards
"Leaderboards" are lists that identify the most influential and prolific writers in technology today.
We offer two types of leaderboards:
General Leaderboards, our "classic" Techmeme Leaderboards, which are determined by the stories featured on Techmeme's homepage over the past 180 days.
Topic Leaderboards, which make up the bulk of a resource that should be of value to communications professionals and publishers. Techmeme's crawler has sorted through thousands of news publications to find the authors and publications that are most influential and prolific on a variety of key news topics over the past 120 days. Sample Topic Leaderboards are available free of charge, while the remaining Topic Leaderboards are available for purchase.
Terms: Topic Leaderboard buyers receive the latest Leaderboard for the topic they select, in either HTML or PDF formats, for $100. All sales are one-time purchases. This is not a subscription service.
For more detailed information, see this blog post.
