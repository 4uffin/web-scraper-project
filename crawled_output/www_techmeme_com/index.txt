White House Press Secretary says the $100K H-1B fee is not an annual fee and it is a “one-time fee that applies only to the petition” in the upcoming lottery  —  To be clear: 1.) This is NOT an annual fee. It's a one-time fee that applies only to the petition. 2.) Those who already hold H-1B visas and are currently outside of the country right now will NOT be charged $100,000 to re-enter. H-1B visa holders can leave and re-enter the

Now Karoline Leavitt is saying it's a one-time fee, and that it does not apply to renewals. Total clown show. [image]@cernovich:   @PressSec It needs to be annual. If the H-1B doesn't deliver enough value to justify the fee, why hire them if it's not intended to lower wages of Americans?Dan Primack / @danprimack:   Flashback: J.D.

Go review the celebration yesterday across MAGA and left of center white collar workers on X. A step in the right direction, but primaries are ahead. This is topic #1Ryan Winfield / @winfieldryan:   @PressSec Major fail then. This should apply retroactively, but at a minimum it needs to apply annually to renewals. Otherwise it's no real incentive to hire Americans instead.Aaron Levie / @levie:   Not going to comment on the specifics of the H-1B policies right now since they're all up in the air anyway. I'd hope that we continue to do everything that we can to get the best and brightest to America, which makes us more competitive in critical fields of the future like AI,Ryan Grim / @ryangrim:   This is extremely obvious. You can believe H1-B visas are exploitative of both foreign workers and American workers, but need to also understand that this kind of reform does not help American workers because the companies they want to work for will all radically shrink. Better@signulll:   did the administration think of the downstream effects of $100k h1b fee? let's maybe try mapping it out, shall we? the h1b tightening (or even just the perception that h1b is a dead end) potentially nukes the intl student pipeline. right now intl tuition is a subsidy engine.@dijadi:   I love when we have three different representatives of this government telling us three very different things because each one interpreted Trump's “weave” of incomprehensible nonsense differently. Very effective, very efficient, very esoterically ambiguous.Jeffrey Wang / @wangzjeff:   50% of Exa's engineering team is not American. Add children of immigrants in and it's ~85%. The H1-B change is obviously terrible for innovation. Luckily there are other programs, like O1. We are 4/4 on O1 apps. If you're a talented engineer that wants to move to SF, pls DM me!@anarseldain:   @PressSec That is a massive mistake. It needs to be an annual fee, and it needs to be applied to current visa-holders. All current visa-holders have jobs which were taken away from Americans by a fraudulent system, abused by corporations. The American people trust you to fix this.@the_memeries:   @PressSec Well this ruined my day. It should apply to renewals. And it should apply to transfers. And it should apply to ones that leave and return. Because if they leave and return so much - why aren't they just employed remotely? Why do they need a visa?@kairosx1_:   @PressSec Took less than 24 hours to butcher one of the best things Trump has done in 5 years as president.Harrison Lansing / @harrisonlansing:   @PressSec Yesterday Sec of Commerce Howard Lutnick said Trump's $100,000 H-1B visa fee is annual, five times in a row. So you're saying he lied?Eric Blair / @eric_blair_2000:   @PressSec WTF are you talking about?!!! Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick was standing right next to Trump at the signing when he (Lutnick) said it absolutely is an annual fee!!!!Ram / @ramprasad_c:   @PressSec To be clear is a phrase you morons should never use. Nothing you say or do is ever clear. The only thing clear is chaos and confusion. Lutnick is on tape saying the opposite.@barefootstudent:   @PressSec Holy smokes. Then the Executive Order solves nothing for current job seekers. And, if the $100,000 fee is a one time event it is just a parlor trick with no teeth. Gen Z is not going to be happy about this.

@rapidresponse47:   Corporate lawyers and others with agendas are creating a lot of FAKE NEWS around President Trump's H-1B Proclamation, but these are FACTS: 1. The Proclamation does not apply to anyone who has a current visa. 2. The Proclamation only applies to future applicants in the FebruaryDeva Hazarika / @devahaz:   We now have an official proclamation that says one thing, an official admin tweet that says another, and a cabinet official saying yet another different thing. Comical execution.Reed Hastings / @reedhastings:   I've worked on H1-B politics for 30 years. Trump's $100k per year tax is a great solution. It will mean H1-B is used just for very high value jobs, which will mean no lottery needed, and more certainty for those jobs.Daniel / @growing_daniel:   It's fun that this executive order was so poorly written that members of the administration are publicly disagreeing about what it meansHubert Thieblot / @hthieblot:   If I'm reading this right, the new H-1B law is the biggest win for foreign students in years. Already on F-1/OPT? You're excluded from the $100k fee + face less lottery competition. Foreign-born, U.S.-educated talent can finally stay if they find work.

[image]Joe Miller / @joemillerjr:   WH official confirms to FT that new H1B fees will apply *only* to new applicants, not current holders or those renewing. Will kick in next cycle. Also it's not an annual fee, but a one-off at time of application.Shakeel / @shakeelhashim:   Even if this is true, the fact they did not think to clarify this at the time of the announcement is a nice demonstration of this administration's incompetenceSheel Mohnot / @pitdesi:   Crazy shit.

Big Tech can absorb the fees, startups can't.Ege Erdil / @egeerdil2:   this is illegal since the relevant legislation only gives USCIS the authority to charge fees in order to cover costs, and is most likely going to get struck down by the courts in a few months people shouldn't discuss it as if it's a serious policy

Ryan / @zvz:   “I hate to tell you this, but a man named Lachlan is involved” Trump is positively giddy about the Murdochs being part of a TikTok ownership group. These are the same people he's suing for up to 20 billion for publishing his sordid birthday sketch for his old pal Jeffrey [video]Aaron Rupar / @atrupar:   Trump on the TikTok deal: “A man named Lachlan is involved. Lachlan Murdoch ... Rupert is probably gonna be in the group.” [video]Dan Primack / @danprimack:   Reminder: There isn't a TikTok deal until China says there is a TikTok deal. And it hasn't done that yet. This has never been an issue of there not being enough U.S. buyer interest or cash.Tommy Vietor / @tvietor08:   To sum it up: - Murdochs and Trump supporters will own TikTok - Elon Musk owns Twitter - Mark Zuckerberg is an amoral choad who is for whoever is in power - Bari Weiss will run CBS News - ABC bends the knee to any threat - MSNBC is dying Look at all the liberal media bias!Dan Primack / @danprimack:   Trump says “Rupert is probably going to be in the group,” vis-a-vis TikTok. Leaving aside that Trump is suing him .... if someone is “probably going to be in the group,” that means there isn't a final deal yet. Or it's getting syndicated — existing backers still in the darkBrian Stelter / @brianstelter:   In an interview that aired on Fox today, Trump made it sound like the Murdochs are personally involved in the pending TikTok deal. I'm told the talks are about Fox Corp becoming part of the consortium, not Rupert or Lachlan individually, per a person familiar with the matter.

[image]Richa Sharma / @richa_lq:   Surge AI is a New York based company? My god, the founder has so many quirks I embodied while living in New York. Strolling up to Times Square at midnight or just before the sun hits. Those were the best of times. [image]@hellosurgeai:   Surge is not a body shop. We work with humans who are skilled, creative, unique (+ paid well, imagine!). So we deliver the best data/AI training available. It helps that our CEO is the “Michael Jordan of AI data.” https://www.forbes.com/...@forbes:   An alum of Google, Facebook and Twitter, Edwin Chen built his data labeling company, Surge, in the background of the AI revolution.
