@techcrunch:   The company notes that translations occur on the user's device where WhatsApp cannot see them, which means messages remain encrypted. https://techcrunch.com/...Poko / @nameispoko:   Interesting, that means messages are likely being sent somewhere for translation if it's not happening locally.  So, what's the point of end-to-end encryption thenJavier Matuk / @jmatuk:   [Translated] Message translation is coming to @WhatsApp.  The feature is being rolled out gradually starting today for Android and iOS, the curious thing is that Android users will be able to translate in 6 languages, and iPhone users in 19 languages.

Andy Greenberg / @agreenberg:   The Secret Service isn't claiming it foiled any plot targeting the UN General Assembly.  Just that a big collection of SIMs (probably used for fraud) could have *potentially* disrupted NYC cell service.  The SIMs were in a *35 MILE* radius of the UN.  —  These headlines are all pretty egregiously wrong: [embedded post]Dell Cameron / @dell:   Seems what's being described here is less about intent and more about potential capability (in the same way a Stingray device is also just essentially a cellphone jammer).  It'd be prudent for now not to read too much into headlines claiming the Secret Service just thwarted an attack near the UN. …Nicholas Weaver / @ncweaver.skerry-tech.com:   Looking at the setup, I don't see how the carriers can't immediately pinpoint where the SIM-farms are and, well, shut them down...  www.wired.com/story/sim-fa...  So much of our security problems are those who are in a position to do something well, not wanting to.Kim Zetter / @kimzetter:   This is best story by far about the SIM farm uncovered in New York by Secret Service.  The intent of the farm is not, as suggested by other stories, to disrupt Secret Service protection of dignitaries attending the UN or taking out mobile service for all NY but about managing criminal enterprisesMatthew Green / @matthewdgreen:   I no longer know what we can trust from the Secret Service, especially when a “Trump speech” is involved, and the mechanics of this thing are a little bizarre.  —  “Authorities revealed that the hidden communications system included over 100,000 SIM cards and 300 servers.”Matthew Green / @matthewdgreen:   I'm struggling to understand what exactly is going on here.  In another administration this would be a big story and we'd be talking about it.  In this one I bet it'll disappear.  [image]Ian Moody / @ianmoody:   Donald Trump addresses UN general assembly as US allies recognize Palestinian statehood.  US president

Secret Service says they found and dismantled a “hidden telecom network” in NYC consisting of 300 SIM servers and 100,000 SIM cards they claim “could have crippled cell towers, jammed 911 calls and flooded networks with chaos at the very moment the city was most vulnerable.”Bobby / @bobbylewis:   since cbs is state media now it follows that this is their framing@hyperplanes:   this is an example

@WPalant@infosec.exchange:   Wow, this is quite some setup: https://arstechnica.com/...  I remember reading about how Mozilla set up a smartphone test farm and were hitting roadblocks because these many antennas in one place would interfere with the electronics.  Well, these SIM boxes seem to have 60 antennas each (per 256 SIM cards), and I see at least 72 boxes in one room. …Dave Rahardja / @drahardja@sfba.social:   I don't really understand the attack vector here.  So there were a huge number of SIM cards and likely cell endpoint radios found, but what was the attack?  I guess they could DDoS the entire city's cell network, but what would that accomplish?  WiFi would still work, as would walkie-talkies, which I presume any UN delegation would have. …Matt Blaze / @mattblaze@federate.social:   Trying to make heads or tails of this “SIM server” thing from the US Secret Service.  —  https://www.secretservice.gov/ ...  Presumably the denial of service attacks would involve overloading cell networks or overwhelming targets, but I believe there are easier and cheaper ways to do that then with 100K SIMs. …@mttaggart@infosec.exchange:   This story is bananas.  If it was a foreign state operation, consider what they could do with this kind of influence over the national cellular network.  But as noted, it would appear to be about large-scale “normal” crime, not state action.  —  https://www.cnn.com/...@ai6yr@m.ai6yr.org:   Hmm, interesting, wonder who funded this absolutely massive cache of cell phone devices and SIMs?  —  (links to .gov)  —  https://www.secretservice.gov/ ...  #cybersecurity #communications #telecom  —  [image]Ronan / @ronanmcd@mastodon.green:   US Secret Service tripping over itself not to say Russia after it takes down network that could have crippled New York cell service  —  https://www.theguardian.com/ ...
