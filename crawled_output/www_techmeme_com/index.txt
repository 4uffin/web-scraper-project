@ibaraeleven:   They know they're allowed to buy themselves out of consequences. They already calculated this before they made the decision and determined it would still be massively profitable. To them it's just the cost of business. These settlements are a form of corporate immunity.Melanie D'Arrigo / @darrigomelanie:   Amazon makes $2.5 billion in profits every 13 days. If all they have to do is pay a fine, then it means that defrauding their customers is legal for a price. [image]Ruben Gallego / @rubengallego:   This is a big win for consumers. Too many companies like Amazon rely on tricky fine print and confusing processes to lock people into subscriptions they didn't want. That's why I introduced a bill to guarantee that canceling a subscription is just as easy as signing up. [image]Lina Khan / @linamkhan:   “What pressure did the White House put on this FTC to enter into this settlement? What communications were there? This doesn't smell right.” Agree 100%. Inking this settlement a few days into the trial, after a series of wins for @FTC and once resources were already spent,Elizabeth Warren / @senwarren:   The Trump administration's settlement fails to hold Amazon executives accountable for their actions. This fine is less than 1% of Amazon's revenue last year — it's effectively a slap on the wrist.Joseph Carlson / @joecarlsonshow:   I love Amazon, but signing up and cancelling should both be very easy.  Netflix has 300 million subscribers and it takes 20 seconds to cancel your membership.  Netflix is a great example of subscription management Good services don't need to trap their customers.  Let this fine be an example to other subscription companies.Jennifer Jacobs / @jenniferjjacobs:   Lawsuit settlement between FTC and Amazon requires the company to: —Clearly represent the terms of Prime on cost, auto-renewals, cancellation when customers are signing up for Prime —Get express consent from consumer before it charges for Prime —Create an easy way to cancelAdam Kovacevich / @adamkovac:   One thing you have to understand about Khan is that she's never going to own any of her mistakes.

More businesses should be raked over the coals for how difficult it is to cancel a service.Lina Khan / @linamkhan:   In 2023, we sued Amazon for tricking people into Prime subscriptions and then making it absurdly difficult to cancel.  A $2.5 billion fine is a drop in the bucket for Amazon and, no doubt, a big relief for the executives who knowingly harmed their customers.Andrew Ferguson / @afergusonftc:   The evidence showed that Amazon enrolled customers into Prime without their knowledge, hid critical information about its costs and terms, and deliberately created an obscure and bewildering cancellation process to prevent customers from cancelling.  As part of today's settlement, Amazon has agreed to create an uncomplicated cancellation process and a completely transparent enrollment process for Amazon Prime.@ftc:   FTC secures historic $2.5 billion settlement against Amazon.
