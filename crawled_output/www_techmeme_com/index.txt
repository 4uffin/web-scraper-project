OpenAI needs compute from Oracle, CoreWeave, GCP, Azure, Stargate... and now 10GW of capacity from Nvidia? All of those other partners, by the way, use NVDA CHIPS!!!!!

For OAI, the biggest question was how they were going to raise the future +$300B as the valuation is already very high, and the cash burn for the next few years is projected to be crazy. On top of it, there isAndrew Curran / @andrewcurran_:   To stay in the game Anthropic must build the Claudegate.Matthew Zeitlin / @mattzeitlin:   so is nvidia basically doing vendor financing for openai but with equity instead of debtShay Boloor / @stocksavvyshay:   The bears say: $NVDA is just buying $100B of its own chips through OpenAI. The reality is that $100B is 10GW of capacity — the power of NYC — locked into NVIDIA's stack. That's Blackwell today, Rubin tomorrow & years of high-margin networking + software on top.Matthew Yglesias / @mattyglesias:   NVIDIA's stock is super-valuable because AI companies need their chips to train their models so NVIDIA is investing in OpenAI (with equity) so they will have the money to buy NVIDIA chips.

David Gilbert / @daithaigilbert:   As part of WIRED's Politic Issue, read @StevenLevy on how the vibrant, outsider culture of Silicon Valley he discovered as a young reporter decades ago, has changed utterly, to become a place bowing before Trump With incredible art from @coldwarsteve https://www.wired.com/...Steven Levy / @stevenlevy:   When @wired asked me to look at Silicon Valley in the age of Trump, I saw the crash of the idealism that originally drew founders—and me—to the tech revolution. Selling out the dream will not serve those moguls (or us) well. https://www.wired.com/...Neil Turkewitz / @neilturkewitz:   It's not that Silicon Valley changed—it's that Silicon Valley's view of freedom was always aligned with libertarianism, not progressivism. Levy suggests that Trump's “values violently clashed with the egalitarian impulses of the digital revolution.” I think that's plain wrong.

Welcome to Tim's America!Aaron Levie / @levie:   @Chad_Hurley It's pretty wild. After using the Air now for just 30 minutes, my old iPhone feels like carrying a laptop.@ifixit:   Did @Apple make an iPhone lighter than an apple? 🍎 [video]
