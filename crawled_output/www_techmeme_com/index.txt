@rapidresponse47:   Corporate lawyers and others with agendas are creating a lot of FAKE NEWS around President Trump's H-1B Proclamation, but these are FACTS: 1. The Proclamation does not apply to anyone who has a current visa. 2. The Proclamation only applies to future applicants in the FebruaryJoe Miller / @joemillerjr:   WH official confirms to FT that new H1B fees will apply *only* to new applicants, not current holders or those renewing. Will kick in next cycle. Also it's not an annual fee, but a one-off at time of application.Esther Crawford / @esthercrawford:   Weird seeing people who are supposedly champions of startups and Little Tech cheer on the introduction of a $100k for H-1Bs given it'll immediately be cost prohibitive for early-stage startups to hire from that very talented pool. Big Tech can absorb the fees, startups can't.Sidhant Sibal / @sidhant:   Breaking on H1B Visa $100,000 Fee issue: -This is a one-time fee that applies only to the petition -It ONLY applies to new visas, not renewals or current visa holders -It will first apply in the next upcoming lottery cycle -It does not apply to 2025 lottery winnersSheel Mohnot / @pitdesi:   Crazy shit. You're left to make the decision: Do you trust this tweet or the official proclamation which says the opposite? Do we trust Lutnick that the fee is yearly or the proclamation (also at odds)Reena Bhardwaj / @reenabhardwaj:   Senior White House official tells me “If you are visiting, leaving out of the country or visiting India, they don't need to rush back before Sunday or pay the $100,000 fee. $100,000 is only for new and not current existing it would be holders.”Simon Willison / @simonw:   Here's denial that this affects current visa holders from an official “rapid response” White House accountShakeel / @shakeelhashim:   Even if this is true, the fact they did not think to clarify this at the time of the announcement is a nice demonstration of this administration's incompetenceEge Erdil / @egeerdil2:   this is illegal since the relevant legislation only gives USCIS the authority to charge fees in order to cover costs, and is most likely going to get struck down by the courts in a few months people shouldn't discuss it as if it's a serious policyBindu Reddy / @bindureddy:   MOST PEOPLE DON'T GET IT - FRONTIER TECH RELIES ON THE OUTLIERS We only have one Ilya, one Elon, and one Sergey Brin. We wouldn't have OpenAI, Tesla, or Google if we had banned H1-Bs And no, it is impossible to know who will be the next Elon or Ilya to pay the $100K feesGarry Tan / @garrytan:   This current policy outcome = massive gift to every overseas tech hub. Cities like Vancouver/Toronto will thrive instead of American cities. In the middle of an AI arms race, we're telling builders to build elsewhere. We need American Little Tech to win—not $100K toll booths.Aaron Reichlin-Melnick / @reichlinmelnick:   They need to PUT THIS IN WRITING. Because right now it's anonymous officials versus the actual words in the actual ban on entry that the President signed.

Christina Pushaw / @christinapushaw:   1. The true competition with China is at the highest levels and the cutting edge of technology. That's why Zuckerberg is paying 8-figure salaries to bring AI engineers from China to the USA. The H1B program & rule change are irrelevant to this; H1B in tech is mostly lower & midAtal Agarwal / @atalovesyou:   VC PERSPECTIVE on H1B: Startups typically raise $2-5M seed rounds. Imagine telling investors: “We need $500K just for H-1B fees for our 5-person engineering team.” VCs will ask: “Why not just build the company in Toronto?” Brain drain via cap table economics.Kevin Hall / @kevinh_phd:   I was sponsored by a biotech startup on a H-1B visa in 1999. What's the plan to offset the impending collapse of highly skilled legal immigrants? Robust investment in American higher education? Nah, AI will probably obviate the need for these foreigners, right?John Lettieri / @lettieridc:   This is a crucial, overlooked fact about the H1B rule: it's yet another way the policy landscape will be biased in favor of entrenched incumbents. Which is terrible for American innovation. Lutnick even said as much in the Oval Office: “All of the *big companies* are on board.”Sam Peak / @speaksamuel:   It's not just about whether firms can afford to pay this new H-1B fee (though you should care a lot about this question if you're worried about startup growth). Even for the many firms you can afford to pay this, they will respond by offshoring more of their operations abroad, [image]Atal Agarwal / @atalovesyou:   One H-1B worker who can't return = → Startup can't launch = → 50 American jobs not created = → Tax revenue lost = → Investors move to other countries = → Next Google built in Toronto Small policy change. Massive downstream effects.Sergii Guslystyi / @juicesharp:   I have almost the same view on the issue but a remark. The early teams (and other mid-size businesses) had almost no a chance to bring anybody for the last 5-7 years because of bodyshops (registered tones of applicants as they don't care who pass who does not) because of lotteryAndrew Gutmann / @andrewgutmann:   @ChristinaPushaw There are 3 credible and reasonable arguments against this policy: 1. It will make U.S. tech companies less competitive vis a vis foreign (especially Chinese) tech companies 2. It will lead to more outsourcing and even fewer high tech jobs for Americans 3. It favors largeNathaniel Manning / @natpmanning:   I've spent my career building startups that require unique talents. Often on a team or 10-20 10-20% of the team is on h1-bs. I've always felt it my duty as an American who has one side that came over pre-1776, to have the company sponsor and pay to bring the best and brightest toGarry Tan / @garrytan:   A $100K H1B annual fee won't bother big tech but it kneecaps startups and bodyshops the same, and that's a mistake. Early teams can't swallow that tax. Bodyshops who abuse H1B should be stopped. There are ways to do that without entrenching big tech and throttling startups.@honorabledredd:   I would think this will also bottleneck big tech in that it will force them to seek a smaller number of talent, and focus more on quality over quantity. It would also incentivize them to build stronger teams abroad. Like Apple built China's tech sector, that could happenSeth Bannon / @sethbannon:   AMERICAN CITIZENS who relied on H1-Bs to work here: Eric Yuan, Zoom founder Eren Bali, Udemy cofounder Sundar Pichai, Alphabet CEO Sanjay Mehrotra, Micron CEO Satya Nadella, Microsoft CEO Gustaf Alströmmer, YC Partner François Locoh-Donou, F5 CEO Andrew Ng, Coursera cofounderGarry Tan / @garrytan:   If you want America. startups to win this is not a secondary issue. It's a meaningful effect.Lilian / @lilianbuilds:   While in London I spent time at some of the best-run startups and I always asked about the advantages of building outside the US: Being outside the US means top startups get all the best people (because there aren't many alternatives). The $100k H-1B fee will only amplify this,Harj Taggar / @harjtaggar:   Startups should feel like an external grind where you're always fighting to get customers, not an internal grind where you're always fighting with your co-founders.

Gergely Orosz / @gergelyorosz:   @anveio Buddy, it's not about req/sec but bandwidth and CPU processing. It's about sending who knows how much live video streams to a dedicated server for the event that wasn't preprated for it Yes I buy it because why lie about it? This is amateur stuff that... happens to the best of us@tpae:   @GergelyOrosz What's worse than claimed DDoS is the fact that your voice activates other people's devices. Sounds like a huge flaw 😂Saja Boy / @anveio:   @GergelyOrosz Do you buy this story? Meta, the company that famously can't handle, what, a hundred requests per second? They didn't load test?Jonathan Zittrain / @zittrain:   Hunh.  (1) Wouldn't everyone then notice on their phones that they'd been triggered to start AI?  Is that what people experienced?  (2) If true, it highlights serious issues where strangers can get people's phones to do things through voice command, like [Article: “Burger King debuts Whopper ad that triggers Google Home devices"]Sarbjeet Johal / @sarbjeetjohal:   This is a classic!  The need for ‘voice to identify mapping’ is an obvious one.  My POV on @Meta 's multiple demo fails: It baffles me that @Meta is trying to do glasses 🤓 for last 10 years and they still miss some basic functions like that.  Not having native internet connectivity is ‘ANOTHER GLARING FLAW’ — multiple demos failed, multiple times, occasionally blaming wi-fi connectivity.  WHO ARE THESE ARCHITECTS?Near / @nearcyan:   *turns on loudspeaker at 5,000 person venue* “Hey Meta, text my ex and say I miss her”@sporadicalia:   okay, to be fair, this is probably the coolest way to fuck up a live demo@dhh:   The problem with media training: Everyone ends up playing the same role, repeating the same scripted gesticulation. It looks uncanny and fake because it is. They might as well just use AI.@jasteinerman:   So here's the story behind why yesterdays live #metaconnect demo failed - when the chef said “Hey Meta start Live AI” it activated everyone's Meta AI in the room at once and effectively DDOS'd our servers 🤣 That's what we get for doing it live!Jim McPherson / @mcjamez:   @jasteinerman Is this copypasta that I'm not following? How can 10's of devices DDOS ~META's~ servers?Gergely Orosz / @gergelyorosz:   Plus, as Meta's CTO, Boz explained: all AI traffic in the building was setup to route traffic to a dev server... routed via Iceland (from California!) Honestly props for Meta for doing a proper live demo. Makes me more interested in future demos, seeing it's no pre-recordedMark Gurman / @markgurman:   Remember Face ID? Failed demo but essentially flawless for users. I wish Apple would go back to live but I don't think it'll ever happen. Much more reach now and they definitely see taking risks for this type of thing as pointless (I don't think they're wrong).Mikaël Dufresne / @purplemikey:   Meta Connect 2025 was short, to the point and sincerely, impressive. It was not the best conference I have seen, but it covered things I am very interested in. Avatar in 3D VR is amazing. Hyperscape is a cool tech. Horizon worlds is making huge progress... And wearables too! [image]@basedbeffjezos:   We should reward innovation and risk taking with respect IMO. Too many mega corps playing it safe. Zuck is one of the few still in founder mode.@theo:   Hot take: Zuck handled this incredibly. Can't imagine how stressed the team must have been. He went out of his way to not put any additional pressure on them. When the lead came out, he consoled them and said “don't worry, we'll share a video of it soon” Great leadership 🫡Olivia Moore / @omooretweets:   Ancient tech wisdom says a failed live demo is a good omen for a killer product 🧘@basedbeffjezos:   If you watch the full video they actually nailed 4/5 features presented. Idk I was super impressed. If the stock dips temporarily it could be a good buying opportunity.Dylan Field / @zoink:   Congrats to the Meta team on today's launches! I saw some of the tech while it was still in development... the glasses, AR interface, neural band and overall capabilities are extraordinary. And yes, live demos can fail. We've all been there. The tech is still awesome. Onwards!Shaurya / @shauseth:   it takes a lot courage for someone in his position to go live and make a fool of himself. everybody gansta in their comfortable controlled environmentsDmitrii Kovanikov / @chshersh:   Firing people who made this product would be very wrong here.  In fact, it's a common pitfall managers in tech do: firing devs who make mistakes and hiring a brand new team.  You learn from mistakes.  New people don't have the context.  People who do know how to fix the shit and get better.  They will get better...Rohit / @krishnanrohit:   This feels quite bullish for Meta. I think they're close to cracking this. A HUD on glasses is something I'd buy in a heartbeat.Yuchen Jin / @yuchenj_uw:   Shit can happen during live demos. But that's better than shiny, staged videos, because it shows what real users might face. “The biggest risk is not taking any risk.” - Peter Thiel once told Zuck. Salute to those who dare to fail publicly and keep going.@benz145:   Two incredibly key things that Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses gets right: 1) The waveguide is very subtle.  You can notice the diagonal slats on the left side of the lens, but these are only one of two sets of gratings.  The other set is directly in front of the eye, but very hard to see. 2) The light-glow shining out from the display (ie: what other people would see when looking at you), is extremely minimal...Both of these are critical to social acceptability.  People who aren't up on the latest tech will probably have no idea there's anything special about the glasses when seeing them in passing, except that they're a little chunky.Kristof / @zenfuturist:   I feel bad for Zuck and the Meta team :/ they swung for the fence with a live demo of some insane tech and it didn't work out. Meta is doing some insane stuff that doesn't get enough recognitionTJ Parker / @tjparker:   Meta execs are ~20 years younger than Apple's and still willing to do live demos. Unfortunately very bearish on Apple.

Ben Torkington / @bentorkington:   if they are not even thinking about the first-order consequences of saying “Hey Meta” in a room full of people wearing the stupid goggles, they are definitely not thinking of the second-order consequences of the stupid goggles.  [embedded post]Kristian van der Vliet / @vanders:   “Sometimes our shit randomly stops working” great advert you dork@chrisdeleon:   holdup does this possibly mean even the people who are working on the hardware pretty much never have more than one person wearing them turned on in the same room at onceKarl Stanley / @karlstanley:   When you're expanding you're losing.  The demo didn't work because Meta's tech is hot garbage.  [embedded post]George S / @harmonygritz:   It's for moments like this, yes, this is why I follow Techmeme.  I'd miss half the fun! [embedded post]@chrisdeleon:   I'm old enough to remember 11 years ago when Aaron Paul turned on every Xbox in the country with a super bowl ad and, somewhat naively apparently, I would think people who are professionals in the field of voice activated devices would be aware of and mindful of that kind of issue ever since, too.Pippa Brooks / @pwbrooks:   Wait, anyone can give your Meta AR glasses instructions?  People can just go around saying, “Hey, Meta, show me <horrific thing>”?Dan Ness / @danodano:   Wait!  You mean saying “hey Meta, start Live AI” into a room of glassholes will activate all of them??  —  Seems like a bozo flaw.Tim Trautmann / @timtrautmann.com:   So they have billions worth of servers and a handful of devices can overwhelm this massive infrastructure?  LMAO.
