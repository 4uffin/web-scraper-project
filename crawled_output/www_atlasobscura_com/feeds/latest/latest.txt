<p>During the wars of religion, the Protestants sacked the region and the statue was hidden in the swamps. Forgotten for half a century, it was rediscovered by a shepherd, alerted by the somewhat bizarre actions of one of his oxen, who refused to move when tasked with dragging the statue to the nearby chapel Notre-Dame-de-Buglos.</p>
<p>As a result, an improvised altar (the current Chapel of Miracles) was built. It has became a place of pilgrimage, and over 60 miracles are said to have taken place so far, hence its name. The miraculous fountain, about 300 meters from the chapel via a wooded avenue, is also said to cure intestinal problems.</p>

<p>He was part of the renowned trio known as Los Tres Grandes, along with Diego Rivera and David Alfaro Siqueiros. Together they were central figures in the Mexican Muralist Movement.</p>
<p>Frary Hall's architect, Sumner Spaulding, suggested creating a mural, and Orozco was chosen at the urging of José Pijoan, professor of Art History and Hispanic Studies. Students raised funds for his fee, and Orozco spent two months in Claremont completing the work with the help of Jorge Juan Crespo de la Serna, a Mexican artist and critic.</p>
<p>Dominating the central panel is the myth of Prometheus, showing him reaching for fire to give to the people. In Greek mythology, Prometheus was a Titan who stole fire from the gods to give to humankind. For this, he was punished by a vengeful Zeus and rejected by those ignorant of the value of the gift. The stolen fire is understood as a symbol of wisdom and enlightenment—an apt metaphor for the college's task.</p>
<p>There may also have been an element of personal identification in the choice of subject: in 1930, Orozco’s work was still largely underappreciated, and, like Prometheus, his efforts to enlighten were met with resistance.</p>
<p>The ceiling panel shows an abstract representation of God, from whom the fire of knowledge emanates. The two flanking panels depict, in Orozco's words, "the ancient times that Prometheus is upsetting by giving the fire of knowledge to man."</p>
<p>The work is considered the first modern fresco in the United States, marking a pivotal moment in the influence of Mexican artists abroad. A teenage Jackson Pollock visited the mural, calling it "the greatest painting in North America" and leaving deeply inspired by its themes and monumentality.</p>

Deep Sleep in Tanygrisiau, Wales

<p><img alt="" data-width="3024" data-height="4032" width="300" height="200" src="https://img.atlasobscura.com/tZIXtj3epsb7cghRKBgYgKXm_0bcYT6_IfXtZ5Uu0TY/rs:fill:300:200:1/g:ce/c:3002:2001:nowe:14:1592/q:81/sm:1/scp:1/ar:1/aHR0cHM6Ly9hdGxh/cy1kZXYuczMuYW1h/em9uYXdzLmNvbS91/cGxvYWRzL3BsYWNl/X2ltYWdlcy8xNGJj/ODYwNC1mZmQ2LTQy/MGUtOGVkYi04Nzc3/MzFhNjljY2RmYjBk/ZmExNTQzYzhlNjM3/MThfSU1HXzYwNDUu/anBlZw.jpg" /></p> <p>Nestled within the rugged landscape of Snowdonia National Park, Deep Sleep offers thrill-seekers and adventurers a unique opportunity: spending the night in one of the deepest hotel rooms on Earth. This remarkable experience takes place 1,375 feet (419 meters) underground in an abandoned slate mine, providing an eerie yet fascinating glimpse into the subterranean world. It’s a combination of adrenaline-pumping activities and an unparalleled sleepover that will leave even the most seasoned travelers awe-struck.</p>
<p>The adventure begins with a guided expedition down into the bowels of the mountain. Visitors navigate a maze of tunnels, dark passageways, and steep descents to reach their underground destination. Along the way, guests are treated to a crash course in caving, abseiling down chasms, zip-lining across underground lakes, and climbing vertical walls. Each turn offers another chance to discover the hidden beauty and eerie stillness of the old slate mine, with stalactites and trickling water adding to the otherworldly atmosphere.</p>
<p>At the heart of the mine, explorers find four cozy, wooden pods equipped with comfortable beds, ambient lighting, and even heating—bringing a surprising touch of comfort to the rugged surroundings. This subterranean hostel is carefully designed to provide a snug refuge from the dark and damp of the underground caverns. It’s billed as the deepest hotel room in the world, and for good reason; there’s simply nowhere else on Earth that will put you to sleep so far beneath the surface.</p>
<p>Once the adrenaline of exploration wears off, the silence of the cavern envelops visitors, creating an experience unlike any other. With no cellphone signal, no sounds of the outside world, and only the hum of generators keeping the lights on, the mine becomes a sanctuary of peace and tranquility. It's an odd paradox: one of the most isolated places imaginable, yet also deeply intimate, as guests share stories and marvel at the unusual experience of sleeping so far below the Earth’s surface.</p>
<p>Beyond the thrill of adventure, Deep Sleep also serves as a window into Wales’s industrial heritage. The abandoned slate mine, once a bustling hub of activity, now lies silent and dark, a relic of the region’s mining past. Guides share stories of the miners who once worked here, hauling slate out of the mountain to be shipped across the world. The remnants of their labor are still visible—tools left behind, rails rusting in the damp, and the unmistakable smell of wet stone—a poignant reminder of a bygone era.</p>

Alcazaba in Málaga, Spain

<p><img alt="The Alcazaba, seen from Calle Mundo Nuevo. " data-width="3872" data-height="2096" width="300" height="200" src="https://img.atlasobscura.com/1L3bPNVmU3fmFnAWBBLH_yoq0tuj9iVMk4F5XWhU23A/rs:fill:300:200:1/g:ce/c:3144:2096:nowe:604:0/q:81/sm:1/scp:1/ar:1/aHR0cHM6Ly9hdGxh/cy1kZXYuczMuYW1h/em9uYXdzLmNvbS91/cGxvYWRzL3BsYWNl/X2ltYWdlcy8wYjk1/YTkxZS05NWI2LTRi/NWItOWE2OC0xZWU0/MTMxODk3Y2IyNmQx/NGJjZDA0OTQyZWJm/NDlfRFNDXzA0OTQu/anBn.jpg" /></p> <p>"Alcazaba" is the Spanish rendering of "the citadel" in Arabic, which is why Málaga's Alcazaba is one of many in Spain. Like most, the monumental structure in Málaga is the product of many centuries of addition, modification, embellishment, and destruction.</p>
<p>Although historical texts mention earlier fortresses in its current location, the Alcazaba as we know it was primarily built in the 11th century and then significantly improved in the 13th and 14th centuries by a series of small Moorish kingdoms, or "taifas," that controlled Málaga after the fall of the powerful caliphate based in Córdoba.</p>
<p>When the city fell to the troops of Ferdinand and Isabella in 1487 after a siege of over three months, it became the residence of the crown's local military governor. As the centuries passed, the Alcazaba's importance as an administrative center diminished, and it served a variety of functions, including as an artillery outpost and prison. Its condition deteriorated significantly following an earthquake in 1680 and a French naval bombardment in 1693. By the end of the 18th century, it had been occupied by the townsfolk, becoming a marginal and picturesque residential neighborhood. It remained that way, partially hidden by the houses of local residents, until 1931, when it was declared a national monument.</p>
<p>The Alcazaba's rehabilitation was initially directed by the same architect responsible for restoring the Alhambra in Granada, Leopoldo Torres Balbás. He took a historicist approach, seeking to restore the structure's appearance as faithfully as possible during the time of the Moors. When construction teams undertook the removal of the neighborhood's houses, they were happy to discover that residents had often simply covered up or walled off the remains of arches and columns — cheaper than demolishing and removing them entirely — thereby preserving these features for posterity. What visitors explore today is the result of the restorations carried out from the 1930s to the 1960s, which combined the remains of the original structure with reconstructions informed by archaeological evidence and historical drawings.</p>
<p>A visit inside the Alcazaba's formidable walls reveals lush gardens and numerous fountains, harmoniously combining manmade and natural elements. The monument's highlights include the arched doorways of a series of original towers leading up into the fortress's residential interior, some of which incorporate columns from the ruins of the adjacent Roman theater. There's also the Patio de las Armas, a small plaza with a fountain and garden overlooking the port of Málaga, and the upper palace, featuring its own water-cooled interior courtyards, elegant arches, and numerous other intricately detailed decorative elements.</p>

Franklin Cider Mill
in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan

<p><img alt="A perfect early fall day to grab some donuts at the Cider Mill. " data-width="1096" data-height="1382" width="300" height="200" src="https://img.atlasobscura.com/zqSAy-BVmsefraSh5gIwm3i3NsK00dday9D6A70VKrI/rs:fill:300:200:1/g:ce/c:600:400:nowe:376:530/q:81/sm:1/scp:1/ar:1/aHR0cHM6Ly9hdGxh/cy1kZXYuczMuYW1h/em9uYXdzLmNvbS91/cGxvYWRzL3BsYWNl/X2ltYWdlcy81YjEw/ZTU2YTIzZDA2MGYw/M2FfU2NyZWVuc2hv/dCAyMDI1LTA5LTE4/IGF0IDUuMTEuMzPi/gK9QTS5wbmc.png" /></p> <p>The Franklin Cider Mill is an essential autumn pilgrimage for anyone passing through the Detroit suburbs. </p>
<p>Located near Franklin, a quaint village in suburban Detroit whose 19th-century main street has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1969, the cider mill is one of the town’s main attractions during apple season, which runs from the end of August through the end of November. </p>
<p>Franklin was first settled in the 1820s, thanks in part to the Erie Canal helping open up the Midwest. In 1837 Michigan became a state, and Colonel Peter VanEvery purchased a property on the banks of the Franklin River. In what was certainly a smart business move, he built a grist mill on the river, and all the farmers from the surrounding area came right to the mill to get their grain ground into flour. </p>
<p>The mill was wheat-based until the early 1900s, when a flood damaged it and forced it to close. It was purchased in 1918 by Robert McKee and reopened as a cider mill, operating during the apple season. Since 1966 it has been owned and operated by the local Peltz family. </p>
<p>The Franklin Cider Mill is an autumnal wonderland. The fresh-baked apple donuts and the cider itself are obviously main attractions, but there’s also a plentiful fall market open every day, with produce and gifts from the mill and across Michigan (including pumpkins and seasonal gourds) plus live music, face-painting, and hot dogs. </p>
<p>The best part is the mill itself. Visitors can walk right inside the mill for a glimpse behind the scenes: Watch the massive waterwheel and the original 90-ton cider press work, and peek inside the kitchen to watch the cider getting bottled and the donuts being baked as well. Before the end of your visit, make sure to toss some breadcrumbs or donut bits to the very spoiled ducks that paddle up and down the water. </p>

Why Won't These Icebergs Leave Canada Alone?

https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/untold-earth-102-icebergs
https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/untold-earth-102-icebergs
<p><em>This is a transcript of an episode of <a href="https://www.pbs.org/show/untold-earth/">Untold Earth</a>, a series from Atlas Obscura in partnership with Nature and PBS Digital Studios, which explores the seeming impossibilities behind our planet’s strangest, most unique natural wonders. From fragile, untouched ecosystems to familiar but unexplained occurrences in our own backyards, Untold Earth chases insight into natural phenomena through the voices of those who know them best.</em></p>
<p><strong>Diane Davis: </strong>There's no safe iceberg to be close to. They can turn, break, implode in a second with no warning.</p>
<p><strong>Skipper Bob Bartlett: </strong>It's a sense of awe, it's a sense of fear.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stephen Bruneau: </strong>It's kind of like an asteroid or a meteor that we see coming towards us. We have a temperate climate, but we have an Arctic ocean. And we have these arctic visitors, which are seemingly so far out of place.</p>
<p><strong>Diane: </strong>You can just look out your kitchen window and see an iceberg. We're that lucky here.</p>
<p> </p>
<figure class="

" src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/105966/image.jpg" alt="article-image" width="auto" data-kind="article-image" /></figure>
<p><strong>Narrator: </strong>Icebergs are typically found in the world's most remote, coldest, and dangerous seas. But each spring, along Newfoundland's northeast coast, thanks to one singular geological phenomenon, something remarkable happens.</p>
<p>Hundreds of icebergs collide with everyday life. What are these icebergs doing here, and why is it imperative that we keep our eyes on them?</p>
<p><strong>Diane: </strong>There's something about cresting a hill or coming around a corner, and all of a sudden realizing that there's an iceberg in the community that is twice as tall as the church.</p>
<p>So that would be about a medium to small iceberg. That's a large one out there.</p>
<p>The past two years we've had very few icebergs, and this year it has been wild. Our icebergs come from Greenland. It takes them two to three years to get here. And the path has become known as Iceberg Alley.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Bruneau: </strong>What is Iceberg Alley? It is a pretty narrow lane that icebergs come barreling down the coast seasonally here in Newfoundland and Labrador. And these are big buffalo. They might well average half a million tons each.</p>
<p>Icebergs are an artifact of continental glaciation. Glaciers creep their way towards the waterline to the ocean, and large chunks of ice break off. We could go out and find an iceberg that is from ice that's 10,000 years old.</p>
<figure class="
"><img class="article-image
" src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/105967/image.jpg" alt="article-image" width="auto" data-kind="article-image" /></figure>
<p><strong>Bob: </strong>There's a lot of life associated with these icebergs. There's a lot of krill that's generated from sea ice and icebergs. There will be a lot of fish that gather around icebergs.</p>
<p><strong>Diane: </strong>Icebergs in the spring bring us seals and many more polar bears. Because polar bears travel on the ice after the seals.</p>
<p><strong>Bob: </strong>You get waterfowl as well, and I know in particular sometimes you get snowy owls on them. Because they'll follow with the sea ice and they'll basically make the icebergs their home.</p>
<p><strong>Diane: </strong>Icebergs can be dangerous in a number of ways. Historically we know that over 100 years ago the Titanic sank off Newfoundland, southeast of St. John. So that iceberg made the full circuit from Greenland around Iceberg Alley and all the way down.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Bruneau: </strong>That incident precipitated the creation of the International Ice Patrol. Each year a specially equipped Hercules aircraft flies out and does a lawnmower type pattern of surveillance to determine what is the boundary for safe passage.</p>
<p><strong>Bob: </strong>Icebergs damage nets. They destroy fishing gear. I started off doing whale watching tours. Now the industry has changed completely. Icebergs are a prominent feature of our tourism industry.</p>
<p>We're getting ready to go. We're going to get everybody to load onto the boats. We'll go down this ladder right here. For posterity's sake.</p>
<p>And what particularly holds icebergs in this area—there's a lot of deep water channels with shallow shelves. They are nine tenths below the surface, one tenth above. And once they get in there, if the currents don't change, they're basically locked in position. Each one is unique. They're all different sizes.</p>
<figure class="
"><img class="article-image
" src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/105968/image.jpg" alt="article-image" width="auto" data-kind="article-image" /></figure>
<p><strong>Diane: </strong>A tabular iceberg is like a table. It's flat. There are pinnacle icebergs that are pointed like cathedrals and things like that. The rounded ones are often shaped by the waves because they've had water wash over them.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Bruneau: </strong>The most beautiful, I think, perhaps a dry dock type iceberg, as its name would imply, has almost a shallower area like a bowl.</p>
<p><strong>Bob: </strong>You can see in the center there, this would be called a pinnacled iceberg. It has a nice peak on it. It is also a dry dock. You can see that some parts have broken off. You've got some huge chunks of ice over here.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Bruneau: </strong>One of the things that becomes more evident when bergs get close is just how different the ice appears to be. The glistening ice surface with water melting on it just makes it look almost artificial or plastic.</p>
<p><strong>Bob: </strong>I'd say we're just going to go past the debris field. This is all founder from underneath, actually. So you have to be really careful with the ice chunks.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Bruneau: </strong>It's like an ocean full of seltzer. The bubbles that are in the ice are really trapped air from the successive snowfall before the industrial age.</p>
<p><strong>Diane: </strong>Newfoundlanders like to collect clean iceberg ice from the ocean with a dip net. They'll scoop it up and they enjoy it in a cold drink.</p>
<figure class="
"><img class="article-image
" src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/105969/image.jpg" alt="article-image" width="auto" data-kind="article-image" /></figure>
<p><strong>Bob: </strong>No, I can't imagine Newfoundland without icebergs. It's as a part of Newfoundland as our whales and our sea life. The good and the bad.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Bruneau: </strong>It's kind of like an artist's painting that's just transient in time. Something that gets wiped out after a week, it's gone. And it will never be back exactly the same.</p>
<p><strong>Diane: </strong>I've said icebergs are my crystals. They give me energy. They can totally change a mood for me. I'm that passionate about icebergs that an iceberg can make me cry. I think it's the most beautiful thing. Everyone has things that they love. And for me, it's icebergs.</p>

The Little Red Schoolhouse of Two Harbors in Two Harbors, California

It served generations of children whose families worked in the island’s conservation, marine science, and tourism industries.</p>
<p>Before the schoolhouse opened in 1987, children in Two Harbors faced a grueling daily commute, boarding a boat at sunrise, hiking up a hill, and taking a bus to reach Catalina’s only other public school in Avalon. The perilous journey, coupled with a near-tragic accident where a young student fell overboard, led local families to demand a school of their own. With the help of community members, boaters, and donors, the Little Red Schoolhouse was built, complete with a brass bell and a single teacher overseeing multiple grade levels.</p>
<p>Despite its charm, the school constantly struggled with low enrollment, at times serving as few as three students. In 2005, it nearly shut down, but locals and yachters raised $100,000 to keep it running. For years, it remained one of California’s last true one-room schoolhouses, with older students helping teach younger ones, much like in the pioneer days.</p>
<p>However, by 2014, enrollment had dwindled below the district’s required minimum, and the school was forced to close. Today, the schoolhouse still stands on Two Harbors Road, its red walls weathered by sea air, its windows now silent. It remains a poignant reminder of the island’s fading small-town life, waiting for the day when enough children return to ring its bell once more.</p>

The Palmer House Hotel in Sauk Centre, Minnesota

Built in 1901 by Ralph and Christena Palmer, this establishment and its restaurant/pub have been welcoming guests for well over a century.</p>
<p>The hotel is a three-story brick building, standing on the corner of Sinclair Lewis Avenue and Main Street. Nobel prize winner Sinclair Lewis, who grew up in Sauk Centre and once worked here, later immortalized it in his novel <em>Main Street</em>.</p>
<p>It was built on the grounds of the town's first hotel, the Sauk Centre House, after it burned down in 1900. From the very start, it's been the talk of the town, with locals embracing it as a first-class hotel. It was the first building in Sauk Centre with electricity.</p>
<p>Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, it was renovated in 1993 to include modern amenities while preserving the vision of its creators. There are now 19 rooms, each with its own bathroom, so guests no longer have to share a common "necessary room" down the hall.</p>
<p>The hotel lobby includes big arched windows and stained glass windows that were imported all the way from Vienna.</p>
<p>The Palmer House is surrounded by spooky lore, with tales of ghosts and spirit children said to lurk on the stairs, play in the hallways, and inhabit certain rooms. It's a magnet for paranormal investigators and curious thrill-seekers alike. Sure, when you first step inside, it feels more like a cozy retreat than a haunted mansion, but don't let that fool you. Owner Kelley Freese, who's been at the helm for over 20 years, has plenty of spine-tingling stories to share about the hotel's spectral inhabitants. Legend says Sinclair Lewis himself haunts its halls.</p>

Charleston Light in Sullivan's Island, South Carolina

At the time it was first illuminated, it had one of the strongest lights in the world. Today, the Charleston Light can be seen 27 miles offshore!</p>
<p>The tower is triangular in shape, not circular, and was first painted red and white. Over time, the red faded into orange, which did not sit well with locals, so the lighthouse was repainted black and white, its current colors. </p>
<p>The lighthouse was originally owned by the U.S. Coast Guard but is now owned by the U.S. Park Service, which has preserved the lighthouse and its related structures including a signal tower, a boathouse (Life Saving Station), garage, plotting station, and quarters.</p>
<p>The lighthouse is surrounded by a fence, so it is not accessible to the public; however, photo ops abound, as you can stop on the road in front of the lighthouse complex, and you can park at the public beach access just a short distance away and walk along the beach in front of the lighthouse. </p>

<p>In every nook and cranny, the bar overflows with presidential memorabilia. There are portraits of Grover Cleveland and Chester A. Arthur, yellowed newspaper clippings of Truman’s swearing-in, glossy magazine covers of Ronald Reagan and his wife, campaign posters from elections past, and life-size cutouts of JFK and Abraham Lincoln. Countless flags hang from the ceiling, and the walls form a patchwork of badges, banners, and political curiosities. </p>
<p>The man behind it all is Mike Driscoll, a former social studies teacher who, after a couple of years in the classroom, decided it wasn’t for him and set out to buy a bar.  </p>
<p>He settled on an 1874 building, once a livery stable with a blacksmith’s quarters, to pour his passion for U.S. history into what would become a Buffalo institution. </p>
<p>His incredible collection began in 1985, when he was still teaching and gathering posters, portraits, and other ephemera. When the bar opened, it contained a third of what it does today. The memorabilia soon became a communal project: over the years, patrons would bring over objects found in dusty basements and flea markets. The collection grew so vast it eventually spilled beyond the bar, with parts now stored at Driscoll’s house.</p>
<p>The aim of this space isn’t to spark political debates, but rather to highlight history and to test cultural knowledge. Since opening in 1986, Driscoll has kept his teaching spirit alive by quizzing visitors from behind the bar. And every Tuesday of the month, the pub presents a trivia night. Winners can hope to win anything ranging from a candy bar to a $10 gift certificate. But beware, the questions are much tougher than your average trivia. (Example: What is the only state that ends with a K?)</p>
<p>Listed as one of the 18 best bars in America by Esquire magazine, the establishment attracts people from all over the country. Customers often end up quizzing each other on their home states, perpetuating the bar’s mission. </p>
<p>While you brush up on your U.S. history, you can do it over a pint of Liberty Lager or Patriot Porter, often brewed with ingredients authentic to the tastes of a past era. You can also enjoy an Independence Burger, for which you’re at liberty to pile on anything you want. </p>

It was one of the first churches in <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/things-to-do/brazil">Brazil</a>, attended by Father Anchieta, who said masses and catechized members of the tribes native to the land.</p>
<p>It was built by José Adorno, a genoese nobleman who came to Brazil in 1531 to establish the sugar industry and who soon became the richest man of the village of São Vicente. The chapel is made of midden stones and whale oil with shells.</p>
<p>Between 1569 and 1578, Father Anchieta is said to have witnessed the Miracle of Light there, when the chapel illuminated from within. </p>
<p>Today, the <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/categories/ruins">ruins</a> of the chapel can still be seen by adventurers. Since its renovation in the 18th century, it has been left abandoned, with public authorities clearing vegetation on very rare occasions.  </p>
<p>Access to the Hermitage is via the Ruin Trail (Trilha das Ruínas), which begins on Rodovia Ariovaldo de Almeida Viana, on the Guarujá-Bertioga road. Acces is free and the path runs through a preserved area of ​​the Atlantic Forest.</p>

<p>The neighborhood is one of the main refugee resettlement points in the U.S., with more refugees than even New York City, and over 40 languages spoken. Families from Southeast Asia, Africa, the Middle East, as well as Latin America and the Caribbean, are all part of this vibrant community. </p>
<p>Seeing the rich variety of textiles worn by women in its streets, Hoeg saw an opportunity to create a communal space around them. </p>
<p>In 2014, that vision came to fruition with the creation of Stitch Buffalo, a textile art center where refugee and immigrant women can sell their handcrafted goods, alongside communal classes and a thrift store of textile supplies. Its mission: stitching communities together.</p>
<p>It started as an embroidery workshop attended by one refugee woman. Today, over 200 refugee women and families receive free sewing equipment, supplies, and training each year. </p>
<p>The organization recently changed buildings, moving into a renovated former factory. Stepping in, visitors are greeted by an open space full of joy and bright colors. </p>
<p>The first stop for visitors is the store, where they can explore products created through the Refugee Women’s Workshop. Products include hand-woven totes, crocheted shoulder bags, embroidered pillows, and beaded jewelry. Most are one-of-a-kind, informed by women’s past training as artists, the culture they come from, and the styles worn back home. People can also bring their clothes to have them altered by Stitch Buffalo’s artisans.</p>
<p>Just behind the store is the Second Stitch Program, a sustainability initiative where more than 20,000 pounds of textile art tools and supplies and over 200 sewing machines find a second life each year. When not used in the Refugee Women’s Workshop or during classes, these materials are available at a discount for crafty people to browse. </p>
<p>Past the thrift shop are the community workshop spaces, where visitors can try embroidery, dyeing, sewing and weaving–often taught by refugee and immigrant women who practice their English as they share their craft. </p>
<p>The organization just completed a giant mural that wraps around the building. Created over 18 months with deep community input, it features textile tools, fabrics, and shapes iconic to Stitch Buffalo. It embodies the diverse community that makes West Side Buffalo such a special place. </p>

The Mark Twain Room in Buffalo, New York

For a century, the missing first portion of Mark Twain’s manuscript was believed to have been destroyed by a printer. In truth, it had been sitting quietly in the basement of the granddaughter of James Fraser Gluck, the Buffalo Library curator who persuaded Twain to donate the draft in 1885. </p>
<p>That discovery reunited the manuscript in full at the Buffalo &amp; Erie County Public Library in 1992. It led to the creation of an entire room dedicated to Samuel Clemens, better known to the world as Mark Twain, America’s great humorist and literary revolutionary.</p>
<p>Today, the <a href="https://www.buffalolib.org/special-collections/mark-twain-room">Mark Twain Room</a> resembles a cabinet of curiosities, with more than 500 pieces of Twain memorabilia sprinkled throughout. There are cigars and playing cards stamped with his face, portraits, rare editions, and the restored mantel from Twain and his wife Olivia’s home in Buffalo, where he once worked as a newspaper editor. Visitors can also learn about his venture into invention: the “Memory Builder,” a board game he patented in 1892 after watching his daughter struggle to remember historical dates. And there’s even the trunk in which the manuscript was found, now resting beneath the fireplace mantel.</p>
<p>The heart of the collection is, of course, the Huckleberry Finn manuscript itself, often dubbed one of the greatest American novels and still the subject of debate today. Only two pages are displayed at a time, rotating monthly in the climate-controlled room. Twain's edits sprawl across the margins, his words scratched out, revised, and made “folksier” as he worked to capture a new American literary voice: realism. To stand in front of the manuscript feels like stepping inside his train of thought.</p>
<p>Twice a year, the exhibition changes, exploring themes like “Twain in Hollywood.” Beyond this room, the library holds other marvels: an unpublished Louisa May Alcott poem, a medieval manuscript collection, a letter written by Charlotte Brontë, and a rare complete set of Shakespeare's 17th-century folios. </p>
<p>Such riches reflect Buffalo’s standing during the Gilded Age. The city's main street, Delaware Avenue—known as Millionaires’ Row—was lined with the mansions of leading industrialists, and Twain himself. The residue of that lavish era lives on in the treasures of the Buffalo &amp; Erie County Public Library, a town square of culture and arts that was fundamental to the city's cultural development.</p>

<hr class="baseline-grid-hr" />
<p><strong>Dylan Thuras: </strong>Washington Park in Portland, Oregon. It's a pretty funky place. It's built into the hillside. You spend a lot of your time wandering around and kind of stumbling across things. Things like maybe a zoo or an amphitheater; or, perhaps, you take one turn and you come upon this enormous rose garden.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel Burlington: </strong>I remember just walking down the stairs and being like, "Whoa, where am I?" I don't even know what's going on. I'm smelling things; there's so many colors. That was my first experience coming to the Rose Garden before I even got this role.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan: </strong>This is Rachel Burlington. She's the curator of this garden, meaning she spends her time making sure that all of these roses are happy. And there are a ton of roses to keep happy.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel: </strong>We have over 10,000 roses—individual rose bushes—and we have about 625 varieties. So we have striped ones, we have pink ones, we have bicolor ones, we have little ones, we have big ones. We have virtually every type of rose you can think of.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan: </strong>When I first started learning about the garden, I kept running into this story about how it had gotten started. And the story goes back to World War I. Europe is being torn up by this horrible conflict, and so the people of Portland decide, "We want to offer help."</p>
<p>They reached out to gardeners over there saying, "We can help you save your plants from destruction. Send your roses to us, and we will keep them safe and growing until after the war." A beautiful gesture of kindness from one gardener to another. It's a great story. There is, of course, one major problem.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel: </strong>I have not found any evidence to say that that's true. There's nothing to corroborate that.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan: </strong>This story—it really always nagged at Rachel. It became almost the bane of her existence. You might say, the thorn on her rose. So she decided, "Okay, I need to do some research of my own. I'm going to set the story straight. I'm going to dig into the archives and find out actually how this garden came to be."</p>
<p><strong>Rachel: </strong>I'm still kind of knee deep in it, and it's really exciting. Like with any mystery, you just start pulling up the thread, and then the whole thing unravels.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan: </strong>I'm Dylan Thuras, and this is Atlas Obscura, a celebration of the world's strange, incredible, and wondrous places. This episode is brought to you in partnership with Travel Portland. And today—I didn't realize this—but Portland is known as the City of Roses. Getting this title, clinching the champion spot, was a real street fight.</p>
<p>Today, we hear from Rachel about this story, and we hear from her about the city's secret weapon in that fight. It was this garden—specifically this test garden, a kind of a cross between a beautiful, peaceful park and a mad scientist's laboratory. Less World War I, and more War of the Roses. That story, after this.</p>

<p><strong>Dylan: </strong>I am a bad gardener. I try every year to grow things, and it just fails, but we do have roses growing in our backyard. And I've learned a thing or two about roses over the years, and I'm going to pass one on to you. The first is that rose people are very, very serious about roses.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel: </strong>I feel like there are rose people, and there are plant people. Rose people are its own thing of horticulture.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan: </strong>That's Rachel Burlington again. Yeah, rose people are so serious that they actually have a pretty good idea of when the very first rose bush was planted in Portland, which was all the way back in 1837. Rose people...they just keep track of this kind of thing. And here's the other thing about roses.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel: </strong>Roses have had a reputation for not being the easiest to grow. Sometimes roses have a bad reputation for being high-maintenance and disease-prone, and certainly that was the case.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan: </strong>Roses are very finicky. They get diseases easily. They get fungal diseases in humid environments. I mean, humidity is basically the kryptonite of roses. But then people tried to grow roses in Portland, and they were surprised.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel: </strong>Portland has the ideal weather: basically a combination of mild and wet winters, warm and dry summers. That perfect concoction creates the best climate. In fact, sometimes I feel like people come in here and say, "These are the best." I almost feel like I'm cheating. I'm like, "I literally just planted it and didn't do anything."</p>
<p><strong>Dylan: </strong>Rose growing in Portland really started to take off. By the late 1800s, rose enthusiasts had formed the Portland Rose Society, the first of its kind in the US. And the society began hosting big annual rose shows. By 1904, these shows included a pageant and a parade.</p>
<p>The rose business was blooming. Then, as 1905 rolled around, the city decided they were ready to go much bigger—to pitch themselves to the rest of the country and to the world. But they were not alone in this ambition.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel: </strong>Around that time, a lot of these West Coast cities were developing. They're trying to attract population. They're trying to get people to invest in their cities.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan: </strong>Portland decided they were going to throw a big exposition, something like a World's Fair festival that would bring visitors and investors into the city. The official theme was going to be the 100th anniversary of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. But, unofficially, they thought they'd try out a new sort of ad campaign, a new kind of city identity—something snappy, something people could know Portland by. So they thought, "What about all these roses? What if we made Portland the Rose City?"</p>
<p><strong>Rachel: </strong>If everyone sees the City of Roses, well...roses are hard to take care of. "There must be really good weather, so maybe we should consider moving there."</p>
<p><strong> Dylan: </strong>So, for the 1905 exposition, they decided to plan a big floral centerpiece, this parade. And then along the parade route, they planted roses—an insane, incredible amount of roses. 200 miles of roses of a very specific variety, actually—something called the Madame Caroline Testout. Yes, rose people very much keep track of this sort of thing.</p>
<figure class=" contains-caption "><img class="article-image with-structured-caption " src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/105927/image.jpg" alt="article-image" width="auto" data-kind="article-image" /></figure>
<p><strong>Rachel: </strong>They wanted to cement their name as City of Roses because they wanted to advertise to the world that it was a great place to live.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan: </strong>Here is the point at which Rachel starts digging into this story, seeing what the archives can tell us all about this. As it turns out, Portland was not the only city vying to be the City of Roses. A lot of other cities on the West Coast also wanted to advertise their great weather, their good planting environment. And so here comes the villain of our story: Tacoma, Washington (and also Seattle and some other cities in California).</p>
<p><strong>Rachel: </strong>It's quite funny because I've always heard this story about how Portland competed with Tacoma and Seattle to be the City of Roses. And so, actually, I was reading through some old newspapers, and quite literally they were competing for this title, and it was pretty heated. And there were a lot of articles being like, "Oh no, what if we don't get it?" and that type of thing.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan: </strong>Portland was trying to come up with ways to stay one step ahead of the competition. In particular, a guy named Jesse Curry started doing some scheming. He was also a concrete executive. He wrote frequently for the local paper, and he was a big time rose guy. Curry struck up a correspondence with an unusual local celebrity, a priest named Father George Schoener, who liked to dabble in plant hybridization.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel: </strong>He's known as the plant wizard. So that's literally what a lot of head of lawyers called him, but he was very productive in crossing roses and other plants. And so there are some letters where Schoener is encouraging Jesse Curry to not only have a garden, but to make it a test garden.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan: </strong>A test garden: a place to test out new rose varieties. This was very interesting to people like Father Schoener, who was kind of coming up with his own varieties in his own backyard, breeding roses for different traits, different colors. And it would be very interesting to rose growers internationally—to companies trying to bring brand new rose varieties to market.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel: </strong>There's certain criteria like: Is it pretty? Does it have a consistent shape? Is it vigorous? Drought tolerant? And another thing that people might not think about is there's a self-cleaning trait. Self-cleaning means it does not have to be deadheaded, which means that, basically, the spent blooms fall off on their own and then re-bloom without that care. So, we talk about trying to make the rose low maintenance. You know, give the people what they want.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan: </strong>Jesse Curry started lobbying officials in Portland to make this happen. But to make it a true test garden, they were also working with companies and getting brand new varieties before they ever went to market. And he also had to get approval of this organization called the American Rose Society. It is a lot like trying to get the IOC to make your city the host of the Olympics. The society wants a big commitment of land, money, manpower, all in advance.</p>
<p>This whole thing is happening in the middle of World War I. There is just a lot of other stuff going on. So, Portland's attention seems to waver a bit, and sensing an opening...in swoops Tacoma. Here is a headline from 1919: "Rose test garden may go to Tacoma." And I quote, "Portland, known from ocean to ocean as the City of Roses, stands in danger of losing its preeminence through indifference on the part of the Portland citizens." It goes on to say that Tacoma offered unlimited acreage and greatest cooperation from local officials if the test garden went to them.</p>
<figure class=" contains-caption "><img class="article-image with-structured-caption " src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/105922/image.jpg" alt="article-image" width="auto" data-kind="article-image" /></figure>
<p><strong>Rachel: </strong>And then that just sets the alarm for Portland. "Oh no, we're at risk of not having our test garden! We're the city of roses; that's unacceptable!" So, that kind of lit some fire under people's bellies and expedited the process and just renewed people's interest in it.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan: </strong>Finally, Portland got their garden off the ground. Or maybe I should say <em>on</em> the ground. It was officially dedicated in 1924. Let's go back for a second to the story we first told—the one about World War I and saving plant varieties and all of that. As it turns out, Curry and other organizers had been collecting specimens for a few years leading up to the garden's opening. Specimens from all over the U.S., but even some from Europe.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel: </strong>Inadvertently there might've been some varieties that came over from Europe that were saved because they just sent it over for testing.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan: </strong>Perhaps there was a little bit of truth to that story after all. Today, Portland's garden is still a test garden, meaning that if you go visit, you will be able to see new varieties of roses that are not on the market yet. As surprising as it seems, there are new roses coming out all the time. They drop new roses, like, very regularly.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel: </strong>There's this big market for roses. If you keep releasing, people are gonna be like, "What's the new rose? I want it; I want to have it in my garden."</p>
<p><strong>Dylan: </strong>Growers are always experimenting with new ways to grab people's attention. One very obvious one is trying out new colors.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel: </strong>There's a rose that is a green rose because it actually doesn't have any petals. It just overproduces the sepals, which actually hold the petals. And so it is technically the green rose.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan: </strong>And one experimentation that I had never even considered is new smells.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel: </strong>It isn't just your typical rose smell. Like, I'm noticing more fruity ones. I'm also noticing this type of smell that reminds me of Jolly Ranchers.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan: </strong>Does a rose smell as sweet by any other name? Because it sounds like by some names, they smell like Jolly Ranchers. I guess that is sweet. Anyway, these are just some of the many wonders that you will find if you go to the garden and take some time to stop and smell the roses.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel: </strong>You know, I'm working in the garden. I'm getting over here stuff. And like the funny comments people come up with when they're just like, oh, I didn't know a rose could look like that. Or I heard a big "Crikey!" once. And so just being able to witness people's amazing expression, kind of similar to how I reacted. That really makes it really special.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan: </strong>The International Rose Test Garden is totally free to visit. If you see any varieties you really like that are currently on the market, you can scan the QR code next to them, and then you will have these roses in your garden.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> We want to make sure everyone goes home with a new plant friend or a future plant friend.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan:</strong> And they will be your problem.</p>

<p><strong>Dylan: </strong>I am good. So, I’m going to ask you some questions and have you help paint a picture of this particular place we’re visiting today. I’m a tourist in New York City in the 1800s. So, you know, like, top hat, dressed fancy. I don’t know. And I’m there to visit a very specific graveyard called Trinity Churchyard in Lower Manhattan. It’s a really famous place already back then. It has a bunch of very famous people buried there. It’s got Alexander Hamilton. But actually, I look and I see that all these people are gathered around this one specific grave. What is going on over there? What is this scene that I’m looking at?</p>
<p><strong>Allegra: </strong>Well, there is a grave that’s the only one in the churchyard that’s marked out with flowers. And that’s so people can easily find it because the caretakers are sick of people coming up to ask where this specific grave is. The people that are coming up to this grave, they’re men, they’re women, maybe even newly married couples hand in hand. And they’re leaving more flowers. They’re leaving cards. They’re even crying at this grave.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan: </strong>So obviously, this is someone in this big deal grave site. Whose grave is this?</p>
<p><strong>Allegra: </strong>Well, so here’s the thing. The gravestone says Charlotte Temple. But Charlotte Temple is a fictional character. She never existed. And there’s nobody actually buried in the grave.</p>
<p>I’m Dylan Thuras, and this is <em>Atlas Obscura</em>, a celebration of the world’s strange, incredible, and wondrous places. Today, we visit a strange gravestone inside a very famous cemetery. And we learn what this particular gravestone with no one under it, and in fact, a name of a person who never even existed, says about fandom, about pop culture, and about the strange nature of human beings.</p>

<p><strong>Dylan: </strong>So Allegra, in addition to being Atlas Obscura’s community editor, you are writing a book about the history of fandom. But you’re looking deep into the roots of fandom. You’re going like way, this is way before Taylor Swift. This is kind of into the old-timey fandom world. So what are some examples of early origins of fandom culture?</p>
<p><strong>Allegra:</strong> Well, yeah, that’s the thing. It goes back further than most people think. Lord Byron had a fleet of obsessed fangirls writing him letters. Charles Dickens, he had people lining up for hours to watch his readings. There was public outcry when Arthur Conan Doyle killed off Sherlock Holmes. It’s a whole thing.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan: </strong>Yeah, it’s interesting because in all of these, you see things that feel really modern, right? Even the beat, like getting angry at an author for betraying the world that they’ve built, which is, you know, is a strange thing, but it also has really deep roots. So how did you get into this? How did you develop this interest in fandom?</p>
<p><strong>Allegra: </strong>Well, I have always been a fangirl, and I’ve always been a nerd. So when I get into something new, you know, that has a long history, like <em>Doctor Who</em> or the Beatles, I’m so interested in going back and looking at who were sort of the first fans that liked this thing, and in what ways were they like me, and in what ways weren’t they like me? And that has continued as I’ve gotten deeper and deeper into history, just led me down more and more interesting paths where I keep finding all of these incredibly fascinating fandoms from earlier and earlier in history that just keep resonating so deeply with my own experiences as a fan. So my research is all about bringing those stories to light, and Charlotte Temple’s grave is such a fantastic example because it seems like something right out of modern day fandom.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan:</strong> Let’s return to the Trinity Churchyard and this strange gravestone. Tell us, why are all these people here to celebrate this fictional woman? Who was the mysterious Charlotte Temple?</p>
<p><strong>Allegra:</strong> Charlotte Temple, she was the title character in a 1971 novel by Susanna Rowson called <em>Charlotte, A Tale of Truth</em>. It was also published under the name <em>Charlotte Temple</em> in some places.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan: </strong>You know, unfortunately, this is one fandom that fell off over time because I am completely unfamiliar with this story. What’s the kind of basic overview of the plot?</p>
<p><strong>Allegra:</strong> Yeah, I mean, I had never heard of it either. But basically, the story is that Charlotte is this naive teenage British girl who gets seduced by the villainous rake, Lord Montraville. And he takes her to America and then abandons her when he goes off to marry another woman, because he hadn’t married Charlotte. He marries another woman and then goes off to fight in the Revolutionary War. And so after being abandoned, she dies penniless in wintry New York City after giving birth to an illegitimate child. And the book ends with her father arriving too late to save her from her fate.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan: </strong>This is a bummer of a story, but it seems like it must have been also incredibly popular, like a real tearjerker, a kind of ultimate, you know, <em>Lifetime</em> movie vibe of books.</p>
<p><strong>Allegra: </strong>Absolutely. I mean, it’s the exact same kind of thing that’s just playing on people’s heartstrings. It was so popular. I mean, it was the best selling novel in America for half a century, for decades, right up until the release of <em>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</em>. So that’s a long time.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan:</strong> What? That’s crazy. It’s crazy I’ve never heard of this book. Like, it’s wild that it was bestseller for decades. What was it about it that it really hit people? Obviously, it’s got these huge sort of pulling on your heartstrings, these emotional resonances. But was there something else that made it kind of really work for people of the time?</p>
<p><strong>Allegra:</strong> Yeah, like one theory, and I find this so interesting, is that the story appealed to all different kinds of Americans because it was the story about this young, vulnerable woman being faced with difficult circumstances in New York after betrayal by a powerful Englishman. And that was kind of parallel to the story of America, which was such a new country at the time. And, you know, the book was published first in England, and it did okay. But it wasn’t until it made it to the United States that it really took off. So, you know, in Charlotte Temple, American readers, they saw not only like these sort of this personal moral and like, you know, this sort of like, you know, relatable, tear-jerking sadness, but actually in a larger sense, kind of like their country’s struggle for independence in this post-revolutionary era. And so as a result, Charlotte herself kind of became a bit of a folk hero.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan: </strong>Yeah, I hadn’t thought about that. But like the English cad is like the perfect foil, like he’s like the perfect villain for an American audience. And yeah, I mean, America at this time is still an emerging nation. It’s maybe not always the easiest place to live. So maybe, yeah, people are seeing themselves in this woman’s desperate struggles to survive.</p>
<p><strong>Allegra: </strong>Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan: </strong>Maybe this is a silly question, but like, are a lot of people reading these kinds of novels at the time? Has literature become a major form of public entertainment at this point?</p>
<p><strong>Allegra: </strong>Absolutely. So the 18th century saw the rise of the novel. And America was a particularly literate country. So novels were the hot thing, you know, in England, but also across the pond. And throughout the 18th century, there were these books that were just total smash hits. Samuel Richardson’s <em>Pamela</em>, Henry Fielding’s <em>Tom Jones</em>. These are all books about the life story of one main character and all their trials and tribulations, which is definitely the formula that Charlotte Temple fits in.</p>
<p>And you had women writers finding success as novelists. You had Maria Edgeworth. And then at the very end of the century, she inspired Jane Austen to write her own books. But the thing is that reading novels in particular was kind of scandalous. I mean, like not scandalous, it’s just trashy. I guess it was the equivalent of like, I guess watching reality TV today, like super, super popular, but people might look down on you for doing it, especially if you’re a woman.</p>
<p>This idea of being enraptured by fiction was, you know, not given a lot of credit by intellectuals, right? There was this thought that everyday readers, especially women and young people, they didn’t have the discernment to tell what was real and what wasn’t, and that novels were basically big lies.</p>
<p>So the moral of a novel was so important because it had to justify telling what was essentially a big lie that people would believe. The author had to be imparting this really serious message. So in <em>Charlotte Temple</em>, it’s all about the dangers facing young women, the consequences of succumbing to temptation.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan: </strong>So people fall in love with this book. They fall in love with Charlotte. They, you know, come to visit Charlotte’s gravestone. What is going on here? Like there’s no—this is not a gravestone above someone else. It’s not a gravestone of someone else named Charlotte Temple. Like, what did they think they were doing when they came to visit this gravestone?</p>
<p><strong>Allegra:</strong> Well, that’s the thing is that plenty of people did think she was real, especially because the author always insisted that Charlotte was based on a real person. So a lot of the, you know, sort of articles and the writing around the book at the time was people trying to figure out, like, who is she based on? I mean, that’s something that people still do today is like, oh, who is this character in the novel based on?</p>
<p>But after over a century of curiosity, Trinity Church actually investigated the grave, you know, this was in the last 20 years, and they pried up the top of the slab to see if there was a burial vault of any kind underneath. They even stuck a camera down in there and just, no, it’s just dirt. There is nobody buried down there. Maybe there was some inspiration for the character of Charlotte Temple from somebody real, but whoever that was, they’re certainly not in the grave.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan: </strong>It’s very savvy to be like, “Oh, this is a real person, but I’m not going to tell you who it is.”</p>
<p><strong>Allegra:</strong> It’s a marketing strategy. It gets people talking.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan: </strong>Totally. And they can also project it sort of onto the people they know and onto themselves. It’s like, “no, no, it’s real. It’s true.” Okay, so we’ve established that there’s nothing under there. It’s a bunch of dirt. How did this gravestone get there? This is a very sought after place to be buried. It is in the center of what was Manhattan even at the time. This is kind of pretty centrally located. It’s an esteemed cemetery. How did this strange fictional gravestone get in there?</p>
<p><strong>Allegra: </strong>So there is an official sort of line, I guess it’s an official theory that is told by the church guides today, because of course there’s no proof, but most likely the gravestone was the work of a stonecutter who was involved in the reconstruction of the church. This was in the 1840s. So it’s already, you know, 40, 50 years after the book was published and it’s still remembered so well that a stonecutter, a fan of the book was like, “Wouldn’t it be cool if this was here?”</p>
<p><strong>Dylan: </strong>Interesting. It sounds like there’s another theory. You’re like, “That’s the official theory.” What’s the unofficial theory?</p>
<p><strong>Allegra:</strong> I kind of like this one more. I don’t know if it’s any likelier, but it’s a little more interesting. So in the 1840s, the era of tourism was beginning, right? And regular people, thanks to the trains basically, and the affordability of travel, they’re starting to go places and guidebooks to places like New York City are beginning to be published. And Charlotte Temple’s grave might’ve been the original kind of tourist trap.</p>
<p>You know, at the time there were some really, really popular theatrical adaptations of Charlotte Temple’s story being put on by impresarios like P.T. Barnum. And so some suspect that it was P.T. Barnum himself who paid the Trinity stonecutter to carve the slab so that he could then make another buck giving tours. I think that’s a great story, although there’s no proof.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan:</strong> I fully subscribe to this theory. It is much funnier and also fully a thing that P.T. Barnum would do. He was such a crafty little sneak. I love this theory. It also kind of jives with what we’re talking about, which is, it feels distinctly modern. It’s like the version of the ice cream museum or something where it’s like a thing made specifically so tourists will come and be like, oh, we got to do this thing. It’s riding on the coattails of all this like accumulated cultural knowledge. I really like that.</p>
<p><strong>Allegra: </strong>And just like the ice cream museum, they might’ve gotten there and went, “So that’s it?”</p>
<p><strong>Dylan: </strong>Yeah. “This sucks. There’s a long line and there’s nothing to do here.” Okay. So what is the state of the gravestone today? Is it still there? Can you visit it? Do people still come and see it?</p>
<p><strong>Allegra:</strong> Well, it’s definitely still there. And when I visited, I was told by the person from Trinity Church that professors from local universities will often bring their students there to explain the phenomenon of Charlotte Temple and sort of, you know, what I just talked about, what she represents about American literature, novel reading culture. But yeah, the book, you know, you’d never heard of it. It’s really not remembered at all. So people are not coming there for Charlotte’s sake and as a sort of fandom pilgrimage. Now it’s sort of a monument to, you know, literary history and the fascinating sort of forgotten tales of America’s reading culture.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan:</strong> Yeah, it is really fascinating because it represents, again, these sort of things that maybe we think of as particularly modern currents, this kind of fandom where the line between real and unreal really sort of starts to blur and the fans want it to blur in a certain way. How unique is this? Are there other fictional grave sites that have become similar cultural phenomenons?</p>
<p><strong>Allegra: </strong>Well, yeah, I mean, like, so since Charlotte Temple’s grave, there have been a bunch. I think probably the one that happened around the same time was when Little Nell died, the Charles Dickens character. There was a villager in the village that she was purported to be buried in in the book who similarly constructed a grave and I believe charged people to come see it. And then a few decades after that, the Reichenbach Falls in Switzerland, where Sherlock Holmes, you know, “died,” immediately became a spot for people to sort of travel to because of its place in literature.</p>
<p>My personal favorite, because I’m a big <em>Doctor Who</em> fan, is that in Cardiff, Wales, there’s a shrine to Ianto Jones from the <em>Doctor Who</em> spin-off <em>Torchwood</em>. So he died in, you know, in the show in this one place. And literally since 2009, there has been a quite large shrine to him in a central part of the city that is absolutely still a pilgrimage point for fans of that franchise.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan: </strong>You know, there’s something beautiful about this kind of fandom. I mean, there’s something so lovely about the idea that, like, across hundreds of years of history, this notion of, like, reading something or experiencing a story strikes you so deeply that you kind of, you know, want to actually, like, make a pilgrimage somewhere to combine your life with this imagined world, this imagined life. I mean, you are an expert on fandom. You are a fan of many different fandoms, <em>Doctor Who</em> obviously among them. What do you make of all this? How do you think about this?</p>
<p><strong>Allegra:</strong> Well, I think the most important thing is in the fact that we use the word pilgrimage to describe it, right? And that’s a much, much older word than fandom is. And it describes something, you know, sort of religious and devotional. And it connects us with people throughout history that went somewhere, you know, far from their home in order to feel connected to something bigger than themselves, something that they were passionate about.</p>
<p>So I think that is a really, I think that’s a really interesting part of it. And I think literary tourism has been a thing for hundreds of years. People were rocking up to the houses that, you know, Rousseau stayed in and the birthplace of Dante. And it’s always been a big deal to sort of get close to the thing that you love in any way that you can. And to either take something with you, whether it’s a memory or a souvenir, or even sort of leave a mark, right? You know, leave a flower or a card or some graffiti.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan: </strong>Yeah. Have you ever been to, have you ever made a pilgrimage to a fictional grave?</p>
<p><strong>Allegra:</strong> Well, I went to the grave of John Irving in the Dean Cemetery in Edinburgh, Scotland. I mean, technically he’s a real person. He was a polar explorer who died on the Franklin expedition, but he’s also a character on the show that introduced me to that bit of history. It’s a show called <em>The Terror</em>. And that show means a lot to me. So it was definitely for me a pilgrimage in the way that visiting Charlotte Temple’s grave was to her fans. It was really cool to be there.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan:</strong> Yeah. I also have not visited the grave of a fictional person, but I do think I will, when I’m in the city, I’m going to go see Charlotte Temple. And I would like, maybe I’ll read the book, try to read the book on, you know, my commutes back and forth.</p>
<p><strong>Allegra:</strong> I would love to hear how it holds up.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan: </strong>That was Allegra Rosenberg. She’s Atlas Obscura’s community editor, and you can <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/trinity-churchyard-charlotte-temple-grave">read her piece about Charlotte Temple</a> and a bunch of her other excellent pieces on the website. We will put links in the show notes and go see the grave of Charlotte Temple. The Trinity Churchyard is open to the public from 8:30 to 4. Wander in, take a look, you know, commune with the ghost of a fictional character. Go say hello.</p>

Catskill Game Farm: Explore the Ruins of America’s Once-Largest Private Zoo

<p>I wasn’t sure what to expect when I met Cathy Ballone outside the entrance of the abandoned zoo she and her husband, Ben, had recently purchased. Over the ticket kiosk in the parking lot was a sign that read “Catskill Game Farm” and, beneath it in smaller letters, “Fun for the Whole Family.” The gate we passed through still bore the shadow of the hand-painted giraffe that had once adorned it. What remained inside was a mystery.</p>
<p>I knew much had been removed after the Catskill Game Farm closed. The animals, of course, were all gone, and the amusement park rides had been auctioned off. As we passed by dozens of pens, huts, and cages, I found it hard to figure out what would constitute a “good” photograph of this place—something that would communicate its spirit. I was <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/categories/decay-theory">used to photographing the architecture of large buildings</a>, but aside from the mid-sized giraffe house and rhino enclosure, most of what remained was small and obscured by weeds.</p>
<p>As we passed a little stand that had once held a cauldron tourists could take photos of their children in, my confidence wavered. You can’t photograph what isn’t there. Cathy, a petite dynamo whose eyes sparkled with kindness and determination, told me about the plans they had for the site: a bed and breakfast, a campsite/RV park, maybe music festivals. It seemed like a tall order. Before it was abandoned, the Catskill Game Farm had grown to a staggering 914 acres, with 136 open to the public at its peak. Cathy and Ben had purchased around 200 of these acres but with no regular maintenance, the sprawling park had become overgrown. I couldn’t see how they would manage.</p>

<p>Pinning down when the Catskill Game Farm opened is harder than you might expect. Most sources say 1933, but founder Roland Lindemann <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/18834298">told</a> the <em>Tucson Daily Citizen</em> in 1959 that it was 1945. A sign in the park implies it was 1939. Maddening for a historian! What’s certain is that Lindemann began with a private collection of various species of deer on his farm in Catskill, New York. As his menagerie grew, he started selling and trading animals and eventually opened the property to paying guests. Visitors came to see bison, buffalo, yaks, llamas, alpacas, camels, antelopes, mountain lions, goats, and several exotic varieties of deer.</p>
<p>The Game Farm was located in the perfect spot for growth: it was easily accessible to visitors from New York City and neighboring states, and the Catskill region was a flourishing vacation destination that was only growing more popular in the postwar years. By 1950, it welcomed 200,000 visitors a year and hosted attractions such as dancing bears and a meadow where guests could bottle-feed free-roaming baby deer and goats. Lindemann used his success to fund conservation efforts, believing nurturing the public’s love of wildlife could inspire efforts to protect species endangered by colonialism and war. In 1958, the Department of Agriculture recognized it as the first privately owned zoo in the United States.</p>
<p>The zoo’s popularity endured into the 1980s, but as air travel became cheaper, the Catskills lost their luster as a tourist destination. In 1989 Lindemann sold the zoo to his daughter, Kathie Schultz, and her husband, Jurgen—an animal importer and exporter with ties to the “canned hunt” industry, in which animals are sold to be shot by trophy “hunters” at point blank range. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/06/nyregion/06catskill.html">The <em>New York Times</em> later reported</a> that over 150 animals from the farm had been shipped to Texas, and their fate afterwards was unclear. Other zoos stopped trading with the Catskill Game Farm. Citing “mounting financial difficulties, dropping attendance, and legal regulations," the Catskill Game Farm was closed on Columbus Day 2006. Protests erupted as many animals were sold off to hunters. Attractions were auctioned, and the park fell silent.</p>

<hr class="baseline-grid-hr" />
<p>Cathy and Ben Ballone bought the site in 2012, two years before I met them in 2014. I returned often to teach photo workshops and document their progress. At first, I didn’t know how to photograph what was, essentially, absence. Gradually, I came to realize that the subject wasn’t grand architecture, but rather the beauty of the landscape, slowly reclaiming what had once been the source of thousands of fond memories. Moss crept over a miniature golf course, its booth dappled in sunlight. A Kodak kiosk stood beside the crumbling plaster remains of the fairy-tale nursery.</p>
<p>My favorite memory from my first visit was when Cathy invited me into the Lindemanns’ old home—part office, part residence. It was falling apart, but inside were shelves of souvenirs and uniforms. The attic was treacherous, full of gaping holes, but also full of treasures: coloring books, toys, postcards, hand painted signs. Cathy warned me to stay near the stairs, but, as she poked around, she kept sharing her discoveries. Soon we were both rooting through the mess. It felt like we were uncovering something magical. Someone else who bought the property might have considered it all trash, and it was clear to me then how much the Catskill Game Farm meant to Cathy. She wanted to repurpose it for a new future, but honoring the former zoo’s past while doing so was an essential part of the process.</p>
<p>Bringing the Catskill Game Farm back to life wasn’t easy. It couldn’t—and wouldn’t—be a zoo again. It was remote, the region no longer a tourism magnet. The Ballones cleared paths and debris and opened for tent camping, chipping away at the project while Cathy continued her day job as a wedding planner. Years passed without securing the funding they needed, and I could see Cathy’s faith in their ability to complete their plan was starting to flicker. Many of the guests who attended my photo workshops confided that they wanted to see the Ballones’ vision realized, but it just seemed like too much work. I felt the same way: I cared about the Ballones, but rehabilitating even one of the buildings was a daunting and expensive task.</p>
<figure class="article-image-full-width contains-caption "><img class="article-image with-structured-caption " src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/105681/image.jpg" alt="article-image" width="auto" data-kind="article-image" /></figure>
<figure class="article-image-full-width contains-caption "><img class="article-image with-structured-caption " src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/105671/image.jpg" alt="article-image" width="auto" data-kind="article-image" /></figure>
<figure class="article-image-full-width contains-caption "><img class="article-image with-structured-caption " src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/105679/image.jpg" alt="article-image" width="auto" data-kind="article-image" /></figure>
<p>Then, seemingly out of nowhere, the Ballones secured an angel investor for the project, and work began transforming the Giraffe House into a bed and breakfast. Witnessing the rather barren building as it was transformed into a stylish inn was the best kind of surprise, and I was shocked by their progress every time I visited. Ben’s skill as a carpenter and Cathy’s knack for design were proudly displayed during a visit in 2019 as work neared completion. Guest rooms were animal-themed, and mementos of the zoo’s past were everywhere. Cathy was excited for the grand opening in 2020. Then the pandemic hit.</p>
<p>For a moment, it appeared all might be lost. But in another twist, the Ballones sold the property, turning a handsome profit and paying off their investors. Maybe, in a different timeline, they would have kept the inn and operated it themselves. But in ours, they walked away with the satisfaction of having finished what they started. <a href="https://www.theoldgamefarm.com/">The Longneck Inn</a> still welcomes guests today, and visitors can explore the Catskill Game Farm’s remains on their own.</p>
<p>Most restoration stories don’t end like this. The work is too hard. The costs are too high. Even when their ideas are beautiful, reality often wears people down. It’s easy to become cynical, to call these efforts pipe dreams to shield yourself from disappointment.</p>
<p>But I’ve learned that skepticism shouldn’t eclipse hope. Sometimes, hard work and determination really do win out. The Ballones proved all the doubters wrong. They brought something extraordinary back to life—and reminded me why I keep seeking out places like this.

<p><strong>Dylan Thuras:</strong> Hi, Johanna.</p>
<p><strong>Johanna Mayer:</strong> Hey, Dylan. I’m here with a piece of local news for you today. It is about a time capsule.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan: </strong>I love a time capsule because they’re just some wacky thing that someone comes up with and then people forget about it. And some, I don’t know, like I just, there are these funny little, these funny little things.</p>
<p><strong>Johanna: </strong>Yeah. And I also find them very sweet, almost sort of provincial. And I mean that in a good way. They’re like this extremely low tech thing that—I think it says something about our human nature that we make these things. But the time capsule that we are talking about today is not just any time capsule. It is the world’s largest time capsule. It’s in Seward, Nebraska, which is like half an hour outside of Lincoln. And as of this recording mid-July, 2025, the world’s largest time capsule has been opened.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan:</strong> What secrets from the past will it contain? What great treasures will it hold? All right. Well, I can’t wait to find out what is in the world’s largest time capsule. I’m Dylan Thuras.</p>
<p><strong>Johanna: </strong>I’m Johanna Mayer, and this is <em>Atlas Obscura</em>. We are cracking open the world’s largest time capsule.</p>

<p><strong>Dylan: </strong>Okay, so the world’s largest time capsule has been opened. What are we talking about here? Like time capsules come in a lot of shapes and sizes. You know, they can be a locked room. They can be a locked box. They can be just a little shoebox, buried in someone’s yard.</p>
<p><strong>Johanna: </strong>It is like a full-blown structure. So basically, all you can see from the ground is this giant pyramid. It’s white, made out of some sort of stone. And it’s big. I would say it’s probably about the height of two people stacked on top of each other.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan: </strong>That’s serious.</p>
<p><strong>Johanna: </strong>Honestly?</p>
<p><strong>Dylan: </strong>That’s kind of a big pyramid.</p>
<p><strong>Johanna: </strong>It’s a big pyramid. It honestly looks sort of like the entrance to some sort of cult chamber or something.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan:</strong> Yes. Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Johanna: </strong>Okay, so that’s like one level is this pyramid, which is part of the time capsule. But then beneath it is this 45-ton vault, and that is where the bulk of the time capsule resides.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan:</strong> This is a two-chambered time capsule with a—</p>
<p><strong>Johanna:</strong> It’s a multi-chambered time capsule, yes.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan:</strong> This is very <em>National Treasure</em>. Who built this? How did this come to exist?</p>
<p><strong>Johanna</strong>: Okay, so yes, that is one thing about this time capsule is that it is in the yard of the person who built it. It’s like just next to their house.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan: </strong>This is dad’s project gone wildly awry.</p>
<p><strong>Johanna:</strong> One hundred percent. So it was built by a guy named Harold Keith Davisson. I was not able to talk with Harold himself. He is dead. But I did get in touch with his daughter, and I barely caught her. She said she had been on the phone with reporters all day talking about the opening of this time capsule.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan: </strong>Oh, wow.</p>
<p><strong>Trish Davisson Johnson:</strong> My name is Trish Davisson Johnson. I live in Sioux, Nebraska, have lived here most of my life. My father put in a time capsule in 1975, and I have been the keeper of the crypt ever since.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan:</strong> This is sweet.</p>
<p><strong>Johanna:</strong> Keeper of the crypt.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan:</strong> I love that she called herself the keeper of the crypt. This is really doing her father’s memory proud. Okay, what else did she have to say about this?</p>
<p><strong>Johanna: </strong>Well, for one thing, she basically lives and breathes the time capsule.</p>
<p><strong>Trish: </strong>I actually sleep in my childhood bedroom. When you have a time capsule in the yard, you can’t very well sell the house. So we moved back in after my parents died.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan:</strong> Oh, wow. That’s like really serious dedication. Like, oh, like, wow.</p>
<p><strong>Johanna: </strong>And it is like a—I think it’s like a high-touch management job because she’s talked about how she occasionally has to shoo visitors away who are trying to climb on. Like, Seward, Nebraska is a college town, so she would occasionally—</p>
<p><strong>Dylan:</strong> Kids and drunk people love to climb a pyramid.</p>
<p><strong>Johanna: </strong>Yeah, can’t resist.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan: </strong>Of course. I would be the one being shooed away there almost definitely.</p>
<p><strong>Johanna:</strong> So Trish has been the person sort of at the helm of caring for this time capsule since her dad died. And she said that there was basically no one like him.</p>
<p><strong>Trish:</strong> You can’t really define him. He grew up in an era of poverty. He was raised by a widowed mother and had two older sisters, and he spent a lot of time scrounging for himself. He had a lot of, a lot going on in his head, and a lot of it came out. He put out a newsletter every two weeks—actually in his basement—newsletter every two weeks with a circulation up to 40,000.</p>
<p><strong>Johanna: </strong>That’s like a huge circulation. If he made that a sub-stack, he’d be rolling in it.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan:</strong> This would be his whole career. That’s amazing. The more I find out about Harold, the more I like him.</p>
<p><strong>Johanna:</strong> Yeah. So this is clearly a guy who had, like, boundless physical and mental energy. And in 1974, Harold got the idea to make this time capsule with the explicit intent to open it 50 years later on July 4th, 2025. And Trish says that he was really thinking not about people a thousand years in the future, but just about his own grandchildren, who were toddlers at the time. But he also made a point to open it up to the community, and he invited people outside of his family from the town of Seward and beyond to put stuff in the capsule. So he hired a construction company to dig this giant hole in his yard, and completed it the next year in 1975, and called it “the world’s largest time capsule.”</p>
<p><strong>Dylan:</strong> Is it actually the world’s largest time capsule? I mean, it sounds huge. But I also feel like, from what I know about Harold so far, this might be just a thing that he felt like he—</p>
<p><strong>Johanna: </strong>Potentially an exaggerator.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan:</strong> Yeah, or maybe even like, I could just say this because why not? You know?</p>
<p><strong>Johanna:</strong> Funny you should ask. This did become a whole thing. So in 1977, which is two years after just the vault portion was completed, no pyramid yet, the Guinness Book of World Records did certify Harold’s time capsule as the largest in the world. But Oglethorpe University in Atlanta, Georgia, immediately freaked out and said that their Crypt of Civilization is the largest time capsule, which is—</p>
<p><strong>Dylan: </strong>I know about this one.</p>
<p><strong>Johanna:</strong> You know about it.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan: </strong>I know about this one, yeah. It’s like from a long time ago. I think they sealed it in like the 1940s, and it’s been to be opened in some—</p>
<p><strong>Johanna:</strong> The year, like, 8,000, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan: </strong>Yeah. Which like, guys, no. No one, your time capsule is not like, too much will have happened by that time, I think.</p>
<p><strong>Johanna:</strong> The other thing is that the Crypt of Civilization is basically just like a sealed off room in a campus building. There was no, you know, no locked box or anything. It’s just a room that has not been opened. Harold argues that that therefore means it’s not a time capsule. The Guinness Book of World Records did eventually settle the argument by simply removing the time capsule category.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan: </strong>Cowards. You cowards. Take a side.</p>
<p><strong>Johanna:</strong> Yeah. But in any case, just to be extra sure, Harold went a step further and constructed the giant pyramid on top of the vault and was like, now I definitely have the world’s largest time capsule.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan:</strong> Dude. Way to go, Harold. First off, just excellent job. Really good. And now it’s open. And now it’s open as of a week ago.</p>
<p><strong>Johanna:</strong> It is.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan: </strong>This is the completion of an extremely epic arc of story. I kind of love the concept of time capsules in general. When did this start as a, like as a thing? When were people starting to be like, hey, we got to bury stuff for the future. What they’re going to want in the future is the stuff we’ve got now.</p>
<p><strong>Johanna:</strong> So the word time capsule, the phrase was coined at the 1939 World’s Fair, which took place in New York City. So for this World’s Fair, Westinghouse Corporation, which is an electronics company, developed a time capsule and they buried it 50 feet below Corona Flushing Meadows Park in Queens and set it to be open 5,000 years in the future in the year 6,939. But of course, this one in Queens from the World’s Fair is just one of many. There’s of course like Voyager 1 and 2, which were shot out into space. There’s the future—</p>
<p><strong>Dylan:</strong> Oh, right. Those are kind of like time—I never thought about them as time capsules.</p>
<p><strong>Johanna: </strong>I would think of those as time capsules.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan:</strong> And those ones will actually exist in a million or even a hundred million years.</p>
<p><strong>Johanna:</strong> Somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan:</strong> If they don’t hit something.</p>
<p><strong>Johanna: </strong>They’ll be out there somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan: </strong>They’ll be out there.</p>
<p><strong>Johanna:</strong> For someone to find.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan: </strong>I wonder how long. Anyway, go on.</p>
<p><strong>Johanna:</strong> There’s also the Future Library Project. Maybe you know about that. So this is a project where they collect an original work by a popular writer every year from—it’s from 2014 to 2114. And the works will remain unread and unpublished until 2114. And they <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/forest-of-the-future-library">grew this whole forest</a> specifically to house these works. We have <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/podcast-forest-of-the-future-library">an episode about that</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan:</strong> Yeah. Margaret Atwood has a book that’s going to be published. She’s got a work that’s for that paper from those trees, but will only be published in like 2114 and like no one can see it until then.</p>
<p><strong>Johanna: </strong>So this is obviously a thing, but like people have been doing this for much longer than the 1939 World’s Fair. Did you know about the time capsule that John Adams and Paul Revere made?</p>
<p><strong>Dylan: </strong>No, I have—is this a real thing that they did?</p>
<p><strong>Johanna: </strong>It’s real, yeah, yeah. It was discovered in 2014. It’s like a little box. They laid it within the cornerstone of the Boston Statehouse in 1795 to commemorate the building and the imminent 20th anniversary of American independence. And there were some coins in there and the seal of the Commonwealth and a silver plate.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan: </strong>This is so cute. This is like John Adams and Paul Revere like off on our little mission to sneak and hide a time capsule in the statehouse is really very charming. But they didn’t like—did they tell anybody?</p>
<p><strong>Johanna:</strong> I don’t think they told anybody about it, which I love, it’s their own little private joke.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan:</strong> That’s really nice. I just love it. There’s something very human about this. It really acknowledges that we exist in a brief moment in time. You’re trying to sort of say like this is the stuff that matters at this point in time. All right, well, so this all leads us back to the big question. What the hell was in Harold’s giant multilevel time capsule? What did this guy feel like, “All right. Here’s what I’ve got to save for the future.”</p>
<p><strong>Johanna:</strong> There was a motorcycle.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan: </strong>Cool.</p>
<p><strong>Johanna: </strong>A teal leisure suit. Very fetching.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan:</strong> Extremely cool.</p>
<p><strong>Johanna:</strong> A lot of pet rocks down there. Love that. This was the ’70s. And there was a brand new Chevy Vega car inside, like a full-on car.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan:</strong> Famously crummy car.</p>
<p><strong>Johanna:</strong> Yes. Okay, yes.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan:</strong> The Chevy Vega is like a terrible car.</p>
<p><strong>Johanna: </strong>Famously bad car, yes. But there was also about 50,000 letters that people had written. There were letters from grandparents. One family traveled all the way from Colorado for the opening. There was one young girl with her parents who came to find these recorded voice messages from members of their family that they left there. I guess they were on tapes. One man left his wedding invitation.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan: </strong>Oh, there’s like a lot of like really sentimental stuff for other people.</p>
<p><strong>Johanna:</strong> Yes. Oh, oh, yes. It was like a whole community thing. And I think that witnessing that was really moving for Trish as well.</p>
<p><strong>Trish:</strong> People are finding stories about their family that they never knew. You know, what was my mom thinking when I was born? What was going on when my dad went off to war? Who is this woman who I always saw as a very stern grandmother? Who is she playing with this little boy and talking in these glowing terms? They’re finding all sorts of things they never knew.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan: </strong>Wow. That’s really sweet. How’s Trish feeling about all of this?</p>
<p><strong>Trish: </strong>Highly emotional. It’s going to be about two weeks before I can put into words what I’m feeling. My older daughter had been down in the castle when she was a toddler with her granddad. And I was there the day they were going to close it in ’77, climbed down the ladder. And I was pregnant at that time. So I can say both my daughters were in the time capsule.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan: </strong>Yeah. There’s something just really beautiful about honoring this strange thing that her father did. I feel like in the last 10 years, I have never felt more uncertain about what the future holds. And I think there’s something about a time capsule that is like, it allows you to like, in a weird way, put your hopes and dreams and wishes for the future and kind of crystallize them. And then, you know, it’s like an act of hope that someone someday will open them up and see them and there’ll be someone to care and have that reaction and sort of visit you from the past. And so there’s something there’s something so lovely about it.</p>
<p><strong>Johanna: </strong>Totally. And I think that we as a species, humans have a lot of anxiety about disappearing one day. Change and just, you know—</p>
<p><strong>Dylan:</strong> Mortality.</p>
<p><strong>Johanna:</strong> Dying.Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan: </strong>The big change.</p>
<p><strong>Johanna: </strong>And disappearing and being forgotten is the big thing. And then I think that that manifests in many different ways, whether it’s someone wants to write a book or leave, you know, leave a mark on the place in some sort of way. And this just strikes me as such a small, simple way to achieve that.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan: </strong>Totally.</p>
<p><strong>Johanna:</strong> What would you put in? What would I put in a time capsule?</p>
<p><strong>Dylan: </strong>That’s a good question. I think I’d put in some of the books that you know, some of the <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/unique-gifts/books">Atlas books</a>, they represent big portions of my life and important milestones. I think I’d put in some Dungeons and Dragons dice and stuff like character sheets that my kids have made, you know, because it’s like a very sweet moment in my time with them.</p>
<p><strong>Johanna: </strong>I love the people who put the voice recordings in there. I’m like, I gotta do that. It makes me just want to record everyone that I love.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan: </strong>Let’s put the whole podcast in there. There’ll be 1,000 episodes of this show waiting for someone. They’re gonna be like, what is all this?</p>
<p><strong>Johanna:</strong> What a treat.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan: </strong>Well, I love this time capsule. And I love that Harold, the mission was completed. He had a dream, this wacky idea of putting a car in a hole in his yard.</p>
<p><strong>Johanna: </strong>The logistics.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan:</strong> What a thing.</p>
<p><strong>Johanna: </strong>The logistics alone.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan: </strong>And then and then like his grandkids actually did get to see it opened up. Let’s all live like Harold. This is like, I’m into this.</p>
<p><strong>Johanna: </strong>Rock on, Harold.</p>

<p><strong>Dylan Thuras:</strong> Cuba and cigars have a longer history than you might realize. Indigenous Caribbeans have been using tobacco for millennia. In the early 1800s, under Spanish colonial rule, the first cigar factories opened. And eventually in these cigar factories, you would walk in and the smell of tobacco would waft through the air. The torcedores would sit at these neat orderly desks, rolling cigar after cigar. And you would hear something maybe unexpected in these factories. While people rolled cigars, you would hear the sound of a daily news report, or maybe a poem or a novel, being read aloud. Read aloud by a person known as the reader. The cigar reader is a tradition that is still held by a handful of people, and came from this fundamentally revolutionary set of ideas. Ideas that would shape Cuba in many profound ways.</p>
<p>I’m Dylan Thuras, and this is Atlas Obscura, a celebration of the world’s strange, incredible, and wondrous places. Today, I’m talking with Eliot Stein. Eliot is a journalist, and he has traveled across the world, finding and reporting on these disappearing customs. These traditions where there are just a few people still maintaining them. Eliot chronicled this in his book, <a href="https://www.eliotstein.me/custodians-of-wonder"><em>Custodians of Wonder: Ancient Customs, Profound Traditions, and the Last People Keeping Them Alive</em></a>.</p>

<p><strong>Dylan:</strong> Hi, Eliot. Thanks for coming to the show again.</p>
<p><strong>Eliot:</strong> Thanks so much for having me, Dylan.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan:</strong> Last time, we talked about this tradition of weaving these giant Incan rope bridges out of fiber, and they cut them down and remake them every year. And so, we are moving to a different part of the world to talk about a very different tradition with a different kind of history and impact. Let’s talk about Cuban cigars. Just for a very sensory question, what does it smell like in one of those buildings?</p>
<p><strong>Eliot: </strong>It smells like damp, decomposing leaves. In autumn in the United States, when you rake leaves into a pile and set it on the street, and then maybe after a rainstorm and you’re close to it, it smells much like that. It’s sort of damp, dank, it’s stuffy, and it’s completely silent except for the noise of the reader and the sound, that kind of beautiful, cacophonous sound of these curved knives called chavetas, which are hitting a wooden table.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan:</strong> They feel like one of these things that are still made by hand. They don’t seem to have maybe been totally industrialized, at least maybe not in Cuba. And you went and saw kind of firsthand what happened in a cigar factory in Havana at La Corona. What is it like to actually visit a cigar factory in modern-day Cuba? What’s happening in there?</p>
<p><strong>Eliot:</strong> Visiting a cigar factory in modern-day Cuba, I imagine, is very similar to visiting a cigar factory in Cuba a hundred years ago. Time is a funny thing in Cuba, as anyone who’s listening and has gone to Cuba knows. But you go into these giant, hulking warehouses. The windows are sort of sealed. You don’t want these very valuable tobacco leaves to get too moist, to get too damp. And there are hundreds and hundreds of rollers called torcedores, who are rollers, sitting in what look like 19th century school desks. And they’re all facing the front of a room. And as they’re monotonously doing their choreography of roll, cut, lick, over and over and over again, they’re listening to a lector. And a lector is literally a reader. And there is an official reader in a factory, traditionally. And their job is to do just that. They read newspapers every day. They recite poetry. They read announcements to the workers. And over the history of this job, which is more than 150 years old, there have been some remarkable consequences.</p>
<p>These readers and these rollers, through their very intimate relationship, they formed some of the first trade unions in Cuba. They formed some of the first guilds. It is not an exaggeration to say we’re some of the most instrumental individuals in leading to Cuban independence against the Spanish from the 1860s to the 1890s. And then in the decades afterwards, they were fundamental in forming Cuba’s national identity. And so I didn’t know any of this before I got there, or at least before I started researching the story. But it’s, you know, everyone knows about Cuban cigars, but almost no one knows about one of the most important jobs in the cigar making process. And that’s what I went there to research and understand.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan: </strong>Almost everyone is doing this job of being a roller. You know, the vast majority of the people in this factory have a very straightforward job, which is to roll cigars. But then there is this one job, this reader, and it seems like there’s a sort of schedule of different types of readings that can happen. Maybe you could talk me through what might be read during a typical day.</p>
<p><strong>Eliot:</strong> Yeah, so one of the people that I profiled, and I met as many readers as I could in Cuba, and there aren’t that many that still exist, but one of them has a fittingly poetic name. Her name is Odalys de la Caridad Lara Reyes. Yeah, so her day starts at 6:00 a.m. She boards a bus from her home outside of Havana and gets into the office at about 7:00, 7:15. She then muffles through a stack of newspapers on her desk, which are all state-sponsored in Cuba, as everything is, and she decides what it is that she wants to read. But her day starts when the torcedoras, the rollers, arrive, and that’s at about 8:15.</p>
<p>She recites poems that she’s written for individuals celebrating their birthdays. I should say that of the 300-some rollers that she works for, she knows all of their names, she knows all of their birthdays, she knows all of their family members. So she reads announcements for them, whether it’s individuals welcoming children, individuals who have requests for moments of silence for those who have recently lost someone. She then transitions to practical advice based on topics that the workers have asked her about, and this can be everything from how to calm a screaming newborn to how to talk to your teenager about dating, you name it. It’s really at the worker’s discretion. Then at about 8:45, she segues into accounts of historical figures, which often relate to the novel that she’s reading. So for instance, when I went there, she was reading <em>The Count of Monte Cristo</em>, which happens to be one of the most popular novels that readers read and that workers love. And so while she’s reading that, she might read a profile of Joan of Arc, and then at 10:00, she turns to national and international news.</p>
<p>I asked her, in the 30 years that you’ve been doing this, what are some of the most meaningful news announcements that you’ve read to your workers? And she recalled the time in 1998 when Pope John Paul II was arriving in Cuba, and how she read this out loud, and this is how the workers discovered this, and people burst into tears. And then similarly, back in 2016, she had to announce the loss of Cuba’s titan patriarch, Fidel Castro. And similarly, the whole room just erupted in sadness. So she’s got a very full day, and then in the afternoon, she reads her novel, and by about 2:00 or 3:00 p.m., that’s when the workers shuffle out. But it’s not just a transactional kind of I read, you listen sort of relationship. And when I was shadowing her, and I’d go to her small office, which is a small desk under a mammoth poster of Fidel Castro and Che Guevara, people would come in and out for all kinds of practical advice. This is really sort of not so much a literal reader, but kind of a mother figure, a leader. And when you trace the history of this profession, that’s always how it’s been. It’s kind of a community organizer of sorts.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan:</strong> Somewhere between a one-person public radio station, and an HR department, and a leader, or a figurehead. That’s a fascinating combination of things. Why did this happen? Why did this job come to exist?</p>
<p><strong>Eliot:</strong> That’s a great question. There’s a tobacco museum in Havana, and I was talking with one of the directors in one of my first interviews, and I sort of asked that question as well. And she had a wonderful quote, which she said, “you can’t understand Cuba without understanding tobacco.” And so as a brief history lesson, Columbus arrived in 1492. He noticed that the indigenous Taino people were smoking this thing that they call tobacco, spelled with a K. And that’s how we get the name. But they rolled it into this kind of cylindrical shape. And he called it, in his journal, he called it kind of a half burnt weed. So Columbus is curious about what this is. He collects a few leaves. He sends it back to Spain, because he’s working for the Spanish. And people go absolutely nuts for it. As people who’ve never smoked tobacco before, it becomes addictive. Columbus obviously enslaves the Taino, and the rest is history. But by about the 16th century, you have Criollos, ethnically Spanish people, but who were born in Cuba. They begin farming the stuff. But the Spanish crown taxes it very, very heavily. So as a way of kind of avoiding these taxes, tobacco products reach to the far corners of the island. In the 1700s, the Spanish crown does this terrible thing where they basically say, every bit of tobacco that’s grown in Cuba, you have to sell to us at a discount. We’re going to ship it to Spain. We’re going to roll it and completely cut you out of the process. So we have the exclusive right to sell the stuff. Sometime in the early 1800s, people discover that actually, this tobacco product, it survives a transatlantic voyage much better when you roll it and when you actually form a cigar than when you ship dried leaves across the ocean. So at that point, Cubans or people living in Cuba are finally allowed to take control of this product themselves.</p>
<p>But at this time, ethnically, Cuba looked very similar to how it looks today. You have the Criollo people of Spanish descent, you have West Indians, you have people of African descent. It’s not only a melting pot of cultures, but this kind of bubbling cauldron of ideas and anger against the Spanish crown. And so in 1866, this guy named Saturnino Martinez, that history is completely forgotten, comes up with this beautiful idea. At this time, the ethnic Cubans, the Criollos are completely disenfranchised compared to the peninsulares, which are kind of the Spanish elites. Education is bad. They’re not allowed so many things. He has this idea of: while we’re doing this monotonous job for six, seven, eight hours a day, why don’t we get some person to awaken their consciousness, to increase their education, and to expand their worldview? We’re going to call them a lector, and you put them in front of the room, and they are going to read books, talk about the news. And he even created newspapers called <em>El Siglo </em>and<em> La Aurora</em>, which means the dawn, kind of as a nod to the intellectual awakening that he was hoping to inspire, so that these readers could read them.</p>
<p>And at first, these weren’t professional readers or anything like that. They would rotate from the rollers, where one person would have a turn on Monday, the next person on Tuesday, and they would just get up there and read. And obviously, not everyone knew how to read, hence the idea in itself, right? Only about 10 percent of people at this time knew how to read. So it was a pretty small pool that you’re picking from, right? One of the lovely things about the early tradition is that because every roller, every torcedor, had a certain quota that they had to hit, when it was that person’s turn to read, everyone else would chip in, make more cigars, and give it to that day’s reader so that he wouldn’t fall behind. So these people began reading, and within six months of the start of the reading, this tradition had expanded to every single cigar factory in Cuba. And to give you a sense of how many cigar factories there were at the time, in 1865, there were 500 tobacco factories in Havana alone, which is a remarkable statistic. So obviously, the seemingly quaint roll became a lightning rod for the Spanish crown. And just six months after this whole thing began, Spanish elites, the peninsulares, tried to shut it down. They tried to muzzle the reader almost as soon as it started.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan:</strong> One of the things that I think is so interesting about this is you could see this starting as, oh, this is just like kind of nice, and then evolving into kind of a political thing. But it seems to have really started from its very base as, okay, this is a way to educate and maybe even radicalize the public, the worker, about the Spanish crown, about what’s going on. I can see why the Spanish were not so excited about this.</p>
<p><strong>Eliot: </strong>For sure. In the 1800s, newspapers were sort of the front lines of reform, of change. But you know, the Saturnino Martinez who came up with this idea, he needed a literal mouthpiece to amplify the call, to amplify the change. And so this is where this came from. So six months after this starts, the Spanish crown has this insane idea where they make it illegal for Cubans to gather and to read together unless that reading is directly related to your job. So they effectively ban reading, which is …</p>
<p><strong>Dylan:</strong> Always a good sign.</p>
<p><strong>Eliot: </strong>Always a good sign. Every country wants that. That’s a huge moment in Cuban history that not many people know about. This continues through the Ten Years’ War, which is with Spain. That is a terrible, terrible decade for Cubans. It’s a mass exodus effectively. And so that leads to another fascinating part of this tradition where you basically have the birth of Florida. So you have a mass exodus from this island. These readers, these rollers, they all migrate to Key West, which at this time was a pirates’ lair. There was no one there. And within a couple of years, it becomes the largest city in Florida. So you have these radical individuals from Cuba. Basically, when the tradition stopped forcibly in Cuba, they just relocate 90 miles north to Key West. And they continue doing this, but it only gets more and more radical. They then migrate just outside of Tampa Bay to a place that still exists called Ybor City.</p>
<p>And at a certain time in the 1880s, it was actually the cigar capital of the world. They were cranking out 500 million cigars every year. And it was all Cuban exiles. You had some Italians, you had some West Indians, but it was effectively Cubans. And so long story short, when we get to Ybor City, you have some of the most pivotal individuals in the Cuban independence movement who are working there. One of the most popular things that the readers read in Ybor City was this thing called the <em>Patria</em>, which was a newspaper started by a guy named Jose Marti. Jose Marti is basically the Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, and George Washington all together of Cuba. He’s known as sort of the apostle of Cuban independence. He was born in Cuba. He was threatened with death, escaped to New York. And from New York, he creates this newspaper called <em>Patria</em>, which is all about Cuban revolution.</p>
<p>He becomes so beloved by the readers and workers that they pool their money together and invite him to come down to Florida. He makes 20 trips down to Florida between 1891 and 1894. And each time he comes, he’s accompanied by a huge entourage of lectors, of readers. And they’re the ones who introduce him. They’re the ones who basically secure his safety. They’re the ones who literally finance his trips. And he makes some of his most stirring calls for Cuban independence, including the famous Cuba Libre speech, which not only gave us a drink, but also Cuban independence from the lector’s podium in Florida. And as time evolves in 1894, not only are workers putting aside part of their wages to finance his trips, but to secure weapons for the forthcoming revolution. And these readers and workers, they go on the front lines, in the battle field, later.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan: </strong>What’s so amazing about this story is that I think everyone is sort of at least vaguely aware of the recent revolutionary history of Cuba. Of Castro, of the fight for independence, and even Cuban exiles in Florida. Like the number of weird sort of just rhyming pieces of this story that then sort of play out in some other way into the future, there’s just, I did not realize in some ways how much of the more recent history of Cuba has this kind of resonant parallel echo in this older history of Cuba.</p>
<p><strong>Eliot:</strong> Totally. And as someone who admittedly knew very, very little about Cuba, and certainly less about cigars, I mean, this was an awakening for me that—it was, you know, mesmerizing.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan: </strong>For me, it also totally changes, like—okay, yes, I associate cigars with Cuba, I associate them with Castro, but they’re kind of a prop. It feels like, okay, yeah, they’re there because it’s part of the economy and Castro smoked cigars. But in this telling of the story, or this understanding of it, obviously, tobacco, cigars, and then this space for communication within the factory, it puts them absolutely central to the story of Cuban revolution, Cuban independence, and everything, all those sort of things that would come later. So talk to me about what’s happening today. It sounds like there are a few of these readers left. I’m a little bit, if I’m honest, surprised that this wasn’t all converted over to state-run radio at some point, and there’s at least some lectors still serving.</p>
<p><strong>Eliot:</strong> Yeah, for sure. You know, once this tradition goes from Cuba to Florida, by necessity, right, because it was effectively muzzled by the Spanish, it also spreads to other places. Like, for a while, the Dominican Republic employed cigar readers. For a while, Puerto Rico did as well. Today it exists only in Cuba, and it exists in a very, very small quantity compared to what it used to. People at the state-run tobacco agency told me that in 2009, it was estimated that 250 readers remained in Cuba. Ten years later, there were just 150 of them, and today there’s just 50 left. In Havana, which, as I was saying, at one point had 500 cigar factories and every single one employed a reader, today there are just three left. And Odalys de la Caridad, she’s effectively the last reader who’s been there for a while. This is now her 33rd year of service. But yeah, to your great point, you know, in the 1930s, cigarettes became very, very popular, because industrialized cigarettes, I should say. So that replaced a lot of the demand for cigars. Then you obviously had radio that was introduced, which kind of silenced the reader even more. And so today, in a lot of the places where there used to be readers, some of the workers obviously still want them, but some of them are like, actually, could we just do 30 minutes of reggaeton on a tinny radio? And you have this once-upon-a-time tradition that has effectively created Cuba and helped create its identity that is slowly more and more and more fading away.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan: </strong>And Odalys, the reader we talked about in the beginning of this conversation, what did she tell you about what it’s like for her today as a reader?</p>
<p><strong>Eliot: </strong>She’s served 33 years, and she still works at the Corona factory, which is the largest factory in all of Cuba, and it’s located in Havana. You know, the way that she described it to me, and I should preface this by saying she was very cagey, and everyone who I talked to was very cagey, because you had this government agent right over you. And you know, my job as a journalist is not to poke and pry and push at the seams of something that is going to get someone in trouble in front of an agent. She told me a little bit about how you get this job, and it’s lovely. It’s sort of known as the only democratically elected job in Cuba. The way that it works is that, you know, you don’t post this on LinkedIn. You have a number of candidates who do trial runs by reading in front of the rollers, and they elect through a secret ballot whose voice is most pleasing, whose delivery is most inspiring, and she got the role. And she told me that over her decades of service, it’s effectively a family. She was hospitalized for a long time with coronavirus, and people came to visit her every day. This is what gives her a sense of purpose, gets her out of bed in the morning.</p>
<p>But then I met another individual who worked for even longer and was recently fired, which is almost unheard of in Cuba. You don’t easily get fired from things in an economy like Cuba. And the reason that she was fired was because she wanted to read things the way that she once was able to, but things were getting more and more and more strict. And the way that she was able to communicate this to me in front of the government agent—you know, I was asking her about what it was like to previously work there. She got quite emotional. The government agent said, let’s pause for a bit. He went outside to go smoke a cigar, of course. And then through a series of coded kind of gestures, through winking, through nodding, etc., she answered my questions and effectively let me know that she was pushed out. And this factory where she once worked no longer employs anyone for the same reasons, that it is becoming more and more strict to deliver honest information about what is happening. And that was very telling. So, you know, back to the director’s quote, she’s exactly right. You can’t tell the history of Cuba without understanding tobacco and more specifically readers.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan: </strong>Yeah. There’s lots of cultures with, you know, storytelling traditions. This one feels really distinct to the Cuban story and Cuban history. And maybe this is—some part of me holds out hope that like this tradition will reassert itself in some other, you know, freedom loving way. I don’t know what that means exactly, but there’s just a beauty to it. There’s a beauty to the tradition. And to see how deeply interwoven it has been with the entire Cuban history going back, you know, 150 plus years, you know, is just fascinating. Thank you for telling us the story, Eliot.</p>
<p><strong>Eliot: </strong>Thank you so much for having me.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan: </strong>That was Eliot Stein. He is a journalist and the author of a fantastic book, <em>Custodians of Wonder: Ancient Customs, Profound Traditions, and the Last People Keeping Them Alive</em>. Eliot has come on the show a couple of times now to talk about these traditions. So if you’re curious about them, go and listen to the episode we did previously about the Q’eswachaka, sometimes called <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/last-inca-rope-bridge-qeswachaka-tradition">the Last Incan Bridge</a>. It is an amazing tradition and one of the most incredible places I have ever been. So go check it out. We will put a link in the episode description.</p>

Redwoods Shouldn’t Be So Tall. Here’s Why They Are.

https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/untold-earth-101-redwoods
<p><em>This is a transcript of an episode of <a href="https://www.pbs.org/show/untold-earth/">Untold Earth</a>, a series from Atlas Obscura in partnership with Nature and PBS Digital Studios, which explores the seeming impossibilities behind our planet’s strangest, most unique natural wonders. From fragile, untouched ecosystems to familiar but unexplained occurrences in our own backyards, Untold Earth chases insight into natural phenomena through the voices of those who know them best.</em></p>
<p><strong>Lucy Kerhoulas:</strong> There's something really magical about redwood forests. Hanging out in a tree that you know is 2,000 years old and kind of stoically standing in one place, you kind of have to experience to be able to explain.</p>
<p><strong>Steven Mietz:</strong> There's three things that kill trees. There's bugs, there's fire, and there's disease. And this tree is adapted to fight all three of those.</p>
<p><strong>Jason Teraoka:</strong> It's the tallest tree in the world. There are species up there that only exist in the canopy, and you don't find them anywhere else in the world.</p>
<p><strong>Frankie Myers:</strong> The size alone makes you feel humble. And I think any time humans can make a connection that makes them feel humble, it fascinates us. The redwoods predate our existence on this planet by 135 million years.</p>
<p><strong>Narrator: </strong>Today, what's left of them can be found on a narrow strip along the northern Pacific coast. These mighty giants survived the age of the dinosaurs. Can they survive us?</p>
<figure class=" contains-caption "><img class="article-image with-structured-caption " src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/105964/image.jpg" alt="article-image" width="auto" data-kind="article-image" /></figure>
<p><strong>Frankie: </strong>We are on the banks of Halkikwe-Roy, the Klamath River. I'm a part of the Yurok tribe. Our home is surrounded by geese, the old-growth redwoods. We've been here as long as they've been here. We respect them because they're living beings.</p>
<p>And when they're in canoes, they're part of our family. The story that has been handed down from Yurok people talks about the redwoods as guardians. They watched out for us as a people.</p>
<p><strong>Steven: </strong>You come to this forest, you feel the calming presence coming from these ancient giant trees who are just saying, it's okay. We survived for hundreds and thousands of years, and so can you.</p>
<p>This is the place the redwoods grow the best and the biggest for two reasons. One, this coastal zone of California along the cold Pacific Ocean gets a lot of rains. It needs a lot of water. You can't grow a big tree without a lot of water. And in the summer, that cold water meets the warm air and creates a lot of fog.</p>
<p><strong>Lucy: </strong>There's physiological complications with pulling water 300 feet up against gravity.</p>
<p>The trees snag the fog, moisture out of the air. And then the fog water, it can drip down the tree and they can absorb water through their leaves, through their bark.</p>
<p>And then they can also absorb water crazily. They make roots in their crowns, like hundreds of feet above the forest floor that are growing into these crazy wet epiphyte mats and presumably uptaking water.</p>
<p><strong>Frankie: </strong>They're not just a species that takes water like most of our tree species do, but they capture cold water that helps benefit all of our trees. It's cold water that helps benefit all of our salmonid species and all of our species on the coast and inland as well.</p>
<figure class=" contains-caption "><img class="article-image with-structured-caption " src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/105961/image.jpg" alt="article-image" width="auto" data-kind="article-image" /></figure>
<p><strong>Steven: </strong>The redwood forest is like a giant superorganism because they interweave their roots and hold each other up like true friends. If one part of their friendship circle is having a little trouble, they actually can send them nutrients and water from another more healthier tree.</p>
<p>Being so tall, they're kind of vulnerable, like a skyscraper, to being pushed over in a big windstorm. The only thing that really saves them from falling over is having this interconnected root system. When the wind knocks down a tree, it actually helps the forest, right?<br /><br />It opens up the forest for light to come to the forest floor and help all the other critters and all the other vegetation that needs to grow. So a fallen redwood tree still contributes to the forest for hundreds of years.</p>
<p><strong>Frankie: </strong>Redwood tree had watched humans evolve, and redwood is the one who taught us the lessons of how we're supposed to treat one another.<br /><br />Every time I get in one of our canoes, you feel that connection. It's a good reminder that our lives are just links in a chain, and we're all connected to one another.</p>
<figure class=" contains-caption "><img class="article-image with-structured-caption " src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/105962/image.jpg" alt="article-image" width="auto" data-kind="article-image" /></figure>
<p><strong>Steven: </strong>I think the biggest threat to the redwoods today is probably just the fact that there's so few of them left. And of that old growth that's left, 45 percent is here within the boundaries of Redwood National and State Parks. And it really is a shame. We have pictures of logging trucks and trains with trunks that we can tell are bigger than the General Sherman tree, which is the current existing biggest tree in the world.<br /><br /><strong>Frankie: </strong>We lost some of those guardian trees, and some of those guardian trees are being regrown right now.</p>
<p><strong>Jason: </strong>One of the issues with our second-growth forests is that they are all one cohort. All the trees are about the same age. You don't have this multilayered canopy that you would see in old growth.</p>
<p>What we're doing is, we're coming back in and we're bringing chainsaws back into the forest to thin out these really dense second-growth forests that we have here. We're trying to redistribute growth to fewer trees to make those fewer trees more vigorous.<br /><br />So we're standing in an area that has been thinned. They're assessing how well the stand has responded to some of these restoration treatments to see how much diameter growth has occurred.</p>
<p><strong>Sam Pincus:</strong> All right, DBH of Sussy number 26. 18.9. It grew!</p>
<p>This work is really inspiring because you get to see how much the trees grow in such a short amount of time when they're given the right amount of space and light.</p>
<p>And we don't really get to see trees the way they used to grow, so coming back and remeasuring trees really makes us feel like our work is making a difference.</p>
<figure class=" contains-caption "><img class="article-image with-structured-caption " src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/105965/image.jpg" alt="article-image" width="auto" data-kind="article-image" /></figure>
<p><strong>Steven: </strong>In the future, we are concerned that we could have catastrophic wildfire, so the restoration work we're doing, thinning these second-growth forests is helping reduce the fuel load on the landscape. Hopefully we're giving these trees a chance to protect themselves.</p>
<p>Can the redwoods survive? I think they can. They're survivors. They've survived for hundreds of millions of years, and I think they can survive us as well.</p>
<p><strong>Lucy: </strong>We owe it to future generations that they can also experience these forests. We need to protect these forests for science reasons and climate reasons, but also just they're like a treasure on our planet, and they're really special.</p>
<p><strong>Frankie: </strong>They've always watched over us. They've always looked to see how we're doing. We're supposed to reciprocate that back to them in the same way that they have cared for us since the beginning of time.</p>

<p><strong>Johanna Mayer:</strong> A few weeks ago, I called my dad. I had a few questions for him. The topic is Limburger cheese.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Mayer: </strong>Oh boy. That’s a subject near and dear to my heart.</p>
<p><strong>Johanna:</strong> If you’ve never heard of Limburger, it is the OG stinky cheese. It is uncanny how much it smells like feet. But my dad loves it. And Limburger has been a big part of his life for decades. But so I was wondering, did your parents eat Limburger?</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Mayer:</strong> My mother used to make a big production out of holding her nose while my father ate it. With onions. With raw onions. Doesn’t that sound good?</p>
<p><strong>Johanna: </strong>That actually does sound good to me.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Mayer:</strong> And you had to have a beer with it. You had to have a beer with it. A beer and raw onions and good bread.</p>
<p><strong>Johanna: </strong>My dad’s parents immigrated from Germany. And I’ve always thought of Limburger as this uniquely German thing. Because my grandfather wasn’t alone in his devotion to the cheese. For a while in the late 1800s, German communities across the U.S. were teeming with Limburger. It was ultra popular. But lately, my dad’s been having trouble finding the cheese. Hasn’t been able to get his hands on it for a couple years now. And as I started looking into it, I think I figured out why. I’m Johanna Mayer and this is <em>Atlas Obscura</em>, a celebration of the world’s strange, incredible, and wondrous places. Today, we visit Chalet Cheese Cooperative in Monroe, Wisconsin. Aka, the very last cheese plant left in America that bravely makes Limburger cheese. A cheese that inspires equal parts loving and loathing. That has been banned for its assaulting smell. And that once sparked a full-on feud between two cities. And I try to find out how my dad can get his hands on some.</p>

<p><strong>Johanna: </strong>I cannot think of a cheese that has made its mark on pop culture more than Limburger. There’s a bit where The Three Stooges faint at its aroma. Mark Twain wrote a short story in which two men are traveling on a train with a box that they think is a coffin containing a rotting corpse.</p>
<p>But the box is actually full of Limburger. In a 1918 World War I comedy, Charlie Chaplin tosses a hunk of it into enemy trenches, compelling surrender. The cheese has seen some more consequential publicity too. A scientific study found that mosquitoes are equally attracted to the smell of Limburger and human feet, prompting other researchers in parts of Africa to bait mosquito traps with Limburger to fight malaria.</p>
<p>But if you manage to get past the smell and take a bite, it is an altogether different experience. I think the taste is actually pretty mild. It’s kind of creamy, a little nutty. Some might call it earthy. It’s a soft cheese. Has this orangish rind. A bacteria smear—basically just a combo of bacteria and salt water—works its way into the cheese and breaks down the fatty acids and protein. Makes it soft and imparts that unforgettable smell.</p>
<p>Limburger arrived in Wisconsin after a big wave of European immigration in the late 1800s. It’s a Belgian cheese, but it was popularized in Germany. No doubt that is where my grandfather had it for the first time. And as immigrants arrived in the United States and spread across Wisconsin, so did the demand for Limburger. Which brings us to Chalet Cheese. The plant was founded in Monroe, Wisconsin by a group of five local dairy farmers in 1885.</p>
<p>They started out making Swiss cheese, but the local workers at the plant couldn’t afford Swiss. So they started making Limburger for themselves on the side. And eventually the factory was like, hmm, seems like people might like this stuff. Maybe it’s not a bad idea to make it ourselves. And they started officially manufacturing the stinky cheese.</p>
<p>There was a lot of demand. By the 1920s, the Kraft Brothers—and that’s Kraft with a K, perhaps you recognize the name—they were pro-Limburger and teamed up with Chalet Cheese to distribute it. By the ’30s, nearly all the country’s Limburger was made in Greene County, Wisconsin, where Chalet Cheese is. And the state was producing almost 7 million pounds of it. A local train line was established to shuttle the cheese between Wisconsin and nearby cities.</p>
<p>The train was officially called the Milwaukee 508, but it was nicknamed the Limburger Express. It seemed that Limburger was on top of the world. It was flying off the shelves, getting stuffed into sandwiches alongside raw onions, and zipping off en masse to the big city on the Limburger Express. But for some, it could never quite pass the sniff test.</p>
<p>In 1935, a mail carrier in Independence, Iowa, was handling a package when he was overcome with an intense odor emanating from the parcel. Turns out the package was stuffed with Limburger. Supposedly, the cheese had been prescribed by a doctor for a patient suffering from indigestion. Personally, I have never known cheese to help with indigestion, but maybe it has something to do with the bacteria content? I don’t know. In any case, the postmaster, seeing his employee brought to his knees by the package of cheese, was furious. And he banned all shipments of Limburger.</p>
<p>When word of this decision got back to the postmaster of Monroe, Wisconsin, where Chalet Cheese is, he was livid, and he challenged the postmaster of Independence to a, “sniffing duel.” The feud became known as the Duel of Dubuque. Dubuque is the town right between Independence and Monroe, where the mysterious sniffing duel was set to take place.</p>
<p>The local newspapers jumped in and began volleying insults. The <em>Milwaukee Journal</em> published a headline that said, “Limburger: Fragrant in Monroe, Putrid in Iowa.” A week later, the local <em>Independence</em> paper ran a column blasting residents of Monroe who, “Think that the world is just a glib, flat, Limburger cheese, surrounded by an ocean of lager beer.” In the end, the Duel of Dubuque was settled peacefully when the Independence postmaster admitted that he did not, in fact, possess a sense of smell.</p>
<p>It’s honestly unclear to me, reading these old newspaper reports, how serious the Duel of Dubuque actually was. I think it was mostly a gag between the two towns, but there might have been some underlying tensions that had a more serious bent. At one point, the city of Louisville, Kentucky, banned the sale and manufacture of Limburger in the city. The local health officer called the cheese unwholesome, said it was full of microbes. He said, “In fact, animal life is what makes Limburger pleasing to the taste. I mean, to the taste of some people.”</p>
<p>Look, there is no doubt that Limburger is an objectively stinky cheese. But the words unwholesome and animal life feel pretty close to the language around how immigrants are sometimes described. That, combined with the cheese’s popularity in working class immigrant communities, like my own grandfather’s, makes me wonder if there was some sort of anti-immigrant sentiment at play.</p>
<p>A group of local Germans protested the ban in Louisville, but they weren’t successful. In any case, American tastes were beginning to change. American cheese hit the scene, and mild cheeses began to replace their stinkier, funkier counterparts. The age of refrigeration changed things, too. Limburger and its accompanying bacteria had no place in shiny, clean, new refrigerators.</p>
<p>In 1939, possibly in a last-ditch Hail Mary effort, some plants proposed a new method of manufacturing the cheese. Supposedly, it would get rid of the iconic odor. But Limburger loyalists did not like that idea.</p>
<p>The journalist and short story writer Damon Runyon wrote an editorial for a newspaper expressing his dismay: “We deem this something akin to divesting the peach of its bloom, the sunset of its golden glow, or a beautiful lady of the velvet of her lips. Of course, we would never accept any cheese under the guise of Limburger if it did not have the Limburger fragrance. We would just as soon take bouillon for beer. Limburger cheese without the Limburger would simply not be Limburger cheese at all.”</p>
<p>But Runyon and his fellow lovers of Limburger were in the minority. By the ’40s, Limburger was on a steady decline. One by one, plants that manufactured the cheese began to close. Until eventually, by the ’80s, Chalet cheese was the last Limburger standing.</p>
<p>Here’s one amazing thing about Chalet cheese: To this day, they use the same mother culture that they have had since 1885. And the methods are pretty much unchanged, too. Workers dip the mother culture into salt water and rub it into each brick of Limburger by hand with a rag. These days, they make about 500,000 pounds of it per year. And as I say all this out loud—the hundred-year-old mother culture, washing the cheese by hand, small batch production—it all makes me realize: This is an artisanal cheese. If it were wrapped in a fancy foil packet and had a name like Le Chateau de Limburg and sold for $24, and if we quit calling it stinky and instead called it funky, would we all be singing a different tune about the humble Limburger?</p>
<p>Well, there is one place that doesn’t need a rebrand to appreciate the joys and eccentricities of Limburger. And that is Monroe, Wisconsin, home of Chalet cheese. The local tavern serves a Limburger sandwich, which is one of the most popular menu items. They have a biennial cheese festival where they crown a Limburger queen. And a local market research manager says she will still occasionally get a call from someone trying to track down the cheese their dad or grandfather used to enjoy. Which is, of course, exactly what set me down this whole path.</p>
<p>My poor dad, just trying to get his hands on some stinky cheese. I got on <a href="https://chaletcheese.com/">the Chalet Cheese website</a> and clicked around, and was happy to discover that they offer a Lovin’ Limburger gift set: four 6-ounce pieces of Limburger that I could have shipped directly to my dad.</p>
<p>Except … It’s sold out! For a minute, I was bummed. But then, it actually made me kind of happy. Because I guess that means there are more Limburger lovers still standing than my dad or I ever thought.</p>
<p>To get a whiff of Limburger yourself, if you dare, you can visit the Chalet Cheese Factory Store in Monroe, Wisconsin. If you want to learn more about Limburger cheese, there is <a href="https://culturecheesemag.com/stories/the-last-limburger/">a great article by Molly McDonough in <em>Culture Magazine</em></a>, which is a perfect name for a publication about cheese.</p>

<p>It’s no surprise that Nevada’s small towns offer an abundance of local charm. But like their glitzier siblings Las Vegas and Reno, these lesser-known destinations take revelry to the next level. From Beatty to Virginia City to Battle Mountain, these fun-loving communities host celebrations that are anything but ordinary.</p>
<p>Into race cars, engineering, and feats of superhuman strength? You’ll want to check out the World Human Powered Speed Challenge. More the birdwatching type? Feast your eyes on the birds of prey at Eagles and Agriculture. High school thespian with a flair for the dramatic? Catch dinner and a show at the Lake Tahoe Shakespeare Festival.</p>
<p>So pick your passion and pack the car. More is more in the Silver State, and these nine festivals serve up local color in every possible shade.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 class="article-second-subheading-pre-rd"><em>Feel the need for speed</em></h3>
<h2 class="article-subheading-pre-rd"><a href="https://www.ihpva.org/whpsc/">World Human-Powered Speed Challenge</a></h2>
<h3 class="article-second-subheading-pre-rd">Battle Mountain, Nevada</h3>
<h3 class="article-second-subheading-pre-rd">September 7-13, 2025</h3>
<figure class=" contains-caption "><img class="article-image with-structured-caption " src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/105956/image.jpg" alt="article-image" width="auto" data-kind="article-image" /></figure>
<p>If you crossed Formula 1 with the Tour de France, you might get something like the World Human Powered Speed Challenge. Each year, designers and athletes from across the globe gather on Nevada’s State Route 305 to test the limits of their self-designed pedaled vehicles. (Think a car from “The Flintstones” but sleeker and much, much faster.) Their goal: to break the world record for human-powered speed, currently 89.59 miles per hour.</p>
<p>The annual event is presented by the International Human Powered Vehicle Association (IHPVA), an organization “dedicated to advancing the sport and science of human-powered travel.” Competitors must pass a qualifying speed test and a safety inspection to enter the race, and the competition is fierce. The aerodynamic designs themselves are captivating — all of the WHPSC’s past winners have built fully enclosed two-wheeled bikes, most of which are completely windowless and require external human handlers to start and stop. Also needed: A rider with enough muscle to cross the finish first.</p>

<p>With most of its population located around Las Vegas and Reno, Nevada boasts some of the darkest night skies in the country, making it a stargazer’s dream. That’s especially true during the new moon each September, when astronomy enthusiasts flock to Great Basin National Park for the state’s largest astronomy festival.</p>
<p>Over the course of three days and nights, Great Basin visitors can choose from an array of free events, including sky-gazing “star parties,” workshops with astrophotographers, and lectures on all things space and sky. They can also visit the research-grade 27-inch telescope at the Great Basin Observatory, which is generally not open to the public.</p>
<p>If you’re lucky enough to take part in the festival, be sure to layer up: although the park can be warm during the day, temperatures plummet overnight. You’ll also want to pack a red-light flashlight—white lights are banned at the festival to protect visitors’ enjoyment of Nevada’s most dazzling asset.</p>

<h3 class="article-second-subheading-pre-rd"><em>Ghosts with the most</em></h3>
<h2 class="article-second-subheading-pre-rd article-subheading-pre-rd"><a href="https://visitvirginiacitynv.com/events/hauntober-virginia-city/">Hauntober</a></h2>
<h2 class="article-subheading-pre-rd">Virginia City, Nevada</h2>
<h3 class="article-second-subheading-pre-rd">Entire month of October, 2025</h3>
<figure class=" contains-caption "><img class="article-image with-structured-caption " src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/105951/image.jpg" alt="article-image" width="auto" data-kind="article-image" /></figure>
<p>The population of <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/gold-ghosts-and-gin-the-curious-spirits-and-elaborate-history-of-virginia-city">Virginia City</a>, Nevada, is less than 800 people, but residents may tell you that number is deceptive: it doesn’t include the ghosts. In the mid-1800s, prospectors from around the world flocked to Virginia City, hoping to get rich off the dangerous work of mining its abundant silver and gold reserves. The glory years didn’t last long: in 1875, a major fire wiped out three-quarters of the city, and over the next decade, the precious ores began to dry up—forcing many to move on. But local lore says that some of the enterprising residents of Virginia City’s heyday still frequent its cemetery, saloons, clubs, and mansions.</p>
<p>Today, this colorful town located 12 miles south of Reno dedicates an entire month to celebrating its historically spooky past. Hauntober comes with a packed calendar of events for children and seasoned ghost-hunters alike, including after-dark audio tours of the famous Silver Terrace Cemetery, Halloween-themed trips on the historic V&amp;T Railroad, “horseless hayrides,” and an adults-only Victorian All Hallow’s Eve Ball. After an evening of exploring all the favorite haunts, spend the night in one of the town's historic inns: Some say they’re the best places to spot a ghost.</p>

<h3 class="article-second-subheading-pre-rd"><em>What happens in Beatty...</em></h3>

<p> </p>
<p>To enjoy Nevada’s quirkier side, you’ll want to pay a visit to the town of Beatty during its annual Beatty Days celebration, which features three days of offbeat events and zany competitions that you’re unlikely (read: guaranteed never) to find anywhere else on the planet.</p>
<p>Beatty Days began in the mid-1990s when locals noticed a increase in international tourists passing through to visit Death Valley National Park, and the ghost town of Rhyolite—located just outside town. To attract more motorists and promote local heritage, the town launched its annual festival featuring a lineup of now-famous signature events.</p>
<p>Chicken drop bingo? Bed racing? Yep, you’ll find it in Beatty. Root beer belching? Crack open a can and get competing. There’s also a car show, a chili cook-off, a Miss Beatty competition, and something called “pickle liquor hoot and holler” (hint: it’s only for the over-21s).</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 class="article-second-subheading-pre-rd"><em>A festival of sound and color</em></h3>

<h2 class="article-subheading-pre-rd">Pahrump, Nevada</h2>
<h3 class="article-second-subheading-pre-rd">November 21 - 23, 2025</h3>
<figure class=" contains-caption "><img class="article-image with-structured-caption " src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/105958/image.jpg" alt="article-image" width="auto" data-kind="article-image" /></figure>
<p> </p>
<p>Until the late 19th century, the Mohave-desert town of Pahrump—situated near Nevada’s southern tip, just a tumbleweed’s roll from the California border—was home to the Western Shoshone and Paiute peoples. Each November, their traditions take center stage at the Pahrump Social Powwow, a weekend-long feast of sound, color, and pageantry held on a 35-acre park in the heart of town.</p>
<p>Festivities begin with the “Grand Entry,” a procession of dancers in traditional Native regalia (think Olympic opening ceremony, but twice as colorful). From there, it’s three days of drumming, storytelling, and traditional dance. Visitors can wander between booths piled high with Native American crafts, or refuel with traditional bites before heading back to the arena.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 class="article-second-subheading-pre-rd"><em>Celebrate the cowboy arts</em></h3>
<h2 class="article-subheading-pre-rd"><a href="https://www.nationalcowboypoetrygathering.org/">National Cowboy Poetry Gathering</a></h2>

<p> </p>
<p>If your understanding of cowboy culture begins and ends with John Wayne movies, Elko would like to set you straight. This northeastern Nevada town—situated along the <a href="https://travelnevada.com/road-trips/cowboy-corridor/">Cowboy Corridor</a>—is home to cultural landmarks like the Cowboy Arts and Gear Museum and the Western Folklife Center, both dedicated to preserving the culture and traditions of the American West.</p>
<p>It’s in that spirit that the Western Folklife Center hosts its annual National Cowboy Poetry Gathering, held each winter. Don’t let the name lead you astray: There’s way more than poetry to be experienced here. The weeklong event features lectures, readings, film screenings, exhibitions, and open-mic sessions, all designed to honor the creativity of the West’s diverse cultures. Visitors can even enroll in workshops ranging from rawhide braiding to banjo picking to clay-pot cooking. Yeehaw!</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p>With the winter holidays in the rearview mirror, the first weeks of the year can feel like a slow, gray slog. However, that’s not the case in Ely, home of the Fire and Ice Festival, which is held each year over the Martin Luther King Jr. Day weekend.</p>
<p>The festival began in 2003 as an ice sculpting competition, and weather permitting, that event continues at Fire and Ice today. Sculptors receive three days to turn heaps of snow on Cave Lake State Park into works of art, which are then ceremonially melted after the judge names a winner. The event also sees a variety of winter-themed events, including cross-country skiing, snow bowling, ice golf, and ice horseshoes. But the festival’s signature event is the heart-pounding fireworks display launched from a moving Northern Nevada Railway train.</p>

<p>December until February is calving season in Carson Valley, Nevada, the bucolic landscape nestled along the Sierra Nevada mountains. And with the calves comes the valley’s favorite seasonal visitor: the raptors. Attracted by bovine afterbirth, bald eagles and gold eagles make a temporary home in the Silver State for just a few months before migrating onwards to places like Alaska and Canada.</p>
<p>To celebrate the birds’ annual return, Carson Valley hosts its four-day Eagles and Agriculture festival, showcasing the beauty of the landscape and the magnificence of the local wildlife. Attendees have the opportunity to tour ranches and barns to view birds of prey and other animals up close. Meanwhile, a series of workshops and photo exhibitions caters to amateur wildlife photographers looking to hone their craft. Visitors can also purchase tickets to a Falconers’ Dinner, attended by area falconers and, of course, their beloved birds.</p>

<p>It’s not hard to enjoy the scenery on the glittering shores of Lake Tahoe. But for over fifty years, Lake Tahoe Shakespeare Festival has turned Nevada’s spectacular Sand Harbor State Park into one of the country’s most captivating performance venues. Each summer, the festival presents mainstage productions of Shakespeare plays and modern classics, plus a wide roster of performances, including symphonies music, dance, and tribute bands. Visitors dine in the open air at Shakespeare’s Kitchen restaurant.</p>

<p><strong>Dylan Thuras: </strong>So, my guest today, you could describe her as a travel writer. She’s certainly not one in the conventional sense. Her books do not contain any restaurant recommendations, no cafes in Paris or walking tours of New York. But if you do want to know about the vet clinic treating donkeys in Fez, or the origami lab, where a professional paper folder creates elaborate little creatures, writer Susan Orlean is a pretty good travel guide.</p>
<p><strong>Susan Orlean:</strong> I’m a terrible tourist. You know, I get somewhere, if I’m a tourist, and I feel like, well, what am I supposed to be doing? I guess, I’m not sure. You know, I get somewhere, if I’m a tourist, and I feel like, well, what am I supposed to be doing? I don’t get it. When I’m traveling for a story, I’m on a mission. I’m looking for something, and I’m pursuing something, and it makes the trip so much more interesting.</p>
<p>I’m Dylan Thuras, and this is <em>Atlas Obscura</em>, a celebration of the world’s strange, incredible, and wondrous places. And Susan Orlean has an eye for strange, wonderful, and incredible places. She has this way of digging and digging until she finds a detail that makes you see a place in a totally new way. She’s also sort of answering the question about why we live the way we do. Susan has traveled all over the world searching for stories, and today she is taking us to a few of the places that helped shape her work and her life. She talks about throwing out the guidebook, letting herself find whatever it is that is waiting out there for her.</p>

<p><strong>Dylan: </strong>You did not grow up gallivanting around the world. I think we both share Midwestern roots. What was your sort of life like as a kid? Where were you growing up?</p>
<p><strong>Susan: </strong>My parents didn’t put us in the back of a van and move to Morocco and travel with us through Africa. We did a lot of more traditional, conventional family vacations to warm places, to the Caribbean, to Florida, to Hawaii, not so much adventuring around the world. Then I began traveling, both for my own curiosity, but then really traveling a lot for stories.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan:</strong> Today, we are talking about a couple of places that have kind of defined the way you move through the world, and one place in particular was the library. You even wrote a book called <a href="https://www.susanorlean.com/author/books/the-library-book/"><em>The Library Book</em></a>, all about the Los Angeles Public Library, which was destroyed in a fire. What role has the library played in your life, both as a kid and as something that you’ve returned to as a writer?</p>
<p><strong>Susan:</strong> I grew up almost walking distance from a branch library in my suburb in Cleveland. My parents were great library supporters and users, and from the time I was very young, my mom took us to the library several times a week. Those trips really were magical, and it was because, in the library, I could have anything I wanted. It was all free. There were no limits. And for a kid, that is an intoxicating experience. You go to a toy store with your parents, or a bookstore, your mom might say, “You pick one book or pick two books, that’s it.” You go to the library, and you come with eight books. And in fact, a lot of parents are very pleased because they feel like, “Well, this is a sign that my kid loves books and loves reading.” So you’re almost rewarded for your greediness, in a way that most of childhood is about being told what you can’t do. The library, then, is the sort of sacred place of possibility.</p>
<p>I see one’s relationship to libraries as often having many different stages. Then I had my own child, and suddenly, I was taking my little son to the library. And then, when I moved to Los Angeles, I was given a tour of the downtown library, which is a really exceptional building. It’s built in the 1920s, it’s very eccentric, it’s very beautiful, and I just immediately fell in love with it architecturally. On that tour, I also found out that there had been a terrible fire at this library, which was something I knew nothing about. Turned out it was the largest library fire in American history, 400,000 books were destroyed, 700,000 were damaged. So, the minute I heard this—and also marveled at the fact that I had never heard of it before, this took place in 1986.</p>
<p>And, of course, I found out later why that was, why this fire, which was such a profoundly damaging event, had managed to go somewhat unnoticed, and it was because it occurred on the same day as the Chernobyl meltdown. And I spent the next close to seven years researching and writing about that fire, about the history of library fires. I mean, as soon as we began building libraries, we began burning libraries as well. So, you would not go to the trouble of burning a library unless you felt it was a very important place.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan:</strong> And if I’m not mistaken, in researching this book, you performed kind of the ultimate writer’s sacrilege. You yourself burned some books as research. Am I right about that?</p>
<p><strong>Susan:</strong> You know, I felt I had to. It was really funny. Here I was writing about the burning of 400,000 books. It occurred to me that I had never seen a book burn. I’ve seen newspapers burn, and I thought, well, I think, in the interest of accuracy, I really should burn a book so that I know what it looks like, and so I can describe it vividly. For my book, back in the 1600s, if a book burned, that might be the one and only copy. If I burn a paperback book, I can go buy another one for $17. Still—and this, I found really fascinating—still, it is a taboo. You know, nobody burns a book for a good reason. Many of us are very familiar with scenes from the beginning of the Nazi era in Germany of huge bonfires of books that were considered suppressive and written by people who were out of favor with the Nazi regime. So our association is with all the most negative impulses of human nature, which is to keep people from a certain kind of knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan: </strong>What book did you choose to burn? Like, how did you choose the book?</p>
<p><strong>Susan:</strong> Well, it was very tough. At first, I thought I would burn a book that I didn’t like, and then I felt like that was really mean, that it felt really evil to take a book I didn’t like and burn it. So I thought, well, I’ll burn one that I like, because it won’t have so much hostile kind of energy. And then I thought, but I don’t want to burn a book I like. That seems really almost worse. So I thought, well, I have a lot of copies of my own books. I’ll burn one of those. And then I thought, well, wait, I don’t want to burn one of my books. That’s really creepy. So I said to my husband, you know, I thought this was a great idea, but I can’t do it. I just feel too weird. And one day he came home and he was smiling, and he said, “well, I found the book for you to burn.” I said, “all right.” And he had a bag. He opened the bag and took out a copy of <em>Fahrenheit 451</em>. And he said, “here you go.” And I thought, well, of course. And not only was it topically appropriate, but coincidentally—and I didn’t know that until I began doing more work on my book—Ray Bradbury wrote many of his books sitting in the LA Public Library, the library that I was talking about in the book. And he was very involved in helping raise the money to replace all the books that were burned. I thought Ray Bradbury, who wrote a book about book burning, would appreciate someone writing a book about book burning in the real world, who is burning his book for the book about book burning.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan:</strong> I think that’s right. I think that that is a very good choice.</p>
<p><strong>Susan:</strong> It was very meta, very meta.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan:</strong> You know, the beauty of the library is that it is this shared communal experience. We’ve all been to a library. But the second place that really shaped Susan’s life and her thoughts about travel is a little bit more remote, a little bit harder to get to than a library, and perhaps harder to find on a map.</p>
<p><strong>Susan: </strong>Well, I will say that before I went to Bhutan, I would not have been able to find it on a map. I’m not sure I’d even heard of it. I mean, I’m embarrassed to say that, but it’s a tiny country. It has fewer than a million people. This was in, let’s say, 1999 or 2000, when there was very, very little tourism in Bhutan. I believe they capped it at 2,000 visitors a year. There were no hotels. It’s now in a very different state of accessibility. But back then, it was a place people rarely went. I happened upon an ad, and it said, “Fertility Tour.” I love stumbling across a strange headline, and I would say that counted as a strange headline. And it said, You know, we will attend all these festivals and visit these different shrines. And in small print, it said, “It is not required for you to have a baby.” And you know, I just thought, “This is catnip.” I mean, come on.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan: </strong>What’s going on here? What is going to happen? Who’s on this trip? Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Susan: </strong>I’ve got to do this trip. Yeah. So I signed up as quickly as I could, and the minute I learned a little bit about Bhutan, I knew that I was going somewhere very special. It is the only Buddhist nation in the world. It’s now famous for, among other things, their national motto, and fixation is called Gross National Happiness. Their main concern is, how can we make the people of Bhutan happier? It is stunningly beautiful in the Himalaya Mountains, and really unspoiled, truly unspoiled. It’s just extraordinary. I had never been anywhere that beautiful in my life.</p>
<p>It also is a country that, besides its fixation on happiness, has this supercharged interest in fertility. And the most important iconography in Bhutan is that of an erect penis. These are painted … it’s almost like in Pennsylvania, you see hex signs painted on people’s barns. This was everywhere in Bhutan. Everywhere. And nobody thinks it’s pornographic. It’s like, well, this is how fertility happens, and we’re celebrating it. There are a lot of stone phalluses everywhere, wooden phalluses. You come from a culture like the United States, where there’s a lot of priggishness about genitalia and sexuality. And it’s like, you cannot believe it.</p>
<p>At that time, they didn’t have the internet, they didn’t have American movies. They had very little Western influence. So, you felt like you were seeing a country that truly was an intact cultural and social entity. And it was just an enormous relief from being confronted with the sort of detritus of American culture everywhere you go in the world.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan: </strong>Bhutan, obviously, it romanced you in all of these ways you’re describing. But it also came in a very particular moment in your life where—it’s sort of this thing that happens to people sometimes, when they travel, these moments of kind of conversion to a new way of being kind of happened to you.</p>
<p><strong>Susan: </strong>I had originally planned to do this trip with my husband, and we ended up getting separated right before I left on the trip. So there was a lot of poignancy and heartbreak for me going on this trip that I imagined going on with him, and imagined that even though I was there to write the story, I was also doing these fertility rituals for real, because we had begun thinking about starting a family. And then I had what I feel everyone should have at one point in their life, which is, I had a travel romance, and many people have a travel romance, and they’re quite aware that it’s a travel romance, and that it’s specific to a time and a place. I actually thought, no, this is like now my future partner, and we will split our time between Manhattan and Bhutan. I was very caught up in this kind of fever dream of this new life, and we ended up parting ways, which broke my heart at the time.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan: </strong>I’m curious about how that trip and, honestly, how all that—you’ve spent so much time, sort of, in the field doing pretty deep investigative journalism, spending lots of time with your subjects. How has that all shaped your sense of travel? You’ve talked about this idea of getting lost. I’m curious about how you think about travel now, having done so much of it.</p>
<p><strong>Susan:</strong> I hate preparing for travel, and it’s funny. My husband and I are very different that way. Like, he likes to read about where we’re going and buy a bunch of guidebooks and be prepared. And I feel like I can’t see things if I’m prepared, because if I’m prepared, then what I’m looking for is just confirmation bias. I’m just looking for the things that I was told I should look for. I would rather waste a certain amount of time, missing the highlights in exchange for just truly being somewhere new and being surprised by it, and being a little lost. I just compare it always to, like, an outward bound trip where you’re given a match and you know, maybe a blanket, and then you’re told, “Figure it out.” And to me, what’s interesting is the figuring it out. And it is often, initially, at least, uncomfortable.</p>
<p>I’m not saying you have to be somewhere exotic. I remember doing a story about Midland, Texas, when George W. Bush was running for president. He made this big point of saying, like, “If you want to know who I am, you need to know Midland, because I am Midland, Texas.” And so I said to <em>The New Yorker</em>, “Well, I want to go to Midland, Texas.” You know, I arrived there, and I was completely unprepared on purpose. I felt like I needed to be like the person landing behind enemy lines in the middle of the war, and I’ve got to find the hostiles and the friendlies, and claw my way to understanding, and I had a fantastic trip.</p>
<p>In the beginning, I thought, “What the hell am I doing?” And I just found a coffee shop, and it turned out to be kind of a cool coffee shop. And at some point, a guy was sitting there, and we started chatting. And he said to me, “Oh, well, I’ll show you Midland. I’ve lived here my whole life, and I kind of know the way it works.” And off we went, and then I stopped in a realtor’s open house and started chatting with the realtor to say, “What’s selling? What’s not selling? What are people looking for in Midland, Texas?” So I had to really see it and really be there, and not say, “Oh, Well, I think you’re supposed to go to the Midland Museum and the Midland, blah blah.”</p>
<p>My purpose was to try to describe the character of the city. A normal tourist might not feel like they want to go to a realtor open house, although I have to tell you, it’s quite interesting to see the way people live in different cities. It’s really fun.</p>
<p>I travel that way, even when I’m traveling for fun. I feel like the way I’ve traveled for work has completely influenced the way I travel for pleasure. I sometimes even enjoy having a little secret, kind of mission. One year when I went to France, I thought I just ... I’m on a goat cheese trip. I just want to try as many kinds of goat cheese as I can, and it was a really fun way to be in France. I can, and it was a really fun way to be in France. To be in France. One time I went back to France, and I just wanted to buy beautiful lingerie. Again, you know, France is very big in lingerie, and it became a really fun way to see a different part of France that wouldn’t be in the guidebook—and I loved it.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan: </strong>Well, Susan, what a joy to talk to you. What a joy it is to read your writing. You are just someone whose verve and, and curiosity for the world is so evident on the page and just fills you with that same sense. It’s been lovely to get to chat with you.</p>
<p><strong>Susan: </strong>Well, thank you so much. This has just been a real treat for me, and I hope we’ll do it again.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan: </strong>Susan Orlean is the author of <em>The Library Book</em>, <a href="https://www.susanorlean.com/author/books/the-orchid-thief/"><em>The Orchid Thief</em></a>, and so many other great books.

<p>When you find yourself in the farthest corners of the world, the unexpected is always part of the adventure. A river might rise overnight in the jungle. A trek in the desert could become treacherous in a sandstorm. A rare bird or animal might make an appearance. But being further afield often increases the risk during emergencies—so it’s important to understand how you would get to the nearest medical facility in an emergency (and understand those facilities may not be what you are used to at home).</p>
<p>Most travel insurance policies include medical evacuation to the “nearest adequate” facility for emergency treatment, but what’s “adequate” is determined by the insurance provider (and may not be acceptable to you). Medjet is a top-of-the-line medical transport membership program that gets you moved to a hospital <em data-stringify-type="italic">at home</em>. If you are hospitalized while traveling (abroad or domestically) <a class="c-link c-link--underline" href="https://medjetassist.com/medjetassist" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://medjetassist.com/medjetassist" data-sk="tooltip_parent">Medjet</a> arranges and pays all costs for air medical transport to a hospital of your choice in your home country. You can also add security and crisis response benefits if you’re going someplace where safety is a concern. The company’s <a class="c-link c-link--underline" href="https://medjetassist.com/medjethorizon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://medjetassist.com/medjethorizon" data-sk="tooltip_parent">MedjetHorizon</a> membership adds access to 24/7 expert security teams, with on-the-ground response and security extraction if necessary.</p>
<p>Traveling to remote places is incredibly rewarding but it does require extra preparation. With the right insurance and additional coverages like Medjet lined up, you’ll have the peace of mind to embrace the unknown—like these magnificently off-grid wonders.</p>

<h2 class="article-second-subheading-pre-rd article-subheading-pre-rd"><a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/cerro-fitz-roy">Cerro Fitz Roy</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/things-to-do/argentina">Argentina</a></p>
<p>The jagged spires of Cerro Fitz Roy rise high above the Southern Patagonian Ice Field. This granite monolith is Patagonia’s most recognizable peak (thanks in part to its immortalization on the Patagonia company logo). It’s also among the most treacherous. Sudden storms sweep in without warning, thawing permafrost creates hazards from loose rocks, and steep ascents make the hike tough for anyone faint of heart. Winding trails circle the peak through remote glacial valleys, windy ridges, and diverse landscapes. This feels like an expedition at the end of the earth, whether you opt for a day hike or a multi-day through hike itinerary.</p>
<figure class=" contains-caption "><img class="article-image with-structured-caption " src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/105937/image.jpg" alt="article-image" width="auto" data-kind="article-image" /></figure>
<h2 class="article-subheading-pre-rd"><a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/semliki-safari-lodge">Semliki Safari Lodge</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/things-to-do/uganda">Uganda</a></p>
<p>Uganda’s Western Rift valley is home to Semliki, 200 square miles of the country’s oldest protected area, surrounded by a wilderness where rainforest and savannah meet. Semliki Safari Lodge blends into the wild thanks to the natural local materials that make up its open-air design, thatched roof glamping tents, and verandas with panoramic views across the horizon. Guests share the valley with monkeys, baboons, forest elephants, hyenas, and pygmy hippos. Hundreds of bird species fill the canopies. One of the reserve’s star species are its chimpanzees, which are less habituated than troops in the neighboring Kibale, Budongo, and Kyambura Gorge forests. Unlike the more crowded areas in Uganda, Semliki feels like a wild frontier of rainforest, dry savannah grasslands, and riparian woodlands, where you can look out towards the Rwenzori Mountains and even spot the Congo’s Blue Mountains on a clear day.</p>
<figure class=" contains-caption "><img class="article-image with-structured-caption " src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/105940/image.jpg" alt="article-image" width="auto" data-kind="article-image" /></figure>

<p><a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/things-to-do/cambodia">Cambodia </a></p>
<p>Few ruins in the world feel as haunted by nature as Ta Prohm. This sprawling Buddhist temple was built in 1186 as a dedication to the mother of Jayavarman VII, but today its stone corridors have been surrendered to the jungle. Roots of silk cotton and strangler fig trees snake over walls and weave through the temple’s loose heavy stones— some weighing more than a ton. The result is an otherworldly fight between architecture and nature so mesmerizing it served as the setting for the movie <em>Lara Croft: Tomb Raider</em>. Ta Prohm is part of the Angkor complex and was named a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1992. Most importantly, it stands as a reminder that nature can never be fully tamed.</p>
<figure class=" contains-caption "><img class="article-image with-structured-caption " src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/105939/image.jpg" alt="article-image" width="auto" data-kind="article-image" /></figure>
<h2 class="article-subheading-pre-rd"><a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/berthas-beach">Bertha’s Beach</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/things-to-do/falkland-islands">Falkland Islands</a></p>
<p>On a lonely stretch of the Falklands called Bertha’s Beach, 300 miles east of the South American mainland, Gentoo penguins waddle year-round through the sand, joined seasonally by their Magellanic penguin cousins. South American terns, ruddy-headed geese, and endemic Falkland flightless steamer ducks all call Bertha’s Beach home, earning this area status as both a Ramsar Wetland and an Important Bird Area. It’s tough to picture today, but the island’s story as a travel destination began with disaster—specifically, the wreck of the 500-ton ship Bertha in 1892. The ship may be gone, but some of its cedar log cargo can still be found around the beach today.</p>
<figure class=" contains-caption "><img class="article-image with-structured-caption " src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/105941/image.jpg" alt="article-image" width="auto" data-kind="article-image" /></figure>

<p><a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/things-to-do/ireland">Ireland</a></p>
<p>Ireland’s northernmost island is an uninhabited, treeless spec set in the rough and wild North Atlantic Ocean. Inishtrahull once supported a small but dedicated fishing community, which built the lighthouse in 1813. By 1911, the island’s population peaked at 80 residents, then fell back to just one soul in 1929: the lighthouse keeper. The 1950s brought a newer lighthouse with automation, marking the end of human civilization on Inishtrahull. Today, the island belongs to a variety of seabirds and seals. You can still see remains of civilization here in the form of stone cottages, an abandoned school, and of course, Ireland’s northernmost lighthouse, eight miles off the coast of Donegal.</p>
<figure class=" contains-caption "><img class="article-image with-structured-caption " src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/105942/image.jpg" alt="article-image" width="auto" data-kind="article-image" /></figure>

<p><a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/things-to-do/new-zealand">New Zealand</a></p>
<p>On Campbell Island, gales rage more than 100 days a year and rain falls for 325 days annually, making it inhospitable for plenty of plant life. One lone Sitka spruce stands out in this subantarctic landscape over 400 miles from the South Island. The spruce, which is native to the northern hemisphere, was planted on New Zealand’s southernmost island over a century ago by then-governor Lord Ranfurly. Instead of growing into the classic conifer shape, the spruce has spread into the profile of a 30-foot cauliflower. (On the plus side, it’s grown up to ten times faster than it would under normal conditions.) There isn’t another tree for 170 miles, earning this botanical anomaly the title of “World’s Loneliest Tree.”</p>
<figure class=" contains-caption "><img class="article-image with-structured-caption " src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/105943/image.jpg" alt="article-image" width="auto" data-kind="article-image" /></figure>

<p><a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/things-to-do/turkmenistan">Turkmenistan</a></p>
<p>Deep in the Karakum Desert in Turkmenistan, a 230-foot-wide crater has burned for over 50 years, its glow visible for miles. The so-called Gates of Hell opened during a Soviet drilling accident in 1971, which punctured an underground natural gas cavern. To stop a potential environmental disaster so close to the village of Darvaza, the Soviets set it ablaze with the expectation that it would burn out eventually. Instead, it’s still burning today, making it one of the world’s hottest, strangest eternal flames.</p>
<figure class=" contains-caption "><img class="article-image with-structured-caption " src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/105944/image.jpg" alt="article-image" width="auto" data-kind="article-image" /></figure>

<p><a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/things-to-do/vietnam">Vietnam</a></p>
<p>Tucked into the mountains of Quang Nam, My Son Sanctuary is a crumbling city of brick towers that once formed the religious and political core of the Cham civilization. From the 4th to 13th centuries, this was the heart of an Indian-Hindu kingdom. Today, My Son Sanctuary showcases its remains, including its 71 holy temples built over ten centuries. The Cham’s seamless, mortarless, well-preserved brickwork has survived 15 centuries later, baffling engineers and earning it a spot on the UNESCO World Heritage list since 1999. It’s a captivating time capsule of a unique, extinct culture.</p>

<p><strong>Dylan Thuras:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It’s a hot day in New York City. It’s pushing 90 degrees outside, and you need lunch. So you’ve come to Harlem, to 110th Street, and you’re here for a reason. You are in search of a particular store that sells a very particular sandwich.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you didn’t know what you were looking for, you’d probably just pass it by. It’s a deli, something you’d find on, you know, basically every block in New York. But this is not just any deli. This one is called Hajji’s, and it claims to have invented the very sandwich that you seek.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So you walk inside. The AC is blasting, it is exquisite. And second, you notice that it is absolutely bustling in here. You have walked into the middle of the lunch rush. There are 10 customers crammed all around you in this tiny store, ordering sandwiches. And beyond that, there is one pervasive sound.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is what you’ve come here for, because this is the sound of a chopped cheese sandwich coming to life. Ground beef, melted cheese, chopped up on a flat-top grill. Maybe you add lettuce, tomato, some onion, some ketchup, some mayo. You put it on a roll, and you have found heaven.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I mean, it sounds simple, I guess. It is kind of a cheeseburger, all chopped up. It seems like, what is there even to say? But I cannot think of another sandwich out there that has become such an unbelievable cultural lightning rod.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m Dylan Thuras, and this is</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Atlas Obscura</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a celebration of the world’s strange, incredible, and wondrous places. This episode was produced in partnership with New York City Tourism. Today, we’re getting very close, and very personal, with a chopped cheese sandwich. It is a sandwich so storied, you might even call it a kind of a folk sandwich. And we will look at the bodega and deli culture that brought this heroic sandwich to life.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Dylan:</strong> So, here is the apocryphal story of how the chopped cheese was invented. It was here at Hajji’s Deli at 110th Street in Harlem when a cook produced the first sandwich.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One story goes that a cook was asked to make a Philly cheesesteak and improvised with the ingredients that they had on hand. I like this story, that seems plausible. Another says that a cook ran out of circular burger buns, so chopped up a cheeseburger to fit a hero roll instead. Maybe. And yet another version says that the cook—this is my favorite—had dental issues, and he was just trying to make a sandwich that was easier to chew. That’s a good one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whatever the true story is, the chopped cheese was born. Also, you can call it a chop cheese. Chopped cheese, chop cheese, same thing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m going to go and just say right up front here: We don’t know. We have no idea. The origins of sandwiches turn out to be extremely murky. But generally, people agree that this sandwich originated somewhere uptown in some deli, some bodega, sometime around the late ’90s, maybe early 2000s.</span></p>
<p><strong>Jeremy Batista: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was very young. I think I was like maybe 12 or 13, first time I ate a chopped cheese, that’s 2002, 2003. And I had it at her store.</span></p>
<p><strong>Dylan:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This is Jeremy Batista. He’s lived in the Bronx his entire life. And the store that he is talking about is his mom’s bodega.</span></p>
<p><strong>Jeremy:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It was an order that she messed up, I believe it was. And she was like, “Yo, here, just have this. I don’t want to throw it away.” My mom hates throwing away stuff. So I ate it. I was like, oh man, this is incredible. It was one of my favorite things.</span></p>
<p><strong>Dylan:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Chopped cheese quickly became a deli and bodega staple. It’s pretty cheap. It is reliably delicious. It is simple. And what’s not to like? But New York is a big place. And in fact, even just within the boroughs, the chopped cheese is kind of like a regional thing.</span></p>
<p><strong>Jeremy: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, trust me, there’s people who come to me all the time and is like, “I lived in New York my entire life, and I’ve never had a chopped cheese.” So it’s crazy that they come to me, and they’re like 40 years old, and they’re just discovering the chopped cheese.</span></p>
<p><strong>Dylan: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few years ago, it seemed kind of like, it became like a thing. Everyone was like, ooh, discovering the sandwich. Well, I mean, the internet discovered it is what happened. The sandwich struck a kind of chord. Media companies sent reporters to make chopped cheese videos. There’s a recipe for it on </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New York Times</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cooking section. Anthony Bourdain ate one in an episode of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parts Unknown</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then you know what happened next. An Upper West Side restaurant caused an absolute uproar when they planned to sell the sandwich for 15 bucks, a pricey version of the chopped cheese, a very potent symbol of gentrification.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There have been many, many heated internet debates about this. You go down the rabbit hole if you want. It is so deep. But the controversy of the chopped cheese aside, like with a lot of food origin stories, the real story is the rich culture and history that gave birth to this sandwich: The corner store culture, which it came from.</span></p>
<p><strong>Anibal Arocho:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Bodegas are the anchors of your neighborhood. They are the place that is a constant in a city that’s full of change.</span></p>
<p><strong>Dylan:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This is Anibal Arocho.</span></p>
<p><strong>Anibal:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Whether that’s demographic change, economic change, social change, you can count on finding a bodega where you know you can get something to drink, you can get something decent to eat at a relatively cheap price, and any random things that you might need for your apartment, whether that’s batteries or a set of headphones or last-minute gifts, you can find them in the bodega.</span></p>
<p><strong>Dylan: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anibal comes from a long line of bodega owners, and he even grew up above his family’s bodega. The store was on the first floor. His family lived on the second story.</span></p>
<p><strong>Anibal: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">I remember distinctly sitting on the deli refrigerator with my legs dangling there and just looking at all the people come and go. They were known for their sandwiches. This is like pre-chopped cheese. This bodega didn’t have a grill or anything like that, but the thing that my grandfather was known for was he would make pernil, so traditional Puerto Rican seasoned pork shoulder, like roasted pork shoulder, and they would cure their own Virginia hams and things like that and do stuff. For the holidays, they would roast a whole pig in the back of the bodega kitchen area, which was pretty cool.</span></p>
<p><strong>Dylan: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">You know that’s a good bodega. If you walk into the bodega and there is a whole pig roasting in the back, that’s a good bodega. Side note, maybe you have noticed that I’ve been going back and forth between saying deli and bodega, maybe corner store. They’re not exactly the same thing. Traditionally, bodegas are Latino-owned, but everyone we talked to for this episode said, you can say whatever you want, deli, bodega, corner store, you know when you see it. What is clear is that the first bodegas originated with Puerto Rican immigration to New York City, people like Anibal’s ancestors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides having grown up above his family’s bodega, Anibal is also the library manager at the Center for Puerto Rican Studies Library and Archives, or the Centro. He says the earliest documented bodegas in the city started sometime around the 1920s, but a couple of decades later, bodega culture absolutely exploded.</span></p>
<p><strong>Anibal:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I would say that the time period where the bodega really skyrocketed to prominence was from the ’40s to the ’70s. We saw a tenfold increase in the number of Puerto Ricans in New York City. So what was originally a community of around 60,000 in 1940 grew to over 600,000 by 1980.</span></p>
<p><strong>Dylan:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Anibal says there were a few reasons for this. This is right around World War II. Air travel is getting popular. There was another reason, though, something called Operation Bootstrap. Operation Bootstrap has its own complicated, controversial history, but essentially, it was a government program between Puerto Rico and the U.S., which was meant to turn Puerto Rico from an essentially agrarian society into an industrialized one. It completely reshaped the island, and eventually, there were not enough industrial jobs to go around, and so the Puerto Rican government created an office specifically designed to push Puerto Rican immigration to New York City.</span></p>
<p><strong>Anibal: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">So you have this huge post-World War II migration, and you have new Puerto Rican communities. They want the food from their homelands, and the bodega was that center focal point, much the same way that we rely on it now, the Puerto Rican communities, I would say, relied on it more so, and it served a greater social function than it does now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some people would get their mail delivered to the bodegas, especially if they were just renting a single room in an apartment or something like that. Many people did not have telephones, and the only place where you could make phone calls was to pay the bodeguero to use their phone. Also, it was where you would exchange gossip. That’s how you would stay up to date on local happenings in the neighborhood. Someone died. An apartment’s empty. Someone’s looking for work. It was also an engine of the informal economy, like a job bulletin board in its own way as well.</span></p>
<p><strong>Dylan: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the corner stores that are the ancestors of these very first bodegas, they are everywhere. It can be hard to say a specific number, but the estimates are somewhere between 7,000 and 14,000 delis and bodegas across the city.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But back to the chopped cheese. The sandwich certainly came out of corner store culture, but in the past decade or so, it has spread well beyond the bodega. People with pretty real cred are putting their own spin on it. People like Kwame Onwuachi, who was raised in the Bronx, has since opened a fine dining restaurant called Tatiana. It’s in Lincoln Center, and of course, on the menu is a chopped cheese made with aged ribeye and truffles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then there are the guys behind </span><a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/ghetto-gastro-cookbook-black-power-kitchen"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ghetto Gastro</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is a Bronx-based culinary collective. They have a recipe for something called a chopped “stease,” which is a vegan version of the sandwich.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember Jeremy, who tried his first chopped cheese in his mom’s bodega when he was a teenager? These days, he runs a food truck and two counter restaurants dedicated to the sandwich. They are called Bodega Truck and Bodega City.</span></p>
<p><strong>Jeremy: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s just my favorite thing to eat. Yes, you can get it anywhere in New York City, any bodega. You can go to any corner store to get a chopped cheese, but I would always remix it. I would add bacon and eggs. I would always do something different with the chopped cheese. It’s like, let me just make my own.</span></p>
<p><strong>Dylan: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeremy’s storefront is sort of an homage to the classic bodega. There’s a stuffed bodega cat sitting on the counter. Jeremy says that that’s the manager. And he’s got the place stocked with all of the nostalgic candies that you get in corner stores. Things like Fun Dip, the little gummy hamburgers—ah, they’re so good—or the bubble gum shaped like Band-Aids that comes in the metal container. You know what I’m talking about, these are classic, these are classic things.</span></p>
<p><strong>Jeremy:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This is the New York that I grew up in, the colorful bodegas with the lights and the candies and just a version of New York that’s slowly getting modernized and gentrified. It happens. Things change. You can’t expect some things to stay the same forever, so it is what it is.</span></p>
<p><strong>Dylan: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">So Jeremy took his experience growing up in a bodega and turned it into a new iteration, and a new iteration of the chopped cheese. As for Anibal’s family, they sold their bodega when Anibal was about 10 years old.</span></p>
<p><strong>Anibal:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I pass by it like every single day, and I always like, I point out to everybody like, we used to own that. It was 712 9th Avenue, was the address.</span></p>
<p><strong>Dylan:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Ironically, that nostalgia does not mean you will find him in line for the famous bodega sandwich.</span></p>
<p><strong>Anibal: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am not a chopped cheese guy.</span></p>
<p><strong>Dylan: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Listen, to each their own. I guess I’m an egg and cheese guy when it really comes down to it. Anyway, Anibal says the chopped cheese is one of these sandwiches that has entered that vaulted zone. It is now firmly considered what he calls a folk sandwich.</span></p>
<p><strong>Anibal:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Every folk sandwich has its origin story, right? The Philly cheesesteak, or the Italian beef, how a lot of societies developed the bow and arrow. Like, I’m sure that there was some bodeguero in Washington Heights who was like, “I’ve been making that for 10 years”, like, “What are you talking about?” So the chopped cheese definitely—if it didn’t happen in East Harlem, it would have happened somewhere.</span></p>
<p><strong>Dylan:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Somewhere in New York City. If you want to try a chopped cheese for yourself, you can, of course, head to Hajji’s Deli on 110th Street, 1st Avenue in Manhattan. They say they invented it, so you can go to the original source. Or you can hit up Jeremy at Bodega City, he has locations in Brooklyn and in the Bronx. Or you can literally just walk into any bodega on any block in New York City and say, “Give me a chopped cheese,” and it will be so good.</span></p>

Nectar Soda

<p><img alt="An Aglamesis nectar soda." data-width="4344" data-height="4043" width="300" height="200" src="https://img.atlasobscura.com/gLqA8RaTQNIL0MupnRjPCWB4QRxXZdJs1eCFvMqaXY8/rs:fill:300:200:1/g:ce/q:81/sm:1/scp:1/ar:1/aHR0cHM6Ly9hdGxh/cy1kZXYuczMuYW1h/em9uYXdzLmNvbS91/cGxvYWRzL3RoaW5n/X2ltYWdlcy80YTQw/MzA1NC04MjBhLTQw/MmEtYmU5My1iYWZi/YWU5ZGViNDc5Y2Rk/YjY1YjA4NGY1MmFm/YzRfQWdsYW1lc2lz/IG5lY3RhciBzb2Rh/IG9uIHRhYmxlIDIu/anBn.jpg" /></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Cincinnati is best known for breweries, another effervescent beverage has a long history in the Queen City: the nectar soda.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Home to the oldest pharmacy college in the U.S. west of the Alleghenies, the</span><a href="https://lloydlibrary.org/research/archives/eclectic-medicine/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Eclectic Medical Institute</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (1845-1952), and</span><a href="https://lloydlibrary.org/about/a-brief-history-of-the-lloyd-library-and-museum/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Lloyd Brothers Pharmacists</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Cincinnati was long on the forefront of the pharmaceutical industry. The city had a number of apothecaries with soda fountains, as well as confectioners serving countless carbonated concoctions—some claiming to cure a variety of ailments, and others simply providing customers with something sweet and refreshing to drink.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enter the nectar soda. The flavor is a combination of vanilla and bitter almond, and the drink is pastel pink in color—a nod to the hue of almond flowers, according to </span><a href="https://dannwoellertthefoodetymologist.wordpress.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dann Woellert</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a Cincinnati food historian, etymologist, and the author of </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cincinnati-Candy-History-American-Palate/dp/1467137952"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cincinnati Candy: A Sweet History</span></em></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Nicknamed the “</span><a href="https://www.proquest.com/hnpcincinnatienquirershell/historical-newspapers/august-2-1942-page-55-108/docview/1882746511/sem-2?accountid=39387"><span style="font-weight: 400;">drink of the gods</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” the bitter almond flavor of nectar soda balances out what would otherwise be overly sweet vanilla, creating an addictive taste that grows on you with each sip. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nectar sodas have been served in Cincinnati since at least the late 1870s, though, like many iconic foods and beverages, its precise origins are murky. The only other U.S. city to embrace nectar sodas was New Orleans, but unlike Cincinnati, the tradition fizzled out in the Big Easy in the mid-20th century. Plus, Woellert says that the Queen City popularized them first. “They were served in Cincinnati nearly a decade before New Orleans,” he says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the Cincinnati nectar soda has multiple origin stories, each crediting a different pharmacist or confectioner, Woellert has concluded that </span><a href="https://www.proquest.com/hnpcincinnatienquirershell/historical-newspapers/april-13-1947-page-98-151/docview/1882885311/sem-2?accountid=39387"><span style="font-weight: 400;">John Mullane</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> created the flavor after traveling to Quebec City to learn the art of confectionery from a prominent Canadian candymaker. He began serving nectar sodas in his confectionery shop in downtown Cincinnati in the late 1870s.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, why did the nectar soda end up in Cincinnati and New Orleans, of all places? Wollert suspects that the bitter almond and vanilla flavor was used by the French Acadians who settled in both Quebec City and New Orleans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though nectar sodas aren’t as common as they were in the early 20th century, when they could be found at countless confectioneries and pharmacy soda fountains across Cincinnati, they’re still served at establishments throughout the city and the surrounding area. Nectar sodas have been on the menu at ice cream and chocolate shop </span><a href="https://www.aglamesis.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aglamesis Brothers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> since it opened in Cincinnati in 1908, if not shortly thereafter. That’s according to company president and CEO Randy Young, who is also a third-generation family member. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s unclear when nectar sodas were added to the </span><a href="https://digital.cincinnatilibrary.org/digital/collection/p16998coll32/id/2220/rec/19"><span style="font-weight: 400;">menu</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at </span><a href="https://www.graeters.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Graeter’s</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a Cincinnati ice cream and chocolate shop that opened in 1870 and now has locations throughout the city and the Midwest, but Chip Graeter, chief of retail operations and a fourth-generation family member, says that they were especially popular throughout the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a </span><a href="https://www.proquest.com/hnpcincinnatienquirershell/historical-newspapers/january-28-1947-page-2-26/docview/1882876222/sem-2?accountid=39387"><span style="font-weight: 400;">January 28, 1947 article</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cincinnati Enquirer</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Tom Moore, the head of the soda department at Dow Drug Store—which operated 32 soda fountains throughout the metropolitan area at that time—said that “nectar is one of the most popular flavors in all of their stores, and has been for many years.” Five years prior, </span><a href="https://www.proquest.com/hnpcincinnatienquirershell/historical-newspapers/august-16-1942-page-63-99/docview/1882739776/sem-2?accountid=39387"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dow ran an ad</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the same newspaper which read: “Be glad you live in Cincinnati, the only place in the country where you can enjoy a Dow double-dip nectar soda.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Originally, nectar syrup was made by combining half-and-half or milk with water, bitter almond extract, vanilla extract and red food coloring. While Aglamesis eventually switched to a dairy-free shelf-stable syrup, Graeter's recipe has never changed—it still contains milk and needs to be refrigerated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both Aglamesis and Graeter’s make nectar soda by mixing nectar syrup with a dollop of whipped cream, adding a scoop or two of vanilla ice cream, then topping it off with some soda water and more whipped cream.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Young says that nectar sodas are most popular with older adults, they’re also a hit with members of younger generations who try them. “People who grew up with them still love them today,” Graeter says. “We still make them in all of our stores, but they're not nearly as popular today as they once were, simply because milkshakes and smoothies have taken over.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Young, there is a commercially available descendant of </span><a href="https://www.coca-cola.com/us/en/brands/barq-s"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the nectar soda</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “Commercial soda companies like Barqs and others came out with their version of cream soda—a bright pink soda—which got its flavoring from nectar soda,” he explains.</span></p>

Tiquira
Wed, 03 Apr 2024 19:17:00 -0400
https://www.atlasobscura.com/foods/tiquira
https://www.atlasobscura.com/foods/tiquira
<p><img alt="" data-width="5456" data-height="3632" width="300" height="200" src="https://img.atlasobscura.com/AVz4e7Gut8Wj5dEAKjG4GdVeQ-Naog6rw3iXhMFXb0k/rs:fill:300:200:1/g:ce/q:81/sm:1/scp:1/ar:1/aHR0cHM6Ly9hdGxh/cy1kZXYuczMuYW1h/em9uYXdzLmNvbS91/cGxvYWRzL3RoaW5n/X2ltYWdlcy9mMjk5/MWM1Mi05NDFkLTRk/ODYtYjMxZC0xZTU1/OTI0ZjI2M2Q3MDUx/Mzk4NTM2MTc1YzZh/ZDhfRFNDMDk5MTUu/SlBH.jpg" /></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indigenous Brazilians have fermented alcoholic beverages from the cassava root for thousands of years. These beer-like beverages go by names like </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">cauim</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">caxiri</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">tarubá</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Fermentation is an important step in cassava processing—the raw root has chemicals that can turn into cyanide in the human body. Native peoples found that a bit of human saliva and some naturally occurring yeast could eliminate these toxins and improve the nutritious value of the tuber. When the technology of distillation arrived to the Munim River region (now in Maranhão), locals who already drank lightly alcoholic cassava beverages began to distill them. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiquira</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was born. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The name <em>tiquira</em> is likely derived from the Tupi word </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">tykyre </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">meaning "to drip." But it is a curiosity that the spirit has flourished in only one Brazilian state, Maranhão. Margot Stinglwagner, founder of </span><a href="https://www.guaajatiquira.com/en/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guaaja Tiquira</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the first modern brand to produce the spirit starting in 2016, says “It’s a spirit that is also unknown in Brazil. A few people have heard about tiquira—but usually only people who have gone to Maranhão once.” Accordingly, the state moved to declare the spirit as a piece of Cultural and Intangible Heritage </span><a href="https://www.al.ma.leg.br/noticias/48515"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in September 2023</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of the reason that tiquira has remained so isolated is that cachaça, Brazil’s rum, is far easier to produce. Because the rum comes from sugarcane, the sugar for fermentation is already there. “With cassava, you don’t have sugar,” Stinglwagner explains. “You must first transform the carbohydrates into sugar and then you can ferment and distill it.” To achieve this end, Guaaja Tiquira uses food enzymes instead of the traditional human saliva. Guaaja also differs from other distillers because they use full cassava roots where most tiquira moonshiners rely on processed </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">farinha de mandioca</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or cassava flour. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The majority of people produce it illegally,” laughs Stinglwagner. “The state does nothing about it.” Outside of the urban center, tiquira is invariably a homemade product. Generally, tiquira makers don’t separate the "heads" (the first drops of liquor from a distillation, which contain harsher alcohols including toxic methanol and other pungent and volatile flavor compounds) from the "tails" (the final liquid produced from distillation, which has a low alcohol content and can have unwelcome bitter flavors), meaning the spirit is stronger and may contain more toxins and impurities. Some even macerate marijuana into the combined spirit to produce the doubly-illicit <em>tiquiconha</em>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maranhenses believe that you cannot get wet or bathe after drinking tiquira, lest you become faint or dizzy. Zelinda Machado de Castro e Lima, one of the great chroniclers of folk culture in Maranhão, has recorded other traditions surrounding the drink. Firstly, it is typical to pierce a cashew with a toothpick and soak it in a glass of tiquira for several hours. It is then sucked as a sort of boozy lollipop. She also writes about the belief that those drinking coffee should avoid tiquira, while locals say that fishermen on the coast used the liquor to sanitize wounds incurred on the job. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, there is the curious question of the color of tiquira. In the tourist markets of São Luís, the spirit is always blushing a translucent violet. “They say that the color of tiquira is from tangerine leaves, but we tried to do it and the color from the leaves is not stable,” says Stinglwagner. “It is also not a strong color. The norms and laws for tiquira prohibit the addition of the leaves.” The violet color may be artificial (perhaps from food dyes), but some tiquiras do have a citrusy flavor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiquira today is still largely relegated to the world of moonshining, but with the government’s recognition of the spirit and new legitimate ventures like that of Guaaja Tiquira, Brazil could be seeing more of the cassava liquor outside of its home in Maranhão. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All the people say to me, ‘What is this new spirit?,’” says Stinglwagner. “I say, ‘It’s not a new spirit, it’s the oldest spirit from Brazil.’”</span></p>
<p><strong>Know Before You Go</strong></p>
<p>Tiquira is widely available in the downtown markets of São Luís, Maranhão. Both the local Mercado Central and touristic Mercado das Tulhas have many vendors selling tiquira. The commercial brand, Guaaja Tiquira, is also available in São Luís at Empório Fribal, in addition to Copacabana Palace and Fairmont Hotel in Rio de Janeiro, and Mocotó Bar e Restaurante in São Paulo. </p>

Maultaschen

<p><img alt="Maultaschen can contain a number of different fillings. " data-width="2500" data-height="1875" width="300" height="200" src="https://img.atlasobscura.com/ra2_Vn6gdr9tweWqKKQljzyxXDXHA_0H-9IkiLmOorM/rs:fill:300:200:1/g:ce/q:81/sm:1/scp:1/ar:1/aHR0cHM6Ly9hdGxh/cy1kZXYuczMuYW1h/em9uYXdzLmNvbS91/cGxvYWRzL3RoaW5n/X2ltYWdlcy8zYzNl/ZTFjZi0wMDRmLTQ3/NGUtYTVmMS0yY2My/ZjQxZDFhOWVmZjJh/YTFkNTcxYzIwNmJl/MjdfTWF1bHRhc2No/ZW5fMi5qcGc.jpg" /></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The origins of Germany’s </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maultaschen</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are deliciously devious. Legend has it that, in the late Middle Ages, a lay brother named Jakob invented the stuffed pasta dumplings at the Maulbronn Monastery, a UNESCO World Heritage site founded in 1147 by Cistercian monks in southwest Germany.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One direct translation of Maultaschen is “mouth pockets,” though “Maul” could just as easily refer to Maulbronn. Maultaschen are usually square dumplings (though sometimes they're rolled) and can be fried in a pan or served in broth. Commonly described as Germany’s version of Italian ravioli, they allegedly emerged as a way to use up an unexpected bounty of meat that Brother Jakob stumbled upon in the forest outside the monastery walls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The twist? Although they abhorred waste, these monks weren’t allowed to eat the meat of four-legged animals, especially during the Catholic fasting period of Lent in the spring. So Brother Jakob minced the meat with herbs and onions and wrapped everything inside pasta dough, hiding the forbidden flesh from the eyes of his fellow monks—and even from the eyes of God.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Swabia, the region encompassing much of Baden-Württemberg and part of Bavaria where Maultaschen originated, one of the colloquial names for the food references this deception directly: </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Herrgottsbescheißerle</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> means “little God-cheaters.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone in Swabia has their version of the legend with more or less embellishment. Ludwig Nestler holds a master’s degree in heritage conservation and works for the State Palaces and Gardens of Baden-Württemberg, a government organization that oversees monuments like Maulbronn Monastery. His version of the tale includes a sack of stolen meat dropped in the woods by a fleeing thief, which inspires Brother Jakob’s trickery in the kitchen. But he acknowledges that there’s no undisputed “historically correct version” of how Maultaschen came to be. Similarly, everyone in Swabia has their own Maultaschen recipe, with unique ingredients for the minced filling, called </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brät</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Traditionally the Brät is made from pork mixed with herbs, onions, and occasionally bread crumbs for texture and stability,” says Nestler. Swabia, however, “was a rather poor region with limited amounts of meat due to rather unfertile land, so being adaptive and innovative has always been a part of the people’s nature.” As Maultaschen became popular, fish and seasonal vegetables like spinach, carrots, beets, and mushrooms became common inclusions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the European Union ties Maultaschen to Swabia with a </span><a href="https://www.tmdn.org/giview/gi/EUGI00000013631"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Protected Geographical Indication</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which lists required ingredients the authentic product should feature, but even the necessary inclusions are pretty loose, such as “pork and/or beef and/or veal” for meat Brät and “typical regional vegetables” for meat-free Brät. It speaks to the way the dumplings developed as subsistence food, used to stretch leftovers and reduce food waste.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Germans throughout the country enjoy Maultaschen in dozens of flavors in all seasons thanks to grocery stores that stock packaged varieties made by companies like Ditzingen-based Bürger, whose mascot, </span><a href="https://www.buerger.de/buerger-welt/erwin/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Erwin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maultasche</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (the singular form of the plural Maultaschen).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the dumplings remain most popular in southern Germany. Maulbronn Monastery offers a special tour that pairs Maultaschen with wine from the monastery’s vineyards. And many locals, including Nestler’s family, still make them from scratch on special occasions—even during Lent, when meat might otherwise be off the menu. There’s no telling if it’s a fraud good enough to fool God, but it’s worth a shot.</span></p>
