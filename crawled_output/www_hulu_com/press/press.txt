HULU’S CRITICALLY ACCLAIMED COMEDY SERIES ‘DELI BOYS’ RENEWED FOR A SECOND SEASON
Onyx Collective and 20th Television announced today that the critically acclaimed Hulu Original comedy series “Deli Boys” has been renewed for a second season. Fred Armisen (“Saturday Night Live,” “Wednesday”) will join the sophomore season as a series regular, alongside Asif Ali, Saagar Shaikh and Poorna Jagannathan. “Deli Boys” follows a pair of pampered Pakistani American brothers who lose everything and are forced to reckon with their Baba’s secret life of crime as they attempt to take up his mantle in the underworld.
