JJanaFromSpainEverything was clean, and all the staff was so nice.
Tasty huge breakfast on the covered patio at the back of the property with views of a bird feeder. We saw even the toucans! The owner has a telescope to let the guests view the birds.
It felt special to have Leo lead the night tour of their garden to look for frogs, for every guestroom separately (we stayed 3 nights).
The beds are huge and comfortable. There are 3 AC units in the huge main room which has 2 sections for 2 of the king beds, and the cold air overflows into the 3rd bedroom too.
Beautiful heated pool with sunbeds.
It is only a couple of minutes to drive/taxi into La Fortuna town for many restaurants and services, and some of the attractions of the area are closeby (La Fortuna waterfall, El Salto, some of the tours / farms - we visited Finca Educativa Don Juan behind the property and liked it a lot).
We could have had laundry done too.
Communication excellent. We wish them all the best!Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.59.5Exceptional - What previous guests thought, 1,171 reviewsExceptional 1,171 reviewsPrice from£119.011 night, 2 adultsCheck availabilityHotel Secreto La FortunaHotel in FortunaDiscover the charm of Hotel Secreto La Fortuna, a quiet retreat in the heart of Fortuna, Costa Rica.

CCraigFromUnited KingdomThis Place is absolutely oustanding in every aspect, first of all we checked in to a very friendly welcome and also to find out room had been upgraded and it did not dissapoint, the Casita Deluxe rooms are spacious, clean and very well decorated not to mention looking out to the forest from the balcony/patio area, where you can relax in your hammock and listen to the wildlife around.
Staff are extremely pleasant and attentive and always went out of there way to help you, even pointing out some wildlife in the trees above, ( literally a sloth living in the trees above the restuarant every where around you you see something interesting!)
The grounds around the Finca are also astonishing you have a few walks you can do around the grounds and you are guaranteed to see all sorts of wildlife, they also do some tours onsite as they have a massive reserve of land, we did the night tour and it did not dissapoint, we saw a multitude of wildlife as the forrest literally comes alive at night, from the most colourful of tree frogs to giant fruit bats there was always something to spot, our guide was also extremely informative and had eyes like a hawk for finding things.
The restaurant and bar are situated right next to the pool is well furnished and relaxing place to chill for a very good cocktail or a Craft beer that is made by a local small brewery.
The food here is exceptional with the menu changing daily and provided locally from the farmlands of the finca itself, the breakfast was also fantastic, made to order eggs and fresh yoghurts, fruit etc.. even the honey is made onsite from the stingless bees.
We even had to leave very early before breakfast on our last day there and they kindly provided some fruits and juice for us to take.
The pool is large and well maitained and also the jacuzzi is located nearby, thre is also a spa area should you wish to have some treatments,
Overall a breathtaking place and you will not be dissapointed should you choose to stay.Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.29.2Superb - What previous guests thought, 495 reviewsSuperb 495 reviewsPrice from£129.591 night, 2 adultsCheck availabilitySee all 556 hotels in Arenal Volcano National ParkMost booked hotels in Arenal Volcano National Park in the past monthSee allHotel Los Lagos Spa & ResortHotel in FortunaPopular with guests booking hotels in Arenal Volcano National ParkScored out of 10, guest rating 9.19.1Superb - What previous guests thought, 4,321 reviews Superb · 4,321 reviewsSan Bosco InnHotel in FortunaPopular with guests booking hotels in Arenal Volcano National ParkScored out of 10, guest rating 9.09.0Superb - What previous guests thought, 2,129 reviews Superb · 2,129 reviewsArenal Roca Lodge & BungalowsHotel in FortunaPopular with guests booking hotels in Arenal Volcano National ParkScored out of 10, guest rating 8.28.2Very good - What previous guests thought, 1,381 reviews Very good · 1,381 reviewsArenal Manoa Resort & Hot SpringsHotel in FortunaPopular with guests booking hotels in Arenal Volcano National ParkScored out of 10, guest rating 9.39.3Superb - What previous guests thought, 1,545 reviews Superb · 1,545 reviewsArenal XilopaloHotel in FortunaPopular with guests booking hotels in Arenal Volcano National ParkScored out of 10, guest rating 8.98.9Fabulous - What previous guests thought, 2,824 reviews Fabulous · 2,824 reviewsHotel Secreto La FortunaHotel in FortunaPopular with guests booking hotels in Arenal Volcano National ParkScored out of 10, guest rating 9.09.0Superb - What previous guests thought, 1,458 reviews Superb · 1,458 reviewsOrquideas Boutique HotelHotel in FortunaPopular with guests booking hotels in Arenal Volcano National ParkScored out of 10, guest rating 8.78.7Fabulous - What previous guests thought, 1,702 reviews Fabulous · 1,702 reviewsCasa Luna Hotel & SpaHotel in FortunaPopular with guests booking hotels in Arenal Volcano National ParkScored out of 10, guest rating 8.88.8Fabulous - What previous guests thought, 1,325 reviews Fabulous · 1,325 reviewsMiradas Arenal Hotel & HotspringsHotel in FortunaPopular with guests booking hotels in Arenal Volcano National ParkScored out of 10, guest rating 8.88.8Fabulous - What previous guests thought, 1,169 reviews Fabulous · 1,169 reviewsLoma Real Hot Springs Bed & BreakfastHotel in FortunaPopular with guests booking hotels in Arenal Volcano National ParkScored out of 10, guest rating 8.68.6Fabulous - What previous guests thought, 742 reviews Fabulous · 742 reviewsArenal Volcano National Park's best hotels with breakfastSee allHotel El Silencio del CampoHotel in FortunaBreakfast optionsScored out of 10, guest rating 9.39.3Superb - What previous guests thought, 795 reviews Superb · 795 reviewsOffering an outdoor pool, relaxing volcanic hot springs and a restaurant, Hotel El Silencio del Campo is located 6 minutes’ drive from Fortuna.

Nothing is better after a day's hiking, than returning to the hotel in the afternoon and soaking in one or more of the heated jacuzzis or having a drink at the heated main pool bar. The temperature of the pools ranged between 38° to 40° celsius and the water was refilled constantly with fresh water from the thermal springs.
The staff were all so friendly and went out of their way to make us feel welcome and cater to our needs. Everyone from housekeeping (bed decorations with rose petals and a towel shaped like an elephant), to pool bar staff (top notch margaritas), front of desk staff (friendly check-in with many personal touches), restaurant staff (coffee replenished efficiently during rush hour) and front gate security entrance guard (jokes and banter as we were welcomed back like old friends after each days outing). These little touches across the board point to excellent management from the top.
We had a beautifully decorated room, incredible bathroom with state-of-the-art shower and luxurious natural spa bath products.
We booked a couples massage at the Loto spa and both the facilities and masseuses were great! We thoroughly recommend this for a great start to the vacation.
The location of the hotel is on the main road so you do get some traffic noise but the convenience of being able to easily drive into La Fortuna and the warmth and efficiency of the staff more than made up for this. Plus our room had amazing views of the volcano and it was quite something to wake up and watch the sunrise from our balcony with the volcano in front of us.Show moreAGuest review byAthensKiwiGreeceArenal Paraiso Resort Spa & Thermo Mineral Hot SpringsFortunaFrom £140.13 per nightScored out of 10, guest rating 8.28.2Very good - What previous guests thought, 1,623 reviews Very good · 1,623 reviewsThe rooms are beautiful, clean and comfortable, and the 11 thermal pools are warm and wonderful! The flora and fauna around and in the hotel's grounds are spectacular. We told our friends, who were with us here for the first time, to look for the birds and animals we had seen on previous visits, and we were not disappointed! We saw so many different things just walking the grounds and sitting on our front and back patios. We left with an entire album full of photos of the many different birds, monkeys, squirrels, coatis and more. The full buffet breakfast was an enjoyable treat, as it changed daily and surprised us with all the offerings, including all you can eat and cooked-to-order food! The gift shop was also quite a nice surprise as it included many things found in local souvenir shops, and some things not found other places, at better prices!
Every room in this hotel has a full view of the volcano which happily popped its head out thru the clouds during our rainy stay! This is a full service hotel that pays attention to detail as, when informed of our friends first stay here, they were treated to towel sculptures left on their beds! We will return soon for our fifth stay at this great hotel.Show moreCGuest review byCamilleCosta RicaHotel El Silencio del CampoFortunaFrom £203.22 per nightScored out of 10, guest rating 9.39.3Superb - What previous guests thought, 795 reviews Superb · 795 reviewsThis is an amazing place!

Get inspired by reviews of cities in Arenal Volcano National Park10.0We enjoyed the area and while we did a lot including driving...We enjoyed the area and while we did a lot including driving to Monteverde for zipline tour, we chose one day of pampering rather than adventure so did not hike around Arenal or paddle board on Arenal. We did white water rafting between Puerto Viejo and Fortuna. We did waterfall repelling near Fortuna (amazing). The people are friendly and the area is lovely. We enjoyed a night time nature tour with our hotel (Noah's Landing) and Nayara Gardens was amazing. We saw plenty of sloths but so much more! We went to the Mistico hanging bridges on a rainy day which worked well-it did not matter. We also visited the Fortuna Waterfall (500 steps down-then 500 steps up but worth it!) If you like adventure- there is plenty. If you want to relax-it is a beautiful place to do so.Show moreTGuest review byTamiUnited States10.0Our trip was mostly rejuvenation, health and to access the...Our trip was mostly rejuvenation, health and to access the volcano and hot springs. We went to Arenal park and hiked the trail to the Volcano.
We saw a Capibara but most other wildlife is best viewed in the early morning. There were a lot of orchids in bloom along the trails.
Going to EcoTermales Hotspring was the highlight. It's a gorgeous naturally constructed spa with layered pools, waterfalls all built with stacked granite rockery, bridges and pathways connect the pools, and there's plenty of seating, an open bar that serves the best mixed drinks.
The restaurant served fresh healthy assortment of seafood and meats with veggie dishes with dessert at Lunch.
The water was fed from the natural hotspring, which was circulated , refreshed constantly with fresh volcanic water. Attention to the holistic elements of nature were throughout. Staff and Service were top notch.Show moreSGuest review bySuZImageZCanada10.0This is a great area to experience Costa Rica and the...This is a great area to experience Costa Rica and the wildlife. We visited Mistico hanging bridges (great with a guide as located creatures we would not have); La Fortuna waterfall (no guide needed); Sky adventures (aerial tram, zip lines & trails); sloth guided tour; Arenal Observatory Lodge & Trails (day pass with lunch) - all of which we would recommend!Show moreAGuest review byAmandaUnited Kingdom8.0It is difficult to get around in Costa Rica.It is difficult to get around in Costa Rica.
They have on main major highway and you must get off that highway to get to Jaco and Fortuna.
The roads are windy and it takes forever to get somewhere.
It took us 3.5 hours to get from Fortuna to San Jose and it is less than 100 miles.
This is due to the windy roads which are typically one lane in each direction.
However, it is a beautiful drive.
Just be prepared!
If you are in the Jaco area, do not miss Villa Caletas.
Has an amazing view.
We stayed at the Marriott Vacation Club at Los Suenos in Garabito.
It is a beautiful property.Show moreDGuest review byDenaUnited StatesResearch, refine and make plans for your whole tripHotels in San JoséHit the road and make the most of your trip by discovering another popular destination within Costa Rica.Hotels in Corcovado National ParkDiscover another popular destination within Costa Rica.Hotels in FortunaA popular choice with guests visiting Arenal Volcano National Park.Hotels in El Castillo de La FortunaA popular choice with guests visiting Arenal Volcano National Park.Cheap holidays in FortunaBook the best flights, stays and more – all in one placeHotels near La Fortuna WaterfallPlaces to stay with a popular tourist attraction nearby.Hotels near Venado CavesFind hotels close to Venado Caves, a popular tourist attraction for visitors heading to the same area of Costa Rica.Flights to Arenal Volcano National ParkReaching Arenal Volcano National Park just got easier!Hostels in Arenal Volcano National ParkExplore more great accommodation options for your trip.Show moreCountriesRegionsCitiesDistrictsAirportsHotelsPlaces of interestHoliday HomesApartmentsResortsVillasHostelsB&BsGuest HousesUnique places to stayAll destinationsAll flight destinationsAll car hire locationsAll holiday destinationsGuidesDiscoverReviewsDiscover monthly staysSupportCoronavirus (COVID-19) FAQsManage your tripsContact Customer ServiceSafety resource centreDiscoverGenius loyalty programmeSeasonal and holiday dealsTravel articlesBooking.com for BusinessTraveller Review AwardsCar hireFlight finderRestaurant reservationsBooking.com for Travel AgentsTerms and settingsManage cookie settingsPrivacy & cookiesTerms of ServiceAccessibility StatementDispute resolutionModern Slavery StatementHuman Rights StatementPartnersExtranet loginPartner helpList your propertyBecome an affiliateAboutAbout Booking.comHow we workSustainabilityPress centreCareersInvestor relationsCorporate contactGBPBooking.com is part of Booking Holdings Inc., the world leader in online travel and related services.
