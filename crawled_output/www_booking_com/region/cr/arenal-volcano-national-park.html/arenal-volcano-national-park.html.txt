Get inspired by reviews of cities in Arenal Volcano National Park10.0We enjoyed the area and while we did a lot including driving...We enjoyed the area and while we did a lot including driving to Monteverde for zipline tour, we chose one day of pampering rather than adventure so did not hike around Arenal or paddle board on Arenal. We did white water rafting between Puerto Viejo and Fortuna. We did waterfall repelling near Fortuna (amazing). The people are friendly and the area is lovely. We enjoyed a night time nature tour with our hotel (Noah's Landing) and Nayara Gardens was amazing. We saw plenty of sloths but so much more! We went to the Mistico hanging bridges on a rainy day which worked well-it did not matter. We also visited the Fortuna Waterfall (500 steps down-then 500 steps up but worth it!) If you like adventure- there is plenty. If you want to relax-it is a beautiful place to do so.Show moreTGuest review byTamiUnited States10.0Our trip was mostly rejuvenation, health and to access the...Our trip was mostly rejuvenation, health and to access the volcano and hot springs. We went to Arenal park and hiked the trail to the Volcano.
We saw a Capibara but most other wildlife is best viewed in the early morning. There were a lot of orchids in bloom along the trails.
Going to EcoTermales Hotspring was the highlight. It's a gorgeous naturally constructed spa with layered pools, waterfalls all built with stacked granite rockery, bridges and pathways connect the pools, and there's plenty of seating, an open bar that serves the best mixed drinks.
The restaurant served fresh healthy assortment of seafood and meats with veggie dishes with dessert at Lunch.
The water was fed from the natural hotspring, which was circulated , refreshed constantly with fresh volcanic water. Attention to the holistic elements of nature were throughout. Staff and Service were top notch.Show moreSGuest review bySuZImageZCanada10.0This is a great area to experience Costa Rica and the...This is a great area to experience Costa Rica and the wildlife. We visited Mistico hanging bridges (great with a guide as located creatures we would not have); La Fortuna waterfall (no guide needed); Sky adventures (aerial tram, zip lines & trails); sloth guided tour; Arenal Observatory Lodge & Trails (day pass with lunch) - all of which we would recommend!Show moreAGuest review byAmandaUnited Kingdom8.0It is difficult to get around in Costa Rica.It is difficult to get around in Costa Rica.
They have on main major highway and you must get off that highway to get to Jaco and Fortuna.
The roads are windy and it takes forever to get somewhere.
It took us 3.5 hours to get from Fortuna to San Jose and it is less than 100 miles.
This is due to the windy roads which are typically one lane in each direction.
However, it is a beautiful drive.
Just be prepared!
If you are in the Jaco area, do not miss Villa Caletas.
Has an amazing view.
We stayed at the Marriott Vacation Club at Los Suenos in Garabito.
It is a beautiful property.Show moreDGuest review byDenaUnited StatesResearch, refine, and make plans for your whole tripCheap vacations in FortunaPlan everything you need for your vacation in one place – from flights and stays to tours and activitiesHotels in Costa RicaSet off to explore the whole country.Hostels in Arenal Volcano National ParkExplore more great accommodation options for your trip.Bungalows in Arenal Volcano National ParkExplore more great accommodation options for your trip.Hotels near La Fortuna WaterfallPlaces to stay with a popular tourist attraction nearby.Hotels near Cavernas de VenadoPlaces to stay with a popular tourist attraction nearby.Flights to Arenal Volcano National ParkGet your flight tickets to Arenal Volcano National Park right here on Booking.com.Hotels in San JoséDiscover another popular destination in Costa Rica.Hotels in Corcovado National ParkDiscover another popular destination in Costa Rica.Show moreCountriesRegionsCitiesDistrictsAirportsHotelsPlaces of interestVacation HomesApartmentsResortsVillasHostelsB&BsGuest HousesUnique places to stayAll destinationsAll flight destinationsAll car rental locationsAll vacation destinationsGuidesDiscoverReviewsDiscover monthly staysSupportCoronavirus (COVID-19) FAQsManage your tripsContact Customer ServiceSafety Resource CenterDiscoverGenius loyalty programSeasonal and holiday dealsTravel articlesBooking.com for BusinessTraveller Review AwardsCar rentalFlight finderRestaurant reservationsBooking.com for Travel AgentsTerms and settingsPrivacy & cookiesTerms of ServiceAccessibility StatementDispute resolutionModern Slavery StatementHuman Rights StatementPartnersExtranet loginPartner helpList your propertyBecome an affiliateAboutAbout Booking.comHow We WorkSustainabilityPress centerCareersInvestor relationsCorporate contactContent guidelines and reportingUSDBooking.com is part of Booking Holdings Inc., the world leader in online travel and related services.
