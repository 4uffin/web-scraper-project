We can recommend Oscar's and Spotted Dog restaurants for any meal and Porters for breakfast.

Loved the Toadstool Hoodoos which is located at the Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument just before getting into Kanab and it is only a 1.7 mi RT hike.
Loved Wild Thyme restaurant.
Had their salmon dish and we shared a delish dessert.
Went to Moqui Cave. Very interesting story of the lineage of the Hopi Cave told by the employees.
It is very touristy but very cool to check out and if you are into rocks, gems, Native American jewelry, it is a must stop.
They have wind caves there but didn’t have time for that.
A beautiful area.
Reminds me of a mini-Sedona.

So if you are planning to do one, book early. There was only 1 restaurant that open while we were there. We love the Petrified Forest, Escalante River hike, Lower Calf Falls, as well as the Long Slot Canyon. Some of the attractions need a 4x4. Wish we knew ahead of time. Overall, very enjoyable! Cute little town with lots to do.Show moreDGuest review byDianaUnited States10.0Cannonville is in the Grand Staircase/Escalante National...Cannonville is in the Grand Staircase/Escalante National Monument, so there is beautiful scenery surrounding it and the nearby towns, including Bryce Canyon National Park, Kodachrome Basin State Park, and Grosvenor Arch. What's nice about Cannonville is that it's in a quiet little valley, so is less exposed to the coldest weather and the winds that buffet the higher, more exposed towns in the area. It's on Scenic Route 12, so any direction you travel has gorgeous scenery!
A day trip up to Capitol Reef is a little over two hours' drive away, and there are breath-taking landscapes and views all along the way. Loved it!Show morekGuest review bykarenUnited StatesResearch, refine, and make plans for your whole tripHotels in the United StatesIf you're planning a longer trip, look beyond Bryce Canyon National Park
