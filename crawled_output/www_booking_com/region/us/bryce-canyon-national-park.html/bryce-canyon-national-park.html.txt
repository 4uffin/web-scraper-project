Loved the Toadstool Hoodoos which is located at the Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument just before getting into Kanab and it is only a 1.7 mi RT hike.
Loved Wild Thyme restaurant.
Had their salmon dish and we shared a delish dessert.
Went to Moqui Cave. Very interesting story of the lineage of the Hopi Cave told by the employees.
It is very touristy but very cool to check out and if you are into rocks, gems, Native American jewelry, it is a must stop.
They have wind caves there but didn’t have time for that.
A beautiful area.
Reminds me of a mini-Sedona.

We were traveling through here when my husband was hospitalized for 5 days. Everyone, hospital staff, hotel owner, laundry mat, pharmacy, etc...were very helpful and kind. Cannot say enough good about it. My husband joked if he were younger, we would move there!Show moreMGuest review byMulkin10.0We have been visiting Cedar City for the past 8 years while...We have been visiting Cedar City for the past 8 years while our kids were attending Southern Utah University. We love the city and surrounding areas.
There is so much to do, but in a small town.
Views are beyond beautiful, and all the people are so kind.
We will continue to visit, and possibly retire there.Show moreWGuest review byWendyUnited States6.0There is not much in Hatch - we drove about 10-15 miles to...There is not much in Hatch - we drove about 10-15 miles to Panguitch to Joe's Market for groceries.
We did not have any meals in Hatch at whatever restaurants were there.
Panguitch had several restaurants where we ate and enjoyed.Show moreRGuest review byRebeccaUnited States8.0Quiet, friendly, family oriented town.Quiet, friendly, family oriented town. I felt safe walking around the entire town any time of day or night. Prices were a little steep in all the stores and eateries as you would expect from a town so close to tourist attractions.Show moreSGuest review bySaperstein10.0The Mountain lodge is high class and beautiful.The Mountain lodge is high class and beautiful.
I would stay there again.
I ordered the delicious Shrimp Tacos for my dinner and they came with homemade fries.
Very good!
Thank you Brian Head for having such a wonderful place and room to spend my one night on my travels.

So if you are planning to do one, book early. There was only 1 restaurant that open while we were there. We love the Petrified Forest, Escalante River hike, Lower Calf Falls, as well as the Long Slot Canyon. Some of the attractions need a 4x4. Wish we knew ahead of time. Overall, very enjoyable! Cute little town with lots to do.Show moreDGuest review byDianaUnited States10.0Cannonville is in the Grand Staircase/Escalante National...Cannonville is in the Grand Staircase/Escalante National Monument, so there is beautiful scenery surrounding it and the nearby towns, including Bryce Canyon National Park, Kodachrome Basin State Park, and Grosvenor Arch. What's nice about Cannonville is that it's in a quiet little valley, so is less exposed to the coldest weather and the winds that buffet the higher, more exposed towns in the area. It's on Scenic Route 12, so any direction you travel has gorgeous scenery!
A day trip up to Capitol Reef is a little over two hours' drive away, and there are breath-taking landscapes and views all along the way. Loved it!Show morekGuest review bykarenUnited StatesResearch, refine and make plans for your whole tripHotels in Yosemite National ParkHit the road and make the most of your trip by discovering another popular destination within the United States.Hotels in Disney World AreaDiscover another popular destination within the United States.Flights to Bryce Canyon National Park Reaching Bryce Canyon National Park
