KKrishnaFromSwitzerlandThe Hotel is located next to the Beach Park. It has been maintained well. The hotel has two outdoor pools along with hot tub. Sunrise viewing is a literally walk across the park. We had a ocean view room so could view the sunrise from the window. The hotel also has laundary facility, which was very effective. Also, there was enough parking including a overflow area. The check-in and check-out was seamless experience. It is highly recomended for families with kids. The unique thing is that Lydgate Beach Park is right next to the property, and you can spend quality time both during sunrise and sunset hours and throughout the day too.

The presence of sea turtles and seals are definitely a bonus. I'm verry happy that volunteers are protecting the animals on the beach against overenthusiastic tourists. The beach gets crowded during the day but there is enough space at the swimming pool or on the beach chairs (reserved for hotel guests only) in front of the beach.

The hotel is right at the beach and our 2nd floor apartment was the third away from the ocean but had a good sea view and one could hear the waves (as well as chicken, as Kauai is the Garden and Chicken Island of Hawaii - they are simply everywhere). The big pool area was very nice and well-maintained. The appartment was sufficiently equipped for preparing and eating food in the apartment. The airport is not far but beware of the rush hour on workdays - in the morning to Lihue and in the afternoon from Lihue. All attractions are easy to reach by car and/or a bit of hiking but depening on traffic, you better plan a day trip if you are going all north (Tunnels Beach, etc.) or south (especially Waimea Canyon).

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Kauai Lawai Beach Resort C103.
Our condo was on the ground floor with a lanai looking out to a garden area.
We loved seeing the island chickens and the nightly parakeets flocking to roost in the trees.
We were across the street from the beach which was convenient to watch the sunset every night.
We had a wonderful time in Kauai.
Po'ipu was a great location central to everything we wanted to see.Show moreAGuest review byAprilUnited States4.0Don't bother, so many more options available.Don't bother, so many more options available.
If you want to see some original cottages, just drive by.
Many locals stay there for parties with lots of people in one cottage - they receive nice discounts but do like to stay up late!
I would not go to Hawaii to swim in a pool but saw many people use theirs.
The beach was poor so no one was on it since you cannot swim.
They could have supplied bikes - that would have been a bonus. The distance to everything except Waimea Canyon is far but if you are planning on hiking the canyon daily it is your second best option (the first being cabins 1/2 way up the mountain).
You need a car since there is only one restaurant near by and the kitchen facilities are poor.
Hiking was great - would have been nice to stay where we could rent a paddle board or surfboards / boogie boards.
Def. take a helicopter ride and see the Napili Coast line from the water!Show morepGuest review bypaulUnited States10.0The Hanalei area is the opposite of a commercial resort...The Hanalei area is the opposite of a commercial resort style town. The businesses are small, mainly local. Tons of charm, beautiful beach. If you’re looking for nightlife, this might not be the right area for you. For local charm, it’s great.Show moreAGuest review byAnonymous10.0Super nice people, lots to see and do at any pace.Super nice people, lots to see and do at any pace.

I was unable to eat (except for coffee) or go swimming so did not do any of those things but there are beautiful beaches nearby.
There are so many things I could point out for travelers, but it would take pages!
For me, Lihue is a place to mostly do anything legal, doctors and shopping.Show moreBGuest review byBrownUnited States8.0Princeville is nice, however it is not the easiest place to...Princeville is nice, however it is not the easiest place to explore the island from.
if you want to relax, it would be a great destination, if you want to explore the island, i would suggest staying in Poipu BeachShow moreKGuest review byKarenUnited States8.0Lovely location with good restaurants and a relaxed vibe.Lovely location with good restaurants and a relaxed vibe. Very kid-friendly with keiki menus in all restaurants, and most will accommodate special request. Location is just really, really gorgeous. It is worth driving to Hanalei up north for a day since there is an amazing beach there.Show morePGuest review byPatriciaUnited StatesResearch, refine and make plans for your whole tripHotels in the United StatesIf you're planning a longer trip, look beyond Kauai and set off to explore the whole country!When to visit the United StatesEvents, prices, the weather and more.Car hire near Lihue AirportPick up your rental car as soon as you touch down.Hotels in Yosemite National ParkDiscover another popular destination within the United States.Hotels in Disney World AreaDiscover another popular destination within the United States.Hotels near Lihue AirportPerfect for a late arrival or early departure.Flights to KauaiGet your flight tickets to Kauai right here on Booking.com.Cheap hotels on KauaiExplore more great accommodation options for your trip.Apartments on KauaiExplore more great accommodation options for your trip.CountriesRegionsCitiesDistrictsAirportsHotelsPlaces of interestHoliday HomesApartmentsResortsVillasHostelsB&BsGuest HousesUnique places to stayAll destinationsAll flight destinationsAll car hire locationsAll holiday destinationsGuidesDiscoverReviewsDiscover monthly staysSupportCoronavirus (COVID-19) FAQsManage your tripsContact Customer ServiceSafety resource centreDiscoverGenius loyalty programmeSeasonal and holiday dealsTravel articlesBooking.com for BusinessTraveller Review AwardsCar hireFlight finderRestaurant reservationsBooking.com for Travel AgentsTerms and settingsManage cookie settingsPrivacy & cookiesTerms of ServiceAccessibility StatementDispute resolutionModern Slavery StatementHuman Rights StatementPartnersExtranet loginPartner helpList your propertyBecome an affiliateAboutAbout Booking.comHow we workSustainabilityPress centreCareersInvestor relationsCorporate contactGBPBooking.com is part of Booking Holdings Inc., the world leader in online travel and related services.
