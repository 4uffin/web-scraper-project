If you want to see some original cottages, just drive by.
Many locals stay there for parties with lots of people in one cottage - they receive nice discounts but do like to stay up late!
I would not go to Hawaii to swim in a pool but saw many people use theirs.
The beach was poor so no one was on it since you cannot swim.
They could have supplied bikes - that would have been a bonus. The distance to everything except Waimea Canyon is far but if you are planning on hiking the canyon daily it is your second best option (the first being cabins 1/2 way up the mountain).
You need a car since there is only one restaurant near by and the kitchen facilities are poor.
Hiking was great - would have been nice to stay where we could rent a paddle board or surfboards / boogie boards.

Very kid-friendly with keiki menus in all restaurants, and most will accommodate special request. Location is just really, really gorgeous.
