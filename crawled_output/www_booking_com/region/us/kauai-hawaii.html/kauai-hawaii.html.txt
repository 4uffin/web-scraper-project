We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Kauai Lawai Beach Resort C103.

We loved seeing the island chickens and the nightly parakeets flocking to roost in the trees.
We were across the street from the beach which was convenient to watch the sunset every night.

If you want to see some original cottages, just drive by.
Many locals stay there for parties with lots of people in one cottage - they receive nice discounts but do like to stay up late!
I would not go to Hawaii to swim in a pool but saw many people use theirs.
The beach was poor so no one was on it since you cannot swim.
They could have supplied bikes - that would have been a bonus. The distance to everything except Waimea Canyon is far but if you are planning on hiking the canyon daily it is your second best option (the first being cabins 1/2 way up the mountain).
You need a car since there is only one restaurant near by and the kitchen facilities are poor.
Hiking was great - would have been nice to stay where we could rent a paddle board or surfboards / boogie boards.
