TTanjaFromAustriaComing from Europe we fell in love with Napili beach during our honeymoon many years ago. The Mauian Hotel was the affordable solution for us with kids. We also didn't want one of those huge, anonymous places to stay and were not disappointed. The Mauian is one of the most beautiful resorts we have been to: lots of huge palm and plumeria trees. The vegetation shows that it is not a new resort but one that has been there for many many years.
The pool in the middle of the resort is not the newest or biggest but everybody meets there for barbecueing and sozialising. The beach is just perfect! Many guests revisit and know each other - very familiar and family orientated (which also means quite a lot of rules like e.g. pool hours annd quiet time)

If you have memories of before the fire, it is very, very sad to see the remains of buildings and know that over 100 people lost their lives.
The sentiment of Lahaina Strong is wonderful and uplifting but as you speak with residents, the current, somber message is that we will never regain what has been lost and there is no definitive plan or timeline for rebuilding.
You are asked to not take photos and to respect the area.

Everywhere is close while Wailuku has much to offer by itself.

I would’ve liked to travel to the different islands. It was hard to book a boat ride too expensive. I wish it was a little bit cheaper to do different events. I think everything is over price that’s what I didn’t like about this island.
