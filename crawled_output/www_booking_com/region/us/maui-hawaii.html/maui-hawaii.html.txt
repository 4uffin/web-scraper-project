KKatherineFromUnited StatesEverything about Hotel Wailea is amazing. The food is incredible - The Birdcage, The Restaurant, and even the poolside food. We also did the luxe picnic and that food was fantastic as well. The hotel really goes out of their way to provide a quiet, romantic, and unique experience. The suites are large, well furnished, and comfortable. There is even a small kitchen with nespresso, a toaster, microwave, plates and utensils, refrigerator, freezer, cups. No, it’s not on the beach… however, if you want to go, let them know which beach and they’ll provide you chairs and an umbrella and they’ll drop you off and come pick you up. It’s absolutely worth the price for the serenity: nothing is crowded, no fighting for pool chairs or dinner reservations.Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.59.5Exceptional - What previous guests thought, 146 reviewsExceptional 146 reviewsPrice from$1,0491 night, 2 adultsCheck availabilityHampton Inn & Suites Maui North ShoreHotel in KahuluiFacing the beachfront, Hampton Inn & Suites Maui North Shore offers 3-star accommodations in Kahului and features an outdoor swimming pool, shared lounge and terrace.

If you have memories of before the fire, it is very, very sad to see the remains of buildings and know that over 100 people lost their lives.
The sentiment of Lahaina Strong is wonderful and uplifting but as you speak with residents, the current, somber message is that we will never regain what has been lost and there is no definitive plan or timeline for rebuilding.
You are asked to not take photos and to respect the area.

I would’ve liked to travel to the different islands. It was hard to book a boat ride too expensive. I wish it was a little bit cheaper to do different events. I think everything is over price that’s what I didn’t like about this island. It’s very hard to plan outings with the big group of people we had 13 and we couldn’t afford to be doing all the different events with the group that big my other family stayed in a different resort but we wanted to stay all together, and it was very expensive to book.Show moreMGuest review byMelizaUnited States8.0It's a small town.It's a small town.
