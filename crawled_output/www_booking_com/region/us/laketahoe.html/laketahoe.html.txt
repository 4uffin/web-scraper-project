There is so much history at this Resort.
The "Base-to-Base" gondola opens up so much more terrain to ski.
The "Village" is nicely planned with shops and stores and great places to eat.
There is even a tiny Market to help stock the fridge (but only for quick items, essential).
If planing on staying up there for a week, also plan on going "into town" to purchase more grocery items (a car is needed)... UBER prices from Reno Airport are about $110.
LIMITED OR NO Uber services returning to Reno!!!
Cost to Return can be as high as $500.... If you Uber, get your drivers name and number; make an arrangement to contact that Uber driver and have them drive you back to Reno at the end of your vacation: Cash deal; off the books; it would be like a private limousine service. (about $125-$150)Show moreRGuest review byRoy10.0Gardnerville is a quiet little city adjoining Minden, 16...Gardnerville is a quiet little city adjoining Minden, 16 miles from Carson City, and just down the very steep Kingsbury Grade from Stateline and South Lake Tahoe. Bus service is good to all of these places, and a vehicle makes them more accessible. We took a side trip to Virginia City and saw wild horses. There is a lot of history here, restaurants and bakeries, and proximity to interesting places to visit.Show moreMGuest review byMargaretUnited StatesResearch, refine, and make plans for your whole tripHotels in the United StatesIf you're planning a longer trip, look beyond Lake Tahoe and explore the whole country!Car rental near Lake Tahoe AirportPick up your rental car as soon as you land.Hotels in Yosemite National ParkDiscover another popular destination in the United States.Hotels in Disney World AreaDiscover another popular destination in the United States.Cheap vacations in South Lake TahoeBook the best flights, stays, and more – all in one placeWhen to visit the United StatesEvents, prices, weather, and more.Cabins in Lake TahoeStill looking for the perfect place to stay?
