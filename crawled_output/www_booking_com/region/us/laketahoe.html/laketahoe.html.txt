PPedroFromGermanyRoom, services and location everything was perfect. We stayed for two nights in Truckee to discover the area around Lake Tahoe. The staff were very friendly and helpful. We used also in the morning the “Dryland (sport area)” to do some exercises and in the evening after hiking also the sauna and hot tub. The best thing was the good air, as Gravity Haus Truckee is located in nature. We can definitely recommend this place.Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.09.0Superb - What previous guests thought, 940 reviewsSuperb 940 reviewsLocation 9.3Price from£162.221 night, 2 adultsCheck availabilityBlack Bear LodgeHotel in South Lake TahoeBlack Bear Lodge is situated in South Lake Tahoe, roughly 0.8 km from the lake and 1.6 km from The Gondola at Heavenly.

There is so much history at this Resort.
The "Base-to-Base" gondola opens up so much more terrain to ski.
The "Village" is nicely planned with shops and stores and great places to eat.
There is even a tiny Market to help stock the fridge (but only for quick items, essential).
If planing on staying up there for a week, also plan on going "into town" to purchase more grocery items (a car is needed)... UBER prices from Reno Airport are about $110.
LIMITED OR NO Uber services returning to Reno!!!
Cost to Return can be as high as $500.... If you Uber, get your drivers name and number; make an arrangement to contact that Uber driver and have them drive you back to Reno at the end of your vacation: Cash deal; off the books; it would be like a private limousine service. (about $125-$150)Show moreRGuest review byRoy10.0Gardnerville is a quiet little city adjoining Minden, 16...Gardnerville is a quiet little city adjoining Minden, 16 miles from Carson City, and just down the very steep Kingsbury Grade from Stateline and South Lake Tahoe. Bus service is good to all of these places, and a vehicle makes them more accessible. We took a side trip to Virginia City and saw wild horses. There is a lot of history here, restaurants and bakeries, and proximity to interesting places to visit.Show moreMGuest review byMargaretUnited StatesResearch, refine and make plans for your whole tripHotels in South Lake TahoeThinking about which towns and cities to visit during your trip to Lake Tahoe?
