Harveys is being re-branded with a ton of construction.

There is so much history at this Resort.
The "Base-to-Base" gondola opens up so much more terrain to ski.
The "Village" is nicely planned with shops and stores and great places to eat.
There is even a tiny Market to help stock the fridge (but only for quick items, essential).
If planing on staying up there for a week, also plan on going "into town" to purchase more grocery items (a car is needed)... UBER prices from Reno Airport are about $110.
LIMITED OR NO Uber services returning to Reno!!!
Cost to Return can be as high as $500.... If you Uber, get your drivers name and number; make an arrangement to contact that Uber driver and have them drive you back to Reno at the end of your vacation: Cash deal; off the books; it would be like a private limousine service.

Bus service is good to all of these places, and a vehicle makes them more accessible. We took a side trip to Virginia City and saw wild horses. There is a lot of history here, restaurants and bakeries, and proximity to interesting places to visit.Show moreMGuest review byMargaretUnited StatesResearch, refine, and make plans for your whole tripHotels in the United StatesIf you're planning a longer trip, look beyond Lake Tahoe and explore the whole country!Hotels in Yosemite National ParkDiscover another popular destination in the United States.Hotels in Disney World AreaDiscover another popular destination in the United States.Cabins in Lake TahoeExplore more great accommodation options for your trip.Vacation Homes in Lake TahoeExplore more great accommodation options for your trip.Hotels in South Lake TahoeA popular choice with guests visiting Lake Tahoe.Hotels in TruckeeThinking about which towns and cities to visit during your trip to Lake Tahoe?
