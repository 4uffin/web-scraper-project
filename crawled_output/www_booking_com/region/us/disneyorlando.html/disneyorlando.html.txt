The attractions are conveniently located. Aquatica water park was only a 20-minute drive, and SeaWorld was just in between. The Old Town House is adorable and caters to all types of people. My family truly enjoyed every moment of our trip.Show moreOGuest review byOlibrice10.0We stayed in Orlando for two weeks this year, and one week...We stayed in Orlando for two weeks this year, and one week last year.
We visited a total of 12 different parks (all the Disney parks, Universal, SeaWorld, ICON Park, and Aquatica).
This really is the world capital of theme parks!
Orlando also has great food, shopping, and of course, amazing theme parks.
You’ll need a vehicle to get around—everything is just a few minutes’ drive, but not really walkableShow moreTGuest review byTomerIsrael10.0I love coming to Kissimmee. It has everything!I love coming to Kissimmee. It has everything! It's close to Disney, there are plenty of places to eat, you have Old Town amusement park, there are highways that take you straight to Universal Studios and Sea World, hundreds of hotels to choose from, shops, flea markets.... I could go on and on.Show moreDGuest review byDIANEUnited States8.0The Disney parks were great, but some of the rides are a bit...The Disney parks were great, but some of the rides are a bit old as we have been coming to Orlando for some years now and have seen them all.The new park at Universal was a bit of a let down ,we had to be in line for over 2 hours for a basic 2 minutes ride which was a copy of the one in Universal LA.some of the rides were broken down, for people in their 70's the stairs were abit of a trial.The food restaurants in Universal Epic were very good, Disney should improve theirs to the Epic standard.Show moreFGuest review byFrankIreland10.0Kissimmee is a great place for families of all ages.Kissimmee is a great place for families of all ages. The access to Disney and Universal is great and simple to get to. There are all of the fast food places as well as delicious sit-downs like Texas Roadhouse, which is a family favorite for us. There are so many attractions, live music events and free events around every corner. The traffic is terrible and getting around can be complicated for a first timer, but if you stay in the outskirts and can avoid the highways, life is easy.Show moreDGuest review byDavidUnited StatesResearch, refine, and make plans for your whole tripHotels near Walt Disney WorldFind hotels close to Walt Disney World, a popular tourist attraction for visitors heading to the same area of the United States.Hotels near Universal Studios OrlandoPlaces to stay with a popular tourist attraction nearby.Vacation Homes in Disney World AreaExplore more great accommodation options for your trip.Cheap hotels in Disney World AreaExplore more great accommodation options for your trip.Cheap vacations in OrlandoBook the best flights, stays, and more – all in one placeHotels in OrlandoA popular choice with guests visiting Disney World Area.Hotels in KissimmeeThinking about which towns and cities to visit during your trip to Disney World Area?
