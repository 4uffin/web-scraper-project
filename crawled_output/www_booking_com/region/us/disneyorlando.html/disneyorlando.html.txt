While we only visited the Universal parks, Disney is just around the corner from the property. There are many food venues near the rental, as well as numerous Pubix and Walmarts to pick up any necessities. The kitchen has everything needed for a quick meal at home, if you so desire. The swimming pool was available, although we did not have time to use it. The pool and deck were spotless, as was the whole house. Wonderful stay.Show moreEGuest review byENEIDAUnited States10.0We stayed in Orlando for two weeks this year, and one week...We stayed in Orlando for two weeks this year, and one week last year.
We visited a total of 12 different parks (all the Disney parks, Universal, SeaWorld, ICON Park, and Aquatica).
This really is the world capital of theme parks!
Orlando also has great food, shopping, and of course, amazing theme parks.

The attractions are conveniently located. Aquatica water park was only a 20-minute drive, and SeaWorld was just in between. The Old Town House is adorable and caters to all types of people. My family truly enjoyed every moment of our trip.Show moreOGuest review byOlibrice8.0The Disney parks were great, but some of the rides are a bit...The Disney parks were great, but some of the rides are a bit old as we have been coming to Orlando for some years now and have seen them all.The new park at Universal was a bit of a let down ,we had to be in line for over 2 hours for a basic 2 minutes ride which was a copy of the one in Universal LA.some of the rides were broken down, for people in their 70's the stairs were abit of a trial.The food restaurants in Universal Epic were very good, Disney should improve theirs to the Epic standard.Show moreFGuest review byFrankIreland10.0I love coming to Kissimmee.
