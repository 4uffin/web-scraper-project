The attractions are conveniently located. Aquatica water park was only a 20-minute drive, and SeaWorld was just in between. The Old Town House is adorable and caters to all types of people. My family truly enjoyed every moment of our trip.Show moreOGuest review byOlibrice8.0The Disney parks were great, but some of the rides are a bit...The Disney parks were great, but some of the rides are a bit old as we have been coming to Orlando for some years now and have seen them all.The new park at Universal was a bit of a let down ,we had to be in line for over 2 hours for a basic 2 minutes ride which was a copy of the one in Universal LA.some of the rides were broken down, for people in their 70's the stairs were abit of a trial.The food restaurants in Universal Epic were very good, Disney should improve theirs to the Epic standard.Show moreFGuest review byFrankIreland10.0I love coming to Kissimmee.
