JJoaoFromAustraliaSuch a comfy homey vibe, the owner Shem is an absolute LEGEND, we arrived late at night after a very long drive from the Grand Canyon in our West US road trip, and he welcomed us with some beers and a great chat around the beautiful wooden counter. Just what we needed after many nights at motels on the go. Next day he made the best eggs and bacon breakfast which got us the energy we needed for the next chapter of our trip.
We didn’t get the chance to explore the area as we had to make it to Vegas early in the day, but having stayed at this gem was one of the highlights of our trip.
Wishing the best for Shem and his wife! Hopefully see you again one day!

Loved the Toadstool Hoodoos which is located at the Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument just before getting into Kanab and it is only a 1.7 mi RT hike.
Loved Wild Thyme restaurant.
Had their salmon dish and we shared a delish dessert.
Went to Moqui Cave. Very interesting story of the lineage of the Hopi Cave told by the employees.
It is very touristy but very cool to check out and if you are into rocks, gems, Native American jewelry, it is a must stop.
They have wind caves there but didn’t have time for that.
A beautiful area.
Reminds me of a mini-Sedona.

If you go, just pay for the overpriced sky walk experience. Although it's a bit too expensive, given there are other free views, it's a must do if you're making the trip anyway. Don't stay at the Haupia Cabins; they're not good. Instead, you may want to stay in nearby Kingman, AZ and drive in to Grand Canyon West. This is a better option, trust me!Show moreJGuest review byJesse GuillenUnited States6.0Things are changing in Ash Fork A brand new gas station.Things are changing in Ash Fork A brand new gas station.
