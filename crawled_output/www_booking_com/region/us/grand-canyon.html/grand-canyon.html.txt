Over millennia the Colorado River has carved its way through over 250 miles of multi-layered rock and now lies over 1 mile below the canyon rim.The majority of hotels near the Grand Canyon are in historic Flagstaff, in a valley overlooked by mountains. Part of legendary Route 66 runs through here and continues to Seligman where you can still get your kicks and a good helping of kitsch. Between them is Williams, from where trains depart to Grand Canyon Village, home to some impressive South Rim lookouts.The closest Grand Canyon South Rim hotels on Booking.com are in Tusayan, from whose airport plane and helicopter rides take off. The moment you cross the canyon rim and see the ground suddenly drop away is absolutely breathtaking.More aircraft are in Valle museum to the south, while west is sleepy Peach Springs, capital of the Hualapai native people, through whose territory the Grand Canyon passes. Also on their land is the Skywalk where a U-shaped platform extends over the canyon, offering wonderful views of this Natural Wonder of the World as it gleams in the sun.On the opposite side is the less-visited Grand Canyon North Rim and its closest hotels are found in Kanab in Utah.See reviews by guests who stayed at hotels in Grand CanyonSee allGrand Canyon Inn and Motel - South Rim EntranceValleFrom £108.83 per nightScored out of 10, guest rating 6.76.7Pleasant - What previous guests thought, 5,141 reviews Pleasant · 5,141 reviewsThe reservation process was easy.

Loved the Toadstool Hoodoos which is located at the Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument just before getting into Kanab and it is only a 1.7 mi RT hike.
Loved Wild Thyme restaurant.
Had their salmon dish and we shared a delish dessert.
Went to Moqui Cave. Very interesting story of the lineage of the Hopi Cave told by the employees.
It is very touristy but very cool to check out and if you are into rocks, gems, Native American jewelry, it is a must stop.
They have wind caves there but didn’t have time for that.
A beautiful area.
Reminds me of a mini-Sedona. History of old Hollywood filming westerns in Kanab.Show moreKGuest review byKristin6.0Its isolated. 30 minutes from everywhere.Its isolated. 30 minutes from everywhere. I would recommend getting a place closer to the grand canyon, spend a little more money and you'll have more to do. We actually left early because we had our kids and there wasn't much to do in Valle.Show moreMGuest review byMo8.0Tuba City is a great location for starting a drive across...Tuba City is a great location for starting a drive across northern Arizona (and on into New Mexico).
This is a small town, but there is a restaurant at the hotel and several known places to eat there.
The hotel also has a trading post and other features, but we arrived too late to see those.Show moreOGuest review byO10.0We stopped at the Aztec on our way from California to New...We stopped at the Aztec on our way from California to New Mexico. We often do this route, but for some reason I always overlooked Seligman for a stop. I'm so happy we decided to stay there! The motel is very nice, clean and recently renovated, the breakfast was really appreciated. The surroundings are nice and quiet, and the hosts are very welcoming!Show moreAGuest review byAlexandraUnited States10.0Hildale is a beautiful little town.Hildale is a beautiful little town.
The border Store on the edge of the state border with Arizona is a great little gem - the people are so friendly and the store is well equipped.
I loved this little town and would highly recommend it.Show morekGuest review bykynanceAustralia10.0Peach Springs is amazing with plenty of panoramic views,...Peach Springs is amazing with plenty of panoramic views, especially the grand canyon west tour that comes with general admission to the area. If you go, just pay for the overpriced sky walk experience. Although it's a bit too expensive, given there are other free views, it's a must do if you're making the trip anyway. Don't stay at the Haupia Cabins; they're not good. Instead, you may want to stay in nearby Kingman, AZ and drive in to Grand Canyon West. This is a better option, trust me!Show moreJGuest review byJesse GuillenUnited States6.0Things are changing in Ash Fork A brand new gas station.Things are changing in Ash Fork A brand new gas station.
