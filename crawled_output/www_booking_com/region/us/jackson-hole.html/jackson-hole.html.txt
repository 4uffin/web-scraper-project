Loved this hotel!!
The location is excellent, right in the center of town (but quiet).
The hotel is beautiful and super comfortable (the rooms, the library, even the business/conference room), and the staff is super attentive to every detail.
We stayed for five nights and were so pleased with everything.
We used the hot tub on the roof (at sunset with light snowflakes drifting down and beautiful views of the mountains).
Wonderful daily touches like beautiful packages of chocolates every evening, a welcome half bottle of wine and handwritten note upon arrival, coffee station every morning (in addition to good nespresso machine in room) which becomes a tea station every afternoon and evening complete with home baked treats daily, and a hot chocolate bar set out as well!
Honestly, a lovely small hotel with impeccable service.
They offer a shuttle to the ski slopes too, which we didn’t use this trip.Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.49.4Wonderful - What previous guests thought, 120 reviewsWonderful 120 reviewsPrice from$5291 night, 2 adultsCheck availabilityWyoming Inn of Jackson HoleHotel in JacksonThis Jackson Hole hotel features western-style décor, a lobby fireplace and a well-equipped gym.

Colter Bay Village had a general store and a good restaurant as promised.
However, the cabin for $380.00 was only a room with attached small bathroom.
The bathroom had a shower with dirty, moldy caulking in the shower and around the bathroom. The cabin had no refrigerator, no television, no wifi, just bed(s) with a stain on our sheets. The pictures on Booking.com were great and they talked a lot about Colter Bay Village but no where did they mention how RUSTIC and lacking the cabin was.
