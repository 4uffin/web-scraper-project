Unfortunately, there was flash flooding the day before we arrived and many of the roads were closed, with the exception of the main roads. If you hike one day in the park is not enough.

We were in the area for the Ron Fellows Driving School but we did try to explore the area while we were there. One big negative for us was that only 1 casino offers table games and those are limited.Show moreBGuest review byBethanyUnited States6.0Staff were friendly and helpful.Staff were friendly and helpful.

There are several other larger towns within reasonable driving distance if you want more restaurants, grocery stores, etc. The main reason to be here is to visit Death Valley National Park -- which is beyond amazing.
El Valle Mexican restaurant (which is really in Amargosa Valley, NV) is really good.Show moreAGuest review byAdamUnited States10.0Unique place - it includes 'Badwater Basin' - about 30 mins'...Unique place - it includes 'Badwater Basin' - about 30 mins' drive from the Inn at Death Valley. Badwater Basin is the lowest point in the whole of North America and is 85 metres BELOW sea level. A massive salt flat stretching as far as the eye can see and very, very hot in July.
Death Valley area also includes Zabriskie Point overlooking the Bad Lands of the desert. We came upon it by chance on the way to the Inn (10-15 mins up the road) and stopped off to walk the short 'stroll' in the afternoon heat to the viewpoint. Very well worth the effort!Show moreNGuest review byNickUnited Kingdom10.0Don't miss this place.Don't miss this place.
