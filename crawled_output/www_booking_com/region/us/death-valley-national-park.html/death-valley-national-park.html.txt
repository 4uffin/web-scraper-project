IIngridFromSlovakia– The location inside Death Valley National Park was perfect for stargazing and sunrise watching – no long drives needed!
– The resort is a hidden gem right in the desert, surrounded by palm trees and green grass – surprisingly lush and luxurious.
– Late-night arrival (after midnight) was smooth – check-in was easy, and the receptionist provided a map and clear directions.
– The automated system for check-in, check-out, and information was modern and convenient.
– We were likely upgraded from a Standard Queen Room to a Cottage with a King bed – a huge thank you!
– The Cottage was amazing – it had two separate suites, each with a private entrance, and we had the whole place to ourselves.
– Our suite had a living room and bedroom, air conditioning (not too noisy), and ceiling fans in both rooms.
– We had a microwave, fridge, and coffee maker – and even a combined washing machine and tumble dryer, which was above American hotel standard!
– USB and USB-C ports were built into the bedside tables – a great modern touch.
– The rooms were stylish, comfortable, and nicely decorated.
– The resort grounds were beautifully lit at night, making the whole place look magical.
– There was a private patio with chairs and a table (although it was too hot to use during our stay).
– The Borax Museum on site is definitely worth a visit – very interesting and well-maintained.Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 7.97.9Good - What previous guests thought, 7,486 reviewsGood 7,486 reviewsPrice from$215.991 night, 2 adultsCheck availabilityBest Western Pahrump OasisHotel in PahrumpDeath Valley is 1 hours’ drive from Best Western Pahrump Oasis.

Get inspired by reviews of cities in Death Valley National Park10.0Unique place - it includes 'Badwater Basin' - about 30 mins'...Unique place - it includes 'Badwater Basin' - about 30 mins' drive from the Inn at Death Valley. Badwater Basin is the lowest point in the whole of North America and is 85 metres BELOW sea level. A massive salt flat stretching as far as the eye can see and very, very hot in July.
Death Valley area also includes Zabriskie Point overlooking the Bad Lands of the desert. We came upon it by chance on the way to the Inn (10-15 mins up the road) and stopped off to walk the short 'stroll' in the afternoon heat to the viewpoint. Very well worth the effort!Show moreNGuest review byNickUnited Kingdom10.0I like being able to tune into the NHL playoff game between...I like being able to tune into the NHL playoff game between the Oilers and Golden Knights at the local bar.
