The beaches are beautiful and not over crowded.
There were many great places to eat, we enjoyed Parlor Donuts, Beignet and Brews, Lulus, and the Backporch.
Also great shopping.
We did a lot school clothes shopping while we were there. Both Destin Commons and Destin Outlets had great stores.
We also went to the Gulfarium and our girls did the Penguin Encounter which was a lot of fun for them.
Oveall, we had a great trip and are already planning our next to Destin.Show moreHGuest review byHallieUnited StatesResearch, refine, and make plans for your whole tripVillas in FloridaStill looking for the perfect place to stay?
