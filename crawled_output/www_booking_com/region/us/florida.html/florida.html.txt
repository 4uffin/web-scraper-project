In comparison to 2018 when I visited Miami too, I noticed that there were more people working in shops and even at the airport who couldn’t communicate in English. Though I respect people talking their motherlanguages, I feel that we couldn’t understand anything they said in SpanishShow moreKGuest review byKalyanSuriname10.0My group was there mid September, the weather was good, low...My group was there mid September, the weather was good, low to mid 80s so not horribly hot. I loved the window shopping on Washington Ave and the Lincoln Road outdoor Mall. Spis restaurant was a great find for for bargain eats, cruising Ocean Drive at night watching the young folks going to bars and just hanging out on the Beach too.Show moreYGuest review byYvetteUnited States10.0To be a big city in Florida, it actually had a small town...To be a big city in Florida, it actually had a small town feel, with the specialty restaurants like Columbia and Bern, the River Walk, the oldest cigar factory in the Country, a plethora of attractions, like the aquarium and Mariners museum.Show moreBGuest review byBennett8.0We arrived at PCB on a Thursday afternoon.We arrived at PCB on a Thursday afternoon. First stop was - Harpoon Harry's, - which is beside the Chateau by the beach Resort. The Seafood platter was enough for three. Next, we were off to Putt-Putt Golf, but noticed the new Golf Center. Wow, that place was great!
Strolling through the Pier Park shops, I picked up several souvenirs and some clearance summer items to take back home. I was pleasantly tired when we returned to the Chateau, so the Tikki bar was nice to sit by the pool, relax, have a cool beverage, and make dinner plans. Speaking of food, I must give a shout-out to the Waffle Houses of PCB! Brunch, to me, is the best meal of the day.Show moreKGuest review byKimUnited States10.0It is great the weekend I went had a great air show with...It is great the weekend I went had a great air show with Blue Angels flying in the sky. It adheres to multiple vibes even the club scene to go dancing or the family- bike rentals are available enough restaurants on the strip and one of the Best Pizza shops in Broward not like Chicago or New York pizza but still good and large in serving.Show moreMGuest review byMilagroUnited States6.0It is a bigger city than I realized and more spread out so I...It is a bigger city than I realized and more spread out so I found that staying in northern Jacksonville was not the right area of the city for me and I ended up having to do a lot of driving. I think I prefer the southern Jacksonville, Nocatee, Jax beach or Ponte Vedra beach areas.Show moreKGuest review byKimUnited States10.0The location of our rental property was centrally located (...The location of our rental property was centrally located ( 20-30 min drive)to all of the theme parks. While we only visited the Universal parks, Disney is just around the corner from the property. There are many food venues near the rental, as well as numerous Pubix and Walmarts to pick up any necessities. The kitchen has everything needed for a quick meal at home, if you so desire. The swimming pool was available, although we did not have time to use it. The pool and deck were spotless, as was the whole house. Wonderful stay.Show moreEGuest review byENEIDAUnited States8.0It was our first time in Key West, we had a great time.It was our first time in Key West, we had a great time.
Eating & drinking can get expensive if you are not going during happy hour. Some of the restaurants put an automatic gratuity/service fee on the bill. I hate this sort of practice & will not return to that establishment. I guess September is off season, so a lot of places were closed. For being off season parking is horrible & parking lots are $6-$10 per hour.Show moreEGuest review byErleneUnited States10.0This was our first trip to Destin.This was our first trip to Destin.
The beaches are beautiful and not over crowded.
There were many great places to eat, we enjoyed Parlor Donuts, Beignet and Brews, Lulus, and the Backporch.
Also great shopping.
We did a lot school clothes shopping while we were there. Both Destin Commons and Destin Outlets had great stores.
We also went to the Gulfarium and our girls did the Penguin Encounter which was a lot of fun for them.
Oveall, we had a great trip and are already planning our next to Destin.Show moreHGuest review byHallieUnited StatesResearch, refine, and make plans for your whole tripCheap vacations in OrlandoPlan everything you need for your vacation in one place – from flights and stays to tours and activitiesHotels in the United StatesSet off to explore the whole country.Hotels in OrlandoA popular choice with guests visiting Florida.Hotels in MiamiA popular choice with guests visiting Florida.When to visit the United StatesEvents, prices, weather, and more.Hotels in Disney World AreaTake a look at properties in a destination nearby.Hotels in Florida KeysThinking about a longer trip?
