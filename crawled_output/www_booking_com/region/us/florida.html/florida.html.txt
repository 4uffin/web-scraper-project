In comparison to 2018 when I visited Miami too, I noticed that there were more people working in shops and even at the airport who couldn’t communicate in English. Though I respect people talking their motherlanguages, I feel that we couldn’t understand anything they said in SpanishShow moreKGuest review byKalyanSuriname10.0My group was there mid September, the weather was good, low...My group was there mid September, the weather was good, low to mid 80s so not horribly hot. I loved the window shopping on Washington Ave and the Lincoln Road outdoor Mall. Spis restaurant was a great find for for bargain eats, cruising Ocean Drive at night watching the young folks going to bars and just hanging out on the Beach too.Show moreYGuest review byYvetteUnited States10.0To be a big city in Florida, it actually had a small town...To be a big city in Florida, it actually had a small town feel, with the specialty restaurants like Columbia and Bern, the River Walk, the oldest cigar factory in the Country, a plethora of attractions, like the aquarium and Mariners museum.Show moreBGuest review byBennett10.0Great place lots to do but I would not recommend hooters...Great place lots to do but I would not recommend hooters there food was awful i wondered why parking was half empty usually that place is packed and my family has ate there a lot in past years won’t be going back there sandbar was good and sharkys was great and there’s so many more.

I think I prefer the southern Jacksonville, Nocatee, Jax beach or Ponte Vedra beach areas.Show moreKGuest review byKimUnited States10.0The location of our rental property was centrally located (...The location of our rental property was centrally located ( 20-30 min drive)to all of the theme parks. While we only visited the Universal parks, Disney is just around the corner from the property. There are many food venues near the rental, as well as numerous Pubix and Walmarts to pick up any necessities. The kitchen has everything needed for a quick meal at home, if you so desire. The swimming pool was available, although we did not have time to use it. The pool and deck were spotless, as was the whole house. Wonderful stay.Show moreEGuest review byENEIDAUnited States10.0Loved Sloppy Joes.Loved Sloppy Joes. We took a sunset cruise on the Commotion on the Ocean, sooooo much fun! Rented a golf cart to get around.
took in many shops. Being in our 80s, we chose not to swim or lay around in our bikinis! Everything was topped off with a wonderful stay at the Truman House!Show morecGuest review bycamden10.0This was our first trip to Destin.This was our first trip to Destin.
The beaches are beautiful and not over crowded.
There were many great places to eat, we enjoyed Parlor Donuts, Beignet and Brews, Lulus, and the Backporch.
Also great shopping.
We did a lot school clothes shopping while we were there. Both Destin Commons and Destin Outlets had great stores.
We also went to the Gulfarium and our girls did the Penguin Encounter which was a lot of fun for them.
Oveall, we had a great trip and are already planning our next to Destin.Show moreHGuest review byHallieUnited StatesResearch, refine, and make plans for your whole tripHotels near Walt Disney WorldFind hotels close to Walt Disney World, a popular tourist attraction for visitors heading to the same area of the United States.Hotels near Universal Studios OrlandoPlaces to stay with a popular tourist attraction nearby.Car rental near Miami International AirportPick up your rental car as soon as you land.Villas in FloridaExplore more great accommodation options for your trip.Inns in FloridaExplore more great accommodation options for your trip.When to visit the United StatesEvents, prices, weather, and more.Flights to FloridaGet your flight tickets to Florida right here on Booking.com.Hotels in Yosemite National ParkDiscover another popular destination in the United States.Hotels in New JerseyDiscover another popular destination in the United States.Show moreCountriesRegionsCitiesDistrictsAirportsHotelsPlaces of interestVacation HomesApartmentsResortsVillasHostelsB&BsGuest HousesUnique places to stayAll destinationsAll flight destinationsAll car rental locationsAll vacation destinationsGuidesDiscoverReviewsDiscover monthly staysSupportCoronavirus (COVID-19) FAQsManage your tripsContact Customer ServiceSafety Resource CenterDiscoverGenius loyalty programSeasonal and holiday dealsTravel articlesBooking.com for BusinessTraveller Review AwardsCar rentalFlight finderRestaurant reservationsBooking.com for Travel AgentsTerms and settingsPrivacy & cookiesTerms of ServiceAccessibility StatementDispute resolutionModern Slavery StatementHuman Rights StatementPartnersExtranet loginPartner helpList your propertyBecome an affiliateAboutAbout Booking.comHow We WorkSustainabilityPress centerCareersInvestor relationsCorporate contactContent guidelines and reportingUSDBooking.com is part of Booking Holdings Inc., the world leader in online travel and related services.
