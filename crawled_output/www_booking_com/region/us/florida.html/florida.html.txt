The restaurant food wasn't that good and wasn't worth the price. Plus they automatically add gratuity on your bill regardless of the service.Show moreLGuest review byLisaUnited States10.0My group was there mid September, the weather was good, low...My group was there mid September, the weather was good, low to mid 80s so not horribly hot. I loved the window shopping on Washington Ave and the Lincoln Road outdoor Mall. Spis restaurant was a great find for for bargain eats, cruising Ocean Drive at night watching the young folks going to bars and just hanging out on the Beach too.Show moreYGuest review byYvetteUnited States10.0It's a great city with lots to see.It's a great city with lots to see. From The Sea Aquarium to The Hard Rock hotel and casino and of course Bush Gardens. The best retail therapy with Hyde Park and International Plaza. The traffic was crazy there. I thought Orlando was bad this city might be a little worse. You'd better be in the right lane for turning or you'll never get in.Show morejGuest review byjudeUnited States6.0The room needs cleaning and painting and in some repairs and...The room needs cleaning and painting and in some repairs and the elevator needed the same.

I think I prefer the southern Jacksonville, Nocatee, Jax beach or Ponte Vedra beach areas.Show moreKGuest review byKimUnited States10.0Personally, I am very easy to please, and Kissimmee was...Personally, I am very easy to please, and Kissimmee was exactly what my family needed. The attractions are conveniently located. Aquatica water park was only a 20-minute drive, and SeaWorld was just in between. The Old Town House is adorable and caters to all types of people. My family truly enjoyed every moment of our trip.Show moreOGuest review byOlibrice10.0Loved Sloppy Joes.Loved Sloppy Joes. We took a sunset cruise on the Commotion on the Ocean, sooooo much fun!

The beaches are beautiful and not over crowded.
There were many great places to eat, we enjoyed Parlor Donuts, Beignet and Brews, Lulus, and the Backporch.
Also great shopping.
We did a lot school clothes shopping while we were there. Both Destin Commons and Destin Outlets had great stores.
We also went to the Gulfarium and our girls did the Penguin Encounter which was a lot of fun for them.
Oveall, we had a great trip and are already planning our next to Destin.Show moreHGuest review byHallieUnited StatesResearch, refine and make plans for your whole tripHotels near Miami International AirportFind hotels conveniently close to the area's most popular airport – perfect for a late arrival or early departure.Hotels near Orlando International AirportPerfect for a late arrival or early departure.Hotels in OrlandoA popular choice with guests visiting Florida.Hotels in MiamiA popular choice with guests visiting Florida.Car hire near Miami International AirportPick up your rental car as soon as you touch down.When to visit the United StatesEvents, prices, the weather and more.Hotels in Yosemite National ParkHit the road and make the most of your trip by discovering another popular destination within the United States.Hotels in New JerseyDiscover another popular destination within the United States.Villas in FloridaExplore more great accommodation options for your trip.Show moreCountriesRegionsCitiesDistrictsAirportsHotelsPlaces of interestHoliday HomesApartmentsResortsVillasHostelsB&BsGuest HousesUnique places to stayAll destinationsAll flight destinationsAll car hire locationsAll holiday destinationsGuidesDiscoverReviewsDiscover monthly staysSupportCoronavirus (COVID-19) FAQsManage your tripsContact Customer ServiceSafety resource centreDiscoverGenius loyalty programmeSeasonal and holiday dealsTravel articlesBooking.com for BusinessTraveller Review AwardsCar hireFlight finderRestaurant reservationsBooking.com for Travel AgentsTerms and settingsManage cookie settingsPrivacy & cookiesTerms of ServiceAccessibility StatementDispute resolutionModern Slavery StatementHuman Rights StatementPartnersExtranet loginPartner helpList your propertyBecome an affiliateAboutAbout Booking.comHow we workSustainabilityPress centreCareersInvestor relationsCorporate contactGBPBooking.com is part of Booking Holdings Inc., the world leader in online travel and related services.
