This really is the world capital of theme parks!
Orlando also has great food, shopping, and of course, amazing theme parks.

I loved the window shopping on Washington Ave and the Lincoln Road outdoor Mall. Spis restaurant was a great find for for bargain eats, cruising Ocean Drive at night watching the young folks going to bars and just hanging out on the Beach too.Show moreYGuest review byYvetteUnited States10.0The water was very clear, and the sand was brilliant white.The water was very clear, and the sand was brilliant white.

From The Sea Aquarium to The Hard Rock hotel and casino and of course Bush Gardens. The best retail therapy with Hyde Park and International Plaza. The traffic was crazy there. I thought Orlando was bad this city might be a little worse. You'd better be in the right lane for turning or you'll never get in.Show morejGuest review byjudeUnited States10.0It is great the weekend I went had a great air show with...It is great the weekend I went had a great air show with Blue Angels flying in the sky. It adheres to multiple vibes even the club scene to go dancing or the family- bike rentals are available enough restaurants on the strip and one of the Best Pizza shops in Broward not like Chicago or New York pizza but still good and large in serving.Show moreMGuest review byMilagroUnited States6.0It is a bigger city than I realized and more spread out so I...It is a bigger city than I realized and more spread out so I found that staying in northern Jacksonville was not the right area of the city for me and I ended up having to do a lot of driving. I think I prefer the southern Jacksonville, Nocatee, Jax beach or Ponte Vedra beach areas.Show moreKGuest review byKimUnited States10.0Personally, I am very easy to please, and Kissimmee was...Personally, I am very easy to please, and Kissimmee was exactly what my family needed. The attractions are conveniently located. Aquatica water park was only a 20-minute drive, and SeaWorld was just in between. The Old Town House is adorable and caters to all types of people. My family truly enjoyed every moment of our trip.Show moreOGuest review byOlibrice10.0Place is life changing.Place is life changing. There’s not as much hate, more unity between people as a whole. Lots of history, LOTS of drinking. Fat Tuesdays and hogs breath saloon are great. Katie’s was great for brunch. Awesome food and great locals. The aquarium was awesome and the history is so cool. As a local to Florida I can’t think of a more homey place. ONE HUMAN FAMILY!Show moreGGuest review byGinaUnited States10.0This was our first trip to Destin.This was our first trip to Destin.
The beaches are beautiful and not over crowded.
There were many great places to eat, we enjoyed Parlor Donuts, Beignet and Brews, Lulus, and the Backporch.
Also great shopping.
We did a lot school clothes shopping while we were there. Both Destin Commons and Destin Outlets had great stores.
We also went to the Gulfarium and our girls did the Penguin Encounter which was a lot of fun for them.
Oveall, we had a great trip and are already planning our next to Destin.Show moreHGuest review byHallieUnited StatesResearch, refine, and make plans for your whole tripHotels near Miami International AirportFind hotels conveniently close to the area's most popular airport – perfect for a late arrival or early departure.Hotels near Orlando International AirportPerfect for a late arrival or early departure.When to visit the United StatesEvents, prices, weather, and more.Flights to FloridaGetting to Florida just got easier!Hotels in Yosemite National ParkDiscover another popular destination in the United States.Hotels in New JerseyDiscover another popular destination in the United States.Hotels in Disney World AreaThinking about a longer trip?
