The restaurant food wasn't that good and wasn't worth the price. Plus they automatically add gratuity on your bill regardless of the service.Show moreLGuest review byLisaUnited States10.0My group was there mid September, the weather was good, low...My group was there mid September, the weather was good, low to mid 80s so not horribly hot. I loved the window shopping on Washington Ave and the Lincoln Road outdoor Mall. Spis restaurant was a great find for for bargain eats, cruising Ocean Drive at night watching the young folks going to bars and just hanging out on the Beach too.Show moreYGuest review byYvetteUnited States10.0It's a great city with lots to see.It's a great city with lots to see. From The Sea Aquarium to The Hard Rock hotel and casino and of course Bush Gardens. The best retail therapy with Hyde Park and International Plaza. The traffic was crazy there. I thought Orlando was bad this city might be a little worse. You'd better be in the right lane for turning or you'll never get in.Show morejGuest review byjudeUnited States10.0Great place lots to do but I would not recommend hooters...Great place lots to do but I would not recommend hooters there food was awful i wondered why parking was half empty usually that place is packed and my family has ate there a lot in past years won’t be going back there sandbar was good and sharkys was great and there’s so many more.

I think I prefer the southern Jacksonville, Nocatee, Jax beach or Ponte Vedra beach areas.Show moreKGuest review byKimUnited States10.0Personally, I am very easy to please, and Kissimmee was...Personally, I am very easy to please, and Kissimmee was exactly what my family needed. The attractions are conveniently located. Aquatica water park was only a 20-minute drive, and SeaWorld was just in between. The Old Town House is adorable and caters to all types of people. My family truly enjoyed every moment of our trip.Show moreOGuest review byOlibrice10.0Loved Sloppy Joes.Loved Sloppy Joes. We took a sunset cruise on the Commotion on the Ocean, sooooo much fun!

The beaches are beautiful and not over crowded.
There were many great places to eat, we enjoyed Parlor Donuts, Beignet and Brews, Lulus, and the Backporch.
Also great shopping.
We did a lot school clothes shopping while we were there. Both Destin Commons and Destin Outlets had great stores.
We also went to the Gulfarium and our girls did the Penguin Encounter which was a lot of fun for them.
Oveall, we had a great trip and are already planning our next to Destin.Show moreHGuest review byHallieUnited StatesResearch, refine, and make plans for your whole tripHotels in Disney World AreaThinking about a longer trip?
