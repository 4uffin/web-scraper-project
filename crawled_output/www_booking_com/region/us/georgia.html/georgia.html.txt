Having travelled from England we arrived late at night to be greeted by Garrett who was friendly and informative, this I now understand to be the wonderful Southern hospitality everyone mentions which we also experienced from all the reception & Oaks staff, especially the 2 lovely ladies who served us breakfast. (Sorry we didn't get to see you on our last day, we slept in late then had to rush off)
Our room was spacious & comfortable, I didn't use the AC as I find it plays havoc with my breathing so opted for the large ceiling fan which was ample for our needs.
The bed was so huge you need a sat nav to move around it :)
We met a lovely couple in the Oaks bar who mentioned to us that the building will be going through a makeover which is possibly well needed however I had no complaints to make about the decor.
We spent quite a lot of time in the gardens and on the pier with beautiful views of the mountains & lake.
Overall we had an excellent stay which was possibly one of the finest of my 57 years on this Earth.Show moreAGuest review byAntsjjjUnited KingdomMountain Top Inn and ResortWarm SpringsFrom £121.45 per nightScored out of 10, guest rating 8.28.2Very good - What previous guests thought, 288 reviews Very good · 288 reviewsMy entire stay was wonderful.

From the Cumberland Mall to STK, to a Rooftop bar, to the Botanical Gardens, to Atlantic Station, to a concert at Maple House Amphitheater, to The Battery,
to Ponce City Market, JR Crickets, it was all exceptional experiences! Especially our stay at The Crown Plaza (Perimeter) the inside was just as beautiful as the outside. We enjoyed just hanging out at the bar & the best surprise was exploring the beautiful nature trails out back!

The Hop On Hop Off trolley is a fun way to get around if you're short on time.

The show was well-casted and professionally performed. The museum was very moving and educational. The displays were some of the best I’ve seen.
There’s quite a variety of shopping and restaurants on exit 10. We stayed at the courtyard by the airport and it was a good location to go north or south for any of our events this weekend.
You don’t need a lot of time in Columbus; a weekend will do. Check for events online before going and plan ahead.Show moresGuest review bystacyUnited States2.0The room had a funny smell for one two when I got in at 5...The room had a funny smell for one two when I got in at 5 o’clock in the morning from working all night I went to take a shower open the bottom cabinet and roaches all over the place and three gunshots about 5:30 in the morning so I checked out immediatelyShow moreCGuest review byCarlUnited States10.0Absolutely love Duluth, if you’re a fan of asian cuisine and...Absolutely love Duluth, if you’re a fan of asian cuisine and culture you’ll love it.

You can park your car and walk everywhere. Dining is great as well. Many different choices to pick from for the picky eater. A lot of German foods and items within the town. We go during Oktoberfest and enjoy the bands at the Fest Halle.
The Chattahoochee is a great place to go tubing. They also have a Mountain Coaster for your group. There is a lot to do rather you are older or younger, there is something for you to do.Show moreVGuest review byVeraUnited States10.0I was there for my daughter”s graduation.I was there for my daughter”s graduation.
