I had to pay at the hotel for another room because l was too tired to drive anymore. Plus l paid a higher rate...so l will never this chain again. They are a rip off. The clerk told me they had been having trouble with booking.com l think it was all a scamShow moreJGuest review byJohnson10.0Helen, GA is Bavarian-themed mountain town.Helen, GA is Bavarian-themed mountain town. You can park your car and walk everywhere. Dining is great as well. Many different choices to pick from for the picky eater. A lot of German foods and items within the town. We go during Oktoberfest and enjoy the bands at the Fest Halle.
The Chattahoochee is a great place to go tubing. They also have a Mountain Coaster for your group. There is a lot to do rather you are older or younger, there is something for you to do.Show moreVGuest review byVeraUnited States10.0I was there for my daughter”s graduation.I was there for my daughter”s graduation.
