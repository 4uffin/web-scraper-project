The show was well-casted and professionally performed. The museum was very moving and educational. The displays were some of the best I’ve seen.
There’s quite a variety of shopping and restaurants on exit 10. We stayed at the courtyard by the airport and it was a good location to go north or south for any of our events this weekend.
You don’t need a lot of time in Columbus; a weekend will do. Check for events online before going and plan ahead.Show moresGuest review bystacyUnited States10.0Absolutely love Duluth, if you’re a fan of asian cuisine and...Absolutely love Duluth, if you’re a fan of asian cuisine and culture you’ll love it. J’s mini hot pot is to die for and good price per person.

You can park your car and walk everywhere. Dining is great as well. Many different choices to pick from for the picky eater. A lot of German foods and items within the town. We go during Oktoberfest and enjoy the bands at the Fest Halle.
The Chattahoochee is a great place to go tubing. They also have a Mountain Coaster for your group. There is a lot to do rather you are older or younger, there is something for you to do.Show moreVGuest review byVeraUnited States10.0I was there for my daughter”s graduation.I was there for my daughter”s graduation.
