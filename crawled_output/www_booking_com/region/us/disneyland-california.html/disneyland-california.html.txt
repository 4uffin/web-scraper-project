There's even a gym for those who are into that sort of thing. Close enough to Anaheim that you can at any of the local attractions in less than 30 minutes.Show moreBGuest review byBlaz2.0This location refused to honor my reservation.This location refused to honor my reservation. Very biased behavior. I was dressed very plain. In the process of relocating and opening an office. I think the mgt misjudged me as homeless or poor ? Not sure but the service was horrible. My reservation was refused to re check because it was an hour late...,.noon. Opposed to 11am. Neverminded the fact, I had to leave my office and drive and hour back to the location to check in at noon. Very rude and considering legal action.Show moreIGuest review byIt'smyvibeUnited StatesResearch, refine and make plans for your whole tripCar hire near John Wayne AirportFlying in to John Wayne Airport and need to hire a car?
