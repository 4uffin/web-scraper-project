The late check out is important to me because I normally do not feel well in the mornings.
In room coffee is not available but who really likes that anyway?
The TV was upgraded and very nice.
Best of all is the family that owns and runs this little motel.
The owner is one of the kindest men and he is so accommodating.
He and the family are just the best.

There's even a gym for those who are into that sort of thing. Close enough to Anaheim that you can at any of the local attractions in less than 30 minutes.Show moreBGuest review byBlaz2.0This location refused to honor my reservation.This location refused to honor my reservation. Very biased behavior. I was dressed very plain. In the process of relocating and opening an office. I think the mgt misjudged me as homeless or poor ? Not sure but the service was horrible. My reservation was refused to re check because it was an hour late...,.noon. Opposed to 11am. Neverminded the fact, I had to leave my office and drive and hour back to the location to check in at noon. Very rude and considering legal action.Show moreIGuest review byIt'smyvibeUnited StatesResearch, refine, and make plans for your whole tripCar rental near John Wayne AirportFlying in to John Wayne Airport and need to rent a car?
