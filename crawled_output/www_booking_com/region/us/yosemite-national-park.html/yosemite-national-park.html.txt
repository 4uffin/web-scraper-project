The bar/grill are ok, certainly better than the restaurant, but that is speaking relatively... The store is very nice, offering a good variety of snacks and drinks. The location is very good, just a few miles away from the Yosemite entrance. The staff were friendly and responsive. The rooms were clean, and, thankfully, the AC worked well (it was 109 degrees when we were there!). The bathroom lights turned on automatically whenever someone entered the room, which we didn't like, and would have liked a way to turn that feature off.Show moreNGuest review byNeckmanUnited States10.0The lovely family at the Berkshire Inn made our three days...The lovely family at the Berkshire Inn made our three days and nights there just perfect.

There's a few nice restaurants within Curry Village, including a bar (get the smashed burger), a pizza stall, and a dining hall-style canteen. There's also a small grocery store and outdoor gear store where you can buy anything you forgot to bring on the trip.
