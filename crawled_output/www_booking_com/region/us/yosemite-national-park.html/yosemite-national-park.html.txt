Half Dome is its most famous peak and there is a hiking route up if you’ve got the energy.At its feet is Yosemite Village, home to the only Yosemite hotels inside the park. Nearby is sheer El Capitan, popular with rock climbers, and the Cathedral Rocks where the Bridalveil Fall plummets to the ground. The Tunnel View observation point offers magnificent views of all this.The Yosemite Falls are the highest in North America, but the park’s real beauty is just being surrounded by immaculate nature. From summer to winter Yosemite has a special draw attracting visitors year after year. It also attracts a wide range of native American wildlife including black bears, mountain beavers and coyotes.South-west of the park is the forest of giant sequoias at Mariposa Grove. Mariposa itself is by Yosemite Airport and Oakhurst to the south has a good range of accommodation. El Portal has the closest hotels to Yosemite. On the eastern side, June Lake and Mammoth Lakes also have Yosemite hotels near the park available on Booking.com. Wherever you stay, bear in mind that some roads do get closed in case of heavy snow.See reviews by guests who stayed at hotels in Yosemite National ParkSee allChukchansi Gold Resort & CasinoCoarsegoldFrom £190.78 per nightScored out of 10, guest rating 7.67.6Good - What previous guests thought, 507 reviews Good · 507 reviewsThis was a last minute booking enroute from Yosemite to LA.
