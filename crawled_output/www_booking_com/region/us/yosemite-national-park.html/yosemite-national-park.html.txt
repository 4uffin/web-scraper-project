The property is huge, the cabins are so cute and clean, the online check-in and check-out is super convenient and the location is perfect, very close to Yosemite with a fair price. Definitely want to come back in the future and get the bigger cabin. The room was super clean and comfortable, The shared bathroom was always clean and had all the supplies and toiletries necessary.
