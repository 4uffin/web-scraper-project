The location is not too far from the park, and the drive to get there is scenic and enjoyable. We loved having a kitchenette, which made meals convenient. The onsite restaurant was decent for the location—though we visited in the off-season, so it might be even better during peak times.
The property felt safe, and one of the highlights was being able to hear the river—it was incredibly soothing. There are nice hangout areas by the river, complete with swings and other relaxing spots. Overall, the atmosphere was tranquil. Bonus points for the dog-friendly features, like a designated dog park and poop bag stations.
