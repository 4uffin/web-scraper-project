Yet it is located in its own secluded location surrounded by pine forests. The guest cabin is nicely decorated and has a lot of privacy. The staff is super friendly. Although the lodge is far away from the main road, it has a convenience store where you can buy most of life's necessities. The restaurant/bar is cozy and rustic. I enjoyed every meal we had there. There is a community center, swimming pool, and jacuzzi, I loved the salads and kids' menu even though I am an adult. I was snowed in for a couple of days but I had plenty of hiking along the main roads to highway 120 in one direction and a highway to Hetch Hethcy Lake in the other. Furthermore, the cabin rate is highly reasonable. All in all, a wonderful experience.. I found this place through chatgpt who analyzed all nearby hotels and lodges and then put this place as the number one choice in terms of service and expense. Initially, I thought chatgpt was probably wrong about it given its secluded location but the facts proved he is right and really knows what he is talking about.Show moreLGuest review byLeeCanadaStrawberry InnStrawberryFrom $215.99 per nightScored out of 10, guest rating 5.75.7Fair - What previous guests thought, 86 reviews Fair · 86 reviewsAn amazing and magical place in the foothills of Sierras.
