We debated on whether to stay in New Jersey or New York. We searched for rooms and this motel in Jersey City seemed like a good choice. It was perfect. We walked to a coffee shop in Jersey City and felt quite safe. We passed many solo joggers, mothers with small children and bicyclists. The part of the city we were in was very clean. We were pleasantly surprised.Show moreCGuest review byCornelius10.0I've been going to Wildwood since I was a kid took my kids...I've been going to Wildwood since I was a kid took my kids there every year for a week but this experience with this motel has been very upsetting as they blamed me for booking thru their website with a 3td party they supposedly are not affiliated with .

Finding and paying for parking in NYC was a difficulty I could live without. Fortunately, most tolls were paid with the car rental agreement. The Secaucus location was perfect for driving, but the buses stop right outside the hotel. If it were available to guests, more information on bus routes to the City's main attractions, as well as details on paying for bus and subway toll passes and wheelchair accessibility, would be helpful and might change how a traveler chooses to get around.Show moreRGuest review byReyesUnited States10.0Nice secure area, mind the pavements they may be bumpy (...Nice secure area, mind the pavements they may be bumpy (though getting fixed from time to time), close to NYC, tunnel takes its time but was never extreme, nice small neighborhoods, great view on NYC, nice shopping (mall, low price shops, dine-in)Show moreVGuest review byVividAustria10.0we are seniors and had been to wild wood many times. this...we are seniors and had been to wild wood many times. this was the first time in the crest and we liked it but to be fair we had plans to go to cape may for antiques and food and sunset beach. also we love the the cape may zoo. we did find a restaurant near our Aqua Beach hotel, italian, i think and it was great.Show morerGuest review byrussellUnited States10.0Cape May, NJ is a charming seaside destination that blends...Cape May, NJ is a charming seaside destination that blends Victorian elegance, coastal beauty, and a laid-back atmosphere. Parking can be tricky—consider walking or biking around town. The Washington Street Mall is a pedestrian, friendly shopping district filled with unique boutiques, candy shops, and local eateries. Dining options range from casual seafood shacks to upscale restaurants.Show moreLGuest review byLberry8833United States4.0It was a good location.It was a good location.
Advertised as fully equipped kitchen, but there was nothing in the kitchen area.
We had to ask for a coffee pot and coffee.
Breakfast was very sparse - a granola bar and small muffin.
Room was very dated, I.e., cabinet doors falling off, shower over tub.Show moreAGuest review byAnonymous8.0Seaside Heights is a good place for families.Seaside Heights is a good place for families. The boardwalks and beaches are clean and safe. There is a beach where dogs can go, south of the boardwalk. It's not that far of a drive and we're glad our puppy could go. Recommend getting up early to catch the sunrise.Show moreJGuest review byJenniferResearch, refine and make plans for your whole tripFlights to New JerseyGet your flight tickets to New Jersey right here on Booking.com.Hotels in Yosemite National ParkDiscover another popular destination within the United States.Hotels in Disney World AreaDiscover another popular destination within the United States.Hotels near MetLife StadiumPlaces to stay with a popular tourist attraction nearby.Hotels near Atlantic City BoardwalkPlaces to stay with a popular tourist attraction nearby.Cheap holidays in Atlantic CityBook the best flights, stays and more – all in one placeHotels in ManhattanThinking about a longer trip?
