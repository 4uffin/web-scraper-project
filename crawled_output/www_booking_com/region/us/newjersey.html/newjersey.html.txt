Finding and paying for parking in NYC was a difficulty I could live without. Fortunately, most tolls were paid with the car rental agreement. The Secaucus location was perfect for driving, but the buses stop right outside the hotel. If it were available to guests, more information on bus routes to the City's main attractions, as well as details on paying for bus and subway toll passes and wheelchair accessibility, would be helpful and might change how a traveler chooses to get around.Show moreRGuest review byReyesUnited States10.0we are seniors and had been to wild wood many times. this...we are seniors and had been to wild wood many times. this was the first time in the crest and we liked it but to be fair we had plans to go to cape may for antiques and food and sunset beach. also we love the the cape may zoo. we did find a restaurant near our Aqua Beach hotel, italian, i think and it was great.Show morerGuest review byrussellUnited States10.0Cape May, NJ is a charming seaside destination that blends...Cape May, NJ is a charming seaside destination that blends Victorian elegance, coastal beauty, and a laid-back atmosphere. Parking can be tricky—consider walking or biking around town. The Washington Street Mall is a pedestrian, friendly shopping district filled with unique boutiques, candy shops, and local eateries. Dining options range from casual seafood shacks to upscale restaurants.Show moreLGuest review byLberry8833United States4.0It was a good location.It was a good location.
Advertised as fully equipped kitchen, but there was nothing in the kitchen area.
We had to ask for a coffee pot and coffee.
Breakfast was very sparse - a granola bar and small muffin.
Room was very dated, I.e., cabinet doors falling off, shower over tub.Show moreAGuest review byAnonymous6.0parking should be free its customers.parking should be free its customers. It cost us an extra $100 which we were unaware of the daily price of parking until we got the charge. There was nothing showing how much it will cost us for parking - transparency.
towels / wash clothes seem to be in short supply ever time we asked, so we had to keep going back / forth. Staff was great in their jobs / helpful. Location was great.Show moreBGuest review byBdaonionBermudaResearch, refine, and make plans for your whole tripCheap vacations in Atlantic CityPlan everything you need for your vacation in one place – from flights and stays to tours and activitiesHotels in Atlantic CityA popular choice with guests visiting New Jersey.Hotels in Jersey CityA popular choice with guests visiting New Jersey.Hotels in the United StatesSet off to explore the whole country.When to visit the United StatesEvents, prices, weather, and more.Hotels in ManhattanTake a look at properties in a destination nearby.Hotels in Bergen CountyThinking about a longer trip?
