JJoaoFromAustraliaSuch a comfy homey vibe, the owner Shem is an absolute LEGEND, we arrived late at night after a very long drive from the Grand Canyon in our West US road trip, and he welcomed us with some beers and a great chat around the beautiful wooden counter. Just what we needed after many nights at motels on the go. Next day he made the best eggs and bacon breakfast which got us the energy we needed for the next chapter of our trip.
We didn‚Äôt get the chance to explore the area as we had to make it to Vegas early in the day, but having stayed at this gem was one of the highlights of our trip.
Wishing the best for Shem and his wife! Hopefully see you again one day!

Loved Wild Thyme restaurant.
Had their salmon dish and we shared a delish dessert.
Went to Moqui Cave. Very interesting story of the lineage of the Hopi Cave told by the employees.
It is very touristy but very cool to check out and if you are into rocks, gems, Native American jewelry, it is a must stop.
They have wind caves there but didn‚Äôt have time for that.
A beautiful area.
Reminds me of a mini-Sedona.

It has a good selection of lodging, restaurants, and shops, including outfitters for active pursuits in the park. We can recommend Oscar's and Spotted Dog restaurants for any meal and Porters for breakfast. Zion Outfitters, conveniently located right at the walk-in footbridge into the park, is a great place to rent water boots and hiking sticks for the Narrows hike.Show moreMGuest review byMarkUnited States10.0Hurricane is great because it's near Zion National Park and...Hurricane is great because it's near Zion National Park and everything you can do there. We found a few great restaurants - River Rock Roasting Company's cinnamon rolls are not to be missed. We also loved Main Street Cafe. There's everything you need - grocery stores, Walmart, gas stations, and restaurants.
While staying in Hurricane, we embarked on a Canyoning tour with Red Desert Adventure. It was phenomenal! If rappelling down waterfalls, climbing Via Ferratta, and zip lining across canyons sounds like your happy place, then I highly recommend it!
We also hiked the Narrows. We picked up our gear the night before our adventure from Zion Guru, which has a parking lot.Show moreDGuest review byDavidUnited States10.0It was the perfect place for my visit to Zion.It was the perfect place for my visit to Zion. A 20 minute drive from the park, quiet and restful after a very busy day of hiking!
I would definitely recommend it to anyone. Try out River Rock cafe when you‚Äôre there.Show moreAGuest review byAnonymous8.0A very nice and comfortable hotel.A very nice and comfortable hotel. The room was cozy and had everything we needed (we even managed to iron a shirt before going out for dinner). The pool is large and pleasant, and breakfast was plentiful with a good variety of options. We enjoyed it as a great base for our hikes in Zion National Park. The one thing I would change is the large parking area inside the property, which many rooms face. I would have preferred it to be located a bit farther away to better preserve the beauty and wilderness of the surrounding landscape.Show moreCGuest review byChiaraItaly10.0Hildale is a beautiful little town.Hildale is a beautiful little town.
The border Store on the edge of the state border with Arizona is a great little gem - the people are so friendly and the store is well equipped.

There are plenty of stores and restaurants.
Most of the restaurants are chains but there are a few local standouts.
It is close to many national parks and lots of state parks and trails.
Very safe and fun place to get outside.Show moreAGuest review byAmyUnited States10.0Everything was great. They called me the day before toEverything was great. They called me the day before to

The cottages are so cute and private. The staff is kind and accommodating. Very good breakfast in the morning. Definitely we will go back there.Show moreDGuest review byDaniela10.0We were initially worried Rockville was too far away from...We were initially worried Rockville was too far away from Zion entrance, however it was not a problem at all. Rockville is a 5min drive to the Springdale's restaurants and facilties, as well as the entrance to Zion... not that we needed the restaurants. The BB had a lovely kitchen and dining area opening into the garden. We ended up sharing our dinner with 2 different families over the 3 day stay. Got to meet some lovely people and it added some beautiful memories to our trip. Strongly recommend RockvilleShow moreTGuest review byTorAustraliaResearch, refine, and make plans for your whole tripHotels near Zion National ParkFind hotels close to Zion National Park, a popular tourist attraction for visitors heading to the same area of the United States.Hotels in the United StatesSet off to explore the whole country.Hotels in Yosemite National ParkDiscover another popular destination in the United States.Hotels in Disney World AreaDiscover another popular destination in the United States.Flights to Zion National Park Getting to Zion National Park
