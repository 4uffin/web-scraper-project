KKathleen JoyceFromPhilippinesLiked everything in this hotel! Staff are pleasant and always smiling, our room is super clean, and the swimming pool is super clean as well that the water is so clear! Location is near the waikiki beach and the Royal Hawaiian Center. Also liked that across the hotel is a public access to the beach which is not very crowded. We appreciated that they allow access to the washroom and on the eight floor even after we checked out while we are waiting for our flight.

We also did the luxe picnic and that food was fantastic as well. The hotel really goes out of their way to provide a quiet, romantic, and unique experience. The suites are large, well furnished, and comfortable. There is even a small kitchen with nespresso, a toaster, microwave, plates and utensils, refrigerator, freezer, cups. No, it‚Äôs not on the beach‚Ä¶ however, if you want to go, let them know which beach and they‚Äôll provide you chairs and an umbrella and they‚Äôll drop you off and come pick you up.

Get inspired by reviews of cities in Hawaii8.0We only spent one night in Waikiki area, but it was...We only spent one night in Waikiki area, but it was considerably busier than the many other places we've been around the islands. Reminded me of Shibuya or Osaka (also in part due to affluence of Japanese tourists). We didn't visit many amenities but the beach at Waikiki was quite packed, even though we went there around 8 AM on a Monday in September (three lines of parties at all times). No major complain but not exactly the impression/expectation of the islands.Show moreMGuest review byMiguelSpain8.0The area is beautiful; however, the tragedy of the loss of...The area is beautiful; however, the tragedy of the loss of the Old Town Lahaina casts a pall over the area.
If you have memories of before the fire, it is very, very sad to see the remains of buildings and know that over 100 people lost their lives.
The sentiment of Lahaina Strong is wonderful and uplifting but as you speak with residents, the current, somber message is that we will never regain what has been lost and there is no definitive plan or timeline for rebuilding.
You are asked to not take photos and to respect the area.
There is a bypass road that has been built.Show moreGGuest review byGeorgeUnited States6.0As a Big Island resident, I think Kona is over rated and...As a Big Island resident, I think Kona is over rated and overpriced for what it is. I think it looks like a strip mine with some beaches. Ali'i drive shops has many vacancies.
I think other parts of the island have more to offer in beauty, scenery and temperature which is why I don't live in Kona.Show moreLGuest review byLupien8.0Kapaa seems to be an old town.Kapaa seems to be an old town.
It is not like Poipu or Hanalei but good small town.
We had great meal at Fish Bar Deli, local foods
(spam musubi and chicken karate) to take out
at Wailua Drive In, and big bowl of pho at Pho Kapaa.
These places were busy with local people and we enjoyed their meals as well as services.Show moreRGuest review byRyokoUnited States10.0I LOVE Hilo!!! It still holds "The Essence of Hawaii."I LOVE Hilo!!! It still holds "The Essence of Hawaii." It is not overrun with tall modern buildings, and "Tacky Tourist Attractions."
It maintains an Old Hawaii Charm. You're not overwhelmed with street performers and aggressive sales people trying to pull you into their cosmetics stores. Yet there are still some homeless people there which is not good. However, I feel very safe in Hilo. There are nearby beautiful gardens and great beaches! Hilo is surrounded by so much natural beauty. There are some great restaurants there as well. I really like all of them, and I make sure to have at least one dinner at Hilo Bay Cafe. I also always make sure to visit the Imiloa Astronomy Center by UH Hilo. It is an excellent place to learn about the history & culture of Hawaii. And their planetarium has amazing presentations!Show moreGGuest review byGayleUnited States10.0This property is right in between the Marriott and the grand...This property is right in between the Marriott and the grand Wailea with beach front access.

Can go south from Kihei and go snorkeling at several places.
Take a trip out to Molokini, go to the top of Volcano and even did the road to Hana.
Lots of food choices near and in Kihei and groceries too.
Great location, will stay in that area again,Show moreHGuest review byHagerUnited States10.0The view from the property was OK.The view from the property was OK. There was a cruise ship docked across the way and several garage type businesses across the street. No real ocean view.

Hanalei is a village about 15 minutes, with some nice restaurant and boutiques. Bigger town, Kappa is 35 minutes.
However, Princeville has a grocery store with all your needs.
I really enjoyed Princeville and will stay again there.
Kauai is a low-key beautiful island with Waimea Canyon n much more to offer.Show moreaGuest review byarceliaUnited States8.0We loved the location and how close we were to the beach!We loved the location and how close we were to the beach! Lots of walking paths. Very quiet around the area, but the people above us were stomping across the floor at all hours of the night and early morning. The pool needs some bug control as we had flies on us non-stop and bites on us from the bugs. The host was very accommodating and gave us extra toiletries and even provided box fans which was really nice! The king bed was very comfortable. We would stay here again.Show moreRGuest review byROBINUnited StatesResearch, refine, and make plans for your whole tripHotels near Honolulu AirportFind hotels conveniently close to the area's most popular airport ‚Äì perfect for a late arrival or early departure.Hotels near Kona International AirportPerfect for a late arrival or early departure.Hotels in HonoluluA popular choice with guests visiting Hawaii.Hotels in Kailua-KonaA popular choice with guests visiting Hawaii.Hotels on MauiTake a look at properties in a destination nearby.Hotels on OahuTake a look at properties in a destination nearby.Hotels in the United StatesIf you're planning a longer trip, look beyond Hawaii and explore the whole country!Resorts in HawaiiExplore more great accommodation options for your trip.Cheap hotels in HawaiiExplore more great accommodation options for your trip.Show moreCountriesRegionsCitiesDistrictsAirportsHotelsPlaces of interestVacation HomesApartmentsResortsVillasHostelsB&BsGuest HousesUnique places to stayAll destinationsAll flight destinationsAll car rental locationsAll vacation destinationsGuidesDiscoverReviewsDiscover monthly staysSupportCoronavirus (COVID-19) FAQsManage your tripsContact Customer ServiceSafety Resource CenterDiscoverGenius loyalty programSeasonal and holiday dealsTravel articlesBooking.com for BusinessTraveller Review AwardsCar rentalFlight finderRestaurant reservationsBooking.com for Travel AgentsTerms and settingsPrivacy & cookiesTerms of ServiceAccessibility StatementDispute resolutionModern Slavery StatementHuman Rights StatementPartnersExtranet loginPartner helpList your propertyBecome an affiliateAboutAbout Booking.comHow We WorkSustainabilityPress centerCareersInvestor relationsCorporate contactUSDBooking.com is part of Booking Holdings Inc., the world leader in online travel and related services.
