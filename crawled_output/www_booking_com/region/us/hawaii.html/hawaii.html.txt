If you have memories of before the fire, it is very, very sad to see the remains of buildings and know that over 100 people lost their lives.
The sentiment of Lahaina Strong is wonderful and uplifting but as you speak with residents, the current, somber message is that we will never regain what has been lost and there is no definitive plan or timeline for rebuilding.
You are asked to not take photos and to respect the area.
There is a bypass road that has been built.Show moreGGuest review byGeorgeUnited States6.0As a Big Island resident, I think Kona is over rated and...As a Big Island resident, I think Kona is over rated and overpriced for what it is. I think it looks like a strip mine with some beaches. Ali'i drive shops has many vacancies.
I think other parts of the island have more to offer in beauty, scenery and temperature which is why I don't live in Kona.Show moreLGuest review byLupien8.0Kapaa seems to be an old town.Kapaa seems to be an old town.
It is not like Poipu or Hanalei but good small town.
We had great meal at Fish Bar Deli, local foods
(spam musubi and chicken karate) to take out
at Wailua Drive In, and big bowl of pho at Pho Kapaa.
These places were busy with local people and we enjoyed their meals as well as services.Show moreRGuest review byRyokoUnited States10.0I LOVE Hilo!!! It still holds "The Essence of Hawaii."I LOVE Hilo!!! It still holds "The Essence of Hawaii." It is not overrun with tall modern buildings, and "Tacky Tourist Attractions."
It maintains an Old Hawaii Charm. You're not overwhelmed with street performers and aggressive sales people trying to pull you into their cosmetics stores. Yet there are still some homeless people there which is not good. However, I feel very safe in Hilo. There are nearby beautiful gardens and great beaches! Hilo is surrounded by so much natural beauty. There are some great restaurants there as well. I really like all of them, and I make sure to have at least one dinner at Hilo Bay Cafe. I also always make sure to visit the Imiloa Astronomy Center by UH Hilo. It is an excellent place to learn about the history & culture of Hawaii. And their planetarium has amazing presentations!Show moreGGuest review byGayleUnited States10.0This property is right in between the Marriott and the grand...This property is right in between the Marriott and the grand Wailea with beach front access. This property has beach service where they have towels and lounge chairs for the property.The property is absolutely beautiful. I found the pools to be a little too shallow for swimming. This property is located right next to a lot of restaurants and shopping. We would definitely come back.Show moreAGuest review byAShleyUnited States10.0So MANY things to do on southwest part of Maui.So MANY things to do on southwest part of Maui. Can go south from Kihei and go snorkeling at several places.
Take a trip out to Molokini, go to the top of Volcano and even did the road to Hana.
Lots of food choices near and in Kihei and groceries too.
Great location, will stay in that area again,Show moreHGuest review byHagerUnited States10.0The view from the property was OK.The view from the property was OK. There was a cruise ship docked across the way and several garage type businesses across the street. No real ocean view.
The plants are beautiful and it's fun to see the chickens and roosters running around every where you go.Show moreJGuest review byJanet10.0Princeville is a quiet residential neighborhood.Princeville is a quiet residential neighborhood. Hanalei is a village about 15 minutes, with some nice restaurant and boutiques. Bigger town, Kappa is 35 minutes.
However, Princeville has a grocery store with all your needs.
I really enjoyed Princeville and will stay again there.
Kauai is a low-key beautiful island with Waimea Canyon n much more to offer.Show moreaGuest review byarceliaUnited States8.0We loved the location and how close we were to the beach!We loved the location and how close we were to the beach! Lots of walking paths. Very quiet around the area, but the people above us were stomping across the floor at all hours of the night and early morning. The pool needs some bug control as we had flies on us non-stop and bites on us from the bugs. The host was very accommodating and gave us extra toiletries and even provided box fans which was really nice! The king bed was very comfortable. We would stay here again.Show moreRGuest review byROBINUnited StatesResearch, refine, and make plans for your whole tripHotels in Yosemite National ParkHit the road and make the most of your trip by discovering another popular destination in the United States.Hotels in Disney World AreaDiscover another popular destination in the United States.Hotels on MauiTake a look at properties in a destination nearby.Hotels on OahuTake a look at properties in a destination nearby.Hotels in the United StatesSet off to explore the whole country.Car rental near Honolulu AirportPick up your rental car as soon as you land.Hotels in HonoluluThinking about which towns and cities to visit during your trip to Hawaii?
