TTanjaFromAustriaComing from Europe we fell in love with Napili beach during our honeymoon many years ago. The Mauian Hotel was the affordable solution for us with kids. We also didn't want one of those huge, anonymous places to stay and were not disappointed. The Mauian is one of the most beautiful resorts we have been to: lots of huge palm and plumeria trees. The vegetation shows that it is not a new resort but one that has been there for many many years.
The pool in the middle of the resort is not the newest or biggest but everybody meets there for barbecueing and sozialising. The beach is just perfect! Many guests revisit and know each other - very familiar and family orientated (which also means quite a lot of rules like e.g. pool hours annd quiet time)

The USA’s 50th and most exotic state comprises over 19 volcanic islands with diverse landscapes, amazing beaches and rainforest greenery. It’s an exclusive destination, so of all Hawaii hotels, 5 star properties make up a decent proportion.Home to Pearl Harbour, the capital Honolulu on O’ahu island has many hotels by Waikiki beach, immortalised in song and famous for excellent nightlife and surfing, as anyone familiar with Hawaii-5-0 will know. Northern O’ahu has some of the best winter surfing around.The nearest island is laidback Molokai and to its south is unspoilt Lanai. East is the island home to most Hawaii hotels – Maui. Hiking to the green peaks of its rugged interior gives a completely different viewpoint. Of course, the beaches are still the main attraction and there is a long line of hotels on the beach on Booking.com, from green Lahaina all the way to beautiful Kapalua. Other fantastic beaches are found at Kihei and neighbouring Wailea.South-west is Hawai’I (Big Island), dominated by Mauna Loa – one of the world’s largest volcanoes. In its foothills are the joint resorts of Kailua and Kona, while the northern Kohala coast provides spectacular scenery. In the east Hilo curves around a bay and is home to the island’s airport.Planning a trip? Get inspired by reviews of cities in Hawaii8.0We only spent one night in Waikiki area, but it was...We only spent one night in Waikiki area, but it was considerably busier than the many other places we've been around the islands. Reminded me of Shibuya or Osaka (also in part due to affluence of Japanese tourists). We didn't visit many amenities but the beach at Waikiki was quite packed, even though we went there around 8 AM on a Monday in September (three lines of parties at all times). No major complain but not exactly the impression/expectation of the islands.Show moreMGuest review byMiguelSpain8.0The area is beautiful; however, the tragedy of the loss of...The area is beautiful; however, the tragedy of the loss of the Old Town Lahaina casts a pall over the area.
If you have memories of before the fire, it is very, very sad to see the remains of buildings and know that over 100 people lost their lives.
The sentiment of Lahaina Strong is wonderful and uplifting but as you speak with residents, the current, somber message is that we will never regain what has been lost and there is no definitive plan or timeline for rebuilding.
You are asked to not take photos and to respect the area.
There is a bypass road that has been built.Show moreGGuest review byGeorgeUnited States6.0As a Big Island resident, I think Kona is over rated and...As a Big Island resident, I think Kona is over rated and overpriced for what it is.

It still holds "The Essence of Hawaii."I LOVE Hilo!!! It still holds "The Essence of Hawaii." It is not overrun with tall modern buildings, and "Tacky Tourist Attractions."
It maintains an Old Hawaii Charm. You're not overwhelmed with street performers and aggressive sales people trying to pull you into their cosmetics stores. Yet there are still some homeless people there which is not good. However, I feel very safe in Hilo. There are nearby beautiful gardens and great beaches! Hilo is surrounded by so much natural beauty. There are some great restaurants there as well. I really like all of them, and I make sure to have at least one dinner at Hilo Bay Cafe. I also always make sure to visit the Imiloa Astronomy Center by UH Hilo. It is an excellent place to learn about the history & culture of Hawaii.

Lots of walking paths. Very quiet around the area, but the people above us were stomping across the floor at all hours of the night and early morning. The pool needs some bug control as we had flies on us non-stop and bites on us from the bugs. The host was very accommodating and gave us extra toiletries and even provided box fans which was really nice! The king bed was very comfortable.
