Perfect location to see all of Long Island East End.

For those that don't know New York.........visit the HAMPTONS and Riverhead is a perfect location as your hub.
Canoe trips along the river are a fun day sport if you're up to "portages".

Altogether, a convenient and pleasant place to stay with efficient train access to Manhattan.Show moreDGuest review byDanielCanada2.0The staff was lovely but the accommodations were weak at...The staff was lovely but the accommodations were weak at best!
The bed was way too small.
I booked a king size bed....I thought! The room was small, dark and noisy and had a weird chemical smell as if to hide a foul odor.
And....no itemized bill upon check-out!
Cost over $300.00 for a room that wasn't worth it.
Worst breakfast than any Hampton Inn I have ever stayed at.
Good coffee but no stirrers and only little Coffee Mate containers instead of milk or half and half.Show moreMGuest review byMcKenzieUnited States8.0VIEW ABSOLUTELY FANTABULOUS ...

The hotel should be considered a "classic". It is not too modern nor too old style. Staff is very professional and helpful. The restaurant offers a good choice of amazing dishes.
Garden city is accessible by waling and has many bars and restaurants, banks, shops etc.Show moreDGuest review byDavidBelgium2.0This Hilton is a disgrace to the Hilton name brand.This Hilton is a disgrace to the Hilton name brand. Staff not friendly or helpful. Room was very dirty. Lamps didn't work, corridor to room had wires exposed the whole time of our 5 day stay. Fire alarm went off 3 times, twice in the middle of the night. I DO NOT recommend this hotel.Show moreJGuest review byJeanResearch, refine, and make plans for your whole tripWhen to visit the United StatesEvents, prices, weather – everything you need to know about the best time to visit the United States.Hotels in the United StatesSet off to explore the whole country.Hotels in MontaukA popular choice with guests visiting Long Island.Hotels in RiverheadA popular choice with guests visiting Long Island.Hotels in New York StateTake a look at properties in a destination nearby.Hotels in The HamptonsTake a look at properties in a destination nearby.Hotels in Yosemite National ParkHit the road and make the most of your trip by discovering another popular destination in the United States.Hotels in Disney World AreaDiscover another popular destination in the United States.Hotels near The ParamountPlaces to stay with a popular tourist attraction nearby.Show moreCountriesRegionsCitiesDistrictsAirportsHotelsPlaces of interestVacation HomesApartmentsResortsVillasHostelsB&BsGuest HousesUnique places to stayAll destinationsAll flight destinationsAll car rental locationsAll vacation destinationsGuidesDiscoverReviewsDiscover monthly staysSupportCoronavirus (COVID-19) FAQsManage your tripsContact Customer ServiceSafety Resource CenterDiscoverGenius loyalty programSeasonal and holiday dealsTravel articlesBooking.com for BusinessTraveller Review AwardsCar rentalFlight finderRestaurant reservationsBooking.com for Travel AgentsTerms and settingsPrivacy & cookiesTerms of ServiceAccessibility StatementDispute resolutionModern Slavery StatementHuman Rights StatementPartnersExtranet loginPartner helpList your propertyBecome an affiliateAboutAbout Booking.comHow We WorkSustainabilityPress centerCareersInvestor relationsCorporate contactContent guidelines and reportingUSDBooking.com is part of Booking Holdings Inc., the world leader in online travel and related services.
