Perfect location to see all of Long Island East End.

Altogether, a convenient and pleasant place to stay with efficient train access to Manhattan.Show moreDGuest review byDanielCanada8.0Location of hotel is very good. Room size is good.Location of hotel is very good. Room size is good. Room service too. Shortage of lights in the room. Beds are very comfortable. Pillows are also very nice. Double bed width is not enough for 2 persons.
Carpet of all the places became very old and giving bad smell.
Corridor side wallpaper are in a bad position. It's tearing off.
Swimming pool area needs renovation to make beautiful.
Lobby entrance from out side needs renovation.Show moreAGuest review byAnonymous8.0VIEW ABSOLUTELY FANTABULOUS ... BIKE RENTAL SO GREAT ...VIEW ABSOLUTELY FANTABULOUS ... BIKE RENTAL SO GREAT ...

The bed was way too small.
I booked a king size bed....I thought! The room was small, dark and noisy and had a weird chemical smell as if to hide a foul odor.
And....no itemized bill upon check-out!
Cost over $300.00 for a room that wasn't worth it.
Worst breakfast than any Hampton Inn I have ever stayed at.
Good coffee but no stirrers and only little Coffee Mate containers instead of milk or half and half.Show moreMGuest review byMcKenzieUnited States10.0I often stay in garden City for a lot of practical reasons:...I often stay in garden City for a lot of practical reasons: convenient access from the airports, access to my meetings. The hotel should be considered a "classic". It is not too modern nor too old style. Staff is very professional and helpful. The restaurant offers a good choice of amazing dishes.
Garden city is accessible by waling and has many bars and restaurants, banks, shops etc.Show moreDGuest review byDavidBelgium4.0When I comped rooms in the area this wasn't the best room I...When I comped rooms in the area this wasn't the best room I could get for my money.. but the cancellation policy was.

We drove down to the maritime museum and to the splish splash water park. Each about 20 minutes from our place. It seemed that once we got on a main hwy we were 15-20 minutes away from anything.
This is not a place to go if you want to spend time on a beach out by the "Hamptons" . I say this because all the beaches out that way seem to be available only to people with passes/ residents and their guests. So that bit of planning was not good on our part.
We could have planned to go back toward the city and the beaches there but we enjoyed our couple of days in Ronkonkoma. Went to the local Carvel twice.(wednesday was BOGO). We did not spend time at the lake there, maybe if we had planned more time to just relax we would have gone over to it to stay. We just drove around the lake and the 3 towns surrounding it.
Airport was around the corner and that was
an extreme plus.Show moreTGuest review byTravelingWithParkUnited StatesResearch, refine, and make plans for your whole tripHotels near The ParamountFind hotels close to The Paramount, a popular tourist attraction for visitors heading to the same area of the United States.Hotels near Hofstra UniversityPlaces to stay with a popular tourist attraction nearby.Flights to Long IslandGetting to Long Island just got easier!Hotels in the United StatesSet off to explore the whole country.When to visit the United StatesEvents, prices, weather, and more.Hotels in New York StateTake a look at properties in a destination nearby.Hotels in The HamptonsThinking about a longer trip?
