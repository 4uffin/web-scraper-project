For those that don't know New York.........visit the HAMPTONS and Riverhead is a perfect location as your hub.
Canoe trips along the river are a fun day sport if you're up to "portages".

The bed was way too small.
I booked a king size bed....I thought! The room was small, dark and noisy and had a weird chemical smell as if to hide a foul odor.
And....no itemized bill upon check-out!
Cost over $300.00 for a room that wasn't worth it.
Worst breakfast than any Hampton Inn I have ever stayed at.
Good coffee but no stirrers and only little Coffee Mate containers instead of milk or half and half.Show moreMGuest review byMcKenzieUnited States2.0my room was given away and was stuck in pet friendly room...my room was given away and was stuck in pet friendly room had no choice due to room aready paid for.

The hotel should be considered a "classic". It is not too modern nor too old style. Staff is very professional and helpful. The restaurant offers a good choice of amazing dishes.
Garden city is accessible by waling and has many bars and restaurants, banks, shops etc.Show moreDGuest review byDavidBelgium8.0Rockville Centre had a very nice restaurant, The Pantry,...Rockville Centre had a very nice restaurant, The Pantry, where we had an excellent dinner on Christmas Day, and our hotel, Best Western Mill River Manor, provided quick and easy access (a 2-minute walk from the hotel) to the Rockville Centre Long Island Railroad (LIRR) station where we were able to choose any one of numerous trains to Manhattan via Central Station or Penn Station. Altogether, a convenient and pleasant place to stay with efficient train access to Manhattan.Show moreDGuest review byDanielCanada2.0This Hilton is a disgrace to the Hilton name brand.This Hilton is a disgrace to the Hilton name brand. Staff not friendly or helpful. Room was very dirty. Lamps didn't work, corridor to room had wires exposed the whole time of our 5 day stay. Fire alarm went off 3 times, twice in the middle of the night. I DO NOT recommend this hotel.Show moreJGuest review byJeanResearch, refine, and make plans for your whole tripHotels in MontaukThinking about which towns and cities to visit during your trip to Long Island?
