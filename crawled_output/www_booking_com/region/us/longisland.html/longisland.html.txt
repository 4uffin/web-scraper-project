The bed was way too small.
I booked a king size bed....I thought! The room was small, dark and noisy and had a weird chemical smell as if to hide a foul odor.
And....no itemized bill upon check-out!
Cost over $300.00 for a room that wasn't worth it.
Worst breakfast than any Hampton Inn I have ever stayed at.
Good coffee but no stirrers and only little Coffee Mate containers instead of milk or half and half.Show moreMGuest review byMcKenzieUnited States8.0VIEW ABSOLUTELY FANTABULOUS ...

Altogether, a convenient and pleasant place to stay with efficient train access to Manhattan.Show moreDGuest review byDanielCanada2.0This Hilton is a disgrace to the Hilton name brand.This Hilton is a disgrace to the Hilton name brand. Staff not friendly or helpful. Room was very dirty. Lamps didn't work, corridor to room had wires exposed the whole time of our 5 day stay. Fire alarm went off 3 times, twice in the middle of the night. I DO NOT recommend this hotel.Show moreJGuest review byJean10.0I often stay in garden City for a lot of practical reasons:...I often stay in garden City for a lot of practical reasons: convenient access from the airports, access to my meetings. The hotel should be considered a "classic". It is not too modern nor too old style. Staff is very professional and helpful. The restaurant offers a good choice of amazing dishes.
Garden city is accessible by waling and has many bars and restaurants, banks, shops etc.Show moreDGuest review byDavidBelgium4.0When I comped rooms in the area this wasn't the best room I...When I comped rooms in the area this wasn't the best room I could get for my money.. but the cancellation policy was.
