The staff were untrained and lacking experience, appearing overly casual. They seemed to be more like students than professionals. They advertised a "valet parking" service, but even if the attendant by the hotel entrance was charming, this "service" was nothing short of a joke. There was a lack of information and a general sense of indifference.
The reception had an amateurish feel, with an 18-year-old girl visibly struggling to operate the computer.
Regardless, this place is an absolute dream..Show moreRGuest review byRomainFranceBeachcomber Resort at MontaukMontaukFrom £262.01 per nightScored out of 10, guest rating 9.19.1Superb - What previous guests thought, 168 reviews Superb · 168 reviewsLiz and her staff are beyond exceptional.

Get inspired by reviews of cities in Long Island8.0I loved being at the lighthouse and being at the ocean.I loved being at the lighthouse and being at the ocean.
I had not been out that way since I was about 10. And that was a very, very long time ago.
The town of montauk was fun to explore and walks on the beach were always pleasant.
I also got to see some minke whales just through my binoculars!
Food was quite good.
Quancho’s had amazing fish tacos.
The Bambi cafe had a lovely light avocado toast with vegan feta which had wonderful flavor.
The Left Hand made great coffee.
Their flat white was one of the best.Show moreEGuest review byEileen10.0The Hamptons, North and South Shores of Long Island are...The Hamptons, North and South Shores of Long Island are beautiful.
It was great to be back home.
Riverhead has become a very lovely town; visit all the local wineries and restaurants and beach.
Perfect location to see all of Long Island East End.
Local farmstands are wonderful.
For those that don't know New York.........visit the HAMPTONS and Riverhead is a perfect location as your hub.
Canoe trips along the river are a fun day sport if you're up to "portages".
Drive down Dune Road and awe the mansions.
Visit the DUCK!Show moreRGuest review byRalphUnited States8.0Location of hotel is very good. Room size is good.Location of hotel is very good. Room size is good. Room service too. Shortage of lights in the room. Beds are very comfortable. Pillows are also very nice. Double bed width is not enough for 2 persons.
Carpet of all the places became very old and giving bad smell.
Corridor side wallpaper are in a bad position. It's tearing off.
Swimming pool area needs renovation to make beautiful.
Lobby entrance from out side needs renovation.Show moreAGuest review byAnonymous2.0The staff was lovely but the accommodations were weak at...The staff was lovely but the accommodations were weak at best!
The bed was way too small.
I booked a king size bed....I thought! The room was small, dark and noisy and had a weird chemical smell as if to hide a foul odor.
And....no itemized bill upon check-out!
Cost over $300.00 for a room that wasn't worth it.
Worst breakfast than any Hampton Inn I have ever stayed at.
Good coffee but no stirrers and only little Coffee Mate containers instead of milk or half and half.Show moreMGuest review byMcKenzieUnited States2.0my room was given away and was stuck in pet friendly room...my room was given away and was stuck in pet friendly room had no choice due to room aready paid for.

Altogether, a convenient and pleasant place to stay with efficient train access to Manhattan.Show moreDGuest review byDanielCanada10.0I often stay in garden City for a lot of practical reasons:...I often stay in garden City for a lot of practical reasons: convenient access from the airports, access to my meetings. The hotel should be considered a "classic". It is not too modern nor too old style. Staff is very professional and helpful. The restaurant offers a good choice of amazing dishes.
Garden city is accessible by waling and has many bars and restaurants, banks, shops etc.Show moreDGuest review byDavidBelgium2.0This Hilton is a disgrace to the Hilton name brand.This Hilton is a disgrace to the Hilton name brand.
