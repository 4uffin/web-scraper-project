She told us everything we needed to know about the island and the easiest ways to get around etc. We were upgraded to a suite with a private pool and it was SO GOOD. I was concerned to begin with as there aren’t many sunbeds around the main pool for the amount of people in the hotel but when we had our own it was perfect!! There was also another very helpful lady who told us it would be 60€ to the port but when she rung she managed to get it down to 40€ which was another nice touch (rather than just telling us that’s what the price was). We loved it so much we enquired about staying another night but with already having another hotel in Ios booked and paid for, it just wasn’t worth the extra cost :( some of my friends have already booked to stay at the end of August on my recommendation!Show moreMGuest review byMollyUnited KingdomHoneymoon Petra VillasImerovigliScored out of 10, guest rating 9.69.6Exceptional - What previous guests thought, 403 reviews Exceptional · 403 reviewsThe location and property is the best on Santorini!

It can be expensive so plan a little extra money for food though! There are plenty of things to do an see in the town and the public transport to other areas of the island are quite frequent and cheap. There are lots of steep inclines and stairs so keep that in mind, you'll be doing a lot of walking up hillsShow moreLGuest review byLawson6.0Oia is stunning, especially at sunset, but in September it...Oia is stunning, especially at sunset, but in September it felt overrun with cruise ship crowds and influencers.
We loved our simple apartment with its incredible views, starry nights, and the local cats and donkeys. Food and wine are excellent but expensive, and swimming isn’t easy without hiring a car or scooter.
Beautiful to see once, but not ideal if you’re on a budget or want a relaxed swim-and-rest holiday.Show moregGuest review bygowc28United Kingdom10.0Lots of lovely tavernas and bars.Lots of lovely tavernas and bars.
The locals are really friendly.
Take beach shoes as the pebbles can be painful under foot.
Be careful to find out where the rocks in the sea are slippery.
The beach closer towards the rock (The Hook Bar end) has a safer entrance to the sea.
Dimitris Greek night is great fun, there is an open air cinema close by, too!
Great reviews.
There are too many places to recommend for food, drink, sports, music, karaoke.
I don't think there are any places I wouldn't recommend.Show moreDGuest review byDeborahUnited Kingdom10.0On arrival it is confusing - hotel is built on upper slopes...On arrival it is confusing - hotel is built on upper slopes of caldera, so it has different levels. On the plus side as soon as you leave the hotel you are on the famous Fira/Oia walk - turn right for Fira. You are on the highest part of the caldera so initially it is downhill, also you are close to Skaros rock which is worth visiting for the views and has a church partially hidden on the seaward side at a slightly lower elevation.
As long as you can look to the sea you will have great sunset views wherever you are,my hotel patio was great for this.Show moreAGuest review byAlanUnited Kingdom10.0Having stayed two weeks in Perissa, I dare say I know it a...Having stayed two weeks in Perissa, I dare say I know it a bit. It's a great mix of not too big of a town, plenty of groceries shopping spots, Restaurants with some great offers, nice beaches (even though one has to get used to black sand) and cultural spots like a very nice Orthodox Church and some historic ruins if you dare to hike a bit. It's wasn't too crowded either, so if you consider going, do so Early - Mid September.Show moreSGuest review bySherman SiegeLuxembourg8.0A village with bakery, gyros place, souvenir shop & good...A village with bakery, gyros place, souvenir shop & good sized mini market.

Restaurants were excellent and staff in them very polite and attentive.
Greece is not cheap these days so you have to pay the same as in UK for meals etc.
Wine is very expensive but nice to see that they only sell Greek wine in supermarkets and restaurants.Show moreEGuest review byElaineUnited Kingdom10.0The small village streets were rustic and lined with...The small village streets were rustic and lined with friendly shop keepers. A relaxed and friendly inviting people. Hill top views are simply amazing and make fantastic photos. The only issue is when the cruise ships arrive. Streets become over run by time poor travellers, checking their watches and posing for pictures along the narrow pathways leading from the town back to our appartments. Once they have gone, the night becomes peaceful and relaxed again.Show moreRGuest review byRoberto8.0Small village with some very nice restaurants.Small village with some very nice restaurants. The people were friendly and we booked a car at local rental shop. They were cheap, professional and very helpful. They even came to our villa to pick up the car.
Only 9 minutes from airport but you could not hear any planes.
Villa on a hillside and if you suffer from any heart condition it is tough going walking from villa into village.
Swimming Pool not heated we were unable to use it as it was so cold. My fault I did not enquire about heated pool before I booked.
No local information material provided about taxi, restaurants etc so do your research before going. However, you can contact the owners via what’s app and the answer very quickly.
Good wi-fi, very clean villa with friendly housekeeper. Excellent breakfasts.Show moreKGuest review byKeiranUnited Kingdom2.0the location is not what it seams, it is just between the...the location is not what it seams, it is just between the main road and other construction sites or empty fields, with no nice view.
