It can be expensive so plan a little extra money for food though! There are plenty of things to do an see in the town and the public transport to other areas of the island are quite frequent and cheap. There are lots of steep inclines and stairs so keep that in mind, you'll be doing a lot of walking up hillsShow moreLGuest review byLawson6.0Oia is stunning, especially at sunset, but in September it...Oia is stunning, especially at sunset, but in September it felt overrun with cruise ship crowds and influencers.
We loved our simple apartment with its incredible views, starry nights, and the local cats and donkeys. Food and wine are excellent but expensive, and swimming isn’t easy without hiring a car or scooter.
Beautiful to see once, but not ideal if you’re on a budget or want a relaxed swim-and-rest holiday.Show moregGuest review bygowc28United Kingdom10.0Lots of lovely tavernas and bars.Lots of lovely tavernas and bars.
The locals are really friendly.
Take beach shoes as the pebbles can be painful under foot.
Be careful to find out where the rocks in the sea are slippery.
The beach closer towards the rock (The Hook Bar end) has a safer entrance to the sea.
Dimitris Greek night is great fun, there is an open air cinema close by, too!
Great reviews.
There are too many places to recommend for food, drink, sports, music, karaoke.
I don't think there are any places I wouldn't recommend.Show moreDGuest review byDeborahUnited Kingdom10.0Glad I booked Imerovigli over Oia or Fira.Glad I booked Imerovigli over Oia or Fira.
It was quieter, more affordable, has amazing views and walking distance to great restaurants.
We ate at the White Lounge and La Moustache which were both fantastic.
Also easily accessible from the road without too many steps.
Highly recommend!Show moreNGuest review byNickyBAustralia10.0Having stayed two weeks in Perissa, I dare say I know it a...Having stayed two weeks in Perissa, I dare say I know it a bit. It's a great mix of not too big of a town, plenty of groceries shopping spots, Restaurants with some great offers, nice beaches (even though one has to get used to black sand) and cultural spots like a very nice Orthodox Church and some historic ruins if you dare to hike a bit. It's wasn't too crowded either, so if you consider going, do so Early - Mid September.Show moreSGuest review bySherman SiegeLuxembourg8.0A village with bakery, gyros place, souvenir shop & good...A village with bakery, gyros place, souvenir shop & good sized mini market. Walkable to Fura though a noisy main road. Buses good too but more value for money the further you are going. Taxis quite expensive so we walked a lot.Show moreJGuest review byJulieUnited Kingdom10.0Lovely village but getting very busy.Lovely village but getting very busy.
Restaurants were excellent and staff in them very polite and attentive.
Greece is not cheap these days so you have to pay the same as in UK for meals etc.
Wine is very expensive but nice to see that they only sell Greek wine in supermarkets and restaurants.Show moreEGuest review byElaineUnited Kingdom10.0If you visit Santorini, don’t miss this village: authentic,...If you visit Santorini, don’t miss this village: authentic, charming, and far less crowded than other areas. It’s home to some of the island’s best restaurants and still keeps the true Greek atmosphere.

Beautiful and relaxing town with everything you could ask for and still without the noise from clubs until late night like in Thira!
Firostefani simply is a must to pick!Show moreMGuest review byMrMajklIreland2.0the location is not what it seams, it is just between the...the location is not what it seams, it is just between the main road and other construction sites or empty fields, with no nice view.
