you’re thinking of Santorini. Protectively curving around 4 other islands in its archipelago, this volcanic island has fertile ground bringing forth lovely rosé wine and some of the sweetest cherry tomatoes you’ll ever taste.High on a caldera shelving into the sea, the capital Fira overlooks the cruise liners plying the turquoise Aegean waters below. North is Imerovigli, home to several 5-star Santorini hotels with fantastic views. Also providing amazing views is the accommodation in Oia across the bay. Cascading down the slopes, the sea of white here is only dispersed by vibrant pink flowers, blue domes and the brown of ancient windmills, all becoming black silhouettes as the sun sets.Santorini Airport is on the other side of the island and 2 resorts south of it – Kamari and Perissa – have the best, black sand beaches. However, the most visually impressive is Red Beach at Akrotiri where the stunning red colour of the caldera and sand makes the trek down the rockface well worth it. Just time it right to avoid high tide! Also near Akrotiri are excavations of a Minoan era settlement.Wherever you choose to stay, Booking.com has a fantastic range of B&Bs, apartments and hotels in Santorini (Thira in Greek).See reviews by guests who stayed at hotels on SantoriniSee allLouis Studios SantoriniKamariFrom £88.95 per nightScored out of 10, guest rating 9.59.5Exceptional - What previous guests thought, 253 reviews Exceptional · 253 reviewsOur stay was perfect.

The staff has been extremely nice to us, from Dimitris, Mr Nikolas, Cristina, everyone has always been kind and ready to answer all of our questions and requests.
There is also a market within 20meters, where you can buy everything you might need.
The room were very very clean, our towels were changed every day.
The position is definitely the best to visit the island, because you can reach every spot in a few minutes (the furthest place is 25 minutes distant).

It can be expensive so plan a little extra money for food though! There are plenty of things to do an see in the town and the public transport to other areas of the island are quite frequent and cheap. There are lots of steep inclines and stairs so keep that in mind, you'll be doing a lot of walking up hillsShow moreLGuest review byLawson6.0Oia is stunning, especially at sunset, but in September it...Oia is stunning, especially at sunset, but in September it felt overrun with cruise ship crowds and influencers.
We loved our simple apartment with its incredible views, starry nights, and the local cats and donkeys. Food and wine are excellent but expensive, and swimming isn’t easy without hiring a car or scooter.
Beautiful to see once, but not ideal if you’re on a budget or want a relaxed swim-and-rest holiday.Show moregGuest review bygowc28United Kingdom8.0We loved our accommodation at thousand stars and highly...We loved our accommodation at thousand stars and highly recommend it.
Took a private highlight tour of the island which was amazing.
Negatives on Kamari include swimming at the beach which was very hazardous when entering and leaving the water due to the lava levels underfoot.
Also, being constantly hassled by the same people to take a massage.Show moreDGuest review byDeirdreIreland10.0Glad I booked Imerovigli over Oia or Fira.Glad I booked Imerovigli over Oia or Fira.
It was quieter, more affordable, has amazing views and walking distance to great restaurants.
We ate at the White Lounge and La Moustache which were both fantastic.
Also easily accessible from the road without too many steps.
Highly recommend!Show moreNGuest review byNickyBAustralia10.0Having stayed two weeks in Perissa, I dare say I know it a...Having stayed two weeks in Perissa, I dare say I know it a bit. It's a great mix of not too big of a town, plenty of groceries shopping spots, Restaurants with some great offers, nice beaches (even though one has to get used to black sand) and cultural spots like a very nice Orthodox Church and some historic ruins if you dare to hike a bit. It's wasn't too crowded either, so if you consider going, do so Early - Mid September.Show moreSGuest review bySherman SiegeLuxembourg8.0A village with bakery, gyros place, souvenir shop & good...A village with bakery, gyros place, souvenir shop & good sized mini market.

Restaurants were excellent and staff in them very polite and attentive.
Greece is not cheap these days so you have to pay the same as in UK for meals etc.
Wine is very expensive but nice to see that they only sell Greek wine in supermarkets and restaurants.Show moreEGuest review byElaineUnited Kingdom10.0If you visit Santorini, don’t miss this village: authentic,...If you visit Santorini, don’t miss this village: authentic, charming, and far less crowded than other areas.
