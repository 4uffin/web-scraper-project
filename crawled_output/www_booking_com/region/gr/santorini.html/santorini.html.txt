SSaharFromNetherlandsA Luxurious Gem with Unparalleled Views
My recent stay at One of One Hotel in Santorini was nothing short of extraordinary. This newly built hotel, which I experienced during its soft opening, has quickly become one of my favorite places to stay. From top to bottom, this is a truly beautiful hotel, with amazing suites that exude both elegance and simplicity. The attention to detail in the interior design is remarkable, everything is thoughtfully arranged and fully equipped with all the modern amenities you could need.
The view from the hotel is something else entirely. I’ve traveled extensively, but I’ve never seen anything quite like the panoramic vistas offered here. The caldera, the sea, and the horizon all blend into one breathtaking scene that is best enjoyed from the more expensive suite options. Trust me, the extra investment is worth it for the incredible views you see in the photos—they have multiple rooms with different perspectives, so choose wisely.
The staff at One of One Hotel truly made our stay memorable, particularly Eva, who was an outstanding host. Eva’s kindness, attentiveness, and genuine care for her guests made us feel incredibly welcome. She was always ready to help with a smile, and her warmth was one of the main reasons we loved our stay here. The hotel is very fortunate to have her on their team.
While the hotel’s location in Imerovigli offers a peaceful and secluded atmosphere, it is worth noting that it’s not in the city center. If you plan to explore more of Santorini, you’ll definitely need a car or be prepared for the cost of taxis, which can be expensive on the island. Renting a car is likely the most cost-effective option for getting around.
One minor point is that the hotel’s sauna, spa, and restaurant were not yet completed during our stay, but I understand they are expected to open next year. In the meantime, we found a convenient solution by ordering breakfast through the Wolt app, which worked perfectly.Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.89.8Exceptional - What previous guests thought, 280 reviewsExceptional 280 reviewsPrice from$763.091 night, 2 adultsCheck availabilityArxegono Cave Houses SantoriniHotel in PyrgosLocated in Pyrgos and with Santorini Port reachable within 3.4 miles, Arxegono Cave Houses Santorini provides concierge services, non-smoking rooms, a garden, free WiFi throughout the property and a...MMichaelFromUnited StatesWe loved everything about this property: the location, interior decoration, architecture, views of Santorini and the sea.

Apostolia by the front desk, Thanasis by the restaurant and of course Aris for having such a team are absolutely worth a mention. Breakfast was full of Mediterranean taste and super matching the ambience of the insane caldera view. As it comes to the room we were so surprised with the state of the art sound system, the size of the bed, the cleanliness of the room and the lovely jacuzzi! We definitely recommend the hotel for anyone travelling to Santorini. Through whatsapp they arranged anything we asked for and we couldn’t be happier. Transfer to the airport and back was arranged by the hotel, restaurant reservations, wine tours, boat tours and although we didn’t rent a car, we could through the hotel. So easy and possible.

I was concerned to begin with as there aren’t many sunbeds around the main pool for the amount of people in the hotel but when we had our own it was perfect!! There was also another very helpful lady who told us it would be 60€ to the port but when she rung she managed to get it down to 40€ which was another nice touch (rather than just telling us that’s what the price was).

Comfort, style, luxury. Hosts were very accommodating. They stayed awake late into the night to ensure that our checkin was smooth. The view from the top is beautiful. The style of the buildings are what you want in Santorini.Show moreAGuest review byAmitMexicoLouis Studios SantoriniKamariFrom $119.93 per nightScored out of 10, guest rating 9.59.5Exceptional - What previous guests thought, 254 reviews Exceptional · 254 reviewsVery clean and helpful staff.

It can be expensive so plan a little extra money for food though! There are plenty of things to do an see in the town and the public transport to other areas of the island are quite frequent and cheap. There are lots of steep inclines and stairs so keep that in mind, you'll be doing a lot of walking up hillsShow moreLGuest review byLawson6.0Oia is stunning, especially at sunset, but in September it...Oia is stunning, especially at sunset, but in September it felt overrun with cruise ship crowds and influencers.
We loved our simple apartment with its incredible views, starry nights, and the local cats and donkeys. Food and wine are excellent but expensive, and swimming isn’t easy without hiring a car or scooter.
Beautiful to see once, but not ideal if you’re on a budget or want a relaxed swim-and-rest holiday.Show moregGuest review bygowc28United Kingdom8.0We loved our accommodation at thousand stars and highly...We loved our accommodation at thousand stars and highly recommend it.
Took a private highlight tour of the island which was amazing.
Negatives on Kamari include swimming at the beach which was very hazardous when entering and leaving the water due to the lava levels underfoot.
Also, being constantly hassled by the same people to take a massage.Show moreDGuest review byDeirdreIreland10.0Glad I booked Imerovigli over Oia or Fira.Glad I booked Imerovigli over Oia or Fira.
It was quieter, more affordable, has amazing views and walking distance to great restaurants.
We ate at the White Lounge and La Moustache which were both fantastic.
Also easily accessible from the road without too many steps.
Highly recommend!Show moreNGuest review byNickyBAustralia10.0Visiting Perissa in September was perfect – warm weather and...Visiting Perissa in September was perfect – warm weather and plenty of sunbeds, or you can simply relax on the soft sand mixed with small pebbles. A short walk down the beach takes you to Perivolos, which is even better for swimming. Along the beach, you’ll find plenty of excellent restaurants and bars – Tranquilo and Ntomatini are must-visits! In the evenings, it’s lovely to stroll past the many little souvenir shops and enjoy the relaxed atmosphere.Show moreUGuest review byUršaSlovenia8.0A village with bakery, gyros place, souvenir shop & good...A village with bakery, gyros place, souvenir shop & good sized mini market.

Restaurants were excellent and staff in them very polite and attentive.
Greece is not cheap these days so you have to pay the same as in UK for meals etc.
Wine is very expensive but nice to see that they only sell Greek wine in supermarkets and restaurants.Show moreEGuest review byElaineUnited Kingdom10.0If you visit Santorini, don’t miss this village: authentic,...If you visit Santorini, don’t miss this village: authentic, charming, and far less crowded than other areas.
