The beach is beautiful and perfect for sunset walks, and the vibe overall feels more relaxed.
I loved how you can find cheap local warungs serving delicious food right alongside more fancy restaurants and bars — so there’s something for every mood and budget. It’s also easy to get around, with plenty of shops, spas, and cafés tucked into quiet little streets.
Seminyak really gave me that mix of laid-back holiday vibes while still having everything I needed nearby. I’d definitely come back!Show moredGuest review bydelaneyAustralia8.0Parts were lovely and the cliffs around the temple were...Parts were lovely and the cliffs around the temple were amazing but be prepared for lots of traffic (especially scooters) so it takes a while to get anywhere and the public bits are a bit grotty.
Couple of amazing places to eat (eg Nourish) and plenty of lovely massage options - we went to Zahra.
Highly recommend going to a sunset dance performance - absolutely amazing!Show moreNGuest review byNZ PennyNew Zealand8.0Love Sanur as traffic not too busy.Love Sanur as traffic not too busy. Foot paths are a mess at present but will be very good when completed. Footpaths on beach are excellent. A lot of the little beach cafes have gone which was very disappointing.Show morePGuest review byPaulineAustralia6.0Unfortunately , NP seems to have far too many visitors for...Unfortunately , NP seems to have far too many visitors for what the road infrastructure can handle .
The roads to all the local sightseeing hotspots are not wide enough for oncoming vehicle to pass each other without driving on the shoulder of the road ( if it exists ) and constantly causing further damage ,.
The roads surfaced are very badly broken a terribly pot- holed .
Vehicle journeys to the popular destinations take an inordinately long time with traffic banked up while cars try to pass each other when they can .
On the plus ; the restaurants and beach clubs and bars serve excellent food and live music nightly was easy to find . And entertaining .
The coastline scenery is fantastic . Itis why so many people make trip .
The fast ferry services from Sanur to NP are very good and only 30 minutes .Show morePGuest review byPhilbobagginsAustralia10.0We liked the central location in Legian.We liked the central location in Legian. Hawkers should not attend hotel, this is rest time from shopping and bartering. Pad on Bene was our favourite place to eat anytime. Good food.Fat Tony’s burgers great. Water BOM amazing, our son went 4 times during our stay with great water slides. Traffic congestion to Changu and Ubud was horrendous. Took 2 hours for such a small distance.Show moreAGuest review byAnonymous10.0friendly, charming, plenty to see, however seeing so much...friendly, charming, plenty to see, however seeing so much rubbish / trash lying about took away some of the 'shine'.
Possibly the establishment of an organisation ?volunteer or ?commercial to recycle plastics (bottles)
could certainly assist in recycling some of the plastics. There was one eating establishment which was doing it's very best to get the message across about limiting / recycling plastics!Show morepGuest review bypaulineAustralia4.0We spent two nights at the end of our holiday in this area.We spent two nights at the end of our holiday in this area.
It was not for us.
The area is dominated by large resorts and the main activities centre around surfing, or hanging out in a pricey resort/bar, or perhaps viewing artifical tourist sights.
Admittedly some resorts are very nice and have nice views but it's not really my style of holiday to spend several hundred dollars to lounge on a sunbed on the coast.
There are plenty of higher end places to eat in this area, but I didn't go to Indonesia to eat western food.
The Indonesian options feel very samey and were better in other areas with more Indonesian diners.
Even Ubud with its hordes of people felt more authentically like Bali than this area does.
In all, if you want a resort style holiday or are a wealthy surfer then this is the area for you.
If you want to mosey around and get a feel for Bali it is not.
For other watersports, it would be better to go north e.g. for diving/snorkelling.
Or go to another island altogether.Show moreAGuest review byAlexanderNew ZealandResearch, refine, and make plans for your whole tripHotels near Ngurah Rai International AirportFind hotels conveniently close to the area's most popular airport – perfect for a late arrival or early departure.Hotels in UbudA popular choice with guests visiting Bali.Hotels in CangguA popular choice with guests visiting Bali.Hotels in Nusa Dua peninsulaTake a look at properties in a destination nearby.Hotels in GianyarTake a look at properties in a destination nearby.Hotels in IndonesiaSet off to explore the whole country.Villas in BaliStill looking for the perfect place to stay?
