Their "Ubud escape" motto could not be more accurate, as it is a beautiful gem in the middle of the jungle, far from the busy town. I booked a Premier Pool Villa, but got upgraded to the Royal Villa. It was an absolute surprise! It's an extra spacious property with every facility you could wish for (they even have a mini kitchen in the pool area with a beverage stocked fridge) and if we hadn't booked any activities in advance, I think I would have spent 3 whole days by it's pool, just enjoying the greenery, the sound of the river nearby, the privacy & comfort that it offers.
I loved the entrance to the rooms, the wooden door with offerings is a nice touch as it really transmits that Balinese feeling.
Also, in short:
- food is really good, many options, large portions. We also joined their BBQ dinner one night, which was very nice.
- they offer shuttle services to and from Ubud town
- they provide a whatsapp number for communication & infos, which is very helpful
- SPA service is amazing, worth booking a massage
- staff is friendly and happy to help anytime. We arrived very late for our check-in and they were so considerate and prepared some sandwiches for us to enjoy. It meant the world!
I may be forced to come back again :)

I spent 5nights but feel like I needed 3-4 more.
Great town, great locals, terrible traffic!Show moreSGuest review bySuAustralia2.0Not for someone who likes a calm stay - too crowded, too...Not for someone who likes a calm stay - too crowded, too many shops selling the same stuff, all the people trying to scam you. luckily we had one honest taxi driver who told us not to buy anything on the streets - buy all your souvenirs from Krisna Oleh Oleh - fixed price and ends up cheaper than the street. Its ok for young party people. Would rather stay in Nusa Dua for a nice calm stay.Show moreDGuest review byDINESHUnited States10.0Canggu has everything I look for in a Bali trip.Canggu has everything I look for in a Bali trip. Great waves for surfing cool beach clubs all-day cafés amazing food and some of the best spas I have ever tried. The vibe is laid back but still full of life. Everything is super close so you can walk or ride a bike and never get bored. One minute you are in a quiet rice field the next you are in a trendy restaurant or catching sunset at the beach. It is a place where you can relax have fun and feel like you are part of something cool without it being too much.Show moreMGuest review byMihaiRomania2.0Don book this hotel. The staff is horrible.Don book this hotel. The staff is horrible. The worst is the f&b manager . The hotel is operating without a GM and no one is bothered about guest experience. Don make a mistake staying here! Don waste money as it is the worst hotel for the rate one pays. No cutleries , staff not bothered, no replenishment , just horrible in summary !Show moreKGuest review byKiranMalaysia8.0Parts were lovely and the cliffs around the temple were...Parts were lovely and the cliffs around the temple were amazing but be prepared for lots of traffic (especially scooters) so it takes a while to get anywhere and the public bits are a bit grotty.
Couple of amazing places to eat (eg Nourish) and plenty of lovely massage options - we went to Zahra.
Highly recommend going to a sunset dance performance - absolutely amazing!Show moreNGuest review byNZ PennyNew Zealand8.0Love Sanur as traffic not too busy.Love Sanur as traffic not too busy.

Possibly the establishment of an organisation ?volunteer or ?commercial to recycle plastics (bottles)
could certainly assist in recycling some of the plastics. There was one eating establishment which was doing it's very best to get the message across about limiting / recycling plastics!Show morepGuest review bypaulineAustralia4.0We spent two nights at the end of our holiday in this area.We spent two nights at the end of our holiday in this area.
It was not for us.
The area is dominated by large resorts and the main activities centre around surfing, or hanging out in a pricey resort/bar, or perhaps viewing artifical tourist sights.
Admittedly some resorts are very nice and have nice views but it's not really my style of holiday to spend several hundred dollars to lounge on a sunbed on the coast.
There are plenty of higher end places to eat in this area, but I didn't go to Indonesia to eat western food.
The Indonesian options feel very samey and were better in other areas with more Indonesian diners.
Even Ubud with its hordes of people felt more authentically like Bali than this area does.
In all, if you want a resort style holiday or are a wealthy surfer then this is the area for you.
If you want to mosey around and get a feel for Bali it is not.
For other watersports, it would be better to go north e.g. for diving/snorkelling.
Or go to another island altogether.Show moreAGuest review byAlexanderNew ZealandResearch, refine and make plans for your whole tripHotels near Ngurah Rai International AirportFind hotels conveniently close to the area's most popular airport – perfect for a late arrival or early departure.Hotels in Nusa Dua peninsulaTake a look at properties in a destination nearby.Hotels in GianyarTake a look at properties in a destination nearby.Cheap holidays in SanurBook the best flights, stays and more – all in one placeHotels on BatamDiscover another popular destination within Indonesia.Hotels on LombokDiscover another popular destination within Indonesia.Car hire near Ngurah Rai International AirportFlying in to Ngurah Rai International Airport and need to hire a car?
