The pool especially the upper pool by the bar was just exquisite and stylish. The staff so attentive and special. I chose to stay on the grounds more than out and about because it was quiet and peaceful here. This was the one establishment I have stayed on my month in Bali that was adult only and as I am not tolerant at all of kids noises and play and sounds omg this Boutique Hotel was such a pleasure being ADULTS only. I am finding all the families with crying kids and unbehaved kids monopolizing pools come here in high season to Bali. Thank you Bali Eco Gravity Hotel for not allowing kids!

We will come back to stay here again after visiting other places in Bali. It's beautiful to have a pool surrounded by a green garden. There are many good restaurants along the street and it's a 7-10 min walk to the beach. We didn't need a scooter as everything was within walking distance.
The room was spacious, that's why we picked it and we were happy with the size and air-conditioning. Good that we had a mini-fridge. It's quiet at night and an oasis from the busy traffic on the streets. Nice, firm mattress. The pillow was a bit too hard for my taste.

It has wonderful cafes (Milk and Madu), beach clubs (La Brisa), restaurants (Longtime; Lulu’s), clubs and bistros (Margaret bistro). There’s also yoga, fitness and spas. It ticks all the boxes. Just be mindful when ordering salads, vegetable juice or iced drinks from certain places, as the tap water is not potable. It is also a short distance away from Seminyak (which has a lot of shopping; our kid loves places like Stroberi, Kids à gogo and Candyland).Show moreAGuest review byAnonymous2.0Don book this hotel. The staff is horrible.Don book this hotel. The staff is horrible. The worst is the f&b manager . The hotel is operating without a GM and no one is bothered about guest experience. Don make a mistake staying here! Don waste money as it is the worst hotel for the rate one pays. No cutleries , staff not bothered, no replenishment , just horrible in summary !Show moreKGuest review byKiranMalaysia8.0Parts were lovely and the cliffs around the temple were...Parts were lovely and the cliffs around the temple were amazing but be prepared for lots of traffic (especially scooters) so it takes a while to get anywhere and the public bits are a bit grotty.
Couple of amazing places to eat (eg Nourish) and plenty of lovely massage options - we went to Zahra.
Highly recommend going to a sunset dance performance - absolutely amazing!Show moreNGuest review byNZ PennyNew Zealand8.0Love Sanur as traffic not too busy.Love Sanur as traffic not too busy. Foot paths are a mess at present but will be very good when completed. Footpaths on beach are excellent. A lot of the little beach cafes have gone which was very disappointing.Show morePGuest review byPaulineAustralia6.0Unfortunately , NP seems to have far too many visitors for...Unfortunately , NP seems to have far too many visitors for what the road infrastructure can handle .
The roads to all the local sightseeing hotspots are not wide enough for oncoming vehicle to pass each other without driving on the shoulder of the road ( if it exists ) and constantly causing further damage ,.
The roads surfaced are very badly broken a terribly pot- holed .
Vehicle journeys to the popular destinations take an inordinately long time with traffic banked up while cars try to pass each other when they can .
On the plus ; the restaurants and beach clubs and bars serve excellent food and live music nightly was easy to find . And entertaining .
The coastline scenery is fantastic . Itis why so many people make trip .
The fast ferry services from Sanur to NP are very good and only 30 minutes .Show morePGuest review byPhilbobagginsAustralia10.0I love Legian, the beach is magic.I love Legian, the beach is magic. The western restaurants and cafes and shocking, food is rubbish, over priced, lazy staff. Filthy smokers never consider non smokers and feel it’s ok to smoke while people eat.

Possibly the establishment of an organisation ?volunteer or ?commercial to recycle plastics (bottles)
could certainly assist in recycling some of the plastics. There was one eating establishment which was doing it's very best to get the message across about limiting / recycling plastics!Show morepGuest review bypaulineAustralia4.0We spent two nights at the end of our holiday in this area.We spent two nights at the end of our holiday in this area.
It was not for us.
The area is dominated by large resorts and the main activities centre around surfing, or hanging out in a pricey resort/bar, or perhaps viewing artifical tourist sights.
Admittedly some resorts are very nice and have nice views but it's not really my style of holiday to spend several hundred dollars to lounge on a sunbed on the coast.
There are plenty of higher end places to eat in this area, but I didn't go to Indonesia to eat western food.
The Indonesian options feel very samey and were better in other areas with more Indonesian diners.
Even Ubud with its hordes of people felt more authentically like Bali than this area does.
In all, if you want a resort style holiday or are a wealthy surfer then this is the area for you.
If you want to mosey around and get a feel for Bali it is not.
For other watersports, it would be better to go north e.g. for diving/snorkelling.
Or go to another island altogether.Show moreAGuest review byAlexanderNew ZealandResearch, refine, and make plans for your whole tripCheap vacations in SanurPlan everything you need for your vacation in one place – from flights and stays to tours and activitiesHotels in UbudA popular choice with guests visiting Bali.Hotels in CangguA popular choice with guests visiting Bali.Villas in BaliExplore more great accommodation options for your trip.Hostels in BaliExplore more great accommodation options for your trip.Hotels in Nusa Dua peninsulaTake a look at properties in a destination nearby.Hotels in GianyarThinking about a longer trip?
