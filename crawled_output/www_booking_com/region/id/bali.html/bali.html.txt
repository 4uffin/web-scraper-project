This 4-star hotel offers a bar....KKendraFromCanadaI loved everything about my stay here! It started with a cute welcome drink and little appetizer which was a very nice surprise. The staff were extremely attentive and kind, the pool was clean and larger than I expected. I will say I was surprised at the noise from the road, but that was because my own ignorance, I didn’t realize how busy Canggu was (I’ve never been to Bali). I was out exploring most of the time anyways, and the location of the hotel was perfect for exploring. Was super easy to get a Grab Scooter or exploring by foot.
The rooms were spacious and clean, showers had nice hot water.
I booked the Deluxe room with Pool, treated myself! It would be a really cute set up for a couple travelling together. The bed was comfortable, the wifi worked great, Netflix worked clear as a bell. The restaurant on site was also very good. I’m surprised it wasn’t busier to be honest, it’s a hidden gem. Seriously no complaints about my stay here, would recommend and would book again :) Also, hot tip, Sensorium, a restaurant like a 3 minute walk up the street is incredible. Copy and pasted my review from trip advisor because I was too lazy to write it again, but everything is true and true. Loved my time here.Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.19.1Wonderful - What previous guests thought, 1,039 reviewsWonderful 1,039 reviewsLocation 8.9Price from$99.591 night, 2 adultsCheck availabilityTerra Cottages BaliHotel in UluwatuLocated in Uluwatu, 1.1 miles from Cemongkak Beach, Terra Cottages Bali has accommodations with an outdoor swimming pool, free private parking, a garden and a restaurant.

We loved staying at Weda Cita Hotel. The staff were super nice—special thanks to Juni and Eka for being so kind, and honestly, everyone on the team was always smiling and greeting us warmly. The place itself is beautiful, with a great atmosphere. The rooms are spacious, spotless, and very comfortable.
The pool area is lovely, and the hotel’s restaurant serves one of the best breakfasts we’ve ever had. There’s a lot of food and plenty of variety to choose from.
Thank you to all the staff for making our stay so wonderful.

It was not for us.
The area is dominated by large resorts and the main activities centre around surfing, or hanging out in a pricey resort/bar, or perhaps viewing artifical tourist sights.
Admittedly some resorts are very nice and have nice views but it's not really my style of holiday to spend several hundred dollars to lounge on a sunbed on the coast.
There are plenty of higher end places to eat in this area, but I didn't go to Indonesia to eat western food.
The Indonesian options feel very samey and were better in other areas with more Indonesian diners.
Even Ubud with its hordes of people felt more authentically like Bali than this area does.
In all, if you want a resort style holiday or are a wealthy surfer then this is the area for you.
If you want to mosey around and get a feel for Bali it is not.
For other watersports, it would be better to go north e.g. for diving/snorkelling.
Or go to another island altogether.Show moreAGuest review byAlexanderNew ZealandResearch, refine, and make plans for your whole tripHotels on BatamHit the road and make the most of your trip by discovering another popular destination in Indonesia.Hotels on LombokDiscover another popular destination in Indonesia.Car rental near Ngurah Rai International AirportPick up your rental car as soon as you land.Hotels in UbudA popular choice with guests visiting Bali.Hotels in CangguA popular choice with guests visiting Bali.Flights to BaliGetting to Bali just got easier!Hotels near Ngurah Rai International AirportFind hotels conveniently close to the area's most popular airport – perfect for a late arrival or early departure.Hotels near Mount BaturPlaces to stay with a popular tourist attraction nearby.Hotels near Tegallalang Rice TerracePlaces to stay with a popular tourist attraction nearby.Show moreCountriesRegionsCitiesDistrictsAirportsHotelsPlaces of interestVacation HomesApartmentsResortsVillasHostelsB&BsGuest HousesUnique places to stayAll destinationsAll flight destinationsAll car rental locationsAll vacation destinationsGuidesDiscoverReviewsDiscover monthly staysSupportCoronavirus (COVID-19) FAQsManage your tripsContact Customer ServiceSafety Resource CenterDiscoverGenius loyalty programSeasonal and holiday dealsTravel articlesBooking.com for BusinessTraveller Review AwardsCar rentalFlight finderRestaurant reservationsBooking.com for Travel AgentsTerms and settingsPrivacy & cookiesTerms of ServiceAccessibility StatementDispute resolutionModern Slavery StatementHuman Rights StatementPartnersExtranet loginPartner helpList your propertyBecome an affiliateAboutAbout Booking.comHow We WorkSustainabilityPress centerCareersInvestor relationsCorporate contactUSDBooking.com is part of Booking Holdings Inc., the world leader in online travel and related services.
