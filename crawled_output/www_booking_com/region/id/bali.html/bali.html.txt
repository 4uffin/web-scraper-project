Immaculate clean bathroom and enticing own private pool. The public pool was also amazing. We also availed the balinese massage with body scrub. Mary, Purnami and Lika were amazing. That was the best massage and spa ever plus its not that expensive compared to the popular ones in Seminyak. Amazing and we will be back. Yuli, the receptionist was very welcoming as well. Thank you and we’ll see you again.

It was not for us.
The area is dominated by large resorts and the main activities centre around surfing, or hanging out in a pricey resort/bar, or perhaps viewing artifical tourist sights.
Admittedly some resorts are very nice and have nice views but it's not really my style of holiday to spend several hundred dollars to lounge on a sunbed on the coast.
There are plenty of higher end places to eat in this area, but I didn't go to Indonesia to eat western food.
The Indonesian options feel very samey and were better in other areas with more Indonesian diners.
Even Ubud with its hordes of people felt more authentically like Bali than this area does.
In all, if you want a resort style holiday or are a wealthy surfer then this is the area for you.
If you want to mosey around and get a feel for Bali it is not.
For other watersports, it would be better to go north e.g. for diving/snorkelling.
Or go to another island altogether.Show moreAGuest review byAlexanderNew ZealandResearch, refine, and make plans for your whole tripHotels near Mount BaturFind hotels close to Mount Batur, a popular tourist attraction for visitors heading to the same area of Indonesia.Hotels near Tegallalang Rice TerracePlaces to stay with a popular tourist attraction nearby.Hotels in UbudA popular choice with guests visiting Bali.Hotels in CangguA popular choice with guests visiting Bali.Hotels in IndonesiaSet off to explore the whole country.Flights to BaliGetting to Bali just got easier!Villas in BaliStill looking for the perfect place to stay?
