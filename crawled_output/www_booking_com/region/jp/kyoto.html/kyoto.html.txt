This hotel is across the street from Kyoto Station and Aeon Mall is around the corner so it's ideal.
Our twin rooms were in the main building so they were slightly dated but for the price that we paid, that is to be expected.
The main thing is the rooms were very clean.
People also may find a lack of floor space for everyone to open up luggage if you are in the main building.

The only confusion was that the description on Booking.com states that breakfast is available, it doesn’t say that you pay extra for it. I also paid for towels. If I understand correctly the coat is then deducted from the room fee but it really wasn’t clear.Show moreCGuest review byCatherineCanada10.0Gionmachi is a wonderful section of Kyoto and offers much to...Gionmachi is a wonderful section of Kyoto and offers much to see and experience.
It is easy, maybe 15 to 20 minutes taxi to other areas of Kyoto that are also beautiful, historical and traditional.
Overall, this is a place I would come back to because I have much more to see.Show moreAGuest review byAlanUnited States8.0September was much too hot and humid for a visit.September was much too hot and humid for a visit. Not sure when is cooler, though!
The key tourist sites are overrun now, so head for the “atypical” locations - there are so many temples you don’t have to see the usual ones. Nijo-Jo castle is a must, but go later in the day to avoid crowds.
Make sure you try the really small kitchen/resurants, where some of the cooking is exceptional.Show moreDGuest review byDavidUnited Kingdom10.0Lots of tourists on holidays but pretty peaceful on normal...Lots of tourists on holidays but pretty peaceful on normal days. The beach was great but I think they limit the days you can swim. Nice stroll along the sandbar. Amanohashidate is the main thing, there's nothing much to do in Ine aside from taking the boat tour. It's probably best to take the tour that starts from Amanohashidate and goes straight to Ine if you want to save time.Show moreAGuest review byAshwenPhilippines10.0I especially recommend it to travelers from overseas.I especially recommend it to travelers from overseas.
If you are sightseeing in Kyoto, Nara, or Osaka for a few days, staying at this facility and using Kameoka as your base will be the best way to travel to Kansai.
Like taking a day trip from your home.
If your schedule is 2 nights and 3 days or 3 nights and 4 days, it is definitely a good deal even if you add transportation expenses. You can't stay in a house in Kyoto or Nara.Show moreeGuest review byeltopoJapan10.0I loved this hotel!!! The service was outstanding.I loved this hotel!!! The service was outstanding. The rooms were beautiful and clean. The location was perfect - close to town but not in town.
We walked everywhere and felt very safe. Close to the train station as well. I will certainly stay here on my next trip to Kyoto.Show moreCGuest review byCatherineUnited StatesResearch, refine, and make plans for your whole tripHotels in Mount Fuji Hit the road and make the most of your trip by discovering another popular destination in Japan.Hotels in Osaka PrefectureDiscover another popular destination in Japan.Hotels in KinkiTake a look at properties in a destination nearby.Hotels in KyotoA popular choice with guests visiting Kyoto.Hotels in MaizuruA popular choice with guests visiting Kyoto.Hotels in JapanSet off to explore the whole country.Ryokans in KyotoStill looking for the perfect place to stay?
