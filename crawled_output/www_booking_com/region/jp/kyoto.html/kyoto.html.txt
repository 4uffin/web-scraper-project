This hotel is across the street from Kyoto Station and Aeon Mall is around the corner so it's ideal.
Our twin rooms were in the main building so they were slightly dated but for the price that we paid, that is to be expected.
The main thing is the rooms were very clean.
People also may find a lack of floor space for everyone to open up luggage if you are in the main building.

The key tourist sites are overrun now, so head for the “atypical” locations - there are so many temples you don’t have to see the usual ones. Nijo-Jo castle is a must, but go later in the day to avoid crowds.

The only confusion was that the description on Booking.com states that breakfast is available, it doesn’t say that you pay extra for it. I also paid for towels. If I understand correctly the coat is then deducted from the room fee but it really wasn’t clear.Show moreCGuest review byCatherineCanada10.0Gionmachi is a wonderful section of Kyoto and offers much to...Gionmachi is a wonderful section of Kyoto and offers much to see and experience.
It is easy, maybe 15 to 20 minutes taxi to other areas of Kyoto that are also beautiful, historical and traditional.
Overall, this is a place I would come back to because I have much more to see.Show moreAGuest review byAlanUnited States8.0Even though one could say compared to any other time in the...Even though one could say compared to any other time in the past that the city is really full of tourists, the local seem to understand and have adjusted. I think it’s obvious that it looks different than most cities in Japan making It forever

The beach was great but I think they limit the days you can swim. Nice stroll along the sandbar. Amanohashidate is the main thing, there's nothing much to do in Ine aside from taking the boat tour. It's probably best to take the tour that starts from Amanohashidate and goes straight to Ine if you want to save time.Show moreAGuest review byAshwenPhilippines10.0I especially recommend it to travelers from overseas.I especially recommend it to travelers from overseas.
If you are sightseeing in Kyoto, Nara, or Osaka for a few days, staying at this facility and using Kameoka as your base will be the best way to travel to Kansai.
Like taking a day trip from your home.
If your schedule is 2 nights and 3 days or 3 nights and 4 days, it is definitely a good deal even if you add transportation expenses. You can't stay in a house in Kyoto or Nara.Show moreeGuest review byeltopoJapan10.0I loved this hotel!!! The service was outstanding.I loved this hotel!!! The service was outstanding. The rooms were beautiful and clean. The location was perfect - close to town but not in town.
We walked everywhere and felt very safe. Close to the train station as well. I will certainly stay here on my next trip to Kyoto.Show moreCGuest review byCatherineUnited StatesResearch, refine, and make plans for your whole tripCheap vacations in KyotoPlan everything you need for your vacation in one place – from flights and stays to tours and activitiesHotels in Mount Fuji Discover another popular destination in Japan.Hotels in Osaka PrefectureDiscover another popular destination in Japan.Hotels in KinkiTake a look at properties in a destination nearby.Ryokans in KyotoExplore more great accommodation options for your trip.Guest Houses in KyotoExplore more great accommodation options for your trip.When to visit JapanEvents, prices, weather – everything you need to know about the best time to visit Japan.Hotels near Nishiki MarketPlaces to stay with a popular tourist attraction nearby.Hotels near AmanohashidatePlaces to stay with a popular tourist attraction nearby.Show moreCountriesRegionsCitiesDistrictsAirportsHotelsPlaces of interestVacation HomesApartmentsResortsVillasHostelsB&BsGuest HousesUnique places to stayAll destinationsAll flight destinationsAll car rental locationsAll vacation destinationsGuidesDiscoverReviewsDiscover monthly staysSupportCoronavirus (COVID-19) FAQsManage your tripsContact Customer ServiceSafety Resource CenterDiscoverGenius loyalty programSeasonal and holiday dealsTravel articlesBooking.com for BusinessTraveller Review AwardsCar rentalFlight finderRestaurant reservationsBooking.com for Travel AgentsTerms and settingsPrivacy & cookiesTerms of ServiceAccessibility StatementDispute resolutionModern Slavery StatementHuman Rights StatementPartnersExtranet loginPartner helpList your propertyBecome an affiliateAboutAbout Booking.comHow We WorkSustainabilityPress centerCareersInvestor relationsCorporate contactUSDBooking.com is part of Booking Holdings Inc., the world leader in online travel and related services.
