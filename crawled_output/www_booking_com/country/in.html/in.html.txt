Wonderful

Located in Mumbai, 2.7 miles from Phoenix Market City Mall, Radisson Blu Mumbai International Airport provides accommodations with an outdoor swimming pool, free private parking, a fitness center and...
The hotel is in line with its class, very modern, Western style and as soon as you enter the lobby, you are greeted by helpful staff. Although we arrived earlier than check-in time, we were given a room quite quickly, they even took us to show us if it was suitable for us. Since we were together with a teenage child, an extra bed was set up. The service is at a high level, all the staff are helpful, room service kept asking if anything was missing, and brought us bottled water. The ventilation in the room works well, the air in the room is pleasantly dry, you don't feel the humidity from outside. There is carpet in the room, so it's cozy. Everything is very clean, there are no smells from either the bedding or artificial fragrances in the corridors. There is a small but good pool on the 11th floor, towels are provided. The restaurant has a pleasant atmosphere, helpful waiters, and dishes are prepared to order for breakfast.

The Taj Mahal Palace, Mumbai
Hotel in South Mumbai, Mumbai
9.1
Wonderful
2,441 reviews
Built in 1903, the iconic Taj Mahal Palace stands majestically opposite the Gateway of India, overlooking the Arabian Sea.
It was the most wonderful experience, we were so well taken care of, and as part of the Club Room, you get access to hi-tea and cocktails which really added to the whole experience. Take the Taj heritage tour! It's 120 years of history told by historians, who have worked at the Taj for more than 40 years. We also had hair services at the Taj Salon, and the service was impeccable. The pool was relaxing and so beautiful. And the best part of the Taj, the staff! Unbeatable service, that made us feel like family coming home.
