Hotel Schani UNO City
Hotel in 22. Donaustadt, Vienna
9.1
Wonderful
1,974 reviews
Located in Vienna, a 13-minute walk from Austria Center Vienna, Hotel Schani UNO City has accommodations with a garden, private parking, a terrace and a restaurant.
I had a truly fantastic stay at this hotel. The room was modern, clean, and quiet, thanks to its excellent soundproofing. It provided a peaceful retreat after a long day, and I appreciated the thoughtful design. The large, bright window let in plenty of natural light, creating a welcoming and refreshing atmosphere.
The bathroom was impressively designed with a clear separation of dry and wet areas, each of the toilet, shower, and washbasin was individually partitioned, making it both hygienic and easy to use. The bed was incredibly soft and comfortable, offering a great nightâ€™s sleep. I also thoroughly enjoyed the breakfast, which featured a wide variety of delicious options to suit different tastes and preferences. It was a wonderful way to start each morning.
The staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful, always greeting guests with a smile and providing assistance when needed. Additionally, the luggage storage service was very convenient and efficiently managed, making check-in and check-out stress-free.
