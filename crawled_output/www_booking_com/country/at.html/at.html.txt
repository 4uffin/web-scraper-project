Spark by Hilton Vienna Donaustadt

Wonderful
6,505 reviews
Conveniently located in the 22 Donaustadt district of Vienna, Spark by Hilton Vienna Donaustadt is located 1.6 miles from Austria Center Vienna, 3 miles from Messe Wien Exhibition and Congress Center...
Excellent, nearly built hotel. The room was very well equipped with a refrigerator. Opening the window automatically shut the air conditioning—very smart. There is a whole building with many restaurants just across the street. The partial closure of the nearby metro station was not a problem; it only added 5 minutes to a train ride.

Wonderful

Attractively set in the center of Vienna, The Leo Grand has à la carte breakfast and free WiFi throughout the property. This 5-star hotel offers room service and a concierge service.
The Leo Grand was a lovely modern hotel inside a beautiful old building. It was is a superb position, we had a view of the church from our room. It was within walking distance to all the attractions in Vienna. The room was very beautiful and the bed was comfy. The staff were very attentive and friendly.
