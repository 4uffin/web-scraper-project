Featuring a tour desk, this property also provides guests with a restaurant. Guest reviewI had an absolutely delightful stay at Hotel Traube! From the moment I arrived, I felt warmly welcomed by the friendly and attentive staff. The hotel is located perfectly in the center of Rattenberg, a charming little village, making it incredibly easy to explore the historic streets, stroll along the river, browse the quaint shops, and soak up the views. I was pleasantly surprised by the number of nice restaurants, bakeries and supermarkets within walking distance.
My room was immaculate, and well-equipped with everything I needed. The bed was super comfortable, and I really appreciated the peaceful atmosphere - perfect for a restful night’s sleep.
Breakfast was a highlight: fresh, local ingredients and a lovely selection of tea / coffee. The traditional charm of the building combined with modern comfort made this a truly memorable experience for me.
I highly recommend Hotel Traube to anyone visiting the Tyrol region. Whether you’re here for the scenery, culture, or just a relaxing getaway, this hotel is a fantastic choice. I’ll definitely be back!Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.99.9Exceptional - What previous guests thought, 18 reviews Exceptional · 18 reviewsFrom $254 per nightHotel im Stift NeubergHotel in Neuberg an der MürzLocated in Neuberg an der Mürz, within 11 miles of Rax and 27 miles of Hochschwab, Hotel im Stift Neuberg provides accommodations with a garden and free WiFi as well as free private parking for guests...Guest reviewLarge rooms, comfortable beds, excellent staff, very good breakfast selection, the glass art, staying in an old
