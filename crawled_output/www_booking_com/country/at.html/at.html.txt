Spark by Hilton Vienna Donaustadt

9.0
Wonderful
6,505 reviews
Conveniently located in the 22 Donaustadt district of Vienna, Spark by Hilton Vienna Donaustadt is located 1.6 miles from Austria Center Vienna, 3 miles from Messe Wien Exhibition and Congress Center...
Excellent, nearly built hotel. The room was very well equipped with a refrigerator. Opening the window automatically shut the air conditioning—very smart. There is a whole building with many restaurants just across the street. The partial closure of the nearby metro station was not a problem; it only added 5 minutes to a train ride.
