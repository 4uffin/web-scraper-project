Seehotel am Kaiserstrand
Hotel in Lochau
9.0
Wonderful
1,309 reviews
Located in Lochau, 2.8 miles from Casino Bregenz, Seehotel am Kaiserstrand provides accommodations with a restaurant, private parking and a bar.
Everything, place is flawless, the decor, the wellness and spa areas, the lake house & swimming/sun deck. The food in the restaurant & breakfast selection top class. Parking very easy, check-in also very easy. Advice: unless you have early checkin, it will be 3pm, so go straight to wellness as you really only have a 3-4 hr window before dinner, especially if you only staying for 1 night. It is not open till 11pm next morning on checkout.
