The on site young owners , who live next door, also manage the hotel and are extremely helpful and knowledgeable about the region, places to visit, restaurants in Ezcaray.
The one local restaurant was very good but only open on Fri-Sun, at least during October but there are also very good restaurants in Ezcaray.
The hotel was immaculate.
