Guest reviewDue to our jobs we get to stay in 5 star hotels multiple times throughout the month and one could say, we can truly judge when it comes to comparing and rating hotels.
Vayu Retreat Villas was very special from the second we arrived until the moment we had to leave.
The owners made us feel welcome and treated us like family. They were very attentive and made our stay an outstanding one.
Everyone is really friendly, from cleaning/gardening to kitchen staff. Food was delicious, whether it was for breakfast or dinner.
The suite really met our taste when it comes to design choices.
Their eye for details, providing good coffee, umbrellas and any service you could possibly need before even asking is excellent. Best part was the private terrace overlooking the surrounding nature.
This place is really peaceful and lets you relax from whatever stress you might have had.Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.69.6Exceptional - What previous guests thought, 50 reviews Exceptional · 50 reviewsFrom $254 per nightHotel HuacasHotel in HuacasHotel Huacas has accommodations in Huacas.

Guest reviewLapazul is an absolute gem—easily one of the most memorable places I’ve stayed at anywhere in the world. The views are simply breathtaking, perched high in the jungle with the ocean in the distance, and the chance to spot local wildlife adds to the magic. The rooms are spacious, beautifully designed, and have everything you need to truly relax.
But what really sets Lapazul apart is the top-notch hospitality. The warmth and attention to detail from the staff is among the best I’ve ever experienced—genuine, personal, and truly caring. Special mention to Mr. Jorge, whose first-class service and warm presence made us feel incredibly welcome. He is, without a doubt, one of the best hosts I’ve ever encountered at any hotel in the world.
And the food? Outstanding. Every dish is full of flavor and heart, far surpassing the local restaurants in town. The menu is focused and perfectly executed, with ingredients that shine. You can taste the passion in every bite.
If you’re looking to disconnect from the world and reconnect with nature and comfort, this is the place. Plus, it’s just a short drive down to the beach at Dominical. I can’t recommend it enough.Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.89.8Exceptional - What previous guests thought, 79 reviews Exceptional · 79 reviewsFrom $316 per nightHotel Casa Buenavista - Adults onlyHotel in SámaraCasa Buenavista is located in Carrillo, 984 feet from the beach.
