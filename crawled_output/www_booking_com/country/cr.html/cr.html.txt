Centrally located in Puerto Viejo de Talamanca town center and just a 3-minute walk from Salsa Brava Beach, Hotel Indalo adults only features an extensive garden, sun terrace and free Wi-Fi.
Really comfortable and private hotel for a great price in Puerto Viejo. We loved the size and layout of the room, the patio area and the pool was a nice bonus. It was close to everything but far enough that there was no traffic noise or music from the local clubs. Filtered water and coffee offered daily was great and the staff were friendly and helpful.
