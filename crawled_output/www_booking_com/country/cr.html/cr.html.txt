The kids didn’t want to leave it and it felt like a private pool. I will be recommending this place to all our friends.Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.79.7Exceptional - What previous guests thought, 28 reviews Exceptional · 28 reviewsFrom $99 per nightHotel Contenedores CorporativosHotel in PlatanalLocated in Platanal, 20 miles from La Fortuna Waterfall, Hotel Contenedores Corporativos provides accommodations with a garden, free private parking and a terrace.

Guest reviewLapazul is an absolute gem—easily one of the most memorable places I’ve stayed at anywhere in the world. The views are simply breathtaking, perched high in the jungle with the ocean in the distance, and the chance to spot local wildlife adds to the magic. The rooms are spacious, beautifully designed, and have everything you need to truly relax.
But what really sets Lapazul apart is the top-notch hospitality. The warmth and attention to detail from the staff is among the best I’ve ever experienced—genuine, personal, and truly caring. Special mention to Mr. Jorge, whose first-class service and warm presence made us feel incredibly welcome. He is, without a doubt, one of the best hosts I’ve ever encountered at any hotel in the world.
And the food? Outstanding. Every dish is full of flavor and heart, far surpassing the local restaurants in town. The menu is focused and perfectly executed, with ingredients that shine. You can taste the passion in every bite.
If you’re looking to disconnect from the world and reconnect with nature and comfort, this is the place. Plus, it’s just a short drive down to the beach at Dominical. I can’t recommend it enough.Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.89.8Exceptional - What previous guests thought, 79 reviews Exceptional · 79 reviewsFrom $342 per nightHotel Casa Buenavista - Adults onlyHotel in SámaraCasa Buenavista is located in Carrillo, 984 feet from the beach.
