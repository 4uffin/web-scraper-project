Discover the charm of Hotel Secreto La Fortuna, a quiet retreat in the heart of Fortuna, Costa Rica.
Probably the best choice of a hotel in La Fortuna town - spotlessly clean room, incredibly friendly staff, amazing garden and of course,
the volcano view. 5 min walk to all restaurants, sodas ans shops in La Fortuna. There is a resident ü¶• and we had numerous sitings of iguanas and birds.
