Hotel Villas Rio Mar
Hotel in Dominical
9.1
Wonderful
1,151 reviews
Located on the banks of River Baru, Hotel Villas R√≠o Mar is also within a walking distance of 2953 feet from the Village of Dominical.
I love this place. üòç
The restaurant/bar is fab.
The gardens are magnificent.
My room was perfectly nice, and the bathroom was large. There's also a little terrace for chilling outside, in privacy.
The pool area is wonderful, and a second pool for exercise is very useful.
It's also in a great location - next to the river, and a short, flat drive to Dominical.
Absolutely loved it, and will definitely stay longer next time. ü§©

Wonderful
1,209 reviews
Centrally located in Puerto Viejo de Talamanca town center and just a 3-minute walk from Salsa Brava Beach, Hotel Indalo adults only features an extensive garden, sun terrace and free Wi-Fi.
Really comfortable and private hotel for a great price in Puerto Viejo. We loved the size and layout of the room, the patio area and the pool was a nice bonus. It was close to everything but far enough that there was no traffic noise or music from the local clubs. Filtered water and coffee offered daily was great and the staff were friendly and helpful.
