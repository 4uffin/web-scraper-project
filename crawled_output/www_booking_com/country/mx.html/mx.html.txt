9.0
Wonderful
1,826 reviews
Located within a 19-minute walk of Fundidora Park and 2.1 miles of Macroplaza, Hotel Myst. Provides rooms with air conditioning and a private bathroom in Monterrey.
I really liked the bathroom. the mirror lit up from the sides. The shower was amazing! the shower head was straight on top of you and you could also sit because it had a bench. I liked the table that was put to eat. The breakfast service was actually really fast compared to the other reviews I saw. We ordered breakfast and in less than 15 minutes they brought it up to the room. The lady who brought the food up was very sweet. The TV was also very big. There was also an area were you could hang clothes if you needed to.
