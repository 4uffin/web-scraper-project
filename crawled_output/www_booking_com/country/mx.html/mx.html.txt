I've stayed in other hotels in Valle in the past, and sometimes I feel like I will freeze. Everything seems brand new. My partner and I felt like royalty.
There is a pool in the center and it was super beautiful the way it lights up the night.
There are 3 Padel courts which somehow blends into the scenery beautifully. Honestly, a complete package.
