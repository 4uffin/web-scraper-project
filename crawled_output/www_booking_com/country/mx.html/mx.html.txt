Hot and spicy tacos, sharp and salty margaritas, weird and wonderful art, or trumpet-blaring Mariachi – whatever springs to mind when you think of Mexico, it’s usually some form of unique sensory experience.
This vast country encompasses an endless variety of landscapes; from cacti-strewn deserts and steaming jungles, to shimmering coastlines and wildlife-rich biosphere reserves. And scattered among them are some of the most densely populated cities in the world.
In Baja California, Mexico’s northwestern beach-filled paradise, you could be kayaking through coves, swimming with whale sharks or surfing Pacific rollers. While in the southerly Yucatán Province, there are countless powdery-white beaches, archaeological wonders and idyllic cenotes (underwater caves) for snorkelling and diving.
For a taste of modern city life, there’s nowhere more compelling than Mexico City. Home to over 20 million people, the capital plays host to upscale shops, gourmet restaurants and a variety of museums. Discover the surreal artwork of two celebrated Mexicans at Museo Casa de Leon Trotsky and La Casa Azul, once home to Frida Kahlo. Alternatively, head to the likes of San Cristóbal de las Casas, in Chiapas, and Oaxaca City, in Oaxaca, to witness indigenous cultures that have maintained their traditions over the centuries.
And yet there’s so much more to this great country. Whether it’s speeding between the river walls of the colossal Sumidero Canyon, exploring the jaw-dropping jungle ruins of Palenque, riding the cross-country Copper Canyon Railway, hang-gliding in Valle de Bravo or climbing ancient pyramids left by the Mayans – Mexico will provide you with an unforgettable adventure.
You’ll find a wide range of accommodation in Mexico, including hotels, apartments, guesthouses and beachfront hostels. Only the most remote areas are without ample choice.
