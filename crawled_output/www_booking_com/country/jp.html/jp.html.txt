Its traditional culture, cuisine and ancient temples make it one of the most intriguing places in the world to visit.
Japan is famous for its sense of tranquility. As spring approaches, seas of cherry trees begin to blossom, colouring the nation a shade of pastel perfection. Combine this stunning sight with one a piece of history at Takeda Castle – its walls surrounded by thousands of the blush-hued flora. Intricate landscape gardens are another wonderfully serene sight, with the top three including Kairakuen in Mito, Kenrokuen in Kanazawa, and Korakuen in Okayama. If you’re feeling adventurous, Mount Fuji’s climbing season runs between July and August and offers out-of-this-world views from its summit at 3,776 m.
As you stroll though one of Japan’s vibrant cities, millions of brilliant neon lights create a dreamlike glow over the sleepless streets below. Non-stop capital Tokyo is a core of culture, with wildly diverse districts ranging from the serene shines of Chiyoda to the youthful energy of Shibuya. If you have time, pay a visit to the former capital Kyoto, famed for its ancient temples and gardens. Japan’s third-largest city, Osaka, is a hotspot for traditional food and a great place to try out delicious sushi, Okonomiyaki (fried cabbage cakes) and takoyaki (fried octopus dumplings).
To immerse yourself in the Japanese culture, try staying in a typical ryokan or capsule hotel. A huge number of hotels, apartments and guest houses are also available throughout the country.Top picks for hotels in JapanTry one of these popular and highly-rated Japan hotelsSee allWander Kyoto NanajoHotel in KyotoScored out of 10, guest rating 9.09.0Superb - What previous guests thought, 4,507 reviews Superb · 4,507 reviewsAttractively located in the Shimogyo Ward district of Kyoto, Wander Kyoto Nanajo is situated less than 1 km from TKP Garden City Kyoto, 1.8 km from Gion Shijo Station and 1.1 km from Kyoto Station.Show moreFrom £92 per nightShiba Park HotelHotel in TokyoScored out of 10, guest rating 9.09.0Superb - What previous guests thought, 3,066 reviews Superb · 3,066 reviewsShiba Park Hotel is just a 2-minute walk from Onarimon Subway Station and a 4-minute walk from Daimon Subway Station.Show moreFrom £181 per nightThe Gate Hotel Kyoto Takasegawa by HulicHotel in KyotoScored out of 10, guest rating 9.29.2Superb - What previous guests thought, 4,164 reviews Superb · 4,164 reviewsThe Gate Hotel Kyoto Takasegawa by Hulic features a restaurant, fitness centre, a bar and shared lounge in Kyoto.Show moreFrom £220 per nightHotel GrandConsort NahaHotel in NahaScored out of 10, guest rating 9.09.0Superb - What previous guests thought, 2,904 reviews Superb · 2,904 reviewsWell set in the centre of Naha, Hotel GrandConsort Naha is within 1.5 km of Naminoue Beach and 4.2 km of Tamaudun Mausoleum.Show moreFrom £88 per nightZen Kyoto Apartment HotelHotel in KyotoScored out of 10, guest rating 9.09.0Superb - What previous guests thought, 1,855 reviews Superb · 1,855 reviewsSet just 2.5 km from Fushimi Inari Taisha Shrine, Zen Kyoto Apartment Hotel features accommodation in Kyoto with access to a terrace, a bar, as well as a concierge service.Show moreFrom £74 per nightOyado Koto No YumeHotel in TakayamaScored out of 10, guest rating 9.19.1Superb - What previous guests thought, 2,871 reviews Superb · 2,871 reviewsJust a 2-minute walk from Takayama Station, Oyado Koto No Yume offers Japanese-style rooms with a colourful touch.Show moreFrom £166 per nightOstay Vermillion NambaHotel in OsakaScored out of 10, guest rating 9.09.0Superb - What previous guests thought, 3,951 reviews Superb · 3,951 reviewsSituated 500 metres from Liberty Osaka Museum, Vermillion features accommodation with a garden, a terrace and a shared kitchen for your convenience.

It starts with the welcome, which is not only a drink, but a pleasant talk with Rika, who runs the facility. And she helps you with everything, whether it's tips on events in the area, hints to places to explore, or shopping tips. If you are into cycling, her husband will help you organizing that.
