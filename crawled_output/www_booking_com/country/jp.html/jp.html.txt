Hotel Metropolitan Tokyo Haneda
Hotel in Ota Ward, Tokyo
9.1
Wonderful
4,608 reviews
Featuring 4-star accommodations, Hotel Metropolitan Tokyo Haneda - 2023-10-17 Grand Opening is located in Tokyo, 2.1 mi from Miwa Itsukushima Shrine and 2.3 mi from Omori Hachiman Shrine.
Being an aviation person, I loved the aviation theme of this modern hotel. It was easy to reach from Haneda airport, being just one stop along the underground metro routes heading to Tokyo. This hotel doesn't have a advertised shuttle bus although I did notice during our stay that a small 12 seater goes off every 30 minutes, on a first come, first served basis. This is no problem, as the metro station is right by the hotel.
They weren't the biggest rooms, but they were clean and to the point and we also got the airport view that we requested. The buffet breakfast offered up a good selection of food, even for a vegetarian like me. I also loved the rooftop terrace although it was closed one day due to high winds and rain. Great views of the city and airport from up there.
