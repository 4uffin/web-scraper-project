Sotetsu Hotels The Splaisir Yokohama
Hotel in Yokohama
9.1
Wonderful
1,104 reviews
Located in Yokohama and with Yokohama Marine Tower reachable within 3.7 miles, Sotetsu Hotels The Splaisir Yokohama provides a fitness center, non-smoking rooms, free WiFi throughout the property and...
If you’re looking to explore Yokohama or take day trips into Tokyo, this is the most convenient location you can find. It is located just outside of Yokohama Station, and is surrounded by hundreds of amazing restaurants, large malls, grocery and drugstores.
The hotel itself is very new, modern, and clean. There is a gym, self service luggage room, and self check-in/out. We stayed in the residential double room, and it was the perfect choice for longer stays as there is a well-equipped kitchenette (utensils, pots/pans, stovetop, rice cooker, fridge/freezer, etc) and laundry wash/dryer with detergent in the room. The rooms are beautifully designed with calming light wood tones, with high end furnishings including a Toto Neorest toilet! There was ample closet and storage space, as well as space to relax and place out luggage. This may be one of the best rooms we’ve stayed in, and we have been to 20+ hotels in Japan. Cleaning staff did an excellent job keeping the rooms spotless and tidy, and reception staff were efficient and polite.
Thank you very much for a wonderful stay in Yokohama! We hope to be back again!

New, clean, and beautifully appointed rooms. Onsen and lounge on the top level with unlimited popsicles were superb. The tatami mats throughout and only socked feet allowed in the entire hotel added to the experience. Car park next door was convenient. Right next to busy streets full of restaurants.
