Glico Man Sign is a 4-minute walk from the property. Guest reviewOur overall experience was great. The drink/eating lounge that's open until 12 midnight was really great, convenient and you can just bring your take-outs and eat it there. 7/11 is just a block away. Dotonbori is a 5-minute walk. The bus station from Kansai airport is a 10 minute walk. It's right next to the subway (Namba station). The underground is full of shops and restaurants. The beds were the most comfortable bed we had in all our travels overseas. The staff was really helpful with everything. They even gave us a ride to the bus station (OCAT) and carried our luggages and stroller inside and helped with buying of the tickets. It could taken us 30 minutes just to figure out where to go take the bus since we have 2 little ones. We really thanked them for that. For guests with babies, they have strollers you can borrow too! We will definitely book again next time we visit Osaka.Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.69.6Exceptional - What previous guests thought, 1,130 reviews Exceptional · 1,130 reviewsFrom $306 per nightThe Okura TokyoHotel in Minato, TokyoComposed of 2 buildings, The Okura Tokyo features a garden and bar.
