Guest reviewEverything was exceptional!
Driving to this place made us a little apprehensive, but after parking, the warm
inviting ochre stucco walls and noren entry allayed all concerns.
This a consumate Japanese fusion experience.
Everything from the engaging reception to the artfully refurbished room and personal hinoki bath meant pure relaxation.
Then there was the dinner which unfolded like a traditional Kaiseki meal, but contained the most inventive and delicious dishes.

TOOTHBRUSHES BIGGER THAN AVERAGE TOOTHBRUSH! I'm 6 feet 2 inches so they gave me a larger bathrobe, or maybe it was called yukata. It was our honeymoon and they treated us so well. They also had a lot of other free amenities in the restroom that I can't think of, but I know my wife took all of it. I can't remember if I added breakfast or if it was included, but it was worth it. Super delicious Japanese meal that made us both very full to start our day.

Glico Man Sign is a 4-minute walk from the property. Guest reviewOur overall experience was great. The drink/eating lounge that's open until 12 midnight was really great, convenient and you can just bring your take-outs and eat it there. 7/11 is just a block away. Dotonbori is a 5-minute walk. The bus station from Kansai airport is a 10 minute walk. It's right next to the subway (Namba station). The underground is full of shops and restaurants. The beds were the most comfortable bed we had in all our travels overseas. The staff was really helpful with everything. They even gave us a ride to the bus station (OCAT) and carried our luggages and stroller inside and helped with buying of the tickets. It could taken us 30 minutes just to figure out where to go take the bus since we have 2 little ones. We really thanked them for that. For guests with babies, they have strollers you can borrow too! We will definitely book again next time we visit Osaka.Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.69.6Exceptional - What previous guests thought, 1,129 reviews Exceptional · 1,129 reviewsFrom $247 per nightHotel MusoHotel in Shimogyo Ward, KyotoWell located in the center of Kyoto, Hotel Muso provides 3-star accommodations close to Gion Shijo Station and Kyoto Shigaku Kaikan Conference Hall.
