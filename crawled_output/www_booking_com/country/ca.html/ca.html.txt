Explore and find hotels in Canada
Canada is renowned for its endless variety of landscapes. Soaring mountains, lush pine forests and windswept beaches are all here, spread across seven regions. You might be tempted to head straight to the wilderness, but consider seeing the sights Toronto and other great cities have to offer before you do. There’s the skyscraping CN Tower in the capital, the beautiful botanical gardens of Montreal, and Vancouver’s Stanley Park makes for an unforgettable stroll in spring or summer. Bordering the USA, there’s Niagara Falls, the roaring crossroads of waterfalls that Canada is so well known for. Further north, Banff National Park promises a world of adventure, no matter the season. Come in summer and be rewarded with picturesque views of emerald lakes backed by glinting glaciers, and sightings of grizzly bears, wolves and moose roaming through the forest. Or choose winter, when the snow-covered Rockies become an adventure playground. You can stay in Banff, where there is a choice of three ski resorts, or head down to Whistler, the country’s prime resort, famed for its staggering peak-to-peak gondola. Alternatively, surf the swells of Nova Scotia or wander the stunning fortifications of Old Québec – there’s always an adventure waiting around every corner. Homely apartments and cozy lodges are available to rent throughout the country, but you'll also find a good choice of luxury hotels and budget-friendly hostels.
