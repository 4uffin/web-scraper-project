Stayed for 3d2n, The number one hotel I’ve stayed at in Canada. I’ve been here in Canada for 2 years, and there are only a few good hotels I’ve stayed at. The facility is new, the environment is clean, and the amenities are complete. The shampoo, conditioner, and soap smell so good! Their front office is available 24/7, always ready to assist guests anytime. The hot pool is beautiful. They also have us free bus passes. very convenient! The only downside is that the room I got didn’t have a mountain view, but our stay was still perfect for me regardless of the view. I didn’t request a mountain view, but maybe next time if we stay longer.
