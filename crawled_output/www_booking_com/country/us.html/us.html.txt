Hyatt Place Virginia Beach Oceanfront
Hotel in Virginia Beach Boardwalk, Virginia Beach
9.1
Wonderful
1,580 reviews
Located in Virginia Beach, a 1-minute walk from Viginia Beach, Hyatt Place Virginia Beach Oceanfront provides accommodations with a seasonal outdoor swimming pool, private parking, a fitness center...
The hotel is brand new, probably the newest at the Oceanfront in VB.
The room was spotless and spacious, with a modern decoration, functional furniture, a comfy bed, and an outstanding sea view.
The breakfast is simple, but enough.
The hotel has an extremely professional team. At the restaurant, we were nicely supported by Luis Tenorio and at the front desk by Dave.
We'll definitely stay there again.
