From the Statue of Liberty to the Grand Canyon, there’s a familiarity borne from endless films and TV shows and her role as a world superpower. Her sheer size means there's a sublime cocktail of sights, sounds and cultures to explore. America may be a relatively young nation but it sure knows how to build cities that are unforgettable. On the East Coast, glance up at the iconic skyscrapers of New York and chow down on lobster in Boston. On the West Coast, stroll San Francisco's crazy, twisty streets and visit the real La La land of Los Angeles. While inland, roll the dice in glittering Las Vegas. You'll find a different America at each world-famous city. Then there's the breathtaking, epic vistas. Countless. There's a reason why road trips hold such appeal. Head north to draw breath at Alaska's wilderness and majestic peaks of the Rockies, hike the glories of its famed national parks Yosemite and Yellowstone, look up at the towering rainforests of the Pacific Northwest, take in the sublime countryside of New England on the East Coast... just a few of its natural wonders. And with so many hotels here, from popular chains to world-class accommodation, cheap motels to beach resorts, you'll always find the right accommodation for you.Top picks for hotels in the United StatesTry one of these popular and highly-rated United States hotelsSee allAmeniti Bay - Best Western Signature CollectionHotel in SarasotaScored out of 10, guest rating 9.09.0Superb - What previous guests thought, 1,962 reviews Superb · 1,962 reviewsSet in Sarasota, 15 km from The John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art, Ameniti Bay - Best Western Signature Collection offers air-conditioned rooms and an outdoor swimming pool.Show moreFrom £103 per nightFontainebleau Las VegasHotel in Las VegasScored out of 10, guest rating 9.09.0Superb - What previous guests thought, 2,539 reviews Superb · 2,539 reviewsBoasting an outdoor swimming pool, a restaurant as well as a bar, Fontainebleau Las Vegas is situated in the centre of Las Vegas, 1.3 km from Las Vegas Convention Center.Show moreFrom £268 per nightThe Metric - Los Angeles DowntownHotel in Los AngelesScored out of 10, guest rating 9.09.0Superb - What previous guests thought, 1,052 reviews Superb · 1,052 reviewsSituated in the centre of Los Angeles, The Metric - Los Angeles Downtown is located 2.5 km from Microsoft Theater and 2.6 km from Crypto.com Arena.Show moreFrom £136 per nightKompose Boutique Resort @ Theme ParksHotel in OrlandoScored out of 10, guest rating 9.39.3Superb - What previous guests thought, 1,096 reviews Superb · 1,096 reviewsSituated in Orlando, 6.1 km from Disney's Animal Kingdom, Kompose Boutique Resort @ Theme Parks features accommodation with an outdoor swimming pool, private parking, a fitness centre and a bar.Show moreFrom £113 per nightUnder Canvas Grand CanyonHotel in ValleScored out of 10, guest rating 9.09.0Superb - What previous guests thought, 1,086 reviews Superb · 1,086 reviewsUnder Canvas Grand Canyon
