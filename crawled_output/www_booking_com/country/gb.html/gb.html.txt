room2 Belfast Hometel
Hotel in Belfast
9.3
Wonderful
4,081 reviews
Located a 16-minute walk from The Belfast Empire Music Hall, room2 Belfast Hometel offers 4-star accommodations in Belfast and features a shared lounge, a restaurant and a bar.
This has to be the best hotel I've ever stayed! I was impressed from the first step inside; The lobby is magnificent, everything is carefully decorated giving you an oasis inside the city center. Staff was highly attentive and, what's more important, seemed happy to work there! The room was spectacular, it had everything we could need while being absolutely stunning. Heating worked perfectly, the TV was easily adjustable and, my god, there were outlets near the bed!! That's so rare in Europe!
The bed was perfect, the room was soundproof (although people closing doors loudly is always a problem in hotels).
The hotel also sells things for you to cook in your room. This in addition to cocktails being sold until pretty late. Great bar!
Oh, and the checkout time! Why can't all hotels all have the same schedules!! We had to leave early anyway, but being able to leave al 2pm is precious.
TLDR: This hotel was the best part of my stay in Belfast, I could have stayed forever. In all honesty, I will prefer them in every city they are in, now and in the future.
Plus: Highly recycling conscious!

Attractively set in Glasgow, The Social Hub Glasgow has air-conditioned rooms, a fitness center, free WiFi and a terrace.
I spent three weeks at this hotel, and I can confidently say it's one of the best accommodations I've ever experienced! From the moment I checked in, the hospitality was exceptional. My room was impeccably clean, spacious, and flooded with natural light, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. The delightful view from the window added an extra touch of charm, making it a perfect place to unwind.
I particularly appreciated the well-equipped kitchen; all the necessary cooking utensils were readily available, allowing me to prepare meals with ease. One of the standout features was the smart TV, which provided fantastic entertainment options. Connecting to Netflix and YouTube was seamless, making evenings in my room enjoyable and relaxing.
Additionally, the quality of the coffee provided in the room was outstanding—definitely a highlight of my mornings! Overall, my stay exceeded all expectations, and I can't recommend this hotel highly enough for anyone looking for comfort, convenience, and a touch of luxury. I’m already looking forward to my next visit!

Perfect stay! The location is excellent, very close to interesting tourist attractions and a bus stop, which made it super convenient to get around.
The room was outstanding — clean, complete, and extremely comfortable. The hotel staff were all very polite, welcoming, and always ready to help.
Another great highlight is that the hotel has partnerships with local restaurants, offering nice discounts for guests. We couldn’t have asked for a better experience and would definitely come back!
