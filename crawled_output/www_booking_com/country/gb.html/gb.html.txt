Guest reviewEverything. I really have no words to describe the perfection of the Old Stables room (loft? Mini-apartment?) I would happily live there forever. The room was huge, beautifully decorated in a fabulous equestrian motif (the Farrier is at the original blacksmith shop), sparkling clean, and too many amenities to list. The food is delicious and plentiful. We had the full English breakfast and it set us up for the whole day! Everyone on staff were really lovely and so kind. I wish we could’ve stayed for more than one night!Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.69.6Exceptional - What previous guests thought, 383 reviews Exceptional · 383 reviewsFrom $256 per nightHive TownhouseHotel in AberaeronLocated in Aberaeron, Hive Townhouse has a fitness center, restaurant, bar, and free WiFi throughout the property.

Guest reviewEverything was excellent, fitted us in at last minute for dinner. An excellent relaxed atmosphere. A wee bonus fresh milk in a tiny fridge for our coffee and tea in the room. Second stay on my way back from down south and will be my stopping off point for future trips to south of England.

Guest reviewA beautifully presented family-run B & B that gives you all the privacy you want or engagement with other travelers in the well-appointed common areas.
Funnily enough, they get quite a few bookings and then cancellations from Australian travelers who mistakenly think they were booking for Torquay, Victoria, Australia rather than on the Devon Coast, UK.
The family is delightful with dad being an excellent chef (breakfast eggs benedict was cooked perfectly), mum was so hospitable with great directions and suggestions with our walk to the harbor front and dinner, and the daughter who looked after us with checking in and at breakfast was just a breath of fresh air (good luck with your uni studies).
I would definitely stay there again but this time for a few more days so we could take advantage of that inviting-looking swimming pool.Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.79.7Exceptional - What previous guests thought, 377 reviews Exceptional · 377 reviewsFrom $177 per nightThe ShoregateHotel in CrailFeaturing a bar, The Shoregate is located in Crail in the Fife region, 7.3 miles from Fairmont St Andrews Bay Golf Course and 10 miles from St Andrews University. Guest reviewI was greeted by the staff with the warmest of welcomes. I was shown to my room, where everything I needed to know was explained to me. I hadn't made plans for dinner, but the concierge immediately got me a table at the restaurant, where I had a delicious meal with extremely attentive (but not overly so) service. Perfect location in the heart of Crail, with plenty of parking nearby.Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.79.7Exceptional - What previous guests thought, 82 reviews Exceptional · 82 reviewsFrom $297 per nightRoch CastleHotel in RochDating back to the 12th century, Roch Castle offers guest accommodations, set on a rocky outcrop over looking St Brides Bay.

Guest reviewThe Udny Arms Hotel was amazing! The rooms were updated, clean, and comfortable. The bathroom in the room was extremely spacious and taking a shower felt like visiting a spa. Our group of three really appreciated that they offer single rooms with 3 nice beds. We had the most comfortable nights sleep in our crazy busy travel week through the UK while staying here. Everything exceeded expectations! The front desk worker and bartender who checked us into our room was very nice and helpful. He even gave us great ideas on things to see and places to visit in the area and gave us an entire history of Newburgh and Aberdeen-Shire. From free treats made by the local bakery in our room when we arrived to the unplanned adventures prompted by staff recommendations, we all left Udny Arms sincerely wishing we could have stayed more than one night!Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.59.5Exceptional - What previous guests thought, 90 reviews Exceptional · 90 reviewsFrom $221 per nightMost booked hotels in the United Kingdom in the past monthSee allZedwell Capsule Hotel Piccadilly CircusHotel in Westminster Borough, LondonPopular with guests booking hotels in LondonScored out of 10, guest rating 7.87.8Good - What previous guests thought, 1,965 reviews Good · 1,965 reviewsZedwell Hotel Piccadilly CircusHotel in Westminster Borough, LondonPopular with guests booking hotels in LondonScored out of 10, guest rating 7.87.8Good - What previous guests thought, 40,747 reviews Good · 40,747 reviewsSofitel London GatwickHotel in HorleyPopular with guests booking hotels in HorleyScored out of 10, guest rating 8.68.6Excellent - What previous guests thought, 22,513 reviews Excellent · 22,513 reviewsMotel One GlasgowHotel in Central Glasgow, GlasgowPopular with guests booking hotels in GlasgowScored out of 10, guest rating 8.78.7Excellent - What previous guests thought, 23,237 reviews Excellent · 23,237 reviewsMotel One Manchester-Royal ExchangeHotel in ManchesterPopular with guests booking hotels in ManchesterScored out of 10, guest rating 8.68.6Excellent - What previous guests thought, 18,036 reviews Excellent · 18,036 reviewsMotel One Manchester-PiccadillyHotel in ManchesterPopular with guests booking hotels in ManchesterScored out of 10, guest rating 8.78.7Excellent - What previous guests thought, 19,739 reviews Excellent · 19,739 reviewsMotel One Manchester-St. Peter´s SquareHotel in ManchesterPopular with guests booking hotels in ManchesterScored out of 10, guest rating 8.98.9Excellent - What previous guests thought, 18,119 reviews Excellent · 18,119 reviewsRoyal National HotelHotel in Camden, LondonPopular with guests booking hotels in LondonScored out of 10, guest rating 7.87.8Good - What previous guests thought, 16,211 reviews Good · 16,211 reviewsTavistock HotelHotel in Camden, LondonPopular with guests booking hotels in LondonScored out of 10, guest rating 8.18.1Very Good - What previous guests thought, 10,389 reviews Very Good · 10,389 reviewsibis budget Manchester Airport T2Hotel in HalePopular with guests booking hotels in HaleScored out of 10, guest rating 7.77.7Good - What previous guests thought, 23,098 reviews Good · 23,098 reviewsFly to the most popular airportsLondon Heathrow Airport (LHR)London, United KingdomLondon Gatwick Airport (LGW)London, United KingdomManchester Airport (MAN)Manchester, United KingdomLondon Stansted Airport (STN)London, United KingdomBirmingham Airport (BHX)Birmingham, United KingdomEdinburgh Airport (EDI)Edinburgh, United KingdomLondon Luton Airport (LTN)London, United KingdomBristol Airport (BRS)Bristol, United KingdomGlasgow Airport (GLA)Glasgow, United KingdomAberdeen Airport (ABZ)Aberdeen, United KingdomLondon City Airport (LCY)London, United KingdomLiverpool John Lennon Airport (LPL)Liverpool, United KingdomResearch, refine, and make plans for your whole tripAll hotelsWhether you're going to the United Kingdom, elsewhere in Europe, or any other corner of the world, you'll find the perfect hotel on Booking.com.Cheap hotels in the United KingdomExplore more great accommodation options for your trip.B&Bs in the United KingdomExplore more great accommodation options for your trip.Flights from New York to LondonFind and compare prices for popular flight routes.Flights from New York to ManchesterFind and compare prices for popular flight routes.Hotels in IrelandExtend your trip or start planning your next adventure.Car rental near London Heathrow AirportFlying in to London Heathrow Airport and need to rent a car?
