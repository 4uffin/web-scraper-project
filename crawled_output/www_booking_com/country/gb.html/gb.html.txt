London, the capital, is the obvious draw. It’s got the hitlist of the country’s most famous attractions – Big Ben, Buckingham Palace, Houses of Parliament – yet it's much more than just history and landmarks. London brims with urban sophistication and attitude. Contemporary trends and innovation is everywhere -
chow down at hip eateries, see cutting-edge architecture (the Shard) and widen your horizons with its diverse cultural scene. Go beyond London and you'll find the ancient jostling alongside the modern. In England, time travel to centuries-old cities –Oxford and Bath – and quaint villages, immerse yourself at regal palaces and historic cathedrals. While northern cities such as Liverpool and Manchester blast you with their on-trend vibes and character. And then there's the scenery. Draw breath at the majestic mountains and lochs in Scotland, gaze in awe at nature's art at the Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland, hike the sublime Welsh countryside and coastline. Britain's diversity also lies in its hospitality. Reside in the world's finest, swankiest hotels in the world, be hip at a boutique hotel, nestle in a cozy cottage or B&B, the choice is yours.Top picks for hotels in the United KingdomTry one of these popular and highly-rated United Kingdom hotelsSee allSerenity Apartments BradfordHotel in BradfordScored out of 10, guest rating 9.59.5Exceptional - What previous guests thought, 1,454 reviews Exceptional · 1,454 reviewsBoasting a spa bath, Serenity Apartments Bradford is situated in Bradford.

Guest reviewWe honestly couldn’t have asked for more! The staff were so wonderfully friendly and welcoming, it felt like home from the moment we arrived. The farm-to-table ethos meant the food was absolutely delicious, and the kids had the best time with all the activities (farm
tours, meeting baby lambs, feeding pigs, horse riding, swimming and mini land rover rides), and we’ve made the loveliest family memories walking through the grounds every evening. Being only a short drive (10 mins) from the coast was the cherry on top.
