Aga was exceedingly helpful, from checking us into our room to serving us at the restaurant. We have never stayed at a place that was so giving with its ammenities. The room had a bountiful mini-bar and the breakfast was superb.
The room itself was immaculately clean and well-appointed. It was obvious it was designed with travelers in mind. We especially appreciated the convenient outlets and light switches located on each side of the best. The bathroom was clean, towels luxurious, and bed comfortable.
Free parking is available at a public lot a block away from the townhouses.

Guest reviewA beautifully presented family-run B & B that gives you all the privacy you want or engagement with other travelers in the well-appointed common areas.
Funnily enough, they get quite a few bookings and then cancellations from Australian travelers who mistakenly think they were booking for Torquay, Victoria, Australia rather than on the Devon Coast, UK.
The family is delightful with dad being an excellent chef (breakfast eggs benedict was cooked perfectly), mum was so hospitable with great directions and suggestions with our walk to the harbor front and dinner, and the daughter who looked after us with checking in and at breakfast was just a breath of fresh air (good luck with your uni studies).
I would definitely stay there again but this time for a few more days so we could take advantage of that inviting-looking swimming pool.Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.79.7Exceptional - What previous guests thought, 376 reviews Exceptional · 376 reviewsFrom $177 per nightCromlixHotel in KinbuckCromlix is owned by Kim and Andy Murray.
