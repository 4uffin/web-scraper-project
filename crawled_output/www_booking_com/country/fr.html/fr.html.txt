From the châteaux of the Loire Valley to the legendary Latin Quarter of Paris and the ski resorts of the French Alps, each region offers a new discovery. Home to the Louvre, the Eiffel Tower and the iconic cathedral of Notre-Dame, it's easy to see why Paris pulls in over two million tourists a year. Each of the capital's districts (known as arrondissements) have their own unique vibe. Stroll through Le Marais and you'll experience a medieval labyrinth of crooked lanes filled with quirky shops and old-school bakers. Venture into the seventh arrondissement and you'll be in the heart of the action, with some of the city's best museums on show. If you fancy a jaunt north, you'll find Lille with its noticeably Belgian influences, the Champagne wine region and the pretty cities of Normandy. Famed for its tropical subclimate, the south shows off France's glamourous side, with the Côte d’Azur home to super-snazzy St-Tropez, Cannes and Nice. Depending on which part of the country you're visiting, you'll find accommodation to suit your needs. Whether its an extravagant five-star hotel in Paris, a ski lodge in Chamonix or a campsite in Brittany, you'll find the perfect stay. Top tip: Hôtel de Ville is French for 'town hall' so don't be confused when they don't offer you a room for the night!Top picks for hotels in FranceTry one of these popular and highly-rated France hotelsSee allSelect HotelHotel in ParisScored out of 10, guest rating 9.19.1Superb - What previous guests thought, 2,731 reviews Superb · 2,731 reviewsLocated in the heart of the Latin Quarter, in Paris’s lively 5th arrondissement is Select Hotel.

The hotel manager spoke flawless English and was ready to answer any requests we had, and to arrange dinner reservations for us. Everything in the place was of top quality. We were told that renovations had been done less than a year previously.
The manager greeted us personally upon arrival, gave us a tour of the key features of the house and grounds, and a brief history of the place. She then provided complimentary beverages to enjoy, followed by showing us our room and it's features.

Guest reviewThis is hands down the best hotel experience I’ve ever had, and I’ve stayed in many. It’s a little boutique hotel, and right from the moment we arrived, we felt completely looked after. As soon as the door opened, we were greeted with a big smile and welcomed by name, as if they’d been expecting us. They asked how our trip was going, how our holiday had been so far, helped us with our bags, and took our breakfast orders for the next morning.
Then they asked if we’d like a recommendation for dinner. We said yes, and not only did they give us an amazing suggestion, but they went ahead and made the booking for us too. They’re real foodies, and it showed.
The interior design throughout the hotel was absolutely beautiful, thoughtful, stylish, and full of character. Our room was lovely and peaceful, with top-quality linen and attention to every detail. I slept so well. Honestly, I’d come back to this town just to stay here again.Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.79.7Exceptional - What previous guests thought, 141 reviews Exceptional · 141 reviewsFrom £120 per nightMost booked hotels in France in the past monthSee allibis Paris CDG AirportHotel in Roissy-en-FrancePopular with guests booking hotels in Roissy-en-FranceScored out of 10, guest rating 7.77.7Good - What previous guests thought, 32,992 reviews Good · 32,992 reviewsHotelF1 Paris Saint Ouen Marché Aux PucesHotel in ParisPopular with guests booking hotels in ParisScored out of 10, guest rating 6.56.5Pleasant - What previous guests thought, 17,831 reviews Pleasant · 17,831 reviewsibis budget Paris Porte De MontmartreHotel in 18th arr., ParisPopular with guests booking hotels in ParisScored out of 10, guest rating 6.36.3Pleasant - What previous guests thought, 18,497 reviews Pleasant · 18,497 reviewsibis Styles Paris Charles de Gaulle AirportHotel in Roissy-en-FrancePopular with guests booking hotels in Roissy-en-FranceScored out of 10, guest rating 8.08.0Very good - What previous guests thought, 27,526 reviews Very good · 27,526 reviewsB&B HOTEL Paris Porte des LilasHotel in 19th arr., ParisPopular with guests booking hotels in ParisScored out of 10, guest rating 7.97.9Good - What previous guests thought, 12,849 reviews Good · 12,849 reviewsToyoko INN Marseille Saint CharlesHotel in Belle de Mai - Saint-Lazare, MarseillePopular with guests booking hotels in MarseilleScored out of 10, guest rating 7.87.8Good - What previous guests thought, 13,271 reviews Good · 13,271 reviewshotelF1 Paris Porte de ChâtillonHotel in 14th arr., ParisPopular with guests booking hotels in ParisScored out of 10, guest rating 7.67.6Good - What previous guests thought, 17,785 reviews Good · 17,785 reviewscitizenM Paris Charles de Gaulle AirportHotel in Roissy-en-FrancePopular with guests booking hotels in Roissy-en-FranceScored out of 10, guest rating 8.78.7Fabulous - What previous guests thought, 19,394 reviews Fabulous · 19,394 reviewsibis Paris Coeur d'Orly AirportHotel in OrlyPopular with guests booking hotels in OrlyScored out of 10, guest rating 7.87.8Good - What previous guests thought, 18,540 reviews Good · 18,540 reviewsMotel One Paris-Porte DoréeHotel in 12th arr., ParisPopular with guests booking hotels in ParisScored out of 10, guest rating 8.68.6Fabulous - What previous guests thought, 8,131 reviews Fabulous · 8,131 reviewsFly to the most popular airportsParis - Charles de Gaulle Airport (CDG)Paris, FranceParis - Orly Airport (ORY)Paris, FranceLyon - Saint Exupery Airport (LYS)Lyon, FranceToulouse-Blagnac Airport (TLS)Toulouse, FranceMérignac Airport (BOD)Bordeaux, FranceMarseille Provence Airport (MRS)Marseille, FranceNantes Atlantique Airport (NTE)Nantes, FranceNice Côte d'Azur Airport (NCE)Nice, FranceParis Beauvais-Tille Airport (BVA)Paris, FranceMontpellier - Mediterranee Airport (MPL)Montpellier, FranceStrasbourg International Airport (SXB)Strasbourg, FranceLille Airport (LIL)Lille, FranceResearch, refine and make plans for your whole tripCar hire near Paris - Charles de Gaulle AirportFlying in to Paris - Charles de Gaulle Airport and need to hire a car?
