Guest reviewThe staff is very warm and welcoming.
They served us drinks when we arrived in the morning to drop off our luggage before check-in.
They gave us a map with a route to follow of Montemartre with descriptions detailing all the points of interest to view.
This is a fantastic gesture and we immediately took on the adventure to explore!
The hotel is very beautifully decorated and they use L'Occitane products.
Our room had 2 free bottles of water and macarons for us to snack on.
The room was beautifully furnished as well and was very clean, including the bathroom.
The hotel serves free beverages along with madeleines to snack on from 3-10 pm, I believe.
Upon leaving, we were given a nice shoulder bag from the hotel as well as an Eiffel Tower keychain.
Very unexpected nice gifts and mementos from our overnight in Paris.Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.69.6Exceptional - What previous guests thought, 3,220 reviews Exceptional · 3,220 reviewsFrom $297 per nightMost booked hotels in France in the past monthSee allibis Paris CDG AirportHotel in Roissy-en-FrancePopular with guests booking hotels in Roissy-en-FranceScored out of 10, guest rating 7.77.7Good - What previous guests thought, 32,996 reviews Good · 32,996 reviewsHotelF1 Paris Saint Ouen Marché Aux PucesHotel in ParisPopular with guests booking hotels in ParisScored out of 10, guest rating 6.56.5Pleasant - What previous guests thought, 17,831 reviews Pleasant · 17,831 reviewsibis budget Paris Porte De MontmartreHotel in 18th arr., ParisPopular with guests booking hotels in ParisScored out of 10, guest rating 6.36.3Pleasant - What previous guests thought, 18,491 reviews Pleasant · 18,491 reviewsibis Styles Paris Charles de Gaulle AirportHotel in Roissy-en-FrancePopular with guests booking hotels in Roissy-en-FranceScored out of 10, guest rating 8.08.0Very Good - What previous guests thought, 27,523 reviews Very Good · 27,523 reviewsB&B HOTEL Paris Porte des LilasHotel in 19th arr., ParisPopular with guests booking hotels in ParisScored out of 10, guest rating 7.97.9Good - What previous guests thought, 12,849 reviews Good · 12,849 reviewsToyoko INN Marseille Saint CharlesHotel in Belle de Mai - Saint-Lazare, MarseillePopular with guests booking hotels in MarseilleScored out of 10, guest rating 7.87.8Good - What previous guests thought, 13,271 reviews Good · 13,271 reviewshotelF1 Paris Porte de ChâtillonHotel in 14th arr., ParisPopular with guests booking hotels in ParisScored out of 10, guest rating 7.67.6Good - What previous guests thought, 17,793 reviews Good · 17,793 reviewscitizenM Paris Charles de Gaulle AirportHotel in Roissy-en-FrancePopular with guests booking hotels in Roissy-en-FranceScored out of 10, guest rating 8.78.7Excellent - What previous guests thought, 19,385 reviews Excellent · 19,385 reviewsibis Paris Coeur d'Orly AirportHotel in OrlyPopular with guests booking hotels in OrlyScored out of 10, guest rating 7.87.8Good - What previous guests thought, 18,540 reviews Good · 18,540 reviewsMotel One Paris-Porte DoréeHotel in 12th arr., ParisPopular with guests booking hotels in ParisScored out of 10, guest rating 8.68.6Excellent - What previous guests thought, 8,123 reviews Excellent · 8,123 reviewsFly to the most popular airportsParis - Charles De Gaulle Airport (CDG)Paris, FranceParis - Orly Airport (ORY)Paris, FranceLyon - Saint Exupery Airport (LYS)Lyon, FranceToulouse-Blagnac Airport (TLS)Toulouse, FranceMérignac Airport (BOD)Bordeaux, FranceMarseille Provence Airport (MRS)Marseille, FranceNantes Atlantique Airport (NTE)Nantes, FranceNice Côte d'Azur Airport (NCE)Nice, FranceParis Beauvais-Tille Airport (BVA)Paris, FranceMontpellier - Mediterranee Airport (MPL)Montpellier, FranceStrasbourg International Airport (SXB)Strasbourg, FranceLille Airport (LIL)Lille, FranceResearch, refine, and make plans for your whole tripCar rental near Paris - Charles De Gaulle AirportFlying in to Paris - Charles De Gaulle Airport and need to rent a car?
