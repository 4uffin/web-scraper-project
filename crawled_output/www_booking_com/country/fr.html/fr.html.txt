Wonderful

Located in Troyes, a 6-minute walk from Espace Argence, La Licorne Hotel & Spa Troyes - MGallery Collection has accommodations with a fitness center, private parking, a terrace and a bar.
This hotel is ideally located to explore the centre of Troyes on foot, and there is sufficient parking space if you come by car. We would like to extend our special thanks to Sébastien, who helped us with everything and gave us the warmest welcome imaginable. Staff at reception and at the bar were also extremely professional. Our bedroom was not only very spacious but also very well-appointed, with a huge and very comfortable bed. We loved the bar (dim lighting, plenty of space between tables, an enormous selection of cocktails and other drinks), and the breakfast was very good too!
