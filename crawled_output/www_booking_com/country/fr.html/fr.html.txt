This hotel has a year-round outdoor pool and spa center. Guest reviewWhere do I begin? Pascal and his team have made our trip to Le Thor one we will never forget. What a great host and absolutely the prime location if you want to experience the countryside of France. The rooms are huge and cozy, they feel like royalty rooms. The breakfast included was amazing: fruits, yogurt, bread, etc. Definitely worth it to pay extra for the spa - it just adds so much to the overall experience. Lastly, Pascal made sure we had the best stay - we didn’t have a car so he helped arrange for our cabs and restaurants. We feel very nostalgic looking back at our stay. If there is an accommodation that has set a high standard for us - it is Les Carmes.
