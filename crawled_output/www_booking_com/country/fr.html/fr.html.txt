Laurie and Dorian provided personalized service that went above and beyond, making every moment unforgettable. The property itself is an enchanting old convent with a rich history dating back to the Hundred Years' War. Laurie dedicated more than a year to researching the story of the place, diving into historical archives to uncover its fascinating past, which she shared with us during our stay.
Perfectly located near the best towns in the region, Château Maraval is a haven of tranquility. The stars at night are breathtaking, and the serene forest brings deer right to your view as you enjoy breakfast. Laurie and Dorian truly made our anniversary unforgettable by filling the room with roses and helping us secure reservations at top spots.
Château Maraval is not just a stay; it’s an extraordinary experience of history, beauty, and unmatched hospitality.
