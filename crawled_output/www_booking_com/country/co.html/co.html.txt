Hotels 111
Hotel in San Andrés
9.2
Wonderful
1,043 reviews
Hotels 111 has accommodations with free WiFi in San Andrés, ideally set a 13-minute walk from North End and 0.6 miles from San Andres Bay.
I liked everything in the hotel, the employees were so attentive and helpful, I didn't count that they provided a staff to grab your baggage.
Besides they offered free water, free coffee and tea, the room was very clean and well smelling.
Basically nothing to complain about. The hotel was so good that sometimes we rather stay in the hotel than the city.

Refugio del Jaguar
Hotel in El Poblado, Medellín
9.3
Wonderful
1,300 reviews
Featuring a garden, Refugio del Jaguar is located in Medellín in the Antioquia region, a few steps from El Poblado Park and a 7-minute walk from Lleras Park.
Absolutely amazing hotel that's more like a boutique guesthouse. All the staff know you by name and they are so friendly.
The rooms are spotless and the rest of the hotel is super clean as well.
As soon as you check in they send you a load of recommendations by WhatsApp and we booked a day tour to Guatape through the hotel which was great. It was also half the price of Viator so if you are thinking of booking a tour get in touch with the hotel first!
Beds are very comfy and the only slight issue I had was that the pillows are very thin and there's only 2 on the bed. If there's any improvement that could be made it's to put extra pillows on the bed. They did give us 2 extra when we asked though so it was no issue. Rooms are also windowless which we knew about and the hotel is very forthcoming with that information but due to the fan on the wall and open shared space this wasn't really an issue as we only slept in the room.
