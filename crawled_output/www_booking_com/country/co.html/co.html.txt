Hotels 111
Hotel in San Andr√©s
9.2
Wonderful
1,042 reviews
Hotels 111 has accommodations with free WiFi in San Andr√©s, ideally set a 13-minute walk from North End and 0.6 miles from San Andres Bay.
Excellent hotel and extremely well located, 2-3 minutes from the beach.
The room was excellent and we were lucky enough to have a balcony.
A little overpriced, especially for not offering other services, but it makes up for it being an extremely pleasant and modern building.
The team is five stars.
It's worth it for the Nespresso coffee and for lending beach towels.
If I ever return to San Andr√©s, I will have no doubts in choosing this hotel.
I highly recommend it.

We loved this hotel, an older traditional style hotel very well
decorated and everything was functional.
The staff were excellent always very friendly and helpful. The lady on the frount desk along with the younger girl were extremely professional and kept everything in the hotel running beautifully.
The breakfast was excellent, they made the best huevos peiricos I've come across on my trip in Colombia üòã
A great location only minutes walk to the bus terminal and town centre. Lovely common areas where u could sit and relax in the hotel,
WiFi worked well and shower had good pressure üëç would definitely stay again.
