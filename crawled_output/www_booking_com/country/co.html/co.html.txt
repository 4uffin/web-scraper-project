Colombia’s landscapes are wonderfully varied, and packed full of adventure. Go hiking, biking or horse riding in the northerly ‘Coffee Triangle’, explore the ruins of Santa Marta’s Ciudad Perdida (‘The Lost City’), or try rock climbing and hang-gliding in the rugged Santander region just east of Medellín. Colombia’s third biggest city is known for its progressive vibe, picturesque parks and spectacular surroundings. As the capital, Bogotá is the definitive place to get a taste of Colombia’s culture. Take in the streets’ bright canvas of street art, murals and graffiti, or kick back in the Parkway area of La Soledad, where you’ll find live music, local art exhibitions and pop-up theatres. The far-flung islands of San Andres and Providencia spell aquatic paradise for snorkellers and scuba divers. Glide your way through vivid corals and schools of tropical fish, explore an eerie shipwreck off the southwest coast of San Andres, or stick to dry land and enjoy a salsa-fuelled culture through day and night. Elsewhere, Cartagena’s Old Town is alive with colour – picture lemon walls with sky-blue shutters and balconies overflowing with tropical plants. Colombia has a good variety of accommodation in the west and to the north, from stylish hotels to homely apartments and cozy posadas (guest houses). There are a few remote lodgings east of Bogotá.Top picks for hotels in ColombiaTry one of these popular and highly-rated Colombia hotelsSee allThe Boato HotelHotel in GuatapéScored out of 10, guest rating 9.19.1Superb - What previous guests thought, 1,198 reviews Superb · 1,198 reviewsSet in Guatapé, 5.1 km from Piedra del Peñol, The Boato Hotel offers accommodation with a garden, free private parking, a private beach area and a terrace.Show moreFrom £118 per nightEcoHub Hotel MedellinHotel in MedellínScored out of 10, guest rating 9.09.0Superb - What previous guests thought, 1,642 reviews Superb · 1,642 reviewsSituated in Medellín, 1.4 km from El Poblado Park, EcoHub Hotel Medellin features accommodation with a fitness centre, free private parking, a terrace and a restaurant.Show moreFrom £69 per nightPalermo Home Bogota & Art GalleryHotel in BogotáScored out of 10, guest rating 9.19.1Superb - What previous guests thought, 1,641 reviews Superb · 1,641 reviewsLocated 1.9 km from El Campin Stadium, Palermo Home Bogota & Art Gallery offers 3-star accommodation in Bogotá and features a bar.Show moreFrom £31 per nightPlaya del Ritmo Beach Hostel & Bar - Adults OnlyHotel in Santa MartaScored out of 10, guest rating 9.09.0Superb - What previous guests thought, 1,122 reviews Superb · 1,122 reviewsBoasting a beachfront location, Playa del Ritmo Beach Hostel &Bar offers free Wi-Fi and 24-hour front desk assistance in Pozos Colorados beach, Santa Marta.
