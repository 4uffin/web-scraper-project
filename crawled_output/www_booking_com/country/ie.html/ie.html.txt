This charming cluster of counties embodies a troop of historic cities, coastal and countryside scenery, and an endless stream of friendly culture which have made it one of the most popular places on earth.
Irelandâ€™s cities each offer their own unique charisma. As the capital city, Dublin doesnâ€™t disappoint; offering a wealth of nightlife spots and landmarks such as the beautiful Trinity College. Famous for its pubs, Dublin is home to over 1,000 of them, with most offering traditional live music and draught Guinness fresh from the nearby Storehouse. Cultural must-sees include the old library and Book of Kells at Trinity College and a visit to the many museums scattered throughout town. The country is also famous for its postcard-perfect countryside, with scenic strolls guaranteed in the counties of Cork and Kerry, or the Connemara coastline in Galway. Castle enthusiasts should make a beeline for the Shannon Region, which also features the astonishing Cliffs of Moher.
Dublin offers a huge variety of city centre hotels and B&Bs, as well as apartments, hostels and more. Head towards the countryside and youâ€™ll find romantic cottages, country houses and even farm stays.

Guest reviewI spent three incredible days at Corrib Lodge with my wife, and as a fishing enthusiast, I couldnâ€™t have asked for a better experience. The Lodge is located right on the lake, with private access, and the views are absolutely stunning , but what really makes the difference is the fishing.
This place is run by an Italian owner whoâ€™s not only a great chef but also a passionate and knowledgeable guide. Every day we went out on the lake with him, fully equipped with top-notch gear, exploring hidden spots, landing great catches, and hearing fascinating stories about the lakeâ€™s history. We even stopped on remote islands and visited old castles along the way.
They also organize deep-sea fishing trips for those who want to explore the ocean, a great option Iâ€™ll definitely try next time.
The whole team is friendly and professional, and the atmosphere is relaxed but well-run.
If you love fishing and want something truly special, Corrib Lodge is the place. Iâ€™ll be back for sure.Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.89.8Exceptional - What previous guests thought, 24 reviews ExceptionalÂ Â·Â 24 reviewsFrom Â£170 per nightLoch Lein Country HouseHotel in KillarneyThis friendly and relaxed hotel has superb views over Killarney's Lower Lake and MacGillicuddy Reeks.
