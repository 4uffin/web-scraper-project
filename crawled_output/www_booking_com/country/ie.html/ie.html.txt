The owners and staff strive for perfection and it shows: Rooms are spacious, spotless clean, well furnished and with a large window facing a beautiful field and lake. It was like waking up into an impressionist painting.
Breakfast was wonderful, with a good number of choices.
Owners are extremely helpful: We checked-in late after a long drive, when both the hotel restaurant and all restaurants in the area were closed. They sent us a platter of salmon sandwiches, and didn't even charge us for it.
Dinner in restaurant is highly recommended.Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.69.6Exceptional - What previous guests thought, 750 reviews Exceptional · 750 reviewsFrom $259 per nightSt Kyrans Guest HouseHotel in VirginiaLocated in Virginia, 10 miles from Loughcrew Historical Gardens & Visitor Center, St Kyrans Guest House has accommodations with a garden, free private parking, a shared lounge and a terrace.
