Wonderful
1,893 reviews
The Bedford Townhouse is a boutique property set in the heart of Limerick. Among the various facilities are a gym and a roof garden. Free WiFi is available and The Hunt Museum is 1640 feet away.
What an enormously friendly staff! They were so welcoming, helped us with all questions we had(special thanks for fixing the tv!) and we had the warmest check-in and check-out. In most hotels the check-out is merely a formal goodbye, but in this case the lady was so kind. Lovely breakfast with fresh ingredients. Very large beds, big rooms, impeccably clean. Loved the lounge downstairs for coffee and some chat. Nice neighbourhood with restaurants and shops, perfect location. Great information and guidelines from the hotel. We truly recommend!
