This is our third visit to the hotel, it always meets our expectations. On this occasion we used it as a stop over before flying back to the U.K. I had a relaxing day by the pool and my partner had a 2 hour massage as well as a relax by the pool. We only had one meal that was dinner the night we arrived, food was excellent.

Located in Bangkok, 2.2 miles from MBK Shopping Mall, Grande Centre Point Surawong Bangkok provides accommodations with an outdoor swimming pool, free private parking, a fitness center and a terrace.
Incredible facilities, everything was modern, spotless and luxurious. The Executive Suite room, with the large hot tub and city view, was well worth the upgrade. The rooftop restaurant Bangrak Grill was outstanding and reasonably priced. The token system was also very interesting, wish more hotels would follow this example. Loved the Spa that was open until midnight.
