Wonderful

Located in Bangkok, within 3 miles of Wat Arun and 3.1 miles of Wat Pho, River Home Bangkok has a terrace.
Staff is super friendly with 24 hour tea/coffee service. They kept my luggage x 10 days for no fee. The property is super clean.
I lost my phone at 5am and they helped me get a cab to go find it and I slept through my alarms and they helped me find a ride to the airport when taxis weren’t accepting new riders.
Can’t say anything not nice about them. They were excellent.
