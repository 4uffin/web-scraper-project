We arrived later than expected due to ferry from the islands to Chumphon being delayed. When asking about a good restaurant for dinner we were offered a free ride to their suggestion and they arranged for restaurant owners to drive us back. Our departing flight left early in the morning and Jeff once again drove us to the airport. We wished we would have stayed longer and next time certainly will.Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.89.8Exceptional - What previous guests thought, 223 reviews Exceptional · 223 reviewsFrom $31 per nightHome of DusitaHotel in LamphunLocated in Lamphun, 17 miles from Grand Canyon Chiang Mai, Home of Dusita provides accommodations with free bikes, free private parking, an outdoor swimming pool and a garden.
