Very modern, clean,and spacious. Everything felt brand new. Great breakfast with a wide variety of local and international options. The hotel put in an extra effort to make our anniversary special, which was very much appreciated! Nice pool area and dining options (we ate at the burger restaurant which had great cocktails). The complimentary shuttle bus to and from the airport is a great service too. All the staff were very friendly and helpful. Overall, a fantastic option for anyone with an early flight the next day who needs to be within 20 minutes of the airport. There are additional restaurants close by and a shopping centre just up the road which is convenient.

Located in Bangkok, 1.5 miles from MBK Shopping Mall, dusitD2 Samyan Bangkok has accommodations with an outdoor swimming pool, free private parking, a fitness center and a restaurant.
The room was spacious. Location was good. Samyan near to Chula area and Bantat Thong. Was there during the recent earthquake. Staff was super helpful. Even prepared food and drinks and ushered us to nearby low rise sister hotel for refuge. Kept all the guests updated and got us back to the hotel as soon as circumstances allowed. Remember none of the staff experienced this situation before. The alarm was raised in a very timely manner following the first tremor. I saw that the staff even went above and beyond what was required. Saw them buy change of clothing for a couple who were in bathrobes, counselling guests who were in shock etc. Thank you for taking care of all of us! üíì
