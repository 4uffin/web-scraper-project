The Social Hub Porto
Hotel in Porto City Centre , Porto
9.0
Wonderful
1,497 reviews
Conveniently set in Porto, The Social Hub Porto provides air-conditioned rooms, an outdoor swimming pool, free WiFi and a fitness center.
Staying at The Social Hub Porto is always a treat—its playful interior and laid-back vibe perfectly match my mood in a city as vibrant as this. After exploring Porto on foot and staying in three different locations, I can confidently say this is my favorite spot. It's super central—just steps from main squares, lively streets, the train station, and a short downhill stroll to the Douro River.
We lucked out with a room in the iconic curved façade, complete with big windows looking out over the street—absolutely gorgeous. The hotel itself is full of great amenities, but the rooftop bar and pool are the real cherry on top. Whether it’s morning coffee or an afternoon cooldown, it’s the perfect place to chill, recharge, or simply enjoy the view.
With Porto’s amazing brunch scene just outside the door, we skipped the hotel breakfast and embraced the motto hanging on the flag in every room: "Let's stay in"—unless it's for pancakes. Next time I’m in Porto, I’ll be checking TSH availability first—no question about it.

Wonderful

Located in Porto, 1.8 miles from FC Porto Museum, Hotels 705 Porto Prime Home provides accommodations with a fitness center, private parking, a garden and a terrace. This 4-star hotel offers a bar.
This property was small but rooms are very spacious. We were pleasantly surprised when our room was upgraded because we were celebrating a birthday. Our room was very spacious, modern and clean. It is good value for money for sure. Very attentive employees, they made our stay very very special. They made sure we had everything we needed. And the everyday housekeeping was a bonus. The sunsets from our balcony was soo beautiful. And we slept amazing on these huge beds. For us girlies, it made us happy that the mirrors were big too.
