Explore and find Hotels in Portugal
Portugal is crammed with history, culture and cuisine, and these three characteristics have seen it visited by over 10 million tourists a year (and counting). Add stunning scenery to that list and you’ve got an endless supply of activities to keep you occupied.
The country is renowned for its enchanting cities, with the capital of Lisbon perched on the edge of the Atlantic Ocean. Its distinctive culture is emphasised by traditional fado music reverberating through the charming cobblestone streets and pastelarias serving up delicious pastéis de nata (custard tarts). For a unique way to explore the beautiful old town, hop aboard tram 28 – one of a few old fashioned tram lines still operating in Lisbon today.
Porto, the second-largest city, offers up a charming medieval centre, coastal walks and bistros serving up ‘Francesinha’– a typical meat and cheese-filled sandwich distinctive to the city. Many popular beaches can be found closeby, such as the scenic shores of Gaia or Espinho. Hotels, B&Bs and apartments are dotted all over the country. You’ll also find a variety of guest houses and unique accommodation houses in charming manor houses or restored stone cottages and farmhouses.
