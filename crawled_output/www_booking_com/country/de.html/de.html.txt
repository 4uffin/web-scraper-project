Wonderful
1,071 reviews
Located in Hamburg and with Hamburg Central Station reachable within 7.8 miles, Clounys Hotel has concierge services, non-smoking rooms, a terrace, free WiFi and a restaurant.
Everything! The staff were super friendly and helpful from check-in to check-out. Our room was perfectly laid out and clean and perfectly appointed. Loved the windows to the street. It was warm and cozy when we wanted and nice and cool when we needed it to be. One of the best rooms I’ve ever slept in. The bed was amazing! Live the location as it wasn’t in the hustle and bustle of downtown. The train station is right outside the front door so not is easy to get anywhere you want. No parking lot but there is street side parking all over the place. If we return to Hamburg, we will be staying at Clouneys!
