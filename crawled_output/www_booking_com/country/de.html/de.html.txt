Breakfast is fabulous.
Great underground parking.

Wonderful
1,075 reviews
Located in Hamburg and with Hamburg Central Station reachable within 7.8 miles, Clounys Hotel has concierge services, non-smoking rooms, a terrace, free WiFi and a restaurant.
Everything! The staff were super friendly and helpful from check-in to check-out. Our room was perfectly laid out and clean and perfectly appointed. Loved the windows to the street. It was warm and cozy when we wanted and nice and cool when we needed it to be. One of the best rooms Iâ€™ve ever slept in. The bed was amazing! Live the location as it wasnâ€™t in the hustle and bustle of downtown. The train station is right outside the front door so not is easy to get anywhere you want. No parking lot but there is street side parking all over the place. If we return to Hamburg, we will be staying at Clouneys!

sly Berlin
Hotel in Friedrichshain, Berlin
9.0
Wonderful
2,797 reviews
Located in Berlin, 1.8 miles from Alexanderplatz Metro Station, sly Berlin provides accommodations with a fitness center, private parking, a restaurant and a bar.
This hotel was fantastic, super modern and very well put together. The decor was amazing and the check in process was really easy. The staff were very nice and the service was amazing. I got to the room and I was blown away with how beautiful the room was, the pictures really do not do it justice nor was I expecting it based from the photos. Extremely high ceilings and was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept on in my entire life. I will be coming back to this hotel next time I am in Berlin because I was more than happy with my stay at Sly Berlin.
