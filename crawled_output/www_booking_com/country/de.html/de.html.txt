Its capital, Berlin, is defined by innovation, eco-friendliness and natural beauty. Ascend the glass dome of Reichstag for sweeping views of the city. You’ll spot futuristic buildings like Bahn Tower sitting alongside war-surviving monuments like the iconic Brandenburg Gate – a centrepiece that now symbolises the reunification of Germany after the infamous wall was knocked down. Explore this history-steeped city on foot, or hire a bike and enjoy the many cycling paths that run through pristine parks and along the River Spree. In the south, Munich is known for its distinctly Bavarian heritage. Head to Marienplatz to feel the pulse of the city. Here, lively beer gardens like Hofbräuhaus sit beneath imposing medieval architecture, serving traditional German lager and plates piled high with bratwurst. Meanwhile, the likes of Hamburg and Cologne provide plenty more in the way of classical music, fine art and urban appeal. In between all this, you’ll find a vast, sprawling land of alpine terrain and ancient, mythical forests. Hike through hills and valleys in the legendary Black Forest, paddle past hillside castles in the Rhine, or find peace in a quiet town on the banks of Lake Constance. Accommodation options are ample through Germany. Expect luxury hotels, chic apartments and hip hostels in the big cities, and gorgeous log cabins in the countryside.Top picks for hotels in GermanyTry one of these popular and highly-rated Germany hotelsSee allParkhotel Stuttgart Messe-AirportHotel in Leinfelden-EchterdingenScored out of 10, guest rating 9.09.0Superb - What previous guests thought, 2,355 reviews Superb · 2,355 reviewsThis hotel stands beside Echterdingen S-Bahn Train Station, just one stop from Stuttgart Airport and Stuttgart Exhibition Centre.Show moreFrom £117 per nightRioca Stuttgart Posto 4Hotel in StuttgartScored out of 10, guest rating 9.09.0Superb - What previous guests thought, 4,176 reviews Superb · 4,176 reviewsLocated 7.2 km from Stockexchange Stuttgart, Rioca Stuttgart Posto 4 offers accommodation in Stuttgart with access to a fitness room.Show moreFrom £73 per nightRioca Stuttgart Posto 6Hotel in StuttgartScored out of 10, guest rating 9.19.1Superb - What previous guests thought, 3,637 reviews Superb · 3,637 reviewsSituated within 8.5 km of Fair Stuttgart and 10 km of Fairground Sindelfingen in Stuttgart, Rioca Stuttgart Posto 6 provides accommodation with seating area.Show moreFrom £78 per nightStrandhotel HeringsdorfHotel in HeringsdorfScored out of 10, guest rating 9.09.0Superb - What previous guests thought, 1,055 reviews Superb · 1,055 reviewsThis 4-star hotel offers direct access to the sandy Heringsdorf Beach, on the Baltic Sea island of Usedom.

Guest reviewThe general athmosphere is characterized by flexibility and an easy-going vibe, but this does not come at the expense of professionalism, but actually makes the stay perfect. Communication is easy, there's an answer to any and all requests and there are some unique options (like choosing your preferred pillow type or accessing drinks 24/7) which go the extra mile.

It lies in Westerland on the North Sea island of Sylt. Guest reviewExcellent, owner run boutique hotel in Westerland. Exceptional care is put on customer satisfaction by the owner. She is clearly passionate about hospitality and this hotel in particular. Newly renovated, very tasteful. The rooms are very large and have all that one needs.
The breakfast deserves as special mention: it is surprising, lots of little tasty pleasantries. On top there is a buffet and one can order eggs etc. One of the best breakfasts we had.
Certainly a recommendation. We will book the Hotel Atlantic again for sure.Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.69.6Exceptional - What previous guests thought, 297 reviews Exceptional · 297 reviewsFrom £235 per nightSchloß OrtHotel in PassauBest location in the old town Our hotel is surrounded by a peaceful atmosphere - directly on the southern bank of the river next to the castle park with no road in between.

Guest reviewA splendid authentic castle atop a hill by the river Rhine, this hotel offers majestic vistas and cozy stylish rooms. It really has the atmosphere of a castle rather than that of yet another hotel you visit. It's a long way from the parking to the reception (and then to your room through a little maze of corridors and stairs, which is typical for a castle), but they have a luggage service with a golf cart, which is rather useful.Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.69.6Exceptional - What previous guests thought, 642 reviews Exceptional · 642 reviewsFrom £271 per nightWellness & Naturresort ReischlhofHotel in WegscheidSet in Wegscheid, 31 km from Train Station Passau, Wellness & Naturresort Reischlhof offers accommodation with an outdoor swimming pool, free private parking, a fitness centre and a garden.
