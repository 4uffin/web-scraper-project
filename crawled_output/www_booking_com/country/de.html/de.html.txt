The warm Bavarian hospitality made a lasting impression – from the genuinely friendly staff to the delicious, traditional food. Even for a short stay, it felt cozy and welcoming. A great bonus: the hotel is just a short walk from the EFA Mobile Zeiten museum, which is a must-visit for car enthusiasts. A perfect mix of comfort, charm, and convenience. Highly recommended, even for a quick stop!Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.59.5Exceptional - What previous guests thought, 1,006 reviews Exceptional · 1,006 reviewsFrom $159 per nightMost booked hotels in Germany in the past monthSee allIntercityHotel Berlin Airport BER Terminal 1 & 2Hotel in SchönefeldPopular with guests booking hotels in SchönefeldScored out of 10, guest rating 8.88.8Excellent - What previous guests thought, 23,212 reviews Excellent · 23,212 reviewsSheraton Frankfurt Airport Hotel & Conference CenterHotel in FrankfurtPopular with guests booking hotels in FrankfurtScored out of 10, guest rating 8.38.3Very Good - What previous guests thought, 14,280 reviews Very Good · 14,280 reviewsRamada Encore by Wyndham Munich MesseHotel in Trudering - Riem, MunichPopular with guests booking hotels in MunichScored out of 10, guest rating 8.38.3Very Good - What previous guests thought, 5,571 reviews Very Good · 5,571 reviewsa&o Hamburg CityHotel in Hammerbrook, HamburgPopular with guests booking hotels in HamburgScored out of 10, guest rating 7.07.0Good - What previous guests thought, 17,116 reviews Good · 17,116 reviewsPrize by Radisson, Hamburg CityHotel in Hammerbrook, HamburgPopular with guests booking hotels in HamburgScored out of 10, guest rating 7.87.8Good - What previous guests thought, 26,202 reviews Good · 26,202 reviewsPremier Inn Düsseldorf City FriedrichstadtHotel in City Center, DüsseldorfPopular with guests booking hotels in DüsseldorfScored out of 10, guest rating 8.28.2Very Good - What previous guests thought, 6,736 reviews Very Good · 6,736 reviewsH2 Hotel München OlympiaparkHotel in Milbertshofen - Am Hart, MunichPopular with guests booking hotels in MunichScored out of 10, guest rating 8.28.2Very Good - What previous guests thought, 28,442 reviews Very Good · 28,442 reviewsa&o München HackerbrückeHotel in Neuhausen - Nymphenburg, MunichPopular with guests booking hotels in MunichScored out of 10, guest rating 7.07.0Good - What previous guests thought, 8,206 reviews Good · 8,206 reviewsPark Inn by Radisson Berlin AlexanderplatzHotel in Mitte, BerlinPopular with guests booking hotels in BerlinScored out of 10, guest rating 7.97.9Good - What previous guests thought, 14,620 reviews Good · 14,620 reviewsMotel One Berlin-AlexanderplatzHotel in Mitte, BerlinPopular with guests booking hotels in BerlinScored out of 10, guest rating 8.78.7Excellent - What previous guests thought, 16,442 reviews Excellent · 16,442 reviewsFly to the most popular airportsFrankfurt Airport (FRA)Frankfurt, GermanyMunich Airport (MUC)Munich, GermanyBerlin Brandenburg Airport (BER)Berlin, GermanyHamburg Airport (HAM)Hamburg, GermanyDüsseldorf Airport (DUS)Düsseldorf, GermanyStuttgart Airport (STR)Stuttgart, GermanyCologne Bonn Airport (CGN)Cologne, GermanyHannover Airport (HAJ)Hannover, GermanyLeipzig/Halle Airport (LEJ)Leipzig, GermanyNurnberg Airport (NUE)Nuremberg, GermanyFrankfurt-Hahn Airport (HHN)Frankfurt, GermanyMemmingen Airport (FMM)Memmingen, GermanyResearch, refine, and make plans for your whole tripCheap vacations in BerlinPlan everything you need for your vacation in one place – from flights and stays to tours and activitiesWhen to visit GermanyEvents, prices, weather, and more.Hotels in FranceExtend your trip or start planning your next adventure.Hotels in PolandExtend your trip or start planning your next adventure.Hotels in the United StatesStart planning your next trip.Hotels in SpainStart planning your next trip.Hotels near Frankfurt AirportFind hotels conveniently close to one of the country's most popular airports – perfect for a late arrival or early departure.Hotels near Munich AirportPerfect for a late arrival or early departure.Flights to GermanySearch, compare, and book flights with ease.Show moreCountriesRegionsCitiesDistrictsAirportsHotelsPlaces of interestVacation HomesApartmentsResortsVillasHostelsB&BsGuest HousesUnique places to stayAll destinationsAll flight destinationsAll car rental locationsAll vacation destinationsGuidesDiscoverReviewsDiscover monthly staysSupportCoronavirus (COVID-19) FAQsManage your tripsContact Customer ServiceSafety Resource CenterDiscoverGenius loyalty programSeasonal and holiday dealsTravel articlesBooking.com for BusinessTraveller Review AwardsCar rentalFlight finderRestaurant reservationsBooking.com for Travel AgentsTerms and settingsPrivacy & cookiesTerms of ServiceAccessibility StatementDispute resolutionModern Slavery StatementHuman Rights StatementPartnersExtranet loginPartner helpList your propertyBecome an affiliateAboutAbout Booking.comHow We WorkSustainabilityPress centerCareersInvestor relationsCorporate contactContent guidelines and reportingUSDBooking.com is part of Booking Holdings Inc., the world leader in online travel and related services.
