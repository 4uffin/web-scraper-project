voco Auckland City Centre by IHG
Hotel in Auckland Central Business District, Auckland
9.1
Wonderful
2,173 reviews
Conveniently set in the center of Auckland, voco Auckland City Centre by IHG provides air-conditioned rooms, a fitness center, free WiFi and a restaurant.
We had a fabulous experience at voco Auckland! The staff were absolutely wonderful and made our stay extra special as it was my birthday celebration. On our two separate stays, we were given beautiful rooms—one overlooking the harbour and another with a stunning bay view of the Sky Tower. Both rooms were modern, spotless, and perfectly sized for a couple.
A thoughtful gesture was the sweet treats sent up for my birthday, which truly made me feel celebrated. The restaurant, Mozzarella & Co., offered delicious food, and the servers were attentive and warm throughout.
Every day of our stay was enjoyable, and the location of the hotel is just perfect—right in a prime spot and very well maintained. Despite our early morning arrival, we were kindly allowed to check in before the standard time, which we greatly appreciated.
Thank you to the entire team for the excellent service and hospitality. We loved every moment and will definitely be returning on our next visit to Auckland!
