It is a 5-minute walk to the center of Queenstown. Free Wi-Fi and parking is available. Guest reviewIf you’re traveling to Queenstown, this is the hotel you must stay in! From the moment I arrived, I felt completely at home. The hotel is family-owned, and their warmth and personal touch make the experience exceptional—you feel like a valued guest and even part of the family.
The interior design is stunning, with a perfect blend of charm and comfort. My room was a highlight, featuring a unique open-ceiling bathroom that allowed natural light to filter through—such a beautiful touch. Everything in the room was thoughtfully arranged for both comfort and style.
The location is unbeatable: close to the heart of Queenstown but still peaceful and quiet, making it the perfect base for exploring the area. What truly stood out, though, was the incredible hospitality. Every single staff member welcomed me with genuine smiles and made me feel truly cared for.
I can’t recommend Queenstown Park Boutique Hotel enough. It’s not just a place to stay—it’s an experience that adds to the magic of Queenstown.Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.59.5Exceptional - What previous guests thought, 387 reviews Exceptional · 387 reviewsFrom $477 per nightTussock Hill Vineyard RetreatsHotel in ChristchurchLocated in Christchurch, 4.9 miles from Christchurch Art Gallery, Tussock Hill Vineyard Retreats has accommodations with free WiFi and free private parking.
