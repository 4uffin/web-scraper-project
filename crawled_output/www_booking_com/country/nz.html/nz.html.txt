Wow what a nice hotel. It truly feels and looks like a 5 star hotel. It was super clean and the rooms were quiet which made it feel like I was at home in my own comfort. There is a restaurant at the bottom and I highly recommend it. The chef is French and it honestly shows in the passion he puts in each plate. Great place overall
