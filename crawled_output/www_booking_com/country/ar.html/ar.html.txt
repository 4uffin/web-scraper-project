The outside area on the property was also gorgeous - pool, beach access, lots of lounge areas. But most outstanding part of our stay was the customer service - the front desk was instantly responsive on WhatsApp even before we arrived. They booked us restaurants, recommended day trips, customized breakfast for us when what we wanted wasn’t on the menu.
