Wonderful

Located in Buenos Aires and with Centro Cultural Kirchner reachable within 1.5 miles, SLS Buenos Aires Puerto Madero provides concierge services, non-smoking rooms, a garden, free WiFi throughout the...
The hotel is located in a very safe and modern area, with various restaurants nearby by the canal. The hotel has a nice pool, although I wish the water was warmer and that it was positioned more in the sun, as it gets shaded in the afternoon. Unfortunately, the front pool, located at the entrance of the hotel, was not accessible to all guests, which was a bit disappointing.
Breakfast was excellent, and the staff was very kind and understanding. They even made sure I could check into my room earlier than the standard check-in time. Overall, a great experience!
