Guest reviewAfter a long trip throughout Vietnam and staying in many places, we decided to pick this hotel for our last destination before heading back home.
It was by far the best accommodation we had in Vietnam and had everything you could hope for. The rooms were nice, clean, quiet and comfortable. The location was perfect, the pool was amazing, price was extremely good value… and then of course the staff. Linda and Kevin were absolutely perfect. Between providing us with the best recommandations, organizing our rides to the airport, their friendliness and how accommodating they were… Literally made us feel at home. Kevin was reaching out long before our check-in to make sure our arrival would be perfect, and he did such a great job.
