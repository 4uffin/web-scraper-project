For most visitors, it all starts – or ends – in Hanoi, the chaotic capital of the north. Here, you’ll find golden temples, Buddha shrines and holy monasteries beside bustling markets, manic streets and towering skyscrapers. East of here is Halong Bay, the now iconic archipelago of soaring limestone cliffs, which feels a world away. Take a junk boat tour through the bay to appreciate this natural wonder in all its glory.
At its narrowest point – roughly halfway down the elongated S-shaped land area – Vietnam is just 50 km across. Nearby are more natural wonders, like the sprawling Phong Nha-Ke National Park. Above ground, this park is a jungle wilderness, while below it is a vast network of caves, with the world’s biggest among them. Further south, historic Hoi An preserves a legacy of ancient customs in its old town, while Nha Trang’s crescent-shaped beaches offer access to offshore islands. And then there’s Ho Chi Minh, a city with as much energy as the capital, but different in so many ways. If there’s one thing you should embrace here, it’s the incredibly varied and delicious street food – but a sobering visit to the War Remnants Museum is also worthwhile. Vietnam is very well-developed, so you can rest assured of finding accommodation all over the country – even in remote places like Sapa in the north. Options include hotels, hostels and eco-lodges.

Guest reviewThe couple - owner - is just cute and accomodating. They have lots of comics, toys, a dog and a cat running around, cute, active, may be cautious at first but just spend a few mins and they would be lovely to play with. The place is quite near the center, got bikes for rent, you can just communicate your needs and I think they will try to accomodate. Also located in the foothill, take a walk to the top for a broad view of the city, cool.

Will was an amazing host and helped us with local recommendations and advice for our time in Hoi An. The bicycles at the hotel are new and great for getting to the old town and the beach. You’re in a great position to get to both meaning you get the best of both worlds. The laundry and airport drop off was also great.
