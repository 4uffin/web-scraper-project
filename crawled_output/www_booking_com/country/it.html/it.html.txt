We spent our wedding anniversary here and we couldnâ€™t be happier. We got upgraded to a panoramic room with a beautiful balcony and were welcomed with a bottle of Prosecco. Giulia ensured we have a great time and personalized the experience, left cute notes in the room wishing us a happy anniversary and made sure everything was going perfectly. I highly recommend staying at the hotel. The service is exceptional and the location is perfectly central

Wonderful

Featuring a garden, a shared lounge as well as a bar, Hotel Maximus is located in the center of Rome, a 3-minute walk from Repubblica - Teatro dell'Opera Metro Station.
Very nice hotel. Easy walk from the station, to sights, restaurants, and parks. The breakfast selection is one of the best I have seen in Roma. I chose the smallest room which was adequate, clean and comfortable. Furnishings and fixtures are all relatively new. This is a family run hotel and everyone was extremely nice. A special thank you to Roberta and Giulia working the front desk. I visit Roma several times a year and this is now my go to place. It is always people that make a moment memorable and all who work here contribute to the experience.
