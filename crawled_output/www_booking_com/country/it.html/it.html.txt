HOTEL DELLE CIVETTE
Hotel in Nomentano, Rome
9.0
Wonderful
1,273 reviews
Located in Rome, a 9-minute walk from Bologna Metro Station, HOTEL DELLE CIVETTE provides accommodations with a garden, private parking, a shared lounge and a terrace.
It was actually a transit for a (full) day in Rome. Instead of booking a hotel near FCO which was more expensive than this room rate, and not forget about the expensive fare for airport pick up+ drop off. I was extremely happy and satisfied with my last night staying in Rome. Such a beautiful fine hotel, the room is super clean, there is a garden in the property where I could do my exercise in the morning then head to hotel breakfast, warm and helpful hotel staff. The location looks far from FCO but it is actually very convenient to get there. If you travel light, just take the Leonardo Express direct train from FCO (€15) to Roma termini, hop on Bus 82 right in front of the termini, and a short walking distance you will reach the hotel. If you travel with big luggage bags, I chose to ride
the taxi/uber from the hotel to Roma termini to the airport the next day. The taxi ride cost me €15.50.
As for last night in Rome, I was happy l could enjoy a nice Cacciò e Peppe and delicious pizza at Mamma Pizza by just walking distance before leaving Italia.
