We travel a lot throughout Italy and usually the staff far exceed the accommodations so you might overlook the shortcomings. This hotel is the complete package.
We stayed for a week and traveled around the area. Claudio and his staff were welcoming, helpful, down to earth, and the hotel room was great.
Spacious with a great view of the valley below us.

I truly made a right decision choosing this property, because all of us had a wonderful and amazing time there.
All team members provided us such a great and sincere hospitality. Not to mention that all facilities from rooms, food & beverages quality, restaurants, surroundings of the hotel; I have only one word to describe, are TOP NOTCH!
I have travelled to many countries and places and would normally look to travel/stay at somewhere different, I must say Monteverdi is one of the few places I am looking forward to go back againShow moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.89.8Exceptional - What previous guests thought, 30 reviews Exceptional · 30 reviewsFrom $1,258 per nightMonastero Santa Rosa Hotel & SpaHotel in Conca dei MariniThis luxurious adult-only hotel is perched on a cliff with panoramic views of the Gulf of Salerno. Guest reviewTime at the monastero is everything you might expect for a 5 star resort experience with some notable distinctions.
Amazing attention to detail
and systems of management, result in a sense of tranquility which is hugely amplified by the monastery setting. This really can't be overstated. The peaceful environment they create here is quite precious.
Secondly, having a limited number guests (20), means that there is a sense of privacy missing from some resorts or hotels.
Thirdly, the views are literally some of the best photos from our trip.
Fourthly, the generosity and warmth of the staff in every area is 100% consistent. A great credit to management.
Loved our stay.
Obviously not an every holiday option, but a special stay that will be remembered for a very long time.Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.99.9Exceptional - What previous guests thought, 98 reviews Exceptional · 98 reviewsFrom $1,811 per nightCastello di Casalborgone, Luxury Italian Castle HotelHotel in CasalborgoneLocated in Casalborgone, 21 miles from Mole Antonelliana, Castello di Casalborgone, Luxury Italian Castle Hotel has accommodations with a garden, free private parking, a terrace and a restaurant.
