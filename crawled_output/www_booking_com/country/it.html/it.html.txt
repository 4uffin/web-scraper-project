What was meant to be a three-night stay quickly turned into four, because everything was so wonderful — we simply didn’t want to leave.
Here are a few of our favorite things about Monteverdi:
First, the location and views. Each morning, we went on long hikes through the rolling Tuscan hills, soaking in the breathtaking scenery of this UNESCO-protected landscape. Every evening, we watched the sunset in peaceful awe. Time slows down here — and you truly learn to savor each moment.
Second, the food. Every single meal was exceptional. The team sources fresh, local ingredients and crafts them into dishes that are both comforting and inspired. We looked forward to breakfast every morning, trying something new each time. And dinner? Even better. Riccardo and his team curated a seasonal menu that we absolutely loved — and since we dined there nearly every night, they even created a few special off-menu dishes just for us, which was such a memorable touch.
Third, the experiences. From wine tasting at Le Ripi to day trips through charming nearby towns, there’s so much to explore. We also made time to relax at the property — the pool, sauna, and spa treatments were some of the best we’ve ever experienced.
And above all, the people. Every member of the Monteverdi team was warm, welcoming, and genuinely dedicated to making us feel at home. Their hospitality created a space where we could truly unwind and be present.
Monteverdi is a place that stays with you — and we’re already counting down the days until we return.Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.89.8Exceptional - What previous guests thought, 30 reviews Exceptional · 30 reviewsFrom $1,262 per nightMonastero Santa Rosa Hotel & SpaHotel in Conca dei MariniThis luxurious adult-only hotel is perched on a cliff with panoramic views of the Gulf of Salerno.

Guest reviewA truly magical experience staying at Borgo Del Cabreo!! From start to finish, we were made to feel welcome, and cared for. The views are incredibly wonderful, yet private. Because of its limited accomodations, the guest list is small and thus, intimate. The Staff is very friendly, helpful and will go out of their way to care for their Guests. The location, while close to town, is private, behind an access gate.
