Guest reviewThe staff was exceptionally friendly and welcoming. The food was superb. We throughly enjoyed the fireplace in our junior suite which was spacious, warm, and inviting. Every little detail was thought of from hooks in the right places to enough hangars to coffee pods. The hotel is beautifully decorated, reflecting its long history. It's obvious that the family is very proud of their hotel and deservedly so.Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.89.8Exceptional - What previous guests thought, 53 reviews Exceptional · 53 reviewsFrom $491 per nightHotel Krone RegensbergHotel in RegensbergLocated in Regensberg, 10 miles from Swiss National Museum, Hotel Krone Regensberg provides accommodations with free bikes, private parking, a shared lounge and a terrace.

Guest reviewSecluded in the top of Engelberg in the last street, Villa Hundert’s location is very romantic. When you enter the building, you immediately feel the owners’ touch and soul in everything what’s inside. What Christian and John built here is truly outstanding. It is a full experience and journey, starting with the accessories in the room, the common living room upstairs, and then the main attraction: food and wine. We had quite a few gastronomic experiences with my wife so far, but John’s cuisine paired with Christian’s wine sortiment topped everything we ever experienced. The ski bus has a stop right under Villa Hundert, so transportation to the Titlis cablecar is easy. Highly recommended for everyone, who’s looking for a unique and special experience, paired with skiing or snowboarding. This is the perfect choice for a romantic weekend. We will definitely come back!Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.99.9Exceptional - What previous guests thought, 81 reviews Exceptional · 81 reviewsFrom $687 per nightSuitenhotel ZurbriggenHotel in ZermattOwned by the famous skier Pirmin Zurbriggen, the Suitenhotel in Zermatt can be found just 328 feet from the Matterhorn Express Cable Car and offers you rooms and suites with Matterhorn views, as well...Guest reviewQuiet, intimate, great location, great view, excellent service and spa facilitiesShow moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.79.7Exceptional - What previous guests thought, 190 reviews Exceptional · 190 reviewsFrom $388 per nightMost booked hotels in Switzerland in the past monthSee allMEININGER Hotel Zürich GreencityHotel in Wollishofen, ZurichPopular with guests booking hotels in ZurichScored out of 10, guest rating 8.18.1Very Good - What previous guests thought, 7,948 reviews Very Good · 7,948 reviewsibis budget Zurich AirportHotel in GlattbruggPopular with guests booking hotels in GlattbruggScored out of 10, guest rating 7.67.6Good - What previous guests thought, 13,894 reviews Good · 13,894 reviewsB&B HOTEL Geneva AirportHotel in GenevaPopular with guests booking hotels in GenevaScored out of 10, guest rating 8.78.7Excellent - What previous guests thought, 10,165 reviews Excellent · 10,165 reviewsFunny Farm BackpackersHotel in InterlakenPopular with guests booking hotels in InterlakenScored out of 10, guest rating 7.87.8Good - What previous guests thought, 3,486 reviews Good · 3,486 reviewsCapsule Hotel - Zurich AirportHotel in KlotenPopular with guests booking hotels in KlotenScored out of 10, guest rating 8.38.3Very Good - What previous guests thought, 13,198 reviews Very Good · 13,198 reviewsibis budget Basel CityHotel in BaselPopular with guests booking hotels in BaselScored out of 10, guest rating 7.47.4Good - What previous guests thought, 9,639 reviews Good · 9,639 reviewsNash Airport HotelHotel in GenevaPopular with guests booking hotels in GenevaScored out of 10, guest rating 8.28.2Very Good - What previous guests thought, 12,957 reviews Very Good · 12,957 reviewsRadisson Blu Hotel Zurich AirportHotel in KlotenPopular with guests booking hotels in KlotenScored out of 10, guest rating 8.48.4Very Good - What previous guests thought, 3,318 reviews Very Good · 3,318 reviewsOlympia Hotel ZurichHotel in Aussersihl, ZurichPopular with guests booking hotels in ZurichScored out of 10, guest rating 7.17.1Good - What previous guests thought, 3,718 reviews Good · 3,718 reviewsMotel One ZürichHotel in Enge, ZurichPopular with guests booking hotels in ZurichScored out of 10, guest rating 8.48.4Very Good - What previous guests thought, 9,628 reviews Very Good · 9,628 reviewsFly to the most popular airportsZurich Airport (ZRH)Zurich, SwitzerlandGeneva International Airport (GVA)Geneva, SwitzerlandBasel-Mulhouse Airport (BSL)Basel, SwitzerlandSt. Gallen-Altenrhein Airport (ACH)Altenrhein, SwitzerlandResearch, refine, and make plans for your whole tripHotels in FranceThinking about extending your trip or planning your next adventure?
