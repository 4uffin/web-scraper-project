They went out of their way to make us feel at home and ensure everything was just right.
The meals were incredible, not only because of the beautiful patio with its charming views, but also thanks to the truly impressive quality and creativity of the food. Every dish we tried was delicious and beautifully presented, showing so much care and attention to detail.
The hotel itself is such a special place. The spaces are tastefully designed and full of character, and we were so comfortable and relaxed throughout our stay. It felt like a peaceful retreat.
This place is an absolute gem, and we can’t wait to come back again soon.

Guest reviewA Warm and Modern Swiss Retreat
Staying at this property was an absolute delight. It strikes a perfect balance between warmth and modernity—cozy yet stylish, charming yet contemporary. From the moment I arrived, the staff made me feel incredibly welcome, going above and beyond to ensure my stay was exceptional.
The room itself had thoughtful touches that added to the experience, including a record player, which made for a nostalgic and relaxing evening. The design blends modern surfaces with an inviting atmosphere, making it feel like a home away from home.
The restaurant was another highlight. With a chef whose creations are truly Michelin-quality, every meal was a masterpiece. Even when I woke up late and had missed the designated breakfast hours, the staff graciously prepared a meal for me, a gesture that speaks volumes about their hospitality.
The location is in a charming, modern Swiss village, offering the best of both worlds—scenic beauty and contemporary convenience. Outside, a beautiful courtyard adds to the ambiance, providing a perfect spot to unwind.
But what truly sets this place apart is the warmth of the people. Their kindness, attention to detail, and genuine hospitality made my stay unforgettable. If you’re looking for a place that combines Swiss charm with modern comfort, this is it.Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.69.6Exceptional - What previous guests thought, 40 reviews Exceptional · 40 reviewsFrom $299 per nightHotel de l’Ours PrelesHotel in PrêlesLocated in Prêles, 27 miles from International Watch and Clock Museum, Hotel de l’Ours Preles provides accommodations with a garden, free private parking, a shared lounge and a terrace.

Guest reviewSecluded in the top of Engelberg in the last street, Villa Hundert’s location is very romantic. When you enter the building, you immediately feel the owners’ touch and soul in everything what’s inside. What Christian and John built here is truly outstanding. It is a full experience and journey, starting with the accessories in the room, the common living room upstairs, and then the main attraction: food and wine. We had quite a few gastronomic experiences with my wife so far, but John’s cuisine paired with Christian’s wine sortiment topped everything we ever experienced. The ski bus has a stop right under Villa Hundert, so transportation to the Titlis cablecar is easy. Highly recommended for everyone, who’s looking for a unique and special experience, paired with skiing or snowboarding. This is the perfect choice for a romantic weekend. We will definitely come back!Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.99.9Exceptional - What previous guests thought, 81 reviews Exceptional · 81 reviewsFrom $685 per nightThe Capra Saas-FeeHotel in Saas-FeeFeaturing an indoor pool and a spa and wellness centre, The Capra Saas-Fee is an elegant, Alpine-style hotel located in Saas-Fee’s centre, just a 2-to 5-minute walk from several ski lifts.
