ALPINE INN Davos
Hotel in Davos
9.0
Wonderful
1,890 reviews
Located in Davos, a 8-minute walk from Davos Congress Center, ALPINE INN Davos has accommodations with a garden, private parking, a shared lounge and a terrace.
Modern and well-decorated hotel. The bus station is right in front, therefore it's very easy to come by public transportation. I had the chance to get my room straight when I've arrived and before the usual check-in time: it has allowed me to work remotely without any stress, so thanks a lot, this has been highly appreciated. The view on the snowy mountain is really beautiful. The breakfast is also excellent with a lot of choices. Last but not least, the barman and the ladies at the reception were absolutely amazing.

9.1
Wonderful
1,397 reviews
Sorell Hotel St. Peter has free bikes, fitness center, a garden and shared lounge in Zurich. This 4-star hotel offers room service, a 24-hour front desk and free WiFi.
This is one of my favourite hotels in Zurich. It is my go-to place when I am here. The hotel is ideally situated close to Bahnhofstrasse and Paradaplatz square, and it is also within walking distance of both the lake and the train station. The staff is terrific. Very friendly and accommodating. They all made me feel like I have a home away from home.
