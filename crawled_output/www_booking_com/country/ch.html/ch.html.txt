Wonderful

The hotel is new (3 years) and located in the city center. My room was big and comfortable, well equipped and maintained.
The cleaning was excellent, and they did everything I asked with a smile. Breakfast was great, with a variety of food and also a menu that offered some more options. Great hotel by all aspects.

Wonderful
1,308 reviews
Featuring ski-to-door access, Stoos Lodge is located in Stoos in the Canton of Schwyz region, 20 miles from Einsiedeln Abbey and 27 miles from KKL Culture and Convention Center Lucerne.
The location of the hotel was exceptional. You can enjoy the alpine beauty from the balcony. Close to the hotel there was a souvenir shop which was also nice. Hiking area to Fronalpstock view point is nearby and you can also take the cable car. The staff were nice and friendly and helped us to correct our plan to visit Lucerne. The interior design was so nice and unique. Overall, this was the best hotel experience for me in Switzerland.

Hotel one66 (free parking garage)
Hotel in St. Gallen
9.0
Wonderful
1,255 reviews
Offering free garage parking, Hotel one66 is located in Sankt Gallen, directly at the motorway exit St. Gallen-Winkeln.
The staff (a man sorry did not get your name) who works there does most of everything (check-in, room service, breakfast) himself may be because we arrived quite late. Even though it was just him, everything was done quite efficiently. We requested additional pillows and he came right up. At breakfast, he did everything from filling the buffet bar up to cleaning the table and he did it so quickly and perfectly. Out of all the good things there, we were amazed by him the most. He work like owns the hotel (or may be he does) or else the owner should really give him a big bonus. Breakfast was of great quality (did not expect that at all in such a small hotel). Better than some hotels that cost more than twice as much during our trip. The scrambled eggs were delicious. The room was clean. We parked outside the hotel since there was a spot available. It was also free since it was part of the hotel area. Did not want to go down the underground garage because our car was quite big. The hotel is a recommend.

Cubilaris Motel
Hotel in Bad Ragaz
9.0
Wonderful
1,048 reviews
Featuring free bikes and views of mountain, Cubilaris Motel is located in Bad Ragaz, 14 miles from Salginatobel Bridge.
Clean and accommodating. The suite was great and had everything we needed. Our room was lovely and spacious. The view was of a green hedge, which was nice. I didn’t realize when I booked the motel that everything was do-it-yourself. Check-in machine in front of the door to get your key and key drop-off to check out. Everything went smoothly, but this could be an issue if any challenges arise that need to be dealt with by a real person.

We even got bicycles that allowed us to explore the cities more. The location is fantastic. We had our room on the 4th floor, and the view was just breathtaking. We even received some gifts to carry back home. WE Highly recommend the hotel.
