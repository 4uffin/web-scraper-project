Sky-high mountains, glinting glaciers, emerald lakes and epic train journeys – it’s everywhere you look, effectively making this multilingual country Europe’s prime adventure playground. In the south, Zermatt ski resort brims with cozy chalets beneath the towering hulk of 4,478-metre-high Matterhorn Mountain. Glide down the well-groomed pistes, or treat yourself to some off-piste tree runs – snow conditions here are rarely anything but perfect. Meanwhile, the frozen surface of Lake St. Moritz, to the east, plays host to unusual sports like skijoring, ice cricket and ‘White Turf’ horse racing. Come summer, snow and ice give way to shimmering lakes and great, green forests. It’s best appreciated in Interlaken, either from the 1,300-metre-high Harder Klum observation deck, or with a thrilling tandem paragliding experience through the valley. Alternatively, take a ride on an old-time steamboat to capture fairytale views of the fishing villages, farmhouses and hilltop fortresses either side of this central destination. All this rural beauty combines with a variety of captivating cities – capital Bern with its medieval old town, Germanic Basel and its head-turning architecture, chic Geneva and its taste for luxury, and sprawling Zürich with its artsy edge, riverside bars and fondue restaurants. There’s no shortage of accommodation options in Switzerland, with an abundance of hotels to choose from, plus many lodges, chalets and lakeview apartments available to rent throughout the country.Top picks for hotels in SwitzerlandTry one of these popular and highly-rated Switzerland hotelsSee allSee- und Seminarhotel FloraAlpina VitznauHotel in VitznauScored out of 10, guest rating 9.09.0Superb - What previous guests thought, 1,217 reviews Superb · 1,217 reviewsSee- und Seminarhotel FloraAlpina enjoys an idyllic location at the shores of Lake Lucerne, outside the village of Vitznau.Show moreFrom £160 per nightBest Western Hotel RebstockHotel in RorschacherbergScored out of 10, guest rating 9.19.1Superb - What previous guests thought, 1,267 reviews Superb · 1,267 reviewsThe BEST WESTERN Hotel Rebstock, run by the same family for 3 generations, offers panoramic views of Lake Constance from the restaurant, spacious rooms with a balcony, free WiFi and free parking on...Show moreFrom £157 per nightHotel Lago Maggiore - Welcome!Hotel in LocarnoScored out of 10, guest rating 9.49.4Superb - What previous guests thought, 1,511 reviews Superb · 1,511 reviewsHotel Lago Maggiore - Welcome! is situated on the beautiful lake promenade of Locarno, a few steps from the city centre.

Guest reviewUnexpectedly the most incredible hotel and dining experience we’ve probably ever had. We booked villa hundert as the last night after a multi day hike through the mountains and it was perfect. The room was beautiful and it was a great place to unwind. The whole hotel was beautiful, filled with candles and there were lovely communal spaces to enjoy. We went down for dinner and had a delicious cocktail and the first few courses on the terrace beside a wood fire with an incredible view of the mountains as it got dark. When we were ready we went inside to finish the meal. The hosts were so attentive and clearly so passionate about the project. The food was incredible - it was described as a love letter to Switzerland and you could really feel that. The music, the wine, the decor - everything was so beautiful with not a hint of pretension. We slept very soundly. The breakfast was also so thoughtfully done and we asked for scrambled eggs which were delicious and freshly made. I was so impressed by the whole experience, everything was thought through and so much care was given. We didn’t know what to expect when we booked but this was the highlight of our trip. I can’t say enough how highly I would recommend staying here. Thank you Christian, John and Anna. We hope to come back one day soon.Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.99.9Exceptional - What previous guests thought, 81 reviews Exceptional · 81 reviewsFrom £508 per nightThe Capra Saas-FeeHotel in Saas-FeeFeaturing an indoor pool and a spa and wellness centre, The Capra Saas-Fee is an elegant, Alpine-style hotel located in Saas-Fee’s centre, just a 2-to 5-minute walk from several ski lifts.
