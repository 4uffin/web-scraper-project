What spoiled it was taxis: prices were wildly inconsistent. A 12 km trip ranged from €28–35 (with traffic) to as high as €60. In a few cases the meter showed ~€28 but I was asked for €45. It left me feeling I had to pay whatever was demanded.Show morePGuest review byPeter6.0There are some lovely attractions in the city, for example...There are some lovely attractions in the city, for example the art museums.
