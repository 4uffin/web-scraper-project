The people, the history, the food, the buildings it was all amazing and highly recommend.
We did the Bus Tour which was great, we stayed on it for for the first run around and then got off at the places that we thought would be good to go to.
Best pre book La Sagrada Familia, as it gets booked out quickly.
This is something we didn't organise so unfortunately only got to see the outside.
Definitely 5 days would cover the basicsShow moreBGuest review byBelindaAustralia10.0The streets were beautiful, and I could walk there forever.The streets were beautiful, and I could walk there forever.
There were a lot more homeless people than I expected, felt unsafe at night.
The first thing you should do is book a tour market - you will get a good understanding of the culture and get a sense of how to continue your trip.
Suggest coming to the tourist attraction as early as possible, around 11-13
will be very packed.
Las Ramblas was okay, the trip would be the same without it, really just a packed street, and the whole idea is to fool tourists.
Look for the streets that the locals are going to.
BOOK TICKETS FOR Sagrada Família MONTES IN ADVANCE AND ONLY IN THE MORNING!
In the mall, you have to pay 1.50 euros to use the bathroom.
You should plan where you are going to eat.
For us, it was really overwhelming, having so many options.
For families with young children, I really recommend L'Aquàrium de Barcelona.
Really easy to get around, the last thing you should worry about.Show moreSGuest review bySofi8.0I am a Barcelona FC fan so I am biased.I am a Barcelona FC fan so I am biased. Food was good and I had excellent local spanish wines. If you are young and like to party then it is the place to go.
