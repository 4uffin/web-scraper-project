I would recommend choosing a few places to see if you only have 3-4 days there as it is a large city and things are very spread out. Staying near Sagrada allows you to have time to visit the Basilica and Park Guell easily. While staying in the Gothic Quarter lets you explore that unique area easily and Bacerloneta beach is within a 20 minute walk. I would definitely suggest using public transit if you plan to visit Montjuic as it is very far on foot. If you are going to use cabs then I would suggest the City Cabs instead of Cabify or uber as these are both super slow an arrive an unreliable times which can be stressful for the aiport. Plus the cabify location is really hard to find at the Barcelona airport. There is no need to carry cash with you, everywhere accepts Visa transactions even small groceries and vendors. Keep an eye on your belongings at all times, dont' leave luggage attended and have a hand on your bag and everything will be fine, the city felt very safe!Show moremGuest review bymaggiesutherland86Canada6.0It was late on a very rainy Sunday evening when we arrived,...It was late on a very rainy Sunday evening when we arrived, so we didn't see much at all.

What spoiled it was taxis: prices were wildly inconsistent. A 12 km trip ranged from €28–35 (with traffic) to as high as €60. In a few cases the meter showed ~€28 but I was asked for €45.

Although the hotel is in the quarter Raval and there's street prostitution around the corner, you should not be afraid.
Inside the hotel there's a green courtyard, perfect meeting point, when you travel with groups. And an oasis compared with the noisy streets outside.
