The renowned Prado Museum holds one of the world’s finest art collections with iconic paintings by El Greco, Velázquez and Goya. For a more modern touch, the Museo Reina Sofia houses works by Picasso and Dali. Start your evening at Puerta del Sol, one of the city’s busiest spots. Make some room in your stomach for great tapas and sangria in La Latina district, south of the city’s most famous plaza, Plaza Mayor. Real Madrid plays at Santiago Bernabeu and Atlético Madrid competes at Vicente Calderón Stadium, two opportunities that no sports fan will want to miss.
