The eating and shopping is very good as well. I was mainly doing Anne Frank and WW2 experiences, which were very good and reasonably priced. The most stressful part of being in the centre is to look out for bicycles coming at you from every angle and direction possible - even though I cycled in London for thirty years, the intensity of Amsterdam cycling is much more intense and challenging for pedestrians!Show moreHGuest review byHarmar-Smith10.0The location of the hotel made it easy to visit the Royal...The location of the hotel made it easy to visit the Royal Palace, take a boat trip and walk around the sites restaurants bars and cafes.
