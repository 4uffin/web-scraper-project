There are many beautiful houses along the canals and lots of cosy bridges. Even far from the city centre, where there are more modern buildings, there is a lot of greenery, which gives the city a special charm.

Free Trams, Free Canal Cruises, Free Museums or money off main attractions. Amsterdam has so many varied Museums.
We enjoyed Bodyworks, Mono, and Ripley's the most.

House of Rembrandt is also a must.The marine museum is also a must if you are interested in the colonial history of the Netherlands.
(Allow at least 4 hours).
We wanted to spend a day at the museum of the history of Amsterdam, but sadly it was closed and that was not indicated on their website. So be careful.I would advise taking a canal
trip first to get acquainted with the city. We chose a tour with a small boat and we would recommend such a choice. Live commentaries, no audio guide.Visiting a couple of mansions which had belonged to local merchants is interesting.
