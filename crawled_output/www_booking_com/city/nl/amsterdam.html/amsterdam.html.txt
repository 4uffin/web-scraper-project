We were near the central station and it was easy to get around on the trams. A good way of seeing much of the city is to take Tram line 2 and go for a ride. If you are travelling as a couple you need to credit or debit cards to use the trams, one for each of you which you tap on entering and on leaving the tram. A boat trip on the canals is also must.Show moreJGuest review byJamesColombia8.0There are so many tourists that overtourism feels real.There are so many tourists that overtourism feels real.

The eating and shopping is very good as well. I was mainly doing Anne Frank and WW2 experiences, which were very good and reasonably priced. The most stressful part of being in the centre is to look out for bicycles coming at you from every angle and direction possible - even though I cycled in London for thirty years, the intensity of Amsterdam cycling is much more intense and challenging for pedestrians!Show moreHGuest review byHarmar-Smith10.0The location of the hotel made it easy to visit the Royal...The location of the hotel made it easy to visit the Royal Palace, take a boat trip and walk around the sites restaurants bars and cafes.
