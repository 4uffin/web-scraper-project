The food and coffee at the restaurant were exceptional, with the perk of having a la carte breakfast, lunch and dinner, in case one doesn't book breakfast with the room. Try the mushroom brioche toast from the lunch menu, and the fries - amazing. Very hip cool vibes that attract people, even outside hotel guests. We saw many groups of Dutch people eating there, which is always a good sign.
The room and view from the room over a green Amsterdam channel with water lilies and ducks was just dreamy. The room had everything we needed and was clean. Bottled water is available for guests complimentary. The mini bar also contained complimentary drinks and snacks, which were not replenished every day (is to be expected). The bed was firm and comfortable. Two pillows each with different firmness were provided.
The staff was amazing. The online check-in/check-out process makes it so much faster to get to your room/head out. The hotel staff was kind enough to help us with an issue we had with a taxi they booked for us; the issue was resolved.
The location is great, quiet yet close to a metro station. Away from all the craziness of the city center, which for us was exactly what we wanted. Overall an amazing hotel in Amsterdam.Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.09.0Wonderful - What previous guests thought, 3,876 reviewsWonderful 3,876 reviewsLocation 8.5Price from$158.741 night, 2 adultsCheck availabilitySee all 1193 hotels in AmsterdamHotels with airport shuttles in AmsterdamSee allNH Amsterdam Schiphol AirportHotel in HoofddorpAirport shuttle (free)Scored out of 10, guest rating 8.38.3Very Good -

There are many beautiful houses along the canals and lots of cosy bridges. Even far from the city centre, where there are more modern buildings, there is a lot of greenery, which gives the city a special charm.

(Allow at least 4 hours).
We wanted to spend a day at the museum of the history of Amsterdam, but sadly it was closed and that was not indicated on their website. So be careful.I would advise taking a canal
trip first to get acquainted with the city. We chose a tour with a small boat and we would recommend such a choice. Live commentaries, no audio guide.Visiting a couple of mansions which had belonged to local merchants is interesting.

I have travelled to Amsterdam 6 times in the last 2 years, all in different hotels. This was by far the best location, we didnâ€™t use taxis or public transport once as we were able to walk everywhere. City centre is 5 mins away. Despite this the hotel is situated on a really quiet road on a canal which is beautiful. The staff were amazing giving us recommendations for what is nearby which is always helpful.

Personal at the reception are very informative and attentive.

One more plus of the location - quite area.
