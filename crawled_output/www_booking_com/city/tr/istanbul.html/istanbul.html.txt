The amazing Old Town and the Sultanahmet are home to iconic Blue Mosque and the Hagia Sophia. More history is hidden in the Topkapi Palace, where you can glimpse the splendor and opulence of Turkey’s Ottoman heritage. Take a stroll through the historic center or the busy Taksim Square before watching the sun set behind countless mosques and minarets. Local fish markets and numerous restaurants lining the bridge to Galata offer the Golden Horn’s daily catch. If you prefer the fine art of bargaining to fine art, lose yourself in the Grand Bazar and maybe you’ll emerge with a hookah, some Turkish coffee, or even a carpet. The Spice Bazar further immerses you in the sights, smells, and tastes of Turkish culture. Getting to Istanbul is an easy trip from Ataturk International Airport or Sabiha Gokcen Airport. Whether you want a luxury hotel on the Asian side or a budget hostel in Taksim Square, Booking.com has over 1,000 great accommodations for a vacation in Istanbul.Learn more about visiting Istanbul2607 attractions140 points of interest56 neighborhoodsFind out moreWhat Guests Said About Istanbul:10.0beautiful architecture, a large verity of hotels, activities...beautiful architecture, a large verity of hotels, activities, uber cars are in abundance, very walkable (unless you hate going up hill lol), food is great. prices are great, just an overall good place to be, plan your trip right and you wont run out of things to doShow moreSGuest review bySAMM10.0Istanbul is awesome, and one of my top 5 cities.Istanbul is awesome, and one of my top 5 cities.
But, unfortunately, you must avoid the Tourist Trap of Hagia Sophia.
After fighting the queues, we paid €50 each for entry into what takes 45 minutes to see. despite the 1500 year history, it is only worth €20.

The city was very clean, starting from the airport, the metro, the streets, especially in monumental areas were very well maintained. Nightlife in all important parts of the city was brilliant. I was near Hagia Sofia, a lot of rooftops with parties. I went on the Bosphorus Cruise. I must experience it. I went to Taksim Square and Galata tower parts. Same vibrant night-life. I can also recommend Gulhane Park, and Old Baazar during the day. Marmara sea views were spectacular. Also, a hop-on, hop-off bus is a must for the city exploration with an audio guide. Bosforus bridge is marvelous. Hagia Sofia museum was a nice experience. Hagia Sofia itself was great too. City full of friendly cats. Safety is ok. There were policeman around. The tourist points such as Hagia Sofia, Topkapi palace, Galata tower were a little expensive in my opinion, but maybe because of our fall. The food was good, although there were a lot of tourist traps. There were so many restaurants you could not choose easily. Recommend Hafiz Mustafa for desserts with Turkish tea.Show moreLGuest review byLgjerAlbania10.0Istanbul is a wonderful city to visit.Istanbul is a wonderful city to visit.

Food is fabulous, although prices nowadays are a little steep so plan and prepare properly.
People are very friendly, very safe to walk at night as well, we felt comfortable & safe in all places we visited.
Wear correct footwear when visiting Istanbul, most of the streets in Istanbul are inclined.

One particular improvement could be brought by banning SMOKING IN PUBLIC PLACES. I found every second person smoking anywhere and everywhere, unmindful of social etiquette. I live in Wales , where we are blessed with clean air, it felt that my lungs would choke with smoke in the air as at most places- public benches, passages, shops, walk ways ----people just smoked. As a non smoker I am sure , many like me would welcome regulation of smoking at public spaces.
Overall, the city is much like any tourist attraction giving each one whatever they crave from food to night life to shopping at Misr and Grand Bazar. I found Asian side more reasonable and affordable , infact, Asian side of Istanbul is more European than the European side itself. Istanbul is full of lovely cats that adds to its beauty and locals and tourists adore them alike. The tickets at tourist attractions are quite pricey, cards are confusing (Istanbulkart etc) and one must remain careful how money is spent from food and shopping to transport and visiting important monuments.Show moreAGuest review byArpu10.0If you like a vibrant city that is so different from...If you like a vibrant city that is so different from European cities, Istanbul is the place to go.
