The amazing Old Town and the Sultanahmet are home to iconic Blue Mosque and the Hagia Sophia. More history is hidden in the Topkapi Palace, where you can glimpse the splendor and opulence of Turkey’s Ottoman heritage. Take a stroll through the historic center or the busy Taksim Square before watching the sun set behind countless mosques and minarets. Local fish markets and numerous restaurants lining the bridge to Galata offer the Golden Horn’s daily catch. If you prefer the fine art of bargaining to fine art, lose yourself in the Grand Bazar and maybe you’ll emerge with a hookah, some Turkish coffee, or even a carpet. The Spice Bazar further immerses you in the sights, smells, and tastes of Turkish culture. Getting to Istanbul is an easy trip from Ataturk International Airport or Sabiha Gokcen Airport.

(Some restaurants, not all of them)
However, one downside of my experience was the high number of people smoking, both young and old. It was disheartening to see families smoking around their children, which really polluted the air on the sidewalks and streets.
Do not buy anything from the Grand Bazaar; they target tourists and sell items for 5 to sometimes 10 times their original prices.
