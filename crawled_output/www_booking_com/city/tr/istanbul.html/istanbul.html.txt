The amazing Old Town and the Sultanahmet are home to iconic Blue Mosque and the Hagia Sophia. More history is hidden in the Topkapi Palace, where you can glimpse the splendor and opulence of Turkey’s Ottoman heritage. Take a stroll through the historic center or the busy Taksim Square before watching the sun set behind countless mosques and minarets. Local fish markets and numerous restaurants lining the bridge to Galata offer the Golden Horn’s daily catch. If you prefer the fine art of bargaining to fine art, lose yourself in the Grand Bazar and maybe you’ll emerge with a hookah, some Turkish coffee, or even a carpet. The Spice Bazar further immerses you in the sights, smells, and tastes of Turkish culture. Getting to Istanbul is an easy trip from Ataturk International Airport or Sabiha Gokcen Airport. Whether you want a luxury hotel on the Asian side or a budget hostel in Taksim Square, Booking.com has over 1,000 great accommodations for a vacation in Istanbul.Learn more about visiting Istanbul2604 attractions140 points of interest56 neighborhoodsFind out moreWhat Guests Said About Istanbul:10.0A beautiful city, not dangerous in my opinion considering my...A beautiful city, not dangerous in my opinion considering my "solo" trip as a black girl.

But, unfortunately, you must avoid the Tourist Trap of Hagia Sophia.

The city was very clean, starting from the airport, the metro, the streets, especially in monumental areas were very well maintained. Nightlife in all important parts of the city was brilliant. I was near Hagia Sofia, a lot of rooftops with parties. I went on the Bosphorus Cruise. I must experience it. I went to Taksim Square and Galata tower parts. Same vibrant night-life. I can also recommend Gulhane Park, and Old Baazar during the day. Marmara sea views were spectacular. Also, a hop-on, hop-off bus is a must for the city exploration with an audio guide. Bosforus bridge is marvelous. Hagia Sofia museum was a nice experience. Hagia Sofia itself was great too. City full of friendly cats. Safety is ok. There were policeman around. The tourist points such as Hagia Sofia, Topkapi palace, Galata tower were a little expensive in my opinion, but maybe because of our fall. The food was good, although there were a lot of tourist traps. There were so many restaurants you could not choose easily. Recommend Hafiz Mustafa for desserts with Turkish tea.Show moreLGuest review byLgjerAlbaniaSee reviews by guests who stayed at hotels in IstanbulSee allPoint Hotel TaksimBeyoglu, IstanbulFrom $217.19 per nightScored out of 10, guest rating 8.88.8Excellent - What previous guests thought, 2,449 reviews Excellent · 2,449 reviewsThe hotel exceeded our expectations, the staff were super friendly and they upgraded our room to a suite!
