The amazing Old Town and the Sultanahmet are home to iconic Blue Mosque and the Hagia Sophia. More history is hidden in the Topkapi Palace, where you can glimpse the splendor and opulence of Turkey’s Ottoman heritage. Take a stroll through the historic center or the busy Taksim Square before watching the sun set behind countless mosques and minarets. Local fish markets and numerous restaurants lining the bridge to Galata offer the Golden Horn’s daily catch. If you prefer the fine art of bargaining to fine art, lose yourself in the Grand Bazar and maybe you’ll emerge with a hookah, some Turkish coffee, or even a carpet. The Spice Bazar further immerses you in the sights, smells, and tastes of Turkish culture. Getting to Istanbul is an easy trip from Ataturk International Airport or Sabiha Gokcen Airport. Whether you want a luxury hotel on the Asian side or a budget hostel in Taksim Square, Booking.com has over 1,000 great accommodations for a vacation in Istanbul.Learn more about visiting Istanbul2600 attractions140 points of interest56 neighborhoodsFind out moreWhat Guests Said About Istanbul:10.0Istanbul is a world metropolis that attracts people of...Istanbul is a world metropolis that attracts people of different interests, cultures, and ages.

(Some restaurants, not all of them)
However, one downside of my experience was the high number of people smoking, both young and old. It was disheartening to see families smoking around their children, which really polluted the air on the sidewalks and streets.
Do not buy anything from the Grand Bazaar; they target tourists and sell items for 5 to sometimes 10 times their original prices.

The mosques are incredible, as well as the palaces. The food here is delicious. We used public transportation to move around and it was so easy and safe to use.
