But this is a note of caution....
Everyone uses Grab to get around - and it's so easy.
DO NOT BOOK A TAXI OR A SHUTTLE AT THE AIRPORT!
And definitely DO NOT BOOK THE RETURN TRIP AT THE SAME TIME!!!!
This is a known scam.
We paid MYR230 each way to Bukit Bintang whereas a Grab is under MYR100.
Our return taxi never showed up at the hotel. And after waiting 45 minutes, we had no choice but to book a Grab. Thank you to the hotel staff for helping us.
Our Grab showed up in 30 seconds! And he got us to the airport in 40 minutes which must be a record, and not quite legal. Thank you Samir!
So, use Grab - anyone with a mobile in KL will have the app - and will call one for you.
Hope this saves you being ripped off.Show moreNGuest review byNicolasNew Zealand10.0we spent 2 day in kl,we spent 2 day in kl,
