IIoanaFromIrelandDa am Hotel was exceptional! Location was just perfect, quiet but very close to the bus stop and to the 2 metro stops. Also very close by the Jongno area which is great for going out.
Best part about the location was that the airport shuttle has its stop just 5 mins walks from the hotel. Ticket must be purchased from the airport when coming to Seoul and bought directly from the driver when leaving Seoul. Bus number 6011.
In terms of the hotel itself, I have just good words. Very clean, amazing breakfast, amazing staff, very helpful and very polite. There’s a washing machine and a thumble dryer which are feee of charge. Just a very small amount for the washing liquid.
It is very quiet, hence I don’t recommend it for people who are looking for parties. Towels are changed every day along with a free bottle of water.
There’s also a robe which is provided on the first day.
There’s also a rooftop terrace with an amazing view
and with a smoking corner.
Also, there is a CU store just 1 min walks from the hotel where you can get the Climate Card which is much better than the T Money card.Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.09.0Superb - What previous guests thought, 825 reviewsSuperb 825 reviewsPrice from£68.491 night, 2 adultsCheck availabilityMoxy Seoul MyeongdongHotel in Jung-Gu, SeoulAttractively located in the centre of Seoul, Moxy Seoul Myeongdong features free WiFi, a bar and free private parking for guests who drive.

Linda and her colleague at checking desk was nice and ensure we are happy with the room and reminded us to just call the crew if anything else required.
