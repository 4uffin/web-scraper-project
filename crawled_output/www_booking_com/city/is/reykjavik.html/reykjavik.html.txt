Especially enjoyed drinking water from the tap and not relying on plastic water bottles. Blue Lagoon was a relaxing treat for my whole body.
Also did the 11 hour Golden Circle tour which was fun and educational as was the Reykjavík walking food tour. Definitely try the local pastries as they are delicious. The Volcano Express ride in the Harpa Concert Hall was so much fun and I highly recommend it. The only downside to this trip is how expensive everything is in Iceland.Show moreJGuest review byJaniceUnited States8.0The street shops are colorful and the city provides good...The street shops are colorful and the city provides good vibes with many artistic architectures, sculptures and murals. The biggest shortcoming is the lack of working public WCs.

The city is very walk-able and, if you choose your hotel correctly, very convenient for various tour and City buses.
We spent two days touring and had time to visit the Reykjavik "sights" in 2 evenings and a couple hours the final day. A car is not necessary in the city and it looks like parking would be tight (and probably expensive).Show moreDGuest review byDavidUnited States8.0We spent 10 hours doing the circle which was amazing!We spent 10 hours doing the circle which was amazing!

If you weren't physically fit - a trip to Iceland would change that for sure!
What a beautiful city. Clean and environmental friendly.
Even the public water closets/toilets were clean and well maintained!
We loved all the attractions and history Iceland has to offer. And as they boast - the water from the faucet is ice cold, clean and clear!
The only down side to the city would be for those who need wheelchair access, rollator paths or aren't physically fit. There aren't many areas that can accommodate those needs.
Even at the airport, it isn't very accessible.Show moreJGuest review byJeannineUnited States10.0Friendly city with lots to do and see.Friendly city with lots to do and see. Nice murals on a lot of buildings and interesting art work in various places.
