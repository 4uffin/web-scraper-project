The hotel is located in a beautiful building with all the comforts necessary for a very good stay. Having a little kitchnette adds value to the place, since you can prepare your own (simple) meals and breakfast.

The biggest shortcoming is the lack of working public WCs. We went to two locations shown on google map, the facilities were all closed and not working.Show moreJGuest review byJuan8.0Iceland is expensive, but Reykjavik is a great base location...Iceland is expensive, but Reykjavik is a great base location to explore the Golden Circle and the South Coast.
The city is very walk-able and, if you choose your hotel correctly, very convenient for various tour and City buses.
We spent two days touring and had time to visit the Reykjavik "sights" in 2 evenings and a couple hours the final day. A car is not necessary in the city and it looks like parking would be tight (and probably expensive).Show moreDGuest review byDavidUnited States8.0We spent 10 hours doing the circle which was amazing!We spent 10 hours doing the circle which was amazing!

Best: walking through tectonic plates! Lunch at tomato farm! Geysers! Blue Lagoon! Waterfalls! A wonderful day!

If you weren't physically fit - a trip to Iceland would change that for sure!
What a beautiful city. Clean and environmental friendly.
Even the public water closets/toilets were clean and well maintained!
We loved all the attractions and history Iceland has to offer. And as they boast - the water from the faucet is ice cold, clean and clear!
The only down side to the city would be for those who need wheelchair access, rollator paths or aren't physically fit. There aren't many areas that can accommodate those needs.
Even at the airport, it isn't very accessible.Show moreJGuest review byJeannineUnited States10.0Friendly city with lots to do and see.Friendly city with lots to do and see. Nice murals on a lot of buildings and interesting art work in various places.

Reykjavik itself is a great place to vist. Compact enough to walk around with a great atmosphere. Plenty of food choices and lots to see and do.
Do the 'free walking tour' for great information and to visit parts of the city you may not normally get to.
Outside of Reykjarvik the countryside is just stunning. You must do the Golden Circle including Thingvellir National Park, Geysir, Gullfoss and if you hire a car also go to Kerid Crater.
Also the Blue Lagoon is a must.
