Pretty buildings, great shopping, lots of restaurant choices, etc. We loved going to the pools and it was a good place to start our tour of Iceland. Prepare for expensive restaurant meals, but everywhere we ate was delicious. We enjoyed the whale museum, lava centre, museum of Iceland, and the Perlan (the only northern lights we got to see on our trip!).Show moreKGuest review byKerraCanada10.0My son and I traveled to Iceland for a 5 night vacation,...My son and I traveled to Iceland for a 5 night vacation, staying in Reykjavik for a total of 3 nights.
What a wonderful, safe, friendly city! We stayed downtown in 2 different areas, both walkable to the many museums, restaurants, and shopping districts. Reykjavik is colorful, with buildings and street art abundant. Reykjavik is also expensive, as is all of Iceland, so prepare to spend almost double for food, drink, and gifts as you would in the U.S.
That being said, I loved it, and will be back!Show morewGuest review bywendyUnited States10.0I loved walking around the city and seeing the sites.I loved walking around the city and seeing the sites. Especially enjoyed drinking water from the tap and not relying on plastic water bottles. Blue Lagoon was a relaxing treat for my whole body.
Also did the 11 hour Golden Circle tour which was fun and educational as was the Reykjavík walking food tour. Definitely try the local pastries as they are delicious. The Volcano Express ride in the Harpa Concert Hall was so much fun and I highly recommend it. The only downside to this trip is how expensive everything is in Iceland.Show moreJGuest review byJaniceUnited States8.0The street shops are colorful and the city provides good...The street shops are colorful and the city provides good vibes with many artistic architectures, sculptures and murals. The biggest shortcoming is the lack of working public WCs. We went to two locations shown on google map, the facilities were all closed and not working.Show moreJGuest review byJuan8.0Iceland is expensive, but Reykjavik is a great base location...Iceland is expensive, but Reykjavik is a great base location to explore the Golden Circle and the South Coast.
The city is very walk-able and, if you choose your hotel correctly, very convenient for various tour and City buses.
We spent two days touring and had time to visit the Reykjavik "sights" in 2 evenings and a couple hours the final day. A car is not necessary in the city and it looks like parking would be tight (and probably expensive).Show moreDGuest review byDavidUnited States8.0We spent 10 hours doing the circle which was amazing!We spent 10 hours doing the circle which was amazing! But we only stayed 1 day and by evening we were too tired to enjoy the city
Best: walking through tectonic plates! Lunch at tomato farm! Geysers! Blue Lagoon! Waterfalls! A wonderful day!

The hotel is environmentally friendly.
