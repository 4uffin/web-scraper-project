Don’t forget to stop at Burj Khalifa’s observation deck and admire the city panorama from over 452 metres. Dubai has even more to offer: camel races, hot air balloon flights, fast rides over sand dunes and even snow skiing! Make sure you try local cuisine and visit the Spice Souk, famous for its thousand and one spices. Getting to the city centre from Dubai International and Sharjah International Airports is easy. Whether you’re looking for a stunning luxury hotel, a beachfront suite or an intimate resort, Booking.com has the perfect accommodation for your Dubai adventure.What guests said about Dubai:8.0Just review thoroughly how to get from the airport to the...Just review thoroughly how to get from the airport to the hotel. I thought I could just walk terminal 3 to terminal 1, then walk across the street to hotel. I walk lots of places in Australia. Just get out a map & go. Not in Dubai. The hotel staff were great on arrival, gave me water after such a “trek” to get there via train & hailing that cab. Only had one night stopover. Then go the hotel courtesy bus at 5am back to the airport for my next flight.Show moreLGuest review byLucindaAustralia10.0Dubai is one of the most beautiful cities in the world.Dubai is one of the most beautiful cities in the world.

I wish I was a resident of Dubai.Show moreEGuest review byEl MutasimUnited Arab Emirates8.0I only stayed two days on a transfer from Australia to...I only stayed two days on a transfer from Australia to England, but 3-4 days would be a good length of time to see the main attractions.
Good points- I was a solo female and I felt safe and not uncomfortable at all. I joined a group tour of the souks, which I would recommend for a bit of the culture. The hop on/hop off bus was a great way to see the city highlights in air conditioning! Go to the supermarket on the 6th floor of the Dubai Mall- cheap Dubai chocolate and amazing choice of lunch to take away(think buffet on a cruise and you’ll be somewhere near!)
Bad points- I went in Sept, it was humid and 30’ outside before 7am. Extremely hot and sweaty, not really possible to walk around outside during the day. It’s a very ‘smoggy’ city, high pollution. Zero view from the Burj Khalifa at sunrise due to smog and condensation on windows! Go later in the day. Don’t get the metered taxis at the airport, absolute rip off! Download ‘Careem’ app (works like Uber, but cheaper)Show moreBGuest review byBevUnited Kingdom10.0Dubai is a good and lovely place to visit.Dubai is a good and lovely place to visit. The best time is from October to march. May to September is very hot and even though the rates are very low, if the heat bothers you than travel to this beautiful place as mentioned above. Use the day metro pass to travel around, and the best time would be between 10 am and 4pm as before and after these timings the metro is pretty packed with office goers either going or returning from work. Ofcourse after 8pm one can travel easy too. There are lots of tours that one can do within Dubai or day tours from Dubai. The locals as well as the expatriate community are very friendly. The Big Bus or the Hop On Hop Off Bus Tours is a good way of seeing Dubai.Show moreOGuest review byOLAVOGermany10.0A great experience.A great experience.

Such a beautiful and vibrant city , very organized, clean, and full of amazing things to see and do. There’s always life and energy, both during the day and at night. I would definitely go back and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a mix of modern attractions, cultural experiences, and great hospitality. My favorite place was Jumeirah and Marina and fav restaurant Zuma (japanese) and Massimo’s (italian).
I also enjoyed sipping on some karak tea and paratha at Karak House, with the amazing Burj Khalifa view. The aquarium at Dubai Mall was likewise amazing .

Within a short walk from the hotel you will find the Dubai Mall and the best of Dubai's shopping, food, and activities.

The food was great. The location of the hotel is ok, far away from the Marina Dubai. At Burj and mall you can go by metro, which is a 2-minute walk from the hotel, or taxi, which is cheap. There is a cafeteria nearby with very good desserts, coffee, and sandwiches. Also a nice Lebanese restaurant and a pub.Show moreGGuest review byGabriela BadRomaniaRove La Mer Beach, JumeirahDubaiFrom £143.94 per nightScored out of 10, guest rating 9.09.0Superb - What previous guests thought, 7,451 reviews Superb · 7,451 reviewsWe liked everything.
