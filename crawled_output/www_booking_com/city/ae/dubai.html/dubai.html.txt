Chic yachts call the city‚Äôs upscale marina home, as well as the 30-acre manmade Burj Khalifa Lake and the world's largest dancing Dubai Fountain. With all of this, visitors might momentarily forget they are in a desert. You can relax on a beautiful sandy beach, explore the local souks and their treasures or enjoy a trip to the amazing Dubai Desert. Don‚Äôt forget to stop at Burj Khalifa‚Äôs observation deck and admire the city panorama from nearly 1500 feet. Dubai has even more to offer: camel races, hot air balloon flights, fast rides over sand dunes and even snow skiing! Make sure you try local cuisine and visit the Spice Souk, famous for its thousand and one spices. Getting to the city center from Dubai International and Sharjah International Airports is easy. Whether you‚Äôre looking for a stunning luxury hotel, a beachfront suite or an intimate resort, Booking.com has the perfect place to stay for your Dubai adventure.What Guests Said About Dubai:10.0place was accesible to the metro, and taxis pass infront of...place was accesible to the metro, and taxis pass infront of the hotel. the only problem they have is not giving water in a hotel room, ive never been to a hotel without drinking water. they also need to do more on the cleanliness.Show moreNGuest review byNAKIYEMBA8.0Just review thoroughly how to get from the airport to the...Just review thoroughly how to get from the airport to the hotel. I thought I could just walk terminal 3 to terminal 1, then walk across the street to hotel. I walk lots of places in Australia. Just get out a map & go. Not in Dubai. The hotel staff were great on arrival, gave me water after such a ‚Äútrek‚Äù to get there via train & hailing that cab. Only had one night stopover.

Good points- I was a solo female and I felt safe and not uncomfortable at all. I joined a group tour of the souks, which I would recommend for a bit of the culture. The hop on/hop off bus was a great way to see the city highlights in air conditioning! Go to the supermarket on the 6th floor of the Dubai Mall- cheap Dubai chocolate and amazing choice of lunch to take away(think buffet on a cruise and you‚Äôll be somewhere near!)
Bad points- I went in Sept, it was humid and 30‚Äô outside before 7am. Extremely hot and sweaty, not really possible to walk around outside during the day. It‚Äôs a very ‚Äòsmoggy‚Äô city, high pollution. Zero view from the Burj Khalifa at sunrise due to smog and condensation on windows! Go later in the day. Don‚Äôt get the metered taxis at the airport, absolute rip off!

The best time is from October to march. May to September is very hot and even though the rates are very low, if the heat bothers you than travel to this beautiful place as mentioned above. Use the day metro pass to travel around, and the best time would be between 10 am and 4pm as before and after these timings the metro is pretty packed with office goers either going or returning from work. Ofcourse after 8pm one can travel easy too. There are lots of tours that one can do within Dubai or day tours from Dubai. The locals as well as the expatriate community are very friendly. The Big Bus or the Hop On Hop Off Bus Tours is a good way of seeing Dubai.Show moreOGuest review byOLAVOGermany10.0A great experience.A great experience.

Within a short walk from the hotel you will find the Dubai Mall and the best of Dubai's shopping, food, and activities.

The food was great. The location of the hotel is ok, far away from the Marina Dubai. At Burj and mall you can go by metro, which is a 2-minute walk from the hotel, or taxi, which is cheap. There is a cafeteria nearby with very good desserts, coffee, and sandwiches. Also a nice Lebanese restaurant and a pub.Show moreGGuest review byGabriela BadRomaniaRove La Mer Beach, JumeirahDubaiFrom $194.08 per nightScored out of 10, guest rating 9.09.0Wonderful - What previous guests thought, 7,452 reviews Wonderful¬†¬∑¬†7,452 reviewsWe liked everything.
