With its ultramodern skyscrapers, the artificial archipelago of Palm Islands and the world’s largest shopping mall, Dubai offers something for every taste. Surrounded by a desert, this city is the futuristic gem of the Middle East and the United Arab Emirates. Chic yachts call the city’s upscale marina home, as well as the 30-acre manmade Burj Khalifa Lake and the world's largest dancing Dubai Fountain. With all of this, visitors might momentarily forget they are in a desert. You can relax on a beautiful sandy beach, explore the local souks and their treasures or enjoy a trip to the amazing Dubai Desert. Don’t forget to stop at Burj Khalifa’s observation deck and admire the city panorama from nearly 1500 feet. Dubai has even more to offer: camel races, hot air balloon flights, fast rides over sand dunes and even snow skiing! Make sure you try local cuisine and visit the Spice Souk, famous for its thousand and one spices. Getting to the city center from Dubai International and Sharjah International Airports is easy. Whether you’re looking for a stunning luxury hotel, a beachfront suite or an intimate resort, Booking.com has the perfect place to stay for your Dubai adventure.What Guests Said About Dubai:10.0place was accesible to the metro, and taxis pass infront of...place was accesible to the metro, and taxis pass infront of the hotel. the only problem they have is not giving water in a hotel room, ive never been to a hotel without drinking water. they also need to do more on the cleanliness.Show moreNGuest review byNAKIYEMBA8.0Just review thoroughly how to get from the airport to the...Just review thoroughly how to get from the airport to the hotel. I thought I could just walk terminal 3 to terminal 1, then walk across the street to hotel. I walk lots of places in Australia. Just get out a map & go. Not in Dubai. The hotel staff were great on arrival, gave me water after such a “trek” to get there via train & hailing that cab. Only had one night stopover. Then go the hotel courtesy bus at 5am back to the airport for my next flight.Show moreLGuest review byLucindaAustralia10.0Dubai is one of the most beautiful cities in the world.Dubai is one of the most beautiful cities in the world. It is characterized by elegance, beauty and cleanliness. It is also characterized by high security. It has many entertainment places and several places for excellent shopping. I wish I was a resident of Dubai.Show moreEGuest review byEl MutasimUnited Arab Emirates8.0I only stayed two days on a transfer from Australia to...I only stayed two days on a transfer from Australia to England, but 3-4 days would be a good length of time to see the main attractions.
Good points- I was a solo female and I felt safe and not uncomfortable at all. I joined a group tour of the souks, which I would recommend for a bit of the culture. The hop on/hop off bus was a great way to see the city highlights in air conditioning! Go to the supermarket on the 6th floor of the Dubai Mall- cheap Dubai chocolate and amazing choice of lunch to take away(think buffet on a cruise and you’ll be somewhere near!)
Bad points- I went in Sept, it was humid and 30’ outside before 7am. Extremely hot and sweaty, not really possible to walk around outside during the day. It’s a very ‘smoggy’ city, high pollution. Zero view from the Burj Khalifa at sunrise due to smog and condensation on windows! Go later in the day. Don’t get the metered taxis at the airport, absolute rip off! Download ‘Careem’ app (works like Uber, but cheaper)Show moreBGuest review byBevUnited Kingdom10.0Dubai is a good and lovely place to visit.Dubai is a good and lovely place to visit. The best time is from October to march. May to September is very hot and even though the rates are very low, if the heat bothers you than travel to this beautiful place as mentioned above. Use the day metro pass to travel around, and the best time would be between 10 am and 4pm as before and after these timings the metro is pretty packed with office goers either going or returning from work. Ofcourse after 8pm one can travel easy too. There are lots of tours that one can do within Dubai or day tours from Dubai. The locals as well as the expatriate community are very friendly. The Big Bus or the Hop On Hop Off Bus Tours is a good way of seeing Dubai.Show moreOGuest review byOLAVOGermany10.0A great experience.A great experience.
