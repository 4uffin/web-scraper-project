Donâ€™t forget to stop at Burj Khalifaâ€™s observation deck and admire the city panorama from nearly 1500 feet. Dubai has even more to offer: camel races, hot air balloon flights, fast rides over sand dunes and even snow skiing! Make sure you try local cuisine and visit the Spice Souk, famous for its thousand and one spices. Getting to the city center from Dubai International and Sharjah International Airports is easy. Whether youâ€™re looking for a stunning luxury hotel, a beachfront suite or an intimate resort, Booking.com has the perfect place to stay for your Dubai adventure.What Guests Said About Dubai:10.0Dubai is a good and lovely place to visit.Dubai is a good and lovely place to visit. The best time is from October to march. May to September is very hot and even though the rates are very low, if the heat bothers you than travel to this beautiful place as mentioned above. Use the day metro pass to travel around, and the best time would be between 10 am and 4pm as before and after these timings the metro is pretty packed with office goers either going or returning from work. Ofcourse after 8pm one can travel easy too. There are lots of tours that one can do within Dubai or day tours from Dubai. The locals as well as the expatriate community are very friendly. The Big Bus or the Hop On Hop Off Bus Tours is a good way of seeing Dubai.Show moreOGuest review byOLAVOGermany10.0A great experience.A great experience.

The city is super clean, incredibly well structured and highly organised, which for us is really attractive.
All the malls, public toilets are super-clean and smell fresh. We even seen cleaners cleaning "underneath chairs" in a restaurant.
Dubai is a very well managed place, with stable air-con throughout wherever you go, and dare we say, it feels safe.
The only downside we found was the volume of traffic, which for a popular city that's still on the rise, is understandable. However, if you like super-luxury cars then you wont mind being stuck behind or at the side of one, they are in abundance and they are stunning to see.
Overall - Dubai is a stunning city that has etched into our mind.Show moredGuest review bydaukcachUnited KingdomSee reviews by guests who stayed at hotels in DubaiSee allRadisson Beach Resort Palm JumeirahPalm Jumeirah, DubaiFrom $304.25 per nightScored out of 10, guest rating 8.98.9Excellent - What previous guests thought, 11,044 reviews ExcellentÂ Â·Â 11,044 reviewsthe best rooftop by far than any other in the area, with views over the beach and Marina buildings in the distance, and views towards the Burj Khalifa, the whole roof is rooftop pool / bar / restaurant with sun lounges, and even has jacuzziâ€™s to watch sunset.

Everything is clean and cosy. The view is the best view of Dubai in my opinion.
Perfect location: 20 mins to Marina, Kite beach and Downtown. And if you don't feel like going anywhere, downstairs is a park, carrefour and another great convenience store with everything you need, 10 minutes and you are in the excellent Dubai Hills mall.Show moreAGuest review byAlexanderUnited Arab EmiratesResearch, refine, and make plans for your whole tripCheap hotels in DubaiExplore more great accommodation options in Dubai, starting with cheap hotels.Serviced apartments in DubaiMore great accommodation options for your trip.Apartments in DubaiMore great accommodation options for your trip.Beach Hotels in DubaiMore great accommodation options for your trip.Ibis Hotels in DubaiMore great accommodation options for your trip.Hotels in Abu DhabiDiscover another destination in the United Arab Emirates.Hotels in Al AinTake a look at hotels in Al Ain and explore more of the United Arab Emirates.Hotels in the United Arab EmiratesPack a bigger bag and see more of the country.Hotels near Dubai World Trade CentrePlaces to stay near one of the top places to see.Show more
