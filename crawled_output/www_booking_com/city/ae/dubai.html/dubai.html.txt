With its ultramodern skyscrapers, the artificial archipelago of Palm Islands and the world’s largest shopping mall, Dubai offers something for every taste. Surrounded by a desert, this city is the futuristic gem of the Middle East and the United Arab Emirates. Chic yachts call the city’s upscale marina home, as well as the 30-acre manmade Burj Khalifa Lake and the world's largest dancing Dubai Fountain. With all of this, visitors might momentarily forget they are in a desert. You can relax on a beautiful sandy beach, explore the local souks and their treasures or enjoy a trip to the amazing Dubai Desert. Don’t forget to stop at Burj Khalifa’s observation deck and admire the city panorama from nearly 1500 feet. Dubai has even more to offer: camel races, hot air balloon flights, fast rides over sand dunes and even snow skiing! Make sure you try local cuisine and visit the Spice Souk, famous for its thousand and one spices. Getting to the city center from Dubai International and Sharjah International Airports is easy. Whether you’re looking for a stunning luxury hotel, a beachfront suite or an intimate resort, Booking.com has the perfect place to stay for your Dubai adventure.What Guests Said About Dubai:10.0Great Vacation with excursions throughout Dubai and a Desert...Great Vacation with excursions throughout Dubai and a Desert Safari.

Its architecture is amazing and the infrastructure is phenomenal.
However, it lack a soul, and good authentic restaurants are rather rare. Be prepared to rely on taxis even for short distances.
Unsurprisingly, Dubai is very hot - we visited in October, and the heat was still oppressive.
It is hard tob walk even short distances, but sitting on a pool-side outside terrace is reasonably pleasant after dark.Show moreMGuest review byMichaelUnited Kingdom10.0place was accesible to the metro, and taxis pass infront of...place was accesible to the metro, and taxis pass infront of the hotel. the only problem they have is not giving water in a hotel room, ive never been to a hotel without drinking water. they also need to do more on the cleanliness.Show moreNGuest review byNAKIYEMBA8.0Just review thoroughly how to get from the airport to the...Just review thoroughly how to get from the airport to the hotel. I thought I could just walk terminal 3 to terminal 1, then walk across the street to hotel. I walk lots of places in Australia. Just get out a map & go. Not in Dubai.
