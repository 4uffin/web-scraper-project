They are clean, polite, and dependable. While not the cheapest option, they offer peace of mind, especially from airports or train stations. Avoid unmarked cars.
Book tickets and reservations months, not days, in advance. This is crucial for popular attractions like the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre, or even nice restaurants. Spontaneous visits often mean long queues or disappointment.
Indulge in classic Parisian patisseries. Ladurée for iconic macarons and Angelina for its rich hot chocolate are must-visit experiences. Tip: Reserve a table at Angelina's to skip the long line.
Plan at least 2 days for Disneyland Paris. Book tickets and access to shows you want to see (like the closing fireworks) early. Pro tip: Instead of a full-day Premier Access pass, consider purchasing individual skip-the-line passes for specific rides as needed; this can save up to 70%. The full pass is only worth it if you plan to ride everything multiple times.
Use the Michelin Guide to find great food at fair prices. Look for the "Bib Gourmand" category – it highlights restaurants offering excellent meals for moderate prices, not just the expensive starred ones. Many touristy street-side cafes serve mediocre food.Show moreVGuest review byVitaliiRussia6.0Nice national monuments and museums, transportation is a...Nice national monuments and museums, transportation is a must plan before arrival, airport bus tickets are bought using a QR code. Metro and trams needs a card you buy and reload as needed, no way to pay cash or Google pay on bus or tram/metro, So plan ahead, we didn't enjoy a single coffee made in any Paris cafe, the best coffee for us was from a street vendon round from rue Dr babinskiShow moreTGuest review byTaylor8.0We really enjoyed the city, lots to see and do .We really enjoyed the city, lots to see and do . We pre booked quite a few activities in advance including moulin rouge and the Eiffel Tower
which get super busy and booked up quick .
We booked with get your guide app and had lots to offer.
We used the metro which is really easy to use and purchased a 5
day travel pass at gare du nord when we got off euro star
which was around 75 euros in total.
Just be really weary of pick pockets, my husband got targeted
when we was trying to navigate our cases through barriers by a male who was really smart appearance and his phone was in his front pocket so just make sure you keep belongings close. Lucky he grabbed his hand and managed to stop him.
However this can happen anywhere and it didn't stop us loving the beautiful city.Show moreSGuest review bySarahUnited Kingdom10.0Love seeing all the sites!Love seeing all the sites! Was surprised by the sheer size of the Eiffel Tower (three times the size of Statue of Liberty) Unexpected dirt/gravel "park" that surrounds it left us dusty, you might want to wear sneakers!
Suggest getting to many sites by boat as most are hop on hop off, start early in the day to make the most of this! Many cafes are hit or miss, but one gem was found very near the Eiffel tower. Although each dish was $25 euros and up they did not disappoint including the very delicious pizza and appetizers: Villa Verdi 42 Avenue de SuffrenShow moreKGuest review byKimUnited States8.0Paris is a city that lives in all of our imaginations, often...Paris is a city that lives in all of our imaginations, often portrayed in films and series, and associated with luxury and good taste. The Seine River runs through the city, making it, along with its historic monuments—especially the Eiffel Tower—a magical place that everyone should visit at least once in their lifetime. The city is still romantic and charming.
Despite the changes over the last decade, including an increase in the homeless population, litter, graffiti, and mass tourism, it remains a city worth visiting. However, it needs to be cared for to ensure it stays this way for the long term.Show moreAGuest review byAllan_CBrazil10.0The Parisions were very nice and great to watch their...The Parisions were very nice and great to watch their activity, running, walking and talking.

If you are looking for one of the cheapest hotels in this area and have 5-star expectations, then maybe it is better not to travel to Paris at all—or go to Le Ritz.
I had a wonderful room in the attic, with a very Parisian vibe.

It is far from being a 5-star hotel, but so is your budget, apparently...Show moreLGuest review byLucianFranceParis France Hotel3rd arr., ParisFrom $279.84 per nightScored out of 10, guest rating 8.58.5Very Good - What previous guests thought, 2,038 reviews Very Good · 2,038 reviewsWe had a wonderful stay at Paris France Hotel. The location is superb. Right in the city centre, walking distance to the Louvre (25 min) and just a few steps from two metro lines. The hotel looks lovely. The room was even bigger than expected. We booked a small 2-person room and actually got a 3-pers room! It had a watercooker, some tea and coffee, a closet and a bathroom with a bath. The staff was really friendly and accommodating. Overall excellent choice for Paris.Show moreMGuest review byMarikeNetherlandsKyriad Paris 18 - Porte de Clignancourt - Montmartre18th arr., ParisScored out of 10, guest rating 8.38.3Very Good - What previous guests thought, 5,238 reviews Very Good · 5,238 reviewsThe staff were so friendly and helpful.
The hotel was perfectly located - very close to metro stations, quick and easy to get to stade de france, eurostar and city centre.
The hotel and rooms were spotless and beds very comfortable and it was all for a very reasonable price.
Nice walk to Sacre Coeur and lovely restaurants nearby.
I would definitely recommend and return again.Show moreKGuest review byKathleenUnited KingdomHôtel le Royal Rive Gauche14th arr., ParisFrom $380.96 per nightScored out of 10, guest rating 8.78.7Excellent - What previous guests thought, 1,187 reviews Excellent · 1,187 reviewsRoom was quite big for Paris, nicely decorated, free water and breakfast was a nice touch.
