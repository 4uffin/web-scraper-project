The Seine River runs through the city, making it, along with its historic monuments—especially the Eiffel Tower—a magical place that everyone should visit at least once in their lifetime. The city is still romantic and charming.
Despite the changes over the last decade, including an increase in the homeless population, litter, graffiti, and mass tourism, it remains a city worth visiting. However, it needs to be cared for to ensure it stays this way for the long term.Show moreAGuest review byAllan_CBrazil10.0Our stay was excellent ,Paris was very clean, disappointed...Our stay was excellent ,Paris was very clean, disappointed we didn't stay longer as we didn't manage to see everything.

The Parisians are nice and helpful people; don't believe what they say about them... especially when it comes to Hollywood's movies; case in point: "Emily in Paris" .... see the "Accidental Tourist" instead
:)
The food is great, especially when it comes to bakeries. Stay away from the touristy restaurants if you want to save. Try the typical fast food franchises like McDonald's, and it will do the job
