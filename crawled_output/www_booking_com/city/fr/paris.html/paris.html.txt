We pre booked quite a few activities in advance including moulin rouge and the Eiffel Tower
which get super busy and booked up quick .
We booked with get your guide app and had lots to offer.
We used the metro which is really easy to use and purchased a 5
day travel pass at gare du nord when we got off euro star
which was around 75 euros in total.
Just be really weary of pick pockets, my husband got targeted
when we was trying to navigate our cases through barriers by a male who was really smart appearance and his phone was in his front pocket so just make sure you keep belongings close. Lucky he grabbed his hand and managed to stop him.

Suggest getting to many sites by boat as most are hop on hop off, start early in the day to make the most of this! Many cafes are hit or miss, but one gem was found very near the Eiffel tower.

The Seine River runs through the city, making it, along with its historic monuments—especially the Eiffel Tower—a magical place that everyone should visit at least once in their lifetime. The city is still romantic and charming.
Despite the changes over the last decade, including an increase in the homeless population, litter, graffiti, and mass tourism, it remains a city worth visiting. However, it needs to be cared for to ensure it stays this way for the long term.Show moreAGuest review byAllan_CBrazil10.0The Parisions were very nice and great to watch their...The Parisions were very nice and great to watch their activity, running, walking and talking.

If you are looking for one of the cheapest hotels in this area and have 5-star expectations, then maybe it is better not to travel to Paris at all—or go to Le Ritz.

It is far from being a 5-star hotel, but so is your budget, apparently...Show moreLGuest review byLucianFranceParis France Hotel3rd arr., ParisFrom £207.55 per nightScored out of 10, guest rating 8.58.5Very good - What previous guests thought, 2,044 reviews Very good · 2,044 reviewsWe had a wonderful stay at Paris France Hotel. The location is superb. Right in the city centre, walking distance to the Louvre (25 min) and just a few steps from two metro lines. The hotel looks lovely. The room was even bigger than expected. We booked a small 2-person room and actually got a 3-pers room! It had a watercooker, some tea and coffee, a closet and a bathroom with a bath. The staff was really friendly and accommodating. Overall excellent choice for Paris.Show moreMGuest review byMarikeNetherlandsKyriad Paris 18 - Porte de Clignancourt - Montmartre18th arr., ParisScored out of 10, guest rating 8.38.3Very good - What previous guests thought, 5,238 reviews Very good · 5,238 reviewsThe staff were so friendly and helpful.
The hotel was perfectly located - very close to metro stations, quick and easy to get to stade de france, eurostar and city centre.
The hotel and rooms were spotless and beds very comfortable and it was all for a very reasonable price.
Nice walk to Sacre Coeur and lovely restaurants nearby.
I would definitely recommend and return again.Show moreKGuest review byKathleenUnited KingdomHôtel le Royal Rive Gauche14th arr., ParisFrom £282.55 per nightScored out of 10, guest rating 8.78.7Fabulous - What previous guests thought, 1,186 reviews Fabulous · 1,186 reviewsRoom was quite big for Paris, nicely decorated, free water and breakfast was a nice touch.
