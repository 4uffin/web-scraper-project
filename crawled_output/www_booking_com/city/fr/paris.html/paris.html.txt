The buildings, the streets and of course the iconic landmarks.
We spent nearly 3 days in central Paris and covered, on average 12 miles of walking each day.
We used the metro as our main method to cover distance, slightly more confusing than the London underground and keeping on top of the travel card is a must.
Would love to go again soon, once my feet recover.
Make sure to see the Arc de Triomphe and Eiffel Tower at night. Just to see the lights and streets at dark is something else.Show moreAGuest review byAnonymous10.0Amazing city to visit!Amazing city to visit! We went mainly for the museums and the Moulin Rouge.
We could have spent a month in just the Louvre! It was much larger than we had anticipated. We did spend a full day there. It was quite crowded, but the lines to get in were not too bad. Get advanced entry time. The metro was a learning experience, but very do-able. We never had to use a taxi! There was a strike so one day some of the attractions were closed. The Eiffel Tower was wonderful to see, day and night. The park in it's shadow is a lovely place to spend some time. We recommend taking one day on the Big Bus tour, including the river cruise. Start at noon one day and it's good for 24 hours, so you get 2 days to explore.
We did visit the Moulin Rouge dinner and show.
The food was good, but not exceptional. The show is a must do experience. Historical! Using the Big Bus tour we drove by and had plenty of time to hop off and see the Arch de Triomphe, Notre Dam and others. There is an audio tour that was really informative.Show moreHGuest review byHuckabaaUnited States6.0Paris is very beautiful city. However,it is too crowded.Paris is very beautiful city. However,it is too crowded. And you can not simply try to visit a touristic place randomly without prepurchased ticket.
Also people who are working in museums or airports etc, some of them they are really really rude If you do not speak French! But there are also some which are nice.
As a result, If you are looking for a metropolitan city, If the crowded streets dont bother you, Paris is the one. Also, It is more expensive than the most of the Europe's capitals. So be aware of that before visiting.
Tips for must visit: Versailles, Eiffel Tower,whole city.
Paris is a very big city, so do not expect to finish visiting it in short term!Show moreHGuest review byHazelCyprus10.0We are in Paris for five weeks. we have been here many time...We are in Paris for five weeks. we have been here many time before.
