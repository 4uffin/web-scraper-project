Great hospitality everywhere.Stunning city. Great hospitality everywhere. People are polite, friendly and helpful. The weather is great (I travelled August-September)
The city has everything you need.
Lovely spaces to walk, shop and relax. Must visit Montmartre - it has really good shops, restaurants and close to Sacre Coeur. Obviously can't miss La tour Eiffel.
Great food and a lot of restaurant and bar options in the city. Metros are convenient. Paris is a very walkable city! Lovely croissants and dessert shops everywhere.Show moreNGuest review byNikitaIndia8.0For reliability, use official Parisian taxis like G7.For reliability, use official Parisian taxis like G7. They are clean, polite, and dependable. While not the cheapest option, they offer peace of mind, especially from airports or train stations. Avoid unmarked cars.
Book tickets and reservations months, not days, in advance. This is crucial for popular attractions like the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre, or even nice restaurants. Spontaneous visits often mean long queues or disappointment.
Indulge in classic Parisian patisseries. Ladurée for iconic macarons and Angelina for its rich hot chocolate are must-visit experiences. Tip: Reserve a table at Angelina's to skip the long line.
Plan at least 2 days for Disneyland Paris. Book tickets and access to shows you want to see (like the closing fireworks) early. Pro tip: Instead of a full-day Premier Access pass, consider purchasing individual skip-the-line passes for specific rides as needed; this can save up to 70%. The full pass is only worth it if you plan to ride everything multiple times.
Use the Michelin Guide to find great food at fair prices. Look for the "Bib Gourmand" category – it highlights restaurants offering excellent meals for moderate prices, not just the expensive starred ones. Many touristy street-side cafes serve mediocre food.Show moreVGuest review byVitaliiRussia6.0Nice national monuments and museums, transportation is a...Nice national monuments and museums, transportation is a must plan before arrival, airport bus tickets are bought using a QR code.

We pre booked quite a few activities in advance including moulin rouge and the Eiffel Tower
which get super busy and booked up quick .
We booked with get your guide app and had lots to offer.
We used the metro which is really easy to use and purchased a 5
day travel pass at gare du nord when we got off euro star
which was around 75 euros in total.
Just be really weary of pick pockets, my husband got targeted
when we was trying to navigate our cases through barriers by a male who was really smart appearance and his phone was in his front pocket so just make sure you keep belongings close. Lucky he grabbed his hand and managed to stop him.
However this can happen anywhere and it didn't stop us loving the beautiful city.Show moreSGuest review bySarahUnited Kingdom10.0Love seeing all the sites!Love seeing all the sites! Was surprised by the sheer size of the Eiffel Tower (three times the size of Statue of Liberty) Unexpected dirt/gravel "park" that surrounds it left us dusty, you might want to wear sneakers!
Suggest getting to many sites by boat as most are hop on hop off, start early in the day to make the most of this! Many cafes are hit or miss, but one gem was found very near the Eiffel tower. Although each dish was $25 euros and up they did not disappoint including the very delicious pizza and appetizers: Villa Verdi 42 Avenue de SuffrenShow moreKGuest review byKimUnited States8.0Paris is a city that lives in all of our imaginations, often...Paris is a city that lives in all of our imaginations, often portrayed in films and series, and associated with luxury and good taste. The Seine River runs through the city, making it, along with its historic monuments—especially the Eiffel Tower—a magical place that everyone should visit at least once in their lifetime. The city is still romantic and charming.
Despite the changes over the last decade, including an increase in the homeless population, litter, graffiti, and mass tourism, it remains a city worth visiting. However, it needs to be cared for to ensure it stays this way for the long term.Show moreAGuest review byAllan_CBrazilSee reviews by guests who stayed at hotels in ParisSee allLennon by Avalon Hotel Paris Gare du Nord10th arr., ParisFrom $216.60 per nightScored out of 10, guest rating 7.47.4Good - What previous guests thought, 2,737 reviews Good · 2,737 reviewsThey have upgraded our room to a family room which was nice, they always make up the room everyday, the staff were so helpful as well, there was one staff who has helped us out how to get around paris easily.
