It's great that families have tons of options as far as all-inclusive resorts go.
You can go all out and pay thousands per night, or go on-the-cheap and find a resort that offers subpar food, but still beach-front.
I loved Chichen Itza, the cenotes, and the food.
You can get REALLY great and authentic food if you leave the resort areas and drive to the center of the city.
There's an area that has tons of vendors and the food is insanely good!
I personally don't think I'll ever return to Cancun, as it's not the best for a single gay guy.
Playa Del Carmen would be more my style, as there is more to do for single people.
I think we goofed up in staying around the major resort area of Cancun.
The resorts pretty much control a lot of the coast, except for a little sliver.
It's great for families for sure, but not really for single people.
But the warm waters of the beaches was astounding!
I'm from Southern California and our beaches are freezing, year-round!
I definitely enjoyed myself, as there is much to do, including some world class restaurants.
But I think Puerto Vallarta is more my jam.Show moreAGuest review byAntonioUnited States10.0We stayed I’m Mexico City first, it was so clean.We stayed I’m Mexico City first, it was so clean.

100 degrees and 98% humidity.
I definitely came at the wrong time of the year.
This place is party central; if you're not a partier, I'd suggest staying someplace closer to what you enjoy; if you're a diver, I'd suggest Puerto Vallarta.
If you're into archeology, I'd suggest Playa del Carmen.
But if you're a newlywed and only into partying and booze, this is your place.Show moreJGuest review byJenniferUnited States10.0“It’s a great place to visit, especially if you need dental...“It’s a great place to visit, especially if you need dental care.
