100...Mid-September and the weather was unbelievably awful.
100 degrees and 98% humidity.
I definitely came at the wrong time of the year.
This place is party central; if you're not a partier, I'd suggest staying someplace closer to what you enjoy; if you're a diver, I'd suggest Puerto Vallarta.
If you're into archeology, I'd suggest Playa del Carmen.
But if you're a newlywed and only into partying and booze, this is your place.Show moreJGuest review byJenniferUnited States10.0“It’s a great place to visit, especially if you need dental...“It’s a great place to visit, especially if you need dental care.

We felt safe all the time (with the exception of crossing the streets, due to speed and disregard of pedestrian crossings). The area is very wide, so try to pick your hotel based on your planned
activities. We made four day trips and everything was great, on time pick ups, great content, but most of our stuff was further south so we had 1-3 hour bus rides to get to some of the spots. The crystalline water pics in the review are from our trip to Cozumel. Sunscreen is banned for many activities, so plan accordingly.
