MMarjorieFromMexicoWe absolutely loved our stay here—the room was incredibly cute, spacious, and cozy, with a big, super comfortable king-size bed that made it hard to leave in the morning. The water pressure in the shower was strong and refreshing, the Wi-Fi worked perfectly the entire time, and we really appreciated the little touches that made the space feel special. One of our favorite surprises was the fun mural just outside our window—it added so much character and charm. Overall, it was such a relaxing and enjoyable place to come back to after a day of exploring.Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.39.3Wonderful - What previous guests thought, 37 reviewsWonderful 37 reviewsPrice from$63.701 night, 2 adultsCheck availabilityIxum, Casa Hotel BoutiqueHotel in Downtown Cancun, CancúnConveniently located in Cancún, Ixum, Casa Hotel Boutique provides air-conditioned rooms, an outdoor swimming pool, free WiFi and a garden.

I was skeptical at first reading much negative reviews after I booked the trip and believe me, I was reading alot.
Free transportation was offered from the Hotel but booking.com offered a free ride from the airport to Jungala so I chose that route instead. The communication was with Me Transfer communicating
through Whats
app. Before we landed, I was notified through What's app. This
communication
was with me after I landed, all the way until we saw the driver.This ride went smooth from the Cancun airport to Jungala hotel. When we got to the resort, there was no wait. 1st stop, the bell boy took our bags, 2nd stop, straight to our Hotel where are suitcase followed shortly.( 10 minutes or less ). I'm giving a bit of a long review because of all the negative reviews I read. I want to make sure i write my experience. The suite that I stayed at was Jungala, lobby building. Staff was excellent and pleasant and spoke very well English. Our room was in tip top condition. Shampoo, conditioner, body wash, shower cap, nail file, make up remover,lip moisturizer, bubble bath, bubble oil, scrub, toothbrush, toothpaste, slippers, bathrobe, cheese board, bread, fruits, awaited for our family as we walked in. What a treat!!! (I'm sure I'm missing some amenities in the review).Josephina, Alejandro, Alexia along with the rest of the staff ( were all exceptional). All tranfers with the golf cart was speedy. No wait at all! If we had to wait, it was like 30 seconds. I booked the fiesta all you can eat and that was a great choice. It's a must see. Once at the resort, it was helpful to download the Vidanta app. This tells you what activities are going on daily. Yes, this resort is very big and the directions on the premises from one point to another is a bit confusing at times, but not all the time. There are staff around to ask as well.Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.29.2Wonderful - What previous guests thought, 27 reviewsWonderful 27 reviewsPrice from$6151 night, 2 adultsCheck availabilityVilla Sofia Boutique Hotel - Near Cancun Downtown - Free CancellationHotel in Downtown Cancun, CancúnIn a prime location in the center of Cancún, Villa Sofia Boutique Hotel - Near Cancun Downtown - Free Cancellation provides air-conditioned rooms, an outdoor swimming pool, free WiFi and a garden.

It's great that families have tons of options as far as all-inclusive resorts go.
You can go all out and pay thousands per night, or go on-the-cheap and find a resort that offers subpar food, but still beach-front.
I loved Chichen Itza, the cenotes, and the food.
You can get REALLY great and authentic food if you leave the resort areas and drive to the center of the city.
There's an area that has tons of vendors and the food is insanely good!
I personally don't think I'll ever return to Cancun, as it's not the best for a single gay guy.
Playa Del Carmen would be more my style, as there is more to do for single people.
I think we goofed up in staying around the major resort area of Cancun.
The resorts pretty much control a lot of the coast, except for a little sliver.
It's great for families for sure, but not really for single people.
But the warm waters of the beaches was astounding!
I'm from Southern California and our beaches are freezing, year-round!
I definitely enjoyed myself, as there is much to do, including some world class restaurants.
But I think Puerto Vallarta is more my jam.Show moreAGuest review byAntonioUnited States10.0We stayed I’m Mexico City first, it was so clean.We stayed I’m Mexico City first, it was so clean.

This place is party central; if you're not a partier, I'd suggest staying someplace closer to what you enjoy; if you're a diver, I'd suggest Puerto Vallarta.
If you're into archeology, I'd suggest Playa del Carmen.
