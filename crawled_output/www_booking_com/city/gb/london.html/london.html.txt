It was great. Public transport is easy and everyone is friendly and helpful. I took my phone and purse on a cross body strap and felt very safe walking about with this.

Have used a car and buses but car parking and everything as a whole is too expensive. The speed bumps are so high, i had to put only one wheel on them otherwise they scrapped the craddle, parkings on each side of the road reduce the width to something quite narrow and it is quit difficult to keep the 20mph limit. Did not find a typical English restaurant or any fish and chips vans or any genuine baker shop. We went to a fish and chip restaurant in Portobello road served by Indians that did not have the real fish and chip taste and came out with a horrible smell of fish on the clothes. On the other hand i still love the town, its monuments and the peaceful parks.Show morePGuest review byPhilippeFrance10.0It's best to be organised when you come to London.It's best to be organised when you come to London.

If Alexandra palace were a bit closer, i think it were world famous. About museums, sure, British Museum is nice, but i loved Victoria and Albert Museum even better and Wallace museum is cool too. They are still not so well-known. You cannot finish this city in four days, sometimes must go back. And i like their fast, effective common traffic, i mean mostly metro and overground.Show moreDGuest review byDavidHungary10.0This city is a vibe!This city is a vibe! A lot to see, a lot to do especially when the weather is good ;-) Churchill's war rooms and the Imperial War Museum are worth a visit when it's raining. But get your ticket for the Churchill Museum online so you don't have to wait too long. Next to Churchill's war rooms is St James' Park - a beautiful park with lots of birds (even budgies) and squirrels. Some of London's most popular sights are around the corner e.g. Westminster Abbey, Big Ben, or of course Buckingham Palace. If you like to go for a nice walk you can also choose hide park (bigger) orHighgate cementery, which is a really beautiful and old cemetery a bit outside of the city. If you are lucky (like me) a fox and some squirrels will cross your way ;-) I stayed near Notting Hill which is a beautiful area. You can stroll through Portobello Road market but I found it a bit overrated (dito Borough Market and Camden Market) or have a brunch at Farm Girl or the Shed - which is also a damn good option for dinner. Or you can book a table at Ottolenghi's - which is a pretty delicious option for dinner too if you can't stand fish and chips anymore. Harrods is also worth a visit eapecially the food corner ;-)Show moreJGuest review byJ.
