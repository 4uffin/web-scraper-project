Every corner is a surprise.
This is my third trip to London and
it keeps surprising me.
My advise is to take it leisurely.
A longer stay or keep returning and experiencing something new each trip.
There are so many experiences to be discovered.
The food is amazing! with the varieties of different cultures.
Each area is a welcome surprise.
But I have to warn people about how expensive it is especially for the solo travelers.
I would go back anyway.Show moreJGuest review byJoseUnited States6.0The trains weee expensive and it seemed like they would...The trains weee expensive and it seemed like they would charge mad prices if you book a ticket but needed to change the time when you were there they would charge huge price differences .
