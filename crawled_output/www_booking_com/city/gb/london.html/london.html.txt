A lot to see, a lot to do especially when the weather is good ;-) Churchill's war rooms and the Imperial War Museum are worth a visit when it's raining. But get your ticket for the Churchill Museum online so you don't have to wait too long. Next to Churchill's war rooms is St James' Park - a beautiful park with lots of birds (even budgies) and squirrels. Some of London's most popular sights are around the corner e.g. Westminster Abbey, Big Ben, or of course Buckingham Palace. If you like to go for a nice walk you can also choose hide park (bigger) orHighgate cementery, which is a really beautiful and old cemetery a bit outside of the city. If you are lucky (like me) a fox and some squirrels will cross your way ;-) I stayed near Notting Hill which is a beautiful area. You can stroll through Portobello Road market but I found it a bit overrated (dito Borough Market and Camden Market) or have a brunch at Farm Girl or the Shed - which is also a damn good option for dinner. Or you can book a table at Ottolenghi's - which is a pretty delicious option for dinner too if you can't stand fish and chips anymore. Harrods is also worth a visit eapecially the food corner ;-)Show moreJGuest review byJ.
