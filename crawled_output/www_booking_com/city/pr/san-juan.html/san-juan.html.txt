Old San Juan was so very beautiful. The preserved history, the knowledgeable tour guides and the quaint cobbled streets.
Another plus was the free pick up and drop off bus that worked inside Old San Juan. FANTASTIC!
I mostly got take out at the Chinese Food places. It was good.

La Lechonera original in Guavate offers delicious fresh food at reasonable prices if you enjoy pig roast, ribs, tamale and plantains. Visited Culebra get tickets online via Puerto Rico ferry. If sold out online, limited tickets are available in person same day if you get there before 8am. Ceiba Ferry Boarding process is very organized and efficient.

It wasn't expensive to go sightseeing and get into places like El Morro. We opted to go on our own since you can Uber/Taxi anywhere at a reasonable price.

It is such a amazing city and has SO much to offer. Everything from the nature, to the old town, to the infinite number of beaches -
I could have stayed for a month. Puerto Rico's culture is lovely and the people friendly even if you don't speak Spanish. The people of Puerto Rico are proud of their Island and will be happy to share their recommendations. I went as a female solo-traveler and felt safer than I do on a normal day in NYC. I would recommend branching out from the gentrified tourist areas such as Condado and go to more local restaurants, kiosks and beaches to get a sense of the real culture. I loved Pinones beach for example, which also has great food and many locals go swim here. I would also recommend visiting Culebra. Talk to your Uber drivers and/or other locals – they are proud of their island and will happily share the most beautiful gems with you. Lastly, don't leave without trying MOFONGO at least once. So delicious. Overall, I'm so impressed with this place and want to see more of this beautiful island.Show moreAGuest review byAnonymousSee reviews by guests who stayed at hotels in San JuanSee allDreams MiramarSanturce, San JuanFrom $261.98 per nightScored out of 10, guest rating 7.57.5Good - What previous guests thought, 428 reviews Good · 428 reviewsThe room was clean.
