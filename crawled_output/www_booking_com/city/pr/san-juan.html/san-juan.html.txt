RRadekFromCzech RepublicWe definitely enjoyed our stay! Especially the connection to the nature - chilling at the terrace in the presence of small green lizards, falling asleep with sounds of coquís (in the first night we thought it was a parrot!), cozy common areas with all the flowers- La Botanica is anything but an ordinary, dull and monotone hotel, it is a real hidden gem. We loved the outdoor shower, coffee and water in the lobby, friendly stuff and primarily the LOCATION! It’s just 150 meters to the beach, 10 minutes to the airport by taking UBER and it’s a real pleasure to go for a morning run just by leaving the house and run! No obstacles, no crossing any traffic, just join another runners on the street.Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.29.2Superb - What previous guests thought, 175 reviewsSuperb 175 reviewsLocation 9.3Price from£163.631 night, 2 adultsCheck availabilityAloft San JuanHotel in Santurce, San JuanSet in San Juan and with Condado Beach reachable within 1.4 km, Aloft San Juan features concierge services, non-smoking rooms, free bikes, free WiFi and a terrace.

Old San Juan was so very beautiful. The preserved history, the knowledgeable tour guides and the quaint cobbled streets.
Another plus was the free pick up and drop off bus that worked inside Old San Juan. FANTASTIC!
I mostly got take out at the Chinese Food places. It was good.

La Lechonera original in Guavate offers delicious fresh food at reasonable prices if you enjoy pig roast, ribs, tamale and plantains. Visited Culebra get tickets online via Puerto Rico ferry.

It wasn't expensive to go sightseeing and get into places like El Morro. We opted to go on our own since you can Uber/Taxi anywhere at a reasonable price.

Definitely, returning but this time hit the more localized restaurants.Show moreBGuest review byBarbaraUnited States10.0I am a newfound fan of San Juan and will definitely come...I am a newfound fan of San Juan and will definitely come back. It is such a amazing city and has SO much to offer. Everything from the nature, to the old town, to the infinite number of beaches -
I could have stayed for a month. Puerto Rico's culture is lovely and the people friendly even if you don't speak Spanish. The people of Puerto Rico are proud of their Island and will be happy to share their recommendations. I went as a female solo-traveler and felt safer than I do on a normal day in NYC. I would recommend branching out from the gentrified tourist areas such as Condado and go to more local restaurants, kiosks and beaches to get a sense of the real culture. I loved Pinones beach for example, which also has great food and many locals go swim here. I would also recommend visiting Culebra. Talk to your Uber drivers and/or other locals – they are proud of their island and will happily share the most beautiful gems with you. Lastly, don't leave without trying MOFONGO at least once. So delicious. Overall, I'm so impressed with this place and want to see more of this beautiful island.Show moreAGuest review byAnonymousSee reviews by guests who stayed at hotels in San JuanSee allVilla Herencia HotelOld San Juan, San JuanFrom £120.57 per nightScored out of 10, guest rating 8.68.6Fabulous - What previous guests thought, 255 reviews Fabulous · 255 reviewsThe hotel is absolutely stunning, and the photos truly reflect the reality of the place.
