SShaiu MeiFromAustraliaIt was actually a transit for a (full) day in Rome. Instead of booking a hotel near FCO which was more expensive than this room rate, and not forget about the expensive fare for airport pick up+ drop off. I was extremely happy and satisfied with my last night staying in Rome. Such a beautiful fine hotel, the room is super clean, there is a garden in the property where I could do my exercise in the morning then head to hotel breakfast, warm and helpful hotel staff. The location looks far from FCO but it is actually very convenient to get there. If you travel light, just take the Leonardo Express direct train from FCO (€15) to Roma termini, hop on Bus 82 right in front of the termini, and a short walking distance you will reach the hotel. If you travel with big luggage bags, I chose to ride
the taxi/uber from the hotel to Roma termini to the airport the next day. The taxi ride cost me €15.50.
As for last night in Rome, I was happy l could enjoy a nice Cacciò e Peppe and delicious pizza at Mamma Pizza by just walking distance before leaving Italia.Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.09.0Wonderful - What previous guests thought, 1,272 reviewsWonderful 1,272 reviewsLocation 9.0Price from$181.901 night, 2 adultsCheck availabilityResidenza Piranesi Boutique HotelHotel in Spagna, RomeWell set in the center of Rome, Residenza Piranesi Boutique Hotel provides continental breakfast and free WiFi throughout the property.

We found reasonable parking lot (@€11 for 3-4 hours near Spanish Steps) and took our own 'unguided' tour and still saw quite a bit.... but would need at least a week to see most everything.
VERY crowded (Sep 17).
Cost of some souvenir places were surprisingly reasonable. Everything else was generally VERY expensive (do NOT go to Gelateria Del Pantheon for gelato....it was €15 for 2 medium sized scoops!).

Needs to see it in your own eyes to appreciate the 2000 years and more of structures survived to tell the world their stories
Easy bus/train transportation to move around, cost 1.50 euro for 100 minutes from the first activation.
Cash needed to buy transmission tickets at cigarettes kiosks around the city.
Bring your reusable water bottle as there are free tasty clean water to fill your bottle around the city.
Cannot express in words the beauty of Rome as to offer
I've been for my first time for 2 1/2 days and managed to view 95% of all the main attractions and taste about 80% of local dishes and pastries.
Definitely will come back for more, enjoyed every minute of it and walked daily average of 20,000 steps
