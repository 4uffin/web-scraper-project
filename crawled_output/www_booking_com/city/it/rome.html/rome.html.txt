EEvgeniiFromArmeniaWe have chosen Umiltà 36 for our vacation in Rome and our stay was amazing. This hotel is located in the very heart of Rome - just a few minutes from the Trevi fountain - but hidden on a quiet street, which makes it a true gem.
Our room was not only beautifully decorated, but also thoughtfully and smartly designed, the bed and pillows were exceptionally comfortable and there was no noise from outside in the room.
The hotel restaurant “Aquamarina” has a great seafood menu with local dishes and wine.
What makes Umiltà 36 really special, however, is the people. Every staff member we’ve interacted with was friendly and genuinely helpful. And what is most important, during our stay our little daughter was treated like a princess - which meant the world to us.Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.69.6Exceptional - What previous guests thought, 2,050 reviewsExceptional 2,050 reviewsPrice from$896.501 night, 2 adultsCheck availabilityH10 Palazzo GallaHotel in Trevi, RomeLocated in Rome, a 5-minute walk from Quirinale Palace, H10 Palazzo Galla provides accommodations with a shared lounge, private parking, a terrace and a bar.

We did a moonlight walking tour the first night through Get Your Guide which helped us get a flavour. We loved the forum and Palatine Hill and the Vatican Museums. Leave plenty of time to do Forum as last entry is 5.30 on a lot of it and the whole area is vast. Recommend skip the line tickets at Vatican museums as the queue was huge. The buses round town are great. If you have a European passport and are under 25 yrs bring it everywhere as there are significant discounts on all entry to sites and museums with thisShow moreAGuest review byAnne-Marie8.0Rome never ceases to amaze always lots to see and pleaces to...Rome never ceases to amaze always lots to see and pleaces to eat.

I was robbed just few hours upon entering Termini,left without cellphone and cent. Even the police are rude. As a history buff I was in awe of the remnants of the Coliseum,Palatine hills, the Past.
Amazed of the wealth of the Vatican, gaped at the
architectural masterpiece and arts in their museum, the unparalled Sistine chapel, and must spend more time inside St Peters Basilica to marvel at everything inside.

To see the history of the past so
mingled with modern civilization is amazing. When it comes to food there’s so many options. It’s such a melting pot of authentic food, there’s something for everyone, Roman, Indian, Chinese, Irish, you think of it it’s there. Getting around is really easy as well taxis, bus, train, uber. You have many options but waking is the easiest, it took us an average of no more than 20 minutes to get to most of the places we visited walking. It’s hot tho so make sure you bring a towel to wipe your sweat if you do decide to walk everywhere. I personally fell that Rome isn’t really a kid friendly location, we didn’t
really see anything geared toward young children and I’m talking 2-17 age range. I don’t believe that demographic would enjoy it. But If you ever decide to go 10 out of 10 would recommend.Show moreAGuest review byAnonymous10.0Rome is one of the best cities in the world.Rome is one of the best cities in the world.

What a nice little hotel. Our room on the 4th floor had a small terrace. We liked the fact that there were several mirrors of good size in the room. It was hot in Rome during our stay, but AC, comfortable beds, and the lack of disturbing noise made sure we slept well.

It's small, but so are most hotels in Rome. We've stayed in a few different places in Rome, and this was our favorite. It's also close to Termini without being TOO close, which gets a little grimy.Show moreJGuest review byJaysonCanadaResearch, refine, and make plans for your whole tripHotels near Roma TerminiBook a hotel close to Roma Termini, perfect for easy access to local transit links.Cheap vacations in RomeBook the best flights, stays, and more – all in one placeThings to do in RomeHow will you spend your time in the city?Hotels in LazioExtend your search and explore the surrounding area.When to visit ItalyEvents, prices, weather, and more.Hotels near Nuova Fiera di RomaHotels close to a popular local landmark.Hotels near Parco Leonardo Shopping MallSearch and compare hotels close to Parco Leonardo Shopping Mall, a popular destination just outside Rome.Flights from New York to RomeFind and compare the best flights.Hotels near The VaticanPlaces to stay near one of the top places to see.Show more
