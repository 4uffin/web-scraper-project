EEvgeniiFromArmeniaWe have chosen Umiltà 36 for our vacation in Rome and our stay was amazing. This hotel is located in the very heart of Rome - just a few minutes from the Trevi fountain - but hidden on a quiet street, which makes it a true gem.
Our room was not only beautifully decorated, but also thoughtfully and smartly designed, the bed and pillows were exceptionally comfortable and there was no noise from outside in the room.
The hotel restaurant “Aquamarina” has a great seafood menu with local dishes and wine.
What makes Umiltà 36 really special, however, is the people. Every staff member we’ve interacted with was friendly and genuinely helpful. And what is most important, during our stay our little daughter was treated like a princess - which meant the world to us.Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.69.6Exceptional - What previous guests thought, 2,043 reviewsExceptional 2,043 reviewsPrice from$892.511 night, 2 adultsCheck availabilityH10 Palazzo GallaHotel in Trevi, RomeLocated in Rome, a 5-minute walk from Quirinale Palace, H10 Palazzo Galla provides accommodations with a shared lounge, private parking, a terrace and a bar.

But it's soooooo crowded.
No place like Rome - it's on the fabulous, European culture icon city mountain-top with Paris and Florence (maybe add Venice and old Athens?)
The architecture, the history, the vibe and boy oh boy, the food...
But even in September it feels like the most prevalent experience is people management. The crowds are unbelievable, as are the lines - and the amounts of cell phones and selfies.Show moreFGuest review byFritzFrance8.0Good trip, good stay, good food, good public transportation,...Good trip, good stay, good food, good public transportation, friendly people.

If you are out on the streets as early as possible, you will have the opportunity to truly enjoy the beauty of the Trevi Fountain without being constantly nudged by other tourists. Every church is beautiful.
⚠️ Warning — Always Google every restaurant on Google Maps and check the reviews! AVOID Ristorante Pizzeria Al Piacere. They pretend to offer you food to taste as if it is free of charge, and then they charge you for each individual item on the plate. Before you know it, the bill for two comes to over €300. They also do not bring you what you ask for and pretend not to understand what you are saying. They rely on tourists not arguing — they are conmen.Show moreJGuest review byJulianbelleUnited Kingdom10.0So much to see, at least 5 days needed to scratch the...So much to see, at least 5 days needed to scratch the surface. We did a moonlight walking tour the first night through Get Your Guide which helped us get a flavour. We loved the forum and Palatine Hill and the Vatican Museums. Leave plenty of time to do Forum as last entry is 5.30 on a lot of it and the whole area is vast. Recommend skip the line tickets at Vatican museums as the queue was huge. The buses round town are great. If you have a European passport and are under 25 yrs bring it everywhere as there are significant discounts on all entry to sites and museums with thisShow moreAGuest review byAnne-Marie8.0Rome never ceases to amaze always lots to see and pleaces to...Rome never ceases to amaze always lots to see and pleaces to eat.

I was robbed just few hours upon entering Termini,left without cellphone and cent. Even the police are rude. As a history buff I was in awe of the remnants of the Coliseum,Palatine hills, the Past.
Amazed of the wealth of the Vatican, gaped at the
architectural masterpiece and arts in their museum, the unparalled Sistine chapel, and must spend more time inside St Peters Basilica to marvel at everything inside.

We stayed 3 nights and then returned for another 4 nights after traveling to the Cinque Terre region of Italy.
The hotel was in a perfect location - the Aventino area is quiet, green, and about a 15 minute walk from the busy sights of Rome.
(It is up a hill so be aware of that.)
Our room (#830) was beautiful with a huge patio.

The room was in excellent condition and the hotel is in a perfect location. A bonus is that if you’re walking
in to the city centre, you will walk past the most amazing Gelateria, Guttilla (definitely worth a try!) We will definitely be coming back and staying at Guest’s heaven if we are going back to Rome!Show moreAGuest review byAngelicaIrelandB&B TerminiCentral Station, RomeFrom $210.33 per nightScored out of 10, guest rating 5.35.3Fair - What previous guests thought, 153 reviews Fair · 153 reviewsWith my long association with Booking.com, this is the first time I felt let down. I was forced to like the stay, as I had booked for eight nights at this hotel, to use Rome as the base of my travel around Italy. The only thing I liked was the proximity of the hotel to Roma Termini train station.Show moreLGuest review byLAKSHMINARAYANIndiaResearch, refine, and make plans for your whole tripCar rental in RomeRent a car and hit the road, whether it's to go from A to B or for a longer road trip.Hotels in LazioExtend your search and explore the surrounding area.Hotels in NaplesTry another destination popular with our guests.Hotels in VeniceTry another destination popular with our guests.Hotels near Fiumicino AirportPerfect for a late arrival or early departure.Hotels near Rome Ciampino AirportPerfect for a late arrival or early departure.Flights from New York to RomeFind and compare the best flights for your trip to Rome right here on Booking.com.Cheap vacations in RomeBook the best flights, stays, and more – all in one placeHotels in MilanDiscover another destination in Italy.Show more
