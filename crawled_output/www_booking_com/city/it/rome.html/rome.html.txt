We found reasonable parking lot (@€11 for 3-4 hours near Spanish Steps) and took our own 'unguided' tour and still saw quite a bit.... but would need at least a week to see most everything.
VERY crowded (Sep 17).
Cost of some souvenir places were surprisingly reasonable. Everything else was generally VERY expensive (do NOT go to Gelateria Del Pantheon for gelato....it was €15 for 2 medium sized scoops!).

It's my favorite part of Rome and the hotel is so convenient and easily accessible..
The staff were all friendly and really helpful. The breakfast was excellent and I loved being able to have a cappucino made for me (rather than out of a machine like many other "included" breakfasts I've had in italy). Having a kettle in the room was a nice surprise as well. This will be my 'go to" hotel in Rome from now on!Show moreCGuest review byCarolUnited StatesResearch, refine and make plans for your whole tripCar hire in RomeHire a car and hit the road, whether that's A to B or for a longer road trip.Hotels in CiampinoFind more hotels in a city close to Ciampino.Hotels in FrascatiFind more hotels in a city close to Frascati.Flights to RomeFind and compare prices for this popular flight route.Things to do in RomeHow will you spend your time in the city?Hotels near Fiumicino AirportPerfect for a late arrival or early departure.Hotels near Rome Ciampino AirportGot a stopover, late arrival or early departure?
