So much history and beautiful sights to see. Wonderful food (especially if you follow the locals or get off the beaten path). We always feel like we could spend 4-6 days there just learning about everything. We especially love riding Lime scooters around the city early in the morning before the crowds are awake or late at night when there is less traffic.Show moreLGuest review byLeahUnited States10.0It's an amazing city for people who enjoy history and art,...It's an amazing city for people who enjoy history and art, so I'm deffinitely visiting Rome again in the future. There's too much to see in only 1 week, but if you stay longer you risk getting overwhelmed. I suppose 1 week at a time, and visiting 2 to 3 locations per day maximum is the ideal length. I believe going during summer was a mistake, as it was too hot and sunny and many locations have very little shade (such as the coliseum). I would recommend visiting during spring or fall. The metro is very affordable, reliable and practical to use for turists, so I recommend using the "tap and go" option. The food is good, but I would not recommend only eating pizza, pasta, bread, etc, for a week, my stomach doesn't approve of it, nor my bowel. I suggest 1 day eating out and next day buying vegetables/fruit and chicken/fish and eating in. So you can feel healty and energised the entire trip.Show moreAGuest review byAnaUnited Kingdom8.0Magnificent!Magnificent!

We found reasonable parking lot (@€11 for 3-4 hours near Spanish Steps) and took our own 'unguided' tour and still saw quite a bit.... but would need at least a week to see most everything.
VERY crowded (Sep 17).
Cost of some souvenir places were surprisingly reasonable. Everything else was generally VERY expensive (do NOT go to Gelateria Del Pantheon for gelato....it was €15 for 2 medium sized scoops!).

The breakfast was excellent and I loved being able to have a cappucino made for me (rather than out of a machine like many other "included" breakfasts I've had in italy). Having a kettle in the room was a nice surprise as well.
