JJayne-MarieFromAustraliaThe staff at this hotel made all the difference during my stay, and I can‚Äôt thank them enough. I was critically ill, rushed by ambulance three times due to severe acute dyspnea and bronchial asthma. I believe the golden sands from the Gobi Desert, which blew in just as I left Australia, carried allergens that triggered my attacks. I couldn‚Äôt even step outside without risking my life.
It‚Äôs now day 22, and only three days ago my travel insurance finally approved my hospitalization. Until then, I was fighting for my life without the IV drips, treatments, or medical care I so desperately needed. This delay has caused further health complications. I've been xrayed, heart monitors, intravenius drugs and antibiotics, risk of diagetes, osteoporosis, had fevers, infections from being left so long to get travel insurance support, overdoses of steroids while trying to stay alive for 17 days in a makeshift hotel hospital, plus more. I won't be able to work for awhile, and it will take time to recover, and I'm a full time Australian teacher.
Today is the first day I feel strong enough to write and know that I will make it home alive. I‚Äôll be escorted back by a nurse in first class, lying down with oxygen, nebulizers, sedation, and IV drips. They'll reassess me in two days, and I hope to fly home within the week.
AMAZING STAFF AT ALOFT OSAKA üôèüíï
The amazing staff at Osaka ALOFT kept me going. From the moment I arrived, they went out of their way to help. Roberto, seeing my hands shaking from the medications after my first ambulance trip, would bring me cereal and coffee when I couldn‚Äôt hold them myself. The reception staff booked ambulances, called hospitals, checked on me, and brought me whatever I needed. They were not just servicing me. They genuinely cared.
Rajika, a lovely Sri Lankan woman, insisted on calling that first ambulance when I had my first attack.

This is symbolised in its temple-like, 16th century castle, guarded by ramparts and enlivened by vibrant spring cherry blossom. Dominating the surrounding skyline is Osaka Business Park, a reminder of the city‚Äôs strong role in the Japanese economy. However, the most striking skyscraper is the Umeda Sky Building - 2 towers connected by a rooftop terrace offering far-reaching views. The nearby Osaka and Umeda train stations are linked by underground shopping centres, while the shops of Shinsaibashi‚Äôs America Village appeal to a younger crowd. D≈çtonbori‚Äôs neon lights promote more shops, as well as restaurants considered the best in Osaka. In a city touted as Japan‚Äôs culinary capital, that‚Äôs quite an accolade.The Ts≈´tenkaku tower overlooks Tenn≈çji Park, home of the Osaka Municipal Museum of Art. Another nearby park houses Shitenn≈ç-ji, one of Japan‚Äôs oldest Buddhist temples. The Kyocera Dome Osaka is a shrine of baseball, and more thrills are at waterfront Universal Studios Japan, the country‚Äôs 2nd largest theme park. Also by the sea is Kansai International Airport, on its own artificial island.The capsule hotel was invented in Osaka, and alongside this type of accommodation, Booking.com also offers luxury hotels with pools, cheap hostels and traditional ryokans.Learn more about visiting Osaka866 attractions356 points of interest32 neighborhoodsFind out moreWhat Guests Said About Osaka:10.0If you're ever going to Japan, do yourself a favour and...If you're ever going to Japan, do yourself a favour and don't stick around in Tokyo's tourist traps, Kansai is where it's at, great food, friendly people, you can just about vibe anywhere you goShow moreSGuest review bySrdjanSerbia8.0We went to have dinner with a local resident, a friend.We went to have dinner with a local resident, a friend.
