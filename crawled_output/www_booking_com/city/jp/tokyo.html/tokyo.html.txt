DDidemFromTurkeyIt was sooooo good! I have never stayed in a cleaner hotel, it was pristine! The bed was super comfy and the TV had streaming services and lots of channel options. I liked the marble surfaces in the room with the wood parts, it was really chic and fancy! And BREAKFAST!! It was to die for, so many options both Japanese and western. I just kept getting up getting more to my plate. Also the little notes next to the foods were really helpful, especially if you are interested in the Japanese cuisine. All in all we liked it so much that we came back stayed for another night at the end of our trip. It is also very close to the airport, just one stop and the subway station is literally in front of the hotel. There is also a pharmacy and currency exchange atm and coffee shop nearby (2-3 minutes) walking distance.Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.19.1Wonderful - What previous guests thought, 4,600 reviewsWonderful 4,600 reviewsPrice from$146.081 night, 2 adultsCheck availabilityMercure Tokyo Haneda AirportHotel in Ota Ward, TokyoLocated in Tokyo, 1.1 miles from Uramori Inari Shrine, Mercure Tokyo Haneda Airport provides accommodations with a fitness center, private parking, a restaurant and a bar.

It’s so huge that you’ll have to come to grips with public transport and maybe even experience being pushed onto a train. Yes, it does actually happen!Get your bearings by ascending the Tokyo World Trade Center near the waterfront, and savor the fantastic views taking in the red-and-white Tokyo Tower and Shinkuju’s skyscrapers. North is Ueno, home to the best museums (including the Tokyo National Museum) and a large park bursting with cherry blossom in spring.Equally tranquil are the Chiyoda Imperial Palace and Gardens, surrounded by water. Also in gardens is the Meiji Jingu Shinto shrine in Shibuya, a youthful district where neon abounds.For more traditional Japanese culture, head to Asakusa whose Sensō-ji Buddhist temple is Tokyo’s oldest temple. Outdoor markets sell a variety of wares, though shopping in Tokyo is, of course, fantastic wherever you go.Whether you stay in a Japanese ryokan, luxury Tokyo hotel or a hostel, don’t fly out of Tokyo Narita Airport or Haneda Airport without having tried sushi. Another Japanese institution is the sento (public bath) and onsen (hot springs bath) – a must try. Also incredibly popular are Tokyo Disneyland and Tokyo DisneySea, Asia’s 2 most visited theme parks.Learn more about visiting Tokyo2079 attractions1747 points of interest61 neighborhoodsFind out moreWhat Guests Said About Tokyo:10.0Tokyo is an incredible place to go.Tokyo is an incredible place to go. Loved the friendly people, very safe, beautiful vibrant city. Enjoyed the tasty food and prices were reasonable, the culture, subway system is very good. Stayed and explored in and around Shinjuku, Shibuya, Harajuku, vintage shopping Shimokitazawa. Tons of shopping and eating areas. Was there for the World Championship that was an awesome event. We want to go back and see more of Japan such as Osaka and more.Show moreDGuest review byDebbieCanada10.0Tokyo is intense.Tokyo is intense. It was the 4th country on our world trip, and the ads everywhere felt like a full-on assault on the eyeballs. We took the metro for everything, which is great… if you enjoy being thoroughly confused and slightly panicked at all times. After a week in Shanghai, where commuting was a breeze, this felt like navigating a video game on expert mode, but we got used to always being lost and somehow ending up exactly where we weren’t supposed to be.
Shopping was best at Sunshine Mall...why waste time at stores I can visit at home? Food is amazing and cheap. The locals are incredibly nice… though English speakers are few, which kept things interesting. Overall, it’s chaotic, overwhelming, and kind of brilliant all at once.
You need a Suica Card on your phone traveling on the metro without it is a nightmare. Non-Japanese credit cards aren’t accepted, and the app is in Japanese, so good luck following any instructions. I used a Wise digital card on my phone, which works like a Visa and is accepted by Suica.
Here’s how we set it up: add the Wise card to your phone like any other visa, then add money to Suica after adding it under transit. Enable Express Mode on Suica so you can just tap your phone over the IC circle at the metro gate (on the back of the phone, not the front). A few stores in malls didn’t accept tap or our credit cards, but Suica worked perfectly.
You can transfer up to 20,000 yen at a time from Wise to Suica (the maximum balance on Suica is 20,000 yen, so if you already have 100, you can only add 19,900 more). For larger purchases, just keep transferring money in batches until you cover the total. This method saved us countless headaches and made paying for transit and shopping much easier.Show moreAGuest review byAnitaCanada10.0Japanese people are incredible nice...even neither language...Japanese people are incredible nice...even neither language is a barrier for them to make people happy and help.

I wasn’t particularly impressed by its traditional or local vibe, but it’s definitely great for shopping, tech, and food. The public transport is efficient, punctual, and offers a lot of options. However, you can still find nearby villages or towns, like Kamakura or Nikko, that offer a more traditional feel and a calmer atmosphere. Overall, it’s a great place to visit once in a lifetime to experience the hustle and bustle, but I don’t think you’d need to stay for too long.Show morePGuest review byPakapant RujichitUnited Kingdom6.0The people is the best of Tokyo. but it's very crowded.The people is the best of Tokyo. but it's very crowded.
