It’s so huge that you’ll have to come to grips with public transport and maybe even experience being pushed onto a train. Yes, it does actually happen!Get your bearings by ascending the Tokyo World Trade Centre near the waterfront, and savour the fantastic views taking in the red-and-white Tokyo Tower and Shinkuju’s skyscrapers. North is Ueno, home to the best museums (including the Tokyo National Museum) and a large park bursting with cherry blossom in spring.Equally tranquil are the Chiyoda Imperial Palace and Gardens, surrounded by water. Also in gardens is the Meiji Jingu Shinto shrine in Shibuya, a youthful district where neon abounds.For more traditional Japanese culture, head to Asakusa whose Sensō-ji Buddhist temple is Tokyo’s oldest temple. Markets in the grounds sell a variety of wares, though shopping in Tokyo is, of course, fantastic wherever you go.Whether you stay in a Japanese ryokan, luxury Tokyo hotel or a hostel, don’t fly out of Tokyo Narita Airport or Haneda Airport without having tried sushi. Another Japanese institution is the sento (public bath) and onsen (hot springs bath) – a must try. Also incredibly popular are Tokyo Disneyland and Tokyo DisneySea, Asia’s 2 most visited theme parks.Learn more about visiting Tokyo2079 attractions1747 points of interest61 neighbourhoodsFind out moreWhat guests said about Tokyo:10.0Tokyo is intense.Tokyo is intense. It was the 4th country on our world trip, and the ads everywhere felt like a full-on assault on the eyeballs. We took the metro for everything, which is great… if you enjoy being thoroughly confused and slightly panicked at all times. After a week in Shanghai, where commuting was a breeze, this felt like navigating a video game on expert mode, but we got used to always being lost and somehow ending up exactly where we weren’t supposed to be.
Shopping was best at Sunshine Mall...why waste time at stores I can visit at home? Food is amazing and cheap. The locals are incredibly nice… though English speakers are few, which kept things interesting. Overall, it’s chaotic, overwhelming, and kind of brilliant all at once.
You need a Suica Card on your phone traveling on the metro without it is a nightmare. Non-Japanese credit cards aren’t accepted, and the app is in Japanese, so good luck following any instructions. I used a Wise digital card on my phone, which works like a Visa and is accepted by Suica.
Here’s how we set it up: add the Wise card to your phone like any other visa, then add money to Suica after adding it under transit. Enable Express Mode on Suica so you can just tap your phone over the IC circle at the metro gate (on the back of the phone, not the front). A few stores in malls didn’t accept tap or our credit cards, but Suica worked perfectly.
You can transfer up to 20,000 yen at a time from Wise to Suica (the maximum balance on Suica is 20,000 yen, so if you already have 100, you can only add 19,900 more). For larger purchases, just keep transferring money in batches until you cover the total. This method saved us countless headaches and made paying for transit and shopping much easier.Show moreAGuest review byAnitaCanada10.0Japanese people are incredible nice...even neither language...Japanese people are incredible nice...even neither language is a barrier for them to make people happy and help.

I wasn’t particularly impressed by its traditional or local vibe, but it’s definitely great for shopping, tech, and food. The public transport is efficient, punctual, and offers a lot of options. However, you can still find nearby villages or towns, like Kamakura or Nikko, that offer a more traditional feel and a calmer atmosphere. Overall, it’s a great place to visit once in a lifetime to experience the hustle and bustle, but I don’t think you’d need to stay for too long.Show morePGuest review byPakapant RujichitUnited Kingdom6.0The people is the best of Tokyo. but it's very crowded.The people is the best of Tokyo. but it's very crowded. Tourists are crazy about famous places. But it's really worth visiting. I highlight the cleanliness, security, taxi and Uber services, customer service and bathrooms. The Japanese have achieved perfection.Show moreRGuest review byRegineBrazil10.0Tokyo was a whirlwind of neon lights, serene temples, and...Tokyo was a whirlwind of neon lights, serene temples, and impeccable hospitality. The city blends tradition and innovation so seamlessly—one moment you're sipping matcha in a centuries-old teahouse, the next you're navigating a robot-run café in Shibuya. Public transport was a dream: clean, punctual, and easy to navigate even for a first-timer. The locals were incredibly polite and helpful, and the food? A revelation. From sushi counters to steaming bowls of ramen tucked into alleyways, every meal was a highlight.
Whether you're chasing cherry blossoms or just craving a taste of hyper-modern city life, Tokyo delivers with style and grace.Show moreSGuest review bySamantha CarrollAustraliaSee reviews by guests who stayed at hotels in TokyoSee allLANDABOUT TOKYOFrom £142.93 per nightScored out of 10, guest rating 8.78.7Fabulous - What previous guests thought, 4,026 reviews Fabulous · 4,026 reviewsMy husband and I stayed there for 3 nights. The staff were well-spoken and attentive. They even helped us to order a taxi to the airport! The room was clean and comfortable, but a tad small since we had 3 luggages. However, we were able to make it work! They provide fresh towels every day, which is a plus. The hotel is located very close to Uguisudani JR station, and there is a lift to use once you cross the bridge towards the hotel. It is also within walking distance to Ueno Park!Show morewGuest review bywongAustraliaTHE KNOT TOKYO ShinjukuFrom £156.47 per nightScored out of 10, guest rating 8.48.4Very good - What previous guests thought, 12,382 reviews Very good · 12,382 reviewsBooked the 17m² Queen Park View room and it was great — spacious enough for two, with a very nice view. The room was comfortable, clean, and modern. The hotel is on the quieter side of Shinjuku, perfect if you want to be a little removed from the hustle and bustle, but still within easy reach of the action (a subway station is about 15 minute walk away.) The staff were super helpful and always eager to assist. Very nice hotel.Show moreCGuest review byCapucineUnited KingdomHotel Villa Fontaine Grand Tokyo-ShiodomeFrom £297.70 per nightScored out of 10, guest rating 8.48.4Very good - What previous guests thought, 3,636 reviews Very good · 3,636 reviewsA very convenient hotel.
