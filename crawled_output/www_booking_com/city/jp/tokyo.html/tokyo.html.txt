It’s so huge that you’ll have to come to grips with public transport and maybe even experience being pushed onto a train. Yes, it does actually happen!Get your bearings by ascending the Tokyo World Trade Center near the waterfront, and savor the fantastic views taking in the red-and-white Tokyo Tower and Shinkuju’s skyscrapers. North is Ueno, home to the best museums (including the Tokyo National Museum) and a large park bursting with cherry blossom in spring.Equally tranquil are the Chiyoda Imperial Palace and Gardens, surrounded by water. Also in gardens is the Meiji Jingu Shinto shrine in Shibuya, a youthful district where neon abounds.For more traditional Japanese culture, head to Asakusa whose Sensō-ji Buddhist temple is Tokyo’s oldest temple. Outdoor markets sell a variety of wares, though shopping in Tokyo is, of course, fantastic wherever you go.Whether you stay in a Japanese ryokan, luxury Tokyo hotel or a hostel, don’t fly out of Tokyo Narita Airport or Haneda Airport without having tried sushi. Another Japanese institution is the sento (public bath) and onsen (hot springs bath) – a must try. Also incredibly popular are Tokyo Disneyland and Tokyo DisneySea, Asia’s 2 most visited theme parks.Learn more about visiting Tokyo2086 attractions1747 points of interest61 neighborhoodsFind out moreWhat Guests Said About Tokyo:10.0Tokyo is intense.Tokyo is intense. It was the 4th country on our world trip, and the ads everywhere felt like a full-on assault on the eyeballs. We took the metro for everything, which is great… if you enjoy being thoroughly confused and slightly panicked at all times. After a week in Shanghai, where commuting was a breeze, this felt like navigating a video game on expert mode, but we got used to always being lost and somehow ending up exactly where we weren’t supposed to be.
Shopping was best at Sunshine Mall...why waste time at stores I can visit at home? Food is amazing and cheap. The locals are incredibly nice… though English speakers are few, which kept things interesting. Overall, it’s chaotic, overwhelming, and kind of brilliant all at once.
You need a Suica Card on your phone traveling on the metro without it is a nightmare. Non-Japanese credit cards aren’t accepted, and the app is in Japanese, so good luck following any instructions. I used a Wise digital card on my phone, which works like a Visa and is accepted by Suica.
Here’s how we set it up: add the Wise card to your phone like any other visa, then add money to Suica after adding it under transit. Enable Express Mode on Suica so you can just tap your phone over the IC circle at the metro gate (on the back of the phone, not the front). A few stores in malls didn’t accept tap or our credit cards, but Suica worked perfectly.
You can transfer up to 20,000 yen at a time from Wise to Suica (the maximum balance on Suica is 20,000 yen, so if you already have 100, you can only add 19,900 more). For larger purchases, just keep transferring money in batches until you cover the total. This method saved us countless headaches and made paying for transit and shopping much easier.Show moreAGuest review byAnitaCanada10.0Japanese people are incredible nice...even neither language...Japanese people are incredible nice...even neither language is a barrier for them to make people happy and help.

I wasn’t particularly impressed by its traditional or local vibe, but it’s definitely great for shopping, tech, and food. The public transport is efficient, punctual, and offers a lot of options. However, you can still find nearby villages or towns, like Kamakura or Nikko, that offer a more traditional feel and a calmer atmosphere. Overall, it’s a great place to visit once in a lifetime to experience the hustle and bustle, but I don’t think you’d need to stay for too long.Show morePGuest review byPakapant RujichitUnited Kingdom6.0The people is the best of Tokyo. but it's very crowded.The people is the best of Tokyo. but it's very crowded.

The city blends tradition and innovation so seamlessly—one moment you're sipping matcha in a centuries-old teahouse, the next you're navigating a robot-run café in Shibuya. Public transport was a dream: clean, punctual, and easy to navigate even for a first-timer. The locals were incredibly polite and helpful, and the food? A revelation. From sushi counters to steaming bowls of ramen tucked into alleyways, every meal was a highlight.
Whether you're chasing cherry blossoms or just craving a taste of hyper-modern city life, Tokyo delivers with style and grace.Show moreSGuest review bySamantha CarrollAustraliaSee reviews by guests who stayed at hotels in TokyoSee allall day place shibuyaFrom $446.29 per nightScored out of 10, guest rating 8.28.2Very Good - What previous guests thought, 4,674 reviews Very Good · 4,674 reviewsThis hotel is located in a central part of Shibuya and is easily walkable to Harajuku.
It has a "cool" vibe with an Italian restaurant on the main floor and a coffee shop/bar on the ground floor.
The staff were helpful when we needed them but generally hands-off as you check-in and check-out on computers in the lobby yourself.
