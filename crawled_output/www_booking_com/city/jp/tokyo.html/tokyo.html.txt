You could opt to stay here for the delicious breakfast buffet alone - featuring rotating Japanese foods as well as Western food, coffee, tea, and cute little pastries (milk buns are best!). However the staff and location set this spot apart in our opinion. Check in was simple, friendly, and the staff were fluent in english. However the staff at breakfast were extra kind. They explained everything to us from the process of timing, to some fun casual chats with them about our stay. It was so sweet. They asked if we had enough food, if we were cold (I had a short sleeved shirt on), and told us to take our time. We had a room on the third floor that overlooked the delightful little bamboo grove. Highly recommend relaxing in the chairs among those shoots if you have time. Everything was very clean. Location is truly 2 minutes from the nearest train station. The neighbourhood is safe and quiet. Excellent value for money in this classy spot.Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.19.1Wonderful - What previous guests thought, 1,139 reviewsWonderful 1,139 reviewsPrice from$123.631 night, 2 adultsCheck availabilityMIMARU Tokyo IkebukuroHotel in Toshima, TokyoIdeally set in the Toshima Ward district of Tokyo, MIMARU Tokyo Ikebukuro is located a 6-minute walk from Ikebukuro Nishi-guchi Park, 0.4 miles from Tobu Department Store Ikebukuro and a 9-minute walk...RRitenFromUnited Arab EmiratesBeautiful rooms, amazing facilities, great lounge area, fantastic staff.

It’s so huge that you’ll have to come to grips with public transport and maybe even experience being pushed onto a train. Yes, it does actually happen!Get your bearings by ascending the Tokyo World Trade Center near the waterfront, and savor the fantastic views taking in the red-and-white Tokyo Tower and Shinkuju’s skyscrapers. North is Ueno, home to the best museums (including the Tokyo National Museum) and a large park bursting with cherry blossom in spring.Equally tranquil are the Chiyoda Imperial Palace and Gardens, surrounded by water. Also in gardens is the Meiji Jingu Shinto shrine in Shibuya, a youthful district where neon abounds.For more traditional Japanese culture, head to Asakusa whose Sensō-ji Buddhist temple is Tokyo’s oldest temple. Outdoor markets sell a variety of wares, though shopping in Tokyo is, of course, fantastic wherever you go.Whether you stay in a Japanese ryokan, luxury Tokyo hotel or a hostel, don’t fly out of Tokyo Narita Airport or Haneda Airport without having tried sushi. Another Japanese institution is the sento (public bath) and onsen (hot springs bath) – a must try. Also incredibly popular are Tokyo Disneyland and Tokyo DisneySea, Asia’s 2 most visited theme parks.Learn more about visiting Tokyo2061 attractions1747 points of interest61 neighborhoodsFind out moreWhat Guests Said About Tokyo:10.0It was easy to get around - by foot, train, and ubers/taxis.It was easy to get around - by foot, train, and ubers/taxis.

I would come in a cooler month due the amount of walking you do coupled with the amount of people. Access to anything is so easy - airports, trains, other transport but we did struggle a few times to get a cab/grab so we just ended up finding an alternative option.

We want to go back and see more of Japan such as Osaka and more.Show moreDGuest review byDebbieCanada10.0Tokyo is intense.Tokyo is intense. It was the 4th country on our world trip, and the ads everywhere felt like a full-on assault on the eyeballs. We took the metro for everything, which is great… if you enjoy being thoroughly confused and slightly panicked at all times. After a week in Shanghai, where commuting was a breeze, this felt like navigating a video game on expert mode, but we got used to always being lost and somehow ending up exactly where we weren’t supposed to be.
Shopping was best at Sunshine Mall...why waste time at stores I can visit at home? Food is amazing and cheap. The locals are incredibly nice… though English speakers are few, which kept things interesting. Overall, it’s chaotic, overwhelming, and kind of brilliant all at once.
You need a Suica Card on your phone traveling on the metro without it is a nightmare. Non-Japanese credit cards aren’t accepted, and the app is in Japanese, so good luck following any instructions. I used a Wise digital card on my phone, which works like a Visa and is accepted by Suica.
Here’s how we set it up: add the Wise card to your phone like any other visa, then add money to Suica after adding it under transit. Enable Express Mode on Suica so you can just tap your phone over the IC circle at the metro gate (on the back of the phone, not the front). A few stores in malls didn’t accept tap or our credit cards, but Suica worked perfectly.
You can transfer up to 20,000 yen at a time from Wise to Suica (the maximum balance on Suica is 20,000 yen, so if you already have 100, you can only add 19,900 more). For larger purchases, just keep transferring money in batches until you cover the total. This method saved us countless headaches and made paying for transit and shopping much easier.Show moreAGuest review byAnitaCanadaSee reviews by guests who stayed at hotels in TokyoSee allThe Edo SakuraScored out of 10, guest rating 9.19.1Wonderful - What previous guests thought, 1,833 reviews Wonderful · 1,833 reviewsThis hotel is a perfect mix of modern comfort, excellent location, friendly and skilled staff with the charm of a "ryokan" decoration and atmosphere. Breakfasts were fresh, varied and good value for money and the staff could help us with all of our requests (taxi, dietary requirement, extra matress etc.).
One subway station is 5 min away, 1 really useful train station 15 min away and Yanesen and Ueno Park at walkable distance.
If we had to plan our trip again we would definitely stay at the Edo Sakura!Show moreAGuest review byArthurSwedenall day place shibuyaFrom $434.53 per nightScored out of 10, guest rating 8.28.2Very Good - What previous guests thought, 4,657 reviews Very Good · 4,657 reviewsThis hotel is located in a central part of Shibuya and is easily walkable to Harajuku.
It has a "cool" vibe with an Italian restaurant on the main floor and a coffee shop/bar on the ground floor.
The staff were helpful when we needed them but generally hands-off as you check-in and check-out on computers in the lobby yourself.
Our room was on the 13th floor so we didn't hear any street noise, which was nice. My husband and I enjoyed our stay overall.Show moreAGuest review byAmandaUnited StatesKOKO HOTEL Residence Asakusa KappabashiFrom $357.04 per nightScored out of 10, guest rating 9.09.0Wonderful - What previous guests thought, 1,661 reviews Wonderful · 1,661 reviewsThere's plenty to do in Asakusa - heaps of food/nightlife and shopping options without being quite as hectic as Shinjuku and Shibuya. Koko hotel is in a nice quiet street away from the hustle and bustle but only a short walk (10 mins?) from the main shopping and eating areas and the Sensoji shrine and Nakamise street. Staff were helpful and friendly. Nice lobby. Clean, tidy, comfortable and modern room. Slept 5 of us (Japanese style in the one room).Show moreJGuest review byJustinNew ZealandPetit Bali IkebukuroFrom $133.13 per nightScored out of 10, guest rating 8.78.7Excellent - What previous guests thought, 226 reviews Excellent · 226 reviewsStaff were very friendly and willing to help with anything.
