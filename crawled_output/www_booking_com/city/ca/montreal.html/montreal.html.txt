Montreal truly has it all. Divided into East and West by Boulevard Saint-Laurent, there are several districts to the city, each offering a distinct atmosphere. Downtown is best explored on foot, as you weave your way through skyscrapers and visit museums such as the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts. In the winter you can steer clear of icy paths by heading underground to the passages of the Underground City, full of shops, movie theaters and food courts. From there, the metro will conveniently take you outwards in any direction you might want to go, from the historic Old Montreal to the hip café and restaurant culture of the Quartier Latin-Le Village. In summer, stay closer to the historic quarter and head outdoors in Parc Jean-Drapeau on the St. Lawrence River islands of Île Sainte-Helen and Île Notre-Dame. If the weather isn’t good enough for rowing, water-skiing and beaches then head to Montreal Casino. Whether you’re visiting for festivals or fashion, gastronomy or culture, with over 190 hotels and B&Bs with Booking.com you’ll find your perfect home away from home.Learn more about visiting Montreal192 attractions106 points of interest20 neighborhoodsFind out moreWhat Guests Said About Montreal:10.0Montreal is an amazing city that's safe, extremely clean and...Montreal is an amazing city that's safe, extremely clean and filled with tons of great restaurants and things to do.
I recommend bringing, or renting bikes because the city is loaded with bike paths and that's definitely the best way to get around. Traveling by car takes forever and is definitely not the best way to get around. The Lachine Bike Path takes you to some beautiful locations around the city. Turn on your Googlemaps bike maps and you'll see the city is just loaded with bike paths. The public transit is also a great way to get around.
I suggest walking around Old Montreal, ride the Ferris wheel for great views, walk the boardwalk and enjoy an authentic French meal. The wine and microbrew scenes are spectacular. Hike around Mount Royal, and then check out the St. Joseph's oratory of mount royal - walk the steps, check out the sculpture garden and take in a beautiful sunset view.
I also suggest buying a museum pass and checking out some of the amazing museums the city has to offer. The Planetarium, Botanical Gardens, Biodome and Insectarium are all on the same campus and are a must see when visiting.
We were only in the city for 5 days, but we could have easily stayed 7 - 10 days and found plenty to do everyday.Show moreAGuest review byAnonymous8.0We took a cab to make our lives easier.We took a cab to make our lives easier. We loved the old city and port.
Auberge du Vieux Port was our favorite restaurant.
It was easy to get a cab from our hotel but sometimes difficult to return to the hotel depending where we were and the Metro was quite challenging when we could not find the elevator.
I was a little surprised that the streets and many houses needed an upgrade.
But overall what we love the most about Montreal is a peaceful atmosphere, a diverse population and extreme friendliness.Show moreWGuest review byWillemsen6.0CONSTRUCTION IS A NIGHTMARE....CONSTRUCTION IS A NIGHTMARE....WE WILL NOT GO BACK UNTIL THIS IS FIXED.

For outsiders trying to figure out where to shop and where to enter underground is a real challenge. I think there would be many lost sales just through tourists not being able to work it out. It’s not well signposted. The metro system is fantastic although I’d love to see much more art on all those big grey walls. The flower buckets around town make the city come alive. They are magnificent. I’d like to know how to get up to the hills behind Montreal but did not see any directions on streets or materials referring to them. The footpaths are a bit hazardous to elderly tourists as they have many cracks. It would be nice to know why so much of Montreal is still being dug up 4 years after my last visit. Public information on sites seems to be an opportunity to inform tourists, as happens in Sydney Australia. One of the nicest features of the city are the street armchairs in the old town which are so good for tired tourists. Put them in everywhere! Thank you for a lovely experience.Show moreMGuest review byMurrayAustralia10.0Montreal was great.Montreal was great.
