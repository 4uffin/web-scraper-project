Montreal truly has it all. Divided into East and West by Boulevard Saint-Laurent, there are several districts to the city, each offering a distinct atmosphere. Downtown is best explored on foot, as you weave your way through skyscrapers and visit museums such as the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts. In the winter you can steer clear of icy paths by heading underground to the passages of the Underground City, full of shops, movie theaters and food courts. From there, the metro will conveniently take you outwards in any direction you might want to go, from the historic Old Montreal to the hip café and restaurant culture of the Quartier Latin-Le Village. In summer, stay closer to the historic quarter and head outdoors in Parc Jean-Drapeau on the St. Lawrence River islands of Île Sainte-Helen and Île Notre-Dame. If the weather isn’t good enough for rowing, water-skiing and beaches then head to Montreal Casino. Whether you’re visiting for festivals or fashion, gastronomy or culture, with over 190 hotels and B&Bs with Booking.com you’ll find your perfect home away from home.Learn more about visiting Montreal192 attractions106 points of interest20 neighborhoodsFind out moreWhat Guests Said About Montreal:10.0Montreal was great.Montreal was great.
