Montreal truly has it all. Divided into East and West by Boulevard Saint-Laurent, there are several districts to the city, each offering a distinct atmosphere.Downtown is best explored on foot, as you weave your way through skyscrapers and visit museums such as the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts. In the winter time you can steer clear of icy paths by heading underground through the passages of the Underground City, full of shops, cinemas and food courts.From here metros will conveniently take you outwards in any direction you might want to go, from the historic Old Montreal to the hip café and restaurant culture of the Quartier Latin-Le Village.
In summer, stay closer to the old town and head outdoors in Parc Jean-Drapeau on the St Lawrence River islands of Île Sainte-Helen and Île Notre-Dame. If the weather isn’t fine enough for rowing, water-skiing and beaches then head to the Montreal Casino.Whether you’re visiting for festivals or fashion, gastronomy or culture, with over 190 hotels and B&Bs with Booking.com you’ll find your perfect home away from home.Learn more about visiting Montréal194 attractions106 points of interest20 neighbourhoodsFind out moreWhat guests said about Montréal:10.0There was so much to see and do, we didn’t scratch the...There was so much to see and do, we didn’t scratch the surface.
