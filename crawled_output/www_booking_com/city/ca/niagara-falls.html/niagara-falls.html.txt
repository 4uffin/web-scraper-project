Rain ponchos are provided. Alternatively, there’s the Journey Behind the Falls – a walk through the rock behind Niagara. Handy portholes help you experience the thundering water. Slightly downstream are the American Falls, less well-known and less impressive, but worth a look. At night, both falls get illuminated by colored lights – an incredible sight. Further downstream is the Rainbow Bridge which you can walk across to get an American stamp in your passport. Just check your visa requirements first. The city itself has 7 golf courses, with one right by the river – be careful with your swing! Other Niagara Falls attractions include casinos, movie theaters and Marineland Canada, featuring the world's largest whale habitat for viewing orcas both above and below ground.Unless you fly into Niagara Falls Airport on the US side, you’ll probably arrive by car. So check out the hotels, apartments, motels and more on Booking.com with easy parking options.Learn more about visiting Niagara Falls148 attractions18 points of interest4 neighborhoodsFind out moreWhat Guests Said About Niagara Falls:10.0All was amazing.All was amazing.
