Taipei 101, once the world’s tallest building, dominates its skyline from Xinyi, an area known for the most active nightlife.At Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall the national flag is raised every morning and the guard changed every hour. Less known for tourists is National Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall, containing a tall bronze statue of the country’s founding father.Of the wealth of Taipei museums, the best are Shung Ye Museum of Formosan Aborigines and the National Palace Museum – one of world’s largest collections of Chinese artifacts. Even more numerous are the temples dedicated to Buddhist, Taoist and Chinese folk religions. Xinsheng South Road is nicknamed ‘Road to Heaven’ for its sheer number, but most famous is Longshan Temple in Wanhua, the oldest district.Taipei shopping is fantastic and includes Core Pacific Living Mall, supposedly Asia’s largest. The Ximending area has lots of shops (and karaoke), while the Shilin Night Market should not be missed. For a break from the bustle head to central Daan Forest Park, the botanical gardens with its lotus ponds,or Yangmingshan National Park, known for hot spring baths and spring cherry blossom.Whether you fly into Songshan or Taiwan Taoyuan Airport, efficient public transport takes you to the Taipei hotels on Booking.com.Learn more about visiting Taipei152 points of interest19 neighbourhoodsFind out moreWhat guests said about Taipei:10.0Taipei offers something for every traveler, making it...Taipei offers something for every traveler, making it perfect for both short breaks and longer adventures.
