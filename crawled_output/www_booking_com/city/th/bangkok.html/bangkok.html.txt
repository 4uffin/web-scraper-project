Remember none of the staff experienced this situation before. The alarm was raised in a very timely manner following the first tremor.

Recommended sights are MOCA (Museum of Contemporary Art) (probably Bangkok‚Äôs best gallery) Wat Pho, Wat Arun at sunset and the Khon theatre.

It is, in all ways, one of the most exciting and vibrant of places where pretty much most things are value for money and almost everything is a photograph.
Food is wonderful and varied and can be extremely cheap. Chaos and contrast are pretty much the norm but it needs to be experienced before a trip to the wondrous southern islands to make a holiday almost complete.
I can't recommend the city highly enough on a bucket list of 'must to dos'Show moreDGuest review byDavidUnited KingdomSee reviews by guests who stayed at hotels in BangkokSee allSindhorn Midtown Hotel Bangkok, Vignette Collection by IHGPathumwan, BangkokFrom $167.70 per nightScored out of 10, guest rating 9.19.1Wonderful - What previous guests thought, 3,700 reviews Wonderful¬†¬∑¬†3,700 reviewsLocated a 40 min. - 70 min (early morning vs day time) drive by cab from the BKK Airport in the center (if you can say so looking at the size of Bangkok).

This is the part of Bangkok that you want to stay in general. Close to all major sights. The food was great, cappucino the best we had in Thailand. The room is very comfortable and the rooftop infinitypool with bar is a great way to calm and cool down after a day of sightseeing in hot weather. It was everything we wanted and needed for a good priceShow moreRGuest review byRolandNetherlandsHansar Bangkok HotelPathumwan, BangkokFrom $420.28 per nightScored out of 10, guest rating 8.78.7Excellent - What previous guests thought, 685 reviews Excellent¬†¬∑¬†685 reviewsA Fantastic find in the middle of Bangkok, surrounded by well know international 5* brand hotels, within easy walking distance to local sights and shopping precincts. Great value for money to be able to have a one bedroom suite for the same price a king room in a neighbouring international brand hotel. Decor and size of the room was great and representative of the local culture. Good breakfast on the 12th floor terrace with good views.Show moreFGuest review byFergoSaudi ArabiaEastin Grand Hotel PhayathaiRatchathewi, BangkokFrom $373.05 per nightScored out of 10, guest rating 9.59.5Exceptional - What previous guests thought, 6,425 reviews Exceptional¬†¬∑¬†6,425 reviewsNicely finished, great pool with views, restaurant on site was very nice Mediterranean food albeit a little more pricey than you would typically pay in Bangkok. Easy to get a cab to the airport from here. Staff were very eager to help.
There is a canteen type food court in the retail area with well priced food beneath the hotel - worth popping to.Show moreSGuest review bySarahUnited KingdomTastoria Collection SukhumvitKhlong Toei, BangkokFrom $302.86 per nightScored out of 10, guest rating 8.78.7Excellent - What previous guests thought, 1,397 reviews Excellent¬†¬∑¬†1,397 reviewsExcellent pre-arrival communication and front office staff.
