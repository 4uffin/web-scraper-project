Catch a boat up river on the Chao Phraya Express or discover different neighborhoods on the blissfully air-conditioned BTS Skytrain. A taxi or exhilarating tuk-tuk ride is never far away from the big attractions, which include Chinatown, Jim Thompson House and the floating markets at Damnoen Saduak. To step out of the frenetic energy of street food stalls, amulet markets and the sizzling temperatures, discover an oasis of calm in one of the many Buddhist temples. Be awed by the majesty of the Grand Palace and marvel at the world’s longest reclining Buddha at Wat Pho. While you’re there why not relax even more with a traditional Thai massage?

The mix of golden temples and modern buildings makes every corner interesting. I loved visiting the Grand Palace and Wat Arun, and the floating markets were a totally new experience. Street food here is amazing—pad thai, mango sticky rice, and so many flavors you can’t miss. Shopping is fun too, from huge malls to little street stalls where you can bargain. Getting around is easy with the BTS Skytrain and boats, though the traffic can get crazy sometimes. The nightlife is also super lively with night markets and rooftop bars.

It’s not for people who don’t like crowds and traffic though and there isn’t much greenery. Getting around isn’t easy and takes time as traffic jams are common.
Recommended sights are MOCA (Museum of Contemporary Art) (probably Bangkok’s best gallery) Wat Pho, Wat Arun at sunset and the Khon theatre. Recommended restaurant is Ama DimSum opposite Samyan Mitrtown, delicious Chinese Thai. Don’t be frightened to try cheaper food and street food as it’s often very good.Show morePGuest review byPanayiotisAustralia10.0We feel that the pollution and cleanliness
