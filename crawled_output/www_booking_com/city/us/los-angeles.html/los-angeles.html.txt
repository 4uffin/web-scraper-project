Santa Monica Pier is the end point of the fabled Route 66, while just south is bohemian Venice Beach, lined by tall, swaying palms. Go slightly inland from the boardwalk to catch a
glimpse of the canals that earned the area its name.Head north to the golden beach and stunning scenery of Malibu and see why movie stars over the decades have settled here. Also popular with the rich and famous are Bel Air and Beverly Hills, home to exclusive Rodeo Drive.And the reason for all this glitz and glamour? Hollywood, of course! Sitting high on a hill, the iconic sign is visible for miles around, while below the gold stars on Hollywood Boulevard immortalize celebrities of past and present.  Be there on premiere night to see them grace the red carpet of Grauman’s Chinese Theater.Over the hill is Universal Studios, with behind-the-scenes tours as well as rides. Next door are the Warner Brothers Studios, and Paramount Studios are closer to Downtown LA.Whether you decide to live like a star in a luxury LA hotel or choose a cheap motel through Booking.com, it’s worth renting a car to get around this sprawling city and out to Los Angeles Airport (LAX).Learn more about visiting Los Angeles1406 attractions107 points of interest27 neighborhoodsFind out moreWhat Guests Said About Los Angeles:10.0I've been to LA several times -- it is a city with many,...I've been to LA several times -- it is a city with many, many neighborhoods and experiences -- the beach at Santa Monica, Pasadena, driving down palm tree-lined streets, great and unusual museums, Hollywood, unique and fun architecture,

L.A., in particular, has its contrasting images. The filth, graffiti, and rundown properties are not so well hidden from sight.
Los Angeles does a better job than most cities at showcasing its glitz and glamour, so be prepared to see less of one and more of the other. It's in those spaces between where much of L.A.'s magic can be discovered with its people, places, and things to do.Show moreDGuest review byDennisUnited States4.0Thus far, getting in/out of LAX has been worse than any...Thus far, getting in/out of LAX has been worse than any airport.

The culture is a window to the world. You can see, have anything from the globe in L.A.!
Since I take public transport I am glad to see more security presence. Metro has definitely upped their game.

Central Los Angeles is full of homeless people and dirty streets, which made me sad. Other than that it's a multicultural city with a fascinating history. I wouldn't recommend visiting in the summer, though: heat and humidity are unbearable; there are repairs and diversions on the bus routes and public services seem to work slower. All in all, I enjoyed my stay, I would definitely come back.
