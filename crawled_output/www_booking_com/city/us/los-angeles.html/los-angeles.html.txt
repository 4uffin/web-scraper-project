The staff were incredibly kind, professional, and always willing to help. The hotel is modern, spotless, simple, and very functional—perfect for a comfortable stay in Los Angeles.
What impressed me the most was their attention to detail: I had a package delivered before my arrival, and the team made sure it was waiting for me in my room when I checked in. That level of service really made the difference.

Santa Monica Pier is the ending point of fabled Route 66, while just south is bohemian Venice Beach, lined by tall, swaying palms. Go slightly inland from the boardwalk to glimpse the canals that earned the area its name.Head north to the golden beach and stunning scenery of Malibu and see why movie stars over the decades have settled here. Also popular with the rich and famous are Bel Air and Beverly Hills, home to exclusive Rodeo Drive.And the reason for all this glitz and glamour? Hollywood, of course! Sitting high on a hill, the iconic sign is visible for miles around, while below the gold stars on Hollywood Boulevard immortalise celebrities of past and present.  Be there on premiere night to see them grace the red carpet of Grauman’s Chinese Theatre.Over the hill is Universal Studios, offering behind-the-scenes tours as well as rides. Next door are the Warner Brothers Studios, and Paramount Studios are closer to Downtown LA.Whether you decide to live like a star in a luxury LA hotel or choose a cheap motel through Booking.com, it’s worth renting a car to get around this sprawling city and out to Los Angeles Airport (LAX).Learn more about visiting Los Angeles1406 attractions107 points of interest27 neighbourhoodsFind out moreWhat guests said about Los Angeles:8.0California is amazing!California is amazing!

L.A., in particular, has its contrasting images. The filth, graffiti, and rundown properties are not so well hidden from sight.
Los Angeles does a better job than most cities at showcasing its glitz and glamour, so be prepared to see less of one and more of the other. It's in those spaces between where much of L.A.'s magic can be discovered with its people, places, and things to do.Show moreDGuest review byDennisUnited States4.0Thus far, getting in/out of LAX has been worse than any...Thus far, getting in/out of LAX has been worse than any airport. Waiting for car rental shuttle, waiting for car rental, getting out of LAX. Hit-n-Miss hotel accommodations. Public transportation seems to be adequate, perhaps this is the way to get around.

But I do not travel as much there as I used to. Some parts of Hollywood are pleasant,
relatively safe.
The culture is a window to the world. You can see, have anything from the globe in L.A.!
Since I take public transport I am glad to see more security presence. Metro has definitely upped their game.

Central Los Angeles is full of homeless people and dirty streets, which made me sad. Other than that it's a multicultural city with a fascinating history. I wouldn't recommend visiting in the summer, though: heat and humidity are unbearable; there are repairs and diversions on the bus routes and public services seem to work slower. All in all, I enjoyed my stay, I would definitely come back.
