Santa Monica Pier is the end point of the fabled Route 66, while just south is bohemian Venice Beach, lined by tall, swaying palms. Go slightly inland from the boardwalk to catch a
glimpse of the canals that earned the area its name.Head north to the golden beach and stunning scenery of Malibu and see why movie stars over the decades have settled here. Also popular with the rich and famous are Bel Air and Beverly Hills, home to exclusive Rodeo Drive.And the reason for all this glitz and glamour? Hollywood, of course! Sitting high on a hill, the iconic sign is visible for miles around, while below the gold stars on Hollywood Boulevard immortalize celebrities of past and present.  Be there on premiere night to see them grace the red carpet of Grauman’s Chinese Theater.Over the hill is Universal Studios, with behind-the-scenes tours as well as rides. Next door are the Warner Brothers Studios, and Paramount Studios are closer to Downtown LA.Whether you decide to live like a star in a luxury LA hotel or choose a cheap motel through Booking.com, it’s worth renting a car to get around this sprawling city and out to Los Angeles Airport (LAX).Learn more about visiting Los Angeles1404 attractions107 points of interest27 neighborhoodsFind out moreWhat Guests Said About Los Angeles:8.0California is amazing!California is amazing!

L.A., in particular, has its contrasting images. The filth, graffiti, and rundown properties are not so well hidden from sight.
Los Angeles does a better job than most cities at showcasing its glitz and glamour, so be prepared to see less of one and more of the other. It's in those spaces between where much of L.A.'s magic can be discovered with its people, places, and things to do.Show moreDGuest review byDennisUnited States4.0Thus far, getting in/out of LAX has been worse than any...Thus far, getting in/out of LAX has been worse than any airport.

relatively safe.
The culture is a window to the world. You can see, have anything from the globe in L.A.!
Since I take public transport I am glad to see more security presence. Metro has definitely upped their game.

Central Los Angeles is full of homeless people and dirty streets, which made me sad. Other than that it's a multicultural city with a fascinating history. I wouldn't recommend visiting in the summer, though: heat and humidity are unbearable; there are repairs and diversions on the bus routes and public services seem to work slower. All in all, I enjoyed my stay, I would definitely come back.

The house was pretty nice at one point in the past, and this is probably the cheapest chance you'll get to stay in the hills.(around 200USD per night)Show moreMGuest review byMatthewSouth KoreaBLVD Hotel and Studios Universal-Hollywood, an Ascend Collection HotelUniversal City, Los AngelesFrom $310.34 per nightScored out of 10, guest rating 7.37.3Good - What previous guests thought, 2,001 reviews Good · 2,001 reviewsYou would only stay here for universal and it’s a short walk away, so that’s good. I think the extra charges for parking are too much considering the hotel is not cheap. It was clean, that’s all we needed. The area around the hotel is not nice and I wouldn’t walk around there if I had kids with me.Show moreCGuest review byCharlotteUnited KingdomResearch, refine, and make plans for your whole tripHotels in New YorkTake a look at hotels in New York and explore more of the United States.Hotels in Las VegasDiscover another destination in the United States.Hotels in the United StatesPack a bigger bag and see more of the country.Cheap vacations in Los AngelesBook the best flights, stays, and more – all in one placeHotels in San FranciscoTry another destination popular with our guests.Hotels in San ClementeTry another destination popular with our guests.Hotels in CaliforniaLook beyond Los Angeles and discover more of California.Hotels in Los Angeles Metropolitan AreaExtend your search and explore the surrounding area.Things to do in Los AngelesHow will you spend your time in the city?Show more
