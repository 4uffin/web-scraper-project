Aside from skyscrapers housing industrial banks, the skyline is dominated by monuments of the Church of the Latter-Day Saints which is headquartered here.A church member, Brigham Young, founded the city in what is now This Is The Place Heritage Park. A tower sculpture commemorates the settlers’ trek across America by handcart, an example of which is in the Pioneer Memorial Museum. Walled Temple Square has the main Mormon sights: the Temple is only visitable by members, but anyone can listen to the famous Tabernacle choir.The State Capitol sits majestically on top of a hill with views of peaks offering winter skiing and summer hiking. The city hosted the 2002 Winter Olympics and one venue was the Olympic Cauldron Park within the University of Utah, also home of the Fine Art Museum and Natural History Museum.The Gilgal Sculpture Garden is a more unusual Salt Lake City attraction and down the road is the Trolley Square Mall. More branded stores are in the Gateway District, while Sugar House is more trendy and eclectic.Booking.com’s accommodation options include hotels with hot tubs, motels allowing pets and cheap apartments near Salt Lake City Airport.Learn more about visiting Salt Lake City120 attractions14 points of interest2 neighbourhoodsFind out moreWhat guests said about Salt Lake City:10.0I feel good about this place, feel safe walking around and...I feel good about this place, feel safe walking around and overall view of the city was very good.

Even under construction, Temple Square was amazing.
The pioneer spirit that is so evident there is remarkable.
All the museums and interactive activities were crazy good.
The Family Search Center should you your own family lineage and who your ancestors are.
Center City mall was pricy but very nice.
Outside SLC, just little south was Thanksgiving Pointe.
So incredible for children, but there is fine dining too as well as a day spa and Tom Holman (May be off on his name a bit) his stain glass gallery is beautiful. And the shops are great too.
I especially liked the shop converted from the old mill.
It has all the gears & mechanisms of the mill still emplace.
That kept my husband busy while I shopped.Show moreAGuest review byAnonymousUnited States10.0Lots of history here.
