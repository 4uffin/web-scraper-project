CConnollyFromUnited StatesReally great proximity to the D train (Bay 50 St), which takes you directly to the “touristy” spots of Manhattan. As a group of three young females traveling, we chose to take an Uber from the train station late at night as an extra caution, though we felt quite safe walking to and from the train during the day. The staff were exceptionally friendly and accommodating, no matter the time of day — I cannot say enough nice things about them! The building is well maintained, and the room was clean and comfortable. Great value, especially around the holidays. The free parking was also a huge plus! I would definitely stay here again, and would recommend it to anyone looking for an excellent, reasonably priced, hotel.Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 8.18.1Very Good - What previous guests thought, 1,278 reviewsVery Good 1,278 reviewsPrice from$158.391 night, 2 adultsCheck availabilityPod BrooklynHotel in Williamsburg, BrooklynThe Pod Hotel Brooklyn is located 2113 feet from the Music Hall of Williamsburg and 3169 feet from State of New York – East River State Park. jjeremyFromAbkhaziaGreat staff great hotel in a great areaShow moreScored out of 10, guest rating 8.48.4Very Good - What previous guests thought, 4,893 reviewsVery Good 4,893 reviewsPrice from$149.401 night, 2 adultsCheck availabilityEVEN Hotel Brooklyn by IHGHotel in Downtown Brooklyn, BrooklynSet in Brooklyn, 2641 feet from Barclays Center, EVEN Hotel Brooklyn features a terrace and views of the city.

It's also connected to Staten Island by the lengthy Verrazano Narrows Bridge. Ocean-going liners pass under here before docking at the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal in Red Hook. To the northeast, Brooklyn Bridge Park has some of the best views of the Manhattan skyline, while southeast is the huge Prospect Park.On one edge is Brooklyn Museum, the country’s 2nd largest art gallery, and just behind is the Brooklyn Botanic Gardens whose cherry trees bloom a vibrant pink. To the east are some hotels near JFK Airport, and there are more in neighboring Queens.At Brooklyn’s southernmost tip, Coney Island’s historic boardwalk has appeared in several films. Renovations are underway to bring it back to its former glory, and the revamped Luna features a historic wooden roller coaster. Also historic is the northern Greenpoint district with its elegant 19th-century houses.Cheap Brooklyn hotels are great alternatives to accommodations in Manhattan, so check Booking.com for the best deals.Learn more about visiting Brooklyn2008 attractions25 points of interest11 neighborhoodsFind out moreWhat Guests Said About Brooklyn:10.0Wonderful place to walk around.
