On the western end of Long Island, across the East River from Manhattan, this huge NYC borough is so densely populated that if it were its own city, it would rank as the 4th largest in the US!The borough is connected to Manhattan by 3 bridges: Williamsburg, Manhattan and the iconic Brooklyn Bridge. It's also connected to Staten Island by the lengthy Verrazano Narrows Bridge. Ocean-going liners pass under here before docking at the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal in Red Hook. To the northeast, Brooklyn Bridge Park has some of the best views of the Manhattan skyline, while southeast is the huge Prospect Park.On one edge is Brooklyn Museum, the country’s 2nd largest art gallery, and just behind is the Brooklyn Botanic Gardens whose cherry trees bloom a vibrant pink. To the east are some hotels near JFK Airport, and there are more in neighboring Queens.At Brooklyn’s southernmost tip, Coney Island’s historic boardwalk has appeared in several films. Renovations are underway to bring it back to its former glory, and the revamped Luna features a historic wooden roller coaster. Also historic is the northern Greenpoint district with its elegant 19th-century houses.Cheap Brooklyn hotels are great alternatives to accommodations in Manhattan, so check Booking.com for the best deals.Learn more about visiting Brooklyn2010 attractions25 points of interest11 neighborhoodsFind out moreWhat Guests Said About Brooklyn:10.0We were in Brooklyn for my daughter's wedding.We were in Brooklyn for my daughter's wedding.
