On the western end of Long Island, across the East River from Manhattan, this huge NYC borough is so densely populated that if it were a city, it would rank as the 4th largest in the US!The borough is joined to Manhattan by 3 bridges: Williamsburg, Manhattan and the iconic Brooklyn Bridge. It is also linked to Staten Island by the lengthy Verrazano Narrows Bridge. Ocean-going liners pass under here before docking at the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal in Red Hook. To the north-east, Brooklyn Bridge Park offers some of the best views of the Manhattan skyline, while south-east is the huge Prospect Park.On one edge is Brooklyn Museum, the country’s 2nd largest art gallery, and just behind is the Brooklyn Botanic Gardens whose cherry trees bloom a vibrant pink. To the east are some hotels near JFK Airport, and there are more in neighbouring Queens.At Brooklyn’s southernmost tip, Coney Island’s historic boardwalk has appeared in several films. Regeneration is underway to bring it back to its former glory, and the revamped Luna features a historic wooden rollercoaster. Also historic is the northern Greenpoint district with its elegant 19th-century houses.Cheap Brooklyn hotels offer a good alternative to accommodation in Manhattan, so check Booking.com for the best deals.Learn more about visiting Brooklyn2002 attractions25 points of interest11 neighbourhoodsFind out moreWhat guests said about Brooklyn:10.0We were in Brooklyn for my daughter's wedding.We were in Brooklyn for my daughter's wedding.
