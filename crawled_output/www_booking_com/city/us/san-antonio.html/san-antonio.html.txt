One of the city’s former Spanish missions, the Alamo was the site of a deadly battle that cost folk hero Davy Crockett his life. The other remaining missions - Concepcion, San Jose, San Juan, and Espada with its aqueduct - are dotted around the city. The attractive Spanish Governor’s Palace also remains.The San Antonio River runs right through the city, below street level. Known as the Riverwalk, its banks have been cleverly developed to house riverfront restaurants, bars and shops, and are spectacularly lit for Christmas. There are several San Antonio hotels by the Riverwalk which are also close to the Rivercenter Mall, the city’s biggest shopping center, while La Villita artisan village has more traditional crafts.Across the road in Hemisfair is the Tower of the Americas, a tall observation tower with a revolving restaurant overlooking the Alamodome, a huge sports and convention venue, home to the annual Alamo Bowl collegiate football game. Booking.com has several San Antonio hotels near the Alamodome, and more accommodations near San Antonio Airport.On the outskirts of the city are Sea World and Six Flags Fiesta Texas. The city also hosts the San Antonio Stock Show & Rodeo, one of the country’s biggest Western events.Learn more about visiting San Antonio135 attractions61 points of interest13 neighborhoodsFind out moreWhat Guests Said About San Antonio:10.0The Hop On Hop Off was the most helpful.The Hop On Hop Off was the most helpful.
