We visited a total of 12 different parks (all the Disney parks, Universal, SeaWorld, ICON Park, and Aquatica).
This really is the world capital of theme parks!
Orlando also has great food, shopping, and of course, amazing theme parks.
You’ll need a vehicle to get around—everything is just a few minutes’ drive, but not really walkableShow moreTGuest review byTomerIsrael8.0The Disney parks were great, but some of the rides are a bit...The Disney parks were great, but some of the rides are a bit old as we have been coming to Orlando for some years now and have seen them all.The new park at Universal was a bit of a let down ,we had to be in line for over 2 hours for a basic 2 minutes ride which was a copy of the one in Universal LA.some of the rides were broken down, for people in their 70's the stairs were abit of a trial.The food restaurants in Universal Epic were very good, Disney should improve theirs to the Epic standard.Show moreFGuest review byFrankIreland8.0We had a hire car as we always do as public transport is not...We had a hire car as we always do as public transport is not as widely available in Orlando as in other cities. Uber and Lift are easily available but we prefer to have our own car for ease of use. The cost of car hire has
fallen so it is not as expensive as it was just after covid.
We did find that the cost of food in the supermarkets and restaurants has risen since our last visit, quite substantially in some places.
There do not seem to be the buffet style eateries which were always such good value for a quick stop meal, I’m guessing most have now closed down which is sad.
Anyone planning a theme park trip will already know the tickets aren’t cheap! However there are good combinations to be had and strangely it seems the longer you buy tickets for the better value they are, even if it means you don’t use every day up. Food and drink in the parks is expensive but water stations are freely available to refill bottles.Show moreTGuest review byTraceyUnited Kingdom10.0My daughter and I love Orlando.My daughter and I love Orlando.
