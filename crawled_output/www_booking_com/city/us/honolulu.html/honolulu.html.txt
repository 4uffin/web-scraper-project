Reminded me of Shibuya or Osaka (also in part due to affluence of Japanese tourists). We didn't visit many amenities but the beach at Waikiki was quite packed, even though we went there around 8 AM on a Monday in September (three lines of parties at all times). No major complain but not exactly the impression/expectation of the islands.Show moreMGuest review byMiguelSpain8.0I think the biggest thing was the cost - the prices of food...I think the biggest thing was the cost - the prices of food and general goods have tripled since our last visit most people we spoke to said the same - I would say the visitor numbers were down possibly due to this - tours and experiences were expensive - the locals also said the same how they are struggling to live day to day.
The plastic used in Hawaii was excessive - there was nothing environmental about the place at all I did see some wildlife with lost legs and one bird had fishing twine and a bead wrapped around its leg - the poor thing was shivering but unfortunately I couldn't help it.Show moreJGuest review byJenniferNew Zealand10.0Great place to holiday with
