KKathleen JoyceFromPhilippinesLiked everything in this hotel! Staff are pleasant and always smiling, our room is super clean, and the swimming pool is super clean as well that the water is so clear! Location is near the waikiki beach and the Royal Hawaiian Center. Also liked that across the hotel is a public access to the beach which is not very crowded. We appreciated that they allow access to the washroom and on the eight floor even after we checked out while we are waiting for our flight.

RRobertFromJapanThe staff was friendly, helpful, and courteous.
The housekeeping staff was like a hive of bees.
They kept our room in tip-top shape, even when I tried to give them a break and told them that they could skip us for a day.
Also, they kept us plied with coffee, which was a delight for me.
The restaurant, the Maui Brewing Company, was superb.
There was an entrance directly from the hotel, and they supplied us with a discount card to sweeten the choice.
The location is in the heart of Waikiki.
It would be impossible not to love the positioning, as one is right in the heart of the city.Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 8.38.3Very Good - What previous guests thought, 1,813 reviewsVery Good 1,813 reviewsPrice from$2551 night, 2 adultsCheck availabilityHotel La CroixHotel in Waikiki, HonoluluHotel La Croix offers unobstructed views of the ocean, mountains, palm trees,or Waikiki city lights in every guest room.

Spreading along the white sandy beaches and supported by the strong back of the volcanic mountains, it's a real island paradise.Honolulu's most popular and famous district, Waikiki, features the stunning Waikiki Beach decorated with hundreds of surfboards, palms and lounge chairs. It‚Äôs also a center for the city‚Äôs nightlife and shopping, especially along Kalakaua and Kuhio Avenues.As the most popular activities in Honolulu include surfing, snorkeling, canoeing and other water sports, it's no surprise the city has a number of sandy beaches.

Reminded me of Shibuya or Osaka (also in part due to affluence of Japanese tourists). We didn't visit many amenities but the beach at Waikiki was quite packed, even though we went there around 8 AM on a Monday in September (three lines of parties at all times). No major complain but not exactly the impression/expectation of the islands.Show moreMGuest review byMiguelSpain8.0I think the biggest thing was the cost - the prices of food...I think the biggest thing was the cost - the prices of food and general goods have tripled since our last visit most people we spoke to said the same - I would say the visitor numbers were down possibly due to this - tours and experiences were expensive - the locals also said the same how they are struggling to live day to day.
The plastic used in Hawaii was excessive - there was nothing environmental about the place at all I did see some wildlife with lost legs and one bird had fishing twine and a bead wrapped around its leg - the poor thing was shivering but unfortunately I couldn't help it.Show moreJGuest review byJenniferNew Zealand10.0Great place to holiday with
