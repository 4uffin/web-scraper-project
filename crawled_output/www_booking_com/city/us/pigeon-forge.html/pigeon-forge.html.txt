Though ‘great’ is quite an understatement, as the sight of blue mist hovering above forested peaks is simply breathtaking.The most famous attraction is undoubtedly Dollywood, where a steam train puffs around a host of rides and shows in a theme park named after country legend Dolly Parton. Within the grounds is the Southern Gospel Museum and Hall of Fame, and next door are pools and waterslides at Dolly’s Splash Country.Cowboy boots should be at the ready for the singer’s Dixie Stampede dinner theatre and the Country Tonite Theater, and toe-tapping is also virtually guaranteed at the Grand Majestic Theater and Smoky Mountain Opry.The Old Mill is a wooden watermill on the Little Pigeon River, once part of a forge complex which sparked the town’s name. Also by the river are some Pigeon Forge outlet malls and the NASCAR SpeedPark which hosts car and truck events. The Elvis Museum houses memorabilia of ‘The King’ while the Titanic Museum is a floating, half-size replica of the doomed ship.This is just the tip of the iceberg and with Booking.com’s great deals on pet-friendly hotels and cheap motels on Pigeon Forge Parkway, you might just be tempted to do what the town’s sign requests: Y’all come back.Learn more about visiting Pigeon Forge112 attractions16 points of interestFind out moreWhat Guests Said About Pigeon Forge:10.0We stayed at this fantastic cabin for 2 wonderful days and...We stayed at this fantastic cabin for 2 wonderful days and absolute loved it. Cabin vibes, but actually feels like a house.
The cabin was cozy, clean and well-equipped, with everything you need for a comfortable stay. It’s in a beautiful location in the forest, but also very close to the main street in Pigeon Forge and only a short drive to Gatlinburg.
The host was very kind and had taken care of every little detail. Beautiful cabin house and we highly recommend itShow moreMGuest review byMortenDenmark8.0If you like Myrtle Beach, but you're more a mountains kind...If you like Myrtle Beach, but you're more a mountains kind of person than a beach person, Pigeon Forge is the place to visit. You can have all the carnival food, arcade, and mini-golf you could ever want, in a picturesque mountain town. As a Bonus, Pigeon Forge has Dollywood, which Myrtle Beach does NOT have. And there's more, too, than just the commercial touristy stuff! There's antiques shops, The Great Smoky Mountains hiking trails, and horseback riding, too. To be fair, horseback riding is definitely a touristy thing to do, but 10/10 I would do it again.Show moreSGuest review byStef_RVAUnited States8.0Pigeon Forge was very nice even got to see a car show.Pigeon Forge was very nice even got to see a car show.

Traffic is always backed up during that time so, if you are not interested in cars and traffic, check the dates to make sure you are not coming during that time. There is so much to do you really do not have to drive far to find a good place to eat, for entertainment, for shopping. The trolleys are always running, so you can ride pretty much anywhere and do not have to drive yourself.Show moreAGuest review byAmyUnited States8.0This place is nice when there isn't an event going on.This place is nice when there isn't an event going on.
