CCJFromSwitzerlandGreat place, cool interior design - functional and modern but yet with some really nice and surprising details. Friendly and helpful staff. We were on the 15th floor with a great view, but we never had to wait long for the elevators. Beds were really comfortable and the bathroom/shower practical and of good quality. Valet parkong is no bargain. We parked at Giants parking lot A just across the street (purchased the ticket ahead online) and used Uber to get around town. We would go back anytime.Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.29.2Superb - What previous guests thought, 1,344 reviewsSuperb 1,344 reviewsLocation 9.5Price from£391.961 night, 2 adultsCheck availabilitycitizenM San Francisco Union SquareHotel in Union Square, San FranciscoIdeally set in San Francisco, citizenM San Francisco Union Square features air-conditioned rooms, a shared lounge, free WiFi and a restaurant.

The food was excellent.
The quality of the food and beverages were exceptional! The morning dining room staff were professional and courteous and not intrusive to guests while dining. but, if you needed to order an item from the dine in menu the staff was there to take your order and worked efficiently.
The dining room was clean and setup lovely.
The staff always kept the food area replenished and very clean!
We also enjoyed the 24 hour availably for in room dining.
My husband and I will definitely be returning soon to stay at Hotel Drisco.
The 24 hour parlor room service with hot and cold beverages with light snacks was a welcome treat especially the biscotti!
Nice to come back to the Hotel and relax in the parlor room with a beverage and have a snack.
The selection of quality teas were very nice.

None better than the zig-zag Lombard Street seen in many a film. Other movie stars are the streetcars plying the hill climbs – a little touristy, but still worth trying.In the middle of the bay is Alcatraz island, famed for the notorious criminals once imprisoned there. Even if you don’t fancy going inside, the views towards the bridge and city are unparalleled.Nowhere in San Francisco is life more laidback than on the Pacific beaches. Hire a bike and head out there via the huge Golden Gate Park, before returning to sample some fresh seafood at Fisherman’s Wharf. The clam chowder served in (yes, actually in!) bread is a delight. Chinatown also has a great selection of good value restaurants.As you fly into San Francisco Airport, look out for the exclusive homes lining the Bay Area. Whether you want to stay in apartments along those lines, luxury San Francisco hotels or cheap hostels, Booking.com has something to suit. Be careful though – you might just leave your heart here.Learn more about visiting San Francisco774 attractions80 points of interest30 neighbourhoodsFind out moreWhat guests said about San Francisco:10.0We loved walking around the area.

The bad can be offset with personal attention to the areas where one goes and what one does when reacting to difficult physical and social circumstances
The city offers much to the visitor, especially history, art, science, ... , and a practicle experience in "social justice."
The bounds wealth and poverty are experienced and everything inbetween to the caring observer.
SF is what it is -- it is a city that Is "trying" to transform itself.

We heard that current mayor is trying to get things turned around. There were a lot of empty stores downtown, but shopping was better than expected. Still has some of the great restaurants from our visits many years ago - Scomas, Tadich Grill, Stinking Rose. It is still an interesting and beautiful city in many ways. The transportation to get around is still interesting with cable cars, trolleys and trains, and we felt safe. The hills are a challenge for walking great distances in a hurry. There are so many neighborhoods to explore, each with their own vibe. Loved the Italian area and sought out Graffeo Coffee Roasters, which is great! We had some great coffee at the Bohemian Cigar Store & Cafe. Best coffee ever in the Italian sense. We love the Buena Vista Bar was still there and serves a great breakfast (recommended by firemen) as well as their wonderful Irish coffee. We had a lovely meal with beautiful view and good food at McCormick & Schmick’s at Ghirardelli Square. Magnin Street Cafe & Bistro was a fun find. We ate there 2 evenings. Loved the Bistro Boudin on the Wharf. The food and service were great. Unexpected. Beautiful dining above the bakery area. Serve lunch and dinner. Had a view as well. The weather was almost perfect.

I found this to be great value compared to other hotels nearby and I liked the historic character of the hotel. The staff were very welcoming and offered advice on what to see and do in the area. The bed was very comfortable and the room was spacious. There was complementary tea and coffee provided in the lobby.Show moreAGuest review byAlastairUnited KingdomOrchard HotelUnion Square, San FranciscoFrom £227.56 per nightScored out of 10, guest rating 8.88.8Fabulous - What previous guests thought, 1,789 reviews Fabulous · 1,789 reviewsWe had stayed at The Orchard Hotel on our first visit to San Francisco and we decided to stay here again on our second visit. We love the location of the hotel (near Union Square, shops, restaurants, cable car, all transportation and even within walking distance of rental car offices). The hotel itself has a subtle luxury and is very comfortable. Staff is very polite and accommodating.Show moreLGuest review byLemonia NitsaGreeceStaypineapple, An Elegant Hotel, Union SquareUnion Square, San FranciscoFrom £177.89 per nightScored out of 10, guest rating 8.18.1Very good - What previous guests thought, 1,099 reviews Very good · 1,099 reviewsIt's a beautiful property with wonderful staff.

The location was great....close to Union Square, good shopping, and Swan Oyster Depot (my favorite restaurant). Lots of options around the hotel to hop on BART and explore other areas of the city too!
