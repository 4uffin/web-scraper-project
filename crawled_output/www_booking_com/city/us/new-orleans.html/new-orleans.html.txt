Louisiana’s largest city, the Big Easy is the beating heart of the Deep South.Dance down Bourbon Street, where jazz saxophones ring out of traditional bars mixed with more colorful nightlife and entertainment venues. There are several New Orleans hotels near Bourbon Street, spread around the French Quarter with its distinctive Creole architecture.To the south is Jackson Square, dominated by St. Louis Cathedral. Horses and carts wait patiently by the square, and locals set up their stools and start playing catchy tunes. Just behind is the legendary Mississippi River whose waters are still plied by paddle steamers.From the river you get great views of the CBD (downtown) skyscrapers and the Louisiana Superdome. Booking.com has several hotels nearby, including some on Canal Street, where streetcars and the famous New Orleans Mardi Gras carnival pass down.In the northern suburbs is New Orleans City Park, one of the oldest US parks and larger than NYC’s Central Park. Waterways lining it flow into large Lake Pontchartrain bordered by a bayou.Learn more about visiting New Orleans574 attractions75 points of interest10 neighborhoodsFind out moreWhat Guests Said About New Orleans:10.0Always an experience to visit New Orleans!Always an experience to visit New Orleans!
See the usual such as Bourbon Street and Cafe du Monde but this time I visited the Mardi Gras World where they make the floats for the parades - and for other companies as well. It was well worth it!
The guide was so fun and it was a super nice time.
They even come and pick you up and then took as far as they could to the French Quarter!
We rode the hop on hop off bus and that was a good deal as well. The guide on this was super informative. Lots of great information.
I was disappointed that it cost so much to get in to the cemetery and did not partake of that due to cost and timing.
Was very pleased with Mulate's restaurant close to the convention center.
Food was wonderful!
And a little place called Cochon Butcher was unique!
Take advantage of the trolley - 40 cents for seniors!Show morePGuest review byPatUnited States8.0The city is beautiful.The city is beautiful. We were two streets away from French Street,
two blocks from Bourbon Street and a few blocks from all the restaurants, stores, and activity on Decatur Street.
It was hotter than we anticipated for mid-September so some of the outdoor activities we put off until the evening.
The Hop on Hop off Bus for was excellent,
and convenient. There was a great deal of construction on Decatur Street making it a bit more difficult to freely move around in some areas and caused traffic to be rerouted to other side streets.
I didn't take photos in that area due to the disruption, but didn't take away from enjoying the offerings.Show moreEGuest review byElizabethUnited States10.0This visit included some time spent in the Marigny and...This visit included some time spent in the Marigny and Bywater areas, for the music on Frenchman street and the cafes and a bakery at Washington Square.

The room was comfortable, particularly the bed but the room did not always get serviced - it was a bit hit and miss to be honest. The hot water was also sporadic and showers were often cold or lukewarm.
There is music in the hotel every night until at least midnight so don’t stay if you like an early night.
