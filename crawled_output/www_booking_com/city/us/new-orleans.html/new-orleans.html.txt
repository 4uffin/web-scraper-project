Louisiana’s largest city, the Big Easy is the beating heart of the Deep South.Dance down Bourbon Street, where jazz saxophones ring out of traditional bars mixed with more colorful nightlife and entertainment venues. There are several New Orleans hotels near Bourbon Street, spread around the French Quarter with its distinctive Creole architecture.To the south is Jackson Square, dominated by St. Louis Cathedral. Horses and carts wait patiently by the square, and locals set up their stools and start playing catchy tunes. Just behind is the legendary Mississippi River whose waters are still plied by paddle steamers.From the river you get great views of the CBD (downtown) skyscrapers and the Louisiana Superdome. Booking.com has several hotels nearby, including some on Canal Street, where streetcars and the famous New Orleans Mardi Gras carnival pass down.In the northern suburbs is New Orleans City Park, one of the oldest US parks and larger than NYC’s Central Park. Waterways lining it flow into large Lake Pontchartrain bordered by a bayou.Learn more about visiting New Orleans575 attractions75 points of interest10 neighborhoodsFind out moreWhat Guests Said About New Orleans:8.0The city is beautiful.The city is beautiful.

The Hop on Hop off Bus for was excellent,
and convenient. There was a great deal of construction on Decatur Street making it a bit more difficult to freely move around in some areas and caused traffic to be rerouted to other side streets.
