There are several New Orleans hotels near Bourbon Street, spread around the French Quarter with its distinctive Creole architecture.To the south is Jackson Square, dominated by St. Louis Cathedral.

See the usual such as Bourbon Street and Cafe du Monde but this time I visited the Mardi Gras World where they make the floats for the parades - and for other companies as well. It was well worth it!
The guide was so fun and it was a super nice time.
They even come and pick you up and then took as far as they could to the French Quarter!
We rode the hop on hop off bus and that was a good deal as well. The guide on this was super informative. Lots of great information.
I was disappointed that it cost so much to get in to the cemetery and did not partake of that due to cost and timing.
Was very pleased with Mulate's restaurant close to the convention center.
Food was wonderful!
And a little place called Cochon Butcher was unique!
Take advantage of the trolley - 40 cents for seniors!Show morePGuest review byPatUnited States8.0The city is beautiful.The city is beautiful. We were two streets away from French Street,
two blocks from Bourbon Street and a few blocks from all the restaurants, stores, and activity on Decatur Street.
It was hotter than we anticipated for mid-September so some of the outdoor activities we put off until the evening.
The Hop on Hop off Bus for was excellent,
and convenient. There was a great deal of construction on Decatur Street making it a bit more difficult to freely move around in some areas and caused traffic to be rerouted to other side streets.
I didn't take photos in that area due to the disruption, but didn't take away from enjoying the offerings.Show moreEGuest review byElizabethUnited States10.0This visit included some time spent in the Marigny and...This visit included some time spent in the Marigny and Bywater areas, for the music on Frenchman street and the cafes and a bakery at Washington Square.
