AND IM STILL TRYING TO GET MY REFUND FROM THIS PROPERTY!!Show moreJGuest review byJuneUnited States10.0What a city!What a city! This southeastern city in Northeast Florida is a city of land, sea, and large rivers. There are several areas of water, beaches, biking, camping, shopping, and eating activities. This is an affordable city to vacation in. Plan to visit a thought-provoking museum like MOSH, The Ritz, The Cummer, and religious institutions. There is an Under The Bridge shopping area, for locally produced items made up of materials and foods. You may sit there at the Saint Johns River and listen to weekly music or local presentations. This city has numerous institutions of higher learning. Visit a campus for an informal tour or attend an event. Be sure to visit one or more of our distinct neighborhoods.
Come and find your place in this city of beauty and outdoor activities.Show moreEGuest review byElizabethUnited States10.0I love Jacksonville because it's not too far from where we...I love Jacksonville because it's not too far from where we live to just take a ride and just get away lots to do my husband and children.
