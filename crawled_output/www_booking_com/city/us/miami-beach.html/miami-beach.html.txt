Popular as a spring break destination, its miles of pristine sands shelve gently into the turquoise Atlantic Ocean.Lining the beach are tall palm trees and the promenade, famous for the beautiful people that go rollerblading by. Add to this a warm, subtropical climate and you can see why many
celebrities have chosen to set up home in Miami Beach.You might even spot some of them shopping in the designer boutiques along Lincoln Road. And if your budget doesn’t quite stretch that far, there’s still a great range of shops with more moderate prices, including Aventura Mall and CocoWalk.The city also has its fair share of culture, including the Art Deco District, which houses the world’s largest collection of Art Deco architecture, including some of the brightly-lit Miami Beach hotels on Ocean Drive. Comprising a series of islands just across Biscayne Bay from Miami (the route you take from Miami Airport), this city has a heavy Latin American influence, which is evident in the cuisine and fantastic nightlife. Whether you choose the Miami Beach accommodation in the North Beach, Mid Beach or South Beach areas, a Cuba Libre - rum and coke - is never far away.Learn more about visiting Miami Beach857 attractions21 points of interest6 neighbourhoodsFind out moreWhat guests said about Miami Beach:10.0My group was there mid September, the weather was good, low...My group was there mid September, the weather was good, low to mid 80s so not horribly hot.

Which was recommended by the car rental place due to lots of rain before we arrived and flooding. The weather ended up really nice and we still were able to ride with the top down. I learned to uber to and from the rental car building from the airport because its a long walk!
Uber/Lyft was less expensive than a cab.
It's also a 2.5 mile walk if you are going to Uber to the Dolphins game. Getting in wasn't bad but leaving was horrible. Got great ticket prices on stub hub an hour before the game.
