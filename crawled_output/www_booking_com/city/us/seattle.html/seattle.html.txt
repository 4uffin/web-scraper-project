Standing proudly at 600 feet, this major landmark features a rotating restaurant at 490 feet and has been featured in numerous films and TV shows, including the classic "Sleepless in Seattle."The Needle isn't far from the popular Pike Place Market, a public farmer’s market selling fresh produce and crafts from local farms and independent merchants. It’s also the place where the Starbucks Corporation was founded in 1971. Enjoy a cup of coffee in their original store!

Positives - I had heard there was a major homeless problem here, but we did not encounter much at all near the tourist areas were we stayed.
Pretty place on the water with many options to do like taking a ferry to Bainbridge, Pike Market and the 3 attraction spaced close together by Space Needle.
Negative - The food was soooo overpriced where $25 burgers are the norm.
Service fees really irked me where you receive your bill and there is a mandatory 5% service fee that states this does not go to the server but is used for rising costs (then add it to the prices instead of doing it this way).Show moreMGuest review byMichaelUnited States10.0Wondeful places to visit including plke street market,...Wondeful places to visit including plke street market, flowers fish and totally unique stalls and shops.
