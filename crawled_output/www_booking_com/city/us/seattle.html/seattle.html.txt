The hotel's warm ambiance, modern design, and prime location make it an ideal choice for travelers seeking a stylish and comfortable stay in the heart of Seattle.
My room was a haven of comfort, with an incredibly plush bed and exceptional soundproofing. The hotel's cleanliness was impeccable, and the staff consistently demonstrated genuine care for guests.
The breakfast buffet was a culinary delight, offering a delightful array of sweet and savory treats. The hotel's location, close to Pike Place Market, the Space Needle, and Amazon headquarters, made exploring the city a breeze.

In reality though, the city gets less rain a year than New York or Atlanta!One look at Seattle’s skyline and you’re immediately drawn to the iconic Space Needle. Standing proudly at 600 feet, this major landmark features a rotating restaurant at 490 feet and has been featured in numerous films and TV shows, including the classic "Sleepless in Seattle."The Needle isn't far from the popular Pike Place Market, a public farmer’s market selling fresh produce and crafts from local farms and independent merchants. It’s also the place where the Starbucks Corporation was founded in 1971. Enjoy a cup of coffee in their original store!
Seattle has many popular parks and, thanks to its mild marine climate, is a great place for outdoor activities. A visit to Kerry Park to admire the best view of the city with Mt. Rainier in the background is a must!Arriving at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, you’re only about 35 minutes from downtown and whether you’re looking for a hotel with free parking or near the airport, Booking.com has a great choice for your Seattle trip.Learn more about visiting Seattle346 attractions61 points of interest25 neighborhoodsFind out moreWhat Guests Said About Seattle:8.0It was vibrant & young city & good food & lots of place to...It was vibrant & young city & good food & lots of place to see & easy walking with good views.

Positives - I had heard there was a major homeless problem here, but we did not encounter much at all near the tourist areas were we stayed.
Pretty place on the water with many options to do like taking a ferry to Bainbridge, Pike Market and the 3 attraction spaced close together by Space Needle.
Negative - The food was soooo overpriced where $25 burgers are the norm.
Service fees really irked me where you receive your bill and there is a mandatory 5% service fee that states this does not go to the server but is used for rising costs (then add it to the prices instead of doing it this way).Show moreMGuest review byMichaelUnited States10.0Wondeful places to visit including plke street market,...Wondeful places to visit including plke street market, flowers fish and totally unique stalls and shops.
