JJoanneFromUnited KingdomMyself and my friend did not have breakfast during our stay.
I did love this hotel though, the location was perfect, the free parking was welcome. All the staff we encountered were helpful and friendly. What I enjoyed the most was the hotel felt quirky in a good way, the room was old fashioned but I loved that and we both enjoyed the rocking chairs on the balcony.
I would have no problem recommending this hotel and if I’m lucky enough to come back to Gatlinburg I would not hesitate to stay here again.Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.09.0Superb - What previous guests thought, 2,121 reviewsSuperb 2,121 reviewsLocation 9.9Price from£101.721 night, 2 adultsCheck availabilityEmbassy Suites By Hilton Gatlinburg ResortHotel in GatlinburgSet in Gatlinburg, 1.3 km from Ober Gatlinburg, Embassy Suites By Hilton Gatlinburg Resort offers accommodation with a shared lounge, private parking and a bar.
