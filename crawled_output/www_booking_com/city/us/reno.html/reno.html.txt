Within minutes of landing at Reno-Tahoe Airport you can be hearing the dinging of slot machines on Virginia Street where a glowing neon arch welcomes you to ‘The Biggest Little City in the World’.Across the plaza is Harrah’s Reno, just one casino hotel available on Booking.com. Larger casinos with spas, such as Peppermill and Atlantis, are off the main strip. The largest is the Grand Sierra Resort with its own amusement park, large pool and night club. Pet-friendly motels and cheap hostels are other options.Aside from gambling, the city hosts many events including the Reno River Festival in Wingfield Park. The Truckee River Walk connects shops, restaurants and bars popular with students at the nearby University of Nevada, the state’s oldest. The campus includes the Mackay Stadium and Fleischmann Science Center and Planetarium, set opposite the arboretum of Rancho San Rafael Park.The Nevada Museum of Art is in Reno and neighbouring Sparks has a Heritage Museum. The 2 cities share a convention centre and livestock events centre, and there are many golf courses in their green surroundings. Even lusher are the Sierra Nevada mountains, whose peaks around Lake Tahoe offer some of the best US skiing.Learn more about visiting Reno32 attractions20 points of interest4 neighborhoodsFind out moreWhat Guests Said About Reno:10.0I always like Reno since my son lived here all his life and...I always like Reno since my son lived here all his life and died here so I will always visit Reno until the day I

The murals are great, but overall the streets are not welcoming. The park along the Truckee River was a nice start, but it needs more. Midtown Reno seemed nicer - but "nice" in the way of a suburban town, rather than a vacation destination. The best part of our stay was when we accidentally stumbled across a dress rehearsal of the Nevada Dance Company in front of the Pioneer Center.
