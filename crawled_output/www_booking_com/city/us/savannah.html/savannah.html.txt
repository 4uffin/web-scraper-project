Close enough to walk to everything, but there is a free DOT bus if you prefer. Nice breakfast served out on the porch of the Inn (weather permitting).
Tons of restaurants down by the river and throughout the historic district. Lots of history and sites to see.

We have stayed in almost all of the B&Bs in the historic district as well as many of the hotels and even some 2 and 3 bedroom VRBO offerings. Once we get to Savannah the idea is to park the car and not get back in a vehicle until the day we leave. This is a great walking town and we always have felt safe wandering around the squares, going in and out of stores and eating establishments, and enjoying some of the nightlife. River Street and Bay street shops are a bit touristy but still are a lot of fun. Avoid chain restaurants (not many of those anyway) and go to great places like Fiddlers and Pirate House for seafood, Vics on the River and Bella Napoli for fine dining, and Treylor Park (Bay St), Seafood Shack or Common on Broughton for great lunch options. Don't forget Lulu's Chocolate Bar for desserts and yummy martinis. If you get tired walking, a PediCab is a great way to get around.Show moreDGuest review byDianeUnited States10.0Great city with a lot of history.
