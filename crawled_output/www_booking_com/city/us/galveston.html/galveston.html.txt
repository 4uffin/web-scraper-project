MM.E.FromNetherlandsWe decided to leave the hotel we had booked earlier because we had a very unpleasant situation there.
So we booked this hotel instead. What a fabtastic decision!
It was clean, spacious, comfortable and the nice lady at the reception gave us an upgrade to a room with beauful ocean views. Staff of this hotel were even apologetic for the bad experience we had in the other place in Galveston.
Right across the beach at a great location!Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.19.1Superb - What previous guests thought, 184 reviewsSuperb 184 reviewsLocation 9.3Price from£114.291 night, 2 adultsCheck availabilityThe Tremont House, Galveston, a Tribute Portfolio HotelHotel in The Strand - Downtown, GalvestonThe Tremont House, Galveston, a Tribute Portfolio Hotel is just 5 minutes’ drive from Galveston Beach.

SSTEPHANIEFromUnited StatesI stayed here the night before my cruise. It is a small hotel that really felt more like having my own room in someone’s home. It is comfortable, quiet, safe, easy to get in and out of. And the price is right. It has a nice outside seating area if you want to hang out with friends and enjoy the sea air. It is walking distance to the strand and if I hadn’t been alone I would have taken advantage of that. It is also very close to the cruise port, which was nice. I got to the port in less than 5 minutes. I had questions upon checking in and the owner was responsive, even though not on site. I had already reserved this room for a November cruise and very pleased that I did. I will definitely continue to use this hotel in the future.Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.09.0Superb - What previous guests thought, 70 reviewsSuperb 70 reviewsLocation 9.4Price from£122.291 night, 2 adultsCheck availabilityThe Oleander Hotel Room Number 1Hotel in East End, GalvestonLocated in Galveston, 1.9 km from Seawall Urban Park, The Oleander Hotel Room Number 1 provides accommodation with a fitness centre, free private parking and a terrace.

Maceos also has really good lunches.

We tend to take it for granted.
Of course there are more beautiful beaches, but Galveston is full of a lifetime of memories for us, so we love it.
After school starts, it's a perfect place to spend a weekend.
Full of southern charm and stories about pirates and wiseguys, it's a fun place to get to know BOTIs (born on the island) and newcomers.
Not to mention the great seafood and fishing.
And our beloved dreadnought, The Battleship Texas, BB35, will be permanently moored there next year.
Something for everyone.Show moreJGuest review byJulieUnited States10.0Galveston is a fun place to visit.Galveston is a fun place to visit. Its a short drive to the Ferry to Bolivar and Crystal beach. There are several good restaurants to choose from. The only downfall is that you have to pay to park along the seawall. We ate at the Golden coral and although it is a small one compared to others the variety was still good.Show moreKGuest review byKimberley8.0Easy access to the beach.Easy access to the beach. Plenty of things along the seawall to do and see. People were friendly and informative. Historical museums were cool. The dolphin boat tour and haunted boat tours by dolphin bay watch were awesome. Watch out where you park though, if its before 6pm make sure you pay through app or kiosk. I saw cars with tickets so be careful and set alarms so you make sure you are back at your vehicle on time or just extend your time that's what we did. Like that traffic wasn't horrible.
