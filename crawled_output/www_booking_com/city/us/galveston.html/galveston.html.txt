Blvd Seafood on the Seawall is a great place to eat & Rudy & Pico has really good lunch specials.
Maceos also has really good lunches.
The island has alot of transportation, such as trolleys, uber & lyft.
Because Galveston is a island, you will see homeless people.
During events, there are alot of people having a good time, but it's best to uber or lyft.Show moreJGuest review byJackie10.0We don't live in Galveston but have lived nearby our whole...We don't live in Galveston but have lived nearby our whole lives.
We tend to take it for granted.
Of course there are more beautiful beaches, but Galveston is full of a lifetime of memories for us, so we love it.
After school starts, it's a perfect place to spend a weekend.
Full of southern charm and stories about pirates and wiseguys, it's a fun place to get to know BOTIs (born on the island) and newcomers.
Not to mention the great seafood and fishing.
And our beloved dreadnought, The Battleship Texas, BB35, will be permanently moored there next year.
Something for everyone.Show moreJGuest review byJulieUnited States10.0Galveston is a fun place to visit.Galveston is a fun place to visit. Its a short drive to the Ferry to Bolivar and Crystal beach.
