Free Wi-Fi is also provided. LLuzelleFromPhilippinesWe left Houston because power was out due to Beryl. All the hotels in Houston were all booked. We decided to go to Austin since the 2 hotels we previously tried to book cancelled at the last minute. We have not been to Austin before, we were tired and anxious that the hotel would be full. Also, we tried buying a generator but it was out of stock everywhere. It was our first hurricane experience..So we decided to travel to Austin.
We were so happy and relieved that there was room for us and that the people (the staff and the folks in general) were warm, welcoming and friendly! The room was amazing, it was bigger than any of the hotels we've ever been! The wifi was strong and they had blessed AC! They offer free bfast which was very filling, laundry for guests, gym and pool as well. Parking was free and plenty but kinda tight fit. We wont hesitate to go back!Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.09.0Wonderful - What previous guests thought, 1,029 reviewsWonderful 1,029 reviewsLocation 9.0Price from$102.991 night, 2 adultsCheck availabilityHoliday Inn Express & Suites Austin Airport East by IHGHotel in AustinLocated in Austin, 7.4 miles from Circuit of the Americas, Holiday Inn Express & Suites Austin Airport East by IHG has accommodations with a seasonal outdoor swimming pool, free private parking, a...DDANIEL FromTaiwanAll is good, clean and shuttle service is awesomeShow moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.29.2Wonderful - What previous guests thought, 169 reviewsWonderful 169 reviewsLocation 9.1Price from$120.601 night, 2 adultsCheck availabilityHampton by Hilton East Austin - near UT and CapitolHotel in East Austin, AustinLocated in Austin, 1.8 miles from Austin Convention Center, Hampton by Hilton East Austin - near UT and Capitol has accommodations with an outdoor swimming pool, private parking, a fitness center and...AAngelinaFromUnited StatesI loved the room very comfortable, the free breakfast was cool and coincidentally free lunch.
