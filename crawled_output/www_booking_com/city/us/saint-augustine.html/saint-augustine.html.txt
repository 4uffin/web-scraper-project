We were pleasantly surprised. We chose to go in September which is the "slow" part of the year but it gave us plenty of time to enjoy the city. We took the shuttle from Southern Oaks Inn to the historical district most days. We walked, we shopped, and we enjoyed time being together. We took the "Hop On - Hop Off" shuttle once we were in the historical district. The drivers were knowledgeable and entertaining. We toured the Castillo de San Marcos Fortress, Cathedral Basilica of St. Augustine, and a sunset cruise on the Black Raven. Very enjoyable trip!Show moreDGuest review byDeboraUnited States10.0As a native Floridian, I almost feel embarrassed to admit...As a native Floridian, I almost feel embarrassed to admit that his was my first trip to St. Augustine.
