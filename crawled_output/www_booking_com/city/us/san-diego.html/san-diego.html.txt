Its wonderful beaches and mild climate make it a favorite spring break destination, and with over 40 city breweries, there are plenty of ice cold beers to set the mood. The city’s most recognizable landmark is the Hotel del Coronado, a wooden Victorian beach resort, now a National Historic Landmark. As original Spanish mission and first in California, it's has been relocated to the Mission Valley area, and Old Town San Diego still has many Colonial buildings and quirky shops. Also great for shopping are Horton Plaza and the boutiques in the beachfront neighborhoods.The city’s most famous attraction is its zoo in Balboa Park, a few blocks from San Diego International Airport. One of the world’s largest zoos, it is well worth a visit, as is the fantastic SeaWorld, home to several killer whales. To see wildlife in its natural habitat head to La Jolla beach where harbor seals rest, or watch whales in season from Point Loma Lighthouse.Just over the border from Mexico’s Tijuana, San Diego has a distinctly Latin American vibe and a variety of accommodations encompassing apartments, motels, B&Bs and hotels.

The building door was held open with trash. Homeless guy was undressing outside the building.
The SD police was ticketing all the vehicles in front of the VRBO (it wasn’t a hotel as I expected).
The non-US person answering the phone told me I could not check in at 2:30pm.
There was NO security there and any of the homeless around the place could attack anyone who just opens their door.
There was no place to park either. I did not stay there.
I had to scramble to find another place and not use Booking.com, they don’t say it is a VRBO until after the booking.

Recommend: the USS Midway museum; if you're into war history and Naval ships. Have a stroll on the bayfront a lot of maritime traffic to observe.
Grab a baseball game: if you're in season, just for the stadium experience,
Visit Balboa park and its museums. Grab dinner in Little Italy.
