Its wonderful beaches and mild climate make it a favorite spring break destination, and with over 40 city breweries, there are plenty of ice cold beers to set the mood. The city’s most recognizable landmark is the Hotel del Coronado, a wooden Victorian beach resort, now a National Historic Landmark. As original Spanish mission and first in California, it's has been relocated to the Mission Valley area, and Old Town San Diego still has many Colonial buildings and quirky shops. Also great for shopping are Horton Plaza and the boutiques in the beachfront neighborhoods.The city’s most famous attraction is its zoo in Balboa Park, a few blocks from San Diego International Airport. One of the world’s largest zoos, it is well worth a visit, as is the fantastic SeaWorld, home to several killer whales. To see wildlife in its natural habitat head to La Jolla beach where harbor seals rest, or watch whales in season from Point Loma Lighthouse.Just over the border from Mexico’s Tijuana, San Diego has a distinctly Latin American vibe and a variety of accommodations encompassing apartments, motels, B&Bs and hotels.

Great weather, friendly people, felt very safe walking about. A few homeless people, but they seem to keep themselves to themselves. Easy to get around on the new trams. Busses are $2.50 flat fare, reliable and plentiful. And train services across California.
Compact city, so quick to get around. The harbour front is great with a long promenade from the airport all the way to Seaport Village, with great views, and plenty of restaurants. Can recommend the seafood at the "Dockside" upstairs near the Star of India sailing ship. Also walked to downtown and found a great cafe "The Corner Bakery Cafe" on Broadway, fantastic food! We visited the USS Midway Aircraft Carrier, amazing, and took a 2 hour harbour with Flagship Cruises. Also took the Trolley Tour hop on and off bus with commentary. It visits all the main attractions on a loop service, great for first time to get to know the area. Be sure to pick up leaflets with discount vouchers in many food outlets. At the harbour front there is a kiosk where you can get discounts on some attractions.
Went to the zoo which was a great day out. I'd not seen Polar Bears or Pandas before. The Orang-Utans were hilarious!
You must also visit Coronado Island, great food and beaches. Easy to reach by bus via the toll free bridge.Show moreDGuest review byDerek MaltUnited Kingdom10.0I just love Petco park and the entire area of Old Town, Gas...I just love Petco park and the entire area of Old Town, Gas Lamp, Little Italy and the Embarcadero! Embarcadero is a great place to casually skate around by the ocean or bring your bicycle!
It is all right there within a short trolly hop or walk. There are so many places to go for a great, happy and friendly experience.
I love all the art all over the city. Everything is so colorful, clean and fresh.
If someone is bored here, then they just are not a happy person.
San Diego did such a fantastic job with this area & the Padres have brought so many great opportunities and happiness for people. This is how you make a great city!
