With temperatures of 100F and 87% humidity it was too hot to do many of the things we would have liked.
However a carriage ride around the French Quarter, with Palmetto Carriages' knowledgeable driver Elliot, gave us a taste of this historical district.
Would recommend Anson Cafe (actually a big restaurant) near the market.
Lovely food and excellent service.
And of course, the French Quarter Inn.
Spend time in the four buildings of The Market and buy authentic Benne Wafers from Southern Sisters.Show morePGuest review byPatriciaUnited KingdomSee reviews by guests who stayed at hotels in CharlestonSee allHotel EmelineHistoric District, CharlestonFrom $593.61 per nightScored out of 10, guest rating 8.98.9Excellent - What previous guests thought, 736 reviews Excellent · 736 reviewsEmeline was really nice and modern with a beautiful courtyard.
