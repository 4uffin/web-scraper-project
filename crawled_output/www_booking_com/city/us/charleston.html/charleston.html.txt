With temperatures of 100F and 87% humidity it was too hot to do many of the things we would have liked.
However a carriage ride around the French Quarter, with Palmetto Carriages' knowledgeable driver Elliot, gave us a taste of this historical district.
Would recommend Anson Cafe (actually a big restaurant) near the market.
Lovely food and excellent service.
And of course, the French Quarter Inn.
