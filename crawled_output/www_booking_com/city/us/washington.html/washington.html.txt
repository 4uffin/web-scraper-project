Most visitors start at the National Mall, a huge park stretching from the Potomac River to the Capitol Building. It also encompasses the Washington Monument obelisk and the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool, of particular significance in US civil rights, commemorated by the latest addition - the Martin Luther King Memorial.Also here are 11 of the city’s 17 incredible Smithsonian museums, including the unmissable National Museum of American History.If all this gets too much, wander around Georgetown’s Colonial buildings and take a break in one of the student cafés. Many world cuisines are represented in Washington DC and the city also has its fair share of live music venues, with a surprisingly good jazz scene. The National Symphony Orchestra is based here and the Kennedy Center hosts a range of productions.DC’s planning policy means there are no skyscrapers, so if you fly into Washingon Dulles Airport over the city, you see its white buildings standing proud. The city is also served by Baltimore-Washington Thurgood Marshall Airport and Washington National Airport. All are quite a way out, so leave plenty of time to get there from your hotel, apartment or guest house booked through Booking.com.Learn more about visiting Washington635 attractions85 points of interest18 neighbourhoodsFind out moreWhat guests said about Washington:10.0We love the tours that we took of the We also got to take...We love the tours that we took of the We also got to take the engraving and printing of money.
