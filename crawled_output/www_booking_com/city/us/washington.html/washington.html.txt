Room was comfortable, initially was a bit disappointed since we got a room with no view BUT in the end it was ok because it was a quiet area, we were undisturbed and we got the best night's sleep on all the days we were staying here. The staff were welcoming especially Ermelita and Mary from the FD. The location is wonderful - very close to the White House, lots of restaurants in the general area, Museums are a few mins walk. Felt very safe in the neighborhood and the hotel.Show moreCGuest review byCYRPhilippinesThe Eldon Luxury SuitesNorthwest, Washington, D.C.Scored out of 10, guest rating 8.28.2Very Good - What previous guests thought, 1,284 reviews Very Good¬†¬∑¬†1,284 reviewsThe apartment was much bigger than expected - comfortable, lots of room, kitchen area so we could cater for ourselves with breakfast and some evenings which makes things so much easier - and cheaper.
