We loved Mel’s diner with the singing servers!!!They were all so talented and sweet! The Christian bookstore
behind Mel’s diner was a great find with a wonderful selection of gifts. The 50’s diner with the drive in behind and the jukebox was a hit. It was like stepping back in time.

There is so much to do in the area including: music/variety/magic shows, museums, several shopping centers, souvenir shops, mini-golf, go-carts, a wide variety of quality restaurants, the original ferris-wheel from the Navy Pier in Chicago, Historic Downtown Branson, zoos, the Branson Belle Dinner Cruise Showboat, Silver Dollar City Amusement Park....among many other attractions.
There is a wide variety of accommodations to choose from as well, from inexpensive budget motels to high-end luxury hotels...along with condos, town-homes, B&Bs and VRBOs.
The only downside (for me) is that there are only a handful (or less) of local, "neighborhood-type" bars that aren't part of a larger restaurant. In fact, I've only found 3...and they're kind-of "hidden gems".Show morePGuest review byParrotHeadUnited StatesSee reviews by guests who stayed at hotels in BransonSee allBaymont by Wyndham Branson Thousand HillsBransonFrom $107.12 per nightScored out of 10, guest rating 8.18.1Very Good - What previous guests thought, 162 reviews Very Good · 162 reviewsChecked in late, room and bed clean.
