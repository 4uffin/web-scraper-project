MarcuapFromPhilippinesThe main reason I booked this hotel is its proximity to MIT campus. The campus is literally just across the bridge that connects Cambridge and Boston, and this bridge is just a quick 5-minute walk from the hotel. I was surprised to know that it's also located at the end of this nice shopping street that's lined up with dozens of shops and restaurants. The best part is that this street leads to Boston Commons all the way to Quincy Market and the harbor area, and so I really had a good time walking this street both day and night. The hotel's lobby is so modern yet cozy with plenty of seating spaces where you can hang out with friends. The restaurant and bar is also super nice and offers a wonderful buffet breakfast for around 25 USD. The room I'd say was perfectly designed with many lighting options. There's a switch by the door when you're exiting the room that turns off all the lights which I think was very eco friendly. The bed was huge and comfy too. I find the self check in and check out very cool as well. It was my first time to make my own room key card! The shower area in the room is also one of my favorite part about this hotel as they have two shower gels, one for day time and one for night time, and they both smell incredibly soothing! Wifi worked perfectly during my stay.Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.09.0Wonderful - What previous guests thought, 2,640 reviewsWonderful 2,640 reviewsPrice from$1851 night, 2 adultsCheck availabilityCanopy By Hilton Boston DowntownHotel in Downtown Boston, BostonWell situated in Boston, Canopy By Hilton Boston Downtown has air-conditioned rooms, free bikes and a fitness center.

In its heart, next to 18th-century Faneuil Hall, is Quince Market - a food haven. In the nearby seaport, you can take a whale-watching trip or dine at one of the many restaurants serving a Boston specialty: lobster with melted butter. The streets south of the peaceful Charles River in Back Bay are lined with Victorian brownstone houses. At the downtown end of one – Beacon Street – is the Cheers bar, modeled on the 80's sitcom. Opposite is Boston Common, a large park with a bronze sculpture celebrating the book "Make Way for Ducklings". The golden dome of the House of Representatives is by the other end. The oldest part is Charlestown and streets around the Bunker Hill obelisk still feature old-style gas lamps, though now they are electric. Over in Cambridge, Harvard is the USA’s oldest and most prestigious university. The campus is open to the public, as is Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), whose central point is an emblematic, Pantheon-like building.Sport in Boston is also a big thing, with the Celtics and Red Sox among the city’s big name teams.The largest New England city, Boston has the perfect size for walking and cycling. Logan International Airport is connected by public transport to Boston hotels, motels, apartments and B&Bs.Learn more about visiting Boston434 attractions69 points of interest19 neighborhoodsFind out moreWhat Guests Said About Boston:10.0Seriously….the best city break ever!Seriously….the best city break ever!

There are so many things to see and so many interesting buildings, people, artwork, architecture, parks, etc. that you could really enjoy this city endlessly. It is calm and serene in the early morning, bustling and exciting in the a.m. as people go to work, it remains exciting throughout the day. The nighttime is a whole new environment with reflections of buildings on water features and rivers and marquees and signs and nightlife lighting up ... and as the night dies down and the crowds die down, the peace returns. There are all kinds of hardworking people moving about all throughout the day. People are walking dogs, lots of students. Lots of international students and visitors and residents - you hear the conversations - it is exciting and reminiscent of Europe. There are parts of Boston that feel like Europe and other parts that are very cutting edge. There seems to be lots of live music, lots of cafes, lots of food choices and many places to shop; you can get almost anything you need or want in this city. It's a fantastic city.
