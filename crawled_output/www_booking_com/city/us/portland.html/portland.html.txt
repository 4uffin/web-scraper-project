Arrived at noon and asked to leave my bags so I could just walk around the lake and get some air. A combination of snow and feeling unsafe in the city meant I had nothing to really do before I flew the following day. The guys on reception not only checked me in early, but upgraded me to a king sized bed for free! The room was exactly what I wanted, it was homely and comfortable with all the amenities, and WARM. This was something a high end competition in the city failed miserably on.
The staff were all friendly, I booked my air port bus ride, it felt very safe for a solo traveller and the food and drink at the restaurant was amazing. I could not recommend this hotel highly enough with the care that they give to travellers.Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 8.38.3Very good - What previous guests thought, 1,275 reviewsVery good 1,275 reviewsPrice from£118.311 night, 2 adultsCheck availabilitySee all 552 hotels in PortlandHotels with airport shuttles in PortlandSee allComfort Suites Portland AirportHotel in PortlandAirport shuttle (free)Scored out of 10, guest rating 8.38.3Very good -
