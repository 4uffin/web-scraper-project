MMsFromUnited StatesIt is a “feast for the eyes”, beautifully restored art deco building with tasteful but comfortable appointments.
The rooms are nice but lacking pleasant views. The bedding and linens were all quality as were toiletries. And the attentiveness of the staff was five star. Any issues we had were promptly addressed and courtesy follow up given. All staff we encountered were upbeat, pleasant and actually helpful.
We had gathered from various locales to celebrate the 100th birthday of a family member. And while the celebration was held at another location, we had numerous excellent meals at Teller’s restaurant and, the staff
always cheerfully and expertly seated and served our large party.
The only general complaint among our group was the temperature in the hotel and restaurants was unpleasantly cold.Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.49.4Wonderful - What previous guests thought, 112 reviewsWonderful 112 reviewsLocation 9.7Price from$3121 night, 2 adultsCheck availabilityOmni Oklahoma City HotelHotel in Oklahoma CityLocated in Oklahoma City, a 7-minute walk from Chesapeake Energy Arena, Omni Oklahoma City Hotel provides accommodations with an outdoor swimming pool, private parking, a fitness center and a shared...AAnaFromSouth KoreaGreat facility in OKC!

The people were so friendly and there is excellent food with an abundance of options. Our favorite places that we ate at are Neighborhood Jam (incredible!), Empire Slice, and Cattleman's. We had no trouble getting around, but we had a rental car. Parking was affordable and always available. The National Cowboy Museum was phenomenal!! I would recommend setting aside at least 3.5-4 hours or more to see and enjoy the displays. Bricktown is awesome and the water taxi was one of the best parts of our trip!

If anything, the residents were kind and genuinely welcoming. Currently we live in Texas, and if we noticed a difference, it's because in Texas people are just kind out of habit or idk southern hospitality, whatever you wanna call it. The weather felt so fresh and beautiful, it makes you wanna be out and about, there definitely stuff to do with children. Maybe not a lot of options like in Houston, though you won't die of boredom in late spring.
