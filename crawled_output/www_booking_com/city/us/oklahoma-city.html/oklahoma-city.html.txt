The people were so friendly and there is excellent food with an abundance of options. Our favorite places that we ate at are Neighborhood Jam (incredible!), Empire Slice, and Cattleman's. We had no trouble getting around, but we had a rental car. Parking was affordable and always available. The National Cowboy Museum was phenomenal!! I would recommend setting aside at least 3.5-4 hours or more to see and enjoy the displays. Bricktown is awesome and the water taxi was one of the best parts of our trip! The entire city is filled with beautiful art everywhere you look! I may just have to live there some day!Show moreDGuest review byDixUnited States8.0I am of Mexican American, despite there being mostly white...I am of Mexican American, despite there being mostly white people who people on Reddit claim are racist, no one gave us looks or treated us coldly during our trip. If anything, the residents were kind and genuinely welcoming. Currently we live in Texas, and if we noticed a difference, it's because in Texas people are just kind out of habit or idk southern hospitality, whatever you wanna call it. The weather felt so fresh and beautiful, it makes you wanna be out and about, there definitely stuff to do with children. Maybe not a lot of options like in Houston, though you won't die of boredom in late spring. Make sure to get a good hotel, I won't make that mistake again, and cheaping out.Show moreJGuest review byJaciel10.0I wanted to see the Chihuly Glass exhibit at the Museum of...I wanted to see the Chihuly Glass exhibit at the Museum of Art.
