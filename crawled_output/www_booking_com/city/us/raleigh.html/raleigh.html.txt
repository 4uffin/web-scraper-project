Yes I will definitely be returning at some point. Hotel that I was at was right near the downtown area, not far from the shops and malls so there was much convenience there.

Parking was not easy anywhere as it was N C State graduation, but at the hotel, it is misrepresented, we were charged $15 per day in advance and you had to pay every time you left the garage or you could not get out, I ended up paying another 46.00. The restaurants we visited were upscale and beautiful, food was great!!
Breakfast at the Hotel every morning was very nice and plentiful, and a great staff. I used Booking dot com. for my reservations and have yet to get a printed-out billing, had to pay upfront in advance, but the rest of our group booked right online with the Marriot and was able to get a copy of their billing.
I don't like that part, I should have received a detailed billing.Show moreAGuest review byAnonymousSee reviews by guests who stayed at hotels in RaleighSee allBest Western Plus Raleigh Crabtree Valley HotelRaleighFrom £93.74 per nightScored out of 10, guest rating 8.48.4Very good - What previous guests thought, 2,255 reviews Very good · 2,255 reviewsFunctionally very good hotel.
