Yes I will definitely be returning at some point. Hotel that I was at was right near the downtown area, not far from the shops and malls so there was much convenience there. Raleigh is the capital of the state of North Carolina, which offers lots of history and historical site. I visited the Martin Luther King Memorial grounds .

Parking was not easy anywhere as it was N C State graduation, but at the hotel, it is misrepresented, we were charged $15 per day in advance and you had to pay every time you left the garage or you could not get out, I ended up paying another 46.00. The restaurants we visited were upscale and beautiful, food was great!!
Breakfast at the Hotel every morning was very nice and plentiful, and a great staff. I used Booking dot com. for my reservations and have yet to get a printed-out billing, had to pay upfront in advance, but the rest of our group booked right online with the Marriot and was able to get a copy of their billing.
I don't like that part, I should have received a detailed billing.Show moreAGuest review byAnonymousSee reviews by guests who stayed at hotels in RaleighSee allHyatt House Raleigh/Rdu/Brier CreekRaleighFrom $180.07 per nightScored out of 10, guest rating 8.98.9Excellent - What previous guests thought, 1,197 reviews Excellent · 1,197 reviewsI love this hotel .
