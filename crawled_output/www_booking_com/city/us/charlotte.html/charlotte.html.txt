My expectations were simple: a place to sleep and somewhere to eat. This hotel has no restaurant but the Shalmar Greek restaurant is a 5 min walk along the high way. I noticed a lugguage trolly by the entrance but there was no bell staff when I checked in and as tired as I was from 7 hours flying, I had to lug my bags up to the 4th floor unassisted. The room was sizeable with a designated sitting area which would have been a great reading spot - had my stay been longer. Check in for me was actually my combined check out also. The full breakfast is complimentary but I had to leave way too early to even consider it. Sunny and Leroy were my two drivers and they put a welcoming face on the complimentary shuttle service Wingate offers.Show moreDGuest review byDonna ChristineBermuda6.0We loved Carowinds had a wonderful time.We loved Carowinds had a wonderful time.

Nice food. Customer Service could’ve been a lot earlier construction was a little distraction. Lemonade was not good at all at the front desk. Bitter cookies were always good at the Doubletree. We didn’t have tissue in our room. We had half a roll on the roller housekeeping and just double checked always make sure extra role is there but everything else was OK.

Yes, it is budget and it IS basic. However, my room was scrupulously clean, with working toilet and TV, clean linen, daily refreshed teas and coffees, and a strong working lock on the door. I felt safe and comfortable and would happily come back. The young Indian guy on the door was a bit grumpy, but it was really no biggie.
