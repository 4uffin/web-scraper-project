My expectations were simple: a place to sleep and somewhere to eat. This hotel has no restaurant but the Shalmar Greek restaurant is a 5 min walk along the high way. I noticed a lugguage trolly by the entrance but there was no bell staff when I checked in and as tired as I was from 7 hours flying, I had to lug my bags up to the 4th floor unassisted. The room was sizeable with a designated sitting area which would have been a great reading spot - had my stay been longer. Check in for me was actually my combined check out also. The full breakfast is complimentary but I had to leave way too early to even consider it. Sunny and Leroy were my two drivers and they put a welcoming face on the complimentary shuttle service Wingate offers.Show moreDGuest review byDonna ChristineBermuda6.0We loved Carowinds had a wonderful time.We loved Carowinds had a wonderful time. The art museum was very educational. There is so many places to eat. We settled on Olive Garden. We also went to Stars and Strikes, very family friendly outing. The crime in Charlotte is horrible though. A couple of cars got broken into at the hotel in which we stayed and we were right beside the outlets in a nice neighborhood, so just be aware.
