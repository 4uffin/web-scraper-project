Some former canning factories now house galleries and shops on a street renamed Cannery Row after a novel by John Steinbeck. A museum and his former home in nearby Salinas can be visited.The fantastic Monterey Bay Aquarium houses a fascinating range of local sealife, which is so prevalent here that you can often see seals basking on craggy beaches, or sea lions roaring away under piers in Fisherman’s Wharf. Whalewatching tours also depart from here.South is the Monterey State Historic Park, site of historic buildings including Custom House and the Old Whaling Station with a path made from whalebone.

The aquarium was okay, for the price ($65 pp) I was expecting more. It's great for families with kids and there are more kid friendly areas there than other aquariums I have seen. Don't skip the drive to Big Sur, you can still go into Big Sur and the drive was beautiful and the trees are amazing. Cannery Row is very touristy, however there is a lot a historical information sprinkled throughout and makes for interesting reading.Show moreMGuest review byMeredithUnited StatesSee reviews by guests who stayed at hotels in MontereySee allBest Western Park Crest InnMontereyFrom $154.42 per nightScored out of 10, guest rating 7.87.8Good - What previous guests thought, 1,088 reviews Good · 1,088 reviewsNice quiet hotel, friendly staff and good location not too far from downtown Monterey.
