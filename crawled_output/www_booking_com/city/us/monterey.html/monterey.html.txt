The aquarium was okay, for the price ($65 pp) I was expecting more. It's great for families with kids and there are more kid friendly areas there than other aquariums I have seen. Don't skip the drive to Big Sur, you can still go into Big Sur and the drive was beautiful and the trees are amazing. Cannery Row is very touristy, however there is a lot a historical information sprinkled throughout and makes for interesting reading.Show moreMGuest review byMeredithUnited StatesSee reviews by guests who stayed at hotels in MontereySee allCasa Munras Garden Hotel & SpaMontereyFrom $254.32 per nightScored out of 10, guest rating 8.58.5Very Good - What previous guests thought, 1,704 reviews Very Good · 1,704 reviewsWe only stayed for one night as we were on a driving tour and stopped in Monterey to go Whale watching.
