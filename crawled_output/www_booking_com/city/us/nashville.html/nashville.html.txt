Very quaint, very clean, not too much traffic.
Everything very walkable which is what we wanted.
Italian dinner at Luogo was wonderful, great food, great service, highly recommend.
Ventured to Broadway, went to Justin Timberlake's 1230 Social Club, very cool vibe there.
Listened to local music folks, reasonably priced tapas and drinks, a much calmer atmosphere than most of the honky tonk places.Show moreFGuest review byFrankUnited States10.0In the past 4-5 years the popularity has grown exponentially...In the past 4-5 years the popularity has grown exponentially in this town. It's sooo crowded now, so many people here for 21st birthdays, bachelorette parties, anniversaries, etc. I'd say there's probably at least a 65/35 ratio of women to men here visiting. Gone are the days of tipping an artist or band 2 or 3 bucks to make a request -- it's a minimum of $20 to get your song considered an more if you want to be sure and have it move higher up in the setlist! BUT if you love live music (more classic rock than country now here) this is the place to be. Most places charge $9 for a beer, 11 for hard seltzer, 14-18 for mixed drinks. BUT there's never a cover charge and never a shortage of entertainment. You won't be disappointed.Show moreJGuest review byJamesUnited States10.0A wonderful town with lots to do and a TON of things to do...A wonderful town with lots to do and a TON of things to do if you've got a car (or want to book a trip on a tour bus).
