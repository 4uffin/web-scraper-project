Fab!Show moreLGuest review byLouiseUnited States6.0Denver has a beautiful, lively, and well-maintained downtown...Denver has a beautiful, lively, and well-maintained downtown. However, some areas of the city need much more attention. I stayed in the RiNo district and, as someone who enjoys walking, I explored several nearby streets. Many times, I was disappointed with the overall cleanliness—some places felt neglected or even abandoned. The cross-bridges over the railroad were particularly unclean. Like many other U.S. cities, there were numerous homeless individuals, many appearing to struggle with drug addiction, which made the area feel less safe. Coming from Canada, I’m used to cleaner and safer streets.
That said, there were some great highlights during my stay. I visited the Denver Art Museum, a true gem in downtown. I had planned to spend two hours there but ended up staying for over four, only leaving because of other plans I had for the day. I also attended a conference at Mission Ballroom, an impressive venue capable of hosting 2,000 to 3,000 people, with a massive stage and excellent audio and video amenities. Later, I joined a party at Number Thirty Eight, a spacious venue with great beer and drinks, easily accommodating around 700 guests.
Overall, Denver offers a mix of vibrant attractions and friendly, welcoming people, but it could benefit from improved cleanliness and safety in certain areas.Show moreYGuest review byYaghoobiCanada6.0Not that much to do in Denver itself, and the scenery around...Not that much to do in Denver itself, and the scenery around the city was disappointing, especially when compared to where I live.
Restaurants were not that interesting and there was little variety.
Thrift stores were the highlight of my visit, and there were a lot of trendy thrift clothing stores, although they were primarily for youngish women.
Cultural diversity was lacking.Show moreLGuest review byLarsLAUnited States4.0Denver features some truly stunning architecture and iconic...Denver features some truly stunning architecture and iconic buildings, but the city also shows signs of neglect and underinvestment in certain areas. Homelessness is visibly a significant issue, with many people sleeping rough in parks, sidewalks, and benches. There also appears to be a related drug problem, with occasional loud outbursts and disturbances in public spaces.
The main shopping area, 16th Street Mall, was somewhat disappointing to me - it felt dominated by tacky gift shops and entrances guarded by security, which may reflect the challenges posed by homelessness and related concerns.
On a more positive note, McGregor Square is vibrant and sports-oriented, with numerous bars and restaurants. It’s just a short walk from the magnificent Coors Field and comes highly recommended for anyone visiting.
Art lovers should not miss the Denver Art Museum. It’s a stunning building with extensive collections, and I’d suggest setting aside at least half a day to fully appreciate it.
dditionally, both the Denver Zoo and the Colorado State Capitol Building are well worth a visit. The zoo offers a great family-friendly experience, while the Capitol impresses with its beautiful architecture and panoramic city views.Show moreDGuest review byDrewUnited Kingdom2.0Denver is disgusting.Denver is disgusting.
