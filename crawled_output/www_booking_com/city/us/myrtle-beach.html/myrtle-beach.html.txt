the parking routine was not very friendly for the guests.
Need automated or allow the guest to pre-register the vehicle before they arrive.
Need to simplify the process.
Also, as a person that does not have pets, it is not very attractive watching people walk their dogs on the property to do their business.
Can the property find a place for the animals to walk, not in view of the guests from their rooms or around the pools?Show morePGuest review byPeggyUnited States10.0Every morning we walked to get coffee at the grand strand...Every morning we walked to get coffee at the grand strand cafe!
