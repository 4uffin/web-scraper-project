My birthday was coming up we decided to visit Amarillo. Our trip was a success we met a lot of really nice people. We visited,The Palo Duro Canyon, Cadillac Ranch, and shopped. The My Place hotel made this trip a top spot and a great experience😄😄. Everywhere we traveled was on I-40 with a good selection of stores and restaurants located on each side of the freeway.Show moreRGuest review byRUBYUnited States6.0I would return to Amarillo just to eat at Little Laos,...I would return to Amarillo just to eat at Little Laos, that’s how incredible it is. The staff is warm and welcoming, and the food is hands down the most delicious Thai cuisine I’ve ever had, and that’s saying a lot, considering we’ve tried Thai restaurants in several major cities. Little Laos truly takes the crown. 👑
If you’re passing through Amarillo, don’t miss it! You must try the fried quail, it’s absolutely heavenly and a hit with little ones too. The Angel Wing lives up to its name, it’s truly a gift from heaven.
For your main course, if you enjoy a little heat, I highly recommend the Pad Kra Pao with a fried egg, it’s bursting with flavor. And to top it all off, my favorite dessert in the entire universe: Little Laos’ mango sticky rice. It’s a must.Show moreLGuest review byLuisUnited States10.0Pleasantly surprised to find area restaurants with true...Pleasantly surprised to find area restaurants with true gluten free options.

The only drawback, was that it's not easy to find Lone Star beer in local restaurants.Show moreDGuest review byDonnaUnited States6.0I loved going to Palo Duro Canyon while in Amarillo.I loved going to Palo Duro Canyon while in Amarillo. It's really beautiful to drive through, but would require a lot of prep if you're hiking due to the TX heat. Cadillac Ranch isn't really worth visiting. I can't say much about the city itself though, as I've never really gone into town to try any restaurants or see anything non-touristy. I've only just passed through on my way to other places.Show moreAGuest review byAllisonUnited States10.0Dianan,desk clerk was very helpful she gave me a late check...Dianan,desk clerk was very helpful she gave me a late check out.NO EVERY THING
