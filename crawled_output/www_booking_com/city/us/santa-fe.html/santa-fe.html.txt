I used to live here and chose to visit places I once worked at. Canyon Road art walk is the best. Be sure to check the weather before packing - it can vary drastically depending on time of year. If walking is your thing, consider checking out the Dale Ball trails. Lots of trail options from beginner to advanced. But be sure you're acclimated to the elevation before you head out. If the Opera or historical museums is your vibe, there are lots of cultural activities.Show moreGGuest review byGilbertUnited States4.0THE CENTER OLD SECTION WAS CHARMING, PARKING VERY DIFFICULT.THE CENTER OLD SECTION WAS CHARMING, PARKING VERY DIFFICULT.
