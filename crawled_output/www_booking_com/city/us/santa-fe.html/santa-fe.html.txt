All rooms feature a kiva fireplace and free WiFi. Santa Fe Plaza is 591 feet from the property. CChristineFromCanadaThe Inn of the Anasazi has an embracing welcome to guests in the heart of Santa Fe. Tucked in among museums, galleries and steps from the plaza where local artists shine, this hotel is a gem. We loved the walk ability to everything, and once inside, we loved the comfort and charm of the hotel. Our room was cozy, had everything we needed. The bedding was warm and soft, water, coffee and team provided, and turn down service included a bed time story and a cookie. The main floor included a place for morning coffee and pastry, and during a busy day was a fun place to play a board game or sit with a book. The hotel is also filled with beautiful artwork and local design elements. All of these amenities elevated our experience. Finally, the employees here were mindful of our needs, so kind and warm, and happy to help with a smile every time.Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.49.4Wonderful - What previous guests thought, 114 reviewsWonderful 114 reviewsPrice from$4401 night, 2 adultsCheck availabilityDrury Plaza Hotel in Santa FeHotel in Santa FeFeaturing a seasonal outdoor pool and free hot food and cold drinks, this hotel is in Santa Fe.

This 3-star hotel offers a shared lounge and a 24-hour front desk. SStevenFromAustraliaThe location of Coyote South was ideal for me. I was roadtripping, so I knew I'd want to be close to a road artery to continue on my trip. It was also a short drive from the accommodation to the centre of Santa Fe itself, so the uber ride didn't sting the wallet. The room was comfortable, clean, and warm - necessary as I was there at the arse-end of winter, so the nights were quite chilly. The bed was definitely a highlight! The breakfast was excellent. Up to this point in my roadtrip from LA to Santa Fe, this was easily the tastiest and most nutritional food offered by the accommodation I stayed at. The burritos were great! The staff were very helpful and kind - they happily helped me with my enquiries and, when I needed to stay an extra night due to bad weather, they were extremely proficient at sorting out another room despite the short notice.Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 8.08.0Very Good - What previous guests thought, 1,248 reviewsVery Good 1,248 reviewsPrice from$59.501 night, 2 adultsCheck availabilityBest Western Plus Inn of Santa FeHotel in Santa FeLocated a 15 minute drive from Santa Fe County Municipal Airport, this hotel features an indoor heated pool and hot tub.

It’s not nearly as big as I expected from a state capital! Very manageable for a short trip. Most shops lean touristy (so many jewelry stores) but in the plaza you can find local artisans selling.

I used to live here and chose to visit places I once worked at. Canyon Road art walk is the best. Be sure to check the weather before packing - it can vary drastically depending on time of year. If walking is your thing, consider checking out the Dale Ball trails. Lots of trail options from beginner to advanced. But be sure you're acclimated to the elevation before you head out. If the Opera or historical museums is your vibe, there are lots of cultural activities.Show moreGGuest review byGilbertUnited StatesSee reviews by guests who stayed at hotels in Santa FeSee allLas PalomasSanta FeFrom $354.79 per nightScored out of 10, guest rating 8.78.7Excellent - What previous guests thought, 2,336 reviews Excellent · 2,336 reviewsThe property is well located.
