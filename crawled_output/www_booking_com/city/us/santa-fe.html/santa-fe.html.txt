This 3-star hotel offers a shared lounge and a 24-hour front desk. SStevenFromAustraliaThe location of Coyote South was ideal for me. I was roadtripping, so I knew I'd want to be close to a road artery to continue on my trip. It was also a short drive from the accommodation to the centre of Santa Fe itself, so the uber ride didn't sting the wallet. The room was comfortable, clean, and warm - necessary as I was there at the arse-end of winter, so the nights were quite chilly. The bed was definitely a highlight! The breakfast was excellent. Up to this point in my roadtrip from LA to Santa Fe, this was easily the tastiest and most nutritional food offered by the accommodation I stayed at. The burritos were great! The staff were very helpful and kind - they happily helped me with my enquiries and, when I needed to stay an extra night due to bad weather, they were extremely proficient at sorting out another room despite the short notice.Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 8.08.0Very Good - What previous guests thought, 1,249 reviewsVery Good 1,249 reviewsPrice from$59.501 night, 2 adultsCheck availabilityEl Sendero Inn, an Ascend Collection HotelHotel in Santa FeLocated on the Old Santa Fe Trail in the Historic District of Santa Fe, New Mexico, this hotel offers an outdoor pool, an on-site restaurant, and free in-room Wi-Fi.

It’s not nearly as big as I expected from a state capital! Very manageable for a short trip. Most shops lean touristy (so many jewelry stores) but in the plaza you can find local artisans selling.

I used to live here and chose to visit places I once worked at. Canyon Road art walk is the best. Be sure to check the weather before packing - it can vary drastically depending on time of year. If walking is your thing, consider checking out the Dale Ball trails. Lots of trail options from beginner to advanced. But be sure you're acclimated to the elevation before you head out.
