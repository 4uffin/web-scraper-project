The name of the city translates to City of Brotherly Love and the city itself is a vibrant mix of history, art and culture.Philly is famed for its public art with more sculptures and murals than any other city in the USA.

Visit the world’s largest urban landscaped park, Fairmount Park, with over 17 square miles of green area. There are plenty of paths and hiking trails and after that, enjoy a local cheesesteak sandwich, soft pretzel or some Tastykake snacks.Arriving at Philadelphia International Airport, you’re just a 20-minute ride from downtown. Booking.com has a variety of hotels in downtown Philly, near the airport or for the sports enthusiasts, near the Wells Fargo Center.Learn more about visiting Philadelphia192 attractions66 points of interest14 neighborhoodsFind out moreWhat Guests Said About Philadelphia:2.0Philadelphia is great.

Towers for finance, highly respected universities and institutions, but at street level everyone shares the city, which can be pretty funky--in a good way. Sad that SEPTA is experiencing closures due to lack of funding. More cars in the city center could ruin the great pedestrian atmosphere.Show moreRGuest review byRobertSpain8.0I was born and raised in Philly so I can't talk bad about it...I was born and raised in Philly so I can't talk bad about it. We are a big city with a small town feel because each section of the city has their own flavor and experiences.
Being a city with five or more colleges residing, winning sports teams , Go Birds, museums for the birth place of our country as well as the famous Rocky Steps, and after that you should be hungry so please help yourself to well known Philly cheesesteak, in beef, chicken or vegan, water ice, and you have to have a pretzel.
Summer in Philly is where we shine especially with the celebration of the 4th.

There is a tourist bus, the Philly Phlash which is very cheap (free for kids and seniors), that visits most of the key tourist spots. Otherwise getting around by the normal bus or subway is easy and inexpensive.
Food and drink is not too expensive but the additional 20% tip that seems to be expected, is something to bear in mind.
