The name of the city translates to City of Brotherly Love and the city itself is a vibrant mix of history, art and culture.Philly, as it is commonly called, is famous for its public art with more sculptures and murals than any other city in USA. Seeing the best graffiti and statutes won’t break the bank balance as you can join many free tours and admire them absolutely free of charge!It’s also home to many national historical sites with the Independence National History Park as a starting point and centre for all the major landmarks, including the Independence Hall, where the Declaration of Independence was signed and the Liberty Bell is located, the symbol of the American Revolution. Visit the world’s largest urban landscaped park, the Fairmount Park with over 37 km² of green area. There are plenty of paths and hiking trails and after that, enjoy some local specialities: a cheesesteak sandwich, a soft pretzel or some Tastykake snacks.Arriving at Philadelphia International Airport, you’re only a 20-minute ride from the city centre.

Towers for finance, highly respected universities and institutions, but at street level everyone shares the city, which can be pretty funky--in a good way. Sad that SEPTA is experiencing closures due to lack of funding. More cars in the city center could ruin the great pedestrian atmosphere.Show moreRGuest review byRobertSpain8.0I was born and raised in Philly so I can't talk bad about it...I was born and raised in Philly so I can't talk bad about it. We are a big city with a small town feel because each section of the city has their own flavor and experiences.
Being a city with five or more colleges residing, winning sports teams , Go Birds, museums for the birth place of our country as well as the famous Rocky Steps, and after that you should be hungry so please help yourself to well known Philly cheesesteak, in beef, chicken or vegan, water ice, and you have to have a pretzel.
Summer in Philly is where we shine especially with the celebration of the 4th.
So come visit Philly so we can bestow some Brotherly Love and sisterly affection, just a word of caution, never talk bad about our sports teams,lol.Show moreRGuest review byReinnaUnited States8.0The old town area is easy to walk around and contains many...The old town area is easy to walk around and contains many of the tourist locations. There is a tourist bus, the Philly Phlash which is very cheap (free for kids and seniors), that visits most of the key tourist spots. Otherwise getting around by the normal bus or subway is easy and inexpensive.
Food and drink is not too expensive but the additional 20% tip that seems to be expected, is something to bear in mind.
