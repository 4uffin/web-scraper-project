There is a nice street alongside the airport that I love, I walked it in the morning to get downtown. The staff were so friendly and amazing, there was a nice fellow at the bar who was great with small talk when serving the complimentary drinks. The breakfast was out of this world !! My room was a king suite, it was clean and fresh, the staff was available incase I needed anything at all like more cups and they respected my "do not disturb" sign in the mornings. Ultimately, I had THE best time. I will be staying there again.Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.09.0Wonderful - What previous guests thought, 394 reviewsWonderful 394 reviewsPrice from$157.061 night, 2 adultsCheck availabilitySee all 1185 hotels in PhoenixHotels with parking in PhoenixSee allHome2 Suites By Hilton Phoenix Airport SouthHotel in South Mountain, PhoenixFree parkingScored out of 10, guest rating 8.68.6Excellent - What previous guests thought, 244 reviews ExcellentÂ Â·Â 244 reviewsFrom $198.25 per nightHampton Inn & Suites Phoenix North/Happy ValleyHotel in Deer Valley, PhoenixFree parkingScored out of 10, guest rating 9.19.1Wonderful - What previous guests thought, 299 reviews WonderfulÂ Â·Â 299 reviewsFrom $143.83 per nightDrury Inn & Suites Phoenix Happy ValleyHotel in Deer Valley, PhoenixFree parkingScored out of 10, guest rating 9.39.3Wonderful - What previous guests thought, 652 reviews WonderfulÂ Â·Â 652 reviewsFrom $144.72 per nightLa Quinta by Wyndham Phoenix ChandlerHotel in Ahwatukee Foothills, PhoenixFree parkingScored out of 10, guest rating 8.08.0Very Good - What previous guests thought, 2,410 reviews Very GoodÂ Â·Â 2,410 reviewsFrom $137.38 per nightFairfield Inn & Suites by Marriott Phoenix West/TollesonHotel in PhoenixFree parkingScored out of 10, guest rating 9.09.0Wonderful - What previous guests thought, 556 reviews WonderfulÂ Â·Â 556 reviewsFrom $166.54 per nightEmbassy Suites by Hilton Phoenix Downtown NorthHotel in Encanto, PhoenixParking garageScored out of 10, guest rating 9.09.0Wonderful - What previous guests thought, 394 reviews WonderfulÂ Â·Â 394 reviewsFrom $342.24 per nightThe Global AmbassadorHotel in Camelback East, PhoenixParking on siteScored out of 10, guest rating 9.29.2Wonderful - What previous guests thought, 19 reviews WonderfulÂ Â·Â 19 reviewsFrom $1,108.09 per nightHyatt Place Phoenix/DowntownHotel in Downtown Phoenix, PhoenixParking on siteScored out of 10, guest rating 8.38.3Very Good - What previous guests thought, 1,364 reviews Very GoodÂ Â·Â 1,364 reviewsCambria Downtown Phoenix Convention & Airport HotelHotel in Downtown Phoenix, PhoenixStreet parkingScored out of 10, guest rating 8.78.7Excellent - What previous guests thought, 739 reviews ExcellentÂ Â·Â 739 reviewsFrom $269.58 per nightHome2 Suites By Hilton Phoenix MidtownHotel in Encanto, PhoenixParking on siteScored out of 10, guest rating 9.09.0Wonderful - What previous guests thought, 32 reviews WonderfulÂ Â·Â 32 reviewsFrom $249.69 per nightMost booked hotels in Phoenix and surrounding area in the past monthSee allHyatt Place Phoenix/DowntownHotel in Downtown Phoenix, PhoenixPopular with guests booking hotels in PhoenixScored out of 10, guest rating 8.38.3Very Good - What previous guests thought, 1,364 reviews Very GoodÂ Â·Â 1,364 reviewsDoubleTree Suites by Hilton PhoenixHotel in Camelback East, PhoenixPopular with guests booking hotels in PhoenixScored out of 10, guest rating 7.87.8Good - What previous guests thought, 722 reviews GoodÂ Â·Â 722 reviewsHome2 Suites By Hilton Phoenix DowntownHotel in Downtown Phoenix, PhoenixPopular with guests booking hotels in PhoenixScored out of 10, guest rating 8.88.8Excellent - What previous guests thought, 679 reviews ExcellentÂ Â·Â 679 reviewsCountry Inn & Suites by Radisson, Phoenix Airport, AZHotel in South Mountain, PhoenixPopular with guests booking hotels in PhoenixScored out of 10, guest rating 7.77.7Good - What previous guests thought, 1,046 reviews GoodÂ Â·Â 1,046 reviewsHoliday Inn Express & Suites - Phoenix - Airport North by IHGHotel in Camelback East, PhoenixPopular with guests booking hotels in PhoenixScored out of 10, guest rating 9.09.0Wonderful - What previous guests thought, 1,554 reviews WonderfulÂ Â·Â 1,554 reviewsGreenTree Inn & Suites Phoenix Sky HarborHotel in South Mountain, PhoenixPopular with guests booking hotels in PhoenixScored out of 10, guest rating 7.37.3Good - What previous guests thought, 2,194 reviews GoodÂ Â·Â 2,194 reviewsTravelodge by Wyndham Phoenix NorthHotel in Deer Valley, PhoenixPopular with guests booking hotels in PhoenixMotel 6-Phoenix, AZ - WestHotel in PhoenixPopular with guests booking hotels in PhoenixLa Quinta by Wyndham Phoenix ChandlerHotel in Ahwatukee Foothills, PhoenixPopular with guests booking hotels in PhoenixScored out of 10, guest rating 8.08.0Very Good - What previous guests thought, 2,410 reviews Very GoodÂ Â·Â 2,410 reviewsSureStay Hotel by Best Western Phoenix AirportHotel in Downtown Phoenix, PhoenixPopular with guests booking hotels in PhoenixScored out of 10, guest rating 8.38.3Very Good - What previous guests thought, 1,061 reviews Very GoodÂ Â·Â 1,061 reviewsBudget hotels in Phoenix and nearbySee allCity Center DowntownHotel in Downtown Phoenix, PhoenixCheap hotelScored out of 10, guest rating 4.74.7Disappointing - What previous guests thought, 76 reviews DisappointingÂ Â·Â 76 reviewsThis Arizona hotel is one mile from the Talking Stick Resort Arena, home to the Phenix Suns basketball team.
