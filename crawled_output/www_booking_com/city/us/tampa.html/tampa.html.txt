We usually go out of Port Canaveral. The hotel we stayed at was good for the price and located close to what you need, but away from the water. The only caution I would say was we witnessed a 4 car accident on the highway due to a driver who was either distracted or driving too fast. They ended up flipping their car after hitting two other which caused those cars to hit others. Be careful and alert when driving, but overall a good place to visit, even if just staying the night before a cruise.Show moreBGuest review byBrittanyTUnited States10.0Although I was born in Tampa, I no longer live there.Although I was born in Tampa, I no longer live there.
