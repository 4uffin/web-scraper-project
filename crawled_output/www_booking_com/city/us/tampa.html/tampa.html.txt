SSophersFromCayman IslandsThe front desk staff were amazing and accommodating, they went above and beyond to help me return a package that arrived too late for me. The bar staff made amazing cocktails and were able to advise us on other inside knowledge of where they have experienced a nice steak house or alternative eateries but obv the bar area was just as excellent,
The decor was amazing, the corridors are massive by the rooms which is probably why the rooms are also quiet.
So many other nice restaurants nearby with fabulous vibes, some decent shops, clean streets, a cinema, cake shops, sweet shops, Sephora, Lulu Lemon, Nike etc.
The rooms had microwave, really good hairdryer, clothes steamer, Nespresso machine, mini fridge, breakfast table. It was a fabulous space enough to swing many cats around the room.
We had such an amazing time, taxi to airport was only maybe 12 minutes away. I want to personally thank JENNA, ELLA, SKYLER and NICOLE for making such a big difference to our stay.Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.09.0Superb - What previous guests thought, 121 reviewsSuperb 121 reviewsPrice from£308.541 night, 2 adultsCheck availabilityHyatt House Tampa Airport/WestshoreHotel in Westshore, TampaLocated in Tampa, 4.4 km from Raymond James Stadium, Hyatt House Tampa Airport/Westshore provides accommodation with a fitness centre, private parking and a bar.

We usually go out of Port Canaveral. The hotel we stayed at was good for the price and located close to what you need, but away from the water. The only caution I would say was we witnessed a 4 car accident on the highway due to a driver who was either distracted or driving too fast. They ended up flipping their car after hitting two other which caused those cars to hit others. Be careful and alert when driving, but overall a good place to visit, even if just staying the night before a cruise.Show moreBGuest review byBrittanyTUnited States10.0Although I was born in Tampa, I no longer live there.Although I was born in Tampa, I no longer live there.

We made a couple of attempts to explore the wider city but were surprised by the lack of shopping opportunities – even our tour boat operator highlighted this by pointing out where a new mall is under construction.
You can see that parts of the city are quite run down, but it's also evident that there are efforts underway to improve and regenerate these areas, likely due to its growing popularity.
For us, a week felt like the perfect amount of time to spend in Tampa. Any longer, and we feel you'd need to venture further afield for activities, especially if you're not someone who can spend multiple days relaxing on a beach.Show moreLGuest review byLewisUnited KingdomSee reviews by guests who stayed at hotels in TampaSee allLe Meridien Tampa, The CourthouseTampaFrom £451.70 per nightScored out of 10, guest rating 8.68.6Fabulous - What previous guests thought, 103 reviews Fabulous · 103 reviewsGreat Staff, Latisha, Kennie, Ember were all great, so helpful, and the valet service team was great!
