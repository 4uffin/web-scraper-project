We usually go out of Port Canaveral. The hotel we stayed at was good for the price and located close to what you need, but away from the water. The only caution I would say was we witnessed a 4 car accident on the highway due to a driver who was either distracted or driving too fast. They ended up flipping their car after hitting two other which caused those cars to hit others. Be careful and alert when driving, but overall a good place to visit, even if just staying the night before a cruise.Show moreBGuest review byBrittanyTUnited States10.0Although I was born in Tampa, I no longer live there.Although I was born in Tampa, I no longer live there.

We made a couple of attempts to explore the wider city but were surprised by the lack of shopping opportunities – even our tour boat operator highlighted this by pointing out where a new mall is under construction.
You can see that parts of the city are quite run down, but it's also evident that there are efforts underway to improve and regenerate these areas, likely due to its growing popularity.
For us, a week felt like the perfect amount of time to spend in Tampa. Any longer, and we feel you'd need to venture further afield for activities, especially if you're not someone who can spend multiple days relaxing on a beach.Show moreLGuest review byLewisUnited KingdomSee reviews by guests who stayed at hotels in TampaSee allThe Westin Tampa WatersideTampaScored out of 10, guest rating 7.87.8Good - What previous guests thought, 195 reviews Good · 195 reviewsLocation was very good, close to Downtown Tampa but within easy access of a 'Riverwalk'.
