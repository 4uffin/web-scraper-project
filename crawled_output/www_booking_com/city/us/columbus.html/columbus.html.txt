Many of those years have been held at the state fairgrounds and still is today.
Being from New England it didn't take me long to figure out that the people from around here are great!
Everyone I have met here has turned into long-term friends and business acquaintances.
I've said numerous times that if I had to live out here I could.
Downtown offers many great places to visit with plenty of restaurants and easy parking.
The surrounding communities are great too and have easy access with the beltway highway system.
Thanks Columbus for being a great place!Show moreDGuest review byDavidUnited States10.0What I liked most was my first impressionWhat I liked most was my first impression
when I walked in the door ; clean , well outlite, comfortable lobby with a fireplace and chairs to relax. It felt homey and warm Especially since it was Christmas Eve and 20 Degrees outside! The smell of fresh brewed coffee and hot chocolate available for the kids. It was a great prelude to our stay !
What I did share in my other review is the only downfall Was no security in the parking lot since there has been a radh of break-ins in peoples cars in extended-stay properties. Again investing in security in your parking lot would be a way of conveying to your guest that their safety and their belongings are important to your company! Merry Christmas and happy new year!Show moreTGuest review byThomasSee reviews by guests who stayed at hotels in ColumbusSee allAC Hotel by Marriott Columbus DowntownColumbusFrom £419.21 per nightScored out of 10, guest rating 8.68.6Fabulous - What previous guests thought, 106 reviews Fabulous · 106 reviewsIt was very clean - which is my number one make or break with hotels.
