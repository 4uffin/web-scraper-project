We visited German Village and a mall when we were there. We came for the weekend for a concert but it was canceled. It has many places to visit and see. The worst thing is the traffic! Roads downtown now need to be bypassed and added to due to all the people. Waiting in traffic downtown was terrible. The only thing that did make it tolerable was that people were polite about letting you over when you needed to switch lanes which helped immensely! I wouldn't want to drive their everyday. I went to OSU in 1977 and the traffic was nothing like it is now. It is best to try and go around the city and then cut into where you are going at some point. Love Columbus but they need to build some new highways!Show morePGuest review byPamela10.0Columbus is my second home (I live in Pittsburgh, PA) Any...Columbus is my second home (I live in Pittsburgh, PA) Any chance I get to visit the city I love it.

Many of those years have been held at the state fairgrounds and still is today.
Being from New England it didn't take me long to figure out that the people from around here are great!
Everyone I have met here has turned into long-term friends and business acquaintances.
I've said numerous times that if I had to live out here I could.
Downtown offers many great places to visit with plenty of restaurants and easy parking.
The surrounding communities are great too and have easy access with the beltway highway system.
Thanks Columbus for being a great place!Show moreDGuest review byDavidUnited StatesSee reviews by guests who stayed at hotels in ColumbusSee allResidence Inn by Marriott Columbus AirportColumbusFrom $179.36 per nightScored out of 10, guest rating 9.09.0Wonderful - What previous guests thought, 175 reviews Wonderful · 175 reviewsThe breakfast was amazing, with a variety of choices to pick from.
