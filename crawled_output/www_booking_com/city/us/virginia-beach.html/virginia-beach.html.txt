We had a long wait between trolleys, and when the trolley finally arrived, the driver had to sit for 10 minutes and explain to each passenger the fare system. Payment for the trolley is not clearly stated-the driver has to explain how the trolley works and how much it costs to EVERY person who boards the trolley. Really, the trolley company should have handouts at each hotel and shop and restaurant in the area, and people should be able to purchase tickets at hotels and shops. That would cut down on wait times, and help move the trolleys along.
Virginia Beach has a lot of nice restaurants and cute boutiques, not to mention a souvenir shop on almost every corner.
