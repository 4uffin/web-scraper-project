The city is huge if you include Brooklyn and the other suburbs so if you wanted to do everything you'd need at least a week. The city is constantly humming and is generally really busy so it has a good vibe but can be a bit much if you're not used to that sort of thing. You will also end up doing a lot of walking. Overall, the history of the place is amazing and there is so much to do and see and loads of amazing places to eat and drink so there's something for everyone.Show moreGGuest review byGregScottUnited KingdomSee reviews by guests who stayed at hotels in New YorkSee allFreehand New YorkGramercy, New YorkFrom £399.28 per nightScored out of 10, guest rating 8.08.0Very good - What previous guests thought, 2,418 reviews Very good · 2,418 reviewsLoved the old New York style and large room with the huge bathroom.
