DDaadFromNetherlandsI had a lovely stay at this charming hotel, Although the design is older, it has a unique character and warmth that I really appreciated. The decor features beautiful touches of copper, marble, and wood which gave it a stylish yet cozy feel. Was clena and comfortable. The staff were kind and helpful - they even gave us a voucher for breakfast on the first day which was thoughtful. The breakfast itself wasn't huge but it had everything you'd want to start the day right.

The city is constantly humming and is generally really busy so it has a good vibe but can be a bit much if you're not used to that sort of thing. You will also end up doing a lot of walking.

The energy is unmatched – from the chaos of Times Square to the unexpected calm of Central Park. I visited iconic landmarks like the Empire State Building, the Brooklyn Bridge, and the Statue of Liberty, but also wandered through character-filled neighborhoods like SoHo,Little Italy, China Town...
The food was a highlight – classic New York pizza, fresh bagels, and an incredible variety of international cuisine. Public transportation was surprisingly efficient, though it can be a bit overwhelming at first.
In just a few days, New York managed to amaze us. It's a city that never sleeps and never stops surprising you.
