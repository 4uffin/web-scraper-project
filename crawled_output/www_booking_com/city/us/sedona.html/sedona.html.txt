So glad we finally decided to visit.
It is a beautiful area. We went in “off season” - summer. We are used to hot temperatures so the heat was really not a problem for us. Bonus, in off season it is really easy to get around the area in a car. I spoke to a Sedona resident who said in peak season it can take her over an hour just to drive her son to school. Uptown has so many shops to visit. We also enjoyed local restaurants and saw very few big national chain restaurants. One of our favorites was the ChocolaTree. All organic, fresh and unique dishes.Show moreMGuest review byMarkUnited States10.0We did it all, A holiday weekend may have not been the right...We did it all, A holiday weekend may have not been the right timing ..

Loved being up high, like Airport Mesa lookout and Chapel of Holy Cross, for a wide-angel view of the city.
The town is full of resorts that make your stay relaxing and convenient.
Plenty of stores, shops and a great visitors center to complete your stay.
Situated in the Verde Valley, the area offers a variety of charming towns nearby like Cottonwood, Clarkdale, Jerome and Camp Verde.
The downtown can get quite busy during the weekends and tourist season but it's best to park the car and just walk.Show moreRGuest review byRosemarieUnited States10.0I like everything from customer service, when we check in...I like everything from customer service, when we check in late, the lady is super helpful.
