WWalstonFromUnited StatesDinner on the patio on our first night was magical, with ever-changing views of the clouds and hills as the sun set behind us.
Our waiter, Matt, was a pure delight (as were all others during our stay).
The food was spectacular.
From the property, we set out on three hikes and one guided bike ride (shout out to George - he was amazing and a great coach!).
Do not miss the gorgeous hike out to Devil's Bridge (the trailhead is a short drive away)!
Start early - so peaceful.
A bit challenging at the end, but so worth it!
We also enjoyed the Trail House and talking to the knowledgeable staff.Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 9.29.2Superb - What previous guests thought, 234 reviewsSuperb 234 reviewsLocation 9.8Price from£567.021 night, 2 adultsCheck availabilityAdobe Grand VillasHotel in West, SedonaFeaturing a seasonal pool, this Sedona, Arizona hotel features elegant adobe inspired rooms.
