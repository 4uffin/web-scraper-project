Rooms feature free Wi-Fi and cable TV. XXin-CiFromSingaporeThis was an excellent hotel, with helpful staff, beautiful grounds and large, well-stocked and thoughtfully designed rooms. I'd recommend requesting the ground-floor rooms that open into the garden. It was cool to wake up to the scent of flowers and chirping of birds in front of the red rocks. There were hummingbirds visiting the feeders hung in the garden which was a real treat for us, having never seen hummingbirds in real life before!
Room itself was large and had good storage; we especially liked the convenience of the sink area being separated from the shower/WC. Very useful when multiple people are staying together. Appreciated the generous amounts of toiletries, especially the big bottle of body lotion: a huge help in the dry climate. The fridge was also big compared to those in other hotels, which was much needed to cool all our drinks for long hikes.
You can walk right from the property up to Sunset Vista, which has red deck chairs and offers great 360 degree views of the rocks and is beautiful at sunset. Brett, the concierge, gave an interesting free talk on the history of Sedona and its wildlife/geographic features, and he also provided us with a helpful guide to hikes based on difficulty. I recommend having a chat with him first on where you'd like to go as he's a seasoned hiker. The hotel also has other free activities from meditation to stargazing (which we unfortunately missed because it's on Sundays). The property is also conveniently near Marg’s Draw Trailhead, a K-Mart and nice restaurants (Mole, The Hudson)
Also a shout out to Geoff, who answered my questions on Pink Jeep tours online even before we arrived. The hotel can help you book these or otherwise provide useful info. Overall, the staff were helpful and friendly, from the housekeepers to the reception staff. There was also a live performance each night by a local singer, and you could sit by the chairs with firepits.
