except the one that done our check-in.
He didn't attempt to say hello, or anything.
He had a bad vibe from the moment
I got to the counter. The only time he spoke to me was when I asked my daughter on purpose out loud so he could hear me,
did she think he had an attitude. Then he tried to make a fake convo by asking did we have a good drive or flight there.Show moreScored out of 10, guest rating 8.78.7Excellent - What previous guests thought, 1,552 reviewsExcellent 1,552 reviewsLocation 9.6Price from$1591 night, 2 adultsCheck availabilityCasa Loma Panama City Beach - BeachfrontHotel in Panama City BeachCasa Loma is located in Panama City Beach and features a Gulf-front outdoor pool and free WiFi access.

St. Andrew’s State Park is a great place to visit where you can relax and pick up sea shells and maybe see an Ice Cream boat come by. The Turtle Girls is a great place for a little shopping .

Calm waters most of the time. Not a lot of shells though. Lots of fish and some other wildlife.
Pier was beautifully clean (likely due to the fact that one has to pay to visit - it's cheap).
McGuire's Irish Pub has the best Senate Soup. Fish and chips were okay (it's made with a catfish-like fish, not haddock, and is not beer battered). But the shepherd's pie and soup was amazing!
Go deep sea fishing with Jubilee Fishing! Great crew and we caught lots of fish!
