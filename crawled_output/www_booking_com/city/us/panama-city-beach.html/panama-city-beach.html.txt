Calm waters most of the time. Not a lot of shells though. Lots of fish and some other wildlife.
Pier was beautifully clean (likely due to the fact that one has to pay to visit - it's cheap).
McGuire's Irish Pub has the best Senate Soup. Fish and chips were okay (it's made with a catfish-like fish, not haddock, and is not beer battered). But the shepherd's pie and soup was amazing!
Go deep sea fishing with Jubilee Fishing! Great crew and we caught lots of fish!
