First stop was - Harpoon Harry's, - which is beside the Chateau by the beach Resort. The Seafood platter was enough for three. Next, we were off to Putt-Putt Golf, but noticed the new Golf Center. Wow, that place was great!
Strolling through the Pier Park shops, I picked up several souvenirs and some clearance summer items to take back home. I was pleasantly tired when we returned to the Chateau, so the Tikki bar was nice to sit by the pool, relax, have a cool beverage, and make dinner plans. Speaking of food, I must give a shout-out to the Waffle Houses of PCB! Brunch, to me, is the best meal of the day.Show moreKGuest review byKimUnited States10.0Great place lots to do but I would not recommend hooters...Great place lots to do but I would not recommend hooters there food was awful i wondered why parking was half empty usually that place is packed and my family has ate there a lot in past years won’t be going back there sandbar was good and sharkys was great and there’s so many more.
