The natural surrounds of the Sierra Nevada and Lake Tahoe provide winter and water sports enthusiasts with plenty of action, and its well-renowned nightlife and proximity to Stateline in Nevada satisfies the partygoers.There are a multitude of restaurants, bars and dance clubs set back from its sandy or rocky shores that are open around the clock. Jump aboard the old Mississippi paddle wheeler Tahoe Queen as she ploughs her way through the intense blue waters of the lake or you can choose for muscle power by going canoeing.Not far from North America’s largest alpine lake is Heavenly Ski Resort that features an abundance of world-class ski runs all serviced by a large number of quality ski lifts. The runs provide something for everyone from beginners to the more experienced, and snowboarders to cross-country skiers.The astonishing wilderness that surrounds South Lake Tahoe can be explored on mountain bike or by boat. Emerald Bay is particularly impressive with the magnificent Vikingsholm castle hidden amongst the pine-infested hills.Booking.com offers something for every taste whether it is a skiing resort, lakeside lodge, luxury hotel or backpacker hostel.What guests said about South Lake Tahoe:10.0Bike paths are great.Bike paths are great.
