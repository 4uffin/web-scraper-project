Located in the heart of the Nevada desert, this city is called the Entertainment Capital of the World for a reason. You can stroll down Fremont Street in old Las Vegas like a member of the Rat Pack or act like a modern high-roller at Caesar’s Palace. Prepare for a long night as the neon lights of clubs and casinos will tempt you to sink into the world of gambling and music. Las Vegas is renowned of its fine dining, great shopping and live performances of famous artists and comedians. Right from the moment you leave McCarran International Airport you can try your luck at a slot machine, but you might want to wait until you get to the Las Vegas strip and the dozens of larger than life casinos. When you’re ready for a break from the bustle of the city, visit the nearby Hoover Dam with the largest man-made lake, Lake Mead. The Paiute Indian Reservation in Vegas’ downtown area offers something a bit more spiritual. Whichever type of accommodation you choose, whether a skyscraper hotel or a design city apartment, you’ll never run out of fantastic activities in Sin City. Booking.com has the perfect place to stay for your Vegas vacation.Learn more about visiting Las Vegas983 attractions77 points of interest11 neighborhoodsFind out moreWhat Guests Said About Las Vegas:8.0Dont recommend it for children ( although if u take them,...Dont recommend it for children ( although if u take them, the Excalibur has a Traditional Childrens Gaming arcade in the basement and a childrens outdoor pool with fun toys.
But there is a lot of walking required up and down The Strip and it has a lot of beggars/ panhandlers/ drug addicts/ Bachalorette & Stag parties/ and Sex Workers all on show. Not the kind of environment for young children really.
The British get a poor currency exchange rate so the USA is expensive for Brits anyway- but Vegas is more expensive than other places in the USA too- then expect to pay a Sales Tax at the checkout- and on top of that- Everybody thinks you owe them a tip for doing their job.

Plan for $20 minimum taxi fare. The people were so friendly and lovely and we were made to feel so welcome by all. The only rude people were other tourists.
