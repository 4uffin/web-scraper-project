Located in the heart of the Nevada desert, this city is called the Entertainment Capital of the World for a reason. You can stroll down Fremont Street in old Las Vegas like a member of the Rat Pack or act like a modern high-roller at Caesar’s Palace. Prepare for a long night as the neon lights of clubs and casinos will tempt you to sink into the world of gambling and music. Las Vegas is renowned of its fine dining, great shopping and live performances of famous artists and comedians. Right from the moment you leave McCarran International Airport you can try your luck at a slot machine, but you might want to wait until you get to the Las Vegas strip and the dozens of larger than life casinos. When you’re ready for a break from the bustle of the city, visit the nearby Hoover Dam with the largest man-made lake, Lake Mead. The Paiute Indian Reservation in Vegas’ downtown area offers something a bit more spiritual. Whichever type of accommodation you choose, whether a skyscraper hotel or a design city apartment, you’ll never run out of fantastic activities in Sin City. Booking.com has the perfect place to stay for your Vegas vacation.Learn more about visiting Las Vegas981 attractions77 points of interest11 neighborhoodsFind out moreWhat Guests Said About Las Vegas:10.0I really enjoyed Las Vegas as a whole.I really enjoyed Las Vegas as a whole. The strip is exciting and has so much to offer. The food was amazing! Top chefs from around the world are here or left their influence. I'm not a buffet person but was talked into one at the Wynn Hotel, amazing (make a reservation the wait is long).
Every type of entertainment that the normal persons could ever want.
Leaving the strip you find yourself in a normal small city.

But there is a lot of walking required up and down The Strip and it has a lot of beggars/ panhandlers/ drug addicts/ Bachalorette & Stag parties/ and Sex Workers all on show. Not the kind of environment for young children really.
The British get a poor currency exchange rate so the USA is expensive for Brits anyway- but Vegas is more expensive than other places in the USA too- then expect to pay a Sales Tax at the checkout- and on top of that- Everybody thinks you owe them a tip for doing their job. So plan to spend about 30% more than u estimated in Vegas.Show moreDGuest review byDavidUnited Kingdom10.0We always enjoy the vie win Vegas.We always enjoy the vie win Vegas.

The cost of everything is astronomical and if you're planning on doing it on a budget, you will really struggle. You really need to take Uber or Taxis everywhere to see the full city. Plan for $20 minimum taxi fare. The people were so friendly and lovely and we were made to feel so welcome by all. The only rude people were other tourists. The High Roller, Zipline and Freemont Street are definitely worth the money.
