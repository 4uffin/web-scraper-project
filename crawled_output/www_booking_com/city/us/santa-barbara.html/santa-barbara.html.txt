A walk on the pier is a must.
Free 90minute parking but walk instead.
The Spanish-style architecture gives the city a unique charm.
With the mountains as a background, the ocean spreads out to the west.
This is a city to chill and stroll in.
Most of restaurants are located on State Street, which was closed off to vehicles and was more like a pedestrian Mall on Sunday night.
Not sure if it's closed for foot traffic every night.
