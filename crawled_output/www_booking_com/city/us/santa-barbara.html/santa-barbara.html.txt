A walk on the pier is a must.
Free 90minute parking but walk instead.
The Spanish-style architecture gives the city a unique charm.
With the mountains as a background, the ocean spreads out to the west.
This is a city to chill and stroll in.
Most of restaurants are located on State Street, which was closed off to vehicles and was more like a pedestrian Mall on Sunday night.
Not sure if it's closed for foot traffic every night.
Do be aware of bikes-etc. on State Street though.Show moreDGuest review byDennisUnited StatesSee reviews by guests who stayed at hotels in Santa BarbaraSee allThe Franciscan HotelWest Beach, Santa BarbaraFrom $454.86 per nightScored out of 10, guest rating 8.98.9Excellent - What previous guests thought, 1,982 reviews Excellent · 1,982 reviewsWhat an absolute gem of a hotel - perfect positioned for both the beach and for enjoying State Street, the hub of Santa Barbara.
