The data kept in your user account can help you plan and manage future trip reservations and personalized recommendations.There are other circumstances where you’ll provide us with personal data. For example, if you’re using our platform from your mobile device, you can decide to allow Booking.com to use your current location or grant us access to some other details.

They are also integrated into the services of strategic partners you can find online. When you make a reservation online using a service for which the strategic partner relies on Booking.com, we receive the reservation details via the strategic partner so that your reservation can be processed and supported.Trip providers may share information about you with Booking.com too. This could happen if you have support questions about a pending trip reservation, or if disputes or other issues arise about a trip reservation.We integrate with third-party payment service providers such as Adyen and Stripe to, for example, facilitate electronic payments between you, Booking.com, and trip providers. These service providers share payment information so we can administer and handle your trip reservation.In some cases, we link to other business partners providing trip reservations that may not be available on our website or mobile apps.

For example, we can only process a trip reservation for you with your name and contact details.We use your personal data for a number of purposes as outlined here:A.

Communicating with youThere may be times when we get in touch with you, including via email, chatbot, mail, phone call, push notification, platform notification, or text message. Which method we choose depends on the contact information you’ve previously shared.We process personal data in communications you and other parties send to us. There may be a number of reasons for this, including:Responding to and handling any support requests made by you or the trip provider you booked with. We offer travelers and trip providers various ways to exchange information via our platform, such as regarding requests and comments about trip providers and trip reservations made via Booking.com.If you’ve started but not finished a trip reservation online, we might contact you to invite you to continue with your reservation. We believe this convenience benefits you because it allows you to pick up the process where you left off without having to search for a trip provider or fill in your reservation details again.When you use our trip services, we might send you a survey or otherwise invite you to provide a review about your experience with us or the trip provider.We also send you other material related to your trip reservations, such as how to contact us if you need help while you’re away and information that we feel might be useful to prepare for your trip and get the best experience.Even if you don’t have an upcoming trip, we may still need to send you other administrative messages, which could include security alerts.In case misconduct is reported to us by a trip provider, for example, we may send you a warning or other notice.To do this, we use personal data such as your first and last name, email address, and reservation details, including reservation IDs and chosen locations.F. Market researchWe sometimes invite our customers to participate in market research. Review the information that accompanies this kind of invitation to understand what personal data will be collected and how it’s used.G. Improving our servicesWe use personal data about travelers using our platform for analytical purposes, including for analyzing how you or travelers like you with similar interests use our platform, measuring our operating performance and improving trip services. We may process your user ID, which is linked to the email address used if you created a user account, for the purpose of measuring the audience visiting our websites. Your personal data may be used by us to develop and enhance our machine learning models and artificial intelligence systems. This is a necessary part of our ongoing commitment to make our services better and enhance our travelers’ experience. For more details, see the How we use artificial intelligence and make automated decisions section.In addition to the statistics we generate regularly about our business, we use data to test and troubleshoot platform features. The main goal here is to get insights into how our services perform, how they’re used, and ultimately how to optimize and customize our website and mobile apps, making them easier and more meaningful to use. As much as possible, we strive to use anonymized and de-identified personal data for this analytical work.To achieve this, we may combine personal data we collect from you during different visits to our platform or visits on different devices, even when you aren’t logged in.To do this, we use personal data such as:Reservations made by travelers over specific periods of time or for specific productsThe searches travelers made on our websites and appsThe reviews travelers shared with us about their trip experienceOur recurring work for analytical purposes includes the use of solutions that de-identify personal data or process personal data in encrypted formats.H. Showing the pricing applicable to youWhen you search our websites or mobile apps (e.g. to find an accommodation, a rental car, or flight), the pricing you see may depend on a number of factors, such as whether you’re in the European Economic Area (EEA) or another country.To display the pricing applicable to you, we use personal data such as your IP address, the type of device you’re using, and which site you came from.I. Customer reviews and other destination-related informationDuring and after your trip, we might invite you to submit a review. We can also make it possible for the people you’re traveling with or for whom you’ve booked a reservation to do this instead. This invitation asks for information about the trip provider or the destination.If you have a Booking.com user account, you can choose to display a screen name next to your review, instead of your first name.By completing a review, you’re agreeing that it can be displayed (as described in detail in our Terms of Service), for example, on:The relevant trip provider information page on our websitesOur mobile appsOur social media accountsWebsites operated by third-party companies such as trip providers.This helps to inform other travelers about the quality of the trip service you used, the destination you chose, or any other experiences you choose to share without disclosing your identity. Reviews submitted by travelers are subject to automated and other content moderation to verify that reviews conform with our Content standards and guidelines.J. Call monitoringWhen you make calls to our customer service team, we use an automated telephone number detection system to match the number you call from to the reservation you made. This saves time for you and our customer service staff. However, our customer service staff may still ask for further identification to further ensure your reservation details remain confidential.When you call our customer service team, we may have one or more authorized persons listen to the call or record the call for training and quality control purposes. This quality control includes the usage of the recordings to handle possible complaints, legal claims, and indications of possible fraud attempts.We don’t record every call made to our customer service team. If a call is recorded, it’s kept for a limited amount of time (30 days by default). We then automatically delete the call recording unless we determine before then that it will be necessary to retain it for fraud investigation or legal purposes.K. Promotion of a safe and trustworthy service and prevention of fraudWe continuously analyze and use certain personal data to prevent and detect online fraud attempts and other illegal or unwanted activities. This is necessary to maintain our platform as a trustworthy environment as well as for the safety of all travelers.We use personal data for safety and security purposes, including when you report a safety concern, when others do so about you, or when we need to identify persons in connection with a user account or reservation. When we do this, we may have to stop or put certain reservations on hold until we’ve finished our assessment. If we have concerns about serious misconduct, we may decide to cancel your upcoming reservations or to decline future reservations via our platform.In case of safety or security concerns, we may process information from publicly available sources to prevent or detect harm. We cannot prevent that some of that information may contain special categories of personal data.In order to detect and prevent fraud and limit other abuse of our platform, we may use your personal data and analyze your behavior on our platform to assess the risk of a certain action or transaction you are attempting to make. For example, this may help us determine whether a bot is using our platform rather than a legitimate user, or to determine whether a user is making a fraudulent payment using a stolen credit card.To achieve this purpose, we use personal data such as your contact information, other identifiers (such as IP addresses), reservation details including canceled reservations, reviews, account information, browsing data, location data, communications data, or other information that you or another person has provided to us.We use artificial intelligence to review activity on our platform for fraud and to detect any other forms of misconduct as described in the section How we use artificial intelligence and make automated decisions.L. Legal purposesIn certain cases, we may need to reuse your information to:Handle and resolve legal claims and disputesAddress possible regulatory investigationsEnforce our online reservation Terms of ServiceComply with lawful requests from law enforcementComply with laws and regulations that apply to Booking.comFor example, we may be required to process your reservation history, the details of one or more of these reservations and associated payment information.Legal bases for personal data processingTo process your personal data as described above, Booking.com relies on several legal bases provided for in applicable privacy regulations. This is summarized as follows:Purpose of personal data processingLegal basis and commentsA. Trip reservationsB. Customer serviceHere Booking.com relies on the legal basis that the processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract involving you, specifically to finalize and administer your trip reservation.If the required personal data isn’t provided, Booking.com can’t finalize the trip reservation with the trip provider, nor can we provide customer service to you about it.C. User accountsD. Marketing activitiesE. Communicating with youF. Market researchG. Improving our servicesH. Showing the pricing applicable to youI. Customer reviews and other destination-related informationJ. Call monitoringK.

Before we process personal data to serve Booking.com’s or a third-party's legitimate interests, Booking.com balances your rights and interests in the protection of personal data with Booking.com’s rights and interests or those of the third party.The legitimate interests include, for example, avoiding financial harm from online fraud, sharing people’s experiences with prospective travelers, and keeping people informed about offers we think might be of interest.In the unlikely event Booking.com would process special categories of personal data in the context of purpose K, we rely, where applicable, on the fact that processing relates to personal data which are manifestly made public by the individual or other legal bases as may be assessed at the time.L. Legal purposesBooking.com also relies, where applicable, on compliance with legal obligations (e.g. lawful law enforcement requests).All purpose categoriesFinally, where needed under evolving applicable law, Booking.com will obtain your consent prior to processing your personal data, including for direct marketing purposes or where otherwise required by law.If you want to object to the processing set out under C to L and no opt-out mechanism is available to you directly (e.g. in your user account settings), contact us as described in the Your rights section.How we share personal data within Booking.comTo support the use of Booking.com services, your details may be shared within Booking.com group entities and the other Booking Holdings Inc. companies described in the section on Our company.How we share personal data within the Booking Holdings Inc. groupWe may receive personal data about you from other companies in the BHI group (e.g. Agoda or OpenTable), or share your personal data with them, for the following purposes:To provide services (including making, administering, and managing reservations or handling payments)To provide customer serviceTo detect, prevent, and investigate fraudulent or other illegal activities and data breaches, companies within BHI may need to exchange personal data about certain persons to ensure all platform users are protected, for example, from online fraud attemptsFor analytical and product improvement purposes where permitted by applicable lawTo provide personalized offers or send you marketing communications with your consent or as otherwise permitted by applicable lawFor hosting, technical support, overall maintenance, and maintaining security of such shared dataTo ensure compliance with applicable lawsAs applicable and unless indicated otherwise, for purposes A to F we rely on our legitimate interests to share and receive personal data. For purpose G, we rely, where applicable, on compliance with legal obligations (such as lawful law enforcement requests). We also ensure that data flows between companies in the BHI group comply with applicable law. Where needed under applicable law, we will obtain your consent before sharing your personal data with other companies in the BHI group.How we share personal data with third partiesIn certain circumstances, we’ll share your personal data with third parties. These third parties include:The trip provider you booked withIn order to complete your trip reservation, we need to transfer relevant reservation details to the trip provider you have chosen.Depending on the trip reservation and the trip provider, the details we share can include your name, contact and payment details, the names of the people accompanying you, and any other relevant information (e.g. check-in/check-out dates), including preferences you specified when you made your trip reservation.In certain cases, we also provide some summary information about you to the trip provider. This can include:Whether you’ve already booked with the trip provider in the pastThe number of completed reservations you’ve made with usThe absence of reports to Booking.com regarding misconduct involving youThe percentage of reservations you may have canceled in the past on our platformWhether you’ve given reviews about past reservationsIf you have a query about your trip, we may contact the trip provider to handle your request. Unless payment is made to Booking.com itself during the reservation process, we need to forward your credit card details to the trip provider you chose for payment processing.To resolve possible trip-related claims or disputes or any other kind of customer service issue, we may provide the trip provider on an as-needed basis with your contact details and other information about the reservation, claim, or dispute. This can include, for example, your email address and a copy of your reservation confirmation to confirm that the trip reservation was made or the reasons for its cancellation.Trip providers will further process your personal data outside of the control of Booking.com to prepare for arriving and departing guests, for example. Trip providers may also ask for additional personal data, for instance to provide additional services and to comply with local requirements and restrictions. If available, read the privacy statement of the trip provider to understand how they process your personal data.Strategic partnersWe work with many strategic partners around the world. These strategic partners distribute and advertise Booking.com’s services, including the services and products of our trip providers. Depending on the strategic partner, you may make your trip reservation through:our website that’s operated in partnership with a strategic partner; orstrategic partners’ websites or mobile apps.For the former, the strategic partners will receive certain personal data related to your specific reservation and your interactions on these websites. This is for their commercial purposes.For the latter, certain personal data that you give them, such as your name and email address, your address, payment details, and other relevant information, will be forwarded to us to finalize and manage your trip reservation. With these strategic partners, we may act as joint controllers for processing of specific personal data. If you choose to exercise your data subject rights with our strategic partners, we may collaborate to ensure an adequate response to your request.For fraud detection and prevention purposes, we may also exchange information about our users with strategic partners – but only when strictly necessary.Connectivity providersMany trip providers contract with specific third-party companies (often referred to as “connectivity providers”) to automate the routing of reservation information from Booking.com and other members of the travel industry to them.Connectivity providers act on behalf of trip providers (rather than Booking.com) and forward reservation information to them so they can manage their reservations in their systems.Third-party service providersWe use service providers from outside of the Booking Holdings Inc. company group to support us in providing our trip services. The services these third-party companies provide include:Customer supportIndustry/market researchFraud detection and prevention (including anti-fraud screening)Insurance coverage claims handlingPayment processingWe use third parties to electronically process payments, handle chargebacks, or provide billing collection services. The payment service providers may, in some cases, use your personal data for their own purposes, such as to detect and prevent fraud attempts and to comply with legal requirements applicable to them.When a chargeback is requested for your trip reservation, either by you or by the holder of the credit card used to make your reservation, we need to share certain reservation details with the payment service provider and the relevant financial service organization so they can handle the chargeback. This may also include a copy of your reservation confirmation or the IP address used to make your reservation.We may also share information with relevant financial institutions if we consider it strictly necessary for fraud prevention purposes, for example, to prevent the fraudulent use of a stolen credit card.Marketing servicesWe may share some of your personal data (such as identifiers) with advertising partners as part of the marketing of our trip services via third parties (to ensure that relevant advertisements are shown to the right audience).We use techniques such as hashing specific personal data (e.g. email address, phone number) to enable matching with data in one or more of their databases. Such techniques limit what the receiving third-party company can do with the personal data we selectively share with them.Other professional third partiesIn some cases (e.g. disputes, legal claims, or as part of auditing activities), we may need to share your personal data with representatives of professional service organizations. These representatives can include legal counsels at law firms as well as auditors. We only share your personal data to the extent that is necessary and in line with contractual and other obligations applicable to them.Competent authoritiesWe follow specific protocols when law enforcement agencies and other government bodies request us to disclose to them personal data about one or more travelers in connection with a possible criminal matter. We may also disclose personal data to law enforcement agencies in connection with possible cases of fraud.We follow similar protocols where, for example, EU and local laws additionally require us to share personal data with the competent authority, such as a tax authority. Such disclosures by us may be required to:Comply with a legal obligation, for instance, under applicable short-term rental lawsProtect and defend our rights or the rights and interests of our business partners.Other business partnersWe may share personal data in other instances with other business partners. These include:Insurance companies: If an insurance claim is made, concerning you and a trip provider, we may provide the necessary data (including personal data) to the insurance company and their appointed representatives for further processing.Other trip providers: We may present you with a “Partner offer.” When you book a stay marked “Partner offer,” your reservation will be facilitated by a trip provider who is separate from the accommodation you’re booking. As part of the reservation process, we’ll need to share some relevant personal data with this trip provider. If you book a “Partner offer,” review the information provided in the reservation process or check your reservation confirmation for more information about the trip provider and how your personal data will be further processed by them.Safeguards for international transfers of personal dataBooking.com is a business that connects travelers and partners around the world. The data that we collect from you, as described in this privacy statement, could be made accessible from, transferred to, or stored in countries that may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you initially provided the information. In any case, we apply appropriate safeguards to make sure that cross-border transfers of personal data comply with applicable law and seek to ensure that your data continues to receive a comparable level of protection.In particular, if you’re in the European Economic Area (EEA) and your personal data is transferred to third-party service providers in countries not considered adequate by the European Commission (EC), we establish and implement appropriate contractual, organizational, and technical measures with these third-party companies. This is done by using Standard Contractual Clauses as approved by the EC, by examining the countries to which the data may be transferred, and by imposing specific technical and organizational measures.In certain cases, we transfer your data outside the EEA because it’s necessary to conclude or perform the contract we have with you. For example, if you make a trip reservation involving a trip provider or strategic partner operating outside the EEA, it’s likely to require that we transfer data about your specific reservation outside of the EEA.For transfers of your personal data outside of the United Kingdom (UK), we apply the equivalent mechanisms and appropriate safeguards for the UK.You can ask us for more information on our implemented safeguards by contacting us as described in the section Your rights.Information regarding specific markets and products & servicesDepending on the type of product or service that concerns you and other factors such as where you live, we may have additional information to provide you that supplements or even replaces the information elsewhere in this notice. Review the sections below that apply to you in order to get the full picture.Ground transportationIf your use of our services includes ground transportation, the information in this section applies to you. It adds to, or replaces, the information in other parts of this privacy statement.In addition to what we list in Personal data you give to us, for a car rental reservation we might also ask for your home address, billing address, phone number, date and place of birth, passport and driver’s license info, government-issued ID (where required by law), and the names of any additional drivers. For a private or public transport reservation, we might ask for your pick-up and drop-off address (if you book a ride or airport transfer). We might also ask for your date of birth or age range for some public transportation tickets (e.g. child or senior tickets) and the names of any additional passengers.In addition to what is described in the Personal data we receive from other sources section, car rental, private, or public transit companies may also share information about you with us. This could happen if you need support with or have questions about a pending reservation, or if disputes or other issues arise about a reservation.In addition to what is described in Purposes of collecting and processing your personal data, we may use your personal data in relation to customer reviews. During and after your trip, we might invite you to submit a review.

Generally, we keep your personal data for as long as is necessary to:Enable you to use our services or to provide our services to youPrevent and detect online fraud attempts and/or other illegal activitiesComply with legal obligations such as those from accounting and tax lawsResolve any disputes and legal claimsHow you can further protect your personal data on Booking.comWhile not mandatory for your use of Booking.com’s platform, we recommend that you:Use a user account where available on our platform. By using a user account, you can protect access to your data (e.g. your reservation history, your Wallet) with a strong password as well as two-factor authentication.Use unique passwords for every online service including for your access to Booking.com. If you reuse user account and password combinations across multiple services on the internet and one of them suffers a data leak, malicious actors typically try using the same combinations to access your user accounts on other online services, such as Booking.com. Where we detect such malicious attacks to the detriment of travelers, we take countermeasures rapidly, such as blocking user accounts at risk and alerting account holders.Read (and follow the guidance from) articles we may make available to travelers and partners about online fraud prevention and data protection. Online fraud attempts typically involve social engineering and “phishing” schemes where scammers may pretend to be, for example, a specific accommodation and ask for payment when it’s not necessary. You should contact Customer Service if you suspect there is a possible fraud attempt in connection with your reservation.How we use cookies & other tracking technologiesWhenever you use our online services or mobile apps, we may use tracking technologies (which include, and we collectively refer to as, “cookies”). This section of the privacy statement provides information about how we use cookies.What are cookies?A web browser cookie is a small text file placed by a website in the data that a web browser automatically stores on your computer or mobile device. It enables software to store information about the content you view and interact with, for example, to:Remember your preferences, settings, and items in your shopping cartAnalyze how you use online servicesWe also use other types of cookies. For example, our websites, email messages, and mobile apps may contain small transparent image files or lines of code that record how you interact with them.What are cookies used for?Cookies we use can be divided into three purpose categories: functional, analytical, and marketing cookies.Functional cookiesWe use functional cookies to enable our websites and mobile apps to work properly so you can create an account, sign in, and manage bookings. They also remember your selected currency, language, and past searches. These technical cookies must be enabled to use our site and services.Analytical cookiesWe and our partners use analytical cookies to gain information on your website and mobile app usage, which is then used to understand how visitors like you use our platform and to improve the performance of our site and services.Marketing cookiesWe and our partners use marketing cookies, including social media cookies, to collect information about your browsing behavior that helps us and our partners decide which products to show you on and off our site, to display and send personalized content and advertisements on our platform, other websites, and via push messages and email. The personalized content is based on your browsing and services you have booked. These cookies also allow you to share or like pages on social media.We work with selected third-party companies to collect and process data. We may also sometimes share information (e.g. your email address or phone number) with some of these third parties so they can link that information to other data they collect separately (and typically independently of Booking.com) to help us engage with specific audiences or deliver targeted ads.What are your choices?When required, we offer you the option to decline analytical and marketing cookies. Most browsers will also allow you to choose which cookies to accept and which to reject. See the help function of your browser to learn more. Note that if you choose to block certain functional cookies, you may not be able to use or benefit from some features of our services.How we use artificial intelligence and make automated decisionsWe are always looking for opportunities to innovate and improve the customer experience by using new technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) systems. We currently use AI for the following purposes:Promotion of a safe and trustworthy service and prevention of fraudMachine learning AI systems monitor our platforms for fraud attempts, complaints, and possible traveler or trip provider misconduct at a much faster rate and with greater accuracy than could be achieved manually. The AI systems scan transactions and content on our platform for risk indicators. Transactions and content that are identified as indicative of higher fraud risk are flagged for human review.Showing you the most relevant contentWe use additional AI systems to improve the customer experience and personalization on our platform. This includes the use of AI to predict the optimal/most relevant category of products for you and bring the best options to your attention. This may include sending you details of a trip we think you would be interested in (where you have consented to this communication) and ranking search results to put the best matches at the top of your feed.Our “How we work” page contains more information on our recommendation systems, including on how to manage your personalization preferences.AI Trip Planner and Interactive chatsWe may use AI to develop and offer interactive chats and the Booking.com AI Trip Planner, which allow you to ask questions about a trip or service and receive AI-generated relevant responses or itinerary suggestions. The AI Trip Planner will use any personal data you share with it and your search and booking history on our platform to make tailored recommendations to you. We may use the above information to develop, train, and fine-tune our AI systems.Improving our servicesWe use AI to improve trip services in line with the information included in the Purposes of collecting and processing your personal data section. This includes the identification of trends, monitoring operations of the platform, troubleshooting our websites and apps, as well as achieving performance and cost efficiencies. Personal data may be used to develop and train AI systems like generative AI models, which enable you to use natural language to ask questions about a trip or service and receive relevant AI-generated responses or itinerary suggestions. AI systems will also be utilized to improve the effectiveness of the other purposes set out in this privacy notice.We ensure we have a legal basis to use AI systems in accordance with data protection laws. The legal basis of using AI will usually follow the overall purpose of processing set out in the section Purposes of collecting and processing your personal data :Beyond preventing and detecting fraud attempts, we may have a legitimate interest in developing AI systems to reduce our costs, improve the efficiency and quality of our processing, and provide better products for our customers. We consider whether your rights and freedoms aren’t unduly infringed upon by the processing of your personal data and only proceed where this legitimate interest isn’t overridden by your rights.In other cases where we may use AI, we’ll seek your consent where this is required.We assess our AI systems against data protection principles, such as minimization, accuracy, and purpose limitation. We take steps to prevent harm and biases from our use of AI, for example, by:De-identifying personal dataDeveloping our own systems to reduce sharing data with third partiesRe-assessing our use of AI systems to ensure risks continue to be adequately mitigatedSee the How we protect your personal data section for more information on the safeguards we’ve implemented, which will also apply to personal data we process to train or use AI.We don’t currently use any solely automated systems, including those using AI, to make a decision about you that would result in a legal or similarly significant effect on you. We’ll inform you if this changes and will ensure that we’ve implemented suitable measures to safeguard your rights and freedoms.In some cases, we may complete decision-making without human review but only after we’ve assessed that the decision wouldn’t result in a significant effect on you.In cases that may have a significant effect on an individual (e.g. monitoring for fraud attempts), our systems may inform and contribute to a decision but won’t autonomously make any decision. A member of our team will review a possible issue a system may identify and make an informed decision.If you’d like to know more about our use of AI systems or would like to object to the use of your personal data in the context of AI, contact us as described in the Your rights section.How we treat personal data belonging to minorsOur services are not intended for people under the age of 18.
