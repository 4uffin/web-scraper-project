The communities that support open source development consistently look for new ways to make infrastructure more interoperable and scalable, and support new technologies, and AI is no exception. As more organizations increase their investment in AI, more developers are looking to see how they can integrate open source AI as part of their tech stack.
Many developers now prefer open-source AI frameworks over proprietary APIs and software. According to the Linux Foundationâs report, The Economic and Workforce Impacts of Open Source AI, 89% of organizations that have adopted AI use open-source AI in some form for their infrastructure.
In this article, we explore the widespread adoption of open source AI among developers and researchers, driven by significant investments from tech giants. We also delve into how this adoption promises transformative technologies for organizations.
Key article takeaways
Open source AI is the use of freely available AI code and systems that operate under free and open source software licenses. It can be shared, modified, studied, and distributed at no cost.
Open source AI provides the benefits of interoperability, low to no overhead cost, and greater customization options for feature sets and data compatibility.
Challenges of open source AI include an increased learning curve, limited dataset availability, and potentially limited use cases.
Top open source AI platforms include TensorFlow, Pytorch, Open AI, and OpenCV.
What is open source AI?
Open source AI is an AI system, model, or algorithm with freely accessible source code that you can use, modify, study, and share for your AI projects. It exists under free and open source software licenses, such as the Apache, MIT, BSD-3, and GNU General Public licenses.
This openness encourages the creation of creative AI applications as a community of enthusiasts collaborates, expediting the development of practical solutions.
These projects, available on platforms like GitHub, enable innovation across sectors such as healthcare, finance, and education. The availability of AI frameworks on diverse operating systems like Microsoft Windows, Linux, iOS, and Android empowers developers to address complex challenges efficiently. The more popular applications of open source AI include large language models, machine translation tools, and chatbots.
Open source AI democratizes access to cutting-edge technologies and accelerates the development of impactful applications for a range of enterprise use cases.
When to use open source AI
Using open source AI can be beneficial in certain use cases, depending on your goals for using AI, as well as your organizationâs resources. This is because open source AI has minimal (if any) overhead costs, can be adjusted to your organizationâs specific data sets, and offers customizable features compared to closed source or proprietary AI models. With these characteristics, open source AI is ideal if you have the time to experiment with custom data sets, have specific parameters around how you can use company data with third-party software, or want to try out a specialized AI use case.
You should use open source AI specifically if you:
Have custom organizational data you want to use for model training and deployment.
Want to train the AI model for a specific industry or use case, and have it understand the context and terminology of your application.
Require specific functions or features that arenât available in out-of-the-box AI models or platforms.
Need your AI model to match the company style, workflow, and formats with its specific outputs.
Training data for open source AI
Open source AI models require data to effectively produce accurate and relevant outcomes. Yet how do you gather data for a technology that is based on community support and available to both enthusiasts and professional developers? You might already be using these open source models with your company data, but if you donât have readily available data, you must find it online and make sure it is also open source and is properly licensed so you can use it without pushback. This has led to several open source large-language model training sets being curated and available within the open source community:
Common Crawl
Starcoder Data
Red Pajama
ROOTS
When using data for your open source AI model, you want to make sure that the data is effectively labeled, clear of any duplicate entries, has enough data for the model to learn new information, and does not contain any sensitive or proprietary information.
Advantages of open source AI
Open-source AI has emerged as a powerful force in driving innovation and accessibility across various fields. Its unique characteristics offer significant advantages for developers, researchers, and organizations alike. The key benefits include:
Diverse use cases: Open source AI platform offers a wide array of practical applications, such as real-time fraud detection, medical image analysis, personalized recommendations, and tailored learning experiences.

Vendor neutrality: Open source AI solutions ensure organizations are not bound to any specific vendor, which allows you to build out your tech stack with flexibility and helps you achieve more interoperability between software tools.
Challenges and considerations of open source AI
While open-source AI does provide flexibility and itâs crucial to acknowledge and mitigate its inherent challenges:
Risk of misalignment and failure: Embarking on custom AI development without clear objectives can result in misaligned outcomes, resource waste, and project failure. These projects also usually have a higher learning curve and require specific programming and data analysis skill sets.
Bias in algorithms: Biased algorithms have the potential to generate flawed results and perpetuate harmful assumptions, undermining the reliability and usefulness of AI solutions.
Security concerns: The accessibility of open source AI raises security concerns, as malicious actors could exploit these tools to manipulate outcomes or create harmful content.
Data-related issues: Biased training data can lead to discriminatory outcomes, while data drift and labeling errors can render AI models ineffective and unreliable. There are also concerns around how to effectively gather open source data for AI models.
Outsourced technology risks: Enterprises using open-source AI solutions from external sources may expose their stakeholders to risks, emphasizing the importance of cautious consideration and responsible implementation.
