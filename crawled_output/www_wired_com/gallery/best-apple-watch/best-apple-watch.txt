Or will the SE do? Let us help you figure out which version to get (and which to avoid).CommentLoaderSave StorySave this storyCommentLoaderSave StorySave this storyIf you have an iPhone, the Apple Watch is the best wearable to go with it. But what's the best Apple Watch to buy? Just a little while ago, this question was more complicated. In 2024, a court ruling dictated that Apple could no longer sell the Series 9, the Watch Ultra 2, and the Series 10 with a blood oxygen sensor. Medical technology company Masimo alleged that Apple had infringed on its patent. However, in August 2025, Apple redesigned the sensor via a software update, and you now have this feature again. Blood oxygen sensing is back!Apple revamped its entire Apple Watch line this year, which includes the entry-level Watch SE 3, the flagship Watch Series 11, and the Watch Ultra 3. This is the first year that I feel fairly confident about saying yes, if you're in the market, you should buy a new one. I love the Apple Watch. 10 years on, it's still the beautiful, Jony Ive–designed wearable everyone with an iPhone has to have. It is the watch I'd wear if I weren't constantly testing other fitness trackers. (Now my children test them as well.) If you need help telling them apart, I break down which one is best for you and whether older models are worth the price.Wondering what the operating system for these watches will look like?

Here are the ones for you to consider first.A 3-in-1 charger. Apple Watches are notoriously hard to keep charged. This Belkin Qi2 charger ($110) is our favorite stand, but we have many more selections in our Best 3-in-1 Apple Wireless Chargers. You can also pick up a power bank ($90) with a built-in Apple Watch charger so you're not caught outside with a dead watch.Whatever band you want. Our Best Apple Watch Accessories guide has a ton of options. My personal favorite band of all time is the Konsu NYC supple leather band ($139), but we have many more in our guide.A case and a screen protector. Apple's service pricing is notoriously exorbitant—repairing a watch costs almost as much as buying a new one! Bigger and more expensive isn't always better. If the case is big and doesn't fit well, it will rattle annoyingly every time you get a notification. I like the Spigen Thin Fit Case ($15) and a screen protector set from Amazon ($10); extras are nice if you mess up the first application.Avoid These WatchesIt's been years since we've seen retailers carry the Series 1, Series 2, or Series 3. You may see them on resale sites, but they are not worth the price. WatchOS 26 only works with the second-gen SE and newer, so we no longer recommend buying the Series 4 or 5, or the first-gen SE. The Series 1 isn't waterproof; neither the Series 1 nor the Series 2 has any cellular capability; and none of these watches are compatible with the latest watchOS version.Power up with unlimited access to WIRED.
