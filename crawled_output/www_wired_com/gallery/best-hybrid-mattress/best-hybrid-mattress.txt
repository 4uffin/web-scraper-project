There are always going to be a few key ingredients—in the case of a mattress, that's springs and foam. Those two elements are layered up and combined with an almost endless assortment of other ingredients (latex, coils, foam layers of various densities, assorted fabrics). The art is in the details of the recipe, and mattress brands are carefully combining each ingredient in a specific ratio to create a comfortable bed.Hybrid mattresses are what we recommend for most people because when they're done right, they're soft but supportive and much more breathable than an all-foam bed. The only way to pick the best is to sleep on them, which is why I or any other WIRED reviewer spends a week or more sleeping on each bed, taking careful notes, and then comparing them with teammates' experiences if they have also tested that particular bed. Very rarely does one bed work for everybody, so this is especially crucial to find options tailored to your height, weight, sleeping position, and overall mattress wish list (for example, a cooling cover may be nonnegotiable for you).We have tested all sorts of mattresses, from those focused on side sleepers, helping with back pain, organic options, and even what we deem the best mattresses overall.Jump to SectionAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronCompare Our Top PicksHow We Test MattressesHow Does WIRED Acquire the Mattresses to Test?What Does WIRED Do With the Mattresses After Testing Them?Best OverallPhotograph: Martin CizmarCourtesy of LeesaChevronChevronLeesaSapira Chill$2,264 $1,584 (30% off) LeesaOur fearless director and WIRED reviewer Martin Cizmar really, really, really likes the Leesa Sapira Chill. It's been on our list of the best mattresses for a long time due to its comfortable hybrid construction. It features a temperature-regulating cover (which Martin reports effectively absorbs excess heat), a quilted pillow top that gently sinks in, four types of memory foam, and pocketed coils.Each memory foam layer is designed to be breathable, keeping the cover from mimicking a baking sheet, while also serving its own purpose in terms of pressure relief and support. The topmost quilted layer and comfort layer are thicker and softer for a deeper sink, while the bottom responsive and transitional layers are designed for enhanced support. The pocketed coil core is also beneficial for heightened support in areas that require it most, specifically the lumbar zone. Coils are arranged in zones, so you get a firmer feel around your midsection. This helped Martin alleviate his back pain during testing. Plus, reinforced coils along the edge help with durability and edge support.MaterialsMemory foam, pocketed coils, cooling coverCertificationsCertiPur-US certified foam, GreenGuard GoldFirmnessPlush, medium-firm, firmHeight14 inchesTrial period100 nightsWarrantyLimited lifetimeBest Hybrid Mattress for Side SleepersCourtesy of NolahNolahEvolution$2,127 $1,489 (30% off) NolahWe're all familiar with Goldilocks (and how often that's used in mattress reviews—sorry, stick with me here) and her plight of trying to find a bed with the right firmness. That's not too far off from the average side sleeper's mattress experience. Finding the “just right” balance means getting something soft enough for your hips and shoulders to press into the bed without causing irritation. While doing that, it also has to be not too soft, because spine alignment is so important. With that in mind, the Nolah Evolution rises to the task—probably because it was developed for side sleepers.It just so happens that this is the mattress I sleep on when I'm not testing. I especially appreciate that the quilted foam and four foam layers underneath excel in pressure relief—I love feeling cocooned in my bed. Two layers in particular stand out: the AirFoam Luxe layer that's meant to keep firm lumbar support in place, and the TriZone Foam, which also adds a firm foam layer. If that weren't enough, zoned coils are present. Like the Sapira Chill, the firmest coils are right in the center. Back pain? Not in my house.MaterialsAirFoam, memory foam, pocketed coils, organic cotton cover, GlacioTex pillow top (upcharge)CertificationsCertiPur-US certified foams, GreenGuard GoldFirmnessPlush, luxury firm, firmHeight14 inchesTrial period120 nightsWarrantyLimited lifetimeBest Hybrid Mattress for Back PainPhotograph: Nena FarrellCourtesy of BearChevronChevronBearElite Hybrid (Firm)$2,427 $1,578 (35% off) BearThe Bear Elite Hybrid offers three firmness levels to choose from: standard soft, medium, and firm. However, if there's one thing that testers with back pain on our team believe in, it's the power of a firm mattress for support. Two WIRED reviewers have tested this mattress: Martin Cizmar and Nena Farrell. Both regularly deal with back pain, and they found that the firm Bear Elite Hybrid model really did the trick for lumbar support. They note that while it feels quite firm at first, the mattress feels more and more welcoming as time goes on.The mattress cover uses phase change material, which sucks up heat and makes it feel cool to the touch. If you have incredibly awful back pain, though, you may want to consider the $210 Celliant cover, an infrared-infused fabric. We haven't tried it, but it supposedly helps with recovery. You've also got copper-infused foam for even more cooling, plus transition foam for pressure relief purposes. Surprise, surprise, there's also zoned pocketed coils, so those coils located in the middle are doing the heavy lifting.MaterialsCopper-infused memory foam, memory foam, pocketed coils, phase-change material cover, Celliant cover (upcharge)CertificationsCertiPur-US certified foams, GreenGuard GoldFirmnessSoft, medium, firmHeight14 inchesTrial period120 nightsWarrantyLimited lifetimeBest Hybrid Mattress for CouplesPhotograph: Julia ForbesPhotograph: Julia ForbesPhotograph: Julia ForbesChevronChevronWolfMemory Foam Hybrid Premium Firm Mattress$1,199 Wolf$1,100 AmazonI always empathize with couples attempting to mattress shop, because it's a tall order trying to find a suitable bed for two of everything: body types, sleeping positions, temperature preferences, and pain points. The Wolf Memory Foam Hybrid Premium Firm is a well-rounded, supportive hybrid mattress for couples (and their extracurriculars, if you catch my drift).Its cooling cover does an outstanding job of staying cool-feeling, with a gel foam layer underneath that provides extra support. Four more layers of memory foam are present for pressure relief, which, from experience, it more than delivers on. You then have your pocketed coils in the middle, which lift heavier areas with firmer-feeling support. Overall, I ranked it as a medium-firm, 6.5 out of 10, that was doable for all kinds of sleepers regardless of their build or sleeping position.MaterialsMemory foam, pocketed coils, cooling coverCertificationsCertiPur-US certified foamsFirmnessMedium firmHeight13 inchesTrial period101 nightsWarrantyLimited lifetimeBest Cooling Hybrid MattressPhotograph: Molly HigginsCourtesy of BedgearChevronChevronBedgearH Performance Mattress$1,699 Amazon (H4)$1,799 BedgearShout-out to all of my hot sleepers out there: At the end of the day, we literally want to cool off. Many mattresses claim to be cooling, but Bedgear's H Series takes the hybrid cake, according to WIRED reviewer Molly Higgins. From top to bottom, this was a mattress made with cooling in mind. There are two versions, the H4 (medium-firm) and the H6 (medium-plush). Either way, you're looking at some superb cooling.The cooling cover on this bed uses a proprietary material called Ver-Tex, which felt silky and noticeably cool to the touch during Molly's testing. This cover's not doing all the work, though, as there are Air-X side panels that Molly describes as “meshlike” and are meant for air circulation. The memory foam layers on top are your best friend when it comes to pressure relief, and the pocketed coil core is contained within a foam perimeter for added edge support.MaterialsMemory foam, Ver-Tex cover, Air-X panels, pocketed coilsCertificationsCertiPur-US certified foamsFirmnessH4 (medium firm), H6 (medium plush)Height12 inchesTrial period30 nightsWarranty10-year limitedBest Memory Foam HybridPhotograph: Julia ForbesPhotograph: Julia ForbesPhotograph: Julia ForbesChevronChevronDreamCloudHybrid Mattress$1,698 $649 (62% off) DreamCloudMost of the time, when I encounter a hybrid, it involves some variation of memory foam and coils. Many brands put their own twist on foam—and coils, for that matter—so it's often switched up for a unique mattress experience. Sometimes that experience is good, and others, not so good. But if there's ever a hybrid mattress that nailed this balance, it's the DreamCloud Classic Hybrid.DreamCloud expertly put together pressure-relieving foams, pocketed coils, and a temperature-regulating cover to create its Classic Hybrid. It's got a quilted surface, not a pillow top, but it still delivers on the pressure relief front. The medium-firm feel really supports stomach and back sleepers, but I've never had any complaints while sleeping on my side.MaterialsMemory foam, pocketed coils, CloudQuilt coverCertificationsCertiPur-US certified foamsFirmnessMedium firmHeight12 inchesTrial period365 nightsWarrantyLimited lifetimeBest Organic Hybrid MattressCourtesy of BirchBirchLuxe Natural Mattress$2,624 $1,968 (25% off) BirchHybrid mattresses aren't always just memory foam and coil pairings. While that does make up a good majority of the market (as far as I've seen), some people simply don't want that. Enter: natural, organic materials. In hybrid mattress mode, they're effective options that make them good contenders even if you weren't looking for something within this category. A prime example of this would be the Birch Luxe Natural.According to WIRED reviewer Scott Gilbertson, the mix of organic wool, GOLS-certified latex, GOTS-certified organic cotton, and pocketed coils was a winning combination for responsive support. There's a lot to celebrate about latex, like its hypoallergenic status and natural heat resistance. The Luxe's pillow top added that cherry-on-top bit of luxury to sink into, while the rest of the mattress did plenty to help with spinal support.MaterialsOrganic cotton, organic wool, organic latex, pocketed coilsCertificationsGOLS certified latex, GreenGuard GoldFirmnessMedium firmHeight12 inchesTrial period100 nightsWarrantyLimited lifetimeBest Hybrid Mattress for Pain ReliefPhotograph: Nena FarrellCourtesy of SaatvaChevronChevronSaatvaRx$3,399 $2,999 (12% off) SaatvaAs a side sleeper who struggles with chronic illness, I require support and pressure relief in a mattress. This is where I like the Saatva Rx as a specialty option for those dealing with literal pain points. The Rx, if you couldn't already infer from the name, was designed for more medically inclined situations where you need to treat joints with care.By following a hybrid design of therapeutic foams and pocketed coils, the Rx manages to pull this off. While this may not be the firmest option to support sleepers with back pain, WIRED reviewer Nena Farrell found that the softer appeal speaks to side sleepers. She reports that her joints felt weightless with no pressure buildup. The Rx features an organic cotton cover, support quilting, and a focused layer in the middle of the bed for lumbar support, incorporating microcoils, phase-change material, and graphite-infused memory foams. Additionally, it includes pocketed coils, with extra reinforcement on the edges for enhanced edge support. Another perk for pain purposes? This mattress also comes with included white glove delivery, so you won't have to handle the setup and removal of your old mattress.MaterialsOrganic cotton cover, lumbar support foam, foam infused with gel, graphite, and phase-change material, micro coils, pocketed coilsCertificationsCertiPur-US certified foams, GreenGuard GoldFirmnessSupportive plushHeight12 inchesTrial period365 nightsWarrantyLimited lifetimeCompare Our Top PicksMattressHybrid MaterialsCertificationsFirmnessHeightTrial PeriodWarrantyLeesa Sapira ChillMemory foam, pocketed coils, cooling coverCertiPur-US foam, GreenGuard GoldPlush, medium-firm, firm14 inches100 nightsLimited lifetimeNolah EvolutionAirFoam, memory foam, pocketed coils, organic cotton cover, GlacioTex pillow top (upcharge)CertiPur-US certified foams, GreenGuard GoldPlush, luxury firm, firm14 inches120 nightsLimited lifetimeBear Elite HybridCopper-infused memory foam, memory foam, pocketed coils, Phase Change Material (PCM) cover, Celliant cover (upcharge)CertiPur-US certified foams, GreenGuard GoldSoft, medium, firm14 inches120 nighgtsLimited lifetimeWolf Memory Foam Hybrid Premium FirmMemory foam, pocketed coils, cooling coverCertiPur-US certified foamsMedium firm13 inches101 nightsLimited lifetimeBedGear H Performance MattressMemory foam, Ver-Tex cover, Air-X panels, pocketed coilsCertiPur-US certified foamsH4 (medium firm), H6 (medium plush)12 inches30 nights10 year limitedDreamCloud Classic Hybrid MattressMemory foam, pocketed coils, CloudQuilt coverCertiPur-US certified foamsMedium firm12 inches365 nightsLimited lifetimeBirch Luxe Natural MattressOrganic cotton, organic wool, organic latex, pocketed coilsGOLS certified latex, GreenGuard GoldMedium firm12 inches100 nightsLimited lifetimeSaatva RxOrganic cotton cover, lumbar support foam, gel infused foam, graphite- and phase change material-infused foam, micro coils, pocketed coilsCertiPur-US certified foams, GreenGuard GoldSupportive plush15 inches365 nightsLimited lifetimeFrequently Asked QuestionsHow We Test MattressesAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWe know how anxiety-producing it is to make a decision sight-unseen as to what you may end up spending 10 years sleeping on. To that end, we spend a week or more testing these mattresses in our own homes, sleeping on them, relaxing on them, and just overall using them as a consumer would, to get insight on comfort, support, materials, and any other details that pop up. To give us some concrete data (since we're not exactly conscious during testing), sleep trackers keep tags on our progress.How Does WIRED Acquire Mattresses to Test?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronAll mattresses chosen for this guide were either samples provided by the manufacturer, with no obligation for coverage or promises for what coverage could look like, or purchased by us and expensed.What Does WIRED Do With the Mattresses After Testing Them?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronOnce testing is complete, the mattresses are donated locally within the tester's geographic region.Power up with unlimited access to WIRED.
