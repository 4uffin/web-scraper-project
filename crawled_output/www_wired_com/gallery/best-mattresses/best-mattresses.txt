A new mattress can cost thousands of dollars, and you'll be spending a lot of time on it over the following decade. With that in mind, your search for the best mattress online is not helped by the explosion of bed-in-a-box brands. The countless options can be overwhelming. Trust us, we’ve been there.For the past seven years, the WIRED Reviews team has worked (and slept!) hard to remove as much guesswork as possible. Our team has collectively tested more than 100 bed-in-a-box mattresses in that time to present our absolute favorites here. Unlike many other review sites, we test mattresses the old-fashioned way: By sleeping on them in our own home for at least a week. Our overall favorite, the Helix Midnight Luxe, has remained our top pick for years. Below, you'll find a deeper explanation of our methodology and answers to some of the big questions we get asked about mattresses.We've got a few other helpful sleep guides, including the Best Organic Mattresses, Best Mattress Toppers, and Best Sheets.Updated August 2025: We've added the DreamCloud Hybrid and S&S Organic mattresses to our honorable mentions and updated prices throughout. We've also added links to new stories we've published to help you sleep better, including explainers on mattress types, mattress shopping terms to know, and how to clean your mattress.Jump To SectionAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronCompare Our Top PicksHonorable MentionsMattresses to AvoidFrequently Asked QuestionsBest Mattress OverallCourtesy of Helix SleepHelix SleepMidnight Luxe Hybrid Mattress (14-Inch)$2,373 $1,799 (24% off) Helix SleepOne of the most popular bed-in-a-box mattresses for good reason, Helix's Midnight Luxe has a plush cushion top and a medium-firm feel that's relaxing whether you're a side, back, or stomach sleeper.Helix is almost vertically integrated—the springs are made from wire bales cut in the company's Arizona factory, where it also pours its own foam. Those springs are individually wrapped and zoned so that you have firmer coils in areas like your lower spine that need more support to prevent back pain. Above that is a stratum of cooling gel foam and denser foams. There are six layers total and the mattress is more than 13 inches high, so buy sheets with nice deep pockets. It's cozy, and Helix has a variety of other mattresses› that cater to different sleeping positions and firmness preferences—part of what makes this high-quality mattress our longtime pick is there are so many ways to customize it to suit your needs and preferences.The Helix Midnight Luxe has been our top pick for seven years now, but we have continued testing it against the competition. Last year, I spent a month testing a version of the Helix Midnight Luxe with a super dense layer of contouring foam called ErgoAlign, which targets lower back pain, and a proprietary cooling cover called GlacioTex. The cooling layer has been only moderately effective, but the contouring foam made a big difference. The denser foam runs along your torso and offers side sleepers lots of support while also leaving plenty of give for your hips and shoulders. Helix has a 100-day at-home trial (with a required 30-day break-in period) and a 10-year warranty on manufacturing flaws. —Martin CizmarHelix Midnight Luxe ranges from $1,436 for a twin mattress to $2,924 for a California King.Mattress typeHybridMaterialsTencel cover, memory foams, pocketed coilsCertificationsCertiPur-US, GreenGuard GoldSizes availableTwin, twin XL, full, queen, king, California king, short queen, RV kingFirmness optionsMediumAdd-ons availableGlacioTex cooling cover, CoolForce Layer, ErgoAlign Contour LayerShipping costsFree for customers in the contiguous USDelivery optionsDelivered in six to 10 days in a box; setup handled by customerTrial period100 nights; 30 day break in period required before initiating returnWarrantyLimited lifetimeWIRED/TIREDAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWIREDLots of features designed to benefit side sleepers, which most people are for at least part of the night.Excellent pressure relief.Adaptable support for the lower back via pocketed coilsTIREDCustomizations can quickly add up.

Can’t decide if a memory foam mattress or strictly coils is going to be a better fit for you? Well, with hybrid mattresses, you can enjoy both. Depending on what issues are disturbing your rest, the Leesa Sapira Chill Hybrid may be the tonic for what ails you. That’s especially true if you struggle with a few interrelated problems—like getting too hot so you kick your covers off and roll over in the process, twisting your spine.The Leesa Sapira hybrid was our longtime runner-up to the Helix, and it’s still a mattress we endorse. I like the Sapira Chill even better, though, after two weeks of retesting last year. Not only does it provide a nice dose of cooling thanks to a fabric cover that pulls heat away from the body, but it also delivers deep comfort via four foam layers and three different types of coil, which are artfully arranged in zones that gracefully align your hips. The Sapira's structure eliminated my periodic lower back pain in testing. (The next mattress I tested, the Magnistretch in the avoid section below, brought that pain back with a vengeance!)The Leesa Sapira Chill is an affordable luxury mattress, with a plush quilted pillowtop and three available firmness levels. It has a little more springiness than other hybrids thanks to a bouncy, responsive foam layer that takes the place of memory foam in many other hybrids. You also get premium touches like an outer ring of extra-firm springs for excellent edge support and a chemical-free and fiberglass-free barrier against fires. There’s a 100-night at-home trial with free shipping and free returns. —Martin CizmarLeesa Sapira Chill ranges from $1,499 for a twin mattress to $2,589 for a California king.Mattress typeHybridMaterialsPhase change cooling cover, cooling memory foams, pocketed coilsCertificationsCertiPur-US, GreenGuard GoldSizes availableTwin, twin XL, full, queen, king, California kingFirmness optionsPlush, medium firm, firmAdd-ons availableGlacioTex cooling coverShipping costsFreeDelivery optionsArrives in a box as part of standard shipping in three to seven business days; white-glove delivery available within contiguous US (mattress set up and old bed removal) for $199Trial Period100 nights; 30-day break-in period required before initiating return.

It needs to have support, but not so much that it hurts. Also throw in things like keeping a cool feel, easily moving with you, and supporting you at the very edge of the bed. That’s quite the checklist, but nothing the Nolah Evolution Hybrid can’t handle.See, this was a bed designed by Nolah for side sleepers. You can pick a firmness level (plush soft, luxury firm, and firm) based on what you prefer, but side sleepers will more often than not stick to soft to medium territory. The Evolution has a cooling cover atop a Euro pillow top, all surrounded by a special “Heat Escape Gusset” mesh that helps to keep airflow going. The next few layers of the mattress’s construction really underscore how this was a bed made for side sleepers. An initial layer of AirFoam (memory foam, Nolah’s version) is perforated to keep a softer feel around your shoulders and legs, without compromising firmer support in the center of the bed for the lower back.Two more layers of transition foam are next, which serve not only as a cushiony barrier between the top foam layers and coils, but parlay pressure relief, motion isolation, and overall comfort. The pocketed coils are responsible for keeping your body level on the surface. Firmer coils are located in the middle, right where your lumbar is, so that the curvature isn’t compromised by sinking too far into the bed. This way, side sleepers enjoy the cushion around the hips and shoulders offered by the Euro top, without risking back pain. Another potential pain point is solved by way of Nolah’s coverage, as you get a 120-night sleep trial and limited lifetime warranty.Nolah Evolution Hybrid ranges from $1,460 for a twin mattress to $3,454 for a split king.Mattress typeHybridMaterialsOrganic cotton or GlacioTex cover, AirFoam Luxe memory foams, gel memory foam, AirBreath border gusset, pocketed coilsCertificationsCertiPur-US, GreenGuard GoldSizes availableTwin, twin XL, full, queen, king, California king, split kingFirmness optionsPlush, luxury firm, firmAdd-ons availableGlacioTex cooling coverShipping costsFree for customers in the contiguous USDelivery optionsArrives in a box as part of standard shipping; white-glove delivery available (mattress setup and old bed removal) for $225Trial period100 nights; 30-day break-in period required before initiating return ($99 shipping fee)WarrantyLimited lifetimeWIRED/TIREDAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWIREDThree firmness levels offer next-level customization.TIREDThe GlacioTex cooling pillow top costs an additional $210.Older iterations had cooling fibers woven into the organic cotton cover.

After another round of testing, the firm version is now my pick for back pain support, too. The Elite Hybrid is one of the firmest mattresses I’ve tried, and firmer mattresses are often recommended for people with back pain—the scientific literature suggests you want at least medium-firm. While it was ultra firm at first—firmer than the Plank I usually sleep on!—it was still forgiving enough for me to sleep comfortably as a side sleeper and wake up pain-free from my usual lower back problems. I suffer from both spondylosis and scoliosis in my back, and a mattress that lacks support will leave my back aching the next morning. I didn’t wake up from any side sleeper pressure pains, either.I’d choose the medium firmness for side sleepers, as we recommend in our side sleeper guide, but the firmest setting is great for back and mixed sleepers, or anyone who wants to be sure they’re getting the most support. —Nena FarrellBear Elite Hybrid ranges from $1,998 for a twin mattress to $4,282 for a split king.Mattress typeHybridMaterialsPhase change material (PCM) cooling cover, copper-infused memory foam, dynamic memory foam, pocketed coilsCertificationsCertiPur-US, GreenGuard GoldSizes availableTwin, twin XL, full, queen, king, California king, split kingFirmness optionsSoft, medium, firmAdd-ons availableCelliant-infused cooling coverShipping costsFree for customers in the contiguous U.S.Delivery optionsArrives in a box within three to seven business days; white-glove delivery service available.

The Birch Luxe is an all-around comfortable mattress that can help just about anyone get a good night's sleep since it strikes the best balance between firm and soft. (Birch calls it medium-firm.) It's a great choice for side sleepers while also working for people who sleep on their stomach or back. It's also great for people like Scott who sleep every which way.The medium-firm feel comes from individually wrapped steel coils, which are topped with layers of natural latex, wool, and a Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS)-certified organic cotton cover. The coils offer full lumbar support and are arranged to cradle your spine but are also stiff around the perimeter to offer solid edge support. There's no sag in the Birch Luxe, and Scott had none of the lower-back pain he associates with softer mattresses. The wool and latex top layers provide truly exceptional temperature regulation, and the pillowy top provides a nice bit of softness on the top. (The pillow top is the main thing that separates this from the cheaper, not-Luxe model.)Birch offers free shipping and a 100-night trial period, and all its products have a 25-year warranty. Birch also offers in-home setup and removal of your old mattress through LoadUp—details can be found on Birch's website. The Luxe arrived completely compressed, and while it was small, it was definitely heavy. If your mattress is headed upstairs, or you're not comfortable lifting bulky, heavy objects, we recommend the in-home setup option. —Martin CizmarBirch Luxe ranges from $1,624 for a twin mattress to $3,124 for a California king.Mattress typeHybridMaterialsOrganic cotton cover, wool, organic latex, pocketed coilsCertificationsGlobal Organic Latex Standard (GOLS), GreenGuard GoldSizes availableTwin, twin XL, full, queen, king, California kingFirmness optionsMediumAdd-ons availableBirch CoolForce LayerShipping costsFree via FedExDelivery optionsArrives in a box as part of standard shipping; white-glove delivery available for $199Trial period100 nights; 30-day break in period required before initiating return ($99 shipping fee)WarrantyLimited lifetimeWIRED/TIREDAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWIREDIf you can’t commit to one way of sleeping, latex is the material for you.It’s highly responsive—bouncy—which makes it adaptable enough to move alongside you as you snooze.TIREDIt has a “natural” smell to it … like wool fresh off the farm.

It is very good at support and temperature control, too. So if you were aiming for the trifecta of organic, supportive, and cool, the Avocado Green Hybrid hits the mark. The latex in this bed garners firmer support especially for stomach and back sleepers, but gives a little cushion where you need it most. When it comes to the most organic certifications in all the land, Avocado takes the crown (based on our testing and research to date, that is). It’s impressive that it’s accrued this much, because many brands out there usually cover basic certifications. However, that may only involve two to four stamps of approval from these organizations. But for proving how natural its latex and organic materials are, there is a whole checklist to contend with here.The Avocado's best trick is that it's incredibly comfortable and environmentally friendly. It's 11 inches thick and constructed in California from organic latex, organic wool, and organic cotton. It contains no polyurethane, fire retardants, memory foam, or chemical adhesives, according to the company. It offers a one-year trial, a 25-year warranty, and free shipping. Better yet, the company is also a certified B Corporation that's purchasing enough offsets to say it operates as a carbon-negative business. The Avocado Green hybrid mattress is the only bed WIRED reviewer Scott Gilbertson and his wife agree on. She likes a soft mattress, and he prefers a firm one. During Scott's two years of use when not testing another model, there was zero sagging or other issues.

The Saatva Rx is designed to relieve pain overnight, and I found it was perfect for relieving pressure pain. While this mattress is soft and comfortable, I didn’t develop any pressure-point pain overnight, as I usually would as a side sleeper (especially on a soft mattress). The Rx has seven layers, including a half-inch memory foam layer placed for lumbar support, a high-density foam layer encasing a micro-coil layer, and a layer Saatva calls the Therapeutic Support Core with a foam module on top of individually pocketed coils.There’s also phase-change material included in the design, which can help regulate temperature overnight. The top is especially soft and fluffy, but it wasn’t so soft that I sank deeply into it. It’s still a little too soft if you have back pain from spinal injuries or damage, so it didn’t solve all my aches. But the Rx left me with zero pressure-point pain while I slept on my favored side, and erased any hint of the muscle pain in my right leg and hip that comes from supporting my lopsided, scoliosis-wracked body all day. —Nena FarrellSaatva Rx ranges from $1,999 for a twin mattress to $3,999 for a California king.Mattress typeHybridMaterialsOrganic cotton cover, plant-based fire barrier, gel memory foam, graphite- and phase change material-infused foam, high density memory foam, micro coils, pocketed coilsCertificationsCertiPur-USSizes availableTwin, twin XL, full, queen, king, California king, split kingFirmness optionsSupportive plushAdd-ons availableAccessories onlyShipping costsWhite glove delivery for customers in the contiguous USDelivery options“In-room” mattress delivery and setup included, as well as old mattress and frame removalTrial period365 nights, return incurs $99 shipping feeWarrantyHybridWIRED/TIREDAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWIREDFantastic for pressure point reliefReally soft, but still relieves pressure even as you sink into the bedWhite-glove delivery is includedTIREDMarketed toward sleepers dealing with back pain, but is too soft for serious spinal or pain issuesDoesn't have the lumbar or firm support needed for folks who need spinal alignmentBest Innerspring MattressCourtesy of NaturepedicChevronChevronNaturepedicEOS Classic Organic Mattress$3,499 NaturepedicIf you're worried about buying the wrong mattress online, this option from Naturepedic is as safe a bet as they come. It's much more like a traditional innerspring mattress than many on this list if that's what you're after. With the right configuration, it's also a great pick for anyone looking for a firmer organic mattress. I've retested this bed in a medium-firm setup for the past three months with great satisfaction, having tested a slightly different setup a few years ago when I liked it enough to make it also recommended but not a top pick.The EOS (pronounced EEE-oz) is a multi-part zip-together system like the Helix Elite and Airweave below. In this case there's a cover that you put over separate layers of foam and individually wrapped coils. Be warned that getting these zippered systems to have totally taut and even edges is a chore I have not mastered; you may end up with a funky-looking corner or two unless you invest some time adjusting.The EOS is made with organic cotton, wool, and latex. It's a big and sturdy mattress that comes disassembled in three boxes. The biggest reason to buy, though, is the fact that you can swap out the five different latex layers for free for 100 nights, giving you the chance to fine-tune your firmness. After that you can still swap them but you'll have to buy the new layers—still a nice option if your body or preferences change, or if you get a new partner who has different needs.Naturepedic EOS ranges from $1,869 for a twin mattress to $3,654 for a California King.Mattress typeHybridMaterialsOrganic cotton cover, plant-based PLA layer, organic wool batting, organic latex, organic cotton batting, organic cotton fill and fabric, pocketed coilsCertificationsGlobal Organic Latex Standard (GOLS), Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS), Made Safe, EWG verified, GreenGuard Gold, Formaldehyde-Free Claim Verified by UL Environment, Organic Content Standard certified, Organic Trade Association certified, Responsible Wool Standard Certified, Forest Stewardship Council certifiedSizes availableTwin, twin XL, full, queen, king, California kingFirmness optionsPlush, medium, cushion firm, firm, extra firm (each side can have different firmnesses)Add-ons availableN/AShipping costsFree for customers in the contiguous USDelivery optionsArrives in a box as part of standard shipping.

She finds sleeping on a quarter-inch of foam over dirt to be both relaxing and good for her back. The Plank's high-density support foam took a few hours to fully inflate, which left both Adrienne and her spouse with a misleading initial impression of too much softness. But after a few days, it firmed up considerably. The 0.75-inch quilted top is barely perceptible. It's like sleeping on a clean wooden floor (this is a good thing for her).If this is too much for you, you can flip it over to sleep on 2 inches of comfort foam on the underside. But let’s be honest, if you’re ordering the Plank, you probably don’t want to do that. The foam also doesn’t move laterally, meaning kids can hop in and out of the parental bed with minimal shaking. Her one complaint is that the edges could use more support; she has slipped off the sides a few times while putting on her socks. —Martin CizmarPlank Firm ranges from $749 for a twin mattress to $1,532 for an RV king.Mattress typeHybridMaterialsQuilted fabric and foam, high-density foam, Supreme Response foamCertificationsCertiPur-US, GreenGuard GoldSizes availableTwin, twin XL, full, queen, king, California king, split king, split California king, short full, short queen, Olympic queen, short king, RV kingFirmness optionsFirm, extra firmAdd-ons availableGlacioTex cooling coverShipping costsFree for customers in the contiguous U.S.Delivery optionsArrives in a box as part of standard shippingTrial period120 nights; 30-day break in period required before initiating returnWarrantyLimited lifetimeWIRED/TIREDAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWIREDFlippable, with two different firmness levels on each sideGreat for super-firm supportMost comfortable for back sleepers, but also a great for side sleepers if you add a mattress topperTIREDTakes a few days to reach its full firmnessFirmer levels might be best for your spinal support, but could be too firm on a side sleeper's shouldersBest Mattress for Stomach SleepersPhotograph: Matthew KorfhageCourtesy of AirweaveCourtesy of AirweaveChevronChevronAirweaveTakumi 2.0$5,495 $5,195 (5% off) AirweaveAn Airweave mattress is not like other mattresses. Invented by Japanese entrepreneur Motokuni Takaoka, an Airweave mattress is supported not by springs but by airy polyethylene bricks that look for all the world like tangled cakes of dried noodle.The material is firm to the point of bouncy, but still breathable. This makes the mattress cool, quite literally. Compared to the previous-generation Advance Airweave we reviewed last year, the Takumi 2.0 model released in late 2024 is a half-inch thicker, costs a thousand dollars more, and contains an extra layer of fiber blocks. One is a base layer, while the other layer can be reversed to customize the firmness at your shoulders, midsection, and legs. There are five possible configurations, but the one recommended for my “generous” frame offers more support under the arch of my back, while my shoulders and legs are allowed to sink down more.The bed felt at first uncomfortably firm, and then I slept 10 straight hours and awoke refreshed. I’m a back sleeper by preference, and so the aggressive support offered by the Airweave has been helpful in keeping my spine in proper alignment. This is also ideal for stomach sleepers needing firm lumbar support, too. There’s also precious little motion transfer from one side of the bed to the other. But side sleepers might find this mattress too firm to be comfortable over the long haul.I should note that shipping and assembly are like no other mattress you’re likely to encounter. My Airweave was dropped off as freight, split out into three gigantic boxes strapped to a pallet. I then had to construct the Airweave myself, brick-and-mortar style, layering the Airfiber blocks and pads into a zippable mattress cover. Sure, I could have asked for white-glove service, and someone would have shown up to assemble it all for me. But the time spent messing around with the Airweave’s innards actually helped me appreciate the Takumi a little bit more. —Matthew KorfhageAirweave Takumi 2.0 ranges from $3,995 for a twin XL mattress to $6,695 for a California king.Mattress typePolyethyleneMaterialsTemperature regulating cover, inner cover, Airfiber blocks, polyethyleneCertificationsN/ASizes availableTwin XL, queen, king, California kingFirmness optionsSoft, medium soft, medium, medium firm, firm, extra firmAdd-ons availableN/AShipping costsFree for customers in the contiguous USDelivery optionsArrives in a box as part of standard shipping; white-glove delivery available for $275Trial period60 nights; 14-day day break-in period required before initiating returnWarranty10-year limitedWIRED/TIREDAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWIREDWith the Airfiber blocks, you can customize exactly how you want your mattress to feel.Easier to move between homes since it disassembles.Setting it up as firm delivers excellent support.TIREDThe initial delivery package is massive and comes by freight.Very expensive.Best Cooling MattressPhotograph: Molly HigginsCourtesy of BedgearChevronChevronBedgearH Performance Mattress$1,699 Amazon (H4)$1,799 BedgearEvery Bedgear mattress I’ve tested is extremely cooling and comfy, and it comes at a very fair price for the quality. This H Performance Mattress is no different. Like the others, it’s literally cool to the touch with the swirly-design silky Ver-Tex Top Cover that wicks away moisture and regulates temperature. (There are two choices for the H Performance mattress; the H4 is medium-firm, and the H6 is medium-plush). The sides are made from Air-X Side Panels that are netlike, which further aids air circulation. This hybrid mattress uses pocketed coil support at the bottom and multiple layers of memory-like foam up top. The bed is constructed with adaptive gel foam and high-density memory foam, which are super comfy and aid in pressure relief.This cooling bed-in-a-box offers free shipping to the lower 48, and if purchased through Bedgear’s website, it's covered by a 10-year warranty. You can also choose this mattress in medium-firm, or medium-plush. This cooling mattress is the most consistently cooling bed I’ve tested and feels more expensive than its price tag.

The bottom half starts with a 1-inch layer of high-density plush support foam followed by 8 inches of individually wrapped coils to help with structure, support, and low-motion transfer. The very bottom has a thin 1-inch layer to ensure more bottom support, and this US-made bed has a 101-night trial and a lifetime warranty.I absolutely love this medium-firm bed, and it feels much more expensive than it is. The individually wrapped coils give great structural support, while the top gel foams help with the cooling effect and pressure relief. For firmness, this bed feels like a true medium and had enough give to be comfortable for a side sleeper like me.

Here are a few more products that are still available which we liked but didn't love as much as the ones above.The Saatva Contour5 for $2,999: The Contour5 is a new offering from Saatva, replacing the popular Loom & Leaf in the company's lineup. Like other Saatva mattresses, but unlike most others on this list, it is not roll-packed and comes delivered on a moving truck. The Contour5 has two firmness options and updated cooling tech that uses airflow channels in its gel foam layer, which is thinner than its predecessor, meaning it retains less heat. In my two weeks of testing, I found the Contour 5 was very good at remaining cool through summer nights, which is extra impressive given that it uses very dense 5-pound-weight memory foam. The Contour5 is soft enough for side sleeping without feeling like a saggy hammock and has excellent build quality, which is impressive for an all-foam mattress without springs. I prefer a hybrid with microcoils, but Saatva is popular for a reason, and as all-foam mattresses go, it has a true luxury feel. —Martin Cizmar. $1,899 to $3,599The Big Fig Classic for $1,899: The Big Fig is designed for larger body frames. Being a bit overweight myself, I was eager to see how well this mattress, which is advertised as comfortably handling 550 pounds per sleeper, performed. It is a well-built mattress with an effective gel cooling layer; however, the aggressive edge support created a hammock-like feel despite the sturdy springs and three layers of high-density foam in the middle of the mattress. This was true both on my back and on my side. Others may appreciate the effect of sinking a bit into the center of the bed more than I do. —Martin Cizmar. $1,499 to $2,699The Boring Hybrid Mattress for $799: Boring Mattress is a new company founded by two alums from Tuft & Needle. Simplicity is the company's selling point. There is just one option: the Boring Hybrid Mattress. (You are allowed to pick a size.) This 10-inch hybrid has four layers of both foam and springs. I’m very sensitive to joint pain, and certain beds tend to make it worse, which is why pressure relief is super important for me. Having slept on a variety of different mattresses throughout the years, I was doubtful that this one would work. But I’ve slept on the hybrid mattress for months now and have yet to feel any pain at all. It strikes an excellent balance between firmness and support that my very particular self hasn’t been able to find with other options on the market. It’s worth noting, however, that its layers come equipped with an open-cell design that’s designed to move heat from your body while sleeping. I’m usually cold, so this feature isn’t that important to me. But on nights when I’ve cranked the heat up in my room and woken up sweating a bit, I can’t say it worked all that well for me. This isn’t a deal breaker, but I wouldn’t buy it solely for that. —Brenda Stolyar. $599 to $999Casper The One for $799: Casper was a leader in the first wave of bed-in-a-box makers in 2014. The company has changed ownership and design a few times over the past decade but last year's launch of The One finds the company keeping pace with competitors. This is an all-foam mattress that stands 11 inches tall. Because it's all foam, it’s on the light side, with a queen weighing an easily movable 66 pounds. One of the main issues with all-foam beds is that they get too hot, but Casper’s The One uses an open-cell foam layer called Breathe Flex Foam on the top, which makes it both pleasantly squishy and breathable. Two more layers of foam add up to a medium-firm feel, with the middle layer designed to cradle your hips, and the base layer designed to provide support. —Martin Cizmar. $749 to $1,698The Winkbed for $1,499: WIRED reviewer Julian Chokkattu slept on the luxury firm version of the WinkBed for almost two years and he was quite happy in that time. His favorite perk? The edge support is fantastic, so his partner never wakes when he slips into bed late at night. The plush pillowtop also adds a luxe, hotel-like feel to a relatively firm bed. —Martin Cizmar. $1,149 to $2,049S&S Organic for $1,000: I wouldn't expect this to feel silky-soft, but the latex is something even more supportive for sleep. I love how responsive (read: bouncy) this bed is, especially as someone who tosses and turns often. It's able to move with me so I never feel unsupported, or overheated for that matter. Latex and coils are breathable, as are the organic cotton cover and wool fire barrier are. —Julia Forbes. $800 to $1,300Nest Bedding Quail for $1,299: When it comes to all-foam mattresses from classic bed-in-a-box brands, I prefer the Casper above, but the Quail by Nest is a nice option if you want an all-foam bed that's a little firmer and you're willing to pay a little more. My biggest issue with the Nest was that despite its claimed cooling system—the foam is infused with minerals and designed with an airflow layer—I did sleep a little hot on it during my week of testing. —Martin Cizmar. $849 to $1,499Courtesy of Helix SleepHelix Sunset Elite for $3,748: Our top pick, Helix, also has an Elite collection that consists of seven mattresses along a spectrum of softness. At 16 inches high, this is "the tallest mattress on the internet," and comes shipped in two separate boxes, each heavy enough to max out FedEx requirements. The firmness is dictated by the foam density of the upper layer, which zips into a larger support system. This makes the mattress adjustable if you end up regretting your order. The bottom section has two separate layers of microcoils. I spent a month sleeping on the softest model from the Elite line, dubbed the Sunset, and appreciated the deep cradling effect. Helix offers a 100-day trial period on all of its mattresses. —Martin Cizmar. $2,499 to $4,499DreamCloud Hybrid for $1,698: Don't be turned off by that price just yet. This is one mattress that my husband begged me to keep, because the support and pressure relief set the bar so high. It's been one of the most consistently performing mattresses I've tested over the years. And that seemingly high price? DreamCloud runs sales often, so expect to slash that in half. —Julia Forbes. $1,148 to $2,562Wayfair Sleep 14-Inch Plush Cooling Gel Hybrid Mattress for $410: This plush mattress has a top layer of cooling gel that conforms to your body for comfort and has classic pocket coils below for structure and support, with layers of memory foams with varying thickness surrounding the coils for extra support (the coils and memory foam mixture helps with low motion transfer, too). The top knit cover and sides help with breathability and the overall cooling effect. The mattress is also compatible with an adjustable bed base, has solid edge support, is CertiPUR-US and Oeko-Tex Certified (ensuring no harmful toxins), and has a 10-year warranty. This bed is super comfy if you like a more plush mattress. —Molly Higgins. $400 to $700Mattresses to AvoidThere are some models you should avoid. Many of these beds are extremely affordable, and if you aren't picky, they may feel fine. In other cases, the mattress is decent but the price is not.Tempur-Pedic Tempur-Adapt for $2,199: Tempur-Pedic is one of the country's best-known and loved mattress brands, but two separate WIRED reviewers (Martin Cizmar and Nena Farrell) have both disliked different mattresses from the company over the past two years. Nena found the Tempur-Adapt totally lacking in support, and felt like she was sinking into a void when she lay on it. Her spine and muscles both ached after sleeping on it so she gave it to her sister who also hated it, describing it as like sleeping on a leaky air mattress. —Martin Cizmar. $1,699 to $3,398Magniflex Magnistretch 12 for $4,399: This mattress is Italian-made and advertises itself as stretching the spine. It’s endorsed by retired Italian soccer player Giorgio Chiellini and current pro basketballer Stefano Tonut, who plays for the Italian equivalent of the Boston Celtics. Well, the Magniflex definitely does something to the spine, though I found it very unwelcome. (It's worth noting that I am not the same Martin Cizmar who played a little pro soccer in Slovakia.) I lasted only two nights on the Magnistretch before crying uncle and limping over to my next tester. The morning-after sensation was as if I'd slept on a hammock made of chainlink fence, and my lower back was left feeling weak and creaky—very possibly it was stretched, and if so, it turns out I don't like having my back stretched. —Martin Cizmar. $3,699 to $5,299Sleep Number Climate360 Smart Bed for $10,249: This bed can be temperature-controlled, which is amazing. The adjustable base means you can be comfortable when watching TV, reading, or sleeping. Unfortunately, the price tag has too many digits, and sleep experts recommend avoiding electronic usage before bed—advice the Sleep IQ app defies. Did we mention it costs as much as a used Buick and the weight is not far behind? —Martin Cizmar. $10,249 to $14,449Amazon Basics mattress for $170 (Twin): This one is made of cheap foam that isn't dense enough, causing too much sinkage. —Martin Cizmar. $170 to $436Parachute Eco Comfort Mattress for $2,650: This mattress just doesn't live up to its extravagant price. The model we tested didn't have enough proper padding above its coils. —Martin Cizmar. $1,550 to $2,850Frequently Asked QuestionsHow We Test MattressesAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWIRED has tested mattresses since 2019. The very first version of our buying guide was made by sourcing two dozen beds and having our staff lay on them in a conference room to pick a favorite. But anyone who has bought a few beds in person from a mattress store can tell you the mattress you prefer when lounging in a well-lit store at 4 pm may not be the mattress you want while trying to get a few last winks at 4 am. We subsequently learned that there is no substitute for actually sleeping on tester mattresses in our own homes.We don't rely on surveys of random shoppers or labs with falling bowling balls to make our recommendations. We bring each bed into our homes for at least seven nights of real-life testing. Only after a week of good, restful sleep—as our lead reviewer I have personally tested 40-plus beds in the past two years—will we recommend a product. Everything we test gets at least a few nights to make a positive impression, but when we decide we hate a product we will stop short of testing it for seven nights and get ourselves some better sleep.How Firm or Soft Should Your Mattress Be?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronThe biggest decision in every mattress purchase is how firm to go. Generally, heavier people and back sleepers or stomach sleepers will do better with firmer beds, while lighter people and side sleepers enjoy softer. Temperature is also an issue: Softer mattresses sleep warmer since your body is sinking into a layer of fabric and foam. Keep in mind that all mattresses have a break-in period, and the way the mattress feels on your first night won't be how it feels after a week or two. It's also worth considering that if you buy a firmer mattress and want to soften it up, a mattress topper is a great option—we've got a full guide to the best—but it's much harder to make a soft mattress firmer.Should You Wait for a Sale?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronMattresses go on sale often—Presidents’ Day has somehow become the biggest sale day of the year, as famously mentioned on Nate Bargatze's Saturday Night Live skit. Labor Day and Memorial Day also somehow become mattress sale holidays. Additionally, online mattresses are often advertised as being on sale perennially. There's a strong chance you can save hundreds of dollars by waiting for the next big sale event. WIRED covers all of these sales and carefully tracks prices throughout the year so we can alert you to the best actual deals as opposed to “sales” that are not much different than the normal asking price.Can You Set Up a Bed-in-a-Box by Yourself?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronTake it from someone who has dealt with dozens over the past year: Bed-in-a-box mattresses delivered by FedEx are relatively easy to deal with. Most of these mattresses are delivered vacuum-sealed and rolled up. Some are pretty heavy—up to 150 pounds—and if you're ordering one of those, be sure someone is there to help you. After you unroll your bed-in-a-box mattress and cut the vacuum bag open, it'll immediately begin to inflate, so unbox it on your bed frame or near it. We have a helpful guide on how to set up the mattress you bought online with more tips. The mattresses are usually ready to go in a few hours, but most manufacturers recommend giving them two days to reach their normal state.What if You Don't Like the Mattress You Bought Online?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronMost of the picks we've tested and recommend have at least a 100-night testing period and a 10-year warranty. Before you buy, be sure to look at the company's policy as you may be on the hook for a nominal return fee. Set yourself a reminder a few days before the return deadline to make a final assessment.Should You Buy a Hybrid or an All-Foam?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronOld school mattresses were made of springs with thin layers of foam and cloth and usually sat on a box spring. Bed-in-a-box mattresses, on the other hand, are either foam or hybrids that layer foam with built-in springs. (I have never tested one that required a box spring.) We tend to recommend hybrids because they are more stable and supportive, and they usually stay cooler because the springs leave room for airflow. Hybrids are often slightly pricier. Foam mattresses tend to be softer, lighter, and cheaper.What Size Mattress Should You Buy?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronThe prices in our guide are based on the queen size, which is the most popular size in the US. But everything we've included comes in various standard sizes, usually standard twin, twin XL, full, queen, king, and California king. You'll want to buy based on the size of your bed frame.Are Online Mattresses Safe?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronMattresses sold in the US are subject to consumer protection rules on things like flammability and have requirements for tags that show when and where they were made (you remember the verbiage that says you can't remove tags under penalty of law, which has inspired generations of comedians). Any mattress you buy online should be safe, but it's always better to do business with reputable companies.How does WIRED acquire the mattresses to test?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronThere are a couple of ways we get mattresses into our testing queue. Often brands reach out to introduce themselves. Sometimes we see a mattress has been given a great review by a competitor and we want to test for ourselves. All of the beds on the current vesion of this story were provided as free samples by each of the brands you see here, with the exception of Wayfair and Amazon Basics which WIRED purchased.What does WIRED do with the mattresses after testing them?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWIRED's Reviews team is always testing new mattresses, cycling through about 50 in a year. We recently hired a dedicated sleep writer, Julia Forbes, to help keep pace with testing needs.
The majority of beds are considered “samples” and are sent to us for free by companies hoping to be given a good review. We don't keep them though. We are happy to send them back. Mattress companies cannot resell used mattresses and shipping is expensive, so this is rarely the path them choose. Once testing is through and all data has been recorded, our team passes them on to the community without getting any personal benefit. Commerce director Martin Cizmar has given away dozens of mattresses on Facebook Mareketplace—if you're in Kansas City and need a free lightly used mattress keep your eyes peeled.We also purchase (and expense) some mattresses we want to test. We won't say we like something we don't based on the commission rate.What should you look for when buying a mattress?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronThis may seem like a vague question, but it's actually requiring you to do some introspection. You'll need to honestly ask yourself about your body type, sleeping position(s) of choice, the materials you want, and other checklist items. From there, this will help you hone in on the bed that best fits you—with expert advice from our team along the way, of course.What are mattress certifications?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWe actually have a whole article outlining the various certifications associated with different mattress materials. In a nutshell though, these are the baseline qualifications ensured by a third-party evaluation so that there is no sway. Qualifications ensure things like memory foam don't contain chemicals that could harm you, or that questionable substances aren't present in a finished mattress.Power up with unlimited access to WIRED.
