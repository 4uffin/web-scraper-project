So why do I already see a few micro scratches on my iPhone Air and iPhone 17? Glass is glass, folks. So be smart. The best iPhone 17 cases and screen protectors can work together to keep your phone in pristine condition for as long as possible, aka when you decide to sell your iPhone to buy a new one.I have tested more than 50 cases and screen protectors to find the very best. Whether you have an iPhone 17 Pro Max or iPhone Air, we've got something for you. I'm also getting more and more cases and accessories by the week, so look out for fresh additions soon. Don't see something you're eyeing? Leave a comment and I'll check it out.Be sure to read our other Apple guides, including the Best Apple 3-in-1 Chargers, Best MagSafe Wallets, Best MagSafe Accessories, Best MagSafe Grips, and Best MagSafe Power Banks.Your Old Case Won’t FitAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronSometimes, the new iPhones have the same dimensions as the old iPhones, meaning you can reuse a case. That's sadly not the case with the iPhone 17 lineup. Things are different enough on every model that older iPhone cases will not fit. Don't just throw out your old case though. If it's in decent condition, you could donate it to a place like Goodwill, or look for accessory companies that have recycling centers, like Casetify or PopSockets. Your carrier or local Best Buy and Staples may even be able to help.What Is the Camera Plateau and Camera Control?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronYou'll see me mention these two words throughout this guide. They're fairly new additions to the iPhone.Camera Plateau is Apple's ridiculous name for the camera module on the new iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max. The entire top quarter of the phone rises, like a plateau, delivering a distinctive design that's different from any iPhone that came before.Camera Control is a new button that was introduced in the iPhone 16 models. It sits below the power button and lets you press it once to open the camera, and press it again to take a picture. A long-press captures video. Outside of the camera app, a long-press can trigger Apple's Visual Intelligence feature, which is kind of like Google Lens. Camera Control is more important in the context of cases, because many case makers use a cutout to leave a gap for this button instead of layering a button embedded in the case. This is because you can slide your finger over Camera Control to change camera modes. However, some manufacturers are using glass buttons and other tricks to get rid of the cutout and offer a much more symmetrical design.Make Sure You Buy a MagSafe Case!AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronAll of the cases we recommend in this guide have MagSafe unless otherwise noted. A MagSafe case will have a ring of magnets inside to make sure magnetic accessories stay attached. Otherwise, the case will just weaken the magnets. You should absolutely explore the world of MagSafe because there are so many kinds of accessories to play around with. Check our our guides:Best MagSafe AccessoriesBest MagSafe WalletsBest MagSafe GripsBest MagSafe Power BanksBest Apple 3-in-1 ChargersWhat Size iPhone Do You Have?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronIf you're unsure what model iPhone you have, you can head to Settings > General > About Phone and look at Model Number. Some case makers will identify case models by screen size, so here's a handy guide.The iPhone 17 has a 6.3-inch screenThe iPhone Air has a 6.5-inch screenThe iPhone 17 Pro has a 6.3-inch screenThe iPhone 17 Pro Max has a 6.9-inch screenJust because the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Pro share the same screen size, doesn't mean you can mix cases between them. Their dimensions are different, and so are the designs.How We Test CasesAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronI unfortunately cannot do drop tests with the limited number of iPhones I have. However, I install every case that comes my way onto the latest iPhones, inspect the cutouts for the speakers and microphones, make sure the buttons are responsive, and analyze the edges around the screen and cameras to see how raised they are. I also test them with MagSafe accessories to ensure the magnetic connection is strong.For screen protectors, I install each of them per the manufacturer's instructions and tools, and note how easy the process is.Best Case OverallPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuMousLimitless Phone Case$75 Amazon$70 MousMous makes some of my favorite cases, and the Limitless series is great because you can choose from various designs, from a wood back to speckled fabric. I tried the Marine, which has a lovely, soft fabric-like texture on the back. The thermoplastic polyurethane bumper is rigid and nicely raised to protect the screen and cameras, and I especially love that the Camera Control button isn't a cutout, but a real button embedded in the case. It makes the case more symmetrical. MagSafe works excellently, and the buttons are snappy. It's flawless.Best Clear CasePhotograph: Julian ChokkattudbrandGhost Case 2.0$60 $50 (17% off) Dbrand (Air)$60 $50 (17% off) Dbrand (Pro)$60 $50 (17% off) Dbrand (Max)$50 Best BuyDbrand company promises its Ghost 2.0 case won't yellow over time, and if it does, you'll get your money back. You can see your iPhone's color through the clear back, but the edges are wrapped in a thicker material to absorb shocks. It has a ribbed design for better grip, and the textured buttons are very clicky. I've also found Dbrand's magnets to be a little stronger than those in most other cases.The only problem? There's no Ghost 2.0 case for the iPhone 17. If you're in that camp, I recommend BodyGuardz's Accent Clear Case. It has a Camera Control button, works with MagSafe, and it comes with a wrist strap.Best Ultra-Thin CasePhotograph: Julian ChokkattuPitakaUltra-Slim Case$60 Amazon (17)$50 Amazon (Air)$60 Amazon (Pro)$60 Amazon (Max)Want the thinnest case possible for some kind of protection? Pitaka makes my favorite aramid fiber cases—it's just 0.99 mm thick for the iPhone Air, and around 1.01 mm for the other models. Unlike other ultra-slim cases, this one actually has a button cover for Camera Control, which I prefer over a cutout (the iPhone Air still has a cutout). There's good protection for the cameras, but the edges barely go past the display, so you should absolutely pair it with a screen protector. It might seem impossible considering how thin it is, but there are magnets in the case, and they allow MagSafe to work perfectly.Best Screen ProtectorPhotograph: Julian ChokkattudbrandPrism 2.0 Screen Protector$35 Dbrand (17)$35 Dbrand (Air)$35 Dbrand (Pro)$35 Dbrand (Max)Dbrand includes two tempered glass screen protectors in the box, along with cleaning supplies to wipe down your phone. Its application tool is very easy to use (it's a pull-tab system). It goes further toward the edge than most of the screen protectors I've tested, and doesn't feel sharp at the edges. It looks great, feels great, and you get two in the box, which is a pretty good value.My Favorite Protective CasePhotograph: Julian ChokkattuNomadRugged Case$49 Amazon (Pro)$49 Nomad (Pro)$49 Nomad (Max)Rugged cases are on a spectrum. You can get something that is god-awful ugly but covers your phone so well that it could survive a drop from a balcony. Or you can get something that still looks nice and feels great to use, but offers more protection than your average case. That's what the Rugged Case is from Nomad. Its 15-foot drop protection is more than what most cases offer, but it isn't the absolute highest rating I've seen. (Also, drop ratings are arbitrary.) I usually opt for OtterBox's Defender series cases for the best protection, but I had issues with its iPhone 17 case this year (see further below).Nomad is here to fill the gap. I love the matte PET backplate, which does a remarkable job of hiding fingerprint smudges (unlike Nomad's Modern Case). Around the case is a thick thermoplastic urethane bumper that slopes inward nicely, offering a comfortable grip. There's a glass Camera Control button, too, adding symmetry, and all of the anodized aluminum buttons are very responsive. MagSafe works reliably, and there are raised edges around the cameras and screen. The only downside? It's only available for the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max. At least the orange color will match!Best Kickstand CasePhotograph: Julian ChokkattuZaggSedona Snap Case With Kickstand$55 Amazon$55 ZaggI have tested Zagg's entire lineup of iPhone 17 cases, and the Sedona is my favorite. The kickstand is the highlight, though Zagg has the same kickstand on several of its cases. It can prop your iPhone up in landscape or portrait orientation, and it feels really sturdy. I like that it's at the bottom and flush, so it doesn't interfere with MagSafe or wireless charging.The case is also well-rounded. It's not the most svelte thing, but it's not bulky, with a thick bumper that's decently grippy, and raised edges that keep the cameras and display off the ground. The buttons are responsive, and Camera Control is an actual button on the case instead of a cutout. It makes the case look more symmetrical, and I find it easier to use. There are a few colors on Amazon, but Zagg has even more options if you buy direct.Best Cheap Screen Protector (With Privacy, Too!)Photograph: Julian ChokkattuSmartishTuff Sheet Screen Protector (Privacy and Standard)$25 $20 (20% off) Amazon (Standard)$30 Amazon (Privacy)Smartish has a similarly excellent application tool as Dbrand that makes installing its Tuff Sheet (heh) screen protector a breeze. You also get a nice kit to clean your phone before installation, like a microfiber cloth, wet wipe, and dust removal stickers. It took me seconds to apply the tempered glass, and I only had one air bubble that I was able to push out quickly. The edges are curved, so it doesn't feel sharp as your finger glides from the edge of the phone to the screen. Did I mention it's a two-pack? For $20?I also tried Smartish's Privacy screen protector, which has the same installation process. It's a two-way privacy screen, meaning people to the left and right of you won't be able to see what's on your screen. However, it doesn't block someone in front of you from staring down and reading your display upside down. Still, the quality of the protector is great; the text on my screen looks very sharp.A Bumper for the iPhone AirPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuAppleiPhone Air Bumper$39 $37 (5% off) Amazon$39 AppleIt does feel dumb to buy the super-thin and lightweight iPhone Air, and then ruin it with a bulky case. Apple thought the same, so it made a bumper instead! This comes with the usual caveat that this isn't going to be the best protection for the iPhone Air. But if you're too scared of going case-less for this $999 phone, it at least offers a little peace of mind.The Air still feels very thin and lightweight, and if anything, the bumper gives you a bit more edge to comfortably grab onto. The buttons are responsive, including Camera Control, and the bottom of the bumper includes connection points for attaching a lanyard or crossbody strap.Best Leather CasesPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuNomadModern, Traditional, and Rugged Leather Cases$55 Nomad (Modern)$85 Nomad (Traditional)$75 Nomad (Rugged)$55 AmazonNomad's leather cases look and feel great, and they're paired with a well-built polycarbonate frame that doesn't feel like an afterthought. There are three main case types to choose from: Modern, Traditional, and Rugged. All of them have clicky buttons, a dedicated glass button for the Camera Control instead of a cutout, and MagSafe.The Modern Leather Case is my favorite of the bunch. It employs vegetable-tanned Horween leather, but there's a polycarbonate frame that offers extra protection around the sides of the iPhone.The Traditional Leather Case is great if you want a pure leather case. There's no polycarbonate frame, so it won't be as protective, but the edges around the camera module and screen are slightly more raised, and it features the same anodized aluminum buttons.The Rugged Leather Case is like the Modern case, but more protective. It has a polycarbonate frame and also adds thermoplastic urethane bumpers at the corners for extra impact protection. The edges are raised even more here to keep the glass away from surfaces.Want a vegan leather option? I like Moft's Snap Case ($50), which feels very much like leather minus the scent. It checks off all the boxes, from clicky buttons to raised edges around the screen.Best Leather Case for iPhone AirPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuMujjoLeather Case$49 Amazon (Air)$49 Amazon (17)$59 Amazon (Pro)$59 Amazon (Max)Case makers may offer the same case type for the entire iPhone 17 lineup, but the versions for the iPhone Air have small discrepancies to accommodate the super-thin design. I tried a handful of leather cases for the Air, and this one from Mujjo is my favorite. It offers more protection than most others, with the only exposed parts being the Camera Control button and a little bit of the bottom edge.The Velore leather is made from fine-grain Danish calfskin that isn't as smooth as other leather finishes, but has a nice texture. The camera is well-protected, and there's a solid display guard with raised edges. It's a shame the buttons are a little stiff. It's available for the entire iPhone lineup, but I prefer Nomad's leather cases for all the other models (see above).The Grippiest CasePhotograph: Julian ChokkattudbrandGrip Case$60 Dbrand (17)$60 Dbrand (Air)$60 Dbrand (Pro)$60 Dbrand (Max)Got butterfingers? If your phone is frequently slipping out of your hand, you need Dbrand's Grip case. True to its name, it's one of the grippiest cases I've used thanks to microscopic ridges all across the edges of the phone. I frequently shake phones in my hand as I test cases (don't picture it), and Dbrand's Grip is just about the only one that doesn't shift at all. You can choose a colorful (or even glow-in-the-dark!) skin for the back of the phone to make it look unique.It's the attention to detail that makes this case so great. The magnets are strong, there's a capacitive-touch Camera Control button, the rest of the textured buttons are clicky, and there's great protection over the screen and cameras. This year's design for the Pro models has a bump to accommodate the Camera Plateau. I'm not sure why Dbrand chose to ramp the case up to the camera module; it makes the skin look a little awkward.A Minimalist's Dream CasePhotograph: Julian ChokkattuArcPulse Case$70 Arc (17)$70 Arc (Air)$70 Arc (Pro)$70 Arc (Max)OK, the Arc Pulse is technically a bumper, not a case. It's for anyone who hates cases but wants some kind of protection. The aluminum bumpers slide easily over the edges of the phone and stay put. That's important because phones usually land on a corner or edge. However, while it's better than nothing for drop protection, there's always the possibility that your phone cracks at the first drop, especially if it lands on a rock. Since it doesn't cover other parts of the iPhone, don't expect it to keep the device scratch-free.The best part about the Arc Pulse is that your iPhone isn't any wider. You can still enjoy an edge-to-edge screen without your finger getting interrupted by a case. It comes in several finishes, like Matte Black and Silver, and Arc lets you select your iPhone's color so you can see what the Pulse will look like over your device. Use this tool because I asked for Gold, and I don't think it matches the Deep Blue iPhone 17 Pro all that much.Apple's Official CasesPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuAppleTechWoven Case$59 $56 (5% off) Amazon$59 AppleI have tried all of Apple's official cases this year: the Silicone case, the new TechWoven case, and the Clear case. I prefer the TechWoven out of them all. The Silicone case is fine, but it attracts way too much dust and lint for my taste. The Clear case is more perplexing. Does Apple know what clear means? Half of the case is blocked off in white on the Pro models to highlight the two-tone design, but that defeats the purpose of buying a beautiful orange and blue iPhone, because most of it is now covered up by this white shell. It's just not a truly clear case, though the models for the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Air do the job.The TechWoven, on the other hand, is a nice upgrade from the crappy FineWoven cases that aged poorly. It's made from 100 percent recycled polyester, with multiple colored yarns mixed together. I quite like the somewhat rough fabric-like texture, but it might not be for everyone. It's fairly grippy, offers raised edges over the display and the Camera Plateau, and has clicky buttons. This case also has connection points at the bottom so you can attach Apple's official Crossbody Strap (or third-party straps). I should note that if you wear particularly tight pants (oops), you may find an edge of the phone trying to poke out of the case.Best Wallet Folio CasePhotograph: Julian ChokkattuNomadModern Leather Folio$109 NomadNomad makes great leather cases, so it makes sense that I really like its leather folio, too. You can actually fit stuff here! There are three card slots, and it's easy to pull out a card from each. You can try to stuff an extra card or two, but things will get tight. There's also a sleeve on the side for a bit of cash. Nomad also includes a removable strap, if you want to keep the folio closed via a magnet. I like that you have the option. The case is otherwise similar to the Modern Leather Case, with a polycarbonate frame wrapped around the supple Horween leather. The folio wraps around nicely as well, allowing for easy one-handed use.Best Privacy Screen ProtectorPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuZagg4-Way Privacy XTR Screen Protector$60 Amazon$60 ZaggWant to stop anyone from looking over your shoulder and staring at your screen? You need a four-way privacy screen protector. Zagg's Privacy XTR was simple to install with a pull-tab system, and it also included the necessary tools to clean the screen. The result? The screen is much harder to read at an angle. The caveat is that the iPhone takes a hit on screen brightness—at max brightness, it was noticeably darker than another iPhone without a privacy protector. It may be hard to notice, but the screen also gets a tiny bit fuzzy. But if privacy is of utmost importance, and you can live with those compromises, this protector will do the job.A Ceramic Screen ProtectorPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuBodyGuardzApex Ceramic Glass$60 AmazonI usually find it hard to recommend screen protectors that cost this much, but it's not often you find one with ceramic glass. Apple already uses Ceramic Shield—ceramic mixed with glass—to protect the iPhone's screen. Why wouldn't you do the same with a screen protector? It's hard to say how much stronger it is than tempered glass, but this sheet feels exquisite to touch. It's delightfully smooth and clear, with soft edges that feel like the keys of a piano.The installation is the same pull-tab system many other brands are using, like Smartish and Dbrand, and honestly, you shouldn't settle for anything else. My alignment was perfect, and the few air bubbles that popped up disappeared with the included squeegee. Unfortunately, it only comes with one protector.Apple's Crossbody StrapPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuChevronChevronAppleCrossbody Strap$59 Amazon$59 AppleCan you find crossbody straps for cheaper? Absolutely. Do you want Apple's official crossbody strap? Duh. There are so many fun colors to choose from, and you can also color-match them with your iPhone. It's made from 100 percent recycled PET yarn, and the strap slides across your chest smoothly. Adjusting the strap is fairly easy with the stainless steel sliding mechanism. I have a 6'4" frame and was able to make it way too long for my body. (The max strap length is 82 inches.)It's best paired with Apple's official case as it has the connection points at the bottom, but you should be able to use it with cases that have lanyard holes.Other Screen Protectors I've TestedESR Armorite Pro screen protector.
Photograph: Julian ChokkattuESR Armorite Screen Protector and Privacy Protector for $20: This pack is better value than Smartish's screen protectors, because you get three tempered glass sheets instead of two. All the necessary equipment is here, from an application tool to wet wipes. While it uses a pull-tab, I found Smartish's and Dbrand's systems easier to use overall. I also tried ESR's Privacy Protector, which was effective at blocking the screen when viewed from the left or right. I didn't see a major impact on sharpness or color accuracy. I tested ESR's Armorite Pro ($36) with tempered glass made by Corning, the company that makes most of the glass found on smartphones. The edge feels a tiny bit sharp, but it was otherwise easy to apply and looks great.OtterBox Glass Screen Protector for $40: OtterBox is now using a pull-tab system for installation, and the process was very easy, though I did end up with more air bubbles than my top picks. It comes with a microfiber, wet wipe, and dust-removal stickers, but you only get one aluminosilicate screen protector.Nomad ProShield Glass for $39: Here's another aluminosilicate screen protector made by Corning, the company that makes the glass on most smartphones. Instead of a pull-tab, you put the phone in the application tool, then close the tool like a book and push down as glass sticks to glass. It worked surprisingly well, with just a few air bubbles. I still feel like the edges of the protector are a little sharper than I'd like, compared to the Dbrand and Smartish. It also only comes with one.Zagg XTR5 Screen Protector for $60: Zagg is really going after the blue-light crowd. If you think cutting as much blue light from your smartphone will help you sleep better or might be easier on the eyes, by all means, try the XTR5. It may give you peace of mind. But studies are still mixed on the efficacy of this, though Zagg claims this version specifically cuts out the wavelengths that impact sleep and eye comfort. The glass feels smooth and is thick. It annoyingly doesn't cover the entire screen, but the edges don't feel sharp. Installation was easy with the pull-tab system (a first for Zagg), and the company says this tempered glass is fortified with graphene for extra durability; it's hard to say just how much it helps. It's worth noting that I did notice an impact on color accuracy. Compared with another iPhone, the XTR5 delivered a cooler tone to the iPhone screen.Astropad Fresh Coat Anti-Reflective Screen Protector for $35: Apple already added an anti-reflective coating to all of the new iPhones, but this Astropad screen protector can take that even further. Installation was easy with the pull-tab application system, though I got far more air bubbles with it than with any of the other pull-tab installations. It actually does work and cuts glare. I compared it with another iPhone that didn't have a screen protector, and noticed glare was less pronounced with the Astropad. There's no real loss in color accuracy or sharpness. I compared photos on the two phones, and they looked virtually identical. I haven't found much reason to complain about glare on the iPhone 17 screen, but if something like that has bothered you before, the Fresh Coat might be up your alley.Rhinoshield Impact Protector Pro (Transparent) for $36: This flexible screen protector was easy to apply, though I am a bit miffed that Rhinoshield didn't include a wet wipe (just a microfiber and dust-removal stickers). It still left air bubbles, but the squeegee was able to get rid of them. The edges are a little sharp, which isn't a problem on my top picks. This isn't as much of an issue when paired with a case. The company claims it restricts blue light, but take this with a grain of salt. Studies have shown mixed results that cutting blue light from a smartphone will help you sleep better.UAG Glass Shield Screen Protector for $40: This tempered glass screen protector is available for the iPhone 17, iPhone Air, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max. But the application tool is a little too basic. It allows for some room for error, at least, more than my top picks, and it also gave me a lot of air bubbles. The glass is pretty thick, which feels protective, but you can also feel the sharp edges running along the side.Other Great CasesI've tested more than 50 cases for the iPhone 17 lineup. Not all of them deserve a top spot above, but many are still great and come in fun designs and styles. Check 'em out.Alto Wood Case.
Photograph: Julian ChokkattuAlto Wood Case for $41: I love a good wood case, but I have some mixed feelings about these cases from Alto. You can get custom laser-carved prints, like from its Wildlife or Flora series; you can even add your own image. But these look a little tacky to me. Why hide that gorgeous wood? You can choose from a range of wood styles, from olive wood to cherry. I'd probably grab something from the company's Burl & Exotic Series. The case itself is OK. The rubber bumper around the edges is grippy, but feels a little cheap. The power button is solid, and there's a cutout for the Camera Control button, but the volume rocker feels a tiny bit mushy.Beats Rugged Case for $79: This case is the opposite of the Beats Kickstand case that I listed in the avoid section below. Where that case was super slippery, this one offers a much better grip. The buttons are clicky, the display and cameras are protected, and it looks very pretty. It's not the grippiest case I've tried, nor is it the most rugged, despite its name. I prefer the Camera Control button design on the Nomad Rugged Case, which has a thicker bumper. It's available for the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max.BodyGuardz Performance Pro and Pulse Cases for $50+: BodyGuardz's Pulse case is a fine case that comes in a fun matcha color and includes a wrist strap. The Camera Control button is nicely elevated. Look along the side edges and you'll see vents—this is to help disperse heat, along with the help of cooling gel on the inner lining. I've tried testing this in the past and haven't noticed much of a difference in gaming performance on the phone. The directional speaker is something that does actually work. Basically, the case directs the audio from the rear speakers towards you instead of downward, and you can marginally hear the difference. The Performance Pro takes it to the max with larger vents, and it adds a kickstand. I just don't like how the case feels when you hold it.Burton Goods Heritage Leather Case.
Photograph: Julian ChokkattuBurton Goods Heritage Leather Case for $79+: Burton Goods is from the creator of Pad & Quill, which shut down in 2023 due to bankruptcy. The company was known for its classy leather cases, and that has continued with the new brand. The Heritage will make you feel like you're sitting on a cozy armchair near a fireplace in an old English study. The full-grain leather feels supple (and smells great), and the stitching gives it even more character. There's MagSafe baked in, a microfiber interior, and all the buttons are responsive. The edges are raised well around the display and Camera Plateau, too. You can pair it with the Heritage MagSafe Wallet Stand, which is a magnetic wallet with a kickstand. I was able to fit about three credit cards, though the top cover flap makes it a little hard to remove the cards.Rhinoshield SolidX and Clear Cases for $38+: I have no qualms with either of these Rhinoshield cases. The SolidX is robust, thick, and protective, with clicky buttons and MagSafe. The Clear case has extremely clicky buttons that stick out quite a bit, and it feels very sturdy. There's just not much else to them, other than the fact that the company uses a proprietary material called Mono. It's 100 percent recycled and is essentially a single compound, making recyclability easier.OtterBox Symmetry Series cases.
Photograph: Julian ChokkattuOtterBox Symmetry Series Case for $60: OtterBox's Symmetry series is its most fun lineup because there are usually several nifty designs to choose from. Case in point, look at this adorable cactus embroidered case! It's a fun texture to have on the back of your phone, and it's super cute. This version is actually made from cactus leather, but other Symmetry cases are standard plastic. I don't think the basic Symmetry cases are worth the $60 price, but the embroidered versions are worth considering. While these have MagSafe baked in, the embroidery does weaken the magnetic connection. It still charged my iPhone, but I wouldn't trust it on a MagSafe car dock.OtterBox Commuter Series Case for $50: OtterBox's Commuter case is simple and inoffensive. You have a few muted colors to choose from, and the dual-layer design has a rubber slipcover surrounded by a harder plastic shell. I like the rubber edges as they help with grip, too. It checks off all the boxes—even the USB-C port is covered up—but it's just not very exciting.OtterBox Sole Series Case.
Photograph: Julian ChokkattuOtterBox Sole Series Case for $70: I actually really like the look and feel of this case. The ridged edges are grippy, and the netting-like fabric texture on the back is so satisfying to run my fingers over. It's kind of like sandpaper, but in a good way. The cameras and display are protected, and the buttons are clicky. However, I'm very confused by the included lanyard loop. It's way too tiny to put on even the smallest wrists. I suspect you're meant to affix it to a carabiner or backpack instead. If that's your jam, you'll like this. If not, the lanyard is removable, and you can buy another one designed for wrists.Mous Super Thin Aramid Fibre Case for $70: Several companies now make aramid fiber ultra-thin cases, and honestly, you can't go wrong with most of them. I prefer the subtle texture of Pitaka's case (see above), but Mous' Super Thin is a close second, and it even comes in a clear option with MagSafe. I very much like the raised protection for the camera, though the Camera Control button is exposed, and there's less protection on the top and bottom, unlike Pitaka's case. As always, this sturdy case is extremely thin and is not going to provide the best protection, especially for the screen, but it'll cover the usual wear and tear. Pair it with a screen protector.Thinborne Super Thin Aramid Fiber Case for $70: It's super thin like the Pitaka and Mous aramid fiber cases, with baked-in MagSafe, but I like Pitaka's designs better. All of the buttons are exposed here, including the Camera Control. Thinborne includes a screen protector, but you have to freehand the installation as it doesn't come with an application tool.Zagg Milan Snap case.
Zagg iPhone 17 Cases for $50+: I have tried all of Zagg's cases, and they're all solid, though I prefer the Sedona (see above) the most. Here are some thoughts on the lineup. The Crystal Palace Snap With Stand has the same great kickstand as the Sedona, as well as an actual button for Camera Control, but this case is clear. It's a great way to show off your iPhone's color, though it smudges easily. The Manhattan Snap ditches the kickstand and is silicone, but I found it attracts too much dust and lint; it is very soft, though. The Milan Snap has a fun iridescent color, and the Santa Cruz Snap With Stand has a striking, colorful bumper that's grippy, but the Camera Control button is a cutout. The Luxe Snap might be my favorite of the lot in terms of design, with a fun texture on the back and grooved edges, but there's no kickstand. Finally, the Rainier Case With Kickstand is the newest in Zagg's lineup, and if you want robust protection, this one will satisfy. It's a two-shell case with a hard and thick bumper, and seriously raised edges for maximum screen protection with extra-thick corners. Even the USB-C port is covered up. You get the same great kickstand, but the buttons are a bit mushy.ESR Clear, Soft, and Tough Magnetic Case for $30: ESR has three versions of this case, each in a different material. The Soft employs a soft-touch silicone, and it's quite nice, with clicky buttons and a dedicated Camera Control button. The Clear is, well, clear, and the Tough uses a hard plastic shell. None of them particularly excites me, but what makes them unique is the built-in kickstand that surrounds the camera module. It's a neat idea, but you can only prop these phones up in landscape orientation. Technically, you can put them upright in portrait mode, but the phone has to be upside down. Either way, the Zagg recommendation above is a much better kickstand case.Smartish cases.
Photograph: Julian ChokkattuSmartish Gripzilla, Gripmunk, and Wallet Slayer Vol. 2 Cases for $20+: These cases are nice and affordable. The Gripzilla has textured edges that make for a nice grip, though it's nowhere near as grippy as Dbrand's Grip case that I recommend above. The Gripmunk has some ridges to help with grip, and the Wallet Slayer Vol. 2 lets you stuff several credit cards on the back. However, the wallet interferes with MagSafe and has no magnets inside, so it cuts you off from wireless charging. It also makes the case very thick. They're all solid cases for the money, and you should shop directly from Smartish as it has some exclusive designs on its store.Matter HT Snap Cases for $60: Formerly known as Atom Studios, these “Snap” cases aren't actually cases. They're just a backing you can magnetically stick to your phone to protect the rear glass. The company offers them in a clear, wood fiber, or agave material. They all look nice and feel great, especially the Clear version for the iPhone Air. However, I don't see the point of these. They don't cover the edges at all, which is where you'll most likely see scuffs and scratches after a drop. I'd much rather go for an ultra-thin case that wraps the edges of a phone, or something like the Arc Pulse.UAG Pathfinder.
Photograph: Julian ChokkattuUAG Cases for $45+: I have tested the full suite of UAG's cases, from the Plyo and the Monarch Pro to the Metropolis LT and Plasma XTE. If I had to pick one, I'd buy the Pathfinder ($60). I love the bright yellow color, and the design is bold, but it works. It makes me feel tactical, like I'm about to scale and infiltrate a building. The problem with all of UAG's cases is that they're expensive, and none of them feature a dedicated button for Camera Control; it's all a cutout. (I've just come to really prefer having an actual button on the case!) I also like the UAG Dot ($45) and its fun translucent case.Avoid These CasesBeats Kickstand Case for $59: This case is available for the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max, but not the iPhone Air. I feel bad not recommending it because it's adorable, especially in pink, and the kickstand is super creative. Instead of embedding a kickstand into the case, the included lanyard has a pill-shaped kickstand that pops out. Place it on one of the longer edges of the iPhone, and voila, kickstand! The problem is that it doesn't work at all in portrait orientation, so it's limited as a kickstand case. Also, the polycarbonate case is shockingly slippery. I don't think I've ever used a case more slippery. I was so surprised I showed my wife, and she immediately said, “Yeah, no, I don't like that.” I guess that's why a lanyard is included.Mujjo Full Leather Wallet Case for $69: I like Mujjo's leather cases, but I don't really like the ones with a wallet sleeve embedded into the case itself. Firstly, the sleeve barely fits my card properly, let alone three, like the company claims. It's also really hard to take the cards out. While Mujjo has built-in magnets in the case, the magnetic connection is fairly weak because the sleeve interrupts it. Not to mention the fact that you have to remove your cards to actually use MagSafe. It just seems counterintuitive. Just get a MagSafe wallet at that point.OtterBox Defender Series Pro XT Case for $80: I'm so used to OtterBox's Defender series having solid colors that the clear design here threw me off. I don't hate it, but it does show smudges easily. While I usually choose this case as the most protective due to its dual-layer design (a polycarbonate frame sits on top and a rubber slipcover rests underneath), I ran into a problem. The Camera Control button is way too responsive. It's so easy to press that I kept launching the camera every time I picked up the iPhone. My grip alone would end up pushing the button. I have tried installing and reinstalling this case several times to make sure the fit was right, but the problem still keeps happening. Bah.Smartish Wallet Slayer Vol. 1 for $30: This is an odd case. The wallet sleeve on the back is really tight, and I had trouble stuffing two cards in. Taking them out isn't easy either because they get stuck on the edge. Smartish also advertises a kickstand, but there is no kickstand on the case. Instead, you're supposed to use your own credit card as the kickstand, which is just a little weird.UAG Trooper Case for $65: Cases are so good these days, which is why it irks me when there's an obvious flaw in a design. UAG's Trooper is a rugged, tough case that is very bulky. Yet instead of adding a button for Camera Control, the company kept a cutout. But when the edge is so thick, it's genuinely hard to press this button, even if the back edge is sloped in. (Could be my fat fingers.) The volume rocker and Action Button are also hard to press.CommentsBack to topTriangleJulian Chokkattu is a senior reviews editor at WIRED, and has been covering personal technology and reviewing consumer products for a decade.
