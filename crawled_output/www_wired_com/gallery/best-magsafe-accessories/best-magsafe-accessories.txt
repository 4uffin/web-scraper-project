Apple's built-in magnets make it easy to accessorize your phone with everything from tripods and camera cages to storage drives and wallets—and all of them easily pop into place with no tools needed. The WIRED Reviews team has tested hundreds of accessories and gadgets to find the MagSafe accessories worth slapping on your iPhone.Good news: Android phone owners can take part in the fun, too. Whether you have a native Qi2 device like the Google Pixel 10, a Qi2-Ready phone, or just a magnetic case, many of these MagSafe accessories will also work with your smartphone.Read our other MagSafe guides, including the Best MagSafe Power Banks, Best MagSafe Wallets, Best MagSafe Wireless Chargers, Best 3-in-1 Apple Chargers, Best iPhone 17 Cases, and Best Google Pixel 10 Cases.Updated September 2025: We’ve added the Twelve South Curve Nano, Benks ArmorPop Grip, Belkin UltraCharge, and SupCase MagFlip.Best MagSafe Portable ChargerPhotograph: Simon HillAnkerMagGo Power Bank (10K) (Qi2)$90 $70 (22% off) Amazon$90 $72 (20% off) Walmart$90 AnkerThe simplest and most practical accessory everyone should get is a MagSafe power bank. Gone are the days of needing to carry a cable around or fuss with a cable dangling out of your pockets as your power bank recharges your phone. Just slap these batteries on the back and let them do their thing.Anker's MagGo Power Bank has a 10,000-mAh battery capacity, which can recharge an iPhone completely almost twice. It supports the Qi2 standard, meaning it will also play well with Qi2 Android phones, in case you're in a mixed-device household. That also means it dishes out 15 watts for the fastest charging speeds possible on an iPhone. There's a built-in kickstand, always helpful, and an LED on the side to let you know how much juice is left before the battery needs to be topped up via USB-C.Read our Best MagSafe Power Banks guide for more.Best MagSafe ChargerPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuAppleMagSafe Charger (2 m)$49 $35 (29% off) Amazon$50 $35 (30% off) Best Buy$49 AppleMagSafe was designed to make wireless charging more efficient and faster. It's not going to recharge your smartphone as quickly as plugging in a cable, but you'll have more options to move the cable out of the way while charging, and you don't have to plug anything in (it's hard to be precise when you're fishing for a USB-C cable in the dark!). The built-in cable on these MagSafe chargers is also typically longer than the ones that come with your phone, making them easier to use while charging.There are so many to choose from, and while I originally disliked Apple's MagSafe Charger because it had a very short cable, the company revamped it. It now features a 2-meter cable (around 6.5 feet), so you don't have to hug the wall while charging. It's also Qi2-certified, meaning it'll work perfectly with iPhones and will be compatible with upcoming Qi2 Android phones.Read our Best MagSafe Wireless Chargers guide for more.A Great MagSafe WalletPhotograph: Brenda StolyarCourtesy of AmazonChevronChevronSmartishSide Hustle Wallet$28 Amazon$35 $30 (14% off) SmartishThis is one of the easiest MagSafe wallets to use. I could comfortably fit three cards inside. (If you have one of those fancy metal credit cards—look at you!—you can probably just fit two.) It's easy to push them out, thanks to the gap on the side, and I didn't have to take the wallet off the phone, which is often the case with MagSafe wallets that use a vertical sleeve. I vigorously shook the wallet, and my cards didn't fall out, even when I only had one in there. It comes in a few designs and is made from vegan leather (aka plastic).Read our Best MagSafe Wallets guide for more.A Trackable MagSafe WalletPhotograph: Molly HigginsCourtesy of NomadChevronChevronNomadLeather Mag Wallet$85 Nomad$80 VerizonThis luxe, super-thin leather MagSafe wallet snaps onto the back of your iPhone using MagSafe magnets, and it has Apple’s Find My feature built in, so you can easily find it when misplaced. The wallet design is simple and elegant, using vegetable-tanned Horween leather with a polycarbonate frame, and it can hold up to four cards. The wallet can be wirelessly recharged on any Qi or MagSafe charger, and once it's fully recharged, the battery lasts for five months. Although having Find My isn't the most necessary feature, it comes in handy for iPhone users who have a tendency to lose everything (me). This feature won't work with Android phones. —Molly HigginsA Little MagSafe NotepadPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuMoftSnap Flow$40 Amazon$75 MoftMoft's Snap Flow is exactly the kind of fun I'm looking for in a MagSafe accessory. It's a cute little notepad you can attach to the back of your phone to jot things down when inspiration strikes (or, you know, to keep that grocery list up to date). Sure, you can use Apple's Notes app for all of that, but that's boring. There's even a little pen tucked inside, and you can fold it up to make it thicker for comfier writing. You can get replacement notes from Moft, even refills for the pen, plus you can swap the notes for sticky notes to leave thought-provoking quotes around town.Best MagSafe Wireless Charging StandPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuNomadStand (MagSafe)$119 NomadSimple, stylish, and exceptionally well made with a mix of metal and glass, Nomad's Stand is one of our favorite wireless chargers, and it supports the fastest 15-watt speeds for iPhones. Just plop your iPhone on the magnetic puck and it will float on your desktop, in either landscape or portrait orientation. The stand doesn't slide around (it's quite hefty), and it comes with a lovely braided USB-C to USB-C cable, though you'll need to supply a 20-watt charger.Read our Best Wireless Chargers guide for more options.Best MagSafe 3-in-1 Wireless ChargerPhotograph: Simon HillBelkin3-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand$130 $110 (15% off) Amazon$110 Best Buy$130 Apple$110 BelkinI love this tree-like wireless charger. It saves so much space on my desk, and I can recharge my iPhone at the fastest 15-watt charging speed possible, along with an Apple Watch and AirPods. It's a must-have for anyone who has all three of those devices (or any earbuds with wireless charging support). Belkin also has a pad version that adds MagSafe support for AirPods, but it takes up more room, and I much prefer the floating aesthetic. It's like magic!Read our Best 3-in-1 Apple Chargers guide for more options.A Great Workstation CompanionPhotograph: Simon Hillohsnap!Desk Power Kit$130 $100 (23% off) OhSnap (Kit)$40 OhSnap (Stand)$50 OhSnap (Wireless Charger)$25 Best Buy (Snap 4 Grip)The Desk Power Kit has been great for topping up my phone at my desk throughout the workday. It's comprised of three components: the Snap Grip, Snap Stand, and Snap Charge. The stand has a ball mount that moves smoothly and allows you to adjust your phone at any angle. That lets me keep an eye on notifications, take FaceTime calls, or stream YouTube videos. The base of the stand has a nanosuction adhesive on the bottom, so it's sturdy and washable in case it gets dirty from moving it around to different locations. The Snap Charge is a wireless charging puck that magnetically attaches to the stand, transforming it into a charging dock. I like this because I can choose when to charge my phone, without losing the stand functionality. It supports Qi2, meaning more efficient and faster charging speeds, and it'll work with Qi2 Android phones.OhSnap! sells each of these separately, but the kit includes the company's Grip. You could just buy the stand and Snap Charge if you have another grip you like. That said, the grip is compatible with both the charger and stand, so you don't have to remove it every time you want to attach it to either one.A Face-Tracking MagSafe DockPhotograph: Brenda StolyarBelkinAuto-Tracking Stand Pro with DockKit$150 Amazon$150 Best BuyFrequently FaceTiming at the kitchen counter while cooking? Or maybe you're trying to make it big on TikTok and making videos at home? In either scenario, Belkin's Stand Pro can help (8/10, WIRED Recommends). It's one of the very few charging docks that work with Apple's DockKit framework, which enables the iPhone's native camera to track your face, and since the wireless charging stand sits above a 360-degree base, that means you can move around a room and the iPhone will always keep you in the frame. You pair your iPhone with it via NFC by tapping it on the base—no need to download an app—and it works with pretty much every camera and video calling app.You can keep it plugged in, but there's also a built-in battery if you want to take it from room to room. It's a bit bulky, though, so it's not super travel-friendly.A Versatile MagSafe MountPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuPeak DesignCreator Kit$50 Amazon$50 Peak Design$50 Amazon (Cases)I used this mount at the Apple event to put the iPhone on my full-size camera tripod. It came in clutch! This Creator Kit uses Peak Design's SlimLink mount system, which adds a more secure layer over MagSafe, but this does mean you'll need a Peak Design mobile case to take advantage. However, Creator Kit works with so many systems: GoPro mounts, 1/4-inch-20 mounts, Peak Design's very own Capture Clip, and Arca tripods. It's super easy to take the phone off the Creator Kit one-handed—push one of the buttons on the mount, and that's it.A MagSafe Battery Pack and Grip ComboPhotograph: Brenda StolyarPopSocketsMagSafe PowerPack$40 Amazon$40 Best Buy$40 PopsocketsOnce you start using a grip, holding your phone without one feels awkward. That's why I love this MagSafe PowerPack from PopSocket. It's both a portable battery and a grip in one. While it's attached to your phone, you can use the PopSocket on top to hold your phone comfortably. It's the best of both worlds!The battery has a 5,000-mAh capacity, so it can get your iPhone close to full once (less if you have a larger iPhone). It's not Qi2, so it only dishes out 7.5 watts on an iPhone, meaning it's slow to charge, but it gets the job done. It has an LED on the side of the battery to see how much power is left, and it recharges via USB-C. PopSocket offers several designs (I love this one from its Bookish collection).Read our Best MagSafe Power Banks guide for more.A Magsafe Grip, Stand, and MountPhotograph: Molly HigginsCourtesy of Ohsnap!ChevronChevronohsnap!Snap Grip 4$40 $25 (38% off) Best Buy$40 ohsnap!$40 $25 (38% off) TargetThis super thin grip doubles as a stand, is magnetic so it can mount almost anywhere, and is MagSafe charging compatible. The grip is very slim and recedes into itself, so it doesn't get caught on my pockets when I pull it out, and it is actually thinner than my iPhone's camera lens bumps. It also has a nano-adhesive, meaning it takes a lot more effort to take off, in part because you can use other MagSafe accessories on top of it—plus, it's the longest-lasting phone grip I've ever had, still staying strong after almost a year of use.Although the adhesive is reusable, if you want a break from the grip/stand, you can run water over it, let it air dry, and it'll reactivate and re-adhere to your phone or case. The grip is compatible with most phones made in the last 15 years, and with most magnetic and MagSafe wireless chargers. I'm disabled, and this MagSafe grip has been super helpful to increase stability while holding my phone. I use it to prop up my phone so I don't have to hold it while doing activities, and its magnetism is great for doing things like sticking it to the fridge while I cook. —Molly HigginsA MagSafe Case With a Physical KeyboardPhotograph: Brenda Stolyar; Getty ImagesClicksKeyboard Case for iPhone$139 Clicks (All)$139 Best Buy (16 Pro)$159 Best Buy (Pro Max)This is probably one of the most unique cases you'll come across, thanks to the built-in physical keyboard. The Clicks Case (8/10, WIRED Recommends) for the iPhone 16 range isn't for everyone—you'll want to commit to spending days, if not weeks, getting used to physical keys. But if you miss the days of tapping urgent messages into your old Blackberry, you'll feel right at home with this case. It supports MagSafe, works with CarPlay (though you need to type in a code each time to get it to work), and you no longer will have a virtual keyboard hogging 50 percent of your iPhone's screen.The iPhone 17 cases aren't available yet, but you can reserve one.A MagSafe Camera CagePhotograph: Julian ChokkattuMomentMobile Filmmaker Cage for MagSafe$102 B&H$78 AdoramaIf you're a budding cinematographer, Moment's Mobile Filmmaker Cage is arguably the best accessory to snag. Your iPhone magnetically sticks to the center mount, and you can add all sorts of other gear to the various cold-shoe and attachment points on the cage around—lights, mics, you name it. Then use the cage as a grip! No need to touch your iPhone and cause unnecessary shakes. It's seriously awesome.The company announced a new version that goes a step further—the Supercage ($199). I haven't tested it yet, but it includes a hub, which is a game-changer for serious video professionals who use an iPhone. The hub supports 100-watt passthrough power, includes an SD card slot (or you can connect an SSD), and has an HDMI out for external monitors, not to mention a 3.5-mm headphone jack for lav mics. Just like the standard Filmmaker Cage, it has mounting options all around for all that gear.A Clampable Phone MountPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuESRMagSafe Airplane Phone Holder$13 AmazonIf you're the type of person to download a bunch of shows on your phone to watch on a flight, only to find yourself craning your head the entire time to see the tiny phone screen, this clamp will do wonders for your neck. ESR's compact airplane mount can clamp onto thin surfaces, like the tray table on a flight, but it works surprisingly well on a variety of desktops if they aren't too thick. Plop your phone on the strong magnetic ring and enjoy. You can angle it any way you want, and when you're done, the magnetic ring folds down for compact storage.A MagSafe TrayPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuCourantMag:3 Classics$150 $105 (30% off) Amazon$200 CourantI love trays like this in my entryway for tossing shades or house keys. Why not your phone, too? Courant's MAG:3 can be had in linen or leather (I tested the latter). There's one MagSafe puck for your smartphone that charges at standard rates (7.5 watts), and the one on the right is a basic Qi charger for juicing up wireless earbuds. There's an extra USB-C charging port to charge another device via a cable. None of this will be super speedy, but I find it's a great way to “leave the smartphone” by the front door so I'm not constantly on it after coming home. I've been using it for a year, and it hasn't given me trouble.A MagSafe Mount for BikesPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuPeak DesignEveryday Case With MagSafe$50 Amazon (Mount)$50 Amazon (Cases)$50 Peak Design (Mount)$50 Peak Design (Everyday Case)With my old bike mount, I had to wrangle rubber straps around my phone to secure it to my handlebars. It took a few minutes! With Peak Design's Universal Bike Mount, the whole process takes a second. And it's more secure than many other MagSafe mounts because it locks the iPhone in place. (You need to push a button to unlock it and remove the iPhone, but you can do it with one hand.) After many years and miles on roads of varying degrees of quality, my iPhone has yet to fall off. The caveat is that you have to use Peak Design's Everyday Case for it to work with the mount. You can attach other MagSafe accessories to the back of the case just fine (and it still supports wireless charging).A Travel-Friendly MagSafe 3-in-1 ChargerPhotograph: Simon HillAnkerMagGo UFO 3-in-1 Qi2 Charger$90 $66 (27% off) Amazon$90 AnkerThere are many variations of this kind of travel-friendly MagSafe wireless charger, like the Twelve South ButterFly SE or the Native Union Voyage. Anker kicks things up a notch with its own version, which is a 3-in-1 charger as opposed to a 2-in-1 like its competitors. And it still manages to cost less, despite including a cable and power supply, not to mention the latest Qi2 support for speedy charging. The middle pad is for AirPods, the Apple Watch charger is on the right, and you can put your iPhone on the left. It has to lie flat and can't be propped up, but it's the lightest and most compact 3-in-1 charging system. It also just looks weird (in a good way).Rev Up With a MagSafe Car MountPhotograph: Simon HillBelkinBoostCharge Pro Car Charger$70 Walmart$80 BelkinCompact and discreet, this vent mount has clingy prongs and a powerful array of magnets to ensure MagSafe-enabled iPhones don't budge an inch, even on bumpy roads. It can wirelessly charge your iPhone at a maximum 15-watt rate. An adjustable ball joint allows you to angle your phone for a better view. The USB-C cable is long and permanently attached, and it comes with a plug-in charger for folks without USB-C ports in their car. I have an option for folks who prefer a dash mount below.Read our Best Car Phone Accessories guide for more. —Simon HillA Headphone Stand and Wireless ChargerPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuSatechi2-in-1 Headphone Stand With MagSafe Wireless Charger$80 $56 (30% off) Amazon$80 AdoramaI love multipurpose gadgets. Why waste valuable desk real estate with a simple wireless charger when you can have a combo that does the same and holds your headphones? Satechi's headphone stand looks elegant, and the sturdy rubberized base has no problem carrying my headphones when they're out of use. A spot on the stand holds your cables out of the way, which comes in handy if you use the spare USB-C port on the base to recharge your wireless headphones as they dangle.The base doubles as a MagSafe charger that will recharge your iPhone at 7.5 watts (not the fastest speeds), and it's managed to magnetically hold everything from the iPhone 16 Pro Max to the iPhone 14 Pro with no trouble. It will even work with Android phones; you'll just need to be more precise with placement. Just know that Satechi doesn't include a power adapter, so you'll need one that can at least hit 18 watts, like this one.The Best MagSafe StandPhotograph: Jacob RoachCourtesy of Twelve SouthChevronChevronTwelve SouthCurve Nano$35 Amazon$35 Twelve SouthTwelve South’s Curve Nano just won’t budge. It’s a slim travel stand for MagSafe and Qi2 devices, and nothing more. It’s not the features that count here, but the quality. I’ve been using the Curve Nano for weeks, and in between popping up my phone and nervously fiddling with the hinge, it still feels as buttery smooth as the day I unboxed it. It’s extremely portable, too. The Curve Nano collapses in on itself and becomes less than 8 mm thick when it’s folded, and Twelve South even includes a slim travel case to keep the powder-coated finish (available in Dune, Coastal Blue, and Slate) looking fresh.A Wallet With Space for an AirTagPhotograph: Jacob RoachPhotograph: Jacob RoachCourtesy of SupcaseChevronChevronSupcaseMagFlip$40 Amazon$36 Walmart$45 Best BuyThe SupCase MagSage Wallet is an absolute unit. I’m talking about metal hinges, a chunky metal stand, and magnets capable of up to 3,000 grams of force, plus a circular locking mechanism on the back that can hold an AirTag. It more than doubles the thickness of your MagSafe or Qi2 device, but SupCase uses the space well. The wallet can store up to five cards, and SupCase uses a unique stand design. Rather than just propping up your phone like most MagSafe Wallets, the SupCase MagFlip folds down and elevates the device with a separate kickstand. It brings your phone much closer to eye level, which is perfect for long flights, so your neck doesn’t droop.A Chic MagSafe GripPhotograph: Jacob RoachCourtesy of BenksChevronChevronBenksArmorPop Magnetic Phone Grip$30 $27 (10% off) AmazonEveryone loves a PopSocket, but I've recently fallen for this little grip from Benks. The ArmorPop grip builds on an older Benks grip with a Kevlar and reinforced alloy construction, making an already great design even better. On the outer edge of the grip, there's a metal ring that props your phone up in landscape or portrait mode, and in the center, you get a grip, fit with a tiny loop to slide your finger through. The grip can rotate in the center of the ring, so it's super easy to find a proper hold with one hand. And, when you're done, it snaps right back into place automatically.Read our Best MagSafe Grips for more.A Versatile MagSafe TripodCourtesy of JobyJobyGripTight Tripod Mount for MagSafe$56 Moment$52 Amazon (Mount Only)Clamping a phone onto a tripod can be annoying. Buttons get pressed, your case might be too thick, or the iPhone just might slip out of your hands in the process. None of that will happen with this MagSafe tripod. The circular mount has magnets embedded, so it takes a second to attach an iPhone to this thing. There are clamps that slide out in case you want additional security (or you want to attach a non-MagSafe iPhone). The bottom half is the classic GorillaPod bendy tripod system you can mold to stay secure pretty much anywhere, and the mount can be removed and attached to most other tripods. Two threads also mean you can hook up video lights or a microphone.A 2-in-1 Qi2 ChargerPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuBelkinUltraCharge 2-in-1 Foldable Magnetic Wireless Charger (Qi2 25W)$60 Amazon$60 BelkinDon't have an Apple Watch? Get a 2-in-1 charger instead. If you want to charge AirPods or any other wireless earbuds with wireless charging support alongside your smartphone, this one has you covered. Belkin’s smart design lets you fold the whole thing up, making it great for travel. The second wireless charger on the back for wireless earbuds recharges at 5 watts, whereas the phone charger supports Qi2 25W, for the fastest wireless charging speeds when paired with Qi2 25W phones. I love that Belkin actually includes a 45W power adapter and USB-C cable.Other Good MagSafe AccessoriesThe accessories below aren't as great as the top picks in this guide, but they're still good options if you're looking for more MagSafe gadgets.Belkin iPhone Mount With MagSafe.
Photograph: Julian ChokkattuBelkin iPhone Mount With MagSafe for $30: Using Apple's Continuity Camera feature, you can wirelessly use your iPhone as a webcam for a MacBook. It supports various video calling apps too, from FaceTime to Zoom. This circular silicone puck magnetically sticks to the back of your iPhone and can be used as a phone grip or kickstand, but you need to keep your screen close to a 90-degree angle, or else the weight of the iPhone will drag the screen back or forward. There's also a mount for external displays, in case you want one for your home desk setup.STM Goods MagPod Smarter Phone Stand for $31: I've been carrying this mini tripod from STM Goods all over my apartment. When I'm not using it to see notifications at a glance at my desk, I'll place it on my kitchen counter to stream TV shows while cooking dinner, on my coffee table to FaceTime with friends while on the couch, or on the bathroom sink to listen to podcasts while doing my makeup. I've also used it to shoot video. It has a magnetic disc with a socket that moves around smoothly, allowing you to position it at multiple angles. The retractable legs are sturdy too, even while tapping through notifications or typing out texts. They fold in neatly into a compact size, making it easy to travel with.Casetify Wireless Car Charger for $70: I've been using this for over a year. It's easy to install, has MagSafe support (with a USB-C cable) and an adjustable ball joint for various viewing angles, and it’s Qi 2-certified with a 15-watt rate. It's a bit more affordable than Belkin's and comes in several fun patterns. (I have the Penguin design, and it's tough not to smile while looking at it.)iOttie Velox Pro Magnetic Wireless Cooling Charger for $80: This iOttie option has a suction cup (if your vents are awkward, or you just prefer a dash or windshield mount) that has strong magnets to keep it in place. The telescopic arm also has a ball joint to give you a wide range of movement to find the ideal position. The 7.5-watt charging rate is disappointing, but the USB-C charging cable is removable, so you can detach and stow it when your iPhone is charged. The built-in fan also helps to keep the temperature down when the sun is out.MagGo Magnetic Charging Station (8-in-1) for $60: This little orb has three AC outlets, two USB-C ports, and two USB-A ports on the back, and over on the front is a Qi2 wireless charging pad that can recharge your phone. It's great for workstations where you need to plug in a lot of gadgets. Each of the USB-A ports dishes out 12 watts, and the USB-C ports can output 67 watts, though this lowers if other ports or the pad are in use.Photograph: Julian ChokkattuA MagSafe SSD Enclosure for $60: If you have an iPhone Pro Max and you want to tinker with Apple's more advanced video recording formats (ProRes 4K at 60 frames per second or higher), well, you'll run into one big problem immediately: You can't natively record without an external storage device. You'll need a solid-state drive plugged into your iPhone, and it will record your video directly to the external storage. But a dangling SSD doesn't sound very safe, right? They don't transfer power or data via MagSafe but merely attach to the back as a convenient way to store the SSD while recording.Casely Grippy for $25: When Octobuddy (the original suction phone mount) started to get popular, I really wanted one. But since it uses adhesive to attach to your phone, the thought of all the dust and germs the suction cups would collect kept me from trying it. This one from Casely is one of the few that has MagSafe support. It works well, for the most part. I've stuck it on kitchen cabinets, mirrors, the refrigerator—basically whatever surface is around. But when sticking it on said surface, I recommend applying extra pressure to make sure the suction cups are really stuck on there. Otherwise, it'll slide off, and your phone will go with it.What Is MagSafe?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronMagSafe is the name of Apple’s accessory system integrated into the iPhone 12, iPhone 13, iPhone 14, iPhone 15, iPhone 16, and iPhone 17 ranges. A ring of magnets on the back of the phone (and in MagSafe cases) can help transfer power more precisely and faster than traditional wireless chargers. However, it's also a handy way to hold an accessory in place, like a wallet, or to mount the iPhone without requiring clamps.Although MagSafe is a term made by Apple, Android phones like the Google Pixel 10 are getting MagSafe-like features with the new Qi2 standard. Most of the time, a MagSafe accessory will work without issues with Qi2 devices.Make Sure Your Case Has MagSafe TooAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronIf you use a case with your iPhone, make sure it's a MagSafe case (it should have its own ring of magnets inside). A standard case will just weaken the magnetic attachment between the iPhone and the MagSafe accessory. A MagSafe case will maintain the magnetic strength, and sometimes case-makers use stronger magnets for a more secure attachment. We have lots of recommendations in our iPhone case guides:Best iPhone 17 CasesBest iPhone 16 CasesBest iPhone 15 CasesBest iPhone 14 CasesBest iPhone 13 CasesBest iPhone 12 CasesIs MagSafe Compatible With Android?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronNatively, no. MagSafe won't work with most Android phones. However, there are MagSafe cases for certain Android phones, like the Google Pixel series or Samsung Galaxy phones, and these cases have a similar (if not the same) magnetic ring inside, allowing you to use many of the same MagSafe power banks, wireless chargers, and other accessories, though your mileage may vary. Several accessory companies also include or sell the MagSafe magnetic component that you can stick to the back of your smartphone to enable compatibility, though I've never used one I really like.The Qi2 wireless charging standard is changing all of this. Qi2 adds the Magnetic Power Profile, which is based on MagSafe. That means Qi2 phones feature a similar magnetic attachment system, enabling MagSafe accessories to work with more devices, no case needed. Unfortunately, there aren't many Android phones with Qi2 natively baked in. Samsung's Galaxy S25 series, for example, are “Qi2 Ready” phones because you need a magnetic case to enable the Qi2 functionality as there's no magnets built into the phone. The recent Google Pixel 10 series is the first range to fully support Qi2, so we should see more devices throughout the next 12 to 18 months.That's why you may also start seeing “Qi2” MagSafe devices—the latest iPhones all support Qi2, and any device you buy with Qi2 will offer maximum compatibility.Power up with unlimited access to WIRED.
