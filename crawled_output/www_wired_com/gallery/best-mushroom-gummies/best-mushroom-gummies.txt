You’ve seen the adaptogenic lattes and the “high-quality” mushroom-extracted tinctures endorsed by influencers who smile like they’ve never experienced a bad hair day. Now, inevitably, functional fungi have been gummified, promising to boost your immune system, clear brain fog, and sharpen your cognitive function.The appeal of functional mushroom gummies is obvious. They taste more like candy and your childhood than a dietary supplement. But while shrooms have legitimate benefits, mushroom supplements don’t come without asterisks. I talked to the experts, reviewed the labels, and taste-tested my weight in fruity fungus chewables to find the ones that are more than just expensive candy. We liked Om’s rigorous sourcing for the Master Blend Mushroom Gummies ($30) and thought Plant People's WonderDay Gummies ($33) tasted the best, but read on for more of the best mushroom gummies, according to science and a very overstimulated digestive system.For more wellness recommendations, check out our guides to the Best Mushroom Coffee, Best Natural Sleep Aids, and Best Protein Powders.Table of ContentsAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronCompare Top 3 Mushroom GummiesHonorable MentionsAvoid These Mushroom GummiesFAQsWhat to Look for When Buying Mushroom Gummies?Are There Any Potential Side Effects of Mushroom Gummies?How We Test Mushroom GummiesWhat Are We Testing Next?Updated September 2025: I've added honorable mentions, mushroom gummies to avoid, and an FAQ section.Best Mushroom Blend OverallPhotograph: Boutayna ChokraneCourtesy of OmPhotograph: Boutayna ChokraneChevronChevronOmMaster Blend Mushroom Gummies$30 Om$30 $23 (23% off) AmazonOm sets the standard with its careful sourcing and rigorous transparency. Unlike many mushroom supplements that focus on extracts or isolated compounds, Om’s Master Blend utilizes the entire mushroom: mycelium, primordia, and fruiting body. This means you’re consuming the full spectrum of bioactive compounds, including beta-glucans, polyphenols, and prebiotic fibers.Each gummy is powered by a blend of 10 functional species (cordyceps, reishi, etc.) grown indoors at the company’s cGMP-certified, BRCGS AA-rated facility in San Diego. The mushrooms are cultivated using solid-state fermentation, a process in which the mycelium feeds on gluten-free organic oats and transforms them into bioavailable nutrients.Every step of the process is traceable. Every ingredient is verified. Every batch is tested. The gummies are certified organic, non-GMO, gluten-free, and kosher, making them suitable for nearly any diet or lifestyle. Unfortunately, they taste like dirt.This is a mushroom blend, so you don't know how much of each you're actually consuming. Om makes single-mushroom gummies, too, like Lion's Mane Mushroom Gummies for brain health and cognitive performance, Reishi for immune support, and Cordyceps for endurance and recovery. Just don't expect them to taste any better.SpecsActive IngredientsOrganic mushroom powder blend (lion's mane, reishi, chaga, cordyceps, turkey tail, shiitake, maitake, king trumpet, Himematsutake, Antrodia)Other IngredientsOrganic tapioca syrup, organic cane sugar, water, pectin, citric acid, organic natural flavor, organic fruit and vegetable juice (color), sodium citrate, organic monk fruit extractHow to UseChew 2 gummies, 1-2 times per day, or as directed by a health care professional.WIRED/TIREDAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWIREDUses the whole mushroom, no extraction processesCertified Good Manufacturing Practices and BRCGS AA ratingCertified organic, kosher, and non-GMOTIREDDosage of each mushroom isn't specifiedA one-mushroom gummy might give you more noticeable resultsTerrible tasteBest TastingCourtesy of Plant PeoplePlant PeopleWonderDay Mushroom Gummies$30 Plant People$35 AmazonPlant People’s WonderDay Mushroom Gummies are sugar-free but taste like candy. Made with a blend of eight functional mushrooms, including royal sun, lion’s mane, turkey tail, and others, they somehow avoid an earthy flavor. Actually, they’re raspberry-flavored. They’re plant-based, non-GMO, and allergen-free. The mushrooms are grown in the United States, primarily in the Rocky Mountains, using regenerative practices. Plant People is a B Corp and Climate Neutral Certified company.Across the board, Plant People’s functional mushroom gummies are easy to take, with no bitter aftertaste. Other options include WonderSleep (elderberry-flavored), WonderCalm (peach-flavored), WonderBurn (mango), and WonderBeauty, a watermelon gummy featuring tremella mushroom, biotin, keratin, and marine collagen for skin, hair, and nail support. Plant People offers trial packs, allowing you to sample without committing to a full bag.According to the brand, the WonderDay effects (stress relief, better mood, consistent energy levels) build over the first month of consumption. I tried them for five days, which isn’t enough time to say if they “worked,” but it was enough to make me crave more. Plant People has third-party tested some products, like its CBD tinctures, but none of its gummies have been vetted, sadly.SpecsActive IngredientsLion’s Mane, Cordyceps, Reishi mushroom, Chaga, Maitake mushroom, Turkey Tail, Shiitake, Royal SunOther IngredientsMaltitol, isomalt, water, pectin, organic raspberry flavor, citric acid, vegetable juice (color), sodium citrate, coconut MCT oil, carnauba waxHow to UseTake 2 gummies (or more) per day, or as directed by a health care professional.WIRED/TIREDAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWIREDCandy-like tasteSugar-free, vegan-friendly, and top 8 allergen-freeCertified B-Corp, Climate Neutral Certified, Current Good Manufacturing PracticeTIREDNot third-party testedAll the gummies include other adaptogens and activesDosage of each mushroom in blends aren't specifiedBest for SleepCourtesy of SlumberSlumberRest & Renew Mushroom Sleep Gummies$49 SlumberSlumber’s Rest & Renew Mushroom Sleep Gummies are made with reishi fruiting bodies, chamomile, passionflower, magnesium citrate, and a hint of melatonin. Unfortunately, the doses of all the natural ingredients are pretty modest, which may not be enough for some to feel the effects. I tried them for a week, but they didn’t significantly improve my sleep, which has been consistently disrupted since the invention of TikTok. However, I can see these being helpful for someone who doesn’t struggle to sleep but simply desires a more restful slumber.The aftertaste is unpleasant. Slumber gummy products often have this issue, leading me to believe that it’s not the mushrooms causing it but rather the overall formulation. I have to chase it down with water, and I don’t think I’m being dramatic.SpecsActive IngredientsOrganic Reishi mushroom extract, organic chamomile, chelamax magnesium citrate, organic passion flower, melatonin (500 mcg).Other IngredientsWater, pectin, sugar, sodium citrate, organic tapioca, cane sugar, citric acid, natural color, natural flavoring.How to UseTake 1-2 gummies 30 minutes before bedtime, or as directed by a health care professional.

Alice Chocolates uses reishi, a substance that comes from fruiting mushrooms, along with chamomile, L-theanine, magnesium, and zinc. The idea is that the reishi will help regulate and promote healthy sleep patterns over time, while the added supplements will aid in helping with sleepiness more immediately. The chocolates are vegan, gluten-free, dairy-free, and kosher, and also come in Brainstorm, to aid in energy and focus, and Happy Ending, for arousal and pleasure. The chocolate was tasty—it wasn’t overly sweet and had a nice bitterness like a robust dark chocolate should. The first few nights of testing, I woke up around 4 am, but after I upped the dose to two chocolate squares, I felt more relaxed before bed, fell asleep in a little over an hour, and stayed asleep all night. —Molly HigginsPhotograph: Boutayna ChokraneSunday Scaries Mushroom Gummies for $23: Sunday Scaries deliver a noticeable jolt. Thirty minutes after consumption, I felt that unmistakable caffeine buzz. Flavor-wise, the orange is OK. I don't hate it, but I don't love it. Every batch comes with third-party certifications verifying purity, potency, and safety. The ingredients are sourced—a blend of Lion's Mane Extract, organic Chaga powder, and Gingko Biloba (not a mushroom) extract—from KND Labs in Denver, an FDA-registered, cGMP-certified facility.Avoid These Mushroom GummiesPhotograph: Boutayna ChokraneSpace Goods Moon Chews and Star Chews: Frankly, I somewhat hate to do this, because these chewies taste like candy, but that was the first red flag. No one can make mushrooms taste that good, and Space Goods has no published reports or certifications to back up any of its claims—despite stating they are third-party tested. Not much information on the mushrooms, except that they're sourced in North America and China, which is as vague as a brand can get. “Frustratingly, there are many ingredients and benefits of our products that we can't legally tell you about,” the site's Health Claims page reads. I'm sorry, what?FAQs About Mushroom GummiesWhat to Look for When Buying Mushroom GummiesAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronDecide if you want a mushroom-exclusive gummy or a blend. Some brands add other adaptogens, like ashwagandha or vitamins.Check the amount per serving. Many gummies only include trace amounts (50-100 mg), which may not be enough to have any effect. More research-backed doses usually range from 500 milligrams to two grams daily, depending on the shroom—but consult a healthcare provider to determine the appropriate dosage for you, especially if you're taking other supplements or medications.The label specifies fruiting body extract. Some brands use mostly mycelium on grain, which is cheaper and less potent. Fruiting body extracts are richer in beta-glucans and other active compounds.Look for mention of standardized extracts or percent of beta-glucans. Hot water or dual-extracted mushrooms are better for bioavailability.Certificates of Analysis (COAs) should be accessible on the brand's site. Credible supplements are third-party tested for purity, potency, and heavy metals. Bonus if the brand works with mycologists or sources mushrooms from reputable growers.Since these are gummies, check how much sugar or sweeteners are in each serving. I would aim for less than three grams. If you're intolerant to sugar alcohols, this is especially important.Are There Any Potential Side Effects of Mushroom Gummies?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronFunctional mushroom gummies are generally considered safe for most healthy adults, but like any supplement, they can cause side effects or interact with medications. Possible side effects include, but are not limited to: gastrointestinal discomfort, drowsiness or stimulation, and allergic reactions. It's best to start with a low dose and talk to a doctor before adding a new supplement to your daily routine, especially if you have chronic health conditions.In the past, mushroom gummies sold at convenience stores and smoke shops have tested positive for undisclosed, illegal stimulants (including psilocybin and kratom). Because labels can be misleading, avoid impulse buys of mushroom gummies from non-regulated retailers, and choose only lab-tested supplements with third-party certificates.How We Test Mushroom GummiesAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronIngredients: I start by checking whether the mushroom gummies contain fruiting body extracts or mycelium, which are the two most common sources of functional mushrooms. The fruiting body—which is the stem and cap of the shroom—typically has higher concentrations of beta-glucans and triterpenes than the root, or mycelium. I also flag any additives, added sweeteners, or mysterious proprietary blends.Third-Party Testing: Since the FDA doesn't evaluate supplements before they hit the market, I prioritize brands that publish third-party certificates of analysis (COAs).Taste and Texture: What's the point of a gummy supplement if it doesn't taste good? I gauge flavor, chewiness, and aftertaste. I also pay attention to packaging and take note of how they hold up over time with proper storage.Experience: We can't verify every wellness claim, but I do regularly take the gummies myself and track whether products seem to support the health benefits they advertise. I also look through the customer reviews to get an idea of what other users' experiences are.What Are We Testing Next?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronI'll be testing Nütrops by grüns Daily Gummies for $60 and Noon In the Zone Chocolate for $23.Power up with unlimited access to WIRED.
