What's better than dinner while watching the alpenglow on the peaks around you? The view is the only thing that makes that freeze-dried mush palatable.If you want to cook, you need a stove, and you need one that won't weight you down, doesn't run afoul of fire bans, and can cook what you want to cook, whether that's boil-in-a-bag meals or fresh trout. To help you figure out the best backpacking stove for every adventure, we've boiled water in the wind, sautéed trout on the Bois Brule, dined on countless freeze-dried meals, and drunk the milk of paradise. Or at least some halfway decent coffee. These are the stoves that have proved themselves over the miles.Don't forget to check out the rest of our outdoor guides, including the Best Backpacking Water Filters, the Best Backpacking Tents, and the Best Bug Spray.Jump ToAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronTop 6 Backpacking Stoves ComparedHonorable MentionsFAQTips and TricksThe Best Ultralight Backpacking StovePhotograph: Scott GilbertsonPhotograph: Scott GilbertsonPhotograph: Scott GilbertsonChevronChevronMSRPocketRocket Deluxe$85 REI$85 AmazonMSR's PocketRocket Series has long been a favorite of backpackers looking to save weight. Our pick of the bunch is the PocketRocket Deluxe, which has a larger burner area (spreading out the flame and leading to faster boil times and better fuel efficiency, especially with larger pots), and fared better in the wind. The genius of the deluxe model is the small curved lip around the burner, which helps keep wind from getting to the base of the flame. It's a small difference, and you still want a windscreen. But it's enough that over the long term I found it more effective at maintaining a simmer in the wind, should you want to do any actual cooking. The deluxe model also features a piezo igniter. I would still carry a lighter, but it's nice to have the igniter switch option to quickly relight it.The PocketRocket Deluxe works well as a stove for a solo traveler, but the larger burner head also makes it great for larger pots, like a 1400 ml, which is plenty for two. Anything larger than that and all fuel canister stoves like this get a little unstable. You can do it, but the risk of your food ending up tipped over in the dirt increases. For larger groups, I suggest pairing off in twos for cooking purposes, or go for a remote canister stove like the MSR WhisperLite or Firebox stoves below. It's collapsible and stores pretty well, though it is 0.3 ounces heavier and slightly taller (0.2 inches) than the PocketRocket 2, which means it might be a tighter squeeze fitting it in some pots.SpecsWeight2.9 oz (73 g)Size3.3 x 2.2 x 1.8 inchesMax people you can cook for2The Best Budget Solo StovePhotograph: Scott GilbertsonPhotograph: Scott GilbertsonPhotograph: Scott GilbertsonChevronChevronBRS3000T Ultralight Stove$17 AmazonThe BRS 3000T is a legend in the ultralight community. It's tiny, weighs a mere 26 grams, and costs just $16. You're not going to do any fancy cooking on this one, but if all you need is some boiled water for dehydrated meals, it's more than capable. You might be wondering then, what's the catch? Why isn't this our top pick? Simply put, you really can't cook on it. It's a tiny flame, and unless you disperse it somehow, you'll never be able to do anything but boil water. Even then, I recommend a narrow pot, like the Toaks 750 titanium or, at largest, the 900 ml MSR Titan. That said, for many people, that's enough. The other issue I have with the BRS 3000T is that it's really affected by wind. Definitely bring a windscreen of some kind.I have seen more than a few reports of the support arms seeming to melt in some circumstances, but I've had no problems. It appears to be a quality-control issue. My suggestion is to do a 10- to 15-minute run of the BRS 3000T at home before you hit the trail to make sure it can handle it. If you don't think it's worth the risk, our top pick is only 54 grams heavier. I also know some people carry two of these just in case.SpecsWeight0.92 oz (26 g)Size3.22 x 3.15 x 2.37 inchesMax people you can cook for2Best Backpacking Stove for Actually CookingPhotograph: Scott GilbertsonPhotograph: Scott GilbertsonChevronChevronFireboxNano Folding Stove & Gas Burner$90 Firebox$50 Amazon (Folding Stove Only)The Firebox Gas Burner with its diffusion plate is hands down the best backcountry cooking system. For many people, backpacking isn't about the food, but I've found that, especially with kids, some good food goes a long way to making the trip more enjoyable. In fact, I rarely take my kids backpacking without also bringing this stove.There's two parts to this system: the stove, which is the box portion, and the burner, which connects to your isobutane canister. The secret here, and what makes this the best stove for cooking, is the diffusion plate, which spreads out the flame, making it possible to heat a 10-inch pan. Yes, it's still cooler out toward the edges, but this tiny little stove is every bit as capable of cooking as a full-size Coleman camp stove. I've cooked everything from fish the kids caught to cinnamon rolls on this thing (often in combination with the 10-inch fry pan).As an added bonus, the Firebox Nano (which here serves as the stand for the Firebox gas burner) is also a stand-alone twig stove and can hold a Trangia Spirit Burner (see below), making it an extremely versatile backpacking stove. It won't win you any prizes at the next /r/Ultralight get-together (the Firebox Nano on its own weighs 4.25 ounces for the titanium version), but you could be eating some delicious food in the backcountry. Did I mention it comes with a grill plate that turns it into a tiny gas grill?SpecsWeight8.5 oz (240 g)Size3 x 4.25 x .25 inches (folded)Max people you can cook for3Best Alcohol StovePhotograph: Scott GilbertsonPhotograph: Scott GilbertsonPhotograph: Scott GilbertsonChevronChevronTrangiaSpirit Burner$25 Amazon$15 TrangiaTrangia's Spirit Burner is the best alcohol stove I've used, thanks to the simmer control lid, which allows you to do more than just boil water. At 3.5 ounces (without a stand, which you need) it's on the heavy side. Ultralight backpackers may be better served by a DIY stove. Bikepacker.com has a nice roundup of soda can designs you can experiment with. I've used both homemade burners and the Trangia spirit burner, and these days I almost always bring the Trangia. The cooking options it opens up far outweigh the 2oz weight gain.As with almost any alcohol stove, you'll need some kind of stand. My favorite is the lightweight Clikstand stand (as of this writing the lighter titanium version is sold out, but the stainless version is only 1 oz heavier). It securely holds the Spirit Burner and provides an additional windscreen. Alcohol can be transported in anything plastic. I use an old soda bottle, though I have tested and like Vargo's fuel bottle. For bikepacking, I generally use a Trangia bottle, which is heavier but more durable when strapped to your bike frame. Denatured alcohol can be bought just about everywhere. (This handy guide has the local name of it around the world.) Everywhere, that is, but California. Californians, try Everclear. It works just as well.Note that alcohol stoves are considered open flame under some burn bans. Check with the agency that oversees the land you'll be traveling on, and be careful—alcohol burns odorless and nearly invisibly. Learn to use (and put out) your stove before you hit the trail.SpecsWeight4.1 oz (116 g)Size2.85 x 1.75 inchesMax people you can cook for2The Best Go-Anywhere, Burn-Anything StovePhotograph: Scott GilbertsonPhotograph: Scott GilbertsonPhotograph: Scott GilbertsonChevronChevronMSRWhisperLite International$160 $145 (9% off) Amazon$160 REIMSR's venerable WhisperLite is the best choice when you don't know what kind of fuel you'll need. It's not lightweight (15 ounces with all three fuel adapters), but it'll burn isobutane canisters, white gas, auto gasoline, and kerosene. The WhisperLite is, as the name suggests, pretty quiet for a pressurized burn system (which is what it uses for everything but the isobutane). Liquid fuel stoves like this are somewhat fiddly, requiring some effort to prime and light, but it's also a well-tested design that will work anywhere under any conditions. I have cooked on this stove in the mountains, the desert, the snow, and everywhere in between. There is a learning curve, though, so make sure you practice with it before you hit the trail. And forget about simmering when using the liquid fuels. It's nearly impossible if there's any kind of breeze.The downside of the WhisperLite is the weight. Most backpackers hitting the trail in North America don't need this level of versatility, as canister fuel can be found just about everywhere. Where the International shines is on long trips abroad, where fuel sources are unknown. But if you want to have only one stove for everything, this would be my pick.SpecsWeight15 oz (425 g)Size6 x 6 x 4.75 inchesMax people you can cook for4-6Best All-in-One Ultralight StoveCourtesy of Johnson OutdoorsCourtesy of Johnson OutdoorsChevronChevronJetboilStash$146 Amazon$165 REISure, you can put together a slightly lighter cooking setup pairing our top pick and a 750-ml Toaks pot, but Jetboil's Stash is the lighest all-in-one system out there and it does boil water a bit faster than the rest so long as the wind is not blowing much. The heat diffuser design is what speeds up boil times (Jetboil claims 2.5 minutes, which I was only able to match indoor in still air), but the real appeal here to me is the way this kit all packs down into itself. For weekend trips, this is the simplest system I've tested when it come to cooking for two. Boil water, pour over your freeze dried pouch, done.I found the Stash (and it's larger, heavier cousin the Jetboil Flash 1L) very reliable and quick to boil water. Unfortunately the time savings doesn't translate into a ton of fuel savings (and therefore weight savings) unless you're out for four days or more. If you are doing a longer trip, then the Stash is worth considering as it could save about 2 to 4 grams of fuel per boil.SpecsWeight7.1 oz (201 g) (includes pot)Size4.4 x 5.1 inchesMax people you can cook for2Top 6 Backpacking Stoves ComparedFuelWeight (stove only)Simmer controlAuto IgnitionMSR Pocket Rocket DeluxeIsobutane-propane2.9 oz (73 g)yesyesFirebox Nano & Gas BurnerIsobutane-propane/Wood8.5 oz (240 g)yesnoTrangia Spirit BurnerAlcohol4.1 oz (116 g)yesnoBRS 3000TIsobutane-propane0.92 oz (26 g)nonoMSR WhisperLite InternationalIsobutane-propane, White Gas, Gasoline, Kerosene15 oz (425 g)sometimesnoJetboil StashIsobutane-propane7.1 oz (201 g) (includes pot)yesnoHonorable MentionsThere are a ton of tiny stoves out there.

They're still fine and might be a great choice for your next backpacking trip.Courtesy of PrimusPrimusEssential Trail Stove$30 Amazon$45 PrimusThis little stove works very well. The pot supports are shorter than our top pick, meaning it's best with 500 ml or smaller pots, but it's plenty powerful and held up well in the wind during my testing.

It's a fine stove, and the price is reasonable, but there's nothing that makes it better than any of the stoves above. It's a little heavy for what it is.
Frequently Asked QuestionsWhich Type of Stove Is Best for Backpacking?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronCanister? Alcohol? Traditional white gas? There's a wealth of options out there, so which one is The Best™? The answer is that it depends on where you're going (altitude, weather, burn bans, etc), what you're cooking, and how long you're backpacking. Thru-hikers have a different set of needs than those of us who only get in a few weekends and maybe one 10-day trip a year. That said, our top pick is a great choice for both thru-hiking and weekend warriors. I love alcohol stoves for their silence and simplicity, but burn bans sometimes mean they're not permitted. When in doubt, a lightweight canister stove setup is your best bet. The exception is cold weather. Inverted canister stoves do better in cold, but I rely on white gas anytime I think the temps will dip below 20 degrees Fahrenheit.What's the Best Stove for Actually Cooking?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronDefinitely the Firebox Nano paired with the gas burner and diffuser plate. There's a weight penalty for all that, though. The titanium version is 8.5 ounces, but it cooks like a Coleman camp stove thanks to that diffuser plate. As noted above, it is possible to heat a 10-inch pan out to the edges, something no other backpacking stove has pulled off in my tests.If you don't want to carry that much weight, the MSR PocketRocket Deluxe offers the best flame control, though there is no way to spread out the flame and evenly heat your pans. Note that aluminum pans heat more evenly than titanium (and they're much cheaper), so pairing the PocketRocket Deluxe with an aluminum pan will give you the best results in my experience.All that said, be honest with yourself about cooking in the backcountry. I enjoy it, and I do do it, but I only do it when it makes sense. If you're trying to cover 20-30 miles a day, cooking a complex meal isn't what you want to do at the start and end of every day. For those trips, keep it simple, keep it light.How Much Should My Stove Weigh?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronAs little as possible while still being functional. Seriously, it depends on what you want to do. If you're solo and you just want enough water to rehydrate a pouch of food you can get by with something around an ounce or two. If you want to cook up a proper meal for tired children, it might be worth carrying a little extra weight.Should You Buy a Stove System?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronThat's up to you. They do often make life on the trail easier, thanks to the way most stove-pot combo systems click together and pack down nice and small. But if you're looking to go ultralight and cut weight as much as possible, the answer is definitely no. A small, lightweight pot with either the MSR PocketRocket Deluxe or BRS 3000 and a DIY foil windscreen weighs less than any integrated stove system I've tested. Pro tip: make your own lightweight pot lid out of some heavy duty foil to save even more weight.Why Don't You List Boil Times?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronBecause fast boil times are a silly number made up by the industry so that it would have something to compare and brag about. The time it takes to boil water depends on factors no one can control in the real world, including starting water temp, ambient air temp, altitude, wind, and more. Even if you control for all of those factors to try to abstract out a number, it won't tell you anything, because some stoves are better than others in the wind, so you can't extrapolate anything about their performance in still air that will map to their performance in wind. All of which makes boil times a completely useless number.What Backpacking Stove Do You Use?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronI own several stoves, but honestly, I am usually cooking on whatever I am testing for this guide. On the rare occasions I don't have a new stove to test … it depends. For solo trips covering good distances I use the top pick, the MSR PocketRocket Deluxe. When I'm bikepacking or backpacking with my kids, I use the Firebox Freestyle stove split into two units, one with a Trangia spirit burner and one with the gas burner. Dividing all that up between 4 people keeps the weight reasonable (total weight for this setup is 26 ounces) and effectively gives me a two-burner stove and a twig fire, which is nice when you don't know what you'll be able to buy when resupplying on the trail. In cold weather, I rely on an MSR WhisperLite International that I've had for almost three decades. I kind of hate it, but it's reliable.Tips and TricksOnce you have a stove, get familiar with it. Canister stoves are pretty simple. Screw on the canister, turn the knob, and light. However, other stoves, especially liquid fuel stoves, require a little practice to really get it dialed in.I went outside and made coffee on these stoves every morning for months, playing with variables like simmer controls, canister position, different fuels, windscreens, and more in all kinds of conditions. Even though I'll never actually make coffee in a moka pot on the trail, the experience with each stove means I know how each stove behaves under different conditions. Do something similar until you're familiar with how to control the flame, how to maximize fuel efficiency, and what to do when the wind blows. Here are some other things I've learned over the years about using backcountry stoves:Boiling water doesn't mean a rolling boil: Unless you're trying to sterilize water, you don't need to get to a full rolling boil to rehydrate a meal, and doing so is a waste of fuel. I usually shut the stove off when bubbles are just starting to form on the bottom of my pot. This is plenty hot enough to rehydrate freeze-dried or dehydrated meals.High is not max efficiency: I hate the noise of canister and pressurized white gas, so I've never had this problem, but many people I've camped with seem to think the burner should always be on high. This is usually a waste of energy. (The BRS 3000T is an exception, it really pretty much does need to be high.) This is where experimenting and learning how your stove works helps. Time how long it takes to boil water at different burn levels and use the lowest setting that still effectively boils your water.Remember the weight and volume are not the same: I know, it has been forever since I had high school chemistry too, but remember that weight and volume are different despite the fact that both are often listed in the abbreviation oz. One fluid ounce of alcohol does not weigh one ounce (it weighs 0.8 ounces). One fluid ounce of white gas also does not weigh one ounce (it's about 0.75 ounces). This is important when you're trying to work out the weight of canisters and fuel bottles.Your cooking pot matters: The size and shape of your cookware is important—some boil faster than others on different stoves. Check out this in-depth YouTube rundown of different stove and pot combos to see what I mean, but one takeaway is that, again, this is something worth testing with your stove.CommentsBack to topTriangleScott Gilbertson is Operations Manager for the WIRED Reviews Team.
