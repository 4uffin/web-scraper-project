It's been my personal quest to find the best bamboo sheets, especially since these are possibly the most comfortable sheets you'll ever try. I'm serious—I sleep on at least two dozen different sets of sheets per year (and have tested almost 100 different sets!) as WIRED's resident sheet tester, and I've found again and again that bamboo is consistently softer and silkier than almost every kind of sheet you'll sleep on.After trying so many sheets, here are the ones I can't live without. Aeptom's Organic Bamboo Sateen Bed Sheet Set ($138) is impressively well priced for the super soft feel and double decker certifications it has as both Oeko-Tex bedding and FSC-certified bamboo. (Not sure what that means? Catch our terminology explainer below.) If you're looking for something cooling, Ettitude's CleanBamboo Sheet Set ($333) is beautifully lightweight but still silky soft, allowing for plenty of airflow to keep you cool at night. Love an extra soft sheet? Cozy Earth's Bamboo Sheet Set ($308) are the softest bamboo sheets we've found. If you're on a budget, you won't find a better deal than Bedsure's GentleSoft Bamboo Sheets ($65), though you'll settle for bamboo rayon over viscose.All prices are listed for queen-size sheets.

We've also added a new comparison section and terminology section, plus updated FAQs.Table of ContentsAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronComparing Our Favorite Bamboo SheetsTerminology to Know When ShoppingHonorable MentionsFAQsWhat Types of Bamboo Are There?Are Bamboo Sheets Cooling?Can Bamboo Sheets Be Organic?The Best Bamboo Bed SheetsPhotograph: Nena FarrellPhotograph: Nena FarrellCourtesy of AeptomChevronChevronAeptomBamboo Sateen Bed Sheet Set$138 AeptomI'm all around impressed by these bamboo sheets. The feel is incredibly soft and silky without being too heavy, and the bamboo used is Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certified, which ensures that products come from responsibly managed forests. These sheets are also Oeko-Tex certified to leave out harmful chemicals. Aeptom lists the bamboo used as organic, but there's no overarching organic certification for bamboo like you'll find with cotton. At this price point, it's an impressive combination to find. The only downside is there's no trial period (which is normal not to see at this lower price point), but I truly don't think you'll need one, and there are still 30-day returns.Aeptom also says its bamboo sheets use ultra-fine fibers, which is what makes these sheets feel so soft without being suffocating, similar to why long-staple cotton is so much more comfortable than regular cotton. I was plenty comfortable on these sheets on late-summer nights without waking up sweaty. The top sheet is slippery enough that it usually didn't stay on all night, but I'm an inveterate bedding kicker anyway.Bamboo type100 percent bamboo viscoseCertificationsOeko-Tex, FSC-Certified bambooIncludesFitted sheet, flat sheet, and two pillowcasesSize optionsTwin to king and California kingMattress depthDeep pocket up to 15 inchesTrial period / return policy30-day returnsThe Best Cooling Bamboo SheetsPhotograph: Nena FarrellPhotograph: Nena FarrellPhotograph: EttitudeChevronChevronEttitudeSignature Bamboo Sheet Set$333 Amazon$359 EttitudeEttitude's CleanBamboo Sateen sheets have the silkiness of both bamboo fabric and a sateen weave but still manage to be more breathable than any other bamboo (or sateen) sheet I've tried. These sheets are thinner than any other bamboo set we recommend but are still plenty soft and have held up well in the wash after months of constant use. They're my top pick for a cooling bamboo sheet for a reason: No other bamboo has kept me as cool all night like these sheets do. They're a staple in my summer sheet rotation.While bamboo usually requires harsh chemicals to create either bamboo viscose or rayon, Ettitude says it uses a closed-loop process and has created bamboo lyocell to make its sheets. Lyocell has a more eco-friendly process that's less energy-intensive, too. Ettitude doesn't call its sheets organic but says it does use 100 percent organic bamboo (FSC certified), and its sheets are Oeko-Tex certified to be made without harmful chemicals and pesticides, plus Eco-Cert Certified Organic and many more eco-conscious certifications. They're as close to organic as you can get.Bamboo type100 percent bamboo lyocellCertificationsOeko-Tex, BCorp, Eco-Cert Certified Organic, FSC Certified bamboo, Change ClimateIncludesFitted sheet, flat sheet, and two pillowcasesSize optionsTwin and twin XL up to California kingMattress depthDeep pocket up to 16 inchesTrial period / return policy60 daysThe Softest Bamboo SheetsPhotograph: Nena FarrellCourtesy of Cozy EarthChevronChevronCozy EarthBamboo Sheet Set$330 $308 (7% off) Cozy Earth$330 $308 (7% off) AmazonThe best word to describe Cozy Earth's Bamboo Sheet Set is easy: decadent. These 100 percent bamboo viscose sheets are silky and chilly to the touch, though they have a truly soft feel to them (almost akin to a silky jersey) compared to the slippery soft you'll feel on other bamboo sheets. These bamboo bed sheets feel nice and cool when you climb into them, but warm up nicely as you sleep; I felt like I was surrounded by melted butter in bed with these bed sheets. Not all sheets feel like they're the splurge they are, especially with how expensive good sheets naturally get, but these sheets truly feel like you're sleeping at the best hotel of your life (better, honestly, if you always leave hotels wishing the sheets were actually soft).Since they do get warm in the night, I don't recommend them for hot sleepers in hot seasons, but as a hot sleeper myself I love them in the cooler seasons of the year, especially in spring and late fall when the night starts out warm but ends up chilly in the morning. They're a great winter sheet, too. They're also a great choice if you have a larger mattress, since these have deep pockets and should fit mattresses as tall as 20 inches. You can also purchase the fitted sheet ($128) and flat sheet ($128) separately if something happens to one piece of your set.Bamboo type100 percent bamboo viscoseCertificationsOeko-TexIncludesFitted sheet, flat sheet, and two pillowcases (can buy flat and fitted sheets separately)Size optionsTwin (no XL) to split kingMattress depthDeep pocket up to 20 inchesTrial period / return policy100 nightsAnother Great SetPhotograph: Nena FarrellPhotograph: Nena FarrellPhotograph: LuxomeChevronChevronLuxomeBamboo Luxury Sheet Set$190 LuxomeLuxome's bamboo sheets were our previous top pick, and they're still a great set. These sheets are made of 100 percent bamboo viscose rather than rayon, are Oeko-Tex certified to not use harmful substances, have incredible softness without being too heavy, are a reasonable price, and have deep pockets with elastic straps so that you aren't constantly trying to put these silky sheets back into place. They're cool to the touch but warm up while you're in bed, though they don't warm up so much that you find yourself waking up sweating. It's a perfect balance between soft and cozy without veering into winter-only sheet-hood.Bamboo viscose is better for the environment but costs more to make; you'll pay just as much for good cotton sheets. Luxome's sheets also come in a range of gorgeous colors. The only downsides of these cheaper sheets are that there isn't a trial period (but there's still 30 day returns), and I think they run a little warmer than some of my other favorites. One of the pillows has started pilling after a year of use, though I suspect it could've been due to an unlucky episode with my cat's claws since the rest of the set remains pill-free.Bamboo type100 percent bamboo viscoseCertificationsOeko-TexIncludesFitted sheet, flat sheet, and two pillowcasesSize optionsFrom twin and twin XL up to king and split kingMattress depthDeep pockets up to 15 inchesTrial period / return policy30-day returnsBest Budget Bamboo SheetsPhotograph: Julia ForbesPhotograph: Julia ForbesCourtesy of BedsureChevronChevronBedsureGentleSoft Cooling Sheets$79 $64 (19% off) Amazon$90 BedsureIt always shocks me that the Bedsure GentleSoft Cooling Sheets aren’t more expensive, because I reach for them more than any other set I have—I’m not exaggerating. The bamboo doesn’t make me feel like I’m being smothered in heat, and it has a silklike feel that doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin. When I first bought these, I got them in a peacock teal, which was a colorway I hadn’t seen often on my sheet-buying journey. Happy to report that they’ve maintained their shiny luster after all this time, especially since I’m not easy on these sheets. The dogs scratch at them, and I don’t always follow care instructions carefully in the wash. All to say, they’re just my “life sheets”—if something happens to them, I can’t be that disappointed because I’ve gotten good use out of them for an insane price. The demise has yet to happen, and it’s been years of use at this point. One of the best impulse purchases I’ve ever made, and honestly, I’ll be a repeat customer. —Julia ForbesBamboo type100 percent bamboo rayonCertificationsOeko-TexIncludesFitted sheet, flat sheet, and two pillowcasesSize optionsTwin and twin XL up to California king and split kingMattress depthDeep pocket up to 16 inchesTrial period / return policy30-day returnsA Budget Cooling SetPhotograph: Nena FarrellPhotograph: Nena FarrellPhotograph: NuzzieChevronChevronNuzzieForever Chill Bamboo Sheets$119 NuzzieIf you're looking for something cheaper but are too hot of a sleeper for Quince's bamboo, try Nuzzie's Forever Chill bamboo sheets instead. It's another bamboo viscose set but has a thinner feel to it and better airflow that kept me nice and cool all night long. These sheets are super chilly to the touch, too, which is no surprise given the name.That thinner feel didn't lose out on softness, but I'd say they're the least soft of the bamboo sheets in this guide. If you're looking for something super soft and super cooling, I prefer Ettitude, but these sheets are a close second and less expensive.

Here's a quick breakdown.Bamboo type: You'll see bamboo rayon, viscose, or lyocell listed for the bamboo, which explains what method was used for turning the bamboo into fibers that could become sheets. Rayon is the cheapest, while viscose is a slightly better production process, and lyocell is the most ideal process (but still not a perfect one, and usually the most expensive).Certifications: Some companies will label bamboo sheets as organic, using certifications like Oeko-Tex. You can learn more about organic certification terms here to understand what they each mean, and our thoughts on organic bamboo in our FAQs below. You might also see FSC-certified, which means it was sourced through sustainable forests certified by the Forest Stewardship Council.Honorable MentionsCariloha Classic Bamboo Sheets for $239: Cariloha's Classic Bamboo Sheets have a twill weave, which has a diagonal thread pattern and doesn't sound as soft as a sateen weave that has a three-over-one pattern. But these sheets still felt super soft, and the softness difference compared to the pricier Retreat Sheets ($339) was minor for such a big price difference. There's no corner straps, though.Cariloha Retreat Bamboo Sheets for $339: These sheets are super soft and silky and use lyocell fabric to be more sustainable. They're a similar softness to the brand's cheaper sheets, but if you want to prioritize eco-friendly sheets, lyocell is a good option (though not a perfect carbon-neutral solution). I also really like the included straps, but you can find those on cheaper sets like the Luxome sheets I recommend above.Ettitude Luxe Sheet Set for $470: These sheets are fantastically soft and use a combination of bamboo lyocell and bamboo “biochar” to make them antifungal and odor-resistant. They ran a little warm for my liking, but if you're looking for something to keep odors and fungi away, these could be the splurge for you. Ettitude previously called these Airy+ instead of Luxe, but both use a combination of lyocell and biochar.Honeydew Sheets for $230: These sheets felt a little stiff at first but softened up a bunch after washing. They also come with a securing strap, so they're a good option for taller mattresses. The only downside is that they're only available in two colors, but if you want white or a nice dark gray, you're in luck.My Sheets Rock the Regulator Sheet Set for $199: These sheets are super soft. They promise to regulate your temperature, but I found myself waking up a little too warm some nights. If you aren't a hot sleeper, these are overall soft, comfortable sheets to sleep on.Pom Pom at Home Bamboo Sateen Sheet Set for $368: These are good bamboo sheets, but for the price, we were more impressed by others we tested.Quince Linen Bamboo Bundle for $255: This set would have been a pick if it were still available. It's a fantastic combination of linen and bamboo that gets the best of both worlds: the softness and cool touch of bamboo with the structure and airflow of linen. It's a great pick for hot sleepers—if it resurfaces, buy it!Quince Bamboo Sheet Set for $130: Quince makes some solid sheets, and these bamboo ones are super soft. They're a little heavy for me as a hot sleeper, but otherwise come in a nice range of colors and have an Oeko-Tex certification, meaning no harmful chemicals were used. Quince also says the bamboo is organic, but there aren't any certifications to confirm that (more below on our thoughts on organic bamboo bedding).Sunday Citizen Bamboo Sheet Set for $109: WIRED reviewer Louryn Strampe found these sheets to be super soft and fantastic to sleep on. But even with the claimed deep pockets, they tended to pop off her mattress, and other picks like Luxome's sheets feature straps that will avoid that problem.FAQsWhat Types of Bamboo Are There?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronThere's a few different terms you might see when describing the bamboo fibers that make up a set of bamboo sheets. Bamboo isn't naturally a soft fiber, so it goes through a harsh chemical process to break it down and turn it into fibers that can be woven into sheets. Each different name lets you know what kind of process was used and what kind of chemicals (and chemical off-put) were involved.Bamboo rayon and bamboo viscose are sometimes used interchangeably, though they shouldn't be since they aren't exactly the same. Rayon is likely a term you've seen before, since it's a general term used for fabric made from regenerated cellulose. Bamboo rayon usually suggests that it's semi-synthetic and might not be 100 percent bamboo. Meanwhile, bamboo viscose also uses bamboo cellulose as its base, though it has a slightly different process. Viscose is another type that isn't limited to bamboo. Just about every sheet I've tested claims to be 100 percent bamboo viscose.Bamboo lyocell is the best of the three, because lyocell has a closed-loop process, which means that almost all of the chemicals used to make more lyocell get reused rather than dumped. Lyocell is a fantastic-quality fabric that makes for a great cooling sheet, so it's a term to look for if you want to stay cool while you sleep.Are Bamboo Sheets Cooling?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWhile bamboo is absolutely cool to the touch when you first climb into bed, I often find that bamboo bed sheets can warm up quite a bit throughout the night. Some companies claim that the bamboo fibers can help regulate your temperature and wick away moisture. As a hot sleeper, I haven't found this true with every set of bamboo sheets. Some have a weave that’s too heavy to keep me cool on hot nights, since no amount of promised moisture-wicking can replace good airflow to keep you cool. There are a few sets of bamboo bed sheets I recommend below that keep me cooler than others, but I recommend visiting our guide to the Best Cooling Sheets if you want to consider all kinds of bed sheets that could keep you cool, from bamboo to cotton percale and even sheets with phase-change material (or PCM) blended in.Can Bamboo Sheets Be Organic?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronUnlike cotton fabrics, which have the Global Organic Textiles Standard, or GOTS, there's no overarching certification to verify if bamboo is organically sourced. Many sheet makers will say the bamboo is organic, but with no main certification to confirm this, it's hard to say without a doubt that any bamboo sheets are fully organic.Instead, you'll usually see Oeko-Tex certifications, which confirm that no harmful substances were used, and sometimes you'll see Forest Stewardship Council, or FSC, certifications, which confirm that the bamboo was sustainably sourced. Hopefully a primary bamboo organic certification will come out in the future to better inform bamboo textile shoppers. You can learn more about existing organic certifications in our guide here.Does Thread Count Matter?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronBamboo sheets have a thread count, just like cotton sheets, describing how many threads are in a square inch of the fabric. You don't want too high of a thread count—anything over 800 is purely marketing-speak, and higher thread counts can mean shorter, lower-quality fibers. It's better to have fewer fibers that are longer and stronger.Bamboo made into rayon, viscose, and lyocell can be manipulated into a long thread more easily than cotton, of course, so we haven't seen the crazy-high thread counts listed on bamboo sheets. Many of these sheets are also a sateen weave, which is a three-over-one thread style, leading it to feel softer but not be as breathable. It's not always so simple as sateen will make you hot, of course; our favorite cooling bamboo sheets from Ettitude have a sateen weave, so it depends on several factors.The takeaway? Don't worry about thread count. Focus on type of weave and reviews (like ours!) to get a better idea of whether a set of bamboo sheets (or any other kind of sheet) will suit your sleep needs.How Does WIRED Test Bamboo Sheets?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronFor our bamboo sheets guide, I compared our picks both overnight and side by side for softness, cooling properties, and price. Each set of sheets was slept on anywhere between two and seven nights, depending on how it performed, and was washed multiple times to check for pilling or design flaws. I'm a hot sleeper living in Southern California, with my bedroom on the third floor of my home, so it's been easy to discover if sheets can't keep me cool all night long. I also looked at each sheet's quality in reference to the price to see what sheet sets were really worth investing in after testing each one.How Does WIRED Obtain Sheet Samples? What Happens to Samples After Testing?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronAll sheets in this guide were obtained as testing samples from companies. We obtain these sheets with no obligation to cover or promises for what coverage could look like. When testing is complete, the top picks are held onto for long-term testing, while the rest are donated locally.Power up with unlimited access to WIRED.
