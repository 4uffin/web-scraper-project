The best fitness tracker should be comfortable, attractive, and tailored to your lifestyle, including your preferred workout times and methods. Do you bike, row, or do strength training? Do you run on trails for hours at a time, or do you just want a reminder to stand up every hour? Do you want to wear it on your wrist, your finger, or tuck it into your bra?No matter what your needs are, there’s never been a better time to find a powerful, sophisticated tool that can help you optimize your workouts or jump-start your routine. We test dozens of fitness trackers every year while running, climbing, hiking, or just doing workout videos on our iPads at night, to bring you these picks.Our top pick has consistently been the affordable, versatile Fitbit Charge 6 ($150) or the Garmin Vivoactive 6 ($300), both of which work well with Android and iOS. Don't see anything you like? Don't forget to check out our other fitness and health guides, like the Best Smartwatches, Best Sleep Trackers, and Best Heart Rate Monitors.Updated September 2025: We've added the new Apple Watches, Garmin Venu X1, and Coros Nomad.Next UpAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWe are testing the Amazfit T-Rex 3 Pro ($400), the Garmin Fenix 8 Pro ($2,000), and the Nowatch B ($399).Best OverallCourtesy of FitbitFitbitCharge 6$160 $120 (25% off) Amazon$150 $114 (24% off) Walmart$160 $120 (25% off) Google StoreEven as Fitbit has faced stiff competition from other manufacturers—most notably, the Apple Watch—its trackers have always won me over. They hit a very specific sweet spot between attractiveness, affordability, accessibility, and ease of use. They're perfect for everyone who isn't an ultra-marathoner or a semipro powerlifter trying to hit a PR, and Fitbits are compatible with iOS and Android.The Fitbit Charge 6 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) now has many integrations from Google, Fitbit's parent company. The redesigned app looks much more modern and is much better organized. You can now get directions from Google Maps, pay with Google Wallet, and control your music with a YouTube Music Premium subscription. You can also check your skin temperature and 24/7 heart rate readings, take ECGs, and track your activities and sleep schedule in the newly Google-fied app. The battery charge lasted well over a week, and the physical button is back, baby! Finally, this comes in a package that costs $160 (though it's often on sale).Last summer, Fitbit also rolled out several updates. Improvements to the algorithm now mean that the heart rate tracking is more accurate; it can also auto-detect more sports, like the elliptical and spinning, and the GPS accuracy has improved. Many of its best features are still locked behind its $10/month Fitbit Premium subscription. But if all you want is a basic fitness tracker that won't break the bank, the Charge only costs $160. Read our Best Fitbits guide for more options.SpecsBattery lifeUp to 7 daysWater resistance5 ATM (can be submerged up to 50 meters)Incident detectionNoBlood oxygen monitoringYesRunner-UpPhotograph: Adrienne SoGarminVivoactive 6$300 Garmin$300 Amazon$300 REIGarmin also makes wonderful, accurate fitness trackers that work well with iOS and Android. This year's Vivoactive 6 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is the latest, midrange addition to Garmin's lifestyle Vivoactive line. While the Amazfit Active 2 below is equally beautiful, the Vivoactive 6 is accurate as well as attractive, and draws upon the predictive powers of Garmin's many proprietary algorithms like Morning Report and Body Battery.It has onboard satellite connectivity so it doesn't need to be tethered to your phone, and a bright AMOLED display that lets you see your stats, unlike Garmin's entry-level Vivomove line. It also has blood oxygen monitoring in addition to sleep tracking, heart rate measurements, and incident detection to tell your emergency contacts if you fall. Garmin also recently launched a subscription service, Connect+, which is $70 per year and gets you features like live tracking on compatible smartphones (similar to what you'd get with an Apple Watch) as well as Garmin's AI-powered Active Intelligence. One of the biggest pluses with a Garmin is that its Connect software has always been free, and my experience with Connect+ is that you can do without it. However, I will say that it's the only AI-powered fitness service that I've tried so far that gave me useful insights, like telling me that I need to get my nighttime scaries under control when I'm sleeping.SpecsBattery lifeUp to 11 daysWater resistance5 ATMIncident detectionYesBlood oxygen monitoringYesBest Smart RingPhotograph: Simon HillPhotograph: Simon HillChevronChevronOuraRing 4$349 Oura$349 Best Buy$399 AmazonI wear an Oura Ring 4 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) constantly. The latest version has new colors and a wider range of sizes, and the sensors are recessed inside the body of the ring to make it thinner and lighter. The sensors are also placed asymmetrically and, combined with a new Smart Sensing algorithm, continuously adapt to taking the best measurement at any given time, no matter what's going on with your hands. (No, don't tell me.)While the Garmin Fenix 8 is one of the best fitness trackers on the market, the Oura Ring caught a night of insomnia and several more hikes per day. The battery life is also better than the last Oura Ring, and the app is easy to navigate. The experimental Oura Labs feature lets the company continuously test new features that end up making their way into the app permanently, like Symptom Radar, which tracks metrics like resting heart rate and temperature trends to let you know if you've started exhibiting cold- or flu-like symptoms. The company is continually updating its software, such as its integration with the Dexcom Stelo (see below). Now I can layer my glucose measurements in Oura's Timeline feature to see how my activity level and meals reduce my glucose readings.The best features are still paywalled behind the $6/month Oura membership. Non-paying members are stuck with the basics: Sleep, Readiness, and Activity scores, as well as the Explore content, which includes meditation videos and advice clips that I have mostly found useless.SpecsBattery lifeUp to 8 daysWater resistance10 ATMIncident detectionNoBlood oxygen monitoringYesA Screenless BandPhotograph: Adrienne SoPhotograph: Adrienne SoPhotograph: Adrienne SoChevronChevronWhoopMG Fitness Band$199 Whoop (One)$239 Whoop (Peak)$359 Whoop (Life)Whoop's business model is unique. If you commit to a year-long subscription fee for the price of a regular fitness tracker, the company throws in the sensor for free. (You have to buy the additional Whoop Body garments yourself.) The company recently updated the wearable to the new Whoop 5.0 and the Whoop MG (8/10, WIRED Recommends); both are smaller and more energy-efficient, and the Whoop MG has ECG capabilities and the ability to take your blood pressure via a proprietary algorithm—a feature which even the Apple Watch has yet to offer.Whoop has taken several measures to make its biometrics more appealing to everyday users, as well as performance athletes. For example, it now counts your steps in addition to its proprietary Strain algorithm, which now takes into account muscular as well as cardiovascular effort. There are also new Healthspan and Pace of Aging features, which let you see how the decisions you make will increase your lifespan (theoretically). It's worth noting that Whoop membership now has three tiers and that to get the new Healthspan, ECG, and blood pressure capabilities, you have to pay for the highest Whoop Life tier at $359/year. However, that is what the original $30/month Whoop membership cost, and Whoop throws in the updated Whoop MG for free.I tested the Whoop MG with the Whoop Life membership. Blood pressure readings have to be calibrated with a separate cuff, but Whoop's algorithm appears to be in line with the cuff's readings. The Whoop MG is noticeably smaller than the Whoop 4.0. It's screenless and works when slipped into my clothes. All that is to say, the new Whoop offers many more useful features for basically the same price, and besides the new Apple Watch, it is the only wrist-worn tracker to currently offer blood pressure readings (for now).SpecsBattery lifeUp to 14 daysWater resistanceRated IP68Incident detectionNoBlood oxygen monitoringYesBest Continuous Glucose MonitorPhotograph: SteloDexcomStelo$99 Amazon$99 SteloNo tracker I've tested has generated as much interest as a continuous glucose monitor (CGM). It's a small, Bluetooth-enabled sensor with a tiny needle that slides under your skin. When you click it onto your arm with the included dispenser, it feels like getting flicked with a finger. It doesn't hurt while you're wearing it, but it does fall off and needs to be replaced every two weeks. These were originally approved for use by diabetics, but are now approved to be sold commercially.I also tested the Abbott Lingo, but I like the Dexcom Stelo better. The dispenser is easier to use, the application process is friendlier and more secure, and the app is simpler—no proprietary metrics to confuse you. Dexcom also has partnerships with both Oura and Apple, so your glucose data can seamlessly integrate with your other trackers. The app sends you a glucose spike alert every time you've stressed your body out by eating too much sugar or carbs instead of protein and fiber. A 2018 Stanford study also showed that many people have prolonged blood sugar spikes and don't know it, which can lead to cardiovascular disease and other bad outcomes down the road. I find it a little difficult, mentally and emotionally, to monitor my food intake this closely. If you're prediabetic or a pro athlete who wants to optimize their fueling, you've probably been waiting for a good commercially available CGM for some time. Now it's here.SpecsBattery lifeUp to 14 daysWater resistanceWaterproof up to 8 feet deepIncident detectionNoBlood oxygen monitoringNoThe Best Outdoors WatchPhotograph: Adrienne SoGarminFenix 8 AMOLED$1,000 Garmin$975 Amazon$1,100 REINote: We are currently testing Garmin's Fenix 8 Pro model that has satellite communications, which I think is a big enough update that you should consider purchasing it instead. We will update this roundup when we have tested.Garmin has combined features from its previous Epix and Fenix lines back into the Fenix 8 AMOLED. You get the updated, hugely bright AMOLED screen of the Epix with the much longer battery life of the Fenix (longer than two weeks for the 47-mm model, in my testing). It also comes in the Fenix E version ($800), which is cheaper and has a less-bright MIP display. Now there's also dynamic routing, which lets you enter how far you want to go into the watch, and then it will route you home on time. This is why you buy a Garmin outdoors watch—so you can figure out where you are and find your way home.This is the best outdoor sports watch money can buy. It's compatible with both Android phones and iPhones, and the screen is ridiculously bright—not that it gets super sunny in Oregon in the winter, but it's noticeably brighter outdoors than other Garmin displays. You get everything you need for almost every sport, most notably Garmin's proprietary off-grid maps, which include SkiView for ski resort maps and golf course maps. There are leakproof buttons for scuba and a microphone and speaker for voice commands when you're off-grid. There's a built-in flashlight! No more relying on a phone flashlight with a 17 percent battery when you're out hiking later than you expected.Garmin Connect is included with the purchase of the watch, which means that you won't have to pay a subscription fee to use its best features, which now include suggested strength-training workouts if you've also recently become obsessed with weight lifting to prevent you from disintegrating into a bag of dust. The one thing I found in my testing is that it's less sensitive in sleep tracking and incidental activity tracking than my Oura ring. This is less useful if you want just an everyday fitness tracker. But if you love outdoor sports, there's none better.SpecsBattery lifeUp to 10 daysWater resistance10 ATMIncident detectionYesBlood oxygen monitoringYesBest Running WatchPhotograph: Brent RosePhotograph: Brent RosePhotograph: Brent RosePhotograph: Brent RoseChevronChevronGarminForerunner 970$748 Amazon$750 REI$750 Best BuyThe Garmin Forerunner 970 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is the latest, high-end iteration of Garmin's storied running line. It has the biggest, brightest, shiniest AMOLED screen; two weeks of battery life; the best training algorithms and suggestions; and fun extras, like an in-device flashlight and a speaker and mic for using voice commands.New training features include your Running Tolerance score, which uses your Acute Impact Load to measure not just how far you ran, but how hard the run felt. It also has Step Speed Loss and Running Economy to help you run more efficiently, although it also needs the new HRM 600 ($170) to measure these. It also has map and navigational features that have been cribbed from the Fenix line, like Round Trip Routing, that will help you plan routes and get you back to your starting point. Garmin also released the new midrange Forerunner 570 ($550) this year, which is cheaper but also has shorter battery life, less-premium materials (Gorilla Glass 3 vs. Sapphire, aluminum bezel vs. titanium), less memory at 8 GB vs. 32 GB, no built-in mapping, and no flashlight. It's also worth noting here that Garmin Forerunners age very well, and older models are frequently on sale.SpecsBattery lifeUp to 15 daysWater resistance5 ATMIncident detectionYesBlood oxygen monitoringYesBest If You Have an iPhonePhotograph: Adrienne SoPhotograph: Adrienne SoPhotograph: Adrienne SoChevronChevronAppleWatch Series 11$399 Amazon$399 Best Buy$399 AppleEvery year, I say you don't have to buy the latest Apple Watch if you already have one. This year's Series 11 is the first exception, because after years of struggling to upgrade the Apple Watch's battery life, it finally has a full 24 hours. That means you can wear it to sleep without waking up with a drained watch. Going from 15–18 hours of wear to the full 24 hours means you can also use it to track sleep. In accordance with that, Apple now has a brand-new (and perhaps overly generous) Sleep Score that takes into account bedtime, duration, and interruptions. It's a lot less comprehensive than many other sleep trackers, but if tracking your sleep makes you anxious, maybe that's all for the best.The standout feature this year is hypertension notifications, which have been FDA-cleared and clinically validated; over 30 days, the Health app will ping you if it sees signs of high blood pressure. It has the same slim case and fast charging as last year's Series 10, and it's also compatible with WatchOS 26, which means you'll get the overly eager personalized advice of your very own AI-powered Workout Buddy. Also, blood oxygen sensing is back, baby! WatchOS 26 does mean, however, that you'll get a lot of these features (including hypertension and blood oxygen sensing) on last year's Series 10, but don't buy it if it's not significantly under MSRP.SpecsBattery life24 hoursWater resistance5 ATMIncident detectionYesBlood oxygen monitoringYesBest If You Have an Android PhonePhotograph: Julian ChokkattuPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuChevronChevronGooglePixel Watch 4$350 Amazon (41 mm)$400 Amazon (45 mm)$350 Best Buy$350 Google StoreThe Google Pixel Watch 4 will not go on sale until October, but it was announced in August. It's hard to recommend the Pixel Watch 3 considering the upcoming model fixes one of its biggest problems: repairability. The Pixel Watch 4 will be fully repairable, which will extend the watch's lifespan. Google will even sell replacement parts on iFixit so you can fix it yourself.It will also have a longer battery life than the Pixel Watch 3, a new charger, and the screen is 50 percent brighter. New health features include better sleep tracking with machine learning, better skin temperature sensing, dual-frequency GPS for better live activity tracking, and fresh exercise options like pickleball and basketball. While it is technically the first smartwatch with SOS satellite communications for emergencies, Apple's Watch Ultra 3 is the first one on sale, but we're looking forward to testing it when it's available.SpecsBattery lifeUp to 30 hoursWater resistance5 ATMIncident detectionYesBlood oxygen monitoringYesBest Cheap TrackerPhotograph: Adrienne SoAmazfitActive 2$100 Amazfit$100 $90 (10% off) AmazonThe Amazfit Active 2 packs a ton of functionality in a tracker that is only $100. It has the usual bevy of sensors (photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor, accelerometer, gyroscope, barometric altimeter, ambient light, and temperature sensors) that do all the usual things, like track your sleep, heart rate, and blood oxygen saturation. It also has up to 164 workout modes and long battery life, all in an attractive, stainless steel case rated for 5 ATM water resistance. I jumped into pools and hot tubs wearing it without any damage.It also has other features that are startling at this price, like mapping on the large, bright AMOLED touchscreen. You can download maps—even ski resort maps—to get directions. Amazfit has partnerships with trendy fitness and wellness companies like Hyrox, the current CrossFit competitor, and Wild.AI, which lets women optimize their workouts according to their menstrual cycles. OK, not all of these features work exactly as promised. The watch did not auto-recognize my strength training exercises, the sleep tracking was not nearly as sensitive as my Oura ring, and the map put a river next to my house where there is a street. Still, these don't seem like problems that will be that difficult to iron out. This watch made me rethink the value proposition of fitness trackers entirely. Did I mention it costs $100?SpecsBattery lifeUp to 10 daysWater resistance5 ATMIncident detectionNoBlood oxygen monitoringYesBest for KidsPhotograph: Adrienne SoFitbitAce LTE$180 $140 (22% off) Amazon$180 $140 (22% off) Best BuyThe Fitbit Ace LTE (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is the first fitness tracker I've gotten my kids to wear consistently. (They used to wear Apple Watches, but found it difficult to keep them charged.) The Ace is a combination fitness tracker, gaming device, and location tracker that has been incredibly useful and fun for both me and my children as they've moved from camp to lesson to pool to neighbor's house this summer.It has the full suite of Fitbit's health sensors, so it can track my kids' step count and make sure they're not spending too much time in front of the TV. The $10/monthly subscription pays for both LTE connectivity—so you don't have to add a line to your cell phone plan—as well as Fitbit Arcade, which has a plethora of fun, time-limited, movement-based games that incentivize my children to keep their watches on. They can call and text me (sometimes too often) and other approved contacts through the Fitbit Ace app, and I can also see their location via Google Find My to make sure they made it back home from a field trip. This has made our summer so much easier. Its childlike aesthetic is probably not going to appeal to kids older than 11, though.SpecsBattery life16+ hoursWater resistance5 ATMIncident detectionNo, but does have Call for Help featureBlood oxygen monitoringNoBest for Samsung OwnersPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuPhotograph: Adrienne SoPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuPhotograph: Adrienne SoChevronChevronSamsungGalaxy Watch8 and Watch8 Classic$350 $330 (6% off) Amazon (40 mm)$380 $360 (5% off) Amazon (44 mm)$500 $470 (6% off) Amazon (Classic)$350 $330 (6% off) SamsungIf you own a Samsung phone and a Samsung Galaxy ring, you should also own a Samsung Galaxy Watch8. The ring and watch share health monitoring tasks when worn together, which extends the battery life considerably. The new standout features for the Watch8 include Samsung's new “squircle” design (what the company is calling a “cushion” design) and a bevy of new health features.Vascular Load and Antioxidant Index join the AGEs index in offering different metrics to look at your health. Samsung says Vascular Load measures the load on your vascular system (your blood vessels that carry blood throughout your body), which will help you gauge whether habits like drinking alcohol or eating a lot of sodium are affecting your long-term health risk. Unfortunately, neither Julian nor I got actionable results. While in theory, Antioxidant Index seems like a good way to judge if you're eating enough vegetables, the results were so off-base that it made me laugh. The watch told me my Antioxidant Index was low, and I need to eat more canned pumpkin puree. That's despite living in Portland, Oregon, at the height of fruiting season, and snacking on fresh berries and plums on every dog walk. The watch is beautiful and easier to use than ever, but the new health features definitely need some work.SpecsBattery lifeUp to 30 hoursWater resistance5 ATM, IP68Incident detectionYesBlood oxygen monitoringYesBest AnalogCourtesy of WithingsWithingsScanWatch 2$370 Withings$370 Amazon$370 Best BuyDo you want a tracker that doesn’t look like a tracker at all? Then you want the Withings ScanWatch 2 (7/10, WIRED Recommends). We loved the original ScanWatch (and the Withings Steel before that). This version includes everything we love, including comfort, good looks, long battery life, and a comprehensive suite of health features. It also includes temperature tracking, a new charger, and an unfortunate and unpalatable price hike.My colleague Simon Hill found the health features comprehensive and generally accurate, including the new temperature tracker. (I tested it as well and found that it wasn't quite sensitive enough to predict my menstrual cycle with the accuracy of the Oura Ring.) One of the most touted new features is Withings' new Cardio Check-Up. Withings' board of certified cardiologists will review ECG data from your watch and send you a medical review of your cardiac health directly through the app. Like many of Withings' best features, Cardio Check-Up is locked behind a $10/month subscription.If this sounds a bit too pricey for you, you may want to consider the ScanWatch Light ($250), which doesn't have the ECG, irregular heart rate warnings, blood oxygen, or temperature tracking but costs $120 less.SpecsBattery lifeUp to 30 daysWater resistance5 ATMIncident detectionNoBlood oxygen monitoringYesBest Heart Rate MonitorPhotograph: Polar ElectroPolarH10$105 Amazon$105 PolarMost fitness trackers have a built-in heart rate monitor, but if you're engaging in long sessions of intense aerobic activity, you'll get greater accuracy if you use a separate strap on your bicep or around your chest. Of the heart rate monitors we tested, my colleague Michael Sawh likes Polar's the best. Polar replaced the typical loop-and-hook connector with a much more comfortable buckle connector, along with small silicone dots to make sure the monitor stays in place.Comfort and security mean that the readings are much more accurate; Sawh saw (hah!) no drop-outs or underreporting or overreporting of data. It also has built-in memory and ANT+ connectivity, so you can connect to other equipment like bike trainers. You also don't have to replace the battery for up to a year.SpecsBattery lifeUp to 400 hoursWater resistanceWaterproofIncident detectionNoBlood oxygen monitoringNoOther Fitness Trackers to ConsiderPhotograph: Adrienne SoGarmin Instinct 3 for $400: Garmin's Instinct line doesn't have as many high-end features as the Fenix 8, but it's popular because it's cheaper and it has a cool, chunky retro aesthetic that I love. This year's updates include the built-in flashlight and a new reinforced bezel, which is good considering that I still managed to bang up the Fenix and Epix watches quite a bit. For more information, check out our guide to the Best Garmin Watches.Coros Nomad for $349: After wearing it for a month during the summer, I really love this rugged, modestly priced sports watch. It's meant for anglers, so most of its sport modes are for fishing, but there's also a new feature called Adventure Journal that lets you record voice memos and pin locations as you're hiking and running so that you can remember where bathrooms, campsites, or really great berry-picking spots are. It's very light, considering its size, and the battery lasts forever.Apple Watch Ultra 2 for $649: I don't recommend last year's Watch Ultra 2 anymore because I think the vastly extended battery life (up to 42 hours from 36 hours) plus satellite communications is enough of a reason for any outdoorsperson to just get a Watch Ultra 3. You definitely shouldn't buy it at full price. But it is compatible with watchOS 26, so if you can find it significantly on sale, I won't think you're dumb for going for it.Garmin Venu X1 for $800: Garmin's Venu line straddles an odd niche. It has a polymer case, a nylon strap, and an enormous AMOLED display that is 2 inches across, which is great for displaying built-in maps. It has speakers and a mic for taking calls, and much of the fitness functionality of the Fenix, but without the classy, durable metal bezel or insane battery life. It works fine; it's just hard to look at it and not think that it's plastic and costs twice as much as the Apple Watch.Photograph:
Julian ChokkattuOnePlus Watch 3 for $270: My kingdom for a smartwatch that can last more than a day! The OnePlus Watch 3 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) can last for five days on a single charge. OnePlus now includes many by-now standard health features, like fall detection, a skin temperature sensor, irregular heart rate notifications, and an electrocardiogram. This is another great pick if you want a smartwatch that's also a good fitness tracker.Suunto Run for $249: I love how light and slim this watch is (36 grams), especially in the now sold-out Lime. It has a bright AMOLED screen, two weeks of battery life, and accurate dual-frequency satellites. But Suunto's software is clunky and difficult to navigate when compared to Garmin's, Coros's, or Apple's. Offline maps are also not supported.Amazfit Bip 6 for $70: Amazfit's trackers are improving so quickly! Like the Active 2, the Bip 6 is a gorgeous little watch, with a brilliant, big, and responsive AMOLED screen, well over a week of battery life, and 140 sport modes. I still find the tracker and the Zepp app to occasionally be laughably inaccurate, but it's cheap and comfortable and works well. However, for only $20 more, I'd just get the Active 2 instead.Xiaomi Smart Band 9 for $59: I was shocked by how much I liked this affordable little fitness band. The 1,200-nit display is clear and bright, and the touchscreen is responsive. The aluminum case feels sturdy, and it tracks your steps and heart rate with reasonable accuracy. However, there's just no comparing the user experience of the Mi Fitness app versus Fitbit's, especially at this price. (Yet.)Photograph: Julian ChokkattuSamsung Galaxy Watch Ultra for $500: Your eyes have not deceived you. Samsung's Galaxy Watch Ultra (7/10, WIRED Review) is a direct rip-off of the Apple Watch Ultra, but for Samsung phone owners. It even has the Quick button (which Apple calls an Action button) and the Double Pinch feature (which Apple calls Double Tap). Apple's watch is better, with more sports, a better interface, and better comprehensive algorithms like Training Load and Vitals. However, what the Galaxy Watch Ultra does, it does well, and Samsung has the resources to catch up quickly. It has a sapphire glass face that's rated to 10 ATM, an IP68 rating, and the ability to withstand elevations as high as 9,000 meters and temperatures as high as 130 degrees. It also has backcountry navigation features, dual-band GPS, a compass, and breadcrumb navigation, which Samsung calls Track Back and which Apple calls Backtrack (this is getting silly). The battery life is still just an adequate two days and change, though. This is the 2025 model, which added more storage and a new color, but you can buy the 2024 model for even less.Buyer BewareAmazfit Balance
Photograph: AmazonEvie Movano Ring for $269: Evie announced an upgraded version of the Movano, with a medical-journal-trained AI chatbot and improved sleep and heart rate tracking. I tested it and unfortunately did not find enough on offer to rescind my previous opinion (4/10, WIRED Review). The smart ring market has exploded since then, and many new rings have explicitly women-centered features. It simply doesn't offer enough features to be an attractive product right now.Amazfit T-Rex 3 for $280, Amazfit Helio Ring for $149, and Amazfit Balance for $150: I have tried all the older watches across Amazfit's lineup, and my colleague Simon Hill has tried the company's smart ring. While I have nothing to complain about regarding the build quality, the Balance is a dupe for the Samsung Galaxy Watch if you don't look too hard—both Hill and I found functionality somewhat limited and were exasperated at the subscription upselling. The Active 2 is the only Amazfit watch I like right now.Compare Top 14 Fitness TrackersDeviceWIREDTIREDBattery lifeWater ResistanceIncident detectionBlood Oxygen MonitoringFitbit Charge 6Attractive.

I'm less concerned with whether a fitness tracker can replicate every feature on your smartphone than if the suite of health features is robust and accurate; if it can track multiple activities; and if it stays on and is secure while doing multiple fitness activities. We also include fitness trackers that aren't wrist wearables, which includes the Whoop, smart rings, heart rate monitors, and blood sugar monitors.Some wrist-based fitness trackers will feature the ability to read emails and control music, but the screens are often smaller and less bright. However, the battery life is often much better, which makes a difference, especially if you're tracking your sleep over time. If, however, you're more interested in the option to access apps without having to pull out your phone, you might want to think about getting a smartwatch. (If you want no notifications at all, get a smart ring instead.) Don't see anything that's exactly your style here? Check out our Best Smartwatches guide.My Tracker Doesn't Work! What Should I Do?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronHere are just a few ways you can easily cure what ails you (or your device):Make sure it fits. Optical sensors won't work if your device is slipping loosely around your wrist. You can customize most devices with new straps. Make sure it sits securely an inch above your wrist.Wash it! I'm horrified by how many people tell me their fitness trackers are giving them a wrist rash. Wipe it down with a little dish soap and water after a sweaty session.Get out from under tree cover. Does your device utilize multiple satellite positioning systems to track your location when you're starting an outdoor workout? This is a lot harder for it to do if you're under power lines, trees, or even (gulp) inside.Set a routine. There's nothing quite as frustrating as opening your tracker's app and finding out that it ran out of battery before you went to bed last night. Keep your app updated regularly. Check if your tracker is connected to your phone, and keep chargers everywhere.Does My Strap Have PFAS?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronA study published in December 2024 found that many smartwatch wrist bands contain high levels of PFHxA, which is a “forever chemical” that can affect your immune, thyroid, kidney, and reproductive systems. How do you know if your band has PFHxA?Check if the band is labeled as being made of “fluoroelastomer.” Fluorinated synthetic rubber is the material that has the highest levels of PFHxA.Check if the company has tested its products. For example, Garmin's watches do not have PFAS.If you're not certain, most trackers let you swap out your bands for those made from silicone, metal, leather, or other materials. Companies often have their own proprietary accessories; if you need some ideas on what to look for, check out our Best Apple Watch Accessories guide.Power up with unlimited access to WIRED.
