Whether you’re a videophile or new to 4K, the best TVs you can buy are bigger, brighter, and cheaper than ever. To help you navigate the dozens of models from LG, Samsung, TCL, Hisense, Sony, Panasonic, and others, we've done intensive testing and watched hundreds of hours of content to grab the standouts from our recent reviews. Below you'll find everything from the best OLED TVs we've ever tested to the best cheap TVs for tight budgets—with plenty of excellent options in between.All these models have a minimum 4K Ultra HD resolution with HDR (one has 8K), because there's no good reason to buy a standard HDTV beyond a pint-size model for your kitchen or bedroom. Every TV on our list comes with a wonderful display, but most are bad at sound and can have lackluster interfaces, so you should consider investing in a good soundbar or a pair of bookshelf speakers and a streaming stick to fill out your home theater. If you're unfamiliar with TV lingo, check out our tips below.Updated August 2025: We've added the TCL QM8K, the Hisense U8QG, and Samsung's The Frame Pro.Buy by BrandAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronIf a TV isn't made by LG, Samsung, Sony, Hisense, TCL, Vizio, Roku, or Panasonic (which recently returned to the States), make sure you've done your research. These are our favorite TV brands at the moment. A cheap set might look enticing for the price, but try to avoid dirt-cheap models from brands like Sceptre, which may not offer good picture quality or a durable build.If your budget doesn’t extend to a new model from the above brands, we recommend looking into last year's TVs sold at steep discounts and often offering only modest differences. You could also look at factory-refurbished options, but these are obviously less reliable. Read our How to Buy a TV guide to learn more about the terms you'll come across when shopping for a screen, and other helpful advice.Helpful DefinitionsAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronBuying a new TV requires navigating a sea of lingo, so let's quickly define the key terms. You can also read more about these terms in our guides on How to Buy a TV and How to Setup your TV.4K or Ultra HD refers to television resolution with four times as many pixels (points of light) as a traditional HDTV.8K displays have four times the pixels of 4K, but most buyers can ignore 8K for the foreseeable future. 8K sets are still very expensive, and the availability of 8K content hasn't made any notable strides.HDR stands for High Dynamic Range, and all modern 4K TVs have it. A TV with HDR technology has better contrast (brighter brights, darker darks) and more voluminous color than older TVs with SDR (Standard Dynamic Range). The three main versions of HDR to know are HDR10, HDR10+, and Dolby Vision. Most TVs support HDR10 and Dolby Vision, while some models support HDR10+, a Dolby Vision alternative. Samsung TVs do not support Dolby Vision.Full-array backlighting means there is a grid of LED lights behind the TV screen, instead of it being lit by lights on the edges.Local dimming is enabled by full-array backlighting. It means the TV tries to intelligently lower the LED backlights in small areas of your screen where a scene is darker and brighten them in light spots. TVs with mini LED backlighting generally offer the best local dimming (more on that below).LED vs LCD: There was a time when these terms could be considered separate, as some early LCD TVs did not use LEDs for backlighting, but they are now essentially interchangeable. Any non-OLED TV right now uses a combination of an LCD panel and LED illumination to create a picture.OLED TVs use an entirely different technology than LED TVs, able to light up or turn off each tiny pixel independently. That gives OLEDs improved contrast with deeper blacks than LED TVs for a more immersive picture. OLED TVs also have much less trouble providing good off-angle viewing than LED TVs, and the best models can now get as bright as many premium QLED TVs. Image retention, aka burn-in, was once a major concern for OLED displays but now barely factors in for all but the most extreme high-volume users, and even then it usually isn't permanent.QLED TVs are backlit LED TVs that employ quantum dots, tiny particles that create brighter and better colors when illuminated. QLED might look like OLED in print, but QLED is not the same technology and generally isn't as highly praised as OLED. QLED TVs look better than TVs without quantum dots, and the best ones get brighter than all but the best OLEDs, but they still fall behind OLED TVs when it comes to contrast, black levels, and viewing angle.mini LED TVs are almost universally quantum-dot enabled, so they can also be considered QLEDs. A QLED with mini LEDs implies (but doesn't guarantee) better picture quality than QLEDs without, since mini LEDs are smaller to allow for more dimming zones for better control and deeper back levels than regular LEDs.QD-OLED TVs use newer panels made by Samsung that add quantum dots to improve brightness and aid the color performance of a traditional OLED screen.120 Hz means a TV's display refreshes at up to 120 frames per second, producing significantly smoother onscreen action than you'll get with lower-quality 60-Hz panels. This is great for gaming and watching sports, but otherwise, you won't notice much of a difference, as most films and TV shows are designed to be shown at lower frame rates. Some TVs push this further to 144 Hz or 165 Hz when connecting a supported gaming PC.Best TV for Most PeoplePhotograph: Ryan WaniataTCLQM6K QLED$598 $550 (8% off) Amazon$748 $648 (13% off) Walmart$730 $650 (11% off) TCL$750 $650 (13% off) Best BuyThe TCL QM6K shies away from the brightness one-upmanship of midrange rivals for a more balanced approach. As the lead-off display in TCL’s new Precise Dimming series, the QM6K (8/10, WIRED Recommends) employs a new Halo Control system designed to reduce light bloom, alongside multiple other new technologies to improve color accuracy, screen uniformity, and contrast. The result is an incredibly versatile display that does just about everything well, from naturalistic colors to rich black levels and impressive clarity.The QM6K isn’t as bright as our previous pick, the Hisense U7N, but it still packs a punch for HDR and Dolby Vision. Along with its new screen tech, the TV gets a stout gaming update for 2025, including a loaded gaming bar, a high-refresh screen with VRR (Variable Refresh Rate) at up to 144 Hz, and TCL's “Zero-Delay Transient Response” for low-lag gaming. It’s all controlled by a handy Google TV smart interface for a package aimed to please just about anyone, especially now that it's often on sale.SpecsDisplay typeQLED/mini LEDRefresh RateNative 120 Hz (up to 4K@144Hz)HDR SupportDolby Vision, HDR10/10+, HLGConnections/GamingHDMI 2.0 (x2), HDMI 2.1 (x2); VRR, ALLMSmartsGoogle TVBest Premium TVPhotograph: Ryan WaniataPhotograph: Ryan WaniataPhotograph: Ryan WaniataPhotograph: Ryan WaniataChevronChevronLGG5 OLED$3,400 $2,800 (18% off) Amazon$3,400 $2,997 (12% off) Walmart$3,400 $3,000 (12% off) LGLG’s G5 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) offers the best all-around experience for high-end buyers. You'll find immaculate black levels and shadow detail, pristine picture processing, and vivid yet accurate colors for incredible realism. The pièce de résistance is breakthrough brightness from its new four-stack panel that finally brings OLED on par with premium QLED TVs, matched by striking glare reduction for stellar performance in any light.The TV pairs its superb picture quality with advanced features like VRR gaming at up to 165 Hz and Xbox Cloud streaming for an overall experience worthy of its premium price. While some reviewers noted some HDR10 issues early on, we didn't see any after the latest firmware updates. A few quibbles like a minor loss of off-angle color accuracy and some webOS streaming flubs are the only points keeping the latest flagship LG OLED from a perfect 10/10. —Ryan WaniataSpecsDisplay typeOLEDRefresh Rate120 Hz (up to 4K@165 Hz)HDR SupportDolby Vision, HDR10, HLG,Connections/GamingHDMI 2.1 (x4); VRR, ALLMSmartsLG webOSBest Cheap TVPhotograph: Parker HallVizio4K TV (V4K55M-0801)$328 $264 (20% off) Walmart$329 $265 (19% off) TargetThis cheap TV from Vizio supports Dolby Vision and has an easy-to-use interface that allows flawless app casting from Android and iOS. It's hilariously cheap for these features; a 55-inch model will set you back around $300, making it one of the best budget buys we've tested. You can choose from a ton of sizes, ranging from a 48-inch guest-room TV to an 85-incher for the living room.You'll miss out on deep black levels, because this TV doesn't have the fancy mini-LED or OLED panels you'll find on other picks on this list, but at this price you can't really complain. These TVs look shockingly good for the money and can even game at 120 frames per second in 1080p with motion enhancement, which is all that anyone really needs for most consoles. —Parker HallSpecsDisplay typeLEDRefresh Rate60 HzHDR SupportDolby Vision, HDR10/10+, HLGConnections/GamingHDMI 2.0 (x3), VRR, ALLMSmartsVizio SmartCastBest OLED TV for MostPhotograph: Parker HallLGC4 OLED$1,397 Amazon$1,497 $1,397 (7% off) WalmartLG's C4 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) sits a tier below flagship OLEDs to pair a luxe experience with serious value, especially at current sale pricing now that the updated LG C5 is available (testing coming soon). This slim-bezeled OLED offers impressive OLED brightness and color, with support for Dolby Vision that Samsung's rival S90 TV series notably lacks.I love the magic remote, which is like a Wii remote for your TV that lets you point and click at what you want on screen (it's really awesome for making picture changes or logging in to your myriad streaming accounts). Couple that with support for Google Chromecast and Apple AirPlay for easy casting from your cell phone, plus the ability to do 4K at up to 144 Hz across all four inputs while gaming, and you have yourself a brilliant centerpiece for your fancy modern living room. —Parker HallSpecsDisplay typeOLEDRefresh Rate120 Hz (up to 4K@144 Hz)HDR SupportDolby Vision, HDR10, HLGConnections/GamingHDMI 2.1 (x4), VRR, ALLMSmartsLG webOSBest Bright-Room TVPhotograph: Parker HallPhotograph: Parker HallPhotograph: Parker HallChevronChevronTCLQM8K QLED$1,798 $998 (44% off) Walmart$1,800 $1,298 (28% off) AmazonWe expected the TCL QM8K (9/10, WIRED Recommends) to be good, but even we were surprised at how brilliantly this TV performed. With next-gen brightness that meets or beats any TV we've tested (and do we mean bright!), you'll get great performance even in sunny rooms, alongside rich contrast, deep black levels, and colors that reviewer Parker Hall called “near-perfect.”It’s all set in a virtually bezelless floating screen, looking every bit like a flagship model from premium brands, with better sound than most. You’ll find every major flavor of HDR and great gaming features for the money, including dual HDMI 2.1 ports for features like VRR and up to a 144-Hz refresh rate. If you’re after a premium experience in a bright room (or any room), TCL's latest top-tier screen will take you there. —Ryan WaniataSpecsDisplay typeQLED/mini LEDRefresh Rate120 Hz (up to 4K@144 Hz)HDR SupportDolby Vision, HDR10/10+, HLGConnections/GamingHDMI 2.1 (x2), HDMI 2.0 (x2); VRR, ALLMSmartsGoogle TVMost Immersive PicturePhotograph: Ryan WaniataPhotograph: Ryan WaniataPhotograph: Ryan WaniataPhotograph: Ryan WaniataChevronChevronSonyBravia 8 II QD-OLED$3,500 $3,098 (11% off) Amazon$4,000 $2,998 (25% off) WalmartSony's top OLED for 2025 once again transfixed me with its beautifully immersive picture. Replacing the bewitching A95L (9/10, WIRED Recommends), the oddly dubbed Bravia 8 II (9/10, WIRED Recommends) adds some sweet new skills, including higher HDR brightness courtesy of Samsung's most advanced QD-OLED panel yet.This TV is a dazzler, mixing natural yet vivid colors, near-perfect screen uniformity, and perhaps the best picture processing I've ever evaluated, rendering 4K and even HD scenes so clearly you'll feel like they're going to spill into your living room. Lighter black levels and lower peak brightness than the knockout LG G5 are its only real downsides, along with Sony's miserly distribution of just two full-bandwidth HDMI ports. Otherwise, this is a regal experience with a kingly cost. —Ryan WaniataSpecsDisplay typeQD-OLEDRefresh Rate120 HzHDR SupportDolby Vision, HDR10, HLGConnections/GamingHDMI 2.1 (x2), HDMI 2.0 (x2); VRR, ALLMSmartsGoogle TVA Great All-Around OLEDPhotograph: Ryan WaniataPanasonicZ95A OLED$2,000 Amazon$3,200 $2,000 (38% off) PanasonicSometimes you get a TV that hits all the right notes from the moment it glows. Panasonic’s new Z95A OLED (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is that TV. With a meticulously tuned version of LG Display’s MLA (Microlens Array) OLED panel at its core, this TV is fabulously bright, offset by fantastic shadow detail, excellent reflection handling, and the perfect black levels for which OLEDs are praised. Details are crisp, with excellent upscaling, while the colors are rich, deep, and natural. It all adds up to one of the best TVs I’ve laid eyes on. If that weren’t enough, it loads up every major flavor of HDR and the best built-in sound you can buy (though it does make the build bulky).One notable drawback is its subpar Fire TV operating system—I don’t love the layout, and apps are sometimes slow to load. We'll see if that's improved, as we'll be testing the latest model Panasonic Z95B shortly. Regardless, the Z95A is still a killer buy, especially at super-sale pricing while stock lasts. Like Sony’s current crop of premium TVs, it has just two HDMI 2.1 inputs for the latest game consoles, one of which is the eARC input for an audio system. With sound this good, you may not need one anyway, and the rest of the package is so stellar I could barely get this thing off my console. —Ryan WaniataSpecsDisplay typeOLEDRefresh Rate120 Hz (up to 4K@144 Hz)HDR SupportDolby Vision, HDR10/10+, HLGConnections/GamingHDMI 2.1 (x2), HDMI 2.0 (x2); VRR, ALLMSmartsAmazon Fire TVBest QLED TVPhotograph: Ryan WaniataSonyBravia 9 QLED$3,000 $2,798 (7% off) Amazon$2,998 $2,798 (7% off) Walmart$3,000 $2,800 (7% off) Best BuyYou may think your current TV is bright enough, but Sony’s masterful Bravia 9 QLED TV (9/10, WIRED Recommends) begs to differ. Its powerful mini LED backlighting system is impressively punchy, while maintaining excellent black levels and contrast. Add in Sony's excellent picture processing for vivid detail and vibrant yet restrained quantum dot colors, and you get a stunningly realistic viewing experience across content.Restraint is key to the Bravia 9’s success. Its blazing backlight is judiciously distributed for exhilarating highlights and full-picture punch without the eye-blasting overload of cheaper brightness powerhouses. Off-axis viewing is also impressive for an LED TV, though the trade-off is some screen rainbowing with direct reflections. Sony TVs continue to skimp on HDMI 2.1 support, with only two of the flagship's four HDMI ports providing modern features like 4K gaming at 120 Hz. Those knocks aside, this TV is a modern QLED marvel (with a price tag to match). —Ryan WaniataSpecsDisplay typeQLED/mini LEDRefresh Rate120 HzHDR SupportDolby Vision, HDR10, HLGConnections/GamingHDMI 2.1 (x2), HDMI 2.0 (x2); VRR, ALLMSmartsGoogle TVAnother Great QLED TVPhotograph: Ryan WaniataSamsungQN90D QLED$1,798 Amazon$1,798 $1,498 (17% off) Walmart$1,800 $1,500 (17% off) Best Buy$1,800 $1,500 (17% off) SamsungThe Samsung QN90D (8/10, WIRED Recommends) isn't the brightest TV in its class, but its still-fiery mini LED backlight system outshines similarly priced OLEDs, combining with its stealthy anti-reflection tech for fabulous performance in the full light of day. It adds rich and natural colors, crisp picture processing, and oily black levels for a brilliant way to waste a good Sunday watching football or baseball, especially now that its price has dropped dramatically.The QN90D's standout motion response makes it great for gaming, as do extras like VRR (variable refresh rate) at up to 144 Hz across all inputs and a dedicated Game Hub. It's not all gravy, as the TV sometimes reveals light bloom in the dark and over-sharpened artifacts with lower-quality content. Its off-axis viewing is better than most QLED TVs, but not as good as OLEDs, and Samsung obstinately omits Dolby Vision. Still, with the QN90F priced much higher at present (testing forthcoming), the QN90D's premium picture and bright-room brilliance make it a top pick for the right space. —Ryan WaniataSpecsDisplay typeQLED/mini LEDRefresh Rate120 Hz (up to 4K@144 Hz)HDR SupportHDR10/10+, HLGConnections/GamingHDMI 2.1 (x4), VRR, ALLMSmartsSamsung TizenBest Gaming TVPhotograph: Ryan WaniataSamsungS90D QD-OLED$1,698 $1,398 (18% off) Amazon$1,600 $1,398 (13% off) Walmart$1,600 $1,400 (13% off) Best BuySamsung has refreshed its 2025 lineup with the S90F, but the S90D (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is still one of the baddest TVs you can buy. Its OLED display provides incredible contrast thanks to fabulous black levels and great brightness for an OLED, while the use of quantum dots (available in the 55-, 65-, and 77-inch models) brings intense yet natural colors.Its gaming bona fides include 144-Hz refresh rate support across all inputs, VRR, and built-in cloud gaming for Xbox, Luna, and others. It looks excellent in game mode by default. Gaming aside, I loved everything I watched on this TV, from 4K HDR Blu-rays to the 2024 Olympics. While it doesn’t offer Dolby Vision HDR support (Samsung opts for HDR10+ instead), the S90D is otherwise a premium screen that's now priced below many midrange options. —Ryan WaniataSpecsDisplay typeQD-OLEDRefresh Rate120 Hz (up to 4K@144 Hz)HDR SupportHDR10/10+, HLGConnections/GamingHDMI 2.1 (x4); VRR, ALLMSmartsSamsung TizenBest OLED for Direct ReflectionsPhotograph: Ryan WaniataSamsungS95D QD-OLED$2,398 Amazon$4,400 $2,498 (43% off) Walmart$2,800 $2,380 (15% off) Best BuySamsung's S95C QD-OLED TV (8/10, WIRED Recommends) offered phenomenal brightness for an OLED TV, and generally incredible picture quality bolstered by great features and design. In 2024, Samsung took an even bigger swing with the S95D (8/10, WIRED Recommends), adding an anti-reflective screen coating for class-leading glare resistance. Even direct lighting from inches away is dissipated with surprising efficacy.The trade-off is that the S95D tends to lose some perceived depth in direct lighting, as the black backdrop swaps obsidian gloss for a duller coating. This is really only noticeable with very dark backgrounds in bright rooms, but it could be a reason for some Samsung fans to consider the step-down S90D (9/10, WIRED Recommends). That said, the S95D looks fantastic day or night, with great contrast and impressive brightness. Add in great features and stylish design, and you've got a killer QD-OLED for tough lighting that's all the more enticing now that it's often on sale for hundreds less. –Ryan Waniata(Note: There's a newer version of this TV, the S95F, currently in our testing queue, that uses Samsung's latest panel for increased brightness and an updated matte backdrop.)SpecsDisplay typeQD-OLEDRefresh Rate120 Hz (up to 4K@144 Hz)HDR SupportHDR10/10+, HLGConnections/GamingHDMI 2.1 (x4); VRR, ALLMSmartsSamsung TizenBest 8K TVPhotograph: SamsungSamsungQN900C$1,995 AmazonAs we've noted in previous coverage, 8K TVs are a tough sell since 8K content is still scarce and the files are enormous. Luckily, Samsung's 8K TVs do a swell job upscaling 4K video, which is especially handy for larger screen sizes. Samsung's bright and beautiful QN900C (8/10, WIRED Recommends) comes in sizes ranging from 65-85 inches, and 65-inch TVs are the smallest 8K models you'll likely find. The TV's 33 million pixels are matched by fabulous picture processing, potent brightness, and vibrant colors. It all adds up to showy spectacle that's tough to rival.The QN900C is our current go-to model, not because it's the latest version, but because its sale price is much more affordable than new models. Even as the QN900F arrives, I recommend most 8K adopters go for the cheaper (and larger) QN900C while available. After all, the larger the TV, the better you can enjoy 8K's improved pixel density. Along with its sparkling 8K resolution, the QN900C is loaded with options like Samsung's pedestal-style floating-screen design and tons of gaming features for a top-tier experience. —Ryan WaniataSpecsDisplay typeQLED/mini LEDRefresh Rate120 Hz (up to 4K@144Hz)HDR SupportHDR10/10+, HLGConnections/GamingHDMI 2.1 (x4); VRR, ALLMSmartsSamsung TizenHonorable MentionsThere are so many good TVs available, we can't add them all to our top list. Here are some great options that either missed the cut or got knocked off our top list by their replacements.Hisense U8QG: The U8QG (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is a great buy at its lowest price (around $1,000 for a 65-inch model) and a solid pick above that price, especially if you want eye-searing brightness above all else. I noticed some SDR color accuracy issues (some images looked way too red) and found it difficult to keep it from wildly over-brightening some content. Thankfully, you can always turn it down, and its nuclear power plant is paired with excellent black levels, deep contrast, and plenty of features. I actually prefer last year's similarly punchy U8N (8/10, WIRED Recommends), but it's getting harder to find in stock.TCL QM7K (2025): I’ve had a love/hate relationship with the QM7K. Part of TCL's new Precise Dimming series, its opulent black levels and contrast reach toward OLED heights, matched by good brightness for some spectacular moments. The problem? My review model’s colors were off-kilter, with an odd green tint in select black and grayscale content. Thankfully, I confirmed that TCL's latest firmware update fixed the issue. The TV's picture processing and colors still don't catch premium TVs, and this is the second year in a row I've found a troubling performance issue with the QM7. You shouldn't buy it at full price, but if you can get the 65-inch model for $1,000 or less, it's an enticing choice.Hisense U7N: If you’re after a TV at similar pricing to the QM6K but with some extra eye tingle, last year's Hisense U7N (8/10, WIRED Recommends) offers a serious brightness boost over our top pick and still ranks among our favorite options for your money. Its blooming control and screen uniformity aren’t as refined as the QM6K's but it’s got plenty of features, including great gaming credentials and a streamlined Google TV interface. It's still a great buy while stock lasts, especially at $700 or less.Sony A95L: Sony finally replaced this sweet screen with the 2025 Bravia 8 II, which offers similarly incredible picture processing and upscaling alongside enhanced colors and higher HDR brightness. That shouldn't deter you from considering the A95L (9/10, WIRED Recommends) at a lower price. With fabulously immersive image quality and an intuitive Google TV interface, this is a premium package that's very enticing on a good sale.Sony Bravia 7: The Bravia 7 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is a gorgeous display, offering brilliant brightness, naturalistic colors, and suave finesse in the subtle details. Its biggest knock is very poor off-axis viewing, which could be tough to swallow at its high list price. Otherwise, it's worth considering for fans of that Sony glow, especially since Sony seems to be discounting its best QLED TVs much more liberally than its OLED models.Other TVs We've TestedSamsung The Frame Pro: I put the Frame Pro through our full review process and came away both in limbo due to software issues and (so far) unimpressed with the performance. The matte screen looks slick when displaying art, especially if you purchase one of the add-on frames (a frame for the Frame?) from Samsung or Deco TV Frames. Picture performance was otherwise middling at best. It's much brighter than the traditional Frame and the colors pop, but its edge-lit mini LED system does not look good with dark 4K HDR content, even in the day. Moreover, I had trouble with its very sluggish operating system (which others have reported) and stuttering Blu-ray playback. We're awaiting a second model, which we hope relieves the software issues, but steer clear for now.TCL QM7: There's only one thing holding back 2024's beautifully balanced QM7 (6/10, WIRED Reviewed): a software glitch. During my review, I experienced an issue where adjusting SDR backlight levels affected HDR, which can lead to severe brightness limitations. While TCL fixed the issue in a firmware update for me, I never got confirmation on a broader OTA fix. Most folks probably won't have this issue, so the QM7 is still worth considering, but make sure and check it before throwing out the box.Power up with unlimited access to WIRED.
