It can also elevate your outfit and make you feel good. The best smartwatches can do even more, from tracking your workouts and heart rate to serving notifications and accessing voice assistants. While wearing a connected watch, you can leave your phone in your pocket and use your wrist for simple tasks.The Apple Watch Series 11 is my favorite for iPhone owners, but Google’s upcoming Pixel Watch 4 is most likely the best smartwatch for Android users. I also like several other options—in various styles and with different levels of smarts. Below is a roundup of the best smartwatches I’ve tested. Looking for a fitness tracker or smart ring instead? There's plenty more in our Best Apple Watch Accessories, Best Fitness Trackers, Best Smart Rings, and Best Cheap Watches guides.Updated September 2025: We’ve added the latest Apple Watches and mentioned the Google Pixel Watch 4.Fitness Trackers vs. Smartwatches vs. Smart RingsAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronSmartwatches typically replicate many of the functions found in your smartphone via apps—you can control smart home functions, start conversations via WhatsApp, respond to Slack messages, and call up smart assistants like Siri or Gemini to ask almost anything. This is in conjunction with the standard health and fitness tracking features, plus a more familiar touchscreen interface. However, the downside is the battery life typically lasts a day or two, if not a little more.Fitness trackers, on the other hand, aren't as feature-rich. You typically won't be able to access many other apps. There's the basic ability to read emails and texts, control music playback, or even access tap-to-pay features, but you're generally more restricted. They deliver the same if not better health- and fitness-tracking capabilities (depending on the model) than smartwatches. Battery life is where fitness trackers win out, typically lasting days if not a week. If battery life and fitness and health are top of mind, get a fitness tracker. (Read our Best Fitness Trackers guide for options.) But if you want rich notifications, the ability to respond to them, and the option to access apps without having to pull out your phone, a smartwatch is the better pick.Smart rings are the least functional of the lot but they trade versatility for battery life. Devices like the Oura Ring and Ultrahuman Ring Air can last close to a week while still tracking your heart rate and sleep, though few are successful at automatic workout tracking. You might not wear a fitness tracker and a smartwatch, but you totally can and might want to wear a smartwatch and a smart ring. The two complement each other well, and some devices, like Samsung's Galaxy Ring and Galaxy Watch8, can work with each other to extend battery life, passing off duties from ring to watch and vice versa. Read our Best Smart Rings guide for recommendations.Swap Your StrapsAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronPhotograph: Natalya Trofimchuk/Getty ImagesYou don't need to stick with the strap you get in the box! Every smartwatch has straps that can easily be swapped out. Apple Watches, Google's Pixel Watch, and Samsung's latest Galaxy Watches have a proprietary strap system, but analog watch straps will work for others, making your options nearly endless. All you need to do is figure out the strap size of your smartwatch and whether or not they're proprietary. You can usually find this on the back of the strap r itself (you'll see “20 mm” or just “22”), or you can check the manual or the website you purchased the watch from. It's an easy way to further match your timepiece to your look.PFAS in Smartwatch StrapsAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronA study published in December of 2024 found that many smartwatches and fitness trackers that come with “fluoroelastomer” straps—synthetic rubber—had “high concentrations” of perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHx4), a type of polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS), which is considered a “forever chemical” that can cause immune, thyroid, kidney, and reproductive health problems. The study notes that there's limited knowledge about the absorption of these chemicals into the skin.The researchers tested bands from various brands, including Apple, Casetify, Fitbit, Google, and Samsung. If you're worried, steer clear of bands made from fluoroelastomer (often listed in the product description, but not always). That includes Apple's Sport Bands and Google's Active Band, to name a few. Opt for other materials instead, like silicone, metal, or leather.Best Smartwatch for iPhonePhotograph: Adrienne SoPhotograph: Adrienne SoPhotograph: Adrienne SoChevronChevronAppleWatch Series 11$399 Amazon$399 Best Buy$399 AppleLike clockwork, there's a new Apple Watch. The Series 11 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is the top smartwatch for iPhone owners, mixing a nice blend of features for a reasonable price. That includes arguably the most important upgrade: all-day battery life. No, really, Apple has finally upgraded the 18-hour runtime to a full 24 hours, and that's a game-changer. Now you can wear your watch to bed and track your sleep knowing it won't die in the middle of the night.The second most notable addition is hypertension notifications. The CDC says nearly half the US adult population has high blood pressure, which increases the risk of a stroke or heart disease. You shouldn't use the Series 11 to diagnose hypertension, but you can double-check your results with your physician if there are trouble signs. It's FDA-cleared, and you'll need to wear the watch for 14 days before it starts delivering alerts. Apple has also added a Sleep Score that rates your sleep, and blood oxygen is officially back.It's worth noting that the older Series 10 can also take advantage of some of these new features via a software update, including hypertension notifications and Sleep Score, so if you can find it on sale, it might be worth snagging it instead of the latest and greatest. However, a full 24 hours of battery life might trump everything else. Read our Best Apple Watch guide for more.SpecsCase size: 42 mm or 46 mmCompatibility: iOSConnectivity: Cellular and Bluetooth/Wi-Fi optionsStraps: ProprietaryTop health features: Hypertension notifications, heart-rate tracking, irregular heart rate notifications, sleep apnea notifications, blood oxygen sensing, skin temperature sensing, electrocardiogram, sleep tracking, cycle tracking, fall detection, crash detectionGoogle's Next Pixel WatchPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuChevronChevronGooglePixel Watch 4$350 Amazon (41 mm)$400 Amazon (45 mm)$350 Best Buy$350 Google StoreI have not yet reviewed the new Google Pixel Watch 4, which was announced at Google's hardware event in August. The latest model goes on sale on October 9, but I don't think you should buy the Pixel Watch 3 at this point unless you can find it at a dramatically lower price. The main reason? None of Google's previous smartwatches is repairable. If you plan to hold onto your watch for several years, that's important. Good news, though, the Pixel Watch 4 changes all of that. We got an exclusive teardown that shows just how easy it is to replace the screen and battery, two of the most common repairs on a smartwatch. Google will even sell parts on iFixit so you can repair it yourself.Other improvements to the watch include 25 percent longer battery life, a new dock-style charger, and a domed display with slimmer bezels to take advantage of the domed glass. It's 50 percent brighter than its predecessor, has a stronger haptic engine for better vibrations, and you can raise the watch to your face to talk to the Gemini voice assistant. It is technically the first smartwatch announced with SOS satellite communications for emergencies, but Apple brought this feature to market first with the new Apple Watch Ultra 3. There's also dual-frequency GPS for more accurate route tracking. On the health side of things, sleep tracking has been upgraded and can better classify your sleep cycles, and a next-gen skin temperature sensor can help detect if you might be under the weather.I'll be testing the Pixel Watch 4 soon, so stay tuned for our review.SpecsCase size: 41 mm or 45 mmCompatibility: AndroidConnectivity: Cellular and Bluetooth/Wi-Fi optionsStraps: ProprietaryTop health features: Heart-rate tracking, loss of pulse alerts, irregular heart rate notifications, blood oxygen sensing, skin temperature sensing, electrocardiogram, sleep tracking, cycle tracking, fall detection, crash detectionAn Affordable Apple WatchPhotograph: Adrienne SoAppleWatch SE 3$249 Amazon$249 Best Buy$249 AppleIf you have an iPhone and don't think you need all the bells and whistles on the health front, but most importantly, you don't want to drop $400 on a smartwatch, you'll be happy with the new Apple Watch SE 3. It's a nice upgrade if you're coming from an older model, and also makes a great watch for your parents or kids. It has the same S10 chip as the Series 11 and Watch Ultra 3, but Apple has limited the features to lower the price. The bezels around the screen are chunkier, and battery life is also restricted to the usual 18 hours.It's not particularly exciting, but at $249, you're still getting a heck of a smartwatch that can enjoy many of the new features in watchOS 26, like Workout Buddy, Sleep Score, and the wrist flick gesture to dismiss calls, notifications, and timers.SpecsCase size: 40 mm or 44 mmCompatibility: iOSConnectivity: Cellular and Bluetooth/Wi-Fi optionsStraps: ProprietaryTop health features: Heart-rate tracking, irregular heart rate notifications, sleep apnea notifications, skin temperature sensing, sleep tracking, cycle tracking, fall detection, crash detectionBest for Samsung LoyalistsPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuPhotograph: Adrienne SoPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuPhotograph: Adrienne SoChevronChevronSamsungGalaxy Watch8 and Watch8 Classic$350 $330 (6% off) Amazon (40 mm)$380 $360 (5% off) Amazon (44 mm)$500 $470 (6% off) Amazon (Classic)$350 $330 (6% off) SamsungAnyone with a Samsung phone will be best served with Samsung's Galaxy Watch8 series (6/10, WIRED Review). I'm not a fan of the new squircle design (or the new proprietary straps), but it runs the latest Wear OS 6, and there are several nice improvements to the interface that make everything more glanceable. (There's now access to the Gemini assistant, too!)Within the Galaxy Watch8 series, there are three watches: a 40 and 44 mm model, and the Watch8 Classic, which is 46 mm and sports Samsung's iconic mechanical rotating bezel—you can physically rotate the bezel to scroll through the interface. My colleague Adrienne So tested the tiniest Watch8 and saw disappointing battery life, but things fared much better for me on the Classic; I hit close to two full days on a single charge. I recommend going for the 44-mm or the Classic.Samsung's health- and fitness-tracking features are spot-on here, with reliable heart rate measurements, solid sleep tracking, and dual-frequency GPS for accurate mapping. The automatic workout detection is also among the best. However, newer health features are of dubious helpfulness. The AGEs index, which Samsung introduced in 2024, still doesn't offer much information, and the Bedtime Guidance is hidden away in a settings menu. New is the Antioxidant Index, which measures carotenoids in your blood to ensure you're eating healthy, but Adrienne, who has a diet filled with antioxidant-rich berries and fruits, found it completely inaccurate.Vascular Load is new in the Watch8 series, and it measures the load on your vascular system (your blood vessels carrying blood throughout your body). It takes time to set up—you need to wear it three out of the last 14 days to get a result—and your watch needs to maintain proper skin contact during sleep. When it does work, it's a nice metric to be able to see (at least, it's nice to know that my vascular load is “steady”). Outside of that, it's hard to gauge what helpful information the watch will provide if it isn't steady. Right now, it just says to get plenty of sleep and physical activity, which, duh.There's a lot to like with the Galaxy Watch8 series, but take some of these health features with a grain of salt. You should also remember that some features are limited to Samsung phones only, like the electrocardiogram and sleep apnea tracking.SpecsCase size: 40 mm or 44 mm | Classic is 46 mmCompatibility: Android, some features exclusive to Samsung phonesConnectivity: Cellular and Bluetooth/Wi-Fi optionsStraps: ProprietaryTop health features: Heart-rate tracking, irregular heart rate notifications, blood oxygen sensing, sleep apnea notifications, skin temperature sensing, sleep tracking, electrocardiogram, cycle tracking, fall detectionBest for iPhone Weekend WarriorsPhotograph: Adrienne SoAppleWatch Ultra 3$799 Amazon$799 Best Buy$799 AppleLike the Apple Watch Series 11, the Watch Ultra 3 now has longer battery life—up to 42 hours on full power. My colleague, Adrienne So, tested it and says she was able to wear it for a full weekend of navigation, activity tracking, and satellite messaging. That last feature is brand-new and exclusive to the Watch Ultra 3: you can send texts to friends and family in areas without reception, provided you're in a clear area with line of sight to a satellite, and call emergency servicesOtherwise, this is the same Ultra smartwatch as before, one that is more rugged and durable than the standard Apple Watch. It now has the biggest display available on the Apple Watch, which makes it better for viewing offline maps, and well as the same three-mic array and dual speakers that showed up on previous Watch Ultras. Also as with previous Watch Ultras, you can dive with it. The bigger and thicker case size is overkill for some, but if you're in the great outdoors often and you want the best battery life on an Apple Watch, this is it.SpecsCase size: 49 mmCompatibility: iOSConnectivity: Cellular and Bluetooth/Wi-Fi optionsStrap: ProprietaryTop health features: Hypertension notifications, heart-rate tracking, irregular heart rate notifications, sleep apnea notifications, blood oxygen sensing, skin temperature sensing, electrocardiogram, sleep tracking, cycle tracking, fall detection, crash detectionBest Battery LifePhotograph:

The OnePlus Watch 3 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) has a fantastic five-day battery life. It's not a small watch, but it's not terribly thick. It employs a new silicon-carbon battery technology that can fit a denser 631-mAh cell without requiring a thicker body. This, paired with OnePlus' dual-engine architecture that debuted on last year's OnePlus Watch 2, allows the smartwatch to sip the battery—I lost only 25 percent per day for five days wearing the Watch 3, which was amazing.This is a Wear OS smartwatch, so you get all the bells and whistles including taking calls, talking to Google Assistant, and responding to notifications from all your apps. OnePlus has ramped up its health and fitness offerings this go-around, improving the heart rate monitor's accuracy thanks to better sensor placement and build materials, plus a bevy of new features, including fall detection, irregular heart rate notifications, and wrist skin temperature sensing. There's also an electrocardiogram, but it's unavailable in the US and Canada. Still, the company has made strides here. It might not be my first choice if I wanted a health- and fitness-focused watch, but it delivers reliable results without needing to be charged every day, and that's more helpful than a dead smartwatch.For folks who may find the 47-mm size comically huge on their wrist, OnePlus offers a smaller 43-mm OnePlus Watch 3. I wore it for several weeks, even to bed, and found it immensely comfy. The lugs slope down nicely, and the silicone 18-mm strap is soft on the skin. It's slim, yet the 1.32-inch screen doesn't feel small. I tracked my health after a week of traveling in London, and my sleep and activity data were spot on. It’s too bad battery life isn’t as notable, though still excellent for a smartwatch of its size. I routinely got close to two days out of this smaller watch with multiple tracked activities. If you're not tracking a ton of workouts, it'll probably last two and a half days on a single charge.SpecsCase size: 43 mm or 47 mmCompatibility: AndroidConnectivity: Bluetooth/Wi-FiStraps: 22 mm quick release for 47 mm | 18-mm quick release for 43 mmTop health features: Heart-rate tracking, irregular heart rate notifications, blood oxygen sensing, skin temperature sensing, sleep tracking, cycle tracking, fall detectionBest Fitness WatchPhotograph: Adrienne SoGarminVivoactive 6$300 Garmin$300 Amazon$300 REIFitness watches are typically not as sleek or simple to operate as more robust smartwatches, but the Garmin Vivoactive 6 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) bucks that trend. WIRED editor Adrienne So enjoyed the bevy of proprietary Garmin metrics on this fitness watch, from Body Battery to Training Readiness. There's a built-in GPS, a heart-rate monitor, blood oxygen measurements, a sleep tracker, incident detection for personal safety, and 80 activity profiles to track workouts. Oh, and the watch lasted around a week on a single charge.On the smartwatch end, you can pair it with iOS or Android to see your notifications, but only Android users can respond to texts with the on-screen keyboard. You won't be able to access third-party apps, though. There's also Garmin Pay, so you can leave the wallet and phone at home and still check out at Starbucks on your way back from a run.

That's why we’re more comfortable recommending the Fitbit Ace LTE (8/10, WIRED Recommends). Google-owned Fitbit promises not to store children's health data for research, and it will delete location history after 24 hours and all health data after 30 days. This watch requires a subscription to Fitbit Ace ($10 per month), but that includes cellular connectivity, so you don't need to add it to your carrier's cellular plan. You can set contacts, and your kids can make phone calls and texts through the watch to the Fitbit Ace app, and they can share their location via Google Maps.Fitbit is bringing the gamified fitness tracking experience that adults are used to for kids with Fitbit Arcade, and there's even a Tamagotchi-like virtual character (Eejie) your kids can take care of. These games are time-based, so your kids can hit their activity goals by completing them. Parental controls let you set limits, like School Time, which locks down many of the watch's features. It's a great way for your kid to go out and be independent, while also giving you the peace of mind of knowing how to reach and find them, without the problems that come with giving them a smartphone at such a young age.SpecsCase size: 40 mmCompatibility: iOS and AndroidConnectivity: Cellular plan required, Bluetooth/Wi-FiStraps: ProprietaryTop health features: Activity tracking, heart-rate trackingBest Barely Smart WatchPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuCasioPro Trek PRG-340B$290 Amazon$290 CasioI thoroughly enjoyed wearing this Casio watch—designed for the outdoors—in decidedly non-outdoor conditions for several months. From the green case to the plant-derived Castlon green strap, it looks smart and works with various outfits, even for city slickers. I largely relied on it for timekeeping (in several time zones) and the stopwatch during workouts, but you can also monitor barometric pressure, altitude, and temperature, plus check the compass to get your bearings. The LCD is easy to read, and I like the auto LED function that lights up the screen when you tilt the watch. Best of all, this is a Tough Solar watch, so you won't have to bother with a charging cable.It might not do heart rate and notifications, but the small feature set makes this Casio useful and slightly smarter than your average timepiece.SpecsCase size: 54 mmCompatibility: NoneConnectivity: NoneStraps: 23-mm quick-releaseTop health features: NoneThe Calculator WatchPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuCasioCA53W-1CR Calculator Watch$30 Amazon$27 Walmart$30 CasioIt's a calculator … on a watch. How much smarter can you get? Seriously, the buttons might be tiny, but you can calculate how much your tip will be when grabbing the bill at the restaurant, and everyone will marvel at your brilliance. This cheapo watch from Casio is a classic—it's comfy and lightweight—and you can cycle through a few modes, including a stopwatch, an alarm, and a second time zone. There's a five-year battery life, and the fully automatic calendar goes through the year 2099 (that's 15 battery changes).If you're interested in non-smart watches, check out our Best Cheap Watches Under $1,000 guide.SpecsCase size: 43 mmCompatibility: NoneConnectivity: NoneStrap: 20-mm quick releaseTop health features: NoneOther Smartwatches to ConsiderThe number of smartwatches on the market is staggering. I’ve tested models from Tag Heuer, Citizen, Montblanc, and many other fashion brands, but most of them are simply too expensive for what you get. Here are a few options I like.Apple Watch Series 10
Photograph: Adrienne SoApple Watch Series 10 for $364: Thanks to watchOS 26, the 2024 Series 10 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) has many of the same features as the new Series 11, like hypertension notifications and Sleep Score. It has a thinner and lighter design with a larger screen than prior models, and it even got blood oxygen sensing back via a software update in August 2025. It's too bad this one still has the 18-hour battery life. Avoid paying anywhere close to MSRP for this watch. If you can find it for under $300, snag it.Google Pixel Watch 3.
Photograph: Julian ChokkattuGoogle Pixel Watch 3 for $299: The Pixel Watch 3 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is seeing some steep discounts now that the Pixel Watch 4 has been announced. It's a great smartwatch, with the caveat that it's not repairable. (The newer model addresses that.) It features loss of pulse detection—cleared by the FDA for use in the US—which can be critical in saving someone’s life. Google also focused its fitness updates on running, enabling users to create custom runs and follow AI-powered run recommendations while getting feedback on cardio load—how hard your heart is working and whether it's appropriate for your body. I strongly recommend you go with the 45-mm model, which doesn't even feel that big. It simply delivers better battery life—just about 24 hours with the always-on display or a little more if you have it turned off.Apple Watch Ultra 2.
Photograph: Julian ChokkattuApple Watch Ultra 2 for $700: The Watch Ultra 2 is still worth considering, just don't pay anywhere near MSRP; otherwise, you may as well buy the new Watch Ultra 3. It can last several days of use, and has many of the same great features as the latest model, including better mics to pick up your voice, an 86-decibel siren to alert your position to anyone nearby, and precise GPS to better track your hikes (plus help you find your way back with the Backtrack feature). The screen can display topographic maps, but you cannot view offline maps without an iPhone.Samsung's Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025.
Photograph: Julian ChokkattuSamsung's Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025 for $650: The 47-mm Galaxy Watch Ultra (7/10, WIRED Review) is the company's Apple Watch Ultra and Garmin competitor, and it's a solid first entry into the world of pricey, feature-rich, and powerful smartwatches designed for professional athletes. This is technically the 2025 model, which is identical to the 2024 version but comes with 64 GB of storage and in a new blue color. It lasts a little over two days on a charge because it's a big 47-mm watch and can pack a beefy battery. There's a titanium case and sapphire glass face, plus it's rated to 10 ATM and IP68, so you can submerge it up to 100 meters underwater. The heart rate tracker is remarkably consistent with the Apple Watch Ultra 2, and the dual-band GPS delivers accurate mapping. The software isn't as intuitive, and a few features are lacking when compared to other performance smartwatches, but this is a good start if you're in the world of Android. If you don't care for the blue or the extra storage, you can buy the 2024 model for hundreds less.Samsung Galaxy Watch7.
Photograph: Julian ChokkattuSamsung Galaxy Watch7 44 mm for $230: Samsung's Galaxy Watch7 from 2024 is a little plain. This model debuted Samsung's Energy Score and added updated sleep tracking capabilities. You also get FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection, though this isn't a feature you'll turn on all the time—it takes two nights to track, and afterward, you'll get a note saying whether or not you show symptoms. This feature, along with the electrocardiogram and irregular heart rhythm notifications, is only available when paired with a Samsung phone. Otherwise, this watch functions well with any other Android. You can choose from two sizes, plus Bluetooth-only or LTE. I tested both sizes and found battery life frustrating compared to its predecessors. With the always-on display, I struggled to hit 24 hours with two tracked activities and sleep tracking overnight. With it turned off, things fared a little better, but I was still barely hitting a full day. You'll have to baby the battery and utilize the power-saving modes. If you don't care for the latest and greatest, you can save a lot of dough with the Watch7.GPR-H1000.
Photograph: Julian ChokkattuCasio G-Shock Master of G Rangeman GPR-H1000 for $500: It's not for every event, but the Master of G-Land Rangeman (GPRH1000RY1A) looks great on my wrist, and I love that I only need to charge it about once a week. This is a G-Shock first and foremost. It has a durable, thick case and a comfortable strap. It's a big watch. It also has six sensors and a built-in GPS. Connect the watch to your smartphone via Casio's app, and you can get simple notification alerts, heart-rate tracking, activity tracking, and sleep tracking. That's without mentioning other features like blood oxygen monitoring, compass, world time, altimeter, and barometer. I've compared the results to an Apple Watch Series 10, and for the most part, core metrics like heart rate, step tracking, and sleep are similar. I have had some data not show up in the Casio app for a few days, and many of these functions are slow to load on the watch. This would not be my first choice if I wanted a fitness-focused wearable—get a Garmin instead—but I like the ability to look at and track some of these metrics whenever I want. More importantly, I like having a G-Shock around my wrist.Samsung Galaxy Watch FE for $250: The Galaxy Watch FE is a fine budget Wear OS smartwatch. The 40-mm Galaxy Watch FE has a smaller screen that doesn't get as bright and sports a slower processor and a smaller battery compared to the Watch7 series. The health sensors are almost the same, and I got accurate results with heart rate and sleep tracking. The battery lasts just about a day, if not a little less.OnePlus Watch 2.
Photograph: Julian ChokkattuOnePlus Watch 2 for $245: This is last year's OnePlus smartwatch, but it's still available. It seems like a better value now that the OnePlus 3's price has been jacked up. The 46-mm OnePlus Watch 2 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) runs Wear OS and lasts roughly three days on a single charge, a little more if you enable some power-saving settings. The health capabilities are lacking—there's no fall detection or electrocardiogram—but there's sleep tracking, and it's pretty accurate. Some features, like heart-rate tracking, distance traveled, and steps, have mixed accuracy in my testing, which means you shouldn't buy this smartwatch if you're primarily using it for those functions. Also, consider the OnePlus Watch 2R, which you can snag for less cash. The differences are mostly around build quality. The screen doesn’t get as bright, it has an aluminum case instead of stainless steel, and there’s no sapphire crystal protecting the screen, so it’s less durable. However, this makes it lighter and more comfortable to wear.Withings ScanWatch 2.
Courtesy of WithingsWithings ScanWatch 2 for $370: The ScanWatch 2 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) can pass for an analog watch. Its health-tracking feature set is comprehensive—you get heart rate monitoring, an electrocardiogram, blood oxygen measurements, and sleep tracking. Battery life is stellar too, as it can last up to 30 days with light use. (Heavier usage will see roughly 22 days before needing a charge.) The main problem is the tiny display on this watch, which is too small to read some notifications. The GPS is also connected, meaning it requires your phone to be tethered and nearby. There's an optional Health+ subscription, but we'd advise against it, as it doesn't offer much utility. The ScanWatch 2 comes in a 42-mm or 38-mm case size and doesn't have the rich features and apps you'll find on the likes of an Apple Watch, but if you want to monitor your health data—and you don't want your watch to look too techy—this will do the job.Power up with unlimited access to WIRED.
