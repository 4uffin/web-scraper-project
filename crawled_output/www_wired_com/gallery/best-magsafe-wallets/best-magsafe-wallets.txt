Apple’s MagSafe technology opens up so many possibilities in the smartphone accessory world, and even more so with the release of Qi2 Android devices. With the built-in magnets, you can attach your iPhone to wireless chargers, car mounts, grips, and even tripods by simply snapping it in place. But wallets may be the most useful MagSafe accessories of them all.The best MagSafe wallets let you attach a sleek, compact, and slim wallet to your iPhone (or MagSafe-compatible case) instead of carrying a bulky, traditional wallet. It's great for anyone who travels light and only carries a few cards at a time. We've tested dozens, and these are the best.Read our MagSafe guides for more, including the Best MagSafe Accessories, Best MagSafe Power Banks, Best MagSafe Wireless Chargers, Best MagSafe Grips, and Best iPhone 17 Cases.Updated September 2025: We've added the SupCase MagFlip and Spigen Valentinus.What Is MagSafe?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronMagSafe is Apple's magnetic technology built into the iPhone 12, iPhone 13, iPhone 14, iPhone 15, iPhone 16, and iPhone 17 ranges (excluding the iPhone 16e). It's comprised of a ring of magnets on the back of the phone, and it was developed to create a faster, more precise wireless charging system. However, magnets on the back also allow you to connect it to different kinds of accessories like external batteries, car mounts, and wallets.If you use a case on your iPhone, you will need to make sure you have a MagSafe case (the case itself will have a ring of magnets inside it). This will ensure a proper connection with MagSafe accessories. If you use a non-MagSafe case, the connection will be very weak, and MagSafe products may just slide off your iPhone. We have lots of case recommendations in our guides:Best iPhone 17 CasesBest iPhone 16 CasesBest iPhone 15 CasesBest iPhone 14 CasesBest iPhone 13 CasesBest iPhone 12 CasesWhen buying a wallet, make sure it supports MagSafe or “Qi2” connections. It should indicate this prominently in the product description. Qi2 is the wireless charging standard, and all MagSafe iPhones support Qi2. Android phones now also support Qi2 and have magnets inside, like the Google Pixel 10 series.MagSafe wallets come with the same ring of magnets that allow them to snap onto the back of the iPhone directly or onto a MagSafe or Qi2 case. This allows the wallet to maintain a strong and secure hold on your device. The wallets we've included in this guide all have the MagSafe seal of approval.Which iPhones Support MagSafe?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronApple first introduced MagSafe for its iPhones in 2020. The following models support the technology:iPhone 12iPhone 12 MiniiPhone 12 ProiPhone 12 Pro MaxiPhone 13iPhone 13 MiniiPhone 13 ProiPhone 13 Pro MaxiPhone 14iPhone 14 MiniiPhone 14 ProiPhone 14 Pro MaxiPhone 15iPhone 15 PlusiPhone 15 ProiPhone 15 Pro MaxiPhone 16iPhone 16 PlusiPhone 16 ProiPhone 16 Pro MaxiPhone 17iPhone 17 ProiPhone 17 Pro MaxiPhone AirDo MagSafe Wallets Work With Android Phones?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronTo use a MagSafe wallet with an Android phone (or the iPhone 16e), you'll need to use a MagSafe case. Many case manufacturers began adding a ring of magnets in Android phone cases to port over the same magnetic experience iPhones natively enjoy. We have case guides for some top phone models with magnetic cases, and they'll work pretty well with third-party MagSage wallets.Best Google Pixel 10 Series CasesBest Samsung Galaxy S25 Series CasesBest Samsung Galaxy S24 Series CasesWe will likely see more Android smartphones with support for Qi2 in 2026. That's the next-gen wireless charging technology. Much of this new standard is modeled after Apple's MagSafe, which means the magnetic charging system will become more widespread. Google's Pixel 10 series devices are the first flagship phones to support Qi2, and expect to see it in nearly every high-end device in the next 12 to 18 months.Will a MagSafe Wallet Demagnetize My Credit Card?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronNo, MagSafe will not demagnetize your credit cards. Credit cards have a strong magnetic stripe encoding that's enough to keep it from being demagnetized, and MagSafe wallets in this guide come with a built-in shield designed to keep your cards safe from this issue. However, you may run into issues with hotel key cards and some gift cards. Keep those away as a precaution.How We Test MagSafe WalletsAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronI use a MagSafe wallet every day as my primary wallet. I check that it snaps onto the iPhone or MagSafe case firmly—and that it doesn't slide off when taking my phone out of my pocket, bag, or jacket. I also make sure the cards fit well into the sleeve and that they don't fall out. I only recommend wallets that feel durable, are easy to use, and can hold the standard amount of cards (two to three).Best MagSafe Wallet OverallPhotograph: Molly HigginsUAGMetropolis Kevlar MagSafe Wallet$60 Amazon$60 WalmartUAG's Metropolis MagSafe wallet is on the spendier side, but you won't be replacing this wallet in a year or two. It is lightweight yet robust with its Kevlar construction. There's a large slot on the back that can hold up to three cards, but you can unfold the wallet and store an additional three cards inside (or cash). This wallet pulls double duty as a stand if you need to prop your phone up, and you can orient your phone in landscape or portrait mode.Material: KevlarCards: Fits up to 6 cardsA Roomy MagSafe WalletPhotograph: Brenda StolyarCourtesy of AmazonChevronChevronCase-MateSoap Bubble Magnetic Wallet for iPhone$30 Amazon$35 $30 (14% off) Case-MateThis might be the most unique MagSafe wallet. It's made of plastic, but it feels durable. When it's not attached to the back of my phone, I tend to throw it in my bag, on the counter, or in a drawer, and it's managed to withstand all of that (and a few accidental drops). The magnets on the back are strong, so I don't have to worry about the wallet falling off my phone case. The best part? It can hold up to five cards simultaneously, plus cash. It also has a snap closure that keeps all the cards securely inside.That said, it's kind of like a coin purse, where everything is a bit loose. That means pulling out a card isn't as seamless as with other MagSafe wallets, because you're fishing for the right one. Since it can hold more, it's not as slim as other MagSafe wallets, which might bother some when holding the phone. I didn't mind it.Material: Thermoplastic polyurethaneCards: Fits 5 cards comfortablyA Wallet With Apple's Find MyPhotograph: Molly HigginsCourtesy of NomadChevronChevronNomadLeather Mag Wallet$85 Nomad$80 VerizonThis luxe, super-thin leather MagSafe wallet from Nomad has Apple’s “Find My” feature built in, so you can easily find it in the Find My app if it’s misplaced. That does mean you need to recharge the wallet, but don't worry, there's no proprietary cable here. Instead, the wallet can be wirelessly recharged on any MagSafe or Qi2 charger; once it's fully recharged, the battery lasts for five months.It's made from vegetable-tanned Horween leather with a polycarbonate frame, and it can hold up to four cards. It looks classy, and it's great for anyone with a tendency to lose things. —Molly HigginsMaterial: LeatherCards: Fits 4 cardsEasiest MagSafe Wallet to UsePhotograph: Brenda StolyarCourtesy of AmazonChevronChevronSmartishSide Hustle Wallet$35 $28 (20% off) Amazon$35 $30 (14% off) SmartishSmartish's MagSafe wallet makes me wish all wallets had a slot on the side to push the cards out. I never had to take it off my phone to access cards. Just give the spacious side opening a little push with your thumb, and the cards will slide out. My cards remained secure, and I never had an issue with them falling out. It's made of vegan leather, and Smartish offers a few fun designs.Material: Vegan leatherCards: Fits 3 cards comfortablyBest DesignsPhotograph: Brenda StolyarCourtesy of CasetifyChevronChevronCasetifyMagSafe Wallet$38 CasetifyYou can always rely on Casetify for fun designs. Its Snappy MagSafe wallets are available in various styles and colors. It's slim, durable, and sleek—the illustrations haven't faded after months of use. It's vegan leather (aka plastic), but Casetify uses BioVeg, derived from recycled polyester and vegetable oil from non-food and GMO-free corn crops.It can hold up to three cards, and there's a built-in shield that protects them from magnetic damage. My only gripe is that it can be a little difficult to pull the cards out when the wallet is attached to your phone or case. I typically have to detach it and use the opening from the back to slide the cards out.Material: Recycled polyester and vegetable oilCards: Fits 3 cards comfortablyAnother Good Kickstand/Wallet ComboPhotograph: Brenda StolyarCourtesy of MoftChevronChevronMoftSnap-on Phone Stand & Wallet$30 Amazon$30 MoftMoft's Snap-on Phone Stand and Wallet is another good kickstand wallet if the UAG we recommend above isn't to your taste. You can set it up at three angles: one for scrolling through your phone, one for streaming media, and one for video conferencing. It feels sturdy, and the case isn't bulky. I wouldn't put more than two cards in this one, because it's too tight a fit with three. I usually use it to carry my license and debit card, while the rest are in my Apple Wallet.Material: Vegan leatherCards: Fits 2 cards comfortablyA Hard-Shell WalletPhotograph: Brenda StolyarCourtesy of AmazonChevronChevronCaselyMagWallet$25 Amazon$25 CaselyCasely's wallet is made of hard silicone, so it's slightly heavier and thicker than the other options I've tested. It feels similar to having a MagSafe battery pack on the back. I don't mind the extra weight and thickness because it makes it easier to grip my phone case. There's a dedicated slot at the bottom that makes sliding cards out a breeze. Just know that if you pair it with the complementary Casely case, the whole thing is bulky. But I'm too obsessed with how adorable the matching Coquette Girlie set looks to mind.Material: Soft-touch hard siliconeCards: Fits 3 cards comfortablyFor PopSocket LoyalistsPhotograph: PopSocketsPopSocketsPopwallet+$40 Amazon$40 PopsocketsI'm obsessed with PopSockets—I have one on my phone and my Kindle. If you're also a fan and don't want to get rid of the accessory with a MagSafe wallet, well, you don't have to. The Popwallet+ is both a PopSocket and a wallet. It fits up to three cards (or more, depending on the thickness), and the cloth opening at the bottom makes it easy to push the cards out. The PopSocket works the same way a standard one does, with the ability to expand and collapse the grip. You can swap out the tops if you ever get bored with the design.Material: PolycarbonateCards: Fits 3 cards comfortablyA Wallet Built Like a TankPhotograph: Jacob RoachPhotograph: Jacob RoachCourtesy of SupcaseChevronChevronSupcaseMagFlip$40 Amazon$36 Walmart$45 Best BuySupcase’s MagFlip wallet and stand is a tank, and I’m not sure it’ll ever break. It’s constructed almost entirely out of metal, fitted with huge magnets that never let go and thick hinges around the body. You can store up to five cards in the wallet itself, and there's an RFID-blocking card that sits at the end, though this kind of protection is largely unnecessary.It doubles as a two-height stand, as well. You can kick the wallet back and prop your phone up, but if you rotate the wallet around, you can position your phone even higher with a kickstand that keeps everything stable. Even with the rugged, almost militarized construction, SupCase still offers a handful of attractive colors, including one that combines a faux leather exterior with regal gold accents.Material: Aluminum and siliconeCards: Fits 5 cards comfortably, plus RFID-blocking cardA MagSafe Wallet … With MagSafePhotograph: Jacob RoachCourtesy of SpigenChevronChevronSpigenValentinus$50 $32 (36% off) Amazon$50 SpigenLooks like you need some MagSafe for your MagSafe. Look no further than the Valentinus wallet from Spigen. It’s constructed out of polyurethane leather and can technically hold three cards (I'm able to easily fit four). It comes with a handy card cutout at the bottom so you can quickly thumb through them. The real draw is an extra MagSafe ring built into the back of the wallet.Stack a MagSafe grip on the back, mount your phone to a MagSafe car stand, or attach whatever other MagSafe accessory you want; you don’t need to take off your wallet first. You can’t charge your phone through the wallet, but even the convenience of using other accessories while keeping your wallet attached is worth the price of admission.Material: Polyurethane leatherCards: Fits 4 cards comfortablyOther Good MagSafe WalletsESR Magnetic Wallet HaloLock With Find My
Courtesy of ESRESR Magnetic Wallet HaloLock With Find My for $40: Like Apple's MagSafe wallet, this one has Find My support. You can use the flap on the back as a grip and fit two cards easily. It does require recharging with a proprietary cable, which is annoying, though it didn't lose much battery life after six months. Too bad I've already lost the cable.OtterBox Symmetry Series Cactus Leather MagSafe Wallet for $45: It's nice and simple, thin, lightweight, has a strong hold on my phone case, and offers a dedicated fabric-covered slot at the bottom to push the cards out (I was able to fit three without much trouble). This OtterBox wallet is made from cactus-based leather, which feels nearly as luxurious as real leather. Just know that cactus leather isn't as eco-friendly as it's made out to be—these cases are still infused with layers of plastics.Apple FineWoven MagSafe Case for $50: Any time the wallet is separated from your iPhone, you'll get an alert and can track it in Apple's Find My app. It has a single slot that can fit up to three cards, but to take the cards out, you have to remove it from your iPhone and push the cards up via the slot on the back. Unfortunately, Apple's MagSafe wallets exclusively use the company's proprietary FineWoven material (made of recycled materials). It's a commendable effort to reduce reliance on leather production, but several WIRED reviewers have said the material doesn't hold up all that well after some time.Bluebonnet Minimalist Full-Grain Leather MagSafe Wallet Card Holder for $68: Bluebonnet's wallet is thin, even with cards inside, and also comes with an elastic grip you can put your fingers through to hold the phone more securely. The magnets are stronger than those in other wallets I've tested, though the bottom moves a bit when using the grip. Bluebonnet claims it can fit up to three cards, but I've been able to fit only two (my license and debit card). It's a struggle to insert or remove more than that.Avoid This WalletOhsnap! Snap Grip Wallet for $100: I had high hopes for this one, mainly because of its build quality. The wallet is aluminum, can hold up to eight cards (depending on whether they're lettered or not), has MagSafe support, and comes with a grip that doubles as a kickstand. Unfortunately, the grip is made of plastic, and it broke after a short time (it won't fold properly back into place). The magnetic hold isn't as strong as other MagSafe wallets, even with a MagSafe-approved case on my phone. None of that is great, especially at this high price.Benks 600D MagSafe Wallet with Stand for $33: The Benks 600D MagSafe wallet might be made with Kelvar, but it sure doesn’t feel like it. The inside shell of the wallet is made with plastic, and after just a day of use, I spotted a crack in that plastic right next to the hinge. Worse, I tried to apply a bit of pressure to see if the hinge would still hold up, which completely warped the MagSafe ring. Even without clear durability problems, this wallet wouldn’t make the top of the list. It’s reasonably priced at $30 and comes in a handful of attractive colors, but it’s limited to just three cards, and there’s no easy way to get them out.Power up with unlimited access to WIRED.
