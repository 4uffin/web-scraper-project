Apple’s MagSafe is an accessory system integrated into the iPhone 12, iPhone 13, iPhone 14, iPhone 15, iPhone 16, and iPhone 17 range (excluding the iPhone 16e). A ring of magnets on the back of the phone (and in MagSafe-enabled cases) allows you to attach MagSafe chargers that can recharge your iPhone wirelessly.MagSafe is now interchangeably used with Qi2. While iPhones are compatible with Qi2, so are some Android phones, such as the Google Pixel 10 series (you can also pair an Android phone with a MagSafe case). Snag a Qi2 or MagSafe wireless charger for your nightstand, work desk, and car, and you can easily top up throughout the day. These are the best Qi2 and MagSafe chargers we've tested (we'll list the compatibility for each recommendation).Check out our related iPhone guides, such as the Best iPhones, Best iPhone 17 Cases, Best iPhone 16 Cases, Best iPhone 15 Cases, Best MagSafe Accessories, Best MagSafe Power Banks, Best MagSafe Wallets, and Best Wireless Chargers.Updated September 2025: We've added chargers from Belkin, Google, Satechi, and an honorable mention for a Mous charger.What Is MagSafe and Qi2?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronMagSafe is the name of Apple’s accessory system integrated into the iPhone 12, iPhone 13, iPhone 14, iPhone 15, and iPhone 16, and iPhone 17 range, excluding the iPhone 16e. A ring of magnets on the back of the phone (and in MagSafe cases) can help transfer power more precisely and faster than traditional wireless chargers. However, it's also a handy way to hold an accessory in place, like a wallet, or to mount the iPhone without requiring clamps. There's an enormous range of MagSafe-compatible accessories now.Qi2 is the next generation wireless charging standard, and Apple worked with the Wireless Power Consortium to develop it. Compared to the original Qi standard, it brings MagSafe-style magnetic charging, faster charging rates, and improved efficiency—but where MagSafe is an Apple technology designed for Apple products, any device can support Qi2. Apple updated the iPhone 12 and newer to support Qi2, so Qi2 should be a term you look for when shopping for a magnetic wireless charger. Qi2 Android phones are still thin on the ground right now, though Qi2 Ready phones add magnets using a compatible case. Expect more Qi2 Android phones in 2026. A Qi2 charger can charge your iPhone and any other Qi2 phones.What Is StandBy mode?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronStandBy mode was introduced in iOS 17 and enables you to use your phone as a bedside alarm clock. When you place your iPhone on a charger in landscape orientation, it will turn the screen into a dock of sorts, showing the clock (with different designs you can choose from), photos from your library, or widgets. If you have an iPhone that supports an always-on screen, you can choose to have the display automatically turn off after some time when the iPhone isn't in use or if the room is dark. Head to Settings > Standby to customize it.Android phones owners can set a screensave to pop up when their phone is placed on a Qi2 charging stand. You can set a digital or analog clock, a slideshow from Google Photos, or Google Home controls for fast access to your smart home devices. Head to Settings > Display & touch > Screensaver to configure it.How We TestAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronI test every MagSafe charger for at least a week, using it to charge my iPhone 16 and my wife's iPhone 12. I also test Qi2 chargers with my Pixel 10 Pro XL. I live with most chargers on my nightstand or work desk. Where possible, I check the charging rate and note the time it takes to charge my iPhone. I assess the usability of the design, the strength of the magnets, test any additional charging pads or ports, and try out any special features.Best MagSafe ChargerPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuAppleMagSafe Charger (2 m)$49 $35 (29% off) Amazon$50 $35 (30% off) Best Buy$49 AppleYou can't go wrong with the official Apple MagSafe charger, especially since the company revamped it to include a 2-meter integrated cable (around 6.5 feet). This Qi2-certified charger can charge up to 25 watts for iPhone 16 models, but you need to pair it with a 30-watt USB-C power adapter of your choosing. We like the Anker Nano. This can also recharge other devices like AirPods with the wireless charging case.SpecsCompatibilityQi2, MagSafeWattageUp to 25 wattsIn the Box6.5-foot cable (attached)Warranty1 yearBest MagSafe StandPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuNomadStand (MagSafe)$119 NomadStriking the perfect balance between heft and magnetism is tricky, but Nomad nails it with the Stand. It's heavy enough that you won’t knock it over when you fumble for your iPhone, and you can peel it away from the charger one-handed. The stand comes in black or white and feels sturdy, featuring an aluminum and glass body with rubber padding. Nomad initially had a Qi2 model, but it's now sold out, and only the official MagSafe model is available. The charging speed for MagSafe iPhones is fast, with the maximum 15-watt rate supported.It can get a little warm when charging, but not unusually so. You get a high-quality braided cable in the box, but you will need a 20-watt wall charger. We like Nomad’s 20-watt charger ($19), but I can’t help feeling it should have been included at this price.SpecsCompatibilityMagSafeWattageUp to 15 wattsIn the Box6.6-foot cable (attached)Warranty2 yearsBest 3-in-1 MagSafe ChargerPhotograph: Simon HillBelkin3-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand$130 $110 (15% off) Amazon$110 Best Buy$130 Apple$110 BelkinFolks with the holy trinity of Apple products will love Belkin’s 3-in-1 charging tree. It has a similar design to the 2-in-1 below, but the metal post is T-shaped, with a pad for your iPhone on one side and an Apple Watch spot on the other, plus a Qi-certified base for AirPods. The main charging stand is fully Qi2 certified to deliver 15 watts, and the puck can fast-charge capable Apple Watches. You can also pop your iPhone in landscape orientation if you want StandBy mode—it doesn't interfere with the Apple Watch. Belkin includes a power adapter with an attached cable.Read our Best 3-in-1 Apple Chargers guide for more picks.SpecsCompatibilityQi2, MagSafeWattageUp to 15 wattsIn the Box5-foot cable (attached) and 36-watt power adapterWarranty2 yearsBest 2-in-1 MagSafe ChargerCourtesy of BelkinBelkinBoostCharge Pro 2-in-1$100 $80 (20% off) AmazonMy favorite 2-in-1 MagSafe wireless charger is perfect for charging your iPhone and AirPods (or any other wireless earbuds with wireless charging support). It has a wide, circular base with a shiny metallic post connecting the MagSafe charging pad. Ours is white, but there’s a black option too. Stick your iPhone in landscape view, and you can enjoy StandBy mode, turning your iPhone into an alarm clock. This charger can provide the top 15-watt rate and includes a power adapter with a 5-foot cable permanently attached.SpecsCompatibilityMagSafeWattageUp to 15 wattsIn the Box5-foot cable (attached)Warranty2 yearsBest for TravelPhotograph: Simon HillAnkerMagGo 3-in-1 Charging Station (Qi2)$110 $77 (30% off) Amazon$100 Walmart$110 AnkerSpace is at a premium when you travel, but Anker’s MagGo 3-in-1 folds away to an impressively compact form. It doesn’t scrimp on power, charging your iPhone or Qi2-certified phone at up to 15 watts on a magnetic pad that can adjust to your preferred angle. A second pad behind the main pad charges AirPods or other wireless earbuds, and there is a fold-out Apple Watch charger. You get a USB-C cable (around 5 feet) and a wall adapter in the box.SpecsCompatibilityQi2, MagSafeWattageUp to 15 wattsIn the Box5-foot cable and 40-watt power adapterWarranty2 yearsGoogle's Official Qi2 ChargerPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuChevronChevronGooglePixelsnap Charger With Stand$40 Amazon (Charger)$70 Amazon (Stand)$40 Google Store (Charger)Google's latest smartphones, the Pixel 10 series, all support Qi2 magnetic charging. If you have one of those devices, it's natural to want a charger from the same manufacturer. The Pixelsnap Charger With Stand is technically two components. There's the stand, and then there's the Pixelsnap charger, which is designed very much like Apple's MagSafe Charger above. You can take the charger out of the stand fairly easily, say, if you want to hold and use your phone as it charges. Or you can buy the charger as a standalone if you don't want to pay the premium. It is expensive with the stand, and it really should come with a charging adapter. Thankfully, the stand—made from a mix of aluminum and polycarbonate—is very sturdy and doesn't slide around. I haven't had any issues with heat as well.This is technically a Qi2 25W charger, which is the latest spec of the Qi2 standard, allowing you to recharge Qi2 25W phones at a higher 25-watt speed. The latest iPhones and Google's Pixel 10 Pro XL support Qi2 25W, so if you have one of those, you'll need to pair this with a 35W charging adapter. Otherwise, you can make do with a 20W charger. —Julian ChokkattuSpecsCompatibilityQi2WattageUp to 25 wattsIn the Box3.3-foot USB-C cableWarranty1 yearBest 2-in-1 Travel Charger for Apple WatchPhotograph: Simon HillPhotograph: Simon HillChevronChevronSatechiOntheGo 2-in-1 Wireless Charger$80 Amazon$80 SatechiWhile there are a few circular folding chargers now, Satechi’s is the one I currently throw in my bag for trips. It has a textured fake leather finish, supports Qi2 for up to 15-watt phone charging, and has a fold-up Apple Watch charger for Nightstand mode. It snaps together satisfyingly with magnets and comes with a USB-C cable and a wee canvas bag, though you don’t really need the bag. The only downside is that the Apple Watch charger tops out at 5 watts. You can add a third pad for AirPods for an extra $20.SpecsCompatibilityQi2, MagSafeWattageUp to 15 wattsIn the Box3.3-foot USB-C cableWarranty2 yearsBest 2-in-1 Travel Charger for EarbudsPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuBelkinUltraCharge 2-in-1 Foldable Magnetic Wireless Charger (Qi2 25W)$60 Amazon$60 BelkinBelkin has a new line of more versatile travel-friendly foldable Qi2 25W chargers, allowing you to keep them on a desk or nightstand when you're at home, or pop ‘em in the bag to take on a trip. My favorite is the UltraCharge 2-in-1 Foldable Magnetic Charger, which supports any Qi2 (and Qi2 25W) phone for the fastest speeds in landscape or portrait orientation. When it’s unfolded, there's a spot on the back to recharge wireless earbuds at up to 5W. Better yet, if you brought along your watch's charger, you can plug it into the 5W USB-C port on the side, turning this 2-in-1 into a 3-in-1. (There's also an official 3-in-1 version of this charger that has an Apple Watch charger that folds out from the back of the stand.)You can adjust the viewing angle of the charging stand, but the best part is that Belkin includes a compact 45-W charging adapter and a USB-C cable, so you get everything you need for not a lot of cash. —Julian ChokkattuSpecsCompatibilityQi2WattageUp to 25 wattsIn the Box5-foot USB-C cableWarranty2 yearsBest MagSafe Car MountPhotograph: Simon HillBelkinBoostCharge Pro Car Charger$70 Walmart$80 BelkinThis simple MagSafe mount slots into any vent in your car and has a powerful magnet array that keeps your iPhone securely in place, even on bumpy roads. There’s a ball joint so you can angle your iPhone slightly for a better view, and it’s easy to place it on the mount and remove it one-handed. You get a 12-volt car adapter and a USB-C cable in the box. Vent mounts are unobtrusive and may help your phone keep cool.If you prefer something different, read our Best Car Phone Mounts and Chargers guide for more options.SpecsCompatibilityQi2, MagSafeWattageUp to 15 wattsIn the Box3.9-foot cable and 12-volt car adapterWarranty2 yearsBest MagSafe Power BankPhotograph: Simon HillAnkerMagGo Power Bank (10K) (Qi2)$90 $70 (22% off) Amazon$90 $72 (20% off) Walmart$90 AnkerThere are many great MagSafe power banks now, but this Anker model is my favorite. It has an ample 10,000-mAh capacity, enough for almost two full charges for most iPhones, supports Qi2 for speedy charging, and has an LED display that shows the precise percentage of remaining power. It even has a built-in kickstand for propping your iPhone in portrait or landscape orientation (handy for StandBy mode when traveling). You can also charge with the 2-foot USB-C cable supplied via the USB-C port at up to 27 watts.SpecsCompatibilityQi2, MagSafeWattageUp to 15 watts (27 watts wired)In the Box2-foot cableWarranty2 yearsBest Cheap MagSafe Power BankPhotograph: Simon HillAnker622 MagGo Portable Charger (A1614)$48 $34 (29% off) Amazon$48 AnkerSling a MagSafe power bank in your bag, and you can attach it when you need to top up your iPhone battery. This MagSafe battery pack boosted my iPhone 14 Pro’s battery by 78 percent and took around three hours to charge. (Since wireless charging is not the most efficient method, you will never get the stated capacity of a MagSafe power bank.) You can continue using your iPhone while charging because it doesn’t add much bulk, and there’s a small fold-out kickstand for propping your iPhone in portrait or landscape orientation. Just ensure you get the newer (A1614) version, as it has the USB-C port on the side and can turn off if you want to use it as a stand.

This classy and roomy tray from Courant has a MagSafe spot for your iPhone, a secondary charging spot for your earbuds, and space for all your other daily essentials. I tried the black linen version, but you can opt for lighter shades or a leather finish (though it’s more expensive). The wireless charging is slow, but there is a spare USB-C port. There's also a bright, unnecessary LED on the back of this charger that I had to cover when using this on my nightstand.It looks classy and neat, but the linen version picks up dust easily. WIRED reviews editor Julian Chokkattu has the Leather-Saddle model—he says it doesn't show dust easily and looks great after nearly two years of use.SpecsCompatibilityMagSafeWattageUp to 7.5 watts and 5 wattsIn the Box5-foot cable and power adapterWarranty1 yearBest Family Charging StationPhotograph: Simon HillPhotograph: Simon HillChevronChevronZensQuattro Charger Pro 4$150 Apple$144 ZensThis family charging station boasts four MagSafe charging spots across two tiers. Each can charge your iPhone at up to 15 watts. It comes in black or white, the solid construction feels durable, and it stays in place securely. It works with MagSafe iPhones but is also Qi2-certified and can charge any Qi-supporting phone or device, including earbud cases. Setting up a charging station like this in the kitchen or hallway is a great way to keep those phones out of the bedroom at night. Included is a thick barrel port cable and a chunky 65-watt power supply.SpecsCompatibilityQi2, MagSafeWattageUp to 15 wattsIn the Box5-foot cable and attached 65-watt power adapterWarranty3 yearsA Rotating StandPhotograph: Simon HillAnkerMagGo Wireless Charging Stand$40 $29 (28% off) AmazonIt looks simple, but this Qi2-certified charging stand has a neat trick we haven’t seen before: The pad can rotate through 360 degrees. Want to switch from portrait to landscape orientation? You can simply spin your iPhone. It moves easily with a satisfying sound that makes me think of a safe dial. The pad holds your iPhone securely and sits on a ball joint, so you can tip it back to lay an AirPods charging case flat on top.SpecsCompatibilityQi2, MagSafeWattageUp to 15 wattsIn the Box5-foot cableWarranty2 yearsA Face-Tracking StandPhotograph: Brenda StolyarBelkinAuto-Tracking Stand Pro with DockKit$150 Amazon$150 Best BuyNot everyone needs a face-tracking stand for their iPhone, but Belkin’s Auto-Tracking Stand Pro is terrific for content creators. Pair your iPhone (it's only made for iPhones, since it relies on Apple’s DockKit technology), pop it on the MagSafe pad, and open the camera app to have the dock track your face, keeping you in the frame as you move around. It tracks effectively and quietly, turning through 360 degrees and tilting up or down through 90 degrees. You can outrun it if you try, but at a regular walking pace, it keeps up. It works with FaceTime and several third-party apps, including TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, and WhatsApp. The battery inside can go for up to five hours, and there’s a standard 1/4-inch thread on the bottom for attaching a tripod.SpecsCompatibilityMagSafeWattageUp to 15 wattsIn the Box5-foot cable (attached) and 30-watt power adapterWarranty2 yearsA Retractable CablePhotograph: Simon HillBaseusPicoGo W2 Wireless Charger$40 $19 (53% off) AmazonThe hinged Qi2/MagSafe charging pad can lie flat or be tilted to support StandBy mode for iPhones. The charger also has a retractable USB-C cable on the right (about 2 feet long) to charge another device, like a laptop, tablet, or earbuds. It is lightweight, so the sticky pad provided is essential to secure it on your desk or nightstand. You also get a USB-C cable with a right-angled connector in the box to plug into the power input on the left-hand side, but you need a power adapter rated at 100 watts to get the maximum charging rates.SpecsCompatibilityQi2, MagSafeWattageUp to 15 watts, up to 67 watts (wired)In the Box1.9-foot cable (attached)Warranty18 monthsCutest MagSafe ChargerPhotograph: Simon HillUgreenUno 2-in-1 Magnetic Wireless Charger$60 $44 (27% off) AmazonPutting a wee robotic face on a charger may sound silly, but this pixelated visage is so cute. It even changes expression when something is charging. A hinged Qi2-certified charging pad works with iPhones in portrait or landscape orientation (handy for Standby Mode), but it can also lie flat to charge any Qi device. Tilt the pad up through 70 degrees, and you’ll find a second pad for AirPods or other wireless earbud cases to charge on. It even has a spare USB-C port for slow charging another phone or a smartwatch. You get a 3.3-foot USB-C cable to plug into the back, but you’ll need a 30-watt power adapter (we like the Anker Nano).SpecsCompatibilityQi2, MagSafeWattageUp to 15 watts, up to 5 watts (wired)In the Box3.3-foot USB-C cableWarranty2 yearsMore Good MagSafe and Qi2 ChargersHere are a few other MagSafe wireless chargers we have tested that didn't quite manage to earn a place above.Photograph: Simon HillMous Dual Charging Station for $100: This dual charger from Mous is a looker (I tested the walnut), but disappoints on charging speeds, maxing out at 15 watts for the main MagSafe pad and just 5 watts for the second Qi pad, though there is a spare USB-C port that can charge at 18 watts. You can also add an Apple Watch charger ($55) that connects magnetically to the pogo pins at one end (5-watt maximum) and pops up for Nightstand mode.Anker MagGo Wireless Charger Pad (Qi2) for $19: Our top pick until Apple’s redesign, this Qi2 charger brings MagSafe-style magnetic charging and a 15-watt charging rate. This pad stays put, has a durable aluminum casing that stays relatively cool, and has a 5-foot USB-C cable permanently attached. It can also charge AirPods with a magnetic charging case, but it does not come with a power adapter.Photograph: Simon HillUAG Wireless Charging Pad and Stand for $60: If you like industrial design with a carbon-fiber finish, this magnetic charging puck from Urban Armor Gear is solid. It has a handy kickstand for propping your iPhone in landscape orientation to watch a video, and it comes with a detachable, rugged 4-foot USB-C cable but no power adapter. UAG says it can deliver up to 15 watts but is not Qi2-certified. It's just way too expensive.Belkin BoostCharge Pro Convertible Magnetic Wireless Charging Stand for $60: This Qi2-certified stand has a magnetic pad that can lie flat to charge older phones or fold out to act as a stand for MagSafe iPhones and other Qi2 phones in portrait or landscape orientation (handy for StandBy mode). It charges at up to 15 watts and comes with a 5-foot USB-C to USB-C cable and a power supply.Casetify PowerThru 2-in-1 Charging Stand for $78: If you want a charger for your MagSafe iPhone and AirPods (or other earbuds), this one from Casetify is a decent pick. It has a squared-off base with an indent for AirPods, a metallic rod, and a slightly adjustable MagSafe pad for your iPhone that charges at 7.5 watts. I don’t love the visible logo around the pad or the options with basketball courts and other designs for the base, and it has a bright LED.Casetify Magnetic Wireless Charger for $38: Cute design galore elevates Casetify’s MagSafe charger lineup. It offers more than 600 designs, from cat art to sports teams. It is a Qi charger with MagSafe, so it will align perfectly with MagSafe iPhones and charge at 7.5 watts, but it also supports Qi charging and can juice up any Qi phone at up to 15 watts. It comes with a 3.3-foot, permanently attached, black and white braided USB-C cable, but you need a power adapter.Mophie's 3-in-1 Travel Charger With MagSafe for $75: This is a nice travel option, though it takes up a bit more space when it's unfolded. It folds neatly into a fabric case with a cable and charging adapter. It will fast-charge iPhones at 15 watts, and this updated model includes fast-charging support for the Apple Watch and has a spot for your AirPods Pro.Power up with unlimited access to WIRED.
