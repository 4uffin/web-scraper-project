Dogs. And some of the best dog beds, funny enough, often come from human-mattress brands that you may recognize. Now, if we were to consult the dogs themselves, I'm sure that they would be more than happy to tag along with you in your bed, on the couch, or any bed provided to them.As a professional mattress tester and certified sleep science coach, however, I can tell you that you may not be getting your best sleep when you let your dog sleep on your bed with you. But do as I say, not as I do, because I'm also guilty of not following this advice with my own dogs. However, having a dog bed available to them in my bedroom (and in every room of the house) has turned out well, because they can jump ship (aka, my bed) whenever they please.There is no “one size fits all” bed for humans, much less for dogs. The WIRED Reviews team got their pups to pitch in and test which ones their dogs returned to again and again. Here is their feedback, in so many words. Or, rather, naps.Updated September 2025: We've added recently tested dog beds from Saatva, Avocado, Naturepedic, and Bedsure. You will also find links to new related content throughout, like the best mattresses (for humans) we've tested, tips on mattress shopping, and deep dives on sleep health.Table of ContentsAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronHow Do I Pick a Dog Bed?How Firm Does My Dog's Bed Need to Be?How Does WIRED Acquire Dog Beds to Test?What Does WIRED Do With the Dog Beds After Testing Them?Our Favorite Dog BedPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuCasperDog Bed$139 $125 (10% off) Amazon$139 CasperWhen my husband suggested a Casper mattress for our dog four years ago, I had serious reservations. Memory foam for a dog? It seemed extra at the time, but I was quick to change my mind once I saw my dog lounging in it immediately. The memory foam is sturdy, the cover is removable and washable, and the design is subtle enough to match most home decor. My pup Winston loved it for two years, but my other dog Parmesan peed on it more than we could keep up with in her puppy days.The Casper Dog Bed comes in three sizes (small, medium, and large), in a few colors, and is up to about 7 inches thick at its thickest section. It's pricey, but in our research, licensed veterinarians recommend using memory foam beds to protect joints and muscles and warned that beds too high could be problematic for a dog that's arthritic or has other physical struggles. It's a great safe option if you're unsure of what to get. —Haley SprankleAvailable sizesSmall (26" x 19" x 6"), medium (33" x 25" x 6"), large (45" x 35" x 7")ColorsGray, blue, sandAssembly required?YesCertificationsCertiPur-US certified foamShippingFreeTrialFreeWarranty1 year limitedWIRED/TIREDAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWIREDCover is removable and machine washableBolster design lets dogs lean up against the perimeter of the bed to feel secureThe toy that comes with it (a waffle!) is very durable as wellTIREDDoesn't come fully set up, and you will have to zip the interior pillows into the coverThe Best Fuzzy Doughnut BedPhotograph: Julia ForbesBedsureDog Bed (Medium)$33 $23 (30% off) Amazon$29 BedsureDogs, notably smaller breeds, seem to love beds that are overtly soft and squishy. I'm a big fan of Bedsure's cooling sheets, not only for the value, but for the quality feel they provide. My dogs feel the same way about Bedsure's dog bed. Chances are, if they disappear in the house, they're camping out in this bed. Its softer foam, faux sherpa cover, and surrounding bolster provided by the “doughnut” design help give a snuggly sense of security to pups. What gives me a sense of security is not only the Oeko-Tex Standard 100 certification (ensuring no harmful chemicals for my pups), but also the fact that the bed is machine washable. So whatever my dogs throw at it, do in it, or eat in it, it's easy to clean.One thing to watch out for is that, over time, the fabric on the cover will start to shed. It doesn't create any patchiness across the bed, but my puppy thinks it's fun to snack on. I do not. Make sure to follow the washing instructions closely!Available sizesXS (20" x 20" x 6"), small (23" x 23" x 8"), small plus (27" x 27" x 8"), medium (30" x 30" x 8"), medium plus (33" x 33" x 8"), large (36" x 36" x 10"), XL (45" x 45" x 10")ColorsApple green, aqua blue, black, camel, coffee, copper, dark grey, frost grey, green, ivory beige, light blue, mauve blush, multi color, navy, pale grey, pink, washed blue, cream, purpleAssembly required?NoCertificationsOeko-Tex Standard 100ShippingFree with Amazon Prime membershipTrialFree returns with Amazon Prime membershipWarrantyN/AWIRED/TIREDAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWIREDCircular design and fuzzy texture create a soft, soothing environment for your dogs to snoozeMachine washableTIREDSheds like crazy, and I'm not talking about your dogBest for Dogs Who BurrowPhotograph: AmazonFurHavenFaux Sheepskin Snuggery Dog Bed$39 AmazonYou know how nice it is to burrow under a blanket after a long day? Some dogs like doing exactly that, which might be an ancestral trait from living in the security of a den, according to the American Kennel Club. The Furhaven Snuggery is great for this. My pups tried the memory foam version (there are cooling gel foam and orthopedic foam models as well), and it's both supportive and covered in faux sheepskin. The top is convertible, with a removable tube that allows the cover to act as a blanket or sit upright and sturdy as an easier entryway.Furhaven has several sizes, and the product page has recommendations on what model to buy depending on your dog's weight and breed. —Haley SprankleAvailable sizesSmall (26" x 26" x 3"), medium (35" x 35" x 3") x large (44" x 44" x 3")ColorsSuede blue & faux lambswool, suede cream & faux lambswool, suede espresso & faux lambswool, suede gray & faux lambswool, suede pink & faux lambswool, microvelvet navyAssembly required?NoCertificationsCertiPur-US certified foamShippingFree with Amazon Prime membershipTrialFree returns with Amazon Prime membershipWarranty90-day limited manufacturer warranty plus 60 days (registration required upon delivery, and must have purchased from verified vendor)WIRED/TIREDAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWIREDRemovable cover can be thrown in the washing machine whenever you need.CertiPur-US certified memory foam helps with pressure relief.Hood is removable if your dog doesn't want to burrow into the bed.TIREDMust buy from verified vendor and register upon arrival to get tandem 60- and 90-day warranty coverage.Most Durable Dog BedPhotograph: Julia ForbesPhotograph: Julia ForbesChevronChevronNaturepedicOrganic Pet Bed With Waterproof Cover$129 Naturepedic$129 AmazonLike a moth to the flame, many dogs love sunbathing. “Let's go bake beans!”—referring to both toe beans and my dogs—is a regular call to action in my household as we go sit outdoors. While my dogs adore their Coolaroo (listed below!), keeping them outside when it's hot can be dangerous. The compromise is setting them up next to a sunny window with a bed that regulates temperature well.Both dogs regularly use Naturepedic's organic dog bed, which has an organic cotton cover that is both washable and waterproof. The insert has shredded latex. As a mattress material, it does well with dispelling heat, relieving pressure, and having a bouncy feel. In shredded form, it's even squishier—which my dogs love to snuggle into. It also has all the certifications you'd see with the people bed equivalent: UL GreenGuard Gold certified, UL certified formaldehyde-free, GOLS certified latex, and Made Safe verification to ensure there are no harmful chemicals.The waterproof cover isn't the softest, but it makes it durable enough to pop on the patio from time to time (don't leave it outside, though). We throw on one of the dogs' blankets, and they're happy to lounge.Available sizesSmall (23" x 17" x 3"), medium (29" x 18" x 3"), large (35" x 22" x 4"), XL (41" x 27" x 4"), XXL (47" x 29" x 5")ColorsGrayAssembly required?YesCertificationsUL GreenGuard Gold certified, UL certified formaldehyde-free, GOLS certified latex, and MadeSafe verificationShippingFree in contiguous USTrial30 nightsWarranty1 yearWIRED/TIREDAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWIREDFive sizes available, ranging from small to XXLShredded latex interior provides pups with softness and pressure relief without them feeling smotheredCover isn't just waterproof, but washable as wellCrate-friendly size, height, and shapeTIREDEnvelope enclosure in the center makes removing the insert harderCover isn't very soft, which some pups may not take a liking toBest Firm Dog BedPhotograph: Julia ForbesPhotograph: Julia ForbesChevronChevronAvocadoOrganic Dog Bed$329 $263 (20% off) AvocadoLooking at our cat colleagues, the equivalent of your cat ignoring the lovely cat tree in favor of a cardboard box is just like dogs ignoring their bed for the nice, hard ground. It's highly possible that what they have available to them is too soft for their taste, and a firm bed is a better choice.Avocado's dog bed eliminates all things artificial in favor of GOLS-certified organic latex, a dense organic coconut husk base, and an organic cotton cover. The cover has a slightly rougher texture, but it is designed to be waterproof, anti-odor, antimicrobial, and removable for washing (which it's easy to throw in the washing machine! Thanks for that one, Randy!). It's also PETA-approved, but dogs are carnivores … I don't know if that matters to them. The latex is aerated with holes, which helps an already breathable material stay cooler. You can opt to get a bolster pillow (or not), and Avocado also sells a mini human-like bed frame that the bed pops into for a mini-me moment. The bolster is filled with buckwheat hulls that make some soft swishing noises (like the inside of a beanbag chair). While they are deemed food-safe by Avocado, if you have a mouthy dog like I do with Randy, be careful. They may think it's chew time.According to our testers (i.e., me observing them), the coconut base makes it very firm, which my dogs were not fond of because they are so small. However, their “cousin” Harper, my family's pittie mix who comes over often, loved it. She's three times their size and recovering from ACL surgery, yet prefers the solid ground over her bed. Now, spends her afternoons snoozing on it.Available sizesSmall/medium (34" x 24" x 4"), large/XL (42" x 32" x 4")ColorsSalmon pink, Field of Green, Squirrel Grey, Mailman BlueAssembly required?YesCertificationsGlobal Organic Latex Standard certified (GOLS), Global Organic Textile Standard certified (GOTS), Forest Stewardship Council certified, Made Safe verificationShippingFreeTrial30 nights (pending it is in good condition)Warranty3 yearsWIRED/TIREDAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWIREDMade of 100 percent organic materialsLight pressure relief, maximum aeration for keeping dogs comfortable and coolTIREDSome dogs may not be keen on the firmer feel if they have joint pain or mobility issuesBest Outdoor Dog BedPhotograph: Julia ForbesCoolaroothe Original Cooling Elevated Pet Bed$36 Amazon$49 $40 (18% off) ChewyDogs love to be outside because it provides them with relaxation, stimulation, and room to roam. I bought my Coolaroo a few years ago to provide my dog Rosi with a more comfortable and cooler space to sunbathe. Dogs can overheat relatively easily, and should do outdoor adventures in shorter time periods to keep them safe. Having a raised bed helps prolong their time outside, as it lets air flow beneath them instead of allowing them to bake on concrete, which my dogs love to do anyway, for whatever reason.This bed is insanely durable and has been an outdoor fixture at my house through sun, rain, sleet, snow, and even hail. Its UV-resistant fabric has managed to maintain its color. I can't say the same for the label, but that's neither here nor there, and your dog sure doesn't care. The alloy steel legs have developed a bit of rust around the hinges, but it's relatively unnoticeable.Available sizesSmall (35" x 22" x 8"), medium (42" x 25.5" x 8"), large (51" x 31.5" x 8"), XL (59.8" x 37" x 8")ColorsAquatic blue, Brunswick green, desert sand, grey, gunmetal, navy blue, nutmeg, terracotta, turquoiseAssembly required?YesCertificationsGreenGuard Gold certifiedShippingFree with Amazon Prime membershipTrialFree returns with Amazon Prime membershipWarranty1 year against UV degredation of fabricWIRED/TIREDAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWIREDHigher platform design helps dogs stay coolVery durable against the elementsTIREDLifted frame and lack of cushioning may be harder for dogs with joint and mobility issuesBest for Glamping DogsPhotograph: Snow PeakSnow PeakDog Cot$160 AmazonPacking up a wet dog bed after camping is more difficult (and gross) than you might imagine—at least, that's what WIRED editor Adrienne So says. She recommends Snow Peak’s dog cot, a cotton canvas bed that sits atop a stainless steel frame. You can easily remove and wash the canvas, getting rid of all your dog’s sweat and stink after your adventure.However, it’s only 24 inches wide, so this is not meant for larger breeds but for pooches that are under 30 pounds. It’s decently raised above the ground, so it’s also not great for tiny pups or dogs with joint issues unless you plan on airlifting them in every time. —Haley SprankleAvailable sizesOne size; 29.63" x 6 x 7"ColorsTanAssembly required?YesCertificationsN/AShippingFree with Amazon Prime membershipTrialFree returns with Amazon Prime membershipWarrantyN/AWIRED/TIREDAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWIREDLightweight for easy campsite packingTIREDNot big enough for larger breedsMost Comfortable Dog BedPhotograph: Julia ForbesPhotograph: Julia ForbesPhotograph: Julia ForbesChevronChevronSaatvaDog Bed$275 SaatvaI've always appreciated Saatva's unique approach to ensuring lumbar support in their mattresses, so it's not shocking to find similar features in the brand's dog beds. Let's just say that if it came in a human size, I'd be down to test.The cover (either a textured bouclé or linen material) is meant to be resistant to liquid and removable when it needs a spin in the washing machine. The upper layer feels almost like a down pillow, and my dogs loved snuggling up together while sinking into it. But to keep them bolstered, the bed has a microcoil support core at the bottom. Truth be told, I didn't detect this right away, other than the sheer weightiness of this bed. But they're there not just for support purposes, but to keep the bed from losing its shape with continued use. It's also meant to help older dogs get in and out with ease, while balancing pressure relief and support for their bodies. To that end, the weave of the cover isn't the most durable, so this isn't the go-to for a teething puppy.It's become a mainstay in my living room, and even though it has a basic rectangular shape, I find the cover to be my favorite of the bunch our family has tested. Again, not that the dogs care either way, because it is soft, squishy, and the ideal nap location.Available sizesSmall (18" x 24" x 4"), medium (25" x 35" x 4"), large (34" x 44" x 4")ColorsTaupe bouclé, slate bouclé, natural linenAssembly required?NoCertificationsN/AShippingFreeTrial45 nightsWarranty1 year limitedWIRED/TIREDAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWIREDFoam and microcoils work together to help with lumbar supportVery cushy for dogs who like to be surrounded by their bedTIREDThe removable cover is pretty, but it isn't meant for dogs who like to chewCompare Our Top PicksBedAvailable SizesColorsAssembly Required?CertificationsShippingTrialWarrantyCasperSmall (26" x 19" x 6"), medium (33" x 25" x 6"), large (45" x 35" x 7")Gray, blue, sandYesCertiPur-US certified foamFreeFree1 year limitedBedsureXS (20" x 20" x 6"), small (23" x 23" x 8"), small plus (27" x 27" x 8"), medium (30" x 30" x 8"), medium plus (33" x 33" x 8"), large (36" x 36" x 10"), XL (45" x 45" x 10")Apple green, aqua blue, black, camel, coffee, copper, dark grey, frost grey, green, ivory beige, light blue, mauve blush, multi color, navy, pale grey, pink, washed blue, cream, purpleNoOeko-Tex Standard 100Free with Amazon Prime membershipFree returns with Amazon Prime membershipN/AFurhavenSmall (26" x 26" x 3"), medium (35" x 35" x 3") x large (44" x 44" x 3")Suede blue & faux lambswool, suede cream & faux lambswool, suede espresso & faux lambswool, suede gray & faux lambswool, suede pink & faux lambswool, microvelvet navyNoCertiPur-US certified foamFree with Amazon Prime membershipFree returns with Amazon Prime membership90-day limited manufacturer warranty plus 60 days (registration required upon delivery, and must have purchased from verified vendor)NaturepedicSmall (23" x 17" x 3"), medium (29" x 18" x 3"), large (35" x 22" x 4"), XL (41" x 27" x 4"), XXL (47" x 29" x 5")GrayYesUL GreenGuard Gold certified, UL certified formaldehyde-free, GOLS certified latex, and MadeSafe verificationFree in contiguous U.S.30 nights1 yearAvocadoSmall/medium (34" x 24" x 4"), large/XL (42" x 32" x 4")Salmon pink, Field of Green, Squirrel Grey, Mailman BlueYesGlobal Organic Latex Standard certified (GOLS), Global Organic Textile Standard certified (GOTS), Forest Stewardship Council certified, Made Safe vertificationFree30 nights (pending it is in good condition)3 yearsCoolarooSmall (35" x 22" x 8"), medium (42" x 25.5" x 8"), large (51" x 31.5" x 8"), XL (59.8" x 37" x 8")Aquatic blue, Brunswick green, desert sand, grey, gunmetal, navy blue, nutmeg, terracotta, turquoiseYesGreenGuard Gold certifiedFree with Amazon Prime membershipFree returns with Amazon Prime membership1 year against UV degradation of fabricSnow PeakOne size; 29.63" x 6 x 7"TanYesN/AFree with Amazon Prime membershipFree returns with Amazon Prime membershipN/ASaatvaSmall (18" x 24" x 4"), medium (25" x 35" x 4"), large (34" x 44" x 4")Taupe bouclé, slate bouclé, natural linenNoN/AFree45 nights1 year limitedFrequently Asked QuestionsHow Do I Pick a Dog Bed?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronEach dog is different, and what my dogs like may not be what's best for your pups. If none of the options above are for you, then here are some tips when shopping for a dog bed, courtesy of licensed vet Jamie Richardson.Taller dogs can tolerate higher beds. It may seem obvious, but the height of the bed is important. Smaller dogs may put too much strain on their joints trying to reach a bed that's too tall, which can lead to issues down the line.Arthritic dogs need a supportive mattress. If your dog has arthritis, get them a memory foam or orthopedic bed for support. You'll also want to make sure the bed is low to the ground to reduce the effort they need to get on it.Consider your pet's preferences (and your own). If your dog is a burrower, then a snuggle bed with a cover might be a great option for them. My dogs get hot really easily, so they can only use blankets and covered beds in moderation. Your needs are important too. If the task of spot-cleaning their messes is too much for your schedule, opt for a bed with a removable cover so you can just toss it in the wash. If you travel a lot with your dog, maybe get a bed with a removable insert that fits into a carrier.How Firm Does My Dog's Bed Need to Be?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronJust like their paw-rents, dogs can tend to have firmness preferences themselves for their beds. They'll let you know if they enjoy their bed by how often they use it—if it's abandoned in the corner of the room, it's safe to say that they don't like it. You can take a educated guess based on where they currently like to sleep the most, whether that be the couch, floor, or their current dog bed. Make sure to take into account their stature (small dogs, small legs; so a higher-up bed isn't the most conducive for their little joints) and if they have any health concerns due to age or medical reasons, like hip dyslpasia or arthritis.How Does WIRED Acquire Dog Beds to Test?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronAll dog beds tested for this guide were either samples provided by the manufacturer with no obligation for coverage or promises for what coverage could look like, or purchased ourselves on our own accord.What Does WIRED Do With the Dog Beds After Testing Them?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWhile your dog may love having a bed in every room, sometimes there is too much of a good thing happening.
