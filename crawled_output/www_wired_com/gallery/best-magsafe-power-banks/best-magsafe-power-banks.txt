Smartphone stamina has improved over the years, but so have cameras, games, and everything else, causing us to spend more time than ever tapping those screens and running the battery down. Faster charging helps, and wireless chargers and 3-in-1 charging systems make it easier to stay topped up, but running out of juice before the day’s end is still a real problem.Portable chargers come in all shapes and sizes; for iPhone owners, it makes sense to snag a power bank that supports Apple’s MagSafe or Qi2 technology. Forget fumbling with a charging cable or trying to juggle two devices. You can stick a magnetic power bank to the back of your iPhone or Qi2 Android phone, charge it wirelessly, and then detach and stuff it in a bag when empty. After months of testing, these are the best MagSafe power banks for you.Read our other charging and MagSafe guides, including the Best Portable Chargers, Best MagSafe Wallets, Best MagSafe Wireless Chargers, and Best MagSafe Accessories.Updated September 2025: We've added a power bank from Pitaka, honorable mentions for Anker, Mous, and Apple chargers, and a section on Qi2.What Is MagSafe and Qi2?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronMagSafe is the name of Apple’s accessory system integrated into the iPhone 12, iPhone 13, iPhone 14, iPhone 15, and iPhone 16, and iPhone 17 range (excluding the iPhone 16e). A ring of magnets on the back of the phone (and in MagSafe cases) can help transfer power more precisely and faster than traditional wireless chargers. However, it's also a handy way to hold an accessory in place, like a wallet, or to mount the iPhone without requiring clamps. There's an enormous range of MagSafe-compatible accessories now.Qi2 is the next-generation wireless charging standard, and Apple worked with the Wireless Power Consortium to develop it. Compared to the original Qi standard, it brings MagSafe-style magnetic charging, faster charging rates, and improved efficiency—but where MagSafe is an Apple technology designed for Apple products, any device can support Qi2. Apple updated the iPhone 12 and newer to support Qi2, so Qi2 should be a term you look for when shopping for a magnetic wireless charger. Qi2 Android phones are still thin on the ground right now, though Qi2 Ready phones add magnets using a compatible case. Expect more Qi2 phones in 2026. A Qi2 charger can charge your iPhone and any other Qi2 phones.Frequently Asked Questions About MagSafeAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuDoes MagSafe Reduce Battery Life?There isn’t much evidence that MagSafe charging negatively impacts battery health, but it is less efficient than wired charging and can sometimes generate heat, which may degrade your battery faster. But other factors are more important if you want to preserve battery health (such as never fully draining your battery).What's the Charging Rate?Most MagSafe power banks we have tested wirelessly charge at a rate of up to 7.5 watts, but some newer models, like Anker’s Qi2 power bank, can charge at up to 15 watts.Is USB-C Better Than MagSafe?Wired charging is faster and more efficient than wireless charging, so if you plug your phone in via cable to any of the power banks above, you can expect to get more power more quickly than you will using MagSafe or Qi2. MagSafe is simply more convenient.What Are the Downsides of MagSafe?Older iPhones don't support MagSafe (including the iPhone SE series). It’s not officially compatible with Android phones too. MagSafe is also less efficient than wired charging. Lost energy during wireless charging generates heat, which can have a negative impact on battery health. Unless you have a MagSafe-compatible phone case, you should remove your case to use MagSafe power banks.Why Do MagSafe Power Banks Get Hot?MagSafe is not as efficient as wired charging, and power lost during wireless charging generates heat. MagSafe's magnets reduce this problem, compared to Qi wireless charging, by ensuring the charging coils are aligned. (The Qi2 standard adopts a similar magnetic charging system so that all supported phones can enjoy the more precise charging technology.) Charging phones with cases on can also reduce efficiency and generate more heat.How We TestAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronI always test MagSafe power banks for at least a week, recording how much battery life a fully charged pack adds to my iPhone (previously an iPhone 14 Pro, now an iPhone 16). I also test with my wife's iPhone 12. For Qi2 power banks, I also test with my Google Pixel 10 Pro XL. If there are additional ports or cables, I'll try charging with them too, using a cable with a wattage display. I check how long each fully depleted power bank takes to recharge from an outlet. I also assess the size and weight, the strength of the magnets, the temperature during charging, and any other features such as kickstands or LED displays.Best Overall Qi2 Power BankPhotograph: Simon HillAnkerMagGo Power Bank (10K) (Qi2)$90 $70 (22% off) Amazon$90 $72 (20% off) Walmart$90 AnkerAnker's design boasts a handy kickstand, a two-way USB-C port on the left edge, and a power button with an LED display that shows remaining power and time to charge. You can attach MagSafe iPhones or Qi2 phones in portrait or landscape orientation, and it works with Apple’s StandBy mode. I tested with an iPhone 14 Pro and got 25 percent in around 20 minutes. Despite its large capacity, it falls short of two full charges for your iPhone when charging wirelessly.If you don't care about the display or the kickstand, the Anker Ultra-Slim ($65) is a solid alternative offering the same charging speed and capacity.SpecsPorts:USB-C x 1, Qi2 wireless chargingCapacity:10,000 mAhCharges:Most phones more than onceWattage:15 watts (wireless), 27 watts (wired)Measurements:3.94 x 2.76 x 0.79 inches, 8.8 ouncesWarranty:2 yearsA Personalized Power BankPhotograph: Simon HillInfinacoreM3 Power Bank$50 InfinacoreSeriously svelte and with the option to personalize the back, this 5,000-mAh MagSafe power bank from Infinacore impressed me. The WIRED logo on my review unit looks awesome, and this is one of the smallest power banks I’ve tested, making it ideal if portability is top of your list. It delivers up to 15-watt wireless charging, and the two-way USB-C port is rated at 20 watts. There are LEDs to show the remaining power, the magnets are strong, and it seems to keep cool. The only thing I don’t love is the Infinacore logo on the side. If you don’t care about personalization, you can save $10 by going for a plain one.SpecsPorts:USB-C x 1, Qi2 wireless chargingCapacity:5,200 mAhCharges:Most phones to between 50 and 80 percentWattage:15 watts (wireless), 20 watts (wired)Measurements:3.27 x 2.36 x 0.42 inches, 3.9 ouncesWarranty:Lifetime (requires registration)Best Cheap MagSafe Power BankPhotograph: Simon HillAnker622 MagGo Portable Charger (A1614)$48 $34 (29% off) Amazon$48 AnkerPerhaps my favorite brand for power banks, Anker’s MagGo range includes some of our favorite MagSafe accessories. The 622 is a simple, relatively affordable MagSafe power bank, and it comes in a few fun colors. The foldable stand enables you to prop your iPhone up in portrait or landscape orientation, though it’s not the steadiest. The capacity is a modest 5,000 mAh, which proved capable of adding 78 percent to my iPhone 14 Pro’s battery (since wireless charging is not the most efficient method of charging, you will never get the stated capacity of a MagSafe power bank). This isn't the fastest option, as there's no Qi2 support.Just know that Anker has an older version of this with the USB-C port on the bottom edge of the power bank. The new model (A1614) has it on the side, and you can turn off the power bank so it doesn’t charge the device (when you only want to use the kickstand).SpecsPorts:USB-C x 1, Qi wireless chargingCapacity:5,000 mAhCharges:Most phones to between 50 and 80 percentWattage:7.5 watts (wireless), 12 watts (wired)Measurements:4.13 x 2.61 x 0.5 inches, 5 ouncesWarranty:2 yearsSlimmest Power BankPhotograph: Simon HillPhotograph: Simon HillChevronChevronTorrasMiniMag$60 $36 (40% off) Amazon$40 Best BuyPortable power banks don't come more portable than this. If your top priority is a slim power bank that can cling to the back of your iPhone without adding much bulk, Torras has you covered with the MiniMag. I tested the 5,000-mAh model, and at 0.3 inches and just 112 grams, this is one of the most unobtrusive power banks around. It does have a larger footprint than the Infinacore M3, but because it’s slimmer, it’s easy to use your iPhone with it attached, and the magnets are strong. This power bank can supply up to 7.5 watts wirelessly, and the USB-C port is limited to 18 watts, so it takes a couple of hours to fully charge.SpecsPorts:USB-C x 1, Qi wireless chargingCapacity:5,000 mAhCharges:Most phones to between 50 and 80 percentWattage:7.5 watts (wireless), 18 watts (wired)Measurements:4.01 x 2.5 x 0.3 inches, 4 ouncesWarranty:18 monthsSlim and StylishPhotograph: Simon HillNative Union(Re)Classic Power Bank$70 Amazon$70 Walmart$70 Native UnionSuper svelte, with a lovely textured back made from Yatay (a plant-based fake leather made in Italy), this Native Union power bank is perhaps the best-looking I've tested. I love the green model, and the textured back adds grip. It is also very slim with strong magnets, though it is wider than most MagSafe power banks. It will charge your iPhone wirelessly at 7.5 watts but can dish out up to 15 watts for other Qi phones. Wired charging goes up to 20 watts, and you get a handy 15-centimeter USB-C to USB-C cable in the box. The downside is the relatively high price, so keep a lookout for sales.SpecsPorts:USB-C x 1, Qi wireless chargingCapacity:5,000 mAhCharges:Most phones to between 50 and 80 percentWattage:7.5 watts (wireless), 18 watts (wired)Measurements:4.1 x 2.76 x 0.34 inches, 4.3 ouncesWarranty:2 yearsSpeedy Built-In CablePhotograph: Simon HillEcoflowRapid Qi2 Power Bank$66 AmazonSlim, silver, and speedy, this power bank from EcoFlow is an impressive debut for a company we usually associate with portable power stations. It supports Qi2 for up to 15-watt wireless charging, but there’s also a built-in USB-C cable that can deliver up to 30 watts, and it supports a bunch of charging protocols (PD 3.0, PPS, and QC 3.0). To sweeten the deal further, it has a wee kickstand to prop your iPhone in portrait or landscape orientation for Apple's StandBy feature. The 5,000 mAh model charged my iPhone 14 Pro to 75 percent, and you can fully recharge it via the USB-C port in under an hour.I also tested the larger and bulkier 10,000 mAh model, and it was similarly speedy, but its cable offers up to 65 watts, making it suitable for charging any gadget up to and including a laptop. Too bad it seems to be sold out everywhereSpecsPorts:USB-C x 1, Built-in USB-C cable, Qi2 wireless chargingCapacity:5,000 mAhCharges:Most phones to between 50 and 80 percentWattage:15 watts (wireless), 30 watts (wired)Measurements:4.25 x 2.76 x 0.55 inches, 8.1 ouncesWarranty:2 yearsBest Power Bank and Matching CasePhotograph: Simon HillPhotograph: Simon HillPhotograph: Simon HillChevronChevronPitakaAramid Fiber Magnetic Power Bank$70 Amazon$70 PitakaMost Qi2 power banks have dull designs, so Pitaka’s Aramid Fiber finish caught my eye with its warm coppery tones (it’s called sunset). There’s nothing remarkable about the power bank, but it’s a solid performer, and the textured finish is grippy and pleasant to handle. You can also combine it with a matching, minimal Pitaka case to protect your iPhone. There’s also a black version of the power bank with the same textured fiber finish.SpecsPorts:USB-C x 1, Qi2 wireless chargingCapacity:5,000 mAhCharges:Most phones to between 50 and 80 percentWattage:15 watts (wireless), 20 watts (wired)Measurements:4.1 x 2.8 x 0.35 inches, 4.16 ouncesWarranty:1 yearA MagSafe Power Bank With GripPhotograph: Brenda StolyarPopSocketsMagSafe PowerPack$40 Amazon$40 Best Buy$40 PopsocketsIf you’ve got butterfingers, this MagSafe battery pack could be just what you need because it has a grip built in. The PopSocket makes it easy to hold your phone comfortably and slots away when you don’t need it. The 5,000-mAh capacity is enough to top off your iPhone but likely short of a full charge, and it charges slowly at just 7.5 watts. The LED on the side shows the remaining power, and there’s a USB-C port to recharge it. PopSocket offers a ton of different designs (the one pictured is from its cutesy Bookish collection). It comes with a 1-foot USB-C cable.SpecsPorts:USB-C x 1, Qi wireless chargingCapacity:5,000 mAhCharges:Most phones to between 60 and 90 percentWattage:7.5 watts (wireless), 20 watts (wired)Measurements:4.01 x 2.61 x 0.48 inches, 6.7 ouncesWarranty:3 yearsA Grip, Stand, and Qi2 Power BankPhotograph: Simon HillBaseusPicoGo Qi2 MagSafe Power Bank$50 Amazon$40 Walmart$50 $28 (44% off) BaseusThe clever O-ring design is what makes this power bank stand out. It can rotate 360 degrees and stays securely at the angle you want, so it can be used as a stand to prop your iPhone in portrait or landscape orientation. It can also be used as a grip (though it is thin and not the most comfortable to hold). The magnets are strong, the power bank feels durable, and it almost fully charged my iPhone 14 Pro from 10 percent. This power bank is Qi2 certified, so it can supply 15 watts wirelessly, and you can always plug into the USB-C port for faster charging (up to 20 watts). It is relatively slim and light and has LEDs to show the battery level. It comes with a short USB-C to USB-C cable.SpecsPorts:USB-C x 1, Qi2 wireless chargingCapacity:5,000 mAhCharges:Most phones to between 50 and 80 percentWattage:15 watts (wireless), 20 watts (wired)Measurements:4.07 x 2.63 x 0.54 inches, 6 ouncesWarranty:2 yearsA Cheap High-Capacity ChargerPhotograph: Simon HillBaseusMagnetic Wireless Portable Charger$46 $23 (50% off) Amazon$46 $23 (50% off) BaseusAll the high-capacity MagSafe power banks I tested were chunky and heavy. I’ve picked this Baseus model because it has an ample 10,000-mAh capacity, an inoffensive design, and a reasonable price. It comes in black or white, is gently curved, and is soft to the touch. The bottom edge hosts a USB-C port, a power button, and three LEDs. It fully charged my iPhone 14 Pro once, then delivered an additional 64 percent the second time before tapping out. Baseus offers a version with a built-in USB-C cable and up to 30-watt wired charging, which is handy for folks with the iPhone 15/16 range (or even an Android phone and a MagSafe case).SpecsPorts:USB-C x 1, Qi wireless chargingCapacity:10,000 mAhCharges:Most phones more than onceWattage:7.5 watts (wireless), 20 watts (wired)Measurements:4.3 x 2.8 x 0.73 inches, 7.2 ouncesWarranty:2 yearsA Cool Power BankPhotograph: Simon HillPhotograph: Simon HillChevronChevronShargeIceMag 2$70 $56 (20% off) Amazon$70 $53 (24% off) ShargeWith a transparent section that shows the internals, including a light-up RGB fan that cycles through colors, this MagSafe power bank doesn't just look cool; it keeps your iPhone cool. It is chunky, with a 10,000-mAh capacity, supports Qi2 for rapid wireless charging up to 15 watts, and can deliver up to 30 watts from the USB-C port. The original version made the honorable mentions below, but aside from faster charging, Sharge has added a fold-out stand and shortened it a little, so the IceMag 2 fits perfectly on the back of my iPhone 16. On the downside, the fan still makes a mosquito sound, it gets warm sometimes, and you can’t turn the lights off.SpecsPorts:USB-C x 1, Qi2 wireless chargingCapacity:10,000 mAhCharges:Most phones more than onceWattage:15 watts (wireless), 30 watts (wired)Measurements:4.25 x 2.78 x 0.78 inches, 7.8 ouncesWarranty:1 yearA Solid-State Power BankPhotograph: Simon HillKuxiuS2 Magnetic Solid State Power Bank$50 Amazon$50 KuxiuIt doesn’t look special, but this MagSafe power bank from Kuxiu has a unique selling point: It is a solid-state power bank. Solid-state batteries don’t contain liquids or gel electrolytes, so they are far more stable. This power bank can be dropped, punctured, and exposed to fire without the risk of bursting into flames. Solid-state batteries are also supposed to last longer (they don’t degrade as quickly). They potentially allow for better density, though this 5,000-mAh-capacity power bank is far from the smallest I’ve tried (see Infinacore above). It is Qi2-certified to deliver up to 15 watts wirelessly and has a 20-watt USB-C port. The enhanced safety is welcome, but you pay a little more for it.SpecsPorts:USB-C x 1, Qi2 wireless chargingCapacity:5,000 mAhCharges:Most phones to between 60 and 90 percentWattage:15 watts (wireless), 20 watts (wired)Measurements:4.07 x 2.64 x 0.32 inches, 5.1 ouncesWarranty:1 yearA Rugged Power BankPhotograph: Simon HillPhotograph: Simon HillChevronChevronUAGRugged Wireless Power Bank and Stand$110 $100 (9% off) Amazon$110 $100 (9% off) WalmartWith UAG’s usual rugged aesthetic, this MagSafe power bank meets military drop-test standards (MIL STD 810G 516.6) and scores an IPX6 rating, meaning it can withstand jets of water but not immersion. It is kinda bulky, even for the 10,000-mAh capacity, and it extends slightly from the bottom of my iPhone 16. The USB-C and USB-A ports have covers that can be tricky to open, but I like that they are on either side, because you can use them while you have your iPhone propped up with the fold-out kickstand. Sadly, wireless charging is capped at 10 watts, and wired charging is 20 watts, which is on the slow side. I wouldn’t recommend this at its $110 price, but when discounted, it’s worth a look.SpecsPorts:USB-C x 1, USB-A x 1, Qi wireless chargingCapacity:10,000 mAhCharges:Most phones more than onceWattage:10 watts (wireless), 20 watts (wired)Measurements:4.41 x 2.85 x 0.94 inches, 8.5 ouncesWarranty:1 yearOther MagSafe Power Banks to ConsiderWe like a few other MagSafe power banks that didn’t make it into our top picks.Apple MagSafe Battery for iPhone Air.
Photograph: Julian ChokkattuApple's MagSafe Battery for iPhone Air for $99: The super svelte iPhone Air doesn’t have room for a big battery, so Apple offers this perfectly sized MagSafe add-on, capable of charging wirelessly at 12 watts. But, with just 3,149 mAh of power (it charged the iPhone Air to 68 percent), it’s awfully pricey. Still, it's one of the few perfectly designed for the iPhone Air. You can technically use it with other iPhones, but you'll have to rotate the power bank so that it hangs horizontally.Photograph: Simon HillAnker Nano Power Bank for $46: Anker has almost managed to match the slimmest power bank above with its new Nano Qi2 power bank, measuring just 0.34 inch thick. It keeps its cool, charges at up to 15 watts, and fills most compatible phones to just over the 50 percent mark. If you want a slim Qi2-certified power bank, pick this.Mous MagSafe Compatible Wireless Power Bank for $40: I don’t have any major complaints about this MagSafe power bank. The 6,000-mAh capacity is good for a 70 to 80 percent refill for most iPhones, and the design is rounded with a soft finish, though it is a little thick. It maxes out at 15 watts for charging, with a USB-C port that can hit 20 watts.Vonmählen Evergreen Mag Magnetic Power Bank for £60: The real attraction of this magnetic wireless power bank is Vonmählen’s eco credentials. The German manufacturer uses recycled cobalt (27 percent), aluminum (90 percent), and plastics (100 percent) in its power banks. There are no compromises on design or functionality. This MagSafe battery pack is sleek and slim (8.6 mm), boasts Qi2 certification, and offers 15-watt wireless and 20-watt wired charging via USB-C. It’s only available in the UK and Europe now, but will hopefully land in the US soon.Benks ArmorGo for $43: I love the aramid fiber finish on Benks’ line of MagSafe-compatible power banks, and the 5,000-mAh model is svelte, providing enough power to top off your iPhone and get you through the day. There’s a bulkier 10,000-mAh model if you need more power. Wireless charging is slow at 7.5 watts, while wired charging via the USB-C port is 15 watts. It worked fine in my tests, but there are better options above.Photograph: Simon HillScosche PBQ5MS2 Portable MagSafe Phone Charger for $45: Slim, decent magnets, four LEDs to show remaining power, and a wee USB-C cable in the box—so far, so familiar. There’s nothing really wrong with this 5,000-mAh MagSafe power bank, but charging (wireless and wired) maxes out at 10 watts, and you can get better performers for the same money above.Torras Magnetic Portable Charger With Stand for $50: Our previous ring grip and stand pick, this power bank was supplanted because it can only supply 7.5 watts wirelessly, though you can always plug into the USB-C port for faster charging (up to 18 watts). It is relatively slim and light, has strong magnets, and four LEDs to show the battery level.Burga Magnetic Power Bank for $100: If you are appalled at the idea of attaching an ugly limpet to your iPhone, consider splashing out for one of Burga’s stylish MagSafe power banks. A mix of tempered glass and anodized steel, these pretty power banks come in a wide range of eye-catching designs. The camo model I tested had strong magnets and charged my iPhone 14 Pro wirelessly (7.5 watts) to around 70 percent from dead. The USB-C port can also supply 20 watts. The catch is the relatively high price for the relatively low 5,000-mAh capacity.Groov-e Power Bank for £25: This affordable MagSafe charger is only available in the UK, but it offers a decent 10,000-mAh capacity with a display that shows the precise percentage remaining. You can get 15-watt wireless charging (7.5 watts for iPhones), and the USB-C port can charge devices at up to 20 watts. It’s a little bulky, but the magnets are strong, and it worked well when tested, offering a full charge for my iPhone 14 Pro with around 30 percent left.Belkin BoostCharge Wireless Power Bank for $37: With a 5,000-mAh capacity and a handy kickstand, this MagSafe power bank is decent. I like the choice of colors (especially purple), but the magnets feel a bit weak, and the kickstand works best in landscape (it feels unstable in portrait). It fell well short of a full charge for my iPhone 14 Pro.Bezalel Prelude XR Wireless Power Bank for $79: The clever X range from Bezalel includes two MagSafe power banks and a wireless charging plug. The XR, which I tested, has a 10,000-mAh capacity, while the smaller X ($80) makes do with 5,000 mAh. The XR is bulky, and the kickstand feels flimsy, but it offers more than enough power to fully charge an iPhone 14 Pro. Both power banks charge iPhones at 7.5 watts, and other Qi wireless phones at up to 15 watts, plus you can pop your AirPods on the other side to charge at 3 watts. They also have USB-C ports that can deliver 20 watts.Mophie Snap+ Juice Pack Mini for $45: This 5,000-mAh-capacity power bank works well, but it’s a little bigger than it should be. It works with MagSafe iPhones but comes with an optional attachment for non-MagSafe phones. Mophie's Snap+ Powerstation Stand ($70) offers double the capacity and a kickstand, but it’s chunky.RapidX Boosta Power Bank for $50: Available in some bright colors, this MagSafe power bank delivers 5,000 mAh of power, and there’s an optional charging stand with a USB-C jack that you can slide it onto. This portable charger added a respectable 76 percent to my iPhone 14 Pro’s battery, but the wired USB-C charging is limited to 10 watts.Avoid These MagSafe Power BanksPhotograph: Simon HillSome of the MagSafe portable chargers we tested aren't worth your time.Alogic Matrix Universal Magnetic Power Bank: This lightweight, 5,000-mAh-capacity magnetic power bank has an awkward angular look, but that’s because it’s designed to slide into a 2-in-1 dock, a 3-in-1 dock, and a couple of car docks, much like Anker’s 633 above. Unfortunately, one of the Alogic batteries I tested failed and refused to charge. The one that worked managed to add 74 percent to my iPhone 14 Pro’s battery.HyperJuice Magnetic Wireless Battery Pack: Yet another 5,000-mAh MagSafe power bank, the HyperJuice looks quite nice with four LEDs and a round power button on the back, but the USB-C port is limited to 12 watts, and it only managed to take my iPhone 14 Pro up to 71 percent.UAG Lucent Power Kickstand: This MagSafe power bank has a curved design with a soft-touch coating and a tough metal kickstand. Unfortunately, the capacity is only 4,000 mAh, yet it’s as big as some higher-capacity options—or even bigger. It added just shy of 60 percent to my iPhone 14 Pro, charging wirelessly at 7.5 watts. The USB-C goes up to 18 watts, but you can get better power and performance for the money.Moft Snap Stand Power Set: I like the soft faux leather finish, and this power bank is comfy in the hand and looks great, but the 3,400-mAh capacity only added 41 percent to my iPhone 14 Pro. It comes with a magnetically attached folding stand and wallet, with perhaps enough room for a couple of cards or emergency cash. I like that it attaches separately so you can ditch the power bank when it’s dead, but keep the stand; it just doesn’t offer enough power.Power up with unlimited access to WIRED.
