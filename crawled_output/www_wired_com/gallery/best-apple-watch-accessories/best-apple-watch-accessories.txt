In fact, if you have an iPhone, you probably already have one. It's the best smartwatch and the best fitness tracker for iPhone owners. It dominates the smartwatch category, and Apple just upgraded all three models in the lineup.It's also one of the easiest and most fun Apple products to accessorize. There are tons of different watch faces, and Apple's bands are easy and quick to swap in and out to match different moods or use cases. These screen protectors, cases, and straps can help extend the life of your watch; they can also help dress your constant wrist companion up or down. We also suggest getting Apple's extended warranty plan, given that service pricing for watch repairs is exorbitant.Still haven’t decided which model to get? Read our Best Apple Watch guide, and check out our Best Apple 3-in-1 Chargers for smart ways to keep all your devices recharged.Updated September 2025: We've added a note on fluoroelastomer, the Nike sport loop, the Nomad Tempo band, the Konsu NYC watch band, the Wrangler leather watch bands, the Hopo bracelet band, the Machete bracelet band, and the Zzdzz magnetic band.How to Figure Out Your Apple Watch Band SizeAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronDo you have an Apple Watch Series 8? Or a Series 9? What size bands did it support again? If you're not sure, don't worry. It's very easy to figure out what band size to buy for your Apple Watch. Just turn it over, and around the heart rate sensor, you'll see exactly what model you have, and the strap size will be listed next to it.A Note on PFASAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronA study published in December 2024 found that many smartwatch wrist bands contain high levels of PFHxA. This is a “forever chemical” that can affect your immune, thyroid, kidney, and reproductive systems. Unfortunately, Apple's sport bands are made from fluoroelastomer, which is the material that has the highest levels of PFHxA. They're attractive and durable, but we do not recommend them here. Silicone, nylon, metal, leather, or other materials do not contain PFAS.The Best Charging StandPhotograph: Simon HillBelkin3-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand$130 $110 (15% off) Amazon$110 Best Buy$130 Apple$110 BelkinEven though Apple has markedly improved the battery life on the Apple Watch in 2025, it still won't last for a week on a single charge. To keep your watch reliably charged while also wearing it to track your sleep, you must seed your house with Apple Watch chargers so that you can top it off in between other activities. The best 3-in-1 charger is Belkin's classy Qi2 charging stand, which uses the Qi2 fast wireless charging standard and can fast-charge a Watch Series 7 or newer. I also love Satechi's compact folding charger.Choose This Apple BandPhotograph: Adrienne SoPhotograph: Adrienne SoChevronChevronNikeSport Loop$49 AppleWhen you buy your Apple Watch, you get to choose which band you get. Skip the rubber bands, which are made from fluoroelastomer. While the company committed to removing PFAS from its products in 2022, we have not gotten confirmation that Apple’s products are PFAS-free.I find the textile and metal bands to be much more attractive and comfortable than fluoroelastomer bands, which tend to trap sweat and irritate my skin. My favorite of the Apple bands you can choose at checkout this year is the Nike nylon woven Sport Loop. It's soft, breathable, soaks up sweat, and is infinitely adjustable if your wrists swell when you run. It's made from recycled polyester, spandex, and nylon, and the yarn is reflective if you're running at night. It comes in five colors and three sizes, so it's compatible with the 40-, 44-, and 46-mm watch sizes.If You Must Have FluoroelastomerCourtesy of NomadNomadTempo Band$55 NomadMany companies, including Apple, have been working on PFAS-free fluoroelastomer bands. That includes Nomad, which makes some of our favorite Apple accessories. Nomad has confirmed that the newest Tempo bands are made from PFAS-free fluoroelastomer, so if you really must have a fluoroelastomer band—against all considerations of safety, comfort, and, I must say, style—this is a good band to get.I have two caveats: The Tempo band is just so slightly too big for my 150-mm wrist, and Nomad hedges its bets with sizing by making each band backward-compatible with two sizes—for example, the smallest size is compatible with both 41 and 42 mm watch sizes. This doesn't quite work if you have the older, smaller-size watch, as I find the bands to be just a little too big. Happily, the Tempo band fits my 46-mm Series 10 well.Best Dress-Watch BandPhotograph: Adrienne SoPhotograph: Adrienne SoChevronChevronKonsu NYCLeather Watch Band$139 Konsu NYCThis band from Konsu NYC is the most beautiful band I've ever worn. The top and bottom layers of the strap are 100 percent soft, beautiful calfskin leather, and the middle layer is made from a proprietary thin, strong fiber. It feels like leather to the touch but is incredibly soft and supple. The hardware is double-polished stainless steel. The colors are also incredible. My band is Moher Green, inspired by Ireland’s Cliffs of Moher, and it's a much deeper, vibrant green than comes across even in these photos.The Best Black Watch Ultra BandPhotograph: Adrienne SoAppleMilanese Titanium Band$199 Amazon$199 AppleThe Apple Watch Ultra 2 came in a black finish, which was matched by this special black titanium Milanese loop. The standout feature (I know, I know) is the parachute-style buckle, which Apple claims was historically used for diving and other underwater activities. (I seem to remember that most water activities use ratchet tie downs and threaded cam buckles for straps, but I will let this slide.) The buckle is very smooth and satisfying to clip in and out when you're on a phone call or in a meeting. The titanium doesn't irritate my skin, and the band is smooth and easy to adjust. It's carbon-neutral, and it looks very, very good. It turns your sporty watch into a much dressier watch.The Second Best Watch Ultra BandPhotograph: Adrienne SoPhotograph: Adrienne SoChevronChevronAppleTrail Loop$99 Amazon$99 AppleThe Watch Ultra 3 has several band varieties for different rugged sports: the Alpine Loop ($99) for climbing, the Ocean Band ($99) for diving and surfing, the aforementioned Milanese Loop for looking badass, and the Trail Loop for trail running. Since trail running is my sport, the Trail Loop is also my favorite band. (It is just like the Nike Sport Loop, except bigger.) I like that the green version has hints of neon that go with the new neon Exactograph face.The Best CablePhotograph: Simon HillNomadUniversal Cable for Apple Watch$85 Amazon$85 NomadAs my colleague Simon Hill says in his Best USB-C Cables guide, this Nomad cable is way too expensive. However, it is undeniably handy—pack a single cable for your iPhone and your Apple Watch. It's Kevlar-reinforced, and the braided finish is nice. You can also charge your AirPods on the charging puck as well as your Apple Watch.The Best Workout HeadphonesPhotograph: Ryan WaniataBeatsPowerbeats Pro 2$249 Amazon$200 Walmart$250 Apple$250 StaplesNot only are the Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) the best workout headphones if you have an Apple Watch, they are the best workout headphones, period. They even have a heart rate monitor that's built off the one used in the Apple Watch! If you already own an Apple Watch, this feature is superfluous, as iOS will prioritize the Apple Watch's more sophisticated readings over the earbuds. But if you run with third-party fitness apps like Nike Run Club or Peloton, you will find the extra data useful.On top of that, the buds are crazy comfortable, sound great, have excellent noise canceling, and have most of the aforementioned Apple-exclusive features, like hands-free Siri (no Adaptive Audio, however, sad). The case also sports wireless charging and, unlike many of Apple's other products, it comes in bright, fun colors. Our test unit is Electric Orange, but I find the Hyper Purple to be just as good.The Best Workout AppCourtesy of AppleAppleFitness+$9 AppleI am guessing you wanted an Apple Watch in part because you needed a fitness tracker. I run, swim, and rock climb, and I think that the Apple Watch is currently one of the best running watches available. Most great fitness apps work on the Apple Watch, like Strava, Peloton, or Nike Run Club. However, if you're firmly ensconced in the Apple walled garden, the best fitness app is probably Apple's Fitness+, which seamlessly interacts between the Watch, the iPhone, and the Apple TV+.I like it mainly because it's included with my family's Apple One subscription, but it's also incredibly convenient. There is now coaching for outdoor walks and runs (although there is another Apple app I use for this, which is Podcasts). The workouts are unintimidating, and a lot of them are very short. Those five minutes when I was not responding to your Slack? I was probably doing a five-minute core workout! Sorry, it's just hard for me to sit still! For more fitness apps and services, check out our roundup.A Silly Leather BandPhotograph: Adrienne SoPhotograph: Adrienne SoChevronChevronWranglerRanch Rider Calf Hair Band$35 Amazon$35 WithItHear me out: I was prepared to hate this entire Western-themed collection, which is a collaboration between Wrangler and the accessory company WithIt. It includes seven bands of all different materials, from a turquoise-and-silver bracelet band to a denim band. But I was unexpectedly charmed by the Rodeo Ready, which is made from calf hair (which I'm guessing has been bleached and dyed, since no cows have speckles this small). It can be sized to fit all Apple Watch models, from the older 38-mm versions to the Watch Ultra 1 through 3. It is comfortable and tacky, in a good way, especially if you're wearing a bunch of silver bangles and beads and patting a horse.The Best Travel Power BankPhotograph: Simon HillOneAdaptrOneGo 3-in-1 Power Bank$99 $89 (10% off) OneAdaptrA travel power bank is handy when you're out and about with your watch for any length of time and don't have access to a wall outlet. I have the Journey Glyde 4-in-1 power bank ($170), which also has a 10,000-mAh capacity and adheres to the Qi2 wireless charging standard. However, my colleague Simon's pick is just as compact, much cheaper, and doubles as a kickstand, even if you can't plug devices into it with a cable.A Magnetic StrapPhotograph: Adrienne SoPhotograph: Adrienne SoChevronChevronZzdzzSilicone Magnetic Strap$20 AmazonMy Instagram feed is bombarded with ads for easy-to-put-on adjustable silicone straps, so I bought this cheap one off Amazon. The colors are vibrant, and it is, indeed, very comfortable and easy to put on and adjust. However, the flip side of that is that it falls off very easily, and I can't vouch for its durability. Also, the little loop that holds the strap down isn't attached to the band at any point, so I lose it constantly. Whatever! It's $20!Best Band StorageCourtesy of Twelve SouthTwelve SouthTimePorter Watch Band Wall Mount$27 Amazon$40 Twelve South$40 AppleEven the most restrained and minimalist among us probably have at least two bands: a nylon sport loop for everyday wear, and a titanium or steel band for when you have to dress up. (You will still probably look hopelessly dorky, but one can hope.)You could always keep your spare bands in a shoebox on your dresser, but I really like this hanger from Twelve South. The wall mount is incredibly easy to install—just make sure you're not hanging it upside down and stick it on your wall. The bands slot neatly in a compressive groove at the top. Each holder fits up to six bands, but you can easily add more if your collection is bigger than mine.The Smallest CasePhotograph: AmazonHontaoUltra Thin Case$8 AmazonUnlike a phone, a watch is worn on your wrist, so every millimeter of real estate counts. If all you want is a thin, affordable, and attractive bumper that will protect your watch from bumps and bangs throughout the day, this is my favorite. It's made from a matte thermoplastic urethane (TPU) that is extremely thin and fits a 41-mm watch well. The dark green color I tried is well represented by the images on the website. However, reviews say the lighter colors show dirt very easily, so I would stick with darker shades.★ Alternative: The Spigen Thin Fit ($15) is also a very nice, minimal case. But it's a bit pricier, and the plastic is not as soft to the touch.Best Screen ProtectorCourtesy of AmazonLKApple Watch Screen Protector$10 AmazonAs with straps, the best protector is not always the brand-name option or the most expensive one. I tried screen protectors from Spigen and Zagg, but when I pushed or pulled a case on over them, the thin films peeled off or bubbled almost instantly. This screen protector—also made from TPU—was easy to apply and looks invisible once it's on.I particularly like the small rubber installation pad, which held the watch much more securely than other installation plates. Even if it's reasonably easy to use, I recommend watching the short instructional video before putting the screen protector on. Don't worry—if you mess up, it includes several replacements.The Best Action CameraPhotograph: Scott GilbertsonPhotograph: Scott GilbertsonPhotograph: Scott GilbertsonPhotograph: Scott GilbertsonChevronChevronInsta360X5 360 Camera$550 Amazon$550 B&H Photo$550 AdoramaYou can overlay your fitness stats over your video while filming with the Insta360 X series. Simply connect the camera to your Insta360 X5 and authorize the Insta360 app to connect to Apple Health. The Insta360 X5 also connects to Garmin and GPS devices. Great for any vlogger showing the world their fitness journey.Avoid These AccessoriesCourtesy of NomadApple Solo Loop for $49:  Apple really hawks its precisely sized Solo Loops, which form a single loop around your wrist. But they're expensive, and as an active person, I can't size them correctly. They're always too tight when I'm working out and too loose when I'm not. I prefer an adjustable band.Hopo Resin Band for $14: My mom has this gorgeous Machete Apple Watch tortoiseshell resin bracelet band ($80), so I figured I'd do her one better and order the cheap one off Amazon. It's a no-go—the included pin remover is too short, so I can't take links out to make the band smaller. I will just get the Machete band next time.Zagg InvisibleShield GlassFusion Screen Protector for $30:  There is no earthly reason why this screen protector should be so expensive. It also bubbled within several days.CommentsBack to topTriangleAdrienne So is a senior commerce editor for WIRED, where she reviews health and fitness gear.
