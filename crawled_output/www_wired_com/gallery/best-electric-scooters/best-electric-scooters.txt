While riding might not be the flashiest way to get around, reducing our reliance on gas-guzzling cars is cool and important. If bikes or electric bikes aren't your thing, escooters are another eco-friendly way to travel short distances without burning fossil fuel. They're easy to fold up and are lighter than ebikes (usually), and you don't need to wait for public transportation.We've spent five years testing over 45 electric scooters, and these are our favorites. A mind-melting number of companies and escooter models arrive every year, so we're constantly evaluating new models. Need a helmet or phone mount? I have recommendations for those, as well.Updated September 2025: We've added the Segway ZT3 Pro and Niu KQi 200F.What Kind of Scooter Tires Are Best?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronA few scooters mentioned in this guide have multiple tire options. You'll most commonly come across these two terms: pneumatic tires and solid tires. The former, which are filled with air, come in two variants—tubed and tubeless.Solid tires are made of solid material, like rubber or silicone, and require very little maintenance. However, they don't absorb bumps in the road that well, so you won't get the smoothest or grippiest ride. If you're in a city with mostly nice roads, you're taking short trips, and you go less than 20 mph, this is a completely fine option.Tubed tires have an inner tube that holds the air and an exterior rubber tire to protect it. That means you'll need to regularly check the pressure in your tires, like on a bike. These are usually easy to replace if you get a flat, and you most likely will, as tubed tires aren't very puncture-resistant.Tubeless tires don't have an inner tube—an airtight seal keeps the air in—and that allows for higher-quality, thicker, and tougher tires (though not as tough as solid tires). You'll still need to keep an eye on air pressure. These are usually found on pricier escooters, but like the tubed counterpart, it's what you want if you prioritize ride quality. I prefer tubeless tires, as they offer a comfier ride and are less likely to get a flat.Why Is My Scooter Battery Inconsistent?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronThe battery meter on the display of your electric scooter might not be reliable. The bars dip really low when you ride uphill, and they suddenly flood back full when you go downhill. These meters show voltage. When the motor is working hard, the voltage drops as the motor pulls power from the battery. This can be anxiety-inducing if you go up a hill and suddenly see you only have two bars left. You might think you won't have enough juice to make it home. Over time, you'll get a better idea of your scooter's range, but until then, I recommend carrying the charger with you when possible. Escooters usually take six or so hours to fully recharge, but even an hour of recharging at the coffee shop might add just enough for your return trip.Before You Ride, Read ThisAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronScooters are electric vehicles, so there are a few things you should and shouldn't do if you get one. First, if you've never ridden an electric scooter and are nervous about shelling out for one, try a rideshare service. Companies like Lime, Lyft, and Bird let you grab an escooter for not a lot of money, which is a good way to test the waters.Wear a helmet. Need I say more? Protect your noggin. I like the Thousand Heritage helmet, Giro Ethos Mips, and the Beam Virgo, which is a full-face helmet I use for speedier scooters. Read our Best Bike Helmets for more recommendations, and follow this guide to fit your helmet the right way.Check your local laws. Are electric scooters legal where you live? If so, what's the maximum speed limit? Do you have to be in the bike lane? Over the last few years, escooters have become a common sight in many cities. Chances are, your state or city has spelled out rules about riding them.Don't charge your escooter overnight or when no one is home. The manuals of several scooters I've tested say the same. Not every battery or charger has a UL certification for safety, and I've seen one too many stories of battery fires. Always be around when you're charging your scooter, and unplug it when it's finished charging.Try to avoid the rain. You'll want to check your scooter to see whether it has official IP water- and dust-resistance ratings. If not, avoid riding in the rain. If there is a rating, it's still a good idea to get out of the rain quickly. More importantly, do not plug the charger in without wiping down the charging port and ensuring it's dry.Be wary of potholes. My first and only accident on an electric scooter was thanks to a deep pothole. I noticed it too late. If you're driving a car, you'd probably try and avoid a pothole, so do the same with a scooter.Don't store your escooter in excessive temperatures. Extreme heat and extreme cold are not good for batteries. Store your escooter indoors in a cool, dry place, like you would your breakfast cereal! Avoid riding it in these temperatures as well.One rider only, please. Unless a manufacturer explicitly states that an escooter can carry two people, only one rider should be on the deck. These vehicles can go pretty fast, and you don't need to go more than 20 mph to be in a serious accident. It's also a good idea to check the weight limit on your scooter.Check the manufacturer's servicing and repair options. Before investing in a new scooter, check if the manufacturer offers spare parts or can service your scooter if any issues arise. You may want to connect with local ebike and escooter shops to see if they have experience with the brand you're going with.Don't leave your escooter unattended outdoors. Scooters aren't easy to secure, so they're easy to steal. Roll them indoors if you need to, but keep them within sight if you don't want to walk home, helmet in hand. Make sure you are allowed to bring them indoors if you plan on taking them somewhere. I've been denied entry in some buildings in New York City with a scooter. If you have to lock it up, our Best Bike Locks guide has several locks that will also work with scooters.Can You Swap Your Scooter's Battery?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronIf your scooter has been well-used for several years, you've likely noticed the shorter battery life compared to when you first bought it. Just like a smartphone, these batteries degrade over time. The good news is that replacing the battery isn't very difficult. You can usually remove a few screws on the deck, unplug the old battery, plug in the new one, and affix the deck back again. Check YouTube or your manufacturer's website to find instructions for your model (make sure you're not voiding a warranty!).The trick is sourcing the battery. You'll want to make sure you're using UL-listed components and batteries recommended by your scooter manufacturer, which makes it all the more reason to stick with a reputable brand that carries spare parts for a long time.How I Test Electric ScootersAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronI test-ride every electric scooter for several weeks. I unbox and assemble them myself and use them to attend meetings around New York City or for simple errands like going to the post office or grocery store. I keep a log of my distance traveled to measure range, and I often do the same type of trip with every scooter (if it is capable of that range), which usually involves going up a steep path like on the Williamsburg Bridge. This gives me an idea of how the scooter handles slopes.It's worth noting that electric scooters will work a bit differently for everyone. The rider's weight greatly impacts range and performance, as will the weather and road conditions. For reference, I'm a 6'4" human and weigh around 250 pounds, which means if you are shorter and weigh less, you'll get longer range and will more easily reach the top speed on some of these escooters.Best OverallPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuApolloGo (2024)$1,099 $899 (18% off) Amazon$1,249 $899 (28% off) Best Buy$1,249 $899 (28% off) ApolloFor anyone looking to make the most of their trips around town on an electric kick scooter, I recommend the Apollo Go (8/10, WIRED Recommends). It's not the lightest scooter, not the fastest, nor does it have the longest range, but it triangulates these points to offer the best combination of specs. At 46 pounds, carrying the Apollo Go up a few flights of stairs isn't a back-killing task. It folds down with a simple latch system (though the latch requires some force to pull down), and the stem locks into the deck.The riding experience is excellent, with plenty of power from the dual 350-watt motors. Self-healing 9-inch tubeless tires pair with front and rear suspension to offer a decently smooth ride. I also love the ability to customize the gears to your preferred speeds via Apollo's app. Don't care for the 28-mph top speed and want to only ride at 15 mph? Set it up in the app and you're good to go! I also maxed out the regenerative braking in the app, so I rarely had to use the rear drum brake and just used the regen thumb brake to come to a quick halt. Apollo includes a lot of extras, too, like a bell, excellent turn signals, LED lighting for visibility, a headlight, and a dot display that is super visible in broad daylight. The Apollo Go is a great all-around escooter and an excellent first ride for anyone looking to enter the world of micromobility.SpecsTop speed: 28 mphMotor: Dual 350-watt motorsWeight: 46 poundsMax load: 265 poundsIP rating: IP66WIRED's tested range: Around 15 milesManufacturer's range: 20 to 30 milesBest Commuter ScooterPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuSegwayMax G3$1,300 $1,200 (8% off) Amazon$1,400 $1,200 (14% off) Segway$1,500 $1,200 (20% off) Best BuySegway's Max G3 is nearly identical in price to the Apollo Go, but it offers more power and range with a weight trade-off. That extra oomph is enough to make it reliable for longer commutes, like if you're scooting to the office and back home. But my favorite part of the Max G3 is its 3.5-hour recharge time. I've had so many situations where I did not take my scooter somewhere because I forgot to charge it, and it needed six or 12 hours to get back to full. That hasn't been an issue with this Segway—just pop it on the charger and roughly three hours later, you're good to go. Even better is that the charger doesn't have a giant AC brick attached. It's a simple, lightweight cable that's easy to pack, so you can quickly recharge at the office or even a coffee shop.I predominantly rode the scooter in Drive mode, which maxes the top speed at 16 mph. You can put it in Sport to go 20 mph, and if you unlock the speed boost in the app, you can max out at 28 mph. Drive mode was plenty for me (and legal in New York City), and it enabled a healthy range without worrying about the battery dying. I ended my trip from Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn, to 36th street in Midtown and then back home with around 25 percent remaining, roughly 18 miles, and I could probably go an extra mile or two further. Speeds decreased a smidge going up the slope of the Williamsburg Bridge, though that didn't happen in Sport mode. It's plenty powerful. The 11-inch self-sealing tires, paired with the dual hydraulic suspension, also make for a relatively smooth ride.It's easy to set up, the Segway app has many customization options, and folding the scooter is a breeze. At 54 pounds, carrying it up a few flights of stairs is manageable. The Max G3 has built-in turn signals, which I always appreciate, and the front and rear disc brakes offer adequate stopping power. The TFT display on the handlebars is bright and can even show details like Caller ID and navigation via Here Maps when connected to your smartphone. I like having the option, but Here kept offering routes without bicycle lanes, so I just stuck with Google Maps on my phone.SpecsTop speed: 20 mph (default), 28 mph unlockable via appMotor: 850-watt motorWeight: 54.2 poundsMax load: 286 poundsIP rating: IPX6WIRED's tested range: Around 19 miles (in Drive mode)Manufacturer's range: 40 miles (in Drive mode)For City SlickersPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuChevronChevronSegwayNinebot F3 Electric Scooter$850 Amazon$850 Walmart$1,000 $850 (15% off) SegwayThe Segway F3 checks off a lot of boxes. The app experience is feature-rich, it has turn signals and a bell, and it can hit 20 miles per hour on its highest-speed mode. It's also not too heavy at 42 pounds, yet still maintains 10-inch self-sealing tubeless tires that do a decent job of making bumpy roads feel less harsh, aided by front and rear suspension. It's simple to fold up, though not quite as seamless as Niu's folding system. The display gets nice and bright, and the hydraulic brake comes to a quick stop. It's very comfy to ride, and it has just enough power to climb some small slopes, though your top speed will drop.These conveniences come with a sacrifice: range. It doesn't go as far as the Apollo Go or Niu KQi 300X (see below), both of which have dipped close to the MSRP of the Segway F3 during sale events. I eked out a little more than 10 miles, though most people should be able to get closer to 15 or more. When this escooter eventually goes on sale, I think it'll be a much better value at, say, $600 instead of $850. Still, I thoroughly enjoyed my time scootering around town on this thing, and for most people living in a city where every amenity is already nearby, it'll do the job.SpecsTop speed: 20 mphMotor: 450-watt motorWeight: 42 poundsMax load: 265 poundsIP rating: IPX6WIRED's tested range: Just above 10 milesManufacturer's range: 25 milesA Great All-Terrain ScooterPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuNiu KQi 300X$1,198 Amazon$1,299 Best Buy$1,299 $1,198 (8% off) NiuNiu's KQi 300X is an all-terrain upgraded version of the older KQi3 Pro, which was my top-recommended scooter for some time. This model has a just-as-easy-to-use folding mechanism, and when you fold the stem down, it locks into place at the deck automatically. It weighs a bit more at 49 pounds, but the stem is thin, so it's easy to grasp and carry up a flight of stairs.It's a well-rounded riding experience that rivals the Apollo Go, with great suspension and thick 10.5-inch tubeless tires. The dual disc brakes come to a quick stop, though I set the regenerative braking to the max and relied on it most of the time. I rode the Williamsburg Bridge in Brooklyn back and forth, and it hardly skipped a beat. By default, it goes up to 20 miles per hour, but if you pair it with the Niu app, you can unlock the fastest 23-mph speed. The range is noticeably better than the older model, and I measured this while typically riding at its top speed, meaning if you limit the speed, you'll be able to go further.My only gripe is that there are no quick speed modes to cycle through on the display—you're stuck with “E-Save” mode, which goes up to 10 mph, and then the default mode, which goes up to 23 mph. In the app, you can enable a Dynamic mode that lets you set a custom speed, but weirdly, when you switch to this via the display, it flashes “E-Save” mode to indicate it's turned on. It's not very intuitive. I wish there were basic modes to choose from without hopping into the app. You also get turn signals, but they're annoyingly not time-based and don't turn off automatically. Enticed by the 300X? It's worth considering the Niu KQi 300P; it's nearly identical but has a slightly lesser motor and range at a lower price.SpecsTop speed: 23 mphMotor: 500-watt motorWeight: 49 poundsMax load: 265 poundsIP rating: IP55WIRED's tested range: Around 16 milesManufacturer's range: 37 milesBest Lightweight ScooterPhotograph: Unagi ScootersUnagi Model One Voyager$79 Unagi (Rent)The Unagi Model One Voyager (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is a slick scooter weighing just 30 pounds, but it can hit a top speed of 15 miles per hour and can handle slopes pretty well. (You can unlock a 20-mph speed.) I was able to get 10 miles of range, but most people will be able to get a little more. Having such a lightweight vehicle makes it a great last-mile option when paired with public transportation. It's much easier to carry up or down flights of stairs than many other scooters in this guide, and it doesn't take up much room on the train. It helps that the folding system is fast and simple, and it recharges quickly (50 percent in one hour), so you can top it up while enjoying breakfast at the coffee shop.Downsides? Excluding the limited range, the 7.5-inch solid rubber tires don't do a great job of mitigating bumps and holes, so try to stick to flat roads. Unfortunately, Unagi seems to have removed the ability to buy the scooter outright. You can only rent it now for $79 per month, though this does include maintenance and theft protection. While I strongly prefer owning my own ride, you might find it more hassle-free to rent and have access to Unagi's service team if an issue crops up.Specs:Top speed: 15 mphMotor: Dual 250-watt motorWeight: 30 poundsMax load: 220 poundsIP rating: IPX4WIRED's tested range: Around 10 milesManufacturer's range: 31 milesBest Budget ScooterPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuSegwayE2 Pro$600 $430 (28% off) Amazon$500 $430 (14% off) Walmart$600 $430 (28% off) Best Buy$600 $430 (28% off) SegwayThe Segway E2 Pro isn't going to get you very far. I traveled less than 10 miles on a single charge (though most people weigh less than I and can get better range). It's heavier than it looks, at 41 pounds, but it's quick to fold down and easy to carry by the stem. I've had no problem trotting around my neighborhood with this scooter and its 350-watt motor, which has a top speed of 15 mph and does a decent job on small slopes. It's fairly steady on bumpy roads thanks to the 10-inch tubeless tires, and the front drum brake and rear electronic brake reliably bring this vehicle to a stop fairly quickly. It's worth noting that, as a safety precaution, you have to pair it with Segway's app to unlock the full speed.My favorite addition is the turn signals, which you can easily access on the handlebar—I just wish there were a timer to automatically stop the blinkers after a few seconds, because you have to manually turn them off. Overall, the E2 Pro is a nice upgrade pick over the E2 Plus, which was my previous budget recommendation. If you're looking to spend very little, take a look at the Niu 100P, which I talk about further below. It costs around $379.SpecsTop speed: 15.5 mphMotor: 350-watt motorWeight: 41 poundsMax load: 265 poundsIP rating: IPX4WIRED's tested range: Around 10 milesManufacturer's range: 16.8 milesMy Favorite Electric ScooterPhotograph: SpeedwayDualtron USARovoron Cute$1,299 Dualtron USA$1,249 $1,049 (16% off) WellbotsIf I had to buy one scooter in this guide, I'd pick the Rovoron Cute. This is nearly identical to the Speedway Mini 4 Pro (9/10, WIRED Recommends) I reviewed in 2022, but it has a slightly larger battery, so you can expect even better range than what I initially got with the Speedway (around 15 miles).I like it so much because, similar to the Apollo Go, it has an excellent blend of range, speed, and weight. It can go up to 28 miles per hour, but you're better off sticking to the second mode that hovers around 18 to 20 mph. It crushed the steep Williamsburg Bridge without dropping in speed much, and I've been able to take it more or less anywhere I want to go on an escooter. Best of all, it weighs just 36 pounds, is easy to fold, and the handlebars fold down, making it compact and simple to carry at a moment's whim. You get front and rear LEDs, but you'll need to supply a bell, and there are no turn signals. There's a little display by the right handlebar that shows speedometer data, but thankfully, there's no app to worry about.SpecsTop speed: 28 mphMotor: 500-watt motorWeight: 36 poundsMax load: 265 poundsIP rating: NoneWIRED's tested range: Around 15 milesManufacturer's range: 35 milesIf You Have a GaragePhotograph: Julian ChokkattuPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuChevronChevronApolloPhantom 2.0$2,999 $2,199 (27% off) ApolloYes. The Apollo Phantom 2.0 weighs 102 pounds. This was the heaviest electric scooter I tested until I tried Segway's GT3 Pro SuperScooter. Let's just say I'm thankful I don't live in a walkup anymore. I still have a few steps outside my front door, and it's even a pain to move the Phantom up and down those, which is why I think you should only consider this vehicle if you have a ramp or a garage. Or if you're Superman.With great weight comes great comfort. This gorgeous escooter sports thick, 11-inch self-healing tubeless tires and has a dual-spring suspension system. I've gone over terrible roads here in Brooklyn, and it's a piece of cake for the Phantom 2.0. Power is at your fingertips, especially in the third speed mode, which can go up to 34 mph (you can unlock a Ludo mode to go up to 44 in the app), but I mostly cruised in Normal mode at 22 mph. There's greater torque in Sport, though, and sometimes I'd switch modes with a press of a button to vault myself from traffic lights quicker. I don't need to go faster than 20 mph, which translates to great range. I routinely went from Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn, to Midtown Manhattan and back, and had just under 50 percent in the tank. That trip is about 18 to 20 miles! It crushes hills easily, too.Folding it up doesn't take long, just know there's an extra locking mechanism at the bottom of the stem—I didn't realize it initially, and was confused as to why the scooter wasn't folding. (Oops!) Apollo's app is super easy to use, and there are quite a few customizations you can make to the scooter, not to mention built-in Apple Find My, so you can track the Phantom's location.The only thing other than the weight that I don't love is the QuadLock mount baked into the center of the handlebar, which means you have to invest in QuadLock's phone mount. Apollo's Dot 2.0 display can also still be a little hard to read in harsh sunlight.SpecsTop speed: 44 mphMotor: Dual 1,750-watt motorsWeight: 102 poundsMax load: 330 poundsIP rating: IP66WIRED's tested range: More than 20 milesManufacturer's range: 50 milesFor Serious RidersPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuSegwayGT3 Pro SuperScooter$2,700 SegwayI'll be the first to admit that the Segway GT3 Pro SuperScooter is not for me. It's serious overkill, designed for enthusiasts looking to take advantage of its 50 mph speeds, 3.9-second acceleration from zero to 30 mph, and the fantastic range. The latter is my favorite part of this SuperScooter—I took a 16-mile trip from Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn, to Manhattan and back, and the battery only dropped down to 71 percent. That's amazing, though I mostly stuck to riding around 20 mph. (I have never found a need to go much faster than that.)The ride is incredibly stable, even on Brooklyn's rough roads, thanks to the dual hydraulic suspension system, and the hydraulic disc brakes are very responsive. My main gripe, aside from the ridiculous 117-pound weight of the vehicle, is that the throttle response can feel a little choppy in Race mode. That's largely because there's so much torque, it can be hard to get a handle on exactly how fast you want to go (unless you have a clear open road in front of you). I usually stuck to Sport mode, which wasn't as intense but still had the torque I wanted. I also don't really like this style of twist throttle. I prefer a thumb throttle as it gives me finer control over the speed without hurting my wrists.This is a decked-out scooter with all the tech you'd want, from solid anti-theft capabilities (including Apple Find My support) to customizable speeds via the slick app. If you don't mind the weight and want the power, you'll probably enjoy the GT3 Pro. Just make sure you wear a motorcycle helmet.SpecsTop speed: 50 mphMotor: Dual 3,500-watt motorsWeight: 117 poundsMax load: 330 poundsIP rating: IPX6WIRED's tested range: Well more than 20 milesManufacturer's range: 45 miles (in Sport)Other Scooters to ConsiderI've tested many scooters. Not all deserve a spot above, but some are still worth considering.Photograph: Julian ChokkattuNiu KQi 200F for $799: The KQi 200F offers a very similar experience to the Segway F3 ($850). The F3 costs a little more, but it edges out the Niu enough that I think it's worth the money. But if you like Niu's products, the 200F is a nice way to get around town. It's slightly heavier (44 pounds), and while it matches the F3 in top speed (20 mph), the weaker 350-watt motor meant my speeds dropped to 13 mph as I went up slight slopes. My top speed was usually around 18 mph instead of 20. The drum brake is solid, though it doesn't come to a full stop as fast as I'd like, and the 10-inch tubeless tires pair with the front spring suspension for a decently comfy ride. I was able to eke out around 10 miles of range. It folds down quickly and is easy to carry, and you get nice perks like turn signals, a bell, and a front light. I'm not a fan of the deck—it was a little too short for me, but it's the tacky design that's really off-putting. (No, I don't want "Life is a crazy ride" plastered on my deck.)Niu KQi 100P
Photograph: Julian ChokkattuNiu KQi 100P for $379: The KQi 100P is slightly lighter, cheaper, and faster than the Segway E2 Pro, my top budget recommendation, but I eked out slightly less range (under 5 miles). Granted, most people will be able to go a little further since you're probably not 6'4" and 250 pounds, but the Niu just has a smaller battery than the Segway. I also prefer having turn signals, which are absent on the Niu, and Segway's app is nicer. The KQi 100P's 300-watt motor has slightly less power, which means slower starts, but this scooter has performed very well for its frequently discounted price of $379. If you want to spend as little as possible and need a transport option for nearby grocery stores or toting around your college campus, this one will do the job.Photograph: Julian ChokkattuSegway ZT3 Pro for $1,000: The ZT3 Pro is an off-road scooter, so it's perfect for all the terrible roads here in Brooklyn. I was delivering Christmas cookies to some friends and used the ZT3 Pro to trek from Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn, to lower Manhattan, then back into Brooklyn to stop by Greenpoint, and finally head back home (that's two bridges!). It was roughly 16 miles—in the last mile or two, the ZT3 Pro began lowering its speed and was on its final battery bar, but I made it to my house. No need to do the dead scooter walk of shame! I rode it at the second speed mode, which limited it to 15 miles per hour, but the 650-watt motor can go up to 25 mph. It folds up easily, though I wish the stem had a more secure latch when it's down. You get turn signals, a bright headlamp, and a bell. But what's most impressive is the suspension. I went over some small potholes and did not feel the vibrations as deeply in my bones as on other scooters I've tested. That's also likely thanks to the large 11-inch tubeless tires. The only main problem I had with it was its weight. At nearly 66 pounds, it's manageable for a flight of stairs or two, but it gets tiring quickly. I also find the newer Max G3 matches the ZT3 Pro in many ways and outpaces it in others, making the ZT3 Pro feel redundant. However, the ZT3 Pro does fully recharge in four hours.Dualtron USA Togo Scooter
Photograph: Julian ChokkattuDualtron USA Togo for $499: If you can buy this scooter at the discounted price I've seen it drop to—$499—I think it's phenomenal value. At $850, not so much. I went from Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn, over the Brooklyn Bridge into lower Manhattan and back home on a single charge, a roughly 13-mile trek, and it was out of battery. The ride feels stiff, and this scooter must be designed for shorter people, as my arms had to be fully outstretched to reach the handlebars. A safety feature locks the throttle after a few seconds (you can turn this off in the app), and you need to press both brakes to unlock it. I initially found it annoying, but now I don't mind it—an accidental press of the throttle won't send this thing flying. I rode it at 15 mph, but it can hit 25. However, my trek back home wasn't that fun. The scooter, despite saying I had 30 percent left, began slowing down when I was still a few miles away, so I had to ride home at an agonizingly slow 8 mph earlier than I expected. The battery gauge is very useless; it would say I had 78 percent at one point, then minutes later, it would say 40 percent. The max load is only 220 pounds, so shorter and lighter people than me will get better range, but it's a solid little scooter, especially for under $500 on sale. It weighs 54 pounds.TurboAnt M10 Lite for $280: This is a perfectly fine budget scooter best for folks under 200 pounds. (I wasn't able to hit its top speed of 16 mph.) The assembly requires a few extra steps (more things to screw in, like the rear mudguard). I was only able to get around 8 miles riding it, but I like that the folding system is quick, the display is bright, and it's pretty light at 31 pounds. Just don't take it up any steep hills.Gotrax Apex for $319: The Apex is 32 pounds and easy to fold up. It has an integrated bell and a digital display that shows your speed and battery life, and it can go up to 15 mph. The Apex is reliable—I've gone to coffee shops, remote video shoots with a backpack full of camera gear, and the grocery store, though it's not the smoothest ride. The 250-watt motor struggles with any slight incline, and slopes drain the battery fast. The battery usually lasted around 9 miles for me. I'm also tall, and I had to constantly outstretch my arms to reach the handlebars. You'll want to tighten the rear disc brake; it works fine, but I wouldn't have minded more stopping power. The caveat? I have not heard great things about Gotrax's customer support.Gotrax GX2 for $1,299: The GX2 is 76 pounds and packs a lot of power and range. This gunmetal scooter looks a bit like something out of Transformers and can hit a max speed of 35 mph via the dual 800-watt motors, but I usually rode it at 20 mph. It took me to Midtown and back to Brooklyn (a total of 18.4 miles) with some juice left over. I hate carrying it up and down the stairs because the stem is super thick, making it difficult to grasp. When you're waiting at a light, the GX2 also switches to Parking mode after a few seconds, so you constantly have to remember to press the mode button to switch it to the driving gear. It's super annoying, and Gotrax says there's no way to disable it. I am a little concerned about the build quality—the motor makes a noise as if something is brushing against it, and this sound disappears if I lightly press the left brake lever while riding. The latch to keep the stem upright comes down too easily, despite a sliding lock mechanism to keep it in place; Gotrax says it might just be that it's installed too tightly. If you see any of these issues, I recommend reaching out to Gotrax and going to a local scooter shop to have them take a look.Evolv Terra for $1,217: I enjoyed my time with the Evolv Terra (7/10, WIRED Recommends). It's 53 pounds and thanks to the thin stem, not too annoying to carry. It's powerful, with the potential to go as fast as 31 miles per hour when you engage both 600-watt motors (check your local speed laws first!). Otherwise, you can cruise along at 20 mph as I did on the second gear speed setting (there are three in total) with the single motor. Range is pretty average, with around two bars left on the meter after 15 miles, so it can potentially last more than 20 miles, especially if you're conservative with its speeds. The suspension is OK, but the solid tires on rougher roads can feel quite bumpy. The fenders also seemed pretty useless to me as, after a wet ride post-rain, my back was covered in specks of dirt kicked up from the rear tire. The stem's angle was also a little too close to my body, and the lack of a thumb throttle meant my wrist hurt after long rides. You can tweak the angle of the throttle and brakes to improve this, though.Radio Flyer S533 for $599: Honestly, I'm surprised at how well this scooter did in my tests. The folding mechanism is just a latch and a sleeve you pull down to keep the latch from coming undone while you ride. It's super easy to fold and unfold, and it's lightweight at 30 pounds. It's not a commuter scooter by any means—my range hovered under 8 miles on a single charge—and despite exceeding its 220-pound load capacity, I averaged around 14 mph of its 16 mph top speed. It's a nice little scooter for going to the post office, grocery store, or Cinnabon when my wife asks for a cinnamon roll. However, its price doesn't match its power and performance; it should be cheaper. It's also worth noting that the first model the company sent me didn't turn on, and the second model had a deflated front tire. Inflating it was a quick affair, and I haven't had problems since.Scooter AccessoriesThe Beam Virgo Helmet
Photograph: Julian ChokkattuThe Beam Virgo Helmet for $299: If you're riding faster than 15 miles per hour, I strongly suggest you get a full-face helmet, which covers more than just the top of your noggin. I've been using The Beam's Virgo for several weeks and am quite satisfied with it. It looks cool as heck, and I love the flip-down visor—it began raining when I was riding once, and it was nice not having water splatter into my eyes. Putting it on is a bit of a squeeze (I have the large-size helmet), and I have to take off my glasses. But I put them back on once the helmet is on my head, and there are holes on the side to put earbuds in. It's very comfy, though the padding sometimes falls out of place, and you have to readjust it when donning the helmet. It's a MIPS helmet, which means it reduces rotational motion to the brain in an accident to reduce the risk of brain damage.Thousand Heritage 2.0 Helmet for $99: Anyone going slower speeds will be perfectly fine with a Thousand helmet. Several WIRED reviewers, including yours truly, have tested and used Thousand's Heritage helmets. They're attractive and comfy, and you can clasp the helmet one-handed.Giro Ethos Mips Helmet for $250: If you don't like the look of the Thousand Heritage (how dare you), I am fond of the Giro Ethos Mips. It's supremely comfy to wear, and there's a remote accessory you can attach to the handlebars to enable turn signals on the helmet itself. (Annoyingly, the helmet recharges via microUSB.)Photograph: Julian ChokkattuPeak Design Universal Bar Mount for $50: To use this mount, you need to use the Peak Design case for your iPhone, Samsung, or Google Pixel, but it is by far my favorite mounting solution. It uses Apple's MagSafe system paired with Peak Design's SlimLink mechanism, which makes the magnetic attachment even more secure. After years of use, I have never had a phone fly off this mount. It's easy to wrap around the handlebars, too, though it may not work on scooters with thick handles.Photograph: Julian ChokkattuBeam Corky Bike Mirror for $35: I've had these side mirrors attached to the handlebars of a few scooters for some time now. They're easy to install, if a bit cheap in quality, but they offer a slightly better riding experience because you don't have to twist your head as much every time you're about to make a turn. You can adjust the angle a fair bit.Kryptonite Keeper 785 Chain Lock for $48: This might be a useless recommendation because it's so hard to find a good bike lock these days that doesn't deter determined thieves. I bought the Keeper 785 in 2019, and it has kept all of my scooters and bikes safe and secure since then, but I am also paranoid and never leave my vehicle out of sight for more than an hour or two. Using this lock does not guarantee safety, but at least Kryptonite offers up to $500 in coverage for registered locks. I prefer a chain lock for scooters because it's just easier to throw it through the right spots to quickly secure it.Avoid These ScootersNiu KQi Air Scooter
Photograph: Julian ChokkattuWe try to test electric scooters for two to three months, oftentimes even longer. Not all of them are winners. That's what you'll find below—escooters that are OK but not as good as our picks above.Niu KQi Air: I was so excited to test this scooter, but my experience with it over several months is mixed. I still like it, but a few quirks hold it back. The KQi Air has a carbon fiber frame, allowing it to be a mere 26 pounds with a 20-mph top speed. That makes it the lightest scooter I have ever tested. It's easy to fold and has turn signals, a slick app, and reliable regenerative braking. The range is a bit lackluster—I usually got just under 10 miles on a single charge, but it's so lightweight that when it died on my way home once, I strapped it to a Citi Bike's front basket and cycled home (don't do this!). The ride quality is great, but I had issues with it refusing to connect to my phone until I disconnected the internal power cable in the stem. There's a theft protection that sounds an alarm and slows down the scooter if someone tries to roll it away, but bizarrely, while you can permanently turn off the alarm, the only way to stop it from auto-braking as you roll it is to turn the scooter on. My initial model stopped working completely and wouldn't turn on, so Niu had to send me a second model. Oh, and sometimes, during rides, the scooter slows down and doesn't hit its top speed until a few minutes later. I suspect there's some thermal issue causing this. Overall, there's a lot of promise, but it's just annoying.Veo Cosmo X: This is not a kick scooter, but a sit-down scooter. I used it for a few months and enjoyed the ride, but the range is terrible—I barely got 10 miles out of this 94-pound behemoth at its top speed of 17 mph. Veo has its roots in the rideshare market, and this is its first entry into the consumer segment, but the specs on this scooter do not match up with the exorbitant price.Gotrax G6 and Eclipse: These scooters have decent range and are comfy to ride. However, both of them have an overheating problem. On an 80-degree-Fahrenheit summer day, the G6 gave me the overheating error after 20 minutes of riding. It especially struggled going up a bridge. I kept having to turn it off, wait a few minutes, and start riding again, but the issue kept repeating. This same problem happened with the Eclipse, too. They're rated to carry up to 265 pounds, so there should not have been any issues.Atomi Alpha: This is one of the most attractive scooters in this guide (5/10, WIRED Review), but it has the worst kickstand of them all. It’s so small and vertically angled that a light wind can knock it over. The scooter offers a pretty comfy ride, with some fun visibility lights, and the whole thing is easy to fold up and carry. It just struggles to hit its top speed despite being under its weight limit. My first unit died after a few months, and my second unit also died after some time.Levy Plus: My fellow WIRED reviewer Adrienne So tested a prototype of the Levy Plus in 2020. She liked its replaceable battery and reliable disc brakes, but found the whole thing “agonizingly slow on hilly terrain.” It goes up to 18 mph and is rated for 5 to 10 percent inclines, so it's best for flat roads. It's one of the lighter escooters out there, at just 30 pounds.Unagi Model One Classic: Unagi lets you rent a refurbished version of its older Classic for $59 per month. I think you should stick with the new Model One Voyager instead. The specs on the Model One Classic are just too outdated.Power up with unlimited access to WIRED.
