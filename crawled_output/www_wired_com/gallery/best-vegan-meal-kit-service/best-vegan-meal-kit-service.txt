HungryrootVegan-specific meal kit services are a modern miracle for vegans, who usually aren't afforded the same conveniences as meat eaters or those without dietary restrictions. We at WIRED love meal kits, because they're all about modern convenience—you can eat what you want, even if you're on a specialty diet or have strong food preferences, without ever leaving your house. Gone are the days of grocery shopping and scouring online for recipes; these contemporary vegan meal kit services do the heavy lifting for you using curated menus and algorithms, with choices for both premade microwavable meals and kits where you do the cooking yourself.Some vegan meal kit services, like Hungryroot, use AI customization to curate menus based on your specific tastes. Others, like Daily Harvest, have a set selection of choices so you can always keep your freezer stocked with vegan, gluten-free meals to have on hand. I'm vegan myself, so I know how difficult it can be to find new recipes that will actually taste good without breaking the bank. Plus, meal kits are a great way to try out new foods and recipes. I was pleasantly surprised to find that there are actually a plethora of meal kit services for vegans; my personal favorite was Purple Carrot, with Thistle being my favorite healthy choice, and Mosaic as the best prepared frozen. Five of the meal kit brands I tested offer only vegan choices, with the rest offering a full range with multiple vegan options.Be sure to check out our investigation into whether Meal Kits Are Cheaper Than Groceries in 2025 and our related guides, like The Best Meal Kit Delivery Services, The Best Food Gifts You Can Buy Online, and The Best Delivery Chocolate Boxes.Table of ContentsAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronCompare Our PicksOthers TestedDo Not RecommendAre Meal Kit Services Worth It?How I TestedWhat I'm Testing NextUpdated September 2025: We've added meal kits from Mosaic, Splendid Spoon, and NutriFit, and updated prices throughout.Best Vegan Meal Kit OverallCourtesy of Purple CarrotPhotograph: Molly HigginsPhotograph: Molly HigginsChevronChevronPurple CarrotMeal KitShop at
Purple CarrotI absolutely love Purple Carrot because it uses inventive plant-based ingredients from various cuisines from around the world, offering premade frozen meals and fresh meal kits, plus expansive vegan groceries. This kit isn't the best for beginners—the meal prep time was often around an hour and required sometimes-involved preparation and active cooking, but I liked the super-varied and always tasty choices.I've tested Purple Carrot's offerings, like a tasty Mediterranean rice salad with roasted vegetables and stuffed grape leaves, and butternut dumplings with hazelnuts and sesame butter, both of which took an hour to make, but were absolutely delicious. But unlike other vegan meal kits, the brand's menu is constantly changing by season. I also tested its summer grill package, which featured the best vegan Chicago dog I've ever had, and its back-to-school offerings, including a super quick and easy vegan pizza-salad combo.I love cooking, so I liked the adventurous, inventive recipes. Although if you’re a picky eater, or don’t want to spend a lot of time in the kitchen, this may not be the service for you.Is the brand completely vegan?Yes.AvailabilityLower 48 states.Plan detailsFresh meal kits, ready-to-eat frozen meals, or Jumpstart Program (preselected meals). Plus, a selection of groceries. Meal kits have two- or four-person plans with three or four meals per week. Purple Carrot auto-populates the next seven weeks of orders based on your preferences, and you can alter the menu from over available meals or items up to a week before shipment. Each meal has an icon next to it, noting things like less prep work, high-protein, low-calorie, gluten- or soy-free. Depending on shipping location, you'll get your weekly delivery on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday.CostAt the time of writing, meal kit plans start at $11 per serving for four servings and $13 for two servings. Ready-to-eat starts at $13, is a single serving, and is six, eight, or 10 meals per week. The Jumpstart Program is a full meal plan with 12 ready-to-eat meals per week for four weeks at $130 per week. Shipping is $10, free if the order is over $100. Purple Carrot often runs 40 percent–off discounts for the first week.WIRED/TIREDAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWIREDAdventurous, tasty recipesHas both meal kits and ready-to-eat premade mealsVaried choices and frequently changing seasonal menusGrocery optionsTIREDRecipes can be involved and time-consumingNot great for beginnersBest Vegan Meal Kit for FamiliesCourtesy of Green ChefPhotograph: Matthew KorfhagePhotograph: Matthew KorfhageChevronChevronGreen ChefMeal KitShop at
Green ChefMy meat-eating colleague Matthew Korfhage was impressed with Green Chef's gluten-free fare (Read his full review here). Green Chef has vegan choices that are more basic and family-friendly. During my week of testing, there were half a dozen vegan choices from that week's menu. It seems that there are usually five vegan choices per week. For vegetarians, there are several more—most meal kits tend to rely heavily on butter. You'll first choose a vegan plan and preferred meals, and the weekly meal plans will match your criteria and preferences.The meal kits I had relied heavily on simple, Asian-inspired stir-fries with tofu, veggies, and rice, including these solid sriracha-tamari tofu bowls. The standout was a risotto with squash and vegan pesto and Parmesan—I'd be impressed to have a vegan dish as delicious in a restaurant. It took over an hour to make, but it may have been one of the best vegan dupe meals I've ever had.Is the brand completely vegan?No, you'll have to look for the “vegan” tag on the menu choices. There are usually around five vegan options per weekly menu.AvailabilityLower 48 states (minus some parts of Louisiana).Plan detailsServings for two, four, or six people, at either three or four meals per week. Delivery is once a week, and you can choose which day it's delivered (settings can be changed five days in advance).CostAt the time of writing, meals are $12 (and unlike others, cost doesn't change depending on quantity), and shipping is $11.

ThistleThistle is the best healthy, (mostly) single-serving premade meal kit I've tested (Read my full review here). With the most laborious meals requiring just a flash in a hot pan to enhance flavor, these refrigerated meals are mostly a mix of gluten-free, fruit-focused breakfasts; inventive, fresh salads; and preprepared bean- and pasta-forward veggie dinners.The Mexican-inspired corn and poblano pepper salad was solid and hearty; the lemongrass shirataki bowl—a cold noodle salad dish—hit all the right elements of savory-spice and varied texture. Thistle’s vegan take on cheesecake with tres leches-esque coconut vanilla mousse and tahini caramel was perhaps the best vegan dessert I’ve ever had. Without a discount, this plan is a bit above my price point, but it remains one of my favorite vegan meal kit services I've tested.Is the brand completely vegan?Yes (Plus an optional add-on for sustainable meats for certain dinners and lunches at an additional $3 per meal).AvailabilityEast and West Coast cities and Chicago (you can enter your zip code to see if your area is covered).Plan detailsThistle has a new, curated preset menu each week of single servings, consisting of three meals, a snack, and a dessert for six days of the week, but you can make edits based on your preferences. Delivery is one or two times per week, depending on your plan.CostAt the time of writing, breakfasts start at $13, lunches and dinners at $17, and snacks at $8.

HungryrootWIRED reviewer Matthew Korfhage liked Hungryroot's AI tool that micro-customizes menus for dietary restrictions or preferences (Read his full review here), which also makes this a great meal kit for vegans. It wasn't as adventurous or had the plant-centric freshness of others I've tested, but Hungryroot would be great for those with kids who need more tame options, or for people who want familiar choices, like those easing into a plant-based diet. However, with its AI-assisted customization options, you can easily curate it to your tastes.Nearly all the meals I prepared were solid but one-note, needing an extra element to add complexity—acid from a squeeze of lemon, or red chili flakes for heat improved many of these dishes. Throughout my week of testing, meal kits required little prep and only took about half an hour or less to make. They were varied but basic, with a lemongrass tofu and broccoli stir-fry, cauliflower tacos, and American fare like a veggie burger with sweet potato fries.Is the brand completely vegan?No, you'll need to use filters and look for icons to find vegan choices, and AI curates future meals based on preferences.AvailabilityLower 48 states.Plan detailsDelivers every day of the week, and you can make changes or skip until Monday or Thursday at 7 pm before your next delivery. The smallest plan is two or three two-serving dinners; after, plans vary depending on how many additional meals, snacks, or sweets you choose per week.Cost$8 to $13 per serving. Shipping free for orders above $70, otherwise it's $7. The number of meals you choose turns into “points,” where the sum is different for every dish. Any remaining points can be used the next week. There are heavy discounts for first-time users, like 30 percent off your first week and a free food item.WIRED/TIREDAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWIREDAI-powered menu curationMany choices of familiar flavors and foodsGood for people on specialized dietsAlso offers grocery optionsTIREDDifficult to view meal options before committingFlavors could be one-noteBest Frozen Vegan MealsPhotograph: Molly HigginsPhotograph: Molly HigginsChevronChevronMosaic FoodsFrozen MealsShop at
Mosaic FoodsLike its sister brand Splendid Spoon, Mosaic has plans that start at six, 12, or 18 items per week, and unless you choose the family plan, all meals are single-serving, starting at $10. You can have the company send you an assortment, or you can customize choices yourself. For testing, I got about a dozen of Mosaic's most popular vegan veggie bowl meals ($12). Each one was ready to eat, taking five minutes or less to reheat in the microwave. The meals were high in protein with 13 to 30 grams each, averaged about 400 to 500 calories per meal, and had about 30 percent of the fat and sodium needed in a day.Since reheated food can get mushy quickly, Mosaic smartly adds shreds of cabbage, crunchy nuts, and hearty greens for more diversity in texture. A vegan Indian "butter" tofu with pops of raisins and dates, a decadent vegan carbonara, and a tangy Thai stir fry were standouts. Although the meals were sometimes high in sodium and fat, I often found myself needing to add more salt, pepper, hot or soy sauce, especially to the tofu-centric dishes.Is the brand completely vegan?No, also vegetarian options.AvailabilityEast Coast, West Coast, and some of middle America, check availability here.Plan detailsPlans start at 6, 12 and 18 items per week, with delivery cycles weekly, or every 2, 3, or 4 weeks.CostFamily plans start at $6 per serving, single-serve start at $10 per serving (most of the frozen meals I tested were $12).

Splendid SpoonThis plan has vegan, gluten-free frozen meals, smoothies, and juices. Plans start at six, 12, or 18 items per week, and you can customize further with different items. Once you pick the plan, you can choose any item in Splendid Spoon's catalog of 50 premade smoothies, soups, noodles, dishes, and juice shots, or you can have the company send you an assortment of items. I tested Splendid Spoon's 5-Day Detox Program, which has 30 items and requires no subscription. Daily, you'll eat a warm breakfast like a soup, and for the rest of the day you'll have four soups, dishes, or smoothies, plus a superfood shot.The detox plan is “designed to reduce inflammation, reinforce clean eating habits, and support a healthier gut microbiome.” You're supposed to follow a 16:8 intermittent fast during the day, and the plan comes with a scheduled guide of what to eat. Let's just say I was, um, clearing out the shop, having only fibrous, gingery juices and bean- and kale-centric soups five times daily. It definitely affected my gut biome, but I found it difficult to stick to the plan and eat so much during the day—that's a whole lotta liquid food.But as far as frozen meals go, this was one of the tastiest I've tested. Splendid Spoon does it right texture-wise, focusing on spicy, aromatic, bean soups and chilis like cauliflower tikka soup and tomato quinoa chili. If you don't go with the detox plan, I think trying out Splendid Spoon is worth it, if not to just have some flavor-packed, reheatable hearty frozen soups on hand for winter or lazy nights.Is the brand completely vegan?Yes (also gluten-free).AvailabilityLower 48 states.Plan detailsPlans start at 6, 12 and 18 items per week.

Daily HarvestDaily Harvest is a gluten- and dairy-free, plant-based, premade frozen meal delivery service. (Read my full review here.) The meals consist of smoothie blends and oatmeal for breakfasts, plus soups, harvest bowls, grains, and pastas for the rest. The meals are mostly low-calorie and high-protein, and just require heating in a microwave or on the stove, with some things like soups and smoothies requiring a blender or food processor.Unlike most plans I've tested, which change weekly and have a curated menu, Daily Harvest lets you choose your meals à la carte, and its whole selection is available online (including prices). A restaurant-quality chickpea and coconut curry harvest bowl was a standout; a black bean and vegan cheeze bowl was bland, one-note mush. Oftentimes the flavors were a bit dull for me, and I grew tired of the mushy consistency. However, if you’re a solo vegan who wants to do minimal cooking, or just use the frozen grains as bases for a more lively meal, this is a solid option.Is the brand completely vegan?Yes (and gluten-free).AvailabilityLower 48 states.Plan detailsIt's à la carte and you can choose whatever you want, you just need to meet the $50 minimum amount to order. The menu changes out items periodically but doesn't offer a curated, rotating menu like many others I tested. Daily Harvest also has dietitian-curated bundles, like a Mediterranean Diet–inspired collection, a protein smoothie bundle, meals that support GLP-1 diets, and meals that align with the Whole30 diet.CostAt the time of writing, servings start at $8 for breakfast bowls and go up to $11 for most everything else, like harvest bowls and pasta. (Everything is a single serving).

SunbasketBesides Purple Carrot, Sunbasket was my favorite of the vegan meal kits I tested, I just wish they had more vegan options weekly. Sunbasket has both premade, heat-’n’-eat meals and meal kits that you need to prepare, along with marketplace items you could buy from the grocery store, like fish and bread. Most weeks there are only two to three vegan dinner options, so this isn't going to be a meal plan that vegans can eat all week, but it's a super tasty and quick way to supplement meals. (If Sunbasket had more vegan choices, I'd be subscribing.)During testing, everything I had was delicious and took about half an hour to prepare. (Unlike the meal kit norm, meals that promised to take 20 minutes stayed within that range.) A fresh black bean and quinoa Buddha bowl was topped with seared veg for a warm umami flavor and fresh avocado for creaminess; I still dream of the cold udon noodle salad with gingered tofu and pickled vegetables; and a quick pre-prepped chop suey was a solid stir-fry.Is the brand completely vegan?No. You'll need to use the vegan filter for dinners, and look for the vegan tag on all other meals and food items.AvailabilityShips to most zip codes in the US, except Alaska, Hawaii, Montana, North Dakota, and parts of New Mexico (and not all delivery days are available in all areas).Plan detailsServings are two to four, or one if it's a premade meal, with three, four, or five meals per week. Depending on your zip code, most can choose delivery any day Sunday through Thursday, but delivery is only once a week.CostMeals start at $10 per serving and go up to $30 for the premium “Chef’s Table” meals, with the majority of vegan meals hovering at about $12 to $15. You'll get free delivery on your first order (after that, delivery is $10). Unlike a lot of meal delivery services, Sunbasket's prices don’t change depending on servings, and there's a $45 order minimum. Sunbasket offers heavy discounts, like $90 off spread across your first four orders. You'll need to make changes or cancel at least a week before the next billing period.WIRED/TIREDAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWIREDShort prep timesMeals that appeal to most peopleGrocery optionsMostly paper, without tons of plastic packagingTIREDLimited options for vegans weeklyProduce arrived on the decline and was not always organicCompare Our PicksWIREDTIREDCompletely vegan?AvailabilityPlan detailsCostPurple CarrotAdventurous, tasty recipes; has both meal kits and ready-to-eat premade meals; varied choices and frequently changing seasonal menus; grocery optionsRecipes can be involved and time-consuming; not great for beginnersYesLower 48 statesFresh meal kits, ready-to-eat frozen meals, or Jumpstart Program, and groceries.

Nearly all meals in Sakara's lineup are uncooked and preprepared—items like veggie burgers are without buns, lasagnas are “deconstructed.” For example, a “Lavender Quesadilla” has broccoli pesto and cashew “cheese” with hibiscus salsa … you get the idea. The menu is curated each week, and meals come in single servings. Sakara also has health supplements (which can be scientifically dubious), like a metabolism booster and fulvic acid cell reset. Sakara's signature nutrition program meal plan is designed to replace all meals and is delivered twice weekly. If you buy one week of five days, three meals a day, it's $465 per week; weekly subscriptions of five days, three meals a day, is $395 per week; prices go down to $141 per week with a 12-week subscription for three days at two meals per day. There's also a "Level II: Detox" program, starting at $465 per week. This meal kit seems fit for Gwyneth Paltrow or WAGs (wife or girlfriend of professional athletes) everywhere, but it wasn't the right fit for my budget and taste preferences.NutriFit for $10 to $45 per meal: NutriFit is more like a personal chef than a meal kit delivery service, specializing in nutrient-dense, fully prepared meals with a huge range of fare, with gluten- and dairy-free and vegetarian and vegan options. The company ships to the lower 48 states, and most meals hovered around $20. NutriFit has customized, chef-curated meal plans that are tailored for the eater and include specifics like health goals and dietary restrictions, where the customer can select their own meals on the Premium plan or have the curated meals from the 13-week rotating menu, starting at $19 per day. There are also à la carte options, which I tested, which range from $10 to $45 per meal. These don't require a subscription or a minimum, and come in meals that serve three to four people or in individual size Fit for ONE meals that feed one, where you choose from “Always Available Favorites” and rotating new specials. A lentil chickpea salad, cold udon noodles, hearty roasted tomato soup, and crispy vegan tacos were standouts. I wasn't a huge fan of most of the chef-curated specials, and the food started to wilt or get mushy if not eaten within the first few days. The user interface of the service isn't the best or easiest to navigate, either.Not RecommendedEat Clean for $9 to $13 per meal: This vegan meal delivery service would be best for someone who loves the taste and convenience of TV dinners. Eat Clean has a dozen plant-based heat-’n’-eat meals available, with availability to order six to 20 meals per week, ranging from six meals for $13 each to 20 meals at $9 each. Each meal comes in a plastic container and needs to be microwaved or heated for around three minutes. Many of the meals have very similar flavors—the tomato sauce base for the chili, spaghetti, and lasagna all tasted the same. The meals with sides often felt random: zucchini with mac and cheese and nuggets; a cornbread on the side of chili that tasted exactly like a cinnamon coffee cake (the flavors didn't go well together on that one). Like TV dinners, flavors were often one-note, and I opted to air fry or oven-bake things to enhance mushy textures. This meal kit is nearly the same price as most I've tested, and the picks above are a whole lot tastier.Are Meal Kit Services Worth It?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronThe answer really depends on what you value, whether that's time, convenience, cost, or something else altogether, like finding new recipes or eating healthier. For me as a vegan, I find it a bit harder to find new recipes or where I can find the ingredients needed when I do find them. Cheaper meal kit service plans hover around $13 per serving, with more expensive plans like Sakara at $400 for a full week of meals. For the cheaper meal plans like Green Chef at $12 with generous portions, the meal prices seem comparable to the cost of buying vegan (often organic) groceries. WIRED reviewer Matthew Korfhage did a deep dive to find out: Are Meal Kits Cheaper Than Groceries in 2025? and the results surprised me.How I TestedAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronI ate and prepared at least three days' worth of meals or four meals minimum from each brand over the course of a week. If the brand had both frozen, microwavable meals and meal kits that needed to be prepared, I tested both. When I could, I let the brand curate the meals for me, going with what the algorithm chose rather than personal taste to get an unbiased look at the choices offered.For meal kits, I prepared them as indicated in the directions and didn't add any extra food items or seasoning, so I could taste them exactly as they were meant to be.What I'm Testing NextAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronI'm testing Purple Carrot's Plantsgiving Box (a vegan Thanksgiving-style dinner special for the holiday).Power up with unlimited access to WIRED.
