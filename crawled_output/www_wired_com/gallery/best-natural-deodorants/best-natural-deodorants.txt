In 2020, I fell for disinformation. I heard somewhere that the aluminum in my deodorant was going to give me all sorts of ailments. And it seemed credible enough that I made the switch from my trusty antiperspirant to “natural” deodorant—which is still my tried-and-true pick, Native Deodorant ($13). Turns out, aluminum in antiperspirant isn’t really harmful. And it’s important to note that “natural” is a term that’s not regulated or defined by the Food and Drug Administration. Marketing language using the terms “natural” or “nontoxic” doesn’t necessarily mean that a product is healthy, or better or worse than another product.For purposes of this guide, “natural” means “aluminum-free.” Aluminum-free deodorant prevents odor. It doesn’t prevent you from sweating the way antiperspirant does, but it usually has some sort of agent to absorb some sweat. Antiperspirants with aluminum actively prevent you from sweating in the first place, and they’ve got fragrance to help mask any odor that escapes.I like using natural deodorant much more than traditional antiperspirants. I feel better when I sweat, I like that the ingredients don’t harsh out my sometimes-sensitive skin, and I like that I can pronounce (and usually identify) the ingredients. I promise I smell good! (I actually think I smell better than I did when I used antiperspirant, for what that’s worth.) As explained further below, aluminum is safe for most people to use. Ultimately, it comes down to whether you want to sweat a little or prevent it entirely. Both types of deodorant work to keep you smelling good and feeling fresh—they just do it in different ways.Be sure to check out our other buying guides, including the Best Greens Powders, Best Beauty Subscription Boxes, Best Protein Powders, and Best Heat Protectant Sprays.Updated September 2025: We’ve added new deodorants from Jukebox and Megababe.

It’s affordable, it’s sold at most drugstores, and it works well. The brand has lots of fun scents, like the Jarritos Watermelon (which I absolutely love because I go to the gym smelling like a watermelon hard candy). But the mainstay scents are nice too, like the Citrus & Herbal Musk (my go-to, with notes of mandarin, chamomile, and cashmere woods) or Cucumber & Mint (with notes of cucumber, apple, and spearmint).Native's formula is vegan and lasts for 24 hours. It can show up on black clothes, but I don’t notice it on other colors. One thing I do notice is that the formula can get gummy if reapplied throughout the day (such as while I’m sweating buckets at a festival and I want to make sure I’m not the stinky girl in the crowd). With some other brands, I can reapply the formula indefinitely. With Native, I need to shower or wipe down my underarms if I’m reapplying more than once to avoid gunk piling up under my arms. It’s not a mark against the deodorant, but it is a factor worth considering.Available Scents30Free FromAluminum, parabens, phthalates (sensitive formulas are free from baking soda as well)Scent StrengthStrong to mediumSweat LevelLow to mediumClothing Stains?SomeFunctional IngredientsTapioca starch and baking soda (for absorption).

Fulton & Roark has you covered. The deodorants are great. They’re refillable (refills cost $25, or get slightly cheaper if you subscribe), and the cases have a twist-on cap that stays closed. The deodorants go on smoothly, and the formula is free of aluminum, baking soda, and phthalates. The formula contains witch hazel (an astringent) and tapioca starch (for absorption). What really shines with this deodorant, though, are the scents, which smell like fine fragrances. There are fragrance notes as well as inspiration notes on each product page.I’m partial to Calle Ocho, a unisex fragrance that has notes of rum, tobacco, and sandalwood and is inspired by Little Havana in Miami. There are 15 scents to choose from. Fulton & Roark also makes complementing perfumes, solid fragrances, body and hair oils, and bar soaps, so you can double up or layer your scents. I get compliments every single time I wear Fulton & Roark, even if I’m only wearing the deodorant. I don’t sweat, there’s no irritation, and I don’t feel the need to reapply it throughout the day. I just smell good from morning to night.Available Scents15Free FromAluminum, baking soda, phthalates, parabensScent StrengthStrongSweat LevelLowClothing Stains?NoneFunctional IngredientsTapioca starch (for absorption).

I like it nearly as much as I like Native, and unlike Native, it doesn't use baking soda, which can cause irritation in some people. Jukebox is easy to apply and has a soothing consistency that doesn't irritate my underarms. Some of the scents are quite unique, such as Coconut Dreamin', which smells like spiced coconut with a bit of tea and citrus. My favorite is Watermelon Disco, which smells like a kicked-up, sweeter, grassier version of the fruit. (There are also less sweet scents with notes like eucalyptus and spearmint.) I really like the deodorant's packaging and its vinyl record theme.Jukebox lasts all day long if I'm just hanging out at home, but in particularly sweaty or stressful situations, I need to reapply it. This was also the case when editor Kat Merck tested it out. (I noticed that my sweat wasn't as stinky as normal when it did break through, possibly because of the included postbiotics.) My only real complaint is that it can leave behind some clothing stains. The good thing is that those stains fade quickly, even on black fabric. The slightly gray deodorant stick means the stains aren't extremely noticeable, and they can usually be wiped away with minimal residue left behind. If you like the idea of Native but want to try different scents than Native offers, I think Jukebox is a very close second.Available Scents11Free FromAluminum, parabens, phthalates, baking sodaScent StrengthStrong to lightSweat LevelMedium to highClothing Stains?FewFunctional IngredientsArrowroot and charcoal powder (for absorption).Formula DetailsStick (contains beeswax)WIRED/TIREDAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWIREDSmells greatEasy to applyTIREDNeeds reapplication during heavy sweatingStains more than I'd likeNatural Deodorant With the Simplest IngredientsPhotograph: Louryn StrampeCrystalMineral Deodorant Stick$7 AmazonThe Crystal Mineral Deodorant Stick has been around for seemingly forever. It contains just one ingredient: potassium alum. That’s a mineral salt that creates a completely invisible and unscented barrier over your skin. To apply, you moisten the top of the stick and swipe it all over your armpits. When I say all over, I mean all over. If you miss a spot, your body odor will escape. The product does work as intended if you apply it properly, and I could see it being ideal for someone with very sensitive skin. I don’t reach for it often, because I prefer my deodorants to have some scent. I’d rather smell like fragrance than like nothing. (For what it’s worth, I’m currently testing two scented products from the same brand.)I successfully worked out a few times with this deodorant as my only method of odor protection, and I didn’t smell bad even after sweating. One thing to note is that the crystal shrinks over time, and it’s a little fragile. So be careful and don’t drop it, and be prepared to remove the crystal and apply it by hand rather than with the applicator once you’ve used it for a few months.Available ScentsN/AFree FromAluminum, parabens, phthalates, baking sodaScent StrengthNone (it’s unscented)Sweat LevelLow (with proper application)Clothing Stains?NoneFunctional IngredientsPotassium alum, a mineral salt that creates a barrier on your skin that prevents odor-causing bacteria from multiplying.

And while the Wood Barrel Bourbon and Fresh Falls scents definitely skew masculine, the Coconut Castaway scent I also tried is more unisex. These deodorants are the biggest of the bunch—presumably because men have larger underarms than women? In any case, that large size makes it easy to apply over a wide area. And they all smell great. The formula has charcoal and arrowroot powder in it, which both help to absorb sweat and odor. There are also postbiotics that help your underarm bacteria stay balanced. I did notice more sweat when I worked out, and the scents faded a bit faster than some other deodorants I’ve tried. But overall they worked well and held up through my PR on the leg press.If you’re looking for a natural deodorant that smells like typical manly men (think Old Spice or aftershave), the scent selection here is worth checking out. Dudes can go aluminum-free too. One thing to note is that the formula does contain beeswax, so it might not be suitable for vegans.Available Scents11Free FromAluminum, parabens, pthalates, baking sodaScent StrengthMediumSweat LevelMedium to highClothing Stains?SomeFunctional IngredientsCharcoal and arrowroot powder (for absorption)Formula DetailsStick (contains beeswax)WIRED/TIREDAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWIREDLarge size“Masculine” scents availableTIREDApplicator gets messyThe Best Natural Deodorant PackagingPhotograph: Louryn StrampeWildNatural Deodorant$20 Amazon$16 WildWild Natural Deodorant comes first as a starter pack. You choose your case—there are many cute options—and choose your scent. Once you’re finished with your deodorant, you can refill the case using plastic-free bamboo-pulp-wrapped refills. Wild’s website has a larger selection of cases and scents to choose from. The cases are made from aluminum and recycled plastic, and I’ve found them to be pretty sturdy during my testing time. I tried two limited-edition Wild scents that are no longer available for purchase except in mini sizes. One of them (Sugar Plum Fairy) worked really well with my body chemistry, and I felt fresh as a daisy all day long. The other (Enchanted Forest) absolutely did not and left me smelling funky at the gym. Wild offers lots of limited-edition seasonal scents online, but they’re tricky—and occasionally impossible—to find in stores. The company does offer a satisfaction guarantee if you are a new customer, you order from its website, and you contact the customer service team within 30 days.You could also check out a pack of mini sizes to see which scents you like best before committing to a full-size stick. In any case, the scent that worked well was pleasant, and the deodorant lasted for 24 hours. And I like that it doesn’t have excess plastic waste, which can absolutely not be said for most deodorants on the market. Once my current refill runs out I will definitely be purchasing another. My colleague Adrienne So has also tried and liked this brand.Available Scents13 (varies)Free FromAluminum, pthalates, parabens (some formulas are baking-soda-free)Scent StrengthFaint to mediumSweat LevelMediumClothing Stains?SomeFunctional IngredientsTapioca starch and baking soda (for absorption).

I wore it for a full day to test its claim of 24-hour protection, and it worked! To my surprise. Usually I find myself wanting to reapply between the 12- and 16-hour mark, but this deodorant lasted all day. The light scent faded somewhere around hour 16, but when I woke up, I didn’t start to smell myself until hour 23. It applies smoothly and gently, though the baking-soda-free formula can be a little messy and is prone to some light staining, so be careful with your clothing.I tested the Santal Blossom scent, which smells fresh, green, and citrusy. I’d say it’s pretty unisex, and the scent isn’t very strong, even when first applied. But Billie’s website has more scents to choose from, including those that lean more feminine. If you want deodorant that lasts literally all day long, this is a safe bet.Available Scents5Free FromAluminum, pthalates, parabens, baking sodaScent StrengthFaint to mediumSweat LevelMediumClothing Stains?SomeFunctional IngredientsTapioca starch (for absorption)Formula DetailsVegan stickWIRED/TIREDAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWIREDLasts a full 24 hoursTIREDFormula is on the messy sideA Natural Deodorant With MagnesiumPhotograph: Louryn StrampeCrystalSolid Deodorant Stick$8 AmazonCrystal’s stick deodorant is unique in that it uses magnesium hydroxide to neutralize the bacteria that causes body odor. I tested the Coconut and Vanilla scent, which has hints of essential oils like peppermint and chamomile. It smells downright edible, but not so foodlike that I don’t want it near my armpits. It goes on smoothly and doesn’t leave a single white mark on my clothing.I do wish the scent were a bit stronger, but I find that it lasts throughout the day. When I wore this through a workout, I didn’t smell bad, but I also didn’t smell like a strong fragrance. I just smelled like me, but without body odor. I also like the screw-on lid and the way the formula leaves my armpits feeling moisturized rather than dry. If you’re looking for a natural deodorant that smells natural, this is an option worth considering.Available Scents6Free FromAluminum, pthalates, parabens, baking sodaScent StrengthFaintSweat LevelMediumClothing Stains?NoneFunctional IngredientsMagnesium hydroxide (for bacteria neutralization), tapioca starch (for absorption)Formula DetailsVegan stickWIRED/TIREDAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWIREDSmells so good!Screw-on applicator capMoisturizing formulaTIREDScent may be too subtle for some folksStrongest-Smelling Natural DeodorantPhotograph: Louryn StrampeSalt & StoneDeodorant$20 Amazon$20 Sephora$20 Salt & StoneI tried Salt & Stone deodorant in the Extra Strength Black Rose & Oud scent, and at first I wasn't sure whether I liked it. The scent is very strong compared to others I've tried. But it grew on me as I wore it, and I was still smelling it after 32 hours (though I never managed to make it quite last 48 hours like the packaging advertises). The formula is soft and gel-like, so it glides on smoothly. The Black Rose & Oud scent smells exactly like roses and oud. It's very much what you'd expect. But if those notes aren't your favorite, there are four other scents (or two if you'd prefer the baking-soda-free Sensitive Skin formula). Overall, if strong smells are what you seek, and you want something less complex than the perfume-like Fulton & Roark deodorants mentioned in this guide, you should try this brand.Available Scents5Free FromAluminum, pthalates, parabens (sensitive skin formulas are baking-soda free)Scent StrengthStrongSweat LevelLow to mediumClothing Stains?FewFunctional IngredientsTapioca starch and baking soda (for absorption)Formula DetailsVegan stickWIRED/TIREDAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWIREDStrong-smellingSmooth formulaTIREDMight be too strong-smelling for someBest Gender-Neutral Natural DeodorantPhotograph: Louryn StrampePhotograph: Louryn StrampeChevronChevronMegababeDaily Deodorant$14 $11 (21% off) Amazon (Sunny Pits)$14 $11 (21% off) Amazon (Beachy Pits)$14 MegababeA lot of deodorant scents are overtly cologne-like or perfume-like. The lemony scent of Megababe's Sunny Pits deodorant is neither. It smells fresh and bright, like you rubbed oranges and lemons on your underarms. The formula also felt gentle and easy to glide on, even on freshly shaved skin. I also didn't have a single bit of white residue on my shirts while testing this product. I did have to reapply it during particularly heavy workouts, but I think if you're looking for a fresh, neutral scent, this is worth a shot.I've also tried Megababe Beachy Pits, which smells a bit like a floral sunscreen with underlying hints of coconut. It's still gender-neutral and fresh, and it has the same formula and efficacy as Sunny Pits.Available Scents4Free FromAluminum, pthalates, parabens, baking sodaScent StrengthMediumSweat LevelLowClothing Stains?NoneFunctional IngredientsCornstarch and willow bark extract (for absorption)Formula DetailsVegan stickWIRED/TIREDAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWIREDFresh, gender-neutral scentsNo stainingScrew-on capTIREDReapplication needed during heavy sweatingCompare Our Top 10 Natural DeodorantsDeodorantProsConsAvailable ScentsFree FromScent StrengthSweat LevelClothing Stains?Functional IngredientsFormula DetailsNative DeodorantAffordable, available, and wide variety of scents.Some stains.

It’s more fresh than sweet, and I’d say it’s unisex-leaning-feminine. It goes on clear and smooth, and it didn’t stain my clothes at all. However, it didn’t last me through a workout without reapplying, unlike some other brands I tried. I think it’s fine, but I wouldn’t call it a “performance deodorant.” If you’re looking for a clear formula and you don’t mind reapplying, it might be worth a shot.Fur Ingrown Deodorant for $19: My relationship with this deodorant is as complicated as my relationship with my underarm hair. Sometimes I don’t shave it for months; sometimes I shave it every other day. This deodorant contains ingredients like willow bark (to prevent ingrown hairs) and niacinamide (to brighten underarms). It did both of those things very well. But it didn’t do a great job at preventing odor throughout the day, and the smell is very green and earthy, which didn’t agree with my body chemistry. It might really appeal to some people though—online reviewers seem to love it or hate it—so I recommend smelling it in a store before purchasing.Curie Clean Deodorant (two-pack) for $28: This formula smells good when first applied, but quickly fades away after an hour or two. It also stained my clothes more than some others I tried. During my second use, it caused some irritation, so I discontinued it. I didn’t notice myself sweating more or less compared to other kinds of natural deodorant. However, the brand does have a great Detox Mask that can help with the transitional period when switching to natural deodorant. It’ll be featured more prominently in an upcoming guide.Dove Aluminum-Free Deodorant for $11: Dove’s deodorant is mostly fine, and I like how affordable it is. But the texture is really smooth and leaves my underarms feeling strangely sticky, even after letting them dry. The fragrances aren’t powerful or long-lasting enough for my own personal preference. They also all have a powdery undertone that I was not a fan of. I did notice some BO partway through the day during my testing. Since this is so subjective, your mileage may vary. The packaging also came taped shut, and the tape left behind sticky residue on the outside of my deodorant that was impossible to remove without rubbing alcohol.Lume Whole Body Deodorant (three-pack) for $40: This pricey deodorant smelled terrible to me. I received the Invisible Cream formula in Minted Cucumber, which smelled like pool chlorine and hand soap. I refused to put it on my body. I also received the Clean Tangerine Smooth Solid formula, which initially smelled marginally better but still had a weird hand-soap element to it. It left white marks all over my clothes and oddly smelled like cheese once applied. I washed it off and called my testing done. Reader, I love you, but I’m not going to smell like cheese all day just to see if the smell magically transforms after a few hours. Senior commerce editor Kat Merck also tried the Lavender Sage Invisible Cream, and she said it reminded her of laundry that was left overnight in the washing machine—and that the deodorant made her smell worse than she would have had she not worn any in the first place. Lume does have many fans across the internet, so again, this may be something that can be boiled down to personal preference. I suggest smelling it in a store before purchasing.Bite Refillable Deodorant for $44: I like the minimalist aesthetic of this refillable deodorant. The sleek metal case is almost miniature, and the entire setup is completely plastic-free. However, it’s easy to push the deodorant stick up too high, which can be messy if the temperatures are warm. In fact, I found the formula too soft in general, and it tended to get gunky and gummy throughout the day, both on my armpits and on the case. I also didn’t love the neroli scent. I think this could work well if you want the most minimalist, nondescript natural deodorant possible, but there are other refillable options that smell better and last longer.Photograph: Louryn StrampeSaltair AHA Deodorant for $12: I was initially really impressed by the scent I tried from Saltair. Pink Beach smells like a summer sunset on the ocean. Unfortunately, despite my best efforts to make it work, I couldn’t apply this formula without my armpits feeling sticky and irritated. I used it on clean, dry, hairless skin, and I let my armpits dry fully before lowering my arms. But I had this constant feeling of tacky, sweaty irritation that eventually led to a rash, so I discontinued testing.How Does WIRED Test Natural Deodorants?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronI‘ve been wearing natural deodorant since 2020. I wore each of these deodorants at least seven times—including at least once during a calm day at home and at least once during a workout at the gym. I also tested whether they stain by putting on a black T-shirt after application. I test each on freshly showered and shaved skin, and by reapplying it at least once on a day that I haven't showered. Next I'll be testing liquid AHA deodorants and aluminum-free deodorant from Schmidt's.What Ingredients Make Natural Deodorant Work?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronHere’s an explanation about some of the ingredients you may see in your research.Aluminum: Natural deodorants (usually) mask odor and don’t emphasize sweat reduction. Antiperspirants (usually) mask odor and prevent sweat. The sweat prevention comes from aluminum salts, which block sweat ducts under your arms. There were a few studies that talked about elevated breast cancer or Alzheimer’s disease risks from using aluminum, but there’s no definite link between them (according to the FDA, the American Cancer Society, and the National Cancer Institute, among others). It’s probably fine to use antiperspirants with aluminum in them. Some people with kidney disease are advised to avoid aluminum, and others want to “play it safe” and avoid aluminum. As for me, I sort of feel better when I sweat? In any case, that’s the lowdown on aluminum. TL;DR: The science says it’s fine for most people.Parabens: Parabens are preservatives that have been shown to mimic estrogen in the body, but at much lower rates than the body’s natural estrogen. Parabens are somewhat common ingredients in food, medicine, and beauty products, though they’re less common as more people try to avoid them. Some parabens are banned in the EU until more research can be done. The FDA has concluded that parabens are safe. It’s relatively easy to avoid parabens if you choose to. Most antiperspirants don’t contain parabens; most natural deodorants don’t, either.Phthalates: Phthalates make plastic more flexible and durable, and they can also be used in some beauty products as stabilizers. Some studies have concluded that they’re safe; others suggest links between phthalates and skin irritation, cancer, or early death. But those links were not causal. Phthalates do have a California Proposition 65 warning. The recommended deodorants in this guide are phthalate-free. Many antiperspirants do contain phthalates, but not all of them.Baking soda: Some natural deodorants use baking soda as an absorptive agent to prevent sweat and as an antibacterial agent to prevent odor. Some people can develop a rash from using baking-soda-based formulas, due to the reaction between the baking soda and their body’s natural pH balance. It’s hard to tell whether or not you’re sensitive to baking soda until you try it, but if you typically have sensitive skin, you may want to try a formula without baking soda. (We recommend some in this buying guide.)What Is the “Transition Period”?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWhen you make the switch from antiperspirant to natural deodorant, you might go through a transition period lasting from one to four weeks. Long story short, after years of not sweating while using antiperspirants, you might find yourself sweating a whole lot more as your body adjusts when switching to natural deodorant. It’ll level out eventually, but for me personally, I smelled like a gym full of teenage boys for two weeks. Some people don’t have a transition phase at all. I also developed a heat rash from sweating so much during the middle of summer—my skin was irritated, which meant I couldn’t use deodorant at all, therefore raising the Stink Factor. Now, though, I sweat less than I ever did while using antiperspirants.Be prepared to stick it out. I have an issue with the term “detox,” because our bodies already have a detoxifying process (called the kidneys). However, a clay mask like the Curie Detox Mask can be helpful in drawing out excess moisture and calming down irritated skin that you might experience during the transition period. Otherwise, just keep your underarms dry and be gentle on your skin. It won’t last forever.What the Tables In This Guide MeanAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronIt’s hard to empirically test deodorant. Scent preferences vary from person to person, and they can change based on your body chemistry. Some people might prefer a different formula, some people shave and some don’t, and some people care more about sweat absorption than scent. Do you shower every single day? Do you work out frequently? Do you naturally sweat a lot or a little? All of these things can factor in to whether or not you’ll like a deodorant. Here’s what the tables in this guide mean.Available scents: How many scents you can choose from as of press time.Free from: These ingredients are not in the deodorant.Scent strength: “Strong” lasts all day. “Medium” fades halfway through the day. “Faint” means it faded fast or was barely noticeable in the first place.Sweat level: “Low” means I didn’t notice any sweat. “Medium” means I noticed some wetness but didn’t feel the need to reapply the deodorant. “High” means I sweat a lot and felt the need to reapply throughout the day.Clothing stains: “None” means it didn’t stain my clothes. “Few” means it might show up on a black T-shirt. “High” means it will absolutely show up on your clothes, regardless of color.Functional ingredients: A list of the main ingredients that help absorb sweat and prevent odor.Formula details: Is it vegan? Is it a stick, cream, or roll-on? I’ll let you know here.Power up with unlimited access to WIRED. Get best-in-class reporting and exclusive subscriber content that's too important to ignore.
