A hooded sweatshirt can be a statement piece, but you’re also probably wearing one over your pajamas, while working out at the gym, or pulled over your head on a long flight. There are so many different fabrics, cuts, price points, and styles that you can never have enough hoodies in your closet.Do you find yourself overwhelmed? Is it mentally and emotionally difficult to replace the threadbare one in your closet right now? We're here to help make it easier. The Gear team waded through a ton of hoodies—OK, it wasn’t hard—and picked our favorites for every activity and price point you can imagine.Need to complete the look?

I also added product specifications, our testing methodology, and what we're currently testing. Discontinued hoodies were removed, and prices were updated.Best Hoodie for EverydayCourtesy of American GiantAmerican GiantClassic Full Zip$168 American GiantThis full-zip hoodie from American Giant (the brand's signature product) got a ton of attention when it launched in 2012. The tech columnist Farhad Manjoo, writing for Slate at the time, called it "The Greatest Hoodie Ever Made." Strong words, and over a decade later, the phrase still carries the stench of hyperbole. But I'll tell you something: I got one of these full-zips in 2013, and it's still going strong. I wear it regularly, and it hasn't stretched or frayed, just attractively faded with dozens of washes. The full cotton fleece is indeed very heavy and thick, so much so that it's really only comfortable to wear on colder days. I'll sweat inside of it if the thermometer gets above the low 60s Fahrenheit. (The company also makes a lighter version from a cotton-poly blend that reviewer Martin Cizmar also likes.) The elbows are reinforced with patches, and the hood is double-lined. It's a tank. I can recommend it to anyone who needs something warm and durable that will last forever. And the whole thing is spun and sewn in the US.There are two fits, classic and relaxed. I prefer the classic fit because it's cut slim and snug at the waist (and it has stayed nice and snug through a decade-plus of wear) while leaving plenty of room at the shoulders. The classic cut relaxes the waist a bit if you don't like the snug feeling. —Michael Calore★ If you want a pullover instead: This is the non-zip version of the brand's Classic hoodie. The material is the same—100 percent cotton fleece—and it's all spun and assembled in the US. The durable reinforced elbows and the wind-stopping, double-lined hood are present here as well. The main difference, aside from the lack of a zipper, is a slightly more relaxed cut. It's snug at the waist and roomy in the shoulders, but offers a little more room in the middle. It's just as toasty as the zip-up, too. If you want to see how to wear this properly, check out Michael Che's Netflix comedy special, “Matters.” He wears one on stage.SpecsMaterials100 percent combed ring-spun cottonSizesS-3XColorsBlack, dark charcoal, true navy; limited edition: zinfandel, quiet harbor blue, iceberg greenWashing InstructionsZip garment up to protect zipper before washing; machine wash cool with like colors; warm dryerBest Hoodie on AmazonCourtesy of AmazonChampionReverse Weave Sweatshirt$58 AmazonMuch like a prime ribeye steak, hoodie material needs to be cut the right way. Champion discovered this just before the Second World War when it developed its reverse-weave sweatshirt material by cutting the cotton with its grain instead of against it. This gives it a more pleasing and durable texture and helps prevent uneven shrinkage. A few years later, Champion invented the hoodie at the request of the University of Michigan, which commissioned it to keep participants in its athletics program warm and cozy while filming upcoming opponents stealing play calls playing sports. Today's descendants of the original hooded sweatshirt are a cotton-poly blend that hangs a little loose and heavy compared to many modern sweatshirts but ages gracefully, keeping shape through hundreds of washings. (I only replace a Champion reverse weave once it has a socially inappropriate number of grease stains.) They come in lots of colors and styles. —Martin Cizmar★ Another Amazon favorite: If you want a classic hoodie in 100 percent cotton that is affordable and easily available on Amazon, reviewer Adrienne So usually wears a men's pullover Comfort Colors hoodie. The company uses a dying process called Pigment Pure that uses less water and energy and gives the fabric its signature faded look. She and her children also wear Comfort Colors T-shirts.SpecsMaterials82 percent cotton, 18 percent polyesterSizesXS-3XLColors15+Washing InstructionsMachine wash and dryBest Unisex HoodieCourtesy of NikeNikeSportswear Club Fleece Pullover Hoodie$65 $39 (40% off) Dick's Sporting Goods$68 $42 (38% off) NikeI worked at a Nike store for a year, and I bought this hoodie in at least five colors. It was my uniform—both on and off the clock—and I practically lived in it. The Sportswear Club Fleece hoodie is a staple for everyday wear: standard fit, cozy but not overly slouchy, with ribbed hems and cuffs. It’s also designed with a drawstring hood for when you need a little extra anonymity. During my shifts, I liked to stash the essentials in my kangaroo pocket: phone, lip balm, and emergency Starbursts.Nike recommends your usual size if you wear men’s styles and sizing down if you usually shop women’s. I prefer sizing up (sometimes two sizes) for a relaxed fit. It comes in a ridiculous amount of colors—Nike drops new ones all the time—so if your favorite shade is sold out, there’s a good chance it’ll make a comeback. Mine have survived five years (and counting) of near-daily wear and constant washes, but I recommend air-drying to avoid shrinkage. —Boutayna ChokraneSpecsMaterials80-82 percent cotton, 18-20 percent polyesterSizesXXS-4XL TallColorsVaries based on season and retailerWashing InstructionsMachine wash and dryBest Heavyweight HoodieCourtesy of MadHappyMad HappyClassics Fleece Hoodie$175 Mad HappyMadhappy built its streetwear brand around optimism and mental health awareness, a refreshing message that resonated with its growing cult following (and celebrities like Lebron James and Gigi Hadid). At $175, this is one of the spendier hoodies on this list, but its quality backs up the price; it’s 100 percent cotton, and the subtle details like the embroidered Madhappy logo and hand-stitched hood give it an elevated feel.The fit is already roomy, but I like to drown in my hoodie and can’t help but size up. I love it for travel days; it lets me disappear into my own world at the airport, but paired with the matching sweats, I still look somehow put together. —Boutayna ChokraneSpecsMaterials100 percent cottonSizesXS-XXLColorsBlack, navy, white with navy, white with pink, ash heather; seasonal: blush pink, azureWashing InstructionsMachine wash cold separately; tumble dry lowBest Lightweight HoodieCourtesy of Cozy EarthCozy EarthBamboo Hoodie$98 Cozy EarthI shouldn’t have been surprised by how insanely soft this hoodie is. I’ve tried Cozy Earth’s bamboo sheets before, and the Bamboo Hoodie is equally crazy soft and lightweight. It’s cool to the touch thanks to the bamboo viscose that makes up the majority of the material. It doesn’t have any pockets, and it’s thin, so it’s more of a layering or lounge piece. I loved it most when I would exercise since the lightweight material wouldn’t make me sweaty like other hoodies or top layers might. —Nena FarrellSpecsMaterials62 percent viscose from bamboo, 28 percent acrylic, 10 percent spandexSizesXS-3XColorsCharcoal, graphite, oakmoss, dusty rose, dawnWashing InstructionsMachine wash and dryBest Tall HoodieCourtesy of L.L. BeanL.L. BeanBean's Comfort Camp Hoodie, Graphic$80 L.L. BeanL.L. Bean’s thin, lightweight hoodies are perfect for those gray, crisp, misty mornings when you bring the garbage bin back inside and sip hot coffee while staring out the window. I think what helps with this is its length—it’s quite a long hoodie and the sleeves come all the way down past my wrists (I chose the Tall size due to my height, so I’m not sure how different the Regular size is). It doesn’t feel too tight anywhere, but there’s enough structure that it falls off the body in a complementary way. It’s a great hoodie for doing housework thanks to the soft-knit stretch fabric; you never feel constrained. These come in several colors with varied graphic designs, and there’s often a sale that brings them as low as $50. That’s a bargain. —Julian ChokkattuSpecsMaterials59 percent cotton, 38 percent polyester, and 3 percent spandexSizesS-3XColors10+Washing InstructionsMachine wash and dryBest Hoodie for the OutdoorsCourtesy of HoudiniHoudini SportswearPower Houdi$240 Houdini SportswearAre you a mountaineer or an alpinist, or would you simply like to look like one? Then you probably want a hoodie made from one of Polartec’s stretchy, insulating fabrics that are used in almost every technical midlayer, like the Patagonia R1. Houdini’s Power Houdie is made from Polartec Power Stretch Pro, and it is one of the comfiest garments I’ve ever worn. The bluesign-certified fabric is sustainable as well as thick, stretchy, and brushed for superb comfort, and every time I pull this on, I feel instantly cozy. It has extra stretch that makes it ideal as a base layer for winter activities. The sleeves have added length and thumb loops to avoid cold spots, and the durable face fabric can keep out a chilly breeze far better than a basic down jacket. At 16.8 ounces (478 grams) it weighs plenty and doesn’t pack small, and the cut is long and close to the body. That's great for layering, but not as nice for casual wear. The high neck might also be excessive if you're not on a snowy slope. —Chris HaslamSpecsMaterials57 percent polyester, 33 percent polyamide, 10 percent elastaneSizesXS-XXLColorsRed Illusion, Greenish Gold, Gray, Tribe Blue, Sage Green, True Black, Baremark Green, Blue IllusionWashing InstructionsUse a washing bag; machine wash; tumble dry and/or iron on low heatBest Relaxed FitCourtesy of AritziaAritziaSweatfleece Cozy Perfect Hoodie$80 AritziaThis hoodie was viral on TikTok last year, and to wear it in the TikTok-approved style, you need to purchase it at least two sizes larger than your actual size and wear it with the matching sweatpants, also oversized, in the same color. Sweatfleece has a very distinctive look and feel. The garment is dyed after it’s been completed, and the surface of the fabric is suede. The result is a hoodie with a modern cut, that is as soft and faded as if it’s a zillion years old and as thick and cozy as a new one. I look like a walking mushroom, and I have never been more comfortable. The one downside is that I usually line-dry all my favorite clothes to prolong their lives. Most hoodies take a day at most to dry, but Sweatfleece is so dense that it takes forever to line-dry. I have ended up tossing it in the dryer, and I'm very worried that it will shrink. —Adrienne SoSpecsMaterials78 percent cotton, 22 percent polyesterSizesXXS-XXLColors15+Washing InstructionsMachine washBest Cropped HoodieCourtesy of LululemonLululemonScuba Oversized Half-Zip Hoodie$118 LululemonLast winter, I demanded to see the PowerPoint presentations that our friend’s teenage daughter had sent to her parents as her Christmas wish list. On top was this hoodie. The body and ribbing of the hoodie are over 70 percent cotton, which makes it more breathable than polyester hoodies. But the most distinctive feature is the fit, which is an exaggerated crop that’s noticeable even on me (I’m 5'2''). It has huge sleeves and the distinctive Lululemon scuba hood, which swallows your whole head and zips over your face if you want to sleep during math class. I wore this while traveling with Lulu high-waisted flare Aligns and got mistaken for my kids’ older sister multiple times. —Adrienne SoSpecsMaterialsBody: 70 percent cotton, 30 percent polyester; Mesh: 89 percent nylon, 11 percent elastane; Rib: 97 percent cotton, 3 percent elastaneSizesXS/S, M/L, XL/XXLColors10+Washing InstructionsMachine wash cold and tumble dry lowBest Sustainable HoodieCourtesy of PangaiaPangaia365 Heavyweight Hoodie$210 Pangaia (Women's Sizing)$210 Pangaia (Men's Sizing)Pangaia’s hoodie is what I assume sitting on a cloud feels like. Even donning the hood feels like wrapping my head in a pillow. My wife must think so, too, because this is the hoodie she steals the most. It has a boxier fit, but it’s still flattering, and despite my 6'4'' frame, the sleeves are the perfect length. No kangaroo pockets here! You get individual side pockets for each hand. The heavyweight fabric is enveloping, like a hug, and the inside is brushed for that extra soft touch. Pangaia says it’s treated with peppermint oil for its anti-odor properties, and while I can’t vouch for these claims, I haven’t smelled anything funky even after wearing this hoodie for more than a week (and no, it doesn’t smell like peppermint). You can get matching sweatpants to complete the look.The company is a Certified B Corp, emphasizing responsible manufacturing and fair labor practices. This hoodie is made from 50 percent cotton and 50 percent recycled cotton. —Julian ChokkattuSpecsMaterials50 percent organic cotton, 50 percent recycled cottonSizesXXS-XXLColorsBlack, off-white, sand, stone, navy blue, grey marl; seasonal: soil brownWashing InstructionsGentle machine wash with like colors; iron on reverse; line dry away from direct sunlightBest Alpaca HoodieCourtesy of Arms of AndesArms of AndesAlpaca Wool Hoodie Jacket$285 Arms of AndesIf you would love to love merino, but you find it too scratchy, you might want to consider another fiber—alpaca wool, sheared from the adorable Andean-dwelling camelid. Arms of Andes is a small brand founded by a brother-sister pair who have their entire supply chain based in Peru, to reduce carbon footprint, keep jobs in Peru, and have better oversight of production.Alpaca wool provides the same temperature-regulating, moisture-wicking qualities as merino wool, except that alpacas don't make lanolin, which can sometimes cause an allergic reaction in sensitive people. The fibers are also smoother and finer. This results in by far the softest 100 percent wool garment that I've ever tried—it's so light, soft, and stretchy that I could not believe that it was 100 percent wool and had no nylon blended in. It's also PFAS-free. I wore this as a mid-layer on a 9 degree Fahrenheit day and was warm. The care instructions say that handwashing is preferable, but I've been washing it on a gentle cycle in a machine with no problems. (I do lay it out flat to air dry, however.) It's so soft and easy to layer that I have been wearing it while traveling on a plane and working out in the gym, so I do have to wash it pretty often. —Adrienne SoSpecsMaterials100 percent alpaca woolSizesXS-XLColorsBlack, gray, navy blueWashing InstructionsHand wash or machine wash with like colors on a gentle cycle in cold water; lay the garment flat to dryMore Hoodies to ConsiderWe've tested a bunch of hoodies. They're not all worthy of the top spot, but that doesn't mean they aren't worth buying. Below, we've listed a few more that we think are good but aren't as great as the ones above.Courtesy of FilsonFilson Prospector Hoodie for $129: Pacific Northwest outdoors company Filson gifted me a Prospector Hoodie way back in 2017. Despite it being huge on me, I wore the beefy 13-ounce fleece for years. It washed brilliantly, it was warm, it coped with abuse, and it became my at-home hoodie of choice. For the past few years, after passing it along, my brother-in-law has rarely been seen without it. There are all manner of stains on it from daily abuse and countless fishing trips, but the fabric remains in great condition, the shape is true, and there’s virtually no fraying. Made using 75 percent cotton and 25 percent polyester, it’s impossible to recycle, which is a shame, but at least as a family, we’re getting decades of wear from it. —Chris HaslamCarhartt Men's Loose Fit Midweight Sweatshirt for $55: Do you have a rugged, outdoorsy job, like roofing or wrangling horses on a movie set? Or would you simply like to dress like this is a possibility? Then you might want to consider Carhartt's loose-fit sweatshirt. This all-cotton hoodie with triple-stitched seams holds up to all the rigors of reviewer Martin Cizmar's lifestyle, which includes everything from driving his truck to Target to basic lawn work. The Carhartt hoodie has a looser fit than many and breathes extremely well thanks to a looser weave. —Adrienne SoMinus33 Merino Wool Hoodie for $220: When you want to stay warm, few fabrics can match merino wool. It's a super fiber, which is why we have an entire guide to merino wool, and this Minus33 hoodie is one of our favorites. It's soft and comfy, made of 95 percent merino wool and 5 percent Spandex to give it a little stretch. It's easy to care for: You can machine wash and tumble dry it. It won't shrink or lose its shape, and the colors won't bleed. We also like that Minus33 offers a wide range of sizes, from X-small to XXL. I've been impressed with its durability; it's stood up to kid life, climbing trees, and running through the woods. And the hand warmers pair well with mittens on cold days. —Scott GilbertsonCourtesy of Popflex ActivePopflex Cloud Hoodie for $70: I got this on a recommendation from a fellow WIRED staffer who said this was the perfect hoodie (for women), and I’m here to tell you that they were absolutely right. The Popflex Cloud Hoodie has a nice midweight to it, a soft (though not overly plush) interior lining, and a baggy design that doesn’t make me look like a marshmallow looking for a campfire. The waist of the hoodie gathered nicely at my natural waist, and the drop shoulders and massive hood draped over my upper body while still retaining its form and structure. Honestly, I look way cooler than I actually am in this hoodie, especially since it tends to casually slip off one shoulder. It looks good with well-fitting jeans and leggings, and comes in so many colors that I have to resist buying another every day. —Nena FarrellFjällräven Vardag Hoodie for $105: This is one of editor Adrienne So's favorite hoodies; it's made from 100 percent PFAS-free cotton. The cotton is a little thinner and the fit is boxier than the American Giant above.Everlane Men's Off-Duty Terry Hoodie for $98: Editor Adrienne So tried this hoodie. She likes the color selection, the relaxed fit, and the finished ends on the drawstring cords, but the price is too high for a hoodie that is thin, only 67 percent cotton, and has mostly unremarkable design details.TheraHoodie for $158: Thera's weighted hoodie is sadly too heavy to wear out while running errands, but it's ideal for wearing around the house (especially after a stressful day). Our only gripe is that sometimes a few beads fall out of the pockets.Paka Alpaca Hoodie for $149: Editor Adrienne So also tried this hoodie. The exterior is 70 percent baby alpaca with 30 percent Tencel, with a 100 percent organic cotton interior. In theory, it should be softer and lighter than the Arms of Andes hoodie above, but it's not. She does like the moderate price, the pockets, and the scattershot textured woven color scheme.Richer Poorer Recycled Fleece Hoodie for $82: Reviewer Nena Farrell notes that this hoodie nails the fit. It also saves approximately 40 bottles from the landfill with each purchase.Branwyn Hoodie Pullover for $225: We love everything Branwyn makes, and this hoodie is exceptionally warm and soft, with extra features like thumb holes and a kangaroo pocket. However, for the same price, the Minus33 has a higher merino content and a wider range of sizes.How We Test HoodiesAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronMultiple writers on WIRED's gear team have contributed to this guide, but we test all hoodies by wearing them regularly for multiple activities, from walking the dog, going running, wearing them to the gym, and wearing them in at least seven Zoom meetings minimum per day. We also put all of our hoodies through several wash and wear cycles to test how the fabric will hold up over time. Does the material feel soft? Have the colors faded or the stitching come loose?We also judge it based on fit, including how the cut and waistband fit along with the length of the sleeves. Most importantly, we make sure it's comfortable and worth the investment. If it's a hoodie we find ourselves constantly reaching for in our closet, then it's safe to say it's WIRED-approved.What Are We Testing Next?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronI'll be testing the Uniqlo Windproof Fleece Reversible Full-Zip Hoodie for $60 and the Reigning Champ Midweight Terry Standard Hoodie for $128.CommentsBack to topTriangleBoutayna Chokrane is a product writer and reviewer at WIRED, covering consumer products and online trends.
