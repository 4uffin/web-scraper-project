Slowly, that has changed. Ebikes are now lighter, more attractive, and more powerful than ever. You don't need to be physically fit to ride one. You can use them to commute to work or to keep up with your fitter, faster pals on a mountain bike ride. They get you outside, reduce traffic congestion, and shrink your carbon footprint. I ride one daily to take my kids to school. They're just fun.Right now, my top pick is the Trek FX+ 1 ($2,000), but my personal electric bicycle, the Tern GSD, also got a pretty big upgrade this year. If you don't see what you want, check back later (or drop me a note!). Need more bike gear? Don't forget to check out our guides to the Best Bike Lights, Best Bike Helmets, or Best Bike Locks.Updated August 2025: We've added the Trek FX+ 1, the Tern GSD (3rd Gen), the Priority Current Plus, and Bike Friday All-Day.Next UpAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWe are currently testing the RadRunner Max ($2,299), the Specialized Turbo Levo 4 Expert ($10,000), the Urban Arrow FamilyNext Pro ($8,999), the Lectric XP Trike 2 ($1,499), and the Surly Skid Loader ($3,999).Best Electric BikePhotograph: Adrienne SoTrekFX+ 1$2,000 TrekSearching for your first ebike? I strongly suggest going with an established manufacturer with a large support network of affiliated retailers and shops, so you can test a few and not have to assemble or fix it yourself. Even with tariffs and supply chain uncertainty, $2,000 is about what I'd expect to spend on a durable, good-quality entry-level electric bike.Almost every major bike manufacturer now makes an entry-level commuter electric bicycle. Trek has two new offerings in the commuter line, with the entry-level FX+ 1 as the most affordable version with the lighter Hyena motor, and the FX+ 7S (9/10, WIRED Recommends) with the silent, smooth TQ HPR50 motor as the upgrade. There are a few notable upgrades to the FX+ 1: First, it has a throttle in addition to pedal assist, which makes it a Class 2 ebike. Second, it has Trek's new EasyMag charging system, which is nuts. It's MagSafe for your electric bike, and just putting your charger on the top tube is so much easier than trying to align a bunch of little pins. It also has dedicated buttons for turn signals, which is fun. However, I am getting much less than the advertised 50 miles of range, so I'd keep a charger at work if you're commuting.SpecsMotor: 250-watt Hyena rear hub | Battery: 250/540 Wh | Recommended Height: 4'10" to 6'6" | Total Payload: 300 poundsBest Cargo Electric BicyclePhotograph: Adrienne SoPhotograph: Adrienne SoPhotograph: Adrienne SoPhotograph: Adrienne SoChevronChevronTernGSD S10 (3rd Gen)$7,249 Clever Cycles$7,599 Electric Bike AttackThis is the updated version of my own electric bike. The newest Tern GSD (9/10, WIRED Recommends) has a couple of significant upgrades—it's the first bike I've ever tested with ABS brakes, which I understand seems slightly overkill. It also didn't seem to make that much of a difference, even when I loaded up the panniers with wood and mulch and went up and down the biggest hill in my neighborhood.However, I know it will feel much different if you're a year-round biker and have to bike up and down hills in the rain. All the components—like the kickstand, rear racks, and brakes—are all tested to the DIN 79010, which is the only existing safety standard for cargo bikes. Its child-friendly accessories are also the most extensive and best I've seen. Tern sets the gold standard if you're biking with small children, although I must note that one battery does not provide a lot of range, so opt for the double battery.SpecsMotor: Bosch Cargo Line mid-drive | Battery: 545 Wh | Recommended Height: 5' to 6'5" | Total Payload: 463 poundsBest Out of the BoxVvoltAlpha II$2,099 VvoltIf you're filled with dread about having to assemble an ebike you bought online, the Vvolt Alpha II might be just the ticket for you. The new model from Oregon-based Vvolt came closer to roadworthy than any of the other eight ebikes I've tested and was ready to ride in less than 20 minutes. It's also a standout when it comes to pedal power, thanks to a Goldilocks geometry that strikes the right balance between an upright Dutch-style city bike and a standard American hybrid. Since it's only 45 pounds and comfortable to pedal, it's one of the few ebikes I wouldn't grouse about moving for 5 or 10 miles using only my own energy. This is especially welcome as the only downside I've found in a dozen short school commutes covering 40 miles is that the battery isn't lasting close to the advertised 45 miles. (I'm a larger person and do use the throttle sometimes, but I have gotten as few as 12 miles before the battery started blinking.) You get features like a carbon-fiber chain and five levels of assist for less than $2,000. —Martin CizmarSpecsMotor: Ananda 350-watt rear hub | Battery: 374 Wh | Recommended Height: 4'9" to 6'3" | Total Payload: 300 poundsThe Best Upgraded EbikePhotograph: Adrienne SoSpecializedTurbo Vado SL 2$6,000 SpecializedIf you're ready to upgrade, you should get the Specialized Turbo Vado SL 2, which is so stunningly beautiful and fun to ride that I find myself running many more dumb little errands around my neighborhood just so I have an excuse to stay on it.It has a bigger motor and a bigger battery than the Trek FX+ 7. Specialized's app is better—in addition to the usual motor turning/navigation/battery status displays, you can remotely lock it with your phone. The bike is integrated with Apple's Find My, so iPhone users like me can locate it should it get stolen. And Specialized's proprietary accessories are also just better. I love my Po Campo bags, but the Coolcave panniers are probably my favorite bike accessory. I dump whatever gooey things my kids are holding when I pick them up from school, and rinse and drain when we get home.I find Trek's TQ motor to be ever so slightly more natural, as I feel Specialized's custom motor whirring into action when I put weight on the front pedal to move forward. The two bikes weigh the same, if weight is an issue. However, if I could buy another bike (must not buy another bike!) I would get a Specialized, and so should you.SpecsMotor: Specialized 320-watt mid-drive | Battery: 520 Wh | Recommended Height: 5'1" to 6'4" | Total Payload: 300 poundsBest Ebike for CommutingPhotograph: REIREI Co-op CyclesCTY e2.1 Electric Bike$1,799 REIOutdoor retailer REI sells a few versions of its city commuter line. The most bare-bones version is the CTY e1.1 ($1,299), but I think it's worth upgrading to the REI Co-op CTY e2.1, which is still well under $2,000 and goes on sale often. It's a class 1 ebike with a 250-watt Suntour HESC motor, a 418-Wh battery, and a whole host of commuter extras, like front suspension, hydraulic disc brakes, big 2-inch-wide tires, gel grips, lights, and a hefty kickstand.It's not the fanciest bike out there. It weighs a hefty 54 pounds and has a little less torque than some of our other picks, so it might not have quite enough oomph to get you up some of the bigger hills. But you don't need an app to use it, and it's reasonably priced. If you live near an REI, the store shop will assemble it and offer discounts on maintenance and free tubes, and you have a 365-day return policy.SpecsMotor: Suntour HESC 250-watt rear hub | Battery: 418 Wh | Recommended Height: 5' to 6'3" | Total Payload: 300 poundsBest Folding Electric BicyclePhotograph: Courtesy of BromptonBromptonElectric G Line$3,500 BromptonThe Brompton Electric G Line (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is the best folding electric bike. Bromptons fold to an unbelievably one-third of their full size and are as irresistible as little candy M&Ms. It has undergone several updates since I first reviewed the electric line in 2021, the most significant being that this is a burlier bike meant for trails.I really like parts of the design, which include a removable battery pack that you clip onto the handlebars. My UK colleague Chris Haslam noted that the steering has gotten better, and the bike absorbs every bump with ease. The geometry has been tweaked to make it more comfortable to ride, as well. While it is considerably bigger than the lightest non-electric Brompton, it's in line with what other electric bikes weigh. The company has even included new bearings on the rolling wheels, so you can push it smoothly instead of carrying it on public transport.SpecsMotor: 250-watt rear hub | Battery: 345 kWh | Recommended Height: 4'7" to 6'8" | Total Payload: 242 poundsBest Budget Electric BicyclePhotograph: Adrienne SoLectricXPress 750$1,665 $1,299 (22% off) LectricI have not always been a fan of Lectric! But the company's bikes have seriously improved over the past year. The XPress rides like a much more “bikey” bike, with a traditional (and comfortable!) frame and a new torque sensor that makes pedaling feel natural. Its 86 Nm of torque is powerful enough to get up the steepest hill in my neighborhood, which I've named Battery Killer, though I have found the range much less than the promised 60 miles. Using the throttle generously, I get around 25 miles, and I’m only 115 pounds—the range really should be better than that, so much so that I don't recommend downgrading to the XPress 500 ($999).Still, for zipping around your neighborhood as fast as possible, this is a pretty great bike for the price. It gets up to 28 mph quickly. The LCD is huge, bright, and easy to read, and the controls are simple to understand. You don't need an app, and it has hydraulic disc brakes, integrated lights—the works. Lectric is a direct-to-consumer company, but its assembly process is also one of the easiest I've experienced. This is the best entry-level electric bike right now.SpecsMotor: 750-watt rear hub | Battery: 48 volts | Recommended Height: 5'4" to 6'4" | Total Payload: 330 poundsBest Mountain EbikePhotograph: Trek BikesTrek Slash+ 9.7 SLX/XT$8,000 $7,700 (4% off) TrekTrek took the frame of its popular Slash mountain bike and added a motor and battery to create the quietest, most natural-feeling electric mountain bike that reviewer Steph Pearson has ever tested. The Slash+ (9/10, WIRED Recommends) has two standout features. The TQ motor has a pin ring drive transmission, which replaces the whirring gears and cogs of a normal motor with two rings with differently-sized pins (it's physics, look it up). Also, there's an extra idler pulley to take up slack on the chain and reduce pedal kickback, which is when your pedals suddenly reverse direction when you're not paying attention and claw at your shins.The result is a delightful, floaty ride that gives you just enough assistance when you need it and doesn't feel like you're trying to drive a tank through tight, technical turns. Pearson did note a small, persistent rattle that neither she nor her bike shop could identify or fix, but that seems a small downside considering how fun this bike is otherwise.SpecsMotor: TQ 250-watt mid-drive | Battery: 580 Wh | Recommended Height: 5'1" to 6'5" | Total Payload: 300 poundsBest Comfy CruiserCourtesy of PriorityPhotograph: Ryan WaniataPhotograph: Ryan WaniataPhotograph: Ryan WaniataChevronChevronPriorityCurrent Plus$3,299 PriorityThe Priority Current Plus (8/10, WIRED Recommends) looks like Priority’s easygoing, entry-level sit-up cruiser bikes, but it comes with tons of upgrades. These upgrades include a more powerful mid-drive motor that classifies the bike as a Class 2 hybrid that converts to a Class 3, a Carbon Gates drive belt, a powerful 720-Wh battery, and options to swap in an Enviolo hub.SpecsMotor: 500-watt mid-drive | Battery: 720 Wh | Recommended Height: 5' to 6'3" | Total Payload: 275 poundsBest Utility EbikePhotograph: SpecializedSpecializedGlobe Haul ST$2,500 SpecializedI've been waiting for a major bike manufacturer to release an affordable, reliable daily driver that can be a car substitute. The Specialized Globe Haul ST (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is the company's first light cargo ebike, and it's a winner. It fits a wide variety of heights. The powerful 700-watt motor relies on an IPX7-rated battery with a remarkable range of well over the stated 60 miles. The display is intuitive, and the pedaling feels natural. The compact 20-inch multi-terrain wheels are maneuverable and feel stable on roads, dirt, and gravel.The proprietary accessories utilize partners like Fjallraven and are attractive and versatile. But I have two small qualms: There's no suspension, which can make a difference if you're carrying a lot of things and people; and there's no belt drive. However, Specialized uses quality components and has a large network of affiliated shops to get routine maintenance. This is the bike that everyone in my family—me, my husband, and my two kids—asks to ride whenever we leave the house.SpecsMotor: Globe 700-watt rear hub | Battery: 772 Wh | Recommended Height: 4'5" to 6'4" | Total Payload: 419 poundsSafest for Battery FiresPhotograph: Rad Power BikesRad Power BikesRadster Road$2,199 Rad Power BikesIf you want an electric bike, do not be put off by fears of battery fires—new legislation and new technology make each iteration of electric bike safer than the one before. For example, Seattle-based Rad Power Bikes recently introduced a new technology called Safe Shield, in which the batteries are encapsulated in heat-absorbing resin to extinguish a fire, much like the batteries in an electric car. If you're concerned about electric battery fires, one of the bikes in the new line-up, like the Radster Road (8/10, WIRED Recommends), would be your best pick. (It's also worth noting that every bike in our roundup has UL certification, which means it meets the safety requirements of a top third-party testing agency.)The Radster Road is a long-distance commuter that is UL-certified, with big, efficient 29-inch Kenda tires, an IPX6-rated 750-watt rear hub motor, and a 720-Wh proprietary semi-integrated battery. It has a truly ridiculous range (I put about 30 miles on it and only wore the battery down halfway) and comes with a ton of stuff at a very reasonable price. For example, you can switch between ebike classes on the computer, and it has a new torque sensor that makes pedaling feel infinitely more natural. It's also a lot quieter than other bikes at this price. It does weigh almost 75 pounds, though.SpecsMotor: 750-watt rear hub | Battery: 720 Wh | Recommended Height: 4'11" to 5'8" | Total Payload: 320 poundsBest Ebike for Road RacersPhotograph: Will MatsudaSanta Cruz BicyclesSkitch$6,499 Backcountry$6,199 Mike's BikesIf you're a road cyclist who wants the lightest bike around so that you can commute 15 miles to work and pop through a park on your way home, the bike you're looking for is the Santa Cruz Skitch (9/10, WIRED Recommends). It has an extremely light carbon fiber frame, with an equally light but powerful Fazua 60 motor and a 430-watt-hour battery. It's a class 3 ebike and also the lightest electric bike I've ever tried. My tester came with all the fixings, including a dropper seat post and a very fancy SRAM button transmission that let me click through gears easily and seamlessly, with no exposed cabling. I cackled with glee as I tried to race a Dodge Challenger home in my neighborhood and swung through a cyclocross course.It does cost $6,000, which puts a damper on your gleeful commuting—one does not simply leave a Ferrari parked and unattended in front of the 7-Eleven at midnight. But if you have a 10-mile commute and access to a locked garage, this would be my pick.SpecsMotor: 450-watt mid-drive | Battery: 430 Wh | Recommended Height: 5'1" to 6'6" | Total Payload: n/aBest Cheap Cargo EbikePhotograph: AventonAventonAbound LR$1,999 AventonAventon updated the popular Abound cargo ebike and made two versions. The Aventon Abound LR is the long-tail, while the Abound SR ($1,899) is shorter and slightly cheaper. I tested the Abound LR, which is an excellent little cargo ebike that comes with a built-in rack, fenders, lights, and a surprisingly nimble 750-watt rear hub motor.This class 2 ebike has up to 60 miles of range (or more like 30 with my 210-pound, 6'2" frame), and it rides much like the commuter bikes you might be familiar with, just with smaller wheels to accommodate the rack on the rear. I love how affordable this bike is, at less than $2,000, and I love the rigidity offered by Aventon’s newer dual-walled frame. The fact that the Aventon downstem for the seat comes with a built-in shock absorber that you can adjust with a bike tool is also awesome. This bike feels sturdy enough to haul up to a 440-pound payload, and remains comfortable while you’re doing it. The only downside? The gearing is odd; you’ll have to pedal like mad to keep up with the 20-mile-per-hour speed you’ll easily achieve with the throttle. —Parker HallSpecsMotor: 750-watt Shengyi rear hub | Battery: 733 Wh | Recommended Height: 4'11" to 6'3" | Total Payload: 440 poundsBest Electric Bike Made by a Car ManufacturerPhotograph: Stephanie PearsonFordBronco Electric Bike$4,500 FordWhen reviewer Steph Pearson took the Ford Bronco electric bike (6/10, WIRED Review) for a spin, she noted that it's part of a trend—car manufacturers want to get in on that sweet, sweet ebike action. (Rivian also recently announced a new ebike company.) It has a powerful 750-watt motor, Pirelli tires, an integrated cockpit with an analog speedometer, and an enormous, 2,000-lumen headlight. It looks a bit like a motocross bike or an enduro bike, but it also looks like a Bronco. (You can get a custom Bronco paint job for an additional $390.)Pearson noted that the Bronco is a powerful, lively ride, if a bit cramped for someone who is 5'9". It has four modes—Eco, Normal, Sport, and Baja—but Pearson noted that it feels like you're supposed to lean back and ride it at full power, like on a Ducati. It's fabulously fun, but the battery has a shorter range than you might expect for such a heavy bike. Still, if you're nostalgic for a Bronco, this might be a bargain. Until the end of June, people who buy or even only test the Ford Bronco or its sibling Ford Mustang eBike at a participating US Ford or Pedego dealer can enter to win an actual $40,000 Ford Bronco Big Bend Edition automobile.SpecsMotor: 750-watt rear hub | Battery: 720 Wh | Recommended Height: 5'4" to 6'5" | Total Payload: 400 poundsBest Mini Electric BikePhotograph: JackRabbitJackrabbitPro Micro-Ebikes$1,650 Jackrabbit (OG2 Pro)$2,250 Jackrabbit (XG Pro)Reviewer Matthew Korfhage described the Jackrabbit OG2 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) as “a wee scooter that looks like a bicycle.” While it's marketed as an electric bike and looks like an electric bike, it has footrests instead of pedals, and you power forward via the throttle. It's completely tiny and completely adorable. (I reviewed the original Jackrabbit when it debuted in 2021 and also noted that everyone loves it, especially in its bright candy colors.) A micro ebike is also incredibly convenient for urban living, as you can stash it in a restaurant, car trunk, or apartment pretty easily as you're moving about the city.At 6'1" and 200+ pounds, Korfhage pushed the limit on the OG2's stated specs. But it's worth noting that the Jackrabbit is easily customizable, with optional RangeBuster battery extenders ($400). It's also a bit expensive compared to the previous model, and only having rear brakes is nerve-wracking at top speed. Still, it is a tiny, customizable, and adorable ebike. Korfhage might not be a “Jacko,” as Jackrabbit’s devoted users call themselves, but he is a fan.SpecsMotor: 500-watt rear hub | Battery: 360-Wh | Recommended Height: 4'9" to 6'2" | Total Payload: 275 poundsBest TricyclePhotograph: SixThreeZero Bike Co.SixThreeZeroEvryJourney Tricycle$1,300 SixThreeZeroIf balancing upright is your top priority, you might want to consider a tricycle. SixThreeZero's bike keeps you in a comfortable, upright position without having to balance on a leg to keep it upright. It has a 250-watt motor with 40 miles on a charge and a top speed of up to 15 mph when you use the throttle. A big rear basket fits a load of groceries or even your puppy. However, it does weigh over 70 pounds and is pretty bulky; you'll need a garage to store it. As our reviewer Stephanie Pearson says, three wheels can be almost as fun as two.SpecsMotor: 250-watt rear hub | Battery: 374.4 Wh | Recommended Height: 5' to 6'2" | Total Payload: 300 poundsOther Ebikes We LikeBike Friday All-Day
Photograph: Adrienne SoBike Friday All-Day for $5,200: Bike Friday bills the irresistibly tiny All-Day (7/10, WIRED Review) as the world's lightest Bosch-powered ebike, and it's true. You can customize all the colors and components of this folding electric bike, and it has a surprisingly powerful motor for its size. The Brompton above is more widely available and easier to use, but I love this little bike a lot.Radio Flyer Via Pro for $2,899: Editor Julian Chokkattu could not have had a better experience than this easy-to-use and easy-to-assemble class 2 electric cargo bike. For more info, check out our guide to the Best Electric Cargo Bikes.Aventon Level 3 for $1,899: The Aventon Level 3 is an easy-to-ride ebike that features a clean, step-through design and every feature you could want in a standard-size ebike for riding around town. There are built-in fenders and lights, and a big color display shows you how much of the up to 70 miles of advertised range you have remaining. I have ridden it up to about 25 miles at a time with my heavy 6'2" frame, easily ending my rides with 20 percent of battery left. The frame feels comfortable and sturdy, thanks to a double-walled construction and improved Shimano gears and brakes. The front suspension fork and semi-hidden suspension seat post add to comfort relative to other bikes I’ve tested in this price range, and I like that the Aventon app lets you set up things like remote locking and geofencing, so you can keep an eye on your expensive bike from afar. The built-in turn signals, which use the bike’s rear lights, are another bonus when riding in cities at night. —Parker HallTenways CGO800S for $1,999: This is a budget step-through city ebike. It boasts up to 50 miles of battery life, and I got more than 30. The torque sensor is smooth and responsive to pedaling at various speeds. However, there's no throttle, and because this bike is meant to fit riders of a huge range of sizes (they say 5'1'' to 6'3''), the frame was not as comfortable to pedal for me (5'11") as some large-size bikes. —Martin CizmarEngwe LE20 for $1,899: The selling point of this bike is that for $1,500, you get a cargo bike with room for a massive payload and two high-capacity batteries, which is theoretically able to traverse 211 miles while carrying a 165-pound rider. The batteries only carried me about 80 miles on a single charge (I weigh a lot more and didn't pedal as much as I could have) during three days of testing on America's longest rail-to-trail project, but still, that's a wow stat. This is the roughest assembly job I've had with a DTC ebike, and I ultimately did take it into a shop where the owner congratulated me on the wise decision to not ride it as-is. With weight pushing 100 pounds, it's not easy to load up for travel—you're not putting this thing on a rack. It carries cargo with ease, and with the $170 fast-charger upgrade, you can cover serious mileage in a day. —Martin CizmarAventon Ramblas for $2,599: Aventon made a mountain bike! It's a lot of bike for an affordable price, but just a little too heavy to take out for its intended use case. It makes a nice, rugged commuter, however.Linus eDutchi for $1,799: Need a comfy cruiser? The Linus eDutchi is a comfy class 1 ebike with beautiful colors and loads of proprietary accessories.Electra Loft Go!
Photograph: ElectraElectra Loft Go! for $1,200: I also love the Electra Loft Go! (7/10, WIRED Recommends), which is another comfy sit-up beach cruiser, but the Priority has a slightly more powerful motor for the same price.Xtracycle Estoker for $4,499: This is probably the bike that I see most often in my Portland, Oregon, neighborhood. It has a durable, sturdy Chromoly steel frame and larger 24-inch wheels, along with a Shimano mid-drive motor that makes it perfect for more grueling conditions. Unfortunately, you do have to be over 5'6" (which I am not) to ride it.Gazelle Eclipse for $6,399: If you want to know just how great the Bosch system can be, the Eclipse (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is the more expensive version of the Radster Road above. It has a nicer shifter, a smarter motor—even the paint job is nicer. It's just much more expensive.Heybike Tyson for $1,399: You get a lot of stuff for not very much money with the Tyson (6/10, WIRED Review), a fat-tire, folding ebike that includes suspension, blinkers, a throttle, and one of the most obnoxious horns I've ever heard. The components are not super-high-quality, but it's an affordable, comfortable way to dip your toes into ebike waters.The Gocycle G4I+ for $5,999: Gocycle's high-end, fast-folding luxury bikes are designed by a former McLaren engineer. This quieter, lighter iteration has better torque, a new carbon-fiber front fork, and an even more painful price.The Bunch Original Electric Cargo Bike for $6,499: I didn't care for the Bunch (5/10, WIRED Review), but my family did. It's a standard, if slightly expensive, box bike as you might see in Europe. It'll work well if you live in a flat area and don't have to go very fast.Bikes We DislikePass on the left.The Retrospec Jax Rev
Photograph: RetrospecThe Retrospec Jax Rev for $1,000: We wanted to love this sleek, stylish folding bike, but we couldn't help worrying about its durability.Niu Electric Bike BQi-C3 Pro for $1.699: Commerce director Martin Cizmar tested this bike and had a litany of complaints. The riding position is too aggressive, and the bike frame doesn't fit common components like a water bottle and his pannier. The disc brakes weren't suited to stopping it from 28 mph.FAQsHow Does WIRED Procure Ebikes?Bike companies reach out to me, and I request testers in my size. Once I have finished testing, I either return the bikes to the manufacturer, the shop that assembled them, or donate them to nonprofit organizations.How Do You Secure an Ebike?Many ebikes have removable batteries, displays, or built-in wheel locks that make securing your bike much easier. Other bikes, like the Specialized Turbo Vado SL 2, are also compatible with Apple Find My. Check out our Best Ebike Locks guide for more options.Should I Build My Own Bike?Many affordable bikes now come direct-to-consumer—meaning that they are pre-tuned or partially assembled in a box. As Peter Flax recently noted in Bicycling magazine, these bikes do not get nearly the testing or vetting that bikes from a bigger manufacturer get. Unless you're not riding much or for many miles, or are experienced with modifying your own bike, I recommend working with an established manufacturer that has a dealer network.What Terrain Do You Live On?If you live in a flat area, you're probably fine with a 250-watt motor, which is the European speed standard. However, if you live near hills or haul a lot of stuff, you might want to consider a 500-watt or 750-watt motor and a few extras, like hydraulic disc brakes, which will help prevent you from skidding into traffic.How Do I Prevent Bike Fires?The idea of your garage suddenly setting alight is terrifying, but don't worry—the batteries that manufacturers use today are much safer than those of yore. We only write about bikes that have been certified safe by a third-party organization. Also, exercise a bit of common sense. Do not leave your bike battery charging overnight in a boiling hot garage. Don't use aftermarket accessories to charge your bike. And don't plug in a battery that has deformed or smells weird, or try to turn on a bike with a cracked display or computer.Follow Some Basic Safety TipsNot sure where to start? The biking advocacy group PeopleForBikes has a safety education program, E-Bike Smart, which it created in collaboration with the League of American Bicyclists and Bicycle Colorado. Do not let your children ride your bike unsupervised. An 80-pound child should not be piloting a 65-pound bike, even if the motor makes it possible for them to do so. And always wear a helmet, but you already know that. Right?How We TestAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronOver the past few years, WIRED's Reviews team has tried almost every kind of electric bike, from the best heavy-duty cargo bikes to high-end mountain bikes. We review upward of 50 new ebikes a year by riding them on a variety of terrain for at least 40 miles over the course of at least two weeks. We test cargo bikes by hauling kids and groceries, we ride mountain and gravel bikes on trails, and we test commuter bikes while running errands on regular city streets (including up and down steep hills). In addition to our real-life testing, we also evaluate specs like weight, tire size, battery life, motor power, and the sourcing of key components.It Costs What Now?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWhenever I talk to anyone about a possible ebike purchase, the biggest deterrent is usually the price. If this is you, check out our guide to the Best Cheap Ebikes. But I do want to say here that these are vehicles, not toys. When I'm carrying my kids to school or flying down a hill at 25 mph, I want the safest possible ride, and I think you should too.Reasonable auto financing options are the only reason a $2,000 electric bike can feel prohibitively expensive while a $6,000 beater gas-powered car has easy monthly payments. Many states now feature incentive programs that offer rebates or tax credits for ebike purchases. Some bike manufacturers and retailers offer financing through companies like Affirm or PayPal. Your bank might cover ebikes under its vehicle loan program, and I also recommend looking at eBay locally, Craigslist, or local Facebook groups. You probably have more options than you think.Ebike Classifications and RulesAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronBefore you buy your electric bike, make sure you can actually use it! Many cities and states have laws regulating when and where you can ride an ebike. Check out our guide on the three classes of ebikes. At least 22 states now use this three-class system, and they may restrict when and where different classes of ebikes are used, depending on whether they have a throttle or can assist above 20 mph. Cities may also have laws about whether mountain ebikes are allowed on single-track trails. If your state classifies ebikes under the same laws governing motorcycles and mopeds, you may need a license to ride one.Power up with unlimited access to WIRED.
