Today, robot vacuums can pick up socks and warn your dishwasher that a robber is in your house, alongside the now-standard array of features like self-emptying bins, mop washing, and more.Cleaning a dynamic environment like an ever-changing house is a complex task. I have a two-story family home with elementary-school-aged kids and two active dogs, and, as a working parent, I find robot vacuums indispensable. Whether you’re choking on cat hair or just want to spend more time with your family, we have a robot vacuum that will help.Check out our other cleaning guides, including the Best Dyson Vacuums, Best Carpet Cleaners, Best Cordless Vacuums, and Best Air Purifiers.

We also added a specs table, a Next Up box, and updated links and prices. We will next be testing the Mova Z60 Ultra Roller Complete ($1,199) and the Yeedi S20 Infinity ($1,100).Best Robot Vacuum MopPhotograph: AmazonRoborockQrevo S$800 Amazon$750 WalmartNote: Roborock recently updated the Qrevo line with the Qrevo Curv 2 Pro, but it's currently not shipping to the United States. We will update this review when we can test it.Roborock makes a bewildering array of vacuums at various prices. Happily, they all work and age well, so if you buy last year's model, you won't miss out on much. The Qrevo S is 2024's update to the midrange Qrevo line. It's smaller than its predecessor, with slightly less suction at 7,000 Pa versus the 10,000 or even 18,000 Pa Roborock offers in its higher-end vacs. However, I have found that more suction doesn't matter as much if you're cleaning regularly (it may even bald your carpets!). What's important is that the Qrevo S has everything you need—multifunctional vacuuming and mopping, automatic bin emptying, and mop washing—for a not-insane price.The Qrevo S uses lidar, or pulsed laser, navigation to build maps and navigate around obstacles, instead of using a camera, which I appreciate, as I prefer to keep pictures of my house and possessions from floating around the internet, if possible. It also has an AI-enabled feature called SmartPlan, where, instead of selecting which cleaning mode you want on which part of your house, the robot vacuum will select it for you. I was extremely skeptical, but SmartPlan does, in fact, work, vacuuming the carpeted rooms before vacuuming and then mopping the hardwood and tiled bathroom and kitchen. It can save up to four maps in the app, so you can carry it around to clean your whole house. This is the robot vacuum I recommend that my friends and family buy.SpecsNavigation type: Lidar (no cameras)Suction: 8,000 PaMultifloor mapping: YesDual-function mop and vac: YesWIRED/TIREDAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWIREDAffordableAccurateReliableTIREDStarting to become outdatedNew models don't ship to the US yetA Game-Changing Robot Vacuum and MopPhotograph: Adrienne SoMaticRobot Vacuum$1,095 MaticI would be doing you a disservice if I did not say that the Matic robot vacuum (10/10, WIRED Recommends) is spectacular. This is the only 10/10 rating I have ever given in over a decade of reviewing products. It stands out in an unceasing parade of identical disc vacuums by solving many pain points I never knew I had.It has six RGB infrared cameras, so it can create seamless, detailed 3D models of your home, see above itself in space, and see in the dark. It creates an absolute map instead of a relative one, so it doesn't get confused if you move it or move a chair. The waste bag contains wet and dry debris, so you don't have to clog your laundry sink drain with horrible-smelling brown water that's full of dog hair. You can teach it how to get around obstacles, it cleans the toe kicks (the little recesses under your kitchen and oven that make space for your toes as you stand), and it's so quiet I can run it in the living room under my kids' feet while they're watching TV. You can share the app and control of the vacuum with your spouse or family members, too. And unlike many of the other robot vacuums here, it's remarkably compact. It doesn't make you find space to install an enormous docking station.There are two caveats with the Matic. The first is that the suction power is remarkably low. But it's so thorough that I can honestly say I haven't noticed a decrease in efficacy. The second is that while the proprietary waste bags are miraculous—they have diaper salts, charcoal, and a HEPA filter in them so you don't have to replace filters separately—they are expensive, and I can fill one in three days. Matic says that one bag usually lasts one to four weeks, so I hold my kids and dogs mostly responsible for this. The second is that you order via a direct-to-consumer website and not from a easily accessible retailer. For some of you, however, this may be a bonus.SpecsNavigation type: Long-term (absolute SLAM) with RBG IR camerasSuction: 3,200 PaMultifloor mapping: YesDual-function mop and vac: YesWIRED/TIREDAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWIREDAstonishingly affordableCompactUnique navigation systemDirty water disposal isn't disgustingTIREDOnly available through manufacturerWet/dry bags are heinously expensiveBest Basic Robot VacuumPhotograph: Adrienne So3iG10+ Robot Vacuum$450 $300 (33% off) AmazonI was shocked by the specs and offerings of this compact robot vacuum that doesn't even come with a docking station! The G10+ has an enormous 1-liter dustbin (most robot vacuums have an onboard dustbin that is about half that size), and the dustbin has an internal compression paddle inside and a UV light. It continually compresses and disinfects everything it picks up—3i claims that you don't have to empty it for up to 60 days, but that test lab is much cleaner than my house. Still, going for a week without emptying an onboard dustbin in my very messy home with multiple kids and a dog is remarkable.At 18,000 Pa, the suction is more than twice as strong than most other vacuums at this price point, and the lidar navigation much more accurate. It also has AI-enabled ApexVision and DirtScan to identify obstacles and particularly dirty spots. It did not get lost in a week's worth of testing and I was particularly surprised by how good it was at edging, catching the dust bunnies that tend to pile up in front of my dryer. Also, the dock has a base on it so unlike our previous pick, the Tapo TP-Link RV20 Max ($200), it never gets knocked off the dock and fails to charge. It is almost an inch taller than the RV so it did occasionally get stuck under one of our low sofas. However, despite the need for an occasional rescue, I was startled by the number of flagship features offered at a very affordable price.SpecsNavigation type: LidarSuction: 18,000 PaMultifloor mapping: YesDual-function mop and vac: YesWIRED/TIREDAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWIREDLots of flagship features for an affordable priceHuge dustbinNeat designTIREDTaller than other robot vacuumsGets stuck under sofasBest Self-Emptying Robot VacuumPhotograph: Adrienne SoPhotograph: Adrienne SoChevronChevronEcovacsDeebot X11 Omnicyclone$1,500 Amazon$1,500 Best Buy$1,500 EcovacsEcovacs launched its new flagship Deebot X11 Omnicyclone at IFA 2025 with several standout features. First, it has a bagless waste disposal system, with a canister that cycles debris in a circle to keep it from clogging—you know, like a Dyson vacuum. As someone who has spent many a night on the kitchen floor unclogging the auto-empty tube with a chopstick, I appreciated this. It also has a new fast-charging system with frequent top-ups to prevent long runtime cycles, which I also noticed. Many high-end smart robot vacuums, like the Roborock Saros Z70 below, can take until mid-afternoon to finish running a cleaning cycle in my large house, complete with recharging. The Omnicyclone is usually done by noon.The Omnicyclone has a few other features that I've seen on other vacuums by now, like a climbing driving wheel that gets it out of my fireplace hearth, Matter compatibility, and AI-enabled smarts that switch cleaning modes on different parts of my house. However, I have three small dings against the vacuum. The lid is very sleek-looking, but it falls off and is annoying to replace every time I have to check the roller. Second, the driving wheels sometimes get confused if they're on different surfaces, so I have to tap them to remind them where they are and that they work. And finally, the station lets you switch between the regular cleaning fluid and heavy-duty cleaning fluid for grease or big messes. However, the heavy-duty solution is not searchable on Amazon for some reason. (We reached out to the company and you can find it here.)SpecsNavigation type: Lidar and RGB camerasSuction: 19,500 PaMultifloor mapping: YesDual-function mop and vac: YesWIRED/TIREDAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWIREDBagless, clogless disposal systemFast rechargingSeparate heavy scubbing modeTIREDLid falls off sometimesDriving wheels need tapping occasionallyBest for Pet HairPhotograph: Adrienne SoDreameX50 Ultra$1,600 $1,300 (19% off) Amazon$1,700 $1,200 (29% off) DreameI still really like Dreame's stair-climbing robot vacuum, although I think that bagless, clogless emptying and fast recharging are two practical considerations that make the Ecovacs a better choice. However, this is the best vacuum for pet hair for another reason. Yes, it has double roll brushes to reduce tangling, plus side arms to edge-clean more effectively, in addition to the usual large-capacity docking station with clean and dirty water tanks, self-emptying bag, and hot-water mop washing.But Dreame's software is very impressive. The vacuum's sensors let the AI-enabled app accurately identify obstacles, floor surfaces, and extremely dirty areas—it's the most effective dirt- and obstacle-identification system I've tried. Whenever I skipped a day or two of cleaning, the X50 Ultra reminded me that particular areas of my house had “a high degree of dirtiness” and prompted me to run it again. Anyone who has a pet knows exactly where exactly the areas that have a “high degree of dirtiness” are in your house. (For cat owners, it's probably around the litter box; for me, it's near my dog's bed where she likes to chew up sticks.) It's one of the smartest robot vacuums I've ever tested, outside of the Matic, although I did have to ensure the self-emptying function was working from time to time.SpecsNavigation type: Lidar (no cameras)Suction: 20,000 PaMultifloor mapping: YesDual-function mop and vac: YesWIRED/TIREDAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWIREDBest app that I've triedGoes back to re-clean extra-dirty spots (you know what those are)TIREDNeeds disposal bagsA Robot Vacuum With an ArmPhotograph: Adrienne SoPhotograph: Adrienne SoPhotograph: Adrienne SoChevronChevronRoborockSaros Z70$2,599 $2,000 (23% off) Amazon$2,599 Best Buy$2,599 RoborockThis year at CES 2025, we saw a robot vacuum that can (theoretically) use its Omnigrip extendable arm to pick up your socks and put away your trash. When I set up the Saros Z70, I also designated a shoe storage zone and set up the included Roborock storage box where the robot vacuum would theoretically be able to drop socks, crumpled tissues, and other items.Without the arm, the Saros Z70 is an effective household cleaning companion. The AI-enabled SmartPlan has developed an effective cleaning pattern for my first floor, detaching the mop pads to vacuum before reattaching them to mop my kitchen, laundry, room, and bathroom floors as the final step. It has cleaned up an entire kitchen floor sprinkled with powdered sugar. Battery life is a bit shorter than Saros 10R ($1,600), the version without the robot arm; it runs for about two hours before it needs to recharge. The main problem is that OmniGrip still has a ton of limitations. The vacuum can't pick up clutter beyond a fairly limited assortment of tissues, shoes, socks, or items under 300 grams. It recognizes my flip-flops only if they're on hard surfaces, not carpet, and it fails to bring the shoes back to the shoe storage area. Most days, if I leave clutter out, the vacuum will start out to get it, then note that it has failed to complete sorting and return to the dock. I will continue to run the Saros Z70 this year to see if further software updates make it easier to use, but right now this robot vacuum comes with a pretty big caveat.SpecsNavigation type: LidarSuction: 22,000 PaMultifloor mapping: YesDual-function mop and vac: YesWIRED/TIREDAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWIREDCan entertain visitors with robot armVery dependableDoesn't get stuckTIREDRobot arm takes up space that could've been used for a bigger battery or dustbinArm doesn't always work wellA Combo Robot Vacuum and Stick VacuumCourtesy of YeediPhotograph: Kat MerckChevronChevronYeediC12 Combination Robot Vacuum$600 $400 (33% off) AmazonIt’s a robot vacuum! It’s a stick vacuum! It’s “the world’s first whole house cleaning combot” (combo bot), released with much fanfare by Ecovacs sub-brand Yeedi in September 2024. It’s also the one-stop vacuum solution I didn’t know I needed. Combining a stand-alone robot vacuum with a HEPA-filtered hand vacuum and stick vacuum attachment on one 20 x 20 x 15-inch charging console, this setup leaves its owner with absolutely zero excuse for having a dirty floor.The robot vacuum and its accompanying app are exceedingly user-friendly, having accurately mapped out 835 square feet of vacuumable space on our first floor in about eight minutes. (It can map five separate zones.) However, despite its ability to lift itself about three-quarters of an inch, the robot tended to get tangled in many things during its 85-minute cleaning cycle over the six weeks I tested—cords, rug fringe, a semicircle of loose shoes—necessitating a pre-cleanup each time it was deployed. It also didn’t do the greatest job on deep-pile carpet; I vacuumed up a fairly respectable amount of lint, dirt, and cat hair with an upright vacuum immediately after it was done. It did, however, perform perfectly well on hardwood floors, and its advertised ZeroTangle technology, present on both the robot vac and stick vac, was successful in keeping long hairs from binding up the V-shaped rollers. The hand vac (which comes with brush and crevice nozzles) had similar suction power. While it wasn’t always easy to remove the stick vac attachment, it was sufficient for dispatching small messes like spilled dirt, and I appreciated the LED lights on the front of the stick vac attachment for seeing what needed vacuuming in low light.Both the robot vacuum and hand/stick vacs self-empty into a 1.5-liter clear canister on the console, which has a simple screw-top lid for emptying. The stick vacuum attachment also sports a mop head with a 240 milliliter fluid reservoir, but for some reason, the mop head fits on backward, behind the vacuum head, so it’s awkward to use and difficult to apply even pressure. I used it once and can’t see using it again. It's also not compatible with any smart home systems. However, I still can’t believe how much more I’m vacuuming in general with this system. Even though it takes a fairly significant outlay of space, this system is less expensive and less bulky than buying all three vacuums separately—a no-brainer for most people on a budget. —Kat MerckSpecsNavigation type: LaserSuction: 10,000 PaMultifloor mapping: YesDual-function mop and vac: Sort ofWIRED/TIREDAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWIREDOne-stop cleaning solutionHas a stick vacuum with mopTIREDMop is awkward and doesn't work wellNot compatible with any smart home systemsBest for Small SpacesPhotograph: Adrienne SoEufyRobot Vacuum 3-In-1 E20$650 $349 (46% off) Amazon$550 $350 (36% off) Best Buy$650 EufyThe Eufy E20 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) was one of the most exciting things I saw at CES 2025. It’s three vacuums ingeniously and conveniently housed in one—a robot vacuum whose innards can be clicked out to make a light and maneuverable stick vacuum, as well as a hand vacuum. It all clicks back onto a tiny dock with a self-emptying bin and has an astonishing price, given that robot vacuums with half this functionality retail for almost twice as much.However, the compact size and convenience have some costs. The dustbin is tiny, about half the size of what you might find in other robot vacuums, which necessitates almost constant emptying for my 1,000-square-foot first floor. When it's a stick vacuum, emptying it by hand by rotating the cup is a little gross, and emptying it by sticking it back into the dock is irritating. Also, it only auto empties as a stick vacuum when it's been running for more than 10 minutes at a time, and in my house, I can fill that tiny dustbin in 5 minutes. However, if you have a small house or apartment where you need to save space—or if you don't have multiple dogs and kids filthying your house almost every second of every day—then I highly recommend this. It's adorable, cheap, convenient, and compact.SpecsNavigation type: LidarSuction: 8,000 PaMultifloor mapping: YesDual-function mop and vac: NoWIRED/TIREDAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWIREDIngenious and compactSurprisingly affordableAdorableTIREDDustbin is tinyBest for small homesBest Robot Vacuum and MopPhotograph: WiredYeediM12 Pro+$800 $380 (53% off) AmazonAs we said before, Yeedi is the more affordable sub-brand of Ecovacs, which makes other robot vacuums we like. Like Ecovacs, it has a broad line-up of robot vacuums at different prices. When I first tried Yeedi's vacuums, the navigational software was abysmal, but the company has won my most-improved award since then. WIRED reviewer Ryan Waniata found that the cheaper Yeedi C12 Pro+ ($300) got lost or stuck about 20 percent of the time, but I didn't have problems when I tested this higher-end model.The M12 Pro+ has a few standout qualities. At 4- and 3.5-liter capacities, the clean/dirty water tanks are just ginormous—you won't have to switch them out too often. It has an extendable arm for cleaning out nooks and crannies and a decent 11,000 Pa of suction. It has dropped in price than the Eufy X10 Pro Omni (9/10, WIRED Recommends), which was our original pick here.SpecsNavigation type: LaserSuction: 11,000 PaMultifloor mapping: NoDual-function mop and vac: YesWIRED/TIREDAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWIREDCheapWater tanks are enormousTIREDOne reviewer says it gets stuck sometimes (I haven't experienced this)The Obligatory DysonPhotograph: Chris HaslamCourtesy of DysonChevronChevronDyson360 Vis Nav$1,000 $700 (30% off) Amazon$1,000 Home Depot$1,000 $700 (30% off) DysonNote: Dyson is releasing a new robot vacuum next year, so we recommend holding off on this vacuum if you can.We're including Dyson’s robot vacuum because, given Dyson’s other stellar vacuums, many of you will be considering it. WIRED reviewer Chris Haslam notes that when compared to the original Dyson 360 Heurist, the new robot vacuum is wider, flatter, and considerably more powerful, with a spin speed of 110,000 RPM (up from 78,000). There’s a flashy digital display and a much-improved dustbin removal and emptying system, and the filter is easy to remove and clean. Dyson claims its vacuum has up to six times more suction than the competition.Haslam liked the new “triple-action” brush bar (soft nylon for large debris on hard floors, antistatic carbon-fiber filaments for fine dust, and stiff nylon bristles for carpet), which sweeps right up to the edge of the room. However, its navigation capabilities left something to be desired. On hard floors and in rooms with no obstacles, it managed perfectly, but chair legs and rugs defeated it. A whole host of other brands, including Roomba, Eufy, and Ecovacs, have had no problem in Haslam’s home. If you have a house with an open floor plan and very little furniture, the 360 Vis Nav’s eye-watering price might be worth it. Otherwise, it’s simply not good enough.SpecsNavigation type: CameraSuction: 110,000 rpm (Dyson does not measure in Pa)Multifloor mapping: YesDual-function mop and vac: NoWIRED/TIREDAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWIREDPowerful robot vacuumFilter is easy to remove and clean, and dustbin is easier to remove and empty than past modelsHas a brush bar to sweep edges of the roomTIREDNavigation skills need improvementCompare Top 9 Robot VacuumsModelNavigation TypeSuctionWIREDTIREDRoborock Qrevo SLidar (no cameras)8,000 PaAffordable.

At whatever price you want to pay, you can find a robot vacuum that will look very similar and have similar features. Here are a few that also worked well for us.Roborock Qrevo Curv for $1,099: This was Roborock's 2024 flagship vacuum, and it's still great (reviewer Ryan Waniata calls it the best robot vacuum he's ever used). It has slightly less suction power than this year's Saros 10R, but I did use it to clean an entire carpet full of baking powder. We are waiting for Roborock to release the Qrevo Curv line into the North American market for 2025.Tapo TP-Link RV20 Max for $200: This is a perfectly fine, slim, basic robot vacuum that was our most affordable pick for most of the year. However, I've had it running in my living room for long-term testing and I am becoming a little exasperated by how often it gets knocked off the dock and runs out of battery.Eufy Mach S1 Pro for $950: This astoundingly beautiful robot vacuum will be the centerpiece of your kitchen. The water chamber is see-through and lights up, and an ozone generator purportedly removes up to 99.99 percent of bacteria. It also has ultra-precise navigation and a self-cleaning roller mop that washes itself as it cleans. However, it only has 8,000 Pa suction, which is less than some of our other picks, and at 26.4 inches high, the dock is very tall and makes storage difficult.Eufy X10 Pro Omni for $550: Believe it or not, this is not a bad price for a hybrid robot vacuum mop (9/10, WIRED Recommends) with such fantastic navigational capabilities! (Sales have brought it even lower.) However, the Yeedi above is cheaper and offers mostly the same functionality.Avoid These Robot VacuumsNot every vacuum earns a spot on our list. These are the ones I repacked straightaway.Mova P50 Pro Ultra Robot Vacuum for $799: This robot vacuum features a staggering 19,000 Pa of suction and a wide array of high-end features, like an extendable side brush and an intelligent dirt detection system. Reviewer Molly Higgins appreciated that it's self-cleaning and that the bin auto-empties, but she found that, despite its smart systems, the mapping was not accurate, small obstacles often threw it off, and the vacuum eventually started avoiding rooms altogether.Eufy E28 Combo Robot Vacuum for $983: I was super disappointed by this, since I have two dogs and two kids and frequently need to use a deep carpet cleaner, in addition to a mop and vacuum. This vacuum can mop and has a detachable carpet cleaning station. Unfortunately, the water injection system is wonky. The robot vacuum has to be perfectly positioned to get injected with water from the tank (I often had to tap it into place with my foot), and every time I mopped, it leaked all over my kitchen floor. At least the carpet cleaner was effective.iRobot Combo J7+ for $399: iRobot makes beautiful robot vacuums that I've liked for years, but the software experience on this one was poor when I tested it. Since then, the company has undergone many twists and turns and released a new line under a new CEO. We will update this roundup once we have tested the latest lineup.Ecovacs Deebot T50 Max Pro Omni for $788: My tester could not make it back to the docking station. I have asked Ecovacs for another review sample and will update this once I have tested it.TP-Link Tapo RV30C for $148: I like the simplicity of this robot vacuum, but you can't find replacement bags for it anymore.Eureka J20 and Eureka J15 Pro Ultra for $830: Eureka is a highly respected name in the vacuum field, and these robot vacuums are gorgeous and come with many bells and whistles. However, Eureka vacuums found the tiny lip between the hardwood floor of my kitchen to the carpet of the living room to be completely insurmountable, and the app also forgot the map every time it hit a minor obstacle. It was so annoying.Narwal Freo X Ultra for $700: This is a beautiful vacuum with lots of features, including baseboard dusting. However, despite moving it from room to room to find better Wi-Fi, and switching from phone to phone to try different versions of the app, I was unable to connect it to the app and so could not use it. (I reached out to Narwal multiple times but could not fix it; we will update if I do find a fix in the future.)Switchbot K10+ for $600: You can now accessorize this tiny robot vacuum with additional cleaning accessories, like a stick vacuum or air purifier. Unfortunately, the robot vacuum itself still is horrible. This is the only vacuum where I've ever experienced a pooptastrophe—where it dragged a dog poop all over my house. Reviewer Simon Hill also tried this robot vacuum and discovered that it's suicidal. The roller gets clogged easily, it can't find its way back to the dock, and it often hurls itself down the stairs.Shark PowerDetect 2-in-1 for $1,000: This vacuum cleaned surprisingly well (5/10, WIRED Review). However, it doesn't auto-empty, DirtDetect doesn't work, and the app is completely bonkers (maps aren't accurate, can't add multiple floors, and cleaning times are off).What Navigation System Do I Use?Robot vacuum manufacturers will try to tell you that the most important spec is the level of suction. That is wrong—it's the navigation system. It doesn't matter how good a vacuum is at cleaning if it gets stuck every time it starts. A more complicated or expensive navigation system doesn't guarantee that it won't get stuck, but it is a good starting point. Many vacuums also combine systems.Sensor mapping: The most inexpensive vacuums use a combination of sensors along the exterior of the vacuum, like cliff detectors on the bottom and wall detectors on the bumper, to ping-pong around your home avoiding obstacles.Gyroscope: This is an affordable but surprisingly effective method of mapping that has been used in ships for centuries. A spinning wheel or light helps the vacuum determine its position relative to other objects in your home.Lidar: Lidar stands for “light detection and ranging.” The vacuum uses pulsed lasers to determine how far away each object is.Camera navigation: There's a camera on it. Basically, the vacuum has little eyes that look around. While I've found this system to be extremely accurate and/or unintentionally hilarious, you must look for additional security protocols to make sure that said hilarious images of your home don't end up on the internet.SLAM: With SLAM navigation, or “simultaneous localization and mapping,” the vacuum uses algorithms to process a bunch of data—for example, how many times the wheels have rotated, along with camera or sensor data—to calculate where and how far it should move. It's usually used in combination with a few, or all, of these other navigation technologies.IMU: An inertial measurement unit is a system that combines multiple sensors like gyroscopes and accelerometers to navigate by dead reckoning.Machine learning: Many robot vacuum manufacturers now tout their own proprietary mapping system. For example, iRobot uses a system called Imprint Smart Mapping that learns as it cleans, as does Roborock's SmartPlan. These also usually come in combination with a camera or lasers.Robot Vacuum TipsRobot vacuums have a complicated task. Your home is ever-changing, and no robot vacuum will be perfect. We have a few starting points here, but if you're still having trouble, you should check out our guide to getting the most into your robot vacuum.Do robot vacuums work on hardwood? Yes. Many robot vacuums have different cleaning modes that will allow you to select between carpeting, tile, or other floor surfaces. If you have a combination mop-vacuum, only use the brand's recommended liquid cleaner. Using a generic cleaner may clog your docking station.Will my pet hate my robot vacuum? Maybe. I've introduced three dogs to robot vacuums with minimal problems, but if you're nervous, you can try giving your pets treats when you turn the vacuum on for the first few times.Stay home for your robot vacuum's first few runs. Many homes have hot spots—a weird door jamb, a lumpy rug—where you will need to rescue your vac. Do a quick run-through beforehand for robot booby traps, like ribbons, charging cables, and pieces of string.Check your Wi-Fi. If you have a Wi-Fi-enabled robot vacuum, most of them can only connect to the 2.4-GHz wireless band. If you're having problems connecting, make sure you're linking to the right band. Check out our guide to setting up your smart home for more tips.Vacs need maintenance. Like every robot—especially one that comes in contact with the grimiest parts of your house—you need to care for it regularly. Error messages may prompt you to empty the bin mid-run, cut the hair off the rollers, or wipe off the cliff sensors. Instruction manuals and YouTube can help.Vacuum during the day. If you have the choice, it's usually better to schedule a run at 2 pm than at midnight, since many vacuums also use optical sensors to navigate.Don't throw out your hand vacuum. I hate to be a downer, but you're probably still going to need a full-size manual vacuum once in a while. I keep a Dyson around for quick spot cleaning and vacuuming bedroom corners.Be wary about disposable bags: Some vacuums pull dust into a disposable bag. Instead of dumping out the bin and getting dust everywhere, you just toss the bag out neatly and replace it. Unfortunately, some companies stop selling these bags altogether (looking at you, TP-Link), leaving you with a functioning robot vacuum that can't suck up dust anywhere. Try and find information on how long parts like this will be available.How We TestI've been personally reviewing robot vacuums since 2017 and have tested well more than 100 (I have not tracked the exact number but I have reviewed one roughly every two weeks for eight years). Each WIRED gear tester sets up the vacuum in their own home, according to the manufacturer's instructions, and in a spot with clear Wi-Fi signal. Over the course of at least two weeks, we run the vacuum every day, examining a number of factors: battery life; how well the app works; whether the map is accurate; if it consistently cleans around the edges of your home; and how well it picks up dirt of various sizes, which includes sand, lint, dog hair, Cheerios, wood chips, and flour.We also look for mitigating factors, such as whether it's incredibly loud or ugly, or if it fits into your kitchen at all. For a vacuum to be useful, you have to want to use it and have it around. We also noted a vacuum's power via the manufacturer's stated Pa, or pascals—the higher the number, the greater the suction.Power up with unlimited access to WIRED.
