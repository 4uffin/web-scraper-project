Personally, I have some sort of curse that makes me unable to fall asleep unless I feel the weight of a blanket. That means I usually wake up sweaty and overly hot. A good down comforter feels luxurious, and they come in different weights, which allows you to pick one that can prevent you from getting too hot in the middle of the night. Once you find your ideal comforter—like our top pick, the Premium Quince All-Season for $160—it'll last for years, and it'll help you get the best night's sleep you can.We've spent months testing down comforters—plus a handful of down alternatives—in multiple weights and budget points. Below, you'll find our favorites, with prices referencing the queen size where possible. Check out our other buying guides for tips and recommendations on the Best Sheets, Best Mattresses, and Best Pillows, and a final answer on whether you actually need a duvet cover.Updated September 2025: We’ve added three new comforters from The Company Store. We've also reformatted this guide and checked for accuracy throughout.Table of ContentsAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronCompare Our Top 9 Down ComfortersIs Down Worth It?How Do You Choose a Down Comforter?How Does WIRED Test Down Comforters?More Comforters We've TestedThe Best Down ComforterCourtesy of QuincePhotograph: Louryn StrampeChevronChevronQuincePremium Down Comforter$200 Quince (All-Season)The Quince All-Season has that classic crinkly feeling you associate with a cozy down comforter. It's a little noisy if you shift around in your sleep a lot, but it wasn't loud enough to disturb my partner. It's quite fluffy, with large baffle boxes that stay pretty poofed up if you don't top the comforter with a duvet or another blanket. It has a fill power of 650 and a cotton sateen shell. That makes it feel a bit silkier to the touch than all-cotton comforters might. It's warm but not heavy, and I've used it year-round. After all my testing, this comforter is the one I can't bring myself to take off my bed.Fill power650Shell materialCotton sateenWeight optionsLightweight, All-Season, UltraConstructionBaffle boxSizes availableTwin–kingFill typeResponsible Down Standard-certified white downWIRED/TIREDAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWIREDClassic, crinkly goodnessSilky and warmTIREDShell can be noisy if you shift around a lotDuvet covers or extra blankets limit the fluffinessBest Down Alternative ComforterCourtesy of WayfairWayfair SleepAll-Season Down Alternative Comforter$57 $49 (14% off) Joss & Main$150 $49 (67% off) WayfairThe Wayfair Sleep All-Season with polyester fill is super affordable, and it holds up nearly as well as the middle-of-the-road options you might find in your research. Down alternative might be a better option if you're sensitive to allergens, since it won't trap as much dust and dander as traditional down. It's a bit too lightweight for my tastes, but those in warmer climates may appreciate the cozy feeling without all the weight that some other blankets have.Fill powerUnlistedShell materialMicrofiberWeight optionsAll-SeasonConstructionSewn-throughSizes availableTwin–kingFill typePolyesterWIRED/TIREDAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWIREDSuper affordableLightweightTIREDCould be warmer and heavierBest Sewn-Through UpgradeCourtesy of Feathered FriendsPhotograph: Martin CizmarChevronChevronFeathered FriendsBavarian 700 Down Comforter (Light)$519 Feathered Friends (Light)Feathered Friends specializes in down goods, making everything from expedition-ready sleeping bags that will handle -60 degree Fahrenheit temps (you could sleep at the top of Everest in January) to a travel pillow. The Bavarian 700 down comforter is one of the company’s best-loved and best-reviewed products, and it was easy to see why during my month of testing. Every detail of this piece is well-crafted, and the comforter delivers a rare and precious brand of functional luxury—I’d compare it to a Range Rover, except a Range Rover isn’t as reliable.The base of the duvet is European white goose down with 700-plus fill power, and the package comes with a code to track the source. (My comforter came from Eastern Europe, possibly Moldova or Romania.) The stitching is excellent from edge to edge, little details like the corner ties add comfort, and the lower-profile Bavarian baffles avoid clumpiness. If you’re spending $500 for a queen-size comforter, don’t skimp on the 400-thread-count organic cotton cover, which is perfectly matched to the duvet. —Martin CizmarFill power700Shell materialOrganic cottonWeight optionsSummer, Light, Medium, ArcticConstructionSewn-throughSizes availableTwin–California kingFill typeEastern European white goose downWIRED/TIREDAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWIREDFour warmth levels to choose fromSupremely well-craftedTIREDMight be too warm for some sleepersBest Baffle Box UpgradePhotograph: Kat MerckPhotograph: Kat MerckChevronChevronThe Company StoreLegends Hotel Premium Alberta Down Medium Warmth Comforter$469 $352 (25% off) The Company StoreThe Company Store (formerly the LaCrosse Garment Company, founded in 1911) has specialized in down pillows and comforters since the early 1980s. Some online reviewers claim product quality took a nosedive when Home Depot acquired the brand in 2017, but we didn’t find that to be the case with the brand’s velvet flannel sheets we tried, and I didn’t find fault with the Company Store’s Serene Foam mattress topper, either. With everything I’ve seen from the brand, the Company Store still does old-school luxury right.The RDS-certified, hypoallergenic Legends Hotel Premium Alberta still sports the crisp, fluffy, high-end-hotel feel I remember being wowed by 40 years ago. Like most down comforters, it takes a day or so to fully fluff up, but once it does, it stays that way. I tested the Medium Warmth version for over a month, and felt it was just as warm as the Extra Warm down alternative comforter I usually sleep with. There were no poky feathers or noticeable shifting contents, and I was also a fan of the loops inside each corner, for duvets that come with ties. I also appreciated the oversized 15-inch drop length, so couples sleeping with a queen or king won’t feel like they’re at war. —Kat MerckFill power600-650Shell materialCombed cotton sateen (300 thread count)Weight optionsLight, Medium Warmth, and Extra WarmthConstructionBaffle boxSizes availableTwin–kingFill typeResponsible Down Standard-certified European downWIRED/TIREDAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWIREDLuxuriousWell-constructedOversize drop lengthTIREDMay be too warm for some sleepersBest Colored Down ComforterPhotograph: Garnet HillGarnet HillEssential Down Comforter$299 Garnet HillNot only is this down comforter supremely affordable, but it's also available in a frankly staggering array of 13 different colors. No duvet cover necessary! It looks great on a bed and feels great too, with a silky percale outer shell that crinkles in the best way. It's well constructed and durable, and while it traps heat in, it's not too warm. It might not be the best pick if you want a very fluffy or heavy blanket, but I think it's perfect for the summer months or hot sleepers and that it'd be great in the winter with one more blanket layered on top. You're getting a lot of bang for your buck with this pick.Fill power550Shell materialPercaleWeight optionsOne (midweight)ConstructionSewn-throughSizes availableTwin–kingFill typeResponsible Down Standard-certified downWIRED/TIREDAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWIREDTons of colors to choose fromNot too warmTIREDNot particularly heavy or fluffyBest Value Down ComforterCourtesy of WayfairPhotograph: Molly HigginsChevronChevronCanadian Down & Feather CompanyWhite Goose Feather Duvet$92 $74 (20% off) Amazon$120 $96 (20% off) WayfairThis goose down comforter from Canadian Down & Feather Company feels super expensive without the price to match. It’s a heavier-style comforter, with a down-proof, silky, breathable, 233-thread-count, cotton cover and a satisfying crinkle. It has sewn-through box-stitch construction to ensure the 600-fill-power filling stays uniform and doesn’t shift, and it feels warm but is breathable enough that it doesn’t feel too stifling. The comforter came in a plastic zippered cover for easy storage and transport, and it has a warranty against manufacturing defects. This budget option has an expensive feel and strikes a nice all-weather balance by being heavy and puffy enough to provide warmth, while the light cotton cover provides breathability. —Molly HigginsFill powerUnlistedShell materialCottonWeight optionsAll-SeasonConstructionBaffle boxSizes availableTwin–kingFill typeResponsible Down Standard-certified Goose downWIRED/TIREDAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWIREDNice and heavy without being stiflingIncludes plastic storage bagTIREDNoisySome customers report feathers poking throughFor That Hotel FeelingCourtesy of BrooklinenPhotograph: Louryn StrampeChevronChevronBrooklinenAll-Season Down Comforter$399 $339 (15% off) Brooklinen (All-Season)$399 Amazon (All-Season)This Brooklinen comforter has a hotel-like feel that's soft, crinkly, and starchy. The cotton sateen shell strikes a good balance between silky-feeling and durable, and the internal down is composed of Hutterite clusters (see our advice section, below, for information on the difference between Hutterite and Hungarian down). That basically means the down comes from mature geese, which results in a densely packed composition with even distribution. Basically, no matter how much you shift around, the down will adjust to your body. That prevents the shifting and “pockets” you can get with lower-quality down blankets. You'll always have a layer of goosey goodness between your body and the surrounding air.If you prefer a lot of warmth, opt for the Brooklinen Ultra-Warm Down Comforter ($424). I tested it during a cold snap in northern Illinois, while sleeping in a drafty room next to a window. It was so warm. It was borderline too warm! I’m always piling on extra blankets, and I slept just fine with this as my sole comforter. It has 750 fill power for extra cozy sleep, and the down distribution is fantastic. It’s pricey, but it’ll keep you warm all winter long.Fill power650 to 750 (warmth level dependent)Shell materialCotton sateenWeight optionsLightweight, All-Season, Ultra-WarmConstructionBaffle boxSizes availableTwin–kingFill typeDownmark-certified Hutterite downWIRED/TIREDAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWIREDSoft, crinkly, and starchyDown stays evenly distributedTIREDOuter shell isn't the softestAnother Great Hotel-Like OptionCourtesy of WayfairPhotograph: Molly HigginsChevronChevronAlwyn HomeAll Season Goose Down Comforter$300 $120 (60% off) WayfairThis goose down comforter is thick and sturdy, but the fill is still light, making this a great all-season choice. It has a baffle-box construction, creating pockets of fill so the separation of the feathers are inside the comforter rather than stitched through the layers. This basically ensures that there’s even distribution of the 600-fill-power filling, which also helps with the annoying shifting or bunching that can happen sometimes with down comforters. It's made from 90 percent goose feathers and 10 percent goose down and feels super fluffy and full—just like what you’d expect from a nice hotel comforter.There are four corner tabs and a loop on each side to help easily secure a cover to the comforter insert. The blanket has a subtle stripe pattern, gold satin edges, and a breathable, moisture-wicking cotton cover. It feels thick to the touch and makes a satisfying crinkle noise. The 500-thread-count cotton cover isn’t as soft as I would’ve liked, but overall it strikes a good balance between thickness and breathability. It’s a little warm and may be a better choice for colder weather. Either way, it’s cozy, and I’m excited to keep using it throughout the seasons. —Molly HigginsFill power600Shell materialCottonWeight optionsAll-seasonConstructionBaffle boxSizes availableTwin–California KingFill type10 percent white goose down, 90 white goose featherWIRED/TIREDAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWIREDEven down distributionSubtle, nice-looking patternTIREDOuter shell could be softerMight be too warm for some sleepersA Sturdy OptionCourtesy of L.L.

BeanThis L.L.Bean costs as much as (if not more than) the Feathered Friends above and has far-less-impressive specs: It’s 600-fill down inside a 280 thread count cotton shell instead of 400. But I still like this blanket because of how sturdy it felt in my testing. The shell isn't quite so soft but remains down-proof (meaning no feather tips poking through at you), and each baffled section is just a foot wide, meaning it doesn’t get lumpy. With its light cream color and hefty batch of stuffing, this is a comforter I’d use in an outdoorsy setting like a cabin in the woods. —Martin CizmarFill power600Shell materialCottonWeight optionsWarm, WarmerConstructionBaffle boxSizes availableTwin–kingFill typeWhite goose downWIRED/TIREDAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWIREDSturdy and durableNo lumpsTIREDOverpriced for what you getShell isn't softCompare Our Top 9 Down ComfortersComforterProsConsFill PowerShell MaterialWeight OptionsConstructionSizes AvailableFill TypeQuince Premium Down ComforterClassic, crinkly goodness.

Photograph: BuffyBuffy Breeze Comforter for $200: The Buffy Breeze Comforter has been on my bed for years. It's made with a eucalyptus fiber fill and has a eucalyptus fiber cover, which lends it a silky feeling and excellent temperature regulation. It keeps me warm in the winter, but in the summer it doesn't get too hot or feel too stifling. There are cute duvet covers available that I don't entirely love—the comforter shifts around inside quite a bit—but if you want a duvet cover, this one is decent and made out of similar materials so it won't detract from the comforter's cooling features. The best part is that the Buffy Breeze is pretty affordable, and it goes on sale during basically every shopping holiday.The Company Store Legends Luxury Luxe Royal Down Medium Warmth Comforter for $592: For the price, I admit I was expecting this to be about as high-end a down comforter experience as one could get. And indeed, the RDS-certified Legends Luxury Luxe Royal looks nice, with a silky embossed basketweave design on the cover, but it didn’t have the same loft or fluffy feel as the brand’s Legends Hotel line. Which is strange, as it has a higher fill power than my favorite Legends Hotel comforter, the Premium Alberta (700-750 to Alberta’s 600-650). And it’s not just me—during testing, I lent the Legends Luxury Luxe Royal to my teen son, who had previously been trying the Alberta, and he only made it three days before asking for the Alberta back. —Kat MerckPhotograph: Kat MerckLaCrosse Premium Down Medium Warmth Comforter for $352: From the Company Store’s flagship LaCrosse collection, this RDS-certified comforter hits all the brand's high points: loops for comforters that have ties; 600-650 fill power; combed cotton sateen cover. However, it is around the same price as the Legends Hotel Premium Alberta, above, which is considerably fluffier. —Kat MerckPhotograph: BrooklinenBrooklinen Airweave Cotton Quilt for $254: This fluffy quilt is made of a waffled, textured fabric that feels lightweight, airy, and fluffy but still manages to keep heat in. It's a wonderful blanket for summer months or afternoon naps, and I love the punchy colors. (I tested it in Marigold, a vibrant orange that brings me joy every time I see it.) My tester blanket did have a couple of loose threads, but careful snipping took care of them.Utopia Bedding Down Alternative Comforter for $34: If you’re on a tight budget, this affordable down alternative comforter offers great value for the price. It’s quilted and lightweight, but it’ll still keep you warm despite not being particularly heavy. I wasn’t a huge fan of the outer fabric—it’s microfiber that I found to be a bit scratchy and rough. But the comforter is available in a wide array of colors (there are 11 to choose from), and it has corner loops so it’ll work with a duvet cover. It’s also well-constructed—I didn’t find a single loose thread or stitch, unlike some other affordable comforters I’ve used in the past.Eden & Om Bamboo Comforter
Photograph: Louryn StrampeEden & Om Bamboo Comforter for $149: This blanket is silky-soft and quite thin. It’d be a great option for a summer blanket since it’s naturally cooling, though conversely, you might want to have a warmer comforter around for cooler nights. Even in the Extra weight, it doesn’t completely block the chill from my box fan, let alone keep me warm enough in the brutal winter months. But on nights when it isn’t dreadfully chilly outside, this blanket reminds me of the Buffy Breeze comforter (above)—it helps regulate my body temperature without making me too warm or too cold. It’s also pretty breathable so on the off chance I do sweat, I don’t wake up feeling trapped and overheated.Ikea FJÄLLBRÄCKA for $129: I used this Ikea comforter for several years. It’s not even 100 percent down (they cut it with duck feathers), it tends to get a little lumpy, and it’s not especially lofty, but it does have a 252-thread-count shell that prevents feather leakage. The biggest downside is that the added duck feathers give this comforter a little more of a “poultry smell” than white goose down feathers would. However, this comforter is also machine washable and sturdier than a lot of quilts I’ve used at this price point. —Martin CizmarComforters We Don’t RecommendPhotograph: WayfairWhite Noise Goose Down and Feather All Season Comforter for $72: This all-season medium-weight comforter is breathable, balanced, and suitable for all seasons, with between 2 and 3 inches of 600-fill power thickness. The outside material is soft but feels sort of weird to the touch because it's made of polyester and nylon—although this helps with noise reduction and is quieter than the others I’ve tested. It’s machine washable and struck a great balance between being thin and light enough for warmer weather while having enough thickness to still feel cozy. However, the comforter came with a really weird, pungent odor that smelled like grass and sweat. I washed and dried it two times to make the stench bearable to sleep with, but every once in a while during testing I could still smell the odor faintly. This is a solid all-season down comforter that strikes a good balance and has a great price point. I just wish it hadn’t smelled so gross. —Molly HigginsIs Down Worth It?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronDown is the layer of fluffy feathers between a bird's outer feathers and its skin. It's a great insulating material—just think of all those birds that manage to stay warm and dry all year long. Down is efficient, it's more eco-friendly than some alternative materials, and it's breathable despite keeping things so warm. Down holds up well over time with proper care, so your initial investment will last for years. A down comforter is especially worthwhile if you live in a cold climate. Blankets made with down alternatives or other types of materials can be good, too, but if you're looking for a warm blanket that'll last decades, down is probably what you want. We have an article dedicated to helping you decide.How Do You Choose a Down Comforter?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronLook for a cover thread count between 230 and 500. Fabrics with these thread counts are “down-proof” and minimize the chances of feathers poking through.Fill power vs. fill weight: Fill power is a measurement of how much space, in cubic inches, an ounce of down takes up—for instance, a fill power of 600 means one ounce of down will take up 600 cubic inches. A higher fill power means fluffier, more efficient down. Fill power doesn't necessarily translate to warmth, but it's an indication of the quality of the down and how much the down compresses. Fill weight, on the other hand, is the amount of down inside the product. If something has high fill power but low fill weight, it won't necessarily be warmer than if something has low fill power and high fill weight. It's a little confusing. The most important factor is how the down is distributed. Look for baffle-box or sewn-through construction in your comforters for an indication that down will be distributed evenly and keep you warm throughout the night. Baffle boxes keep down lofty but need to be shaken sometimes to reallocate the down inside, whereas sewn-through keeps things in place but often results in a slightly less fluffy comforter.Goose vs. duck down: Goose down has a higher fill power than duck down, so it's fluffier and loftier. It's also less smelly and generally more hypoallergenic. On the other hand, duck down is usually more affordable. We think goose down is best unless you're on a very tight budget. Two common types of goose down are Hungarian and Hutterite. Both are considered to be top-notch based on the large down clusters typical of birds that come from the cold regions of Hungary and Canada. Hutterite tends to be more affordable. You likely wouldn't be able to tell the difference between the two. Hungarian down can be a bit loftier, and Hutterite down can be a bit softer, but ultimately neither of these factors should make or break your decision to purchase a comforter. When it comes to the types of birds the down comes from, however, you should look for all goose down or at least a blend of goose and duck. That will cut back on odors and allergens and offer a fluffier, more high-quality blanket.Down comforter care tips: If you're investing in a comforter, you might want to consider getting a duvet cover, which can help protect the comforter and also usually improves the look (unless you're into plain white). When it comes to washing the comforter itself, you want to follow the instructions on the care tag, and wash it as infrequently as you can. You can do it at home if your washer is big enough; otherwise, head to local laundromat to use their bigger machines. Use a delicate wash cycle with high spin speed to get as much moisture out as possible, and avoid using fabric softener, which can degrade the down's fluffy texture. You should also use a small amount of detergent—err on the side of less, not more—and consider an extra rinse cycle to ensure that all the soap is rinsed out. Make sure that your comforter is fully dry using a low-heat setting. It might take a few cycles. Fluff the comforter between rounds to ensure efficient drying and maximum loft. I like using wool dryer balls to help make drying more efficient.How Does WIRED Test Down Comforters?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronFor each comforter we tested, our testers slept with our respective picks for at least seven nights in locations around the US—our testers included folks living in Portland, Oregon; northern Illinois; New York City; and Kansas City, Missouri. Every comforter in this list has at least been tested during autumn, though most have been tested during every season. We looked for comforters that struck a balance between price, efficiency, and quality, and sought out different fill weights, fill powers, and materials to ensure our recommendations met a variety of reader needs. We assessed how we felt as we fell asleep, slept, and woke up. We paid careful attention to details such as whether a comforter was noisy while settling in for the night, or whether any feathers poked through.Power up with unlimited access to WIRED.
