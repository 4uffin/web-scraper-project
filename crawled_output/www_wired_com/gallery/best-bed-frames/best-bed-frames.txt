There comes a pivotal time in every adult’s life when they finally upgrade from hand-me-downs. A bed frame might seem like something you can go without, but not only can they upgrade the look of your room and benefit your sleep hygiene, they can also help your mattress last longer. The prices listed are for queen-size beds.Be sure to check out our other sleep guides, including the Best Mattresses, Best Organic Mattresses, Best Japanese Joinery Bed Frames, Best Bedsheets, and Best Sleep Gadgets for more. And if you don't want to upgrade your frame just yet, check out this advice on how to fix bed frame problems.Updated September 2025: We've added new frames from DreamCloud and Silk & Snow. We reformatted this guide and ensured accuracy throughout.Table of ContentsAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronCompare Our Top 13 Bed FramesHow Does WIRED Test Bed Frames?How Are Bed Frames Delivered?Best OverallCourtesy of ThumaThumaClassic Bed Frame$1,195 Thuma$1,995 Thuma (With Headboard)I've owned Thuma’s Classic Bed for four years, and it feels as good as new. You don't need a single tool to assemble this wooden bed frame. The company uses traditional Japanese joinery techniques, and it took me about 15 minutes to put the whole thing together. That means disassembly and reassembly when I had to move was so easy—there are but two thumb screws at the top and bottom edges of the frame, which you can hand-screw in once everything else is in place.More surprising is how sturdy it is. I've gone through so many bed frames before the Thuma, and after a year or two, there's usually a broken slat or bent metal rod here and there. Or the slats keep falling down, so you have to do that thing where you pull the mattress over your head as you try to shove them back in place (just me?). The Thuma doesn't creak and never slides around. The foam Pillowboard is an additional expense, but it's comfy. Thuma has since added a wood headboard, which is pricier, but that's what I'll probably upgrade to next, since it completes the look. A part of the problem is how expensive this whole bed frame is (the price has jumped since I first purchased it), but if it helps, the Thuma is made from repurposed wood, and it's UL GreenGuard Gold Certified, meeting low chemical emissions. —Julian ChokkattuAvailable Finishes4Materials UsedUpcycled wood.

Trust me, we don’t want my clumsiness around sharp objects. Not all bed frames that follow this blueprint are of the same caliber, with some being far more stable than others. DreamCloud's bamboo Japanese joinery bed frame wasn’t just gorgeous, but outfitted with small details that make a big impact. This includes tiny additional rods on each of the boards, located where they are stacked atop each other at the ends. The idea is to keep each of the rails that make up the frame even more secure than just the tension of the overall design. There are included foam blocks if decide to throw in a headboard, so there's no banging against the wall, either. Plus, I’ll never argue with the price tag, which is very within my budget. —Julia ForbesAvailable Finishes2Materials UsedBamboo frame.

It's as simple as simple gets, but the steel construction means the frame is durable, and you don't need to bring your own box spring. The 18-inch model leaves a cavernous space beneath the bed that can accommodate several tote-style storage containers—which could be a blessing or a curse depending on the usual state of your bedroom floor. Just keep in mind that there is no edge whatsoever. This thing is basically a table for your mattress.Available Finishes1Materials UsedMetalWeight Capacity350 pounds (twin). 700 pounds (full, queen, king).Sizes AvailableTwin–kingWarranty1 yearWIRED/TIREDAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWIREDSimple setupRoom for storage underneathTIREDVery basicNo edge supportBest Metal Bed Frame for MovingCourtesy of AmazonZinusAbel Metal Platform$105 $93 (11% off) Amazon$93 Walmart$101 The Home DepotAfter years of building Ikea bed frames that were never the same after I broke them down for a move, I switched to the Zinus Abel Metal Platform Bed. There’s a lot I love about this bed frame that I’ve dragged to three different apartments in Southern California: It breaks down into a pile of metal rods (plus the two rectangle end pieces that don’t come apart), making it super easy to move, and it’s just as sturdy after rebuilding it multiple times. The only thing that didn’t survive the moves was the double-sided tape that held my mattress in place, but I don’t mind pushing the mattress back occasionally. It’s also high enough to have plenty of storage underneath—or cat tunnels, in my case. —Nena FarrellAvailable Finishes1Materials UsedSteelWeight Capacity350 pounds (twin). 700 pounds (full, queen, king).Sizes AvailableTwin–kingWarranty5 yearsWIRED/TIREDAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWIREDEasy to moveSturdyRoom for storageTIREDMattress shifts aroundBest Simple and Cheap Wooden FrameCourtesy of KD FramesKD FramesNomad Platform Bed$299 Amazon$299 $279 (7% off) KD FramesIf you don't like the metal frames from Zinus or AmazonBasics, this might be up your alley. I've put together two Nomad beds from KD Frames, and I know I've got a few more in me. This simple, sturdy bed frame is made in Athens, Georgia, from tulip poplar. Tulip poplar looks like pine, but it's hardwood, and the twin size of this bed can support 600 pounds. The Nomad has clean lines and comes unfinished, meaning you can easily stain it to fit your other furniture. Best of all, it costs about $200 and can be set up in about 20 minutes. —Martin CizmarAvailable Finishes1Materials UsedUnfinished tulip poplar hardwoodWeight Capacity700 poundsSizes AvailableTwin–California kingWarranty5 yearsWIRED/TIREDAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWIREDEasy to set upVery affordableTIREDComes unfinished (stain it yourself)Best Platform Bed FrameCourtesy of AwaraAwaraPlatform Bed$359 AwaraIf you prefer the look of fabric covers, the Awara Platform Bed will be a good fit. It's simple to assemble, and the pieces are easy to move. The spruce slats are all attached together, so once you have the four frame pieces assembled, simply roll the slats out and they'll attach via hook-and-loop closures to the frame itself. The frame's height is nice too. It's elevated just enough to make your bed look refined, but not so much that you'll end up losing things underneath your mattress. Though be aware, I did seem to stub my toes on this bed frame more than others I've tested.Available Finishes1Materials UsedSpruce.

The padded fabric headboard and footboard are sturdy, and the slats are supportive. They're also part of the frame itself, not attached separately. The result is a completely silent platform for your mattress.This does make assembly less intuitive than the other bed frames in this guide—it took some trial and error for my partner and I to figure it out. A word of caution: Make sure you have plenty of room to walk around the bed. The corners jut out at the perfect height for you to bang your knee or shins into them. I've got the bruises to prove it. (Some corner protectors might help.) It's also a relatively deep platform, but fixing the sheets was easy with this Zlumber Jack. Overall, though, the bed frame is solid, quiet, and sturdy.Available Finishes1Materials UsedWood, linenWeight Capacity600 poundsSizes AvailableFull, king, California kingWarrantyLifetime warrantyWIRED/TIREDAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWIREDGorgeousCompletely silentTIREDAssembly takes some patienceBeware stubbed shinsBest Adjustable Bed FrameCourtesy of Molly HigginsSaatvaAdjustable Base$1,245 $945 (24% off) SaatvaThis adjustable base is from the makers of one of our favorite mattresses overall and one of our favorite mattresses for side sleepers. It runs on electricity to move the hydraulic-like motors below, which raise both the head and foot area of the bed. It comes with a wireless Bluetooth-enabled remote with buttons to adjust the head and foot portion of the bed up and down, a built-in flashlight, and a button to bring the frame down to a flat level.The Legget & Platt app can act as a remote as well—a huge sigh of relief for a generally scatterbrained person like myself who's prone to losing things. In the app, you name your bed, make the same adjustments, and save your favorite positions so you can easily go back to them. The bed frame is sleek—not bulky at all—and is around 13 inches off the ground, making extra storage space underneath that I didn’t have before. The legs are virtually invisible, although the zero-clearance design allows the base to be used without the legs if using platform bases.The adjustable frame rises in half-inch increments from 13 to 18 inches from the original base, and the motor is fairly quiet. The base works with mattresses designed to flex, without shifting inside materials or weakening the structure, and is compatible with nearly all Saatva mattresses. For non-Saatva mattresses, check with the manufacturer to ensure it's compatible with an adjustable base.Saatva provides a 10-year warranty as well as free in-room delivery and setup, and the men were done in less than 15 minutes, even putting my old mattress back on for me. I often work in my bed and use pillows to prop me up, and this took away the need to be surrounded by a dozen or so of my favorite body pillows. This customizable frame would work great for those with mobility issues or health issues like acid reflux, restless leg syndrome, sleep apnea, or sciatica (among other things). This bougie bed base isn’t completely necessary for me, but it’s a fun luxury to have. —Molly HigginsAvailable Finishes1Materials UsedSteel, plywoodWeight Capacity850 poundsSizes AvailableTwin XL–California kingWarranty10 yearsWIRED/TIREDAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWIREDAdjustableApp controls (plus a dedicated remote)TIREDNo returnsBest Bed Frame With Lift-Up StorageCourtesy of CastleryCastleryAuburn Performance Bouclé Storage Bed$1,799 CastelryIf your bedroom needs decluttering, the Auburn is a splurge but a worthwhile investment in your mental well-being. Covered in Castlery’s spill-resistant bouclé fabric, the Auburn proves surprisingly durable against my cats, who treat my furniture like their personal playground. Although I was initially worried about the creamy white—a shade most pet owners might avoid—it has remained pristine after a month. Aesthetically, I adore the wingback headboard and low-profile design. The dense-looped Cambria textile is soft without being overly delicate.Though my favorite feature is the lift-up storage compartment, ideal for my 700-ish-square-foot apartment. It’s not tall enough for full-size suitcases, but it accommodates all the random items that typically lack a designated spot—duffels, Christmas ornaments, a cat stroller, etc. Castlery offers white-glove delivery, provided the bedroom is ready. Assembly is doable alone, but it’s easier with two people. —Boutayna ChokraneAvailable Finishes1Materials UsedPlywood, engineered wood, PU foam and fiber, non-woven fabricWeight Capacity600 poundsSizes AvailableQueen, KingWarranty3 years (frame). 1 year (foam and fabric.)WIRED/TIREDAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWIREDGorgeousDurable fabricBuilt-in storageTIREDAssembly takes some patienceA Bed Frame With Drawer StorageCourtesy of Silk & SnowSilk & SnowBed Frame With Storage$700 $595 (15% off) Silk & SnowI don't say this lightly or often, but I feel like Silk & Snow could charge much more for this Oeko-Tex-certified bed frame. Assembly was annoying—give me video instructions or give me death!—and slightly fiddly, with many individual pieces that you need to screw in or slot together. But the frame is sturdy, the upholstered fabric is soft and durable, and the slats are nice and supportive. The best feature is the built-in storage drawer, which slides out smoothly and closes tightly with magnets. It strikes the perfect balance of form and function.It doesn't have as much storage space as the lift-up option we recommend from Castlery in this guide, but there's room for spare linens, off-season clothing, or certain unmentionables that you don't want just lying around out in the open. Be aware that closing the drawer while your bedmate is sleeping will absolutely jolt them awake. But overall, this affordable bed frame offers a good mix of pleasant aesthetics and practical storage solutions.Available Finishes3Materials UsedWood legs. Iron and engineered wood frame.

The solid wood design and Japanese joinery method together is, in a word, stunning. I received the cortado acacia wood frame for testing, which like the name, resembled the lovely, rich hue of my preferred morning coffee. Be careful, as I did find that it scuffed easily with continued use and solo setup and disassembling. To prevent that, you’ll want to grab someone to help you. But overall, it didn’t wobble, the internal slats were held neatly in place, and I nearly cried when I had to donate it because it was just so dang pretty. —Julia ForbesAvailable FinishesTwo wood and 4 fabric, plus a rattan headboard optionMaterials UsedAcacia and Rubberwood.

The Signature was launched in February as the brand's first fully upholstered bed. The Thuma Signature has the same Japanese wood joinery at its heart but covers the frame in soft Italian felted wool or performance linen for a decidedly more posh experience. I've been testing the wool version for a few months. It took less than five minutes for me to assemble, and it's very solid and dead silent, with no squeaking whatsoever. The plush headboard is pillow-soft, and my only problem with it is remembering not to just lay my head directly on it. Best of all, when it's time to move, this bed will pop apart in just a few minutes without any bolts or screws. —Martin CizmarAvailable Finishes8Materials UsedWood. Felt.

The design is not quite as elegant as the Thuma, but the result is similar: You can take this bed apart or put it back together in less than 10 minutes with no tools. That's thanks to a system where metal hooks and latches are affixed to the corners of each part of the frame. Put the hooks into the latches, then just roll the slats out on top and you're done. The ease of assembly is impressive even next to the Ikea beds I've put together, but the frame feels a lot sturdier. —Martin CizmarAvailable Finishes3Materials UsedAsh woodWeight Capacity600 poundsSizes AvailableTwin–California kingWarranty5 yearsWIRED/TIREDAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWIREDEasy, tool-free setupSturdyTIREDDesign could be more elegantCompare Our Top 13 Bed FramesBed FrameProsConsAvailable FinishesMaterials UsedWeight CapacitySizes AvailableWarrantyThuma Classic Bed FrameDurable.

We assembled them ourselves when possible, and we slept on them over the course of weeks, if not months or years. (The minimum time for consideration was one week.) We looked for frames that were durable and worth their cost, taking into account unique features, ease of assembly, solid construction, and no problems that needed solving. Many of these frames are being kept around our homes for long-term durability testing. Frames that aren't kept for long-term testing are donated.How Are Bed Frames Delivered?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronSome of these frames have the option of white glove delivery, where nice folks will come and deliver your bed frame already set up, and then remove the packaging. Sometimes they'll even take your old one (and sometimes that comes with an upcharge.) White glove delivery is nice, but note that you'll need to make sure the area is completely clear so the delivery folks have room to maneuver around.If you choose to assemble the bed frame yourself, most of the time any tools that are required are included. You might need (or want) to provide your own screwdriver, and you can also expect to use an Allen wrench or a small wrench to tighten down fasteners. Assembly is almost always easier with two people, but it's achievable with one. Be prepared to put out a lot of recycling—there's usually an abundance of cardboard, styrofoam, and other packing material. And if you're pairing your new frame with a new mattress, we have tips on assembly there too.Power up with unlimited access to WIRED.
