You'd think somewhere in the miraculous technological utopia of our age, we'd also be able to get decently cheap laptops. Not so long ago, that felt like a hopeless case. These days, you might be surprised by just how good budget laptops have become. Chromebooks have become modernized, budget Windows laptops now have good battery life, and there's even a MacBook that's affordable enough for the “cheap” designation. If your budget is tight, these are our favorite budget laptops, most of which are under $650.For more laptop recommendations, be sure to check out our other computing guides, including the Best Laptops, Best Chromebooks, Best Linux Laptops, Best Gaming Laptops, and Best MacBooks.

Poor performance and battery life were the biggest detriments, but the Asus Vivobook 14 (6/10, WIRED Review) completely changes that equation with its use of the Qualcomm Snapdragon X chip. It'll easily give you a full day of battery life and will handle with ease most tasks you throw at it. On top of that, you get a whopping 16 GB of RAM and 512 GB of storage. For $650, that's a steal.Like all budget laptops, the Asus Vivobook 14 has its compromises. The display is lackluster, which is its primary deficiency. It's fine, but the colors are off, and I wish it were brighter. And no, it's not the prettiest laptop in the world. But for the price, you won't find a better Windows laptop.SpecsDisplay: 14-inch, 1920 x 1200CPU: Qualcomm Snapdragon XRAM: 16 GBStorage: 512 GBWIRED/TIREDAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWIREDGreat specs for the pricePlenty of memory and storageLong-lasting battery lifeTIREDLackluster screenDull designAnother Great Cheap LaptopPhotograph: AsusAsusZenbook 14 OLED (2024)$639 Amazon (Intel)$1,050 Asus (AMD)Asus' Zenbook 14 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) offers good performance, great battery life, and an OLED display—all for a little over $1,000. Now, you might think that sounds a little expensive to be considered a “cheap laptop." And it is. But Asus also sells a much cheaper, Intel-powered model called the Zenbook 14 Q415. It's selling for around $600, if you can believe it, as it's a couple of years old. That model comes with less memory but otherwise offers the same portability, port selection, and comfortable keyboard.The more recent AMD-powered model that we tested, however, comes with the AMD Ryzen 7 8840HS with 16 GB of RAM and a 512-GB SSD. We were impressed with the performance, especially given the price, though the fan can get loud. Graphics and gaming aren’t entirely workable, with rather pitiful frame rates throughout, but battery life is outstanding, clocking in at 15 hours (measured by looping a YouTube video at full brightness).SpecsDisplay: 14-inch, 1920 x 1200CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 8840HSRAM: 16 GBStorage: 512 GBWIRED/TIREDAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWIREDCompact, portable designKeyboard is comfortable, preciseLong-lasting battery lifeTIREDAMD model is expensiveOnly 8 GB of RAMThe Best ChromebookPhotograph: Luke LarsenPhotograph: Luke LarsenPhotograph: Luke LarsenChevronChevronLenovoChromebook Plus 14$749 Best Buy$749 B&H$650 Lenovo (12 GB)Sometimes it can be difficult to justify Chromebooks over $500 due to their software limitations. But in hardware, the Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) makes a serious case for a Chromebook at its price, which starts at $650. While our top pick for best cheap laptop, the Asus Vivobook 14, has broader appeal because it's a Windows device, the Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 is an undeniably more enjoyable piece of tech to use.It's better in many ways, including its display, chassis, keyboard, and touchpad. It has close to the same battery life, lasting up to 16 hours in video playback, which is the best battery life I've ever seen on a Chromebook and is right up there with its Mac and Windows rivals. Yes, there are limitations with ChromeOS to consider, but the Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 is a winner for tight wallets.Note: Lenovo's 12 GB version of this Chromebook is sold exclusively at Lenovo.com, and it is often sold out.SpecsDisplay: 14-inch, 1920 x 1200CPU: MediaTek Kompanio Ultra 910RAM: 12 GBStorage: 256 GBWIRED/TIREDAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWIREDVibrant OLED screenFull-bodied speakersLoads of RAMImpressive performanceComfortable keyboard and touchpadTIREDMinimal portsTakes two hands to openBest Cheap MacBookCourtesy of AppleAppleMacBook Air (M1, 2020)$649 $599 (8% off) Walmart$373 Amazon (Renewed)We don't normally recommend 5-year-old laptops, nor do we usually recommend cheap Apple products. The M1 MacBook Air (9/10, WIRED Recommends) from 2020, however, is a rare exception. While it has been superseded by a bevy of more recent Airs, it remains a powerful laptop for the money. Our model is still going strong despite daily use. The battery is in good shape too (surprisingly), still allowing for a full day's work. The one downside is that you can only buy the base model with 8 GB of unified memory and 256 GB of storage. That's fine for basic things like web browsing and document editing, but if you're looking to push it, you'll likely hit some slowdowns. It also has a sharper and more colorful screen than almost any other laptop on this list.Make sure you pay no more than $600—we've seen newer M3-powered MacBooks go for as low as $849, or M2-powered MacBooks dip to $750, so it might be worth saving for something more modern.Rumor has it that Apple may soon launch a new $600 MacBook that replaces the M1 MacBook Air, powered by the A18 iPhone chip. It might be prudent to wait another month or two. Otherwise, the M1 MacBook Air is the best cheap MacBook you can buy right now.SpecsDisplay: 13.3-inch, 2560 x 1600CPU: Apple M1RAM: 8 GBStorage: 256 GBWIRED/TIREDAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWIREDA killer dealStill fairly thin and lightSurprisingly good battery life and performanceWorld-class keyboard and touchpadTIREDUses the old MacBook Air chassisThick bezelsLimited external display supportA Long-Lasting, Upgradeable LaptopPhotograph: Luke LarsenPhotograph: Luke LarsenPhotograph: Luke LarsenPhotograph: Luke LarsenChevronChevronFrameworkLaptop 12$549 FrameworkMost cheap laptops won't last you too long. They're a holdover laptop to get you to something faster and more premium-feeling. Not the Framework Laptop 12 (7/10, WIRED Recommends). Like other Framework computers, the Laptop 12 is completely upgradable, allowing you to access and swap out nearly every internal component. So long as Framework continues to hold up its end of the deal, you could upgrade the Framework Laptop 12 over the years and keep it around through many generations of CPUs. The amazing part is just how easy Framework has made it to install components and upgrade them yourself—it can be done in minutes.The DIY Edition, which doesn't come with RAM and storage, starts at just $549. While the performance and display aren't exactly premium, I was surprised by how high-end the touchpad and keyboard feel. If you want something affordable (and highly customizable) that you want to last more than a few years, this is it.SpecsDisplay: 12.2-inch, 1920 x 1200CPU: Intel Core i3-1315URAM: Not includedStorage: Not includedWIRED/TIREDAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWIREDEven easier to upgrade yourselfSurprisingly high-end keyboard and touchpadFun colors and designGreat priceTIREDAbsurdly large bezelsThick and heavy for the sizeNot very fastBest $500 LaptopCourtesy of LenovoLenovoFlex 5i Chromebook Plus$485 Amazon$599 $549 (8% off) Best Buy$499 LenovoChromebooks have a reputation for being underpowered. To change that, Google launched Chromebook Plus in 2023, an umbrella category for a new class of devices from various manufacturers. The “Plus” stands for better performance—faster processors, more memory, more storage, and better video cameras. One of my favorites is Lenovo's Flex 5i Chromebook Plus (8/10, WIRED Recommends). It's among the fastest Chromebooks we've tested at this price, featuring an Intel Core i3-1315U CPU, 8 GB of RAM, and 128 GB of flash storage.The Flex 5i has two USB-C ports (one is used for charging) plus one USB-A port. You also get a microSD card slot for expanding the storage capability, making this a good choice for those who don't want to keep everything in the cloud. The 14-inch touchscreen uses a 2-in-1 design, making it ideal for media streaming. As on most Chromebooks, the screen isn't the best, with mid-level brightness and a standard 1,920 x 1,080-pixel screen resolution.There are plenty of other great Chromebook Plus models, so make sure you read our Best Chromebooks guide for more cheap laptops.SpecsDisplay: 14-inch, 1920 x 1200CPU: Intel Core i3-1315URAM: 8 GBStorage: 128 GBWIRED/TIREDAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWIREDTop-notch valueSolid IPS displayGood specs for a ChromebookDecent battery lifeTIREDToo thickNo HDMI portBest Windows Laptop Under $500Photograph: Dan Thorp-LancasterAcerAspire Go 14$310 Amazon (15-Inch)The Acer Aspire Go 14 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) won’t win any style or performance awards, but it holds up well as an incredibly affordable Windows laptop. The one major thing it has going for it is fantastic battery life. I was able to hit upwards of 14 hours on a charge, which could make this a great budget option for students who need something that’ll last a whole day on campus.The Aspire Go 14 comes in two low-power processor flavors, with your choice of an AMD Ryzen 3 7320 CPU or an Intel Core i3 N-series. Either way, you’ll get basic tasks like browsing and writing done with ease. Just keep in mind this is a $300 laptop (occasionally less on sale), so the screen quality, sound, and webcam are far from great.SpecsDisplay: 13.3-inch, 2560 x 1600CPU: AMD Ryzen 3 7320RAM: 8 GBStorage: 128 GBWIRED/TIREDAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWIREDLong battery lifeFantastic priceTIREDNot so great screenUses low-powered CPUsDoesn't come with much storageBest Laptop Under $300Photograph: Luke LarsenAsusChromebook CX15$220 $159 (28% off) Walmart (4 GB)$270 AmazonYou shouldn't buy a Windows laptop under $300. Don't even bother. The good news is that some solid Chromebooks come in under $300, which increasingly have good specs. The Acer Chromebook CX14 is the best example of this trend. Despite costing under $300, this 15-inch Chromebook comes with 8 GB of RAM and 128 GB of storage. The 15-inch screen goes up to 300 nits of brightness, and even though the colors are a bit off, it's a 1080p resolution. The Intel Celeron CPU inside won't blow you away, but for the price, it certainly gets the job done.There's also the Asus Chromebook CX14 (6/10, WIRED Review), a 14-inch version of this same laptop, which has a slightly sharper screen and an overall smaller chassis.SpecsDisplay: 15.6-inch, 1920 x 1080CPU: Intel Celeron N4500RAM: 8 GBStorage: 128 GBWIRED/TIREDAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWIREDPlayful designSolid battery lifeLarge screenLots of portsTIREDColors of display are offClunky touchpadBest Cheap 16-inch LaptopPhotograph: Luke LarsenPhotograph: Luke LarsenPhotograph: Luke LarsenPhotograph: Luke LarsenChevronChevronLenovoIdeaPad 5i 2-in-1 (16-Inch, Intel)$680 Lenovo16-inch laptops tend to be more expensive than smaller options, making them hard to find under a certain price. The Lenovo IdeaPad 5i 2-in-1 (6/10, WIRED Review) is a 16-inch laptop that manages to squeeze out just enough quality to make it worth the price. While the display has typical deficiencies (such as poor color coverage), I do appreciate that it doesn't have a matte finish, which brings out more clarity in the panel. A larger screen means less pixel density, yes, but if you need a larger screen at a low price, the IdeaPad 5i 2-in-1 is your best bet.Beyond the screen, I also thought the keyboard was tiresome to type on. But I was impressed by the sturdy build quality of this laptop, as well as the inclusion of the touchscreen and 360-degree hinge.SpecsDisplay: 16-inch, 1920 x 1200CPU: Up to Core Ultra 7 255URAM: Up to 32 GBStorage: Up to 1 TBWIRED/TIREDAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWIREDGlossy screen, which is uncommon, but looks nicerGood-enough CPU performanceSolid 1080p webcamWell-builtTouchscreen and 360-degree hingeTIREDPoor displayKeyboard is tiresome to type onBoring designThick and heavyBest Cheap Gaming LaptopCourtesy of AcerAcerNitro 17 (2024, AMD)$1,295 AmazonCheap gaming laptops are hard to come by, especially ones that are worth buying. Finding a gaming laptop under (or around) $1,000 is almost impossible, especially one with decent performance. One exception is the Acer Nitro 17 (8/10, WIRED Recommends). It certainly isn’t the flashiest laptop in the world, but the RTX 4060 gives it plenty of power for its price. The trade-off is the huge 17-inch screen, making for one of the most oversized, heavy laptops we've tested (it weighs 6.3 pounds). But for cheap gaming laptops, performance is paramount, which makes the Acer Nitro 17 the best cheap gaming laptop you can buy.SpecsDisplay: 17.3-inch, 1920 x 1080CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 8845HS, RTX 4060RAM: 16 GBStorage: 1 TBWIRED/TIREDAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWIREDGood performance for the priceTons of portsResponsive keyboardTIREDOld-school 16:9 displayThick and heavyPoor battery lifeBest Cheap 2-in-1 LaptopPhotograph: Daniel Thorp-LancasterLenovoChromebook Duet Gen 9 (11 Inch, MediaTek)$320 $288 (10% off) Amazon$368 Amazon (8 GB)$379 LenovoLenovo’s Chromebook Duet Gen 9 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) quickly became one of my favorite gadgets of 2024 despite its small size. That’s the whole point with this 11-inch detachable laptop, which is incredibly fun to use around the house and throw in a bag when it’s time to go. The keyboard detaches from the screen, so it makes for a nice tablet when paired with ChromeOS's Android apps, and then you can get some work done when you attach the keyboard. At nearly 10 hours on average, its battery life will easily get you through the day, too.It's powered by a battery-sipping MediaTek Kompanio 838 processor that can handle more than 10 Chrome tabs open at a time. The small keyboard and trackpad require an adjustment if you’re coming from a full-size keyboard, but they’re also what help it stay portable. The included Lenovo Pen is great as well for signing documents or doodling, and you can easily dock it out of the way on the back of the display when you don’t need it.SpecsDisplay: 10.9-inch, 1920 x 1200CPU: MediaTek Kompanio 838RAM: 4 GBStorage: 64 GBA Super-Thin ChromebookPhotograph: Daniel Thorp-LancasterSamsungGalaxy Chromebook Plus$750 Best Buy$700 SamsungCheap laptops tend to skimp on the display. Not the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus (8/10, WIRED Recommends). It sports a 15.6-inch AMOLED screen, the same type you'll find on all sorts of premium Windows laptops. It looks fantastic, with vivid colors and details—a huge step up from almost every other laptop at this price.Beyond just the display, it's also just 0.47 inches thick and 2.58 pounds. That’s less than half an inch, making it the thinnest and lightest Chromebook Plus you can get right now. The Intel Core i3-100U processor, meanwhile, handles ChromeOS with ease. This is also one of the few Chromebooks with Google’s Quick Insert key, which gives you easy access to shortcuts for accessing GIFs and emoji, a list of recently opened websites, AI tools, and integrated Google Drive search, among other things.SpecsDisplay: 15.6-inch, 1920 x 1080CPU: Intel Core 3 100URAM: 8 GBStorage: 256 GBWIRED/TIREDAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWIREDThin, light, and modernAMOLED display is vibrantFast and long-lastingTIRED16:9 aspect ratio feels old-schoolNo touchscreenCompare Top 12 Budget LaptopsOSScreen SizeResolutionCPURAMStorageAsus Vivobook 14 (X1407QA)Windows14 inches1,920 x 1,200Qualcomm Snapdragon X16 GB512 GBAsus Zenbook 14 OLED (2024)Windows14 inches1,920 x 1,200AMD Ryzen 7 8840HS16 GB512 GBLenovo Chromebook Plus 14Chrome OS14 inches1,920 x 1,200MediaTek Kompanio Ultra 91012 GB256 GBApple MacBook Air (2020)macOS13.3 inches2,560 x 1,600Apple M18 GB256 GBLenovo Flex 5i ChromebookChrome OS14 inches1,920 x 1,200Intel Core i3-1315U8 GB128 GBAcer Aspire Go 14Windows13.3 inches2,560 x 1,600AMD Ryzen 3 73208 GB128 GBAsus Chromebook CX14Chrome OS14 inches1,920 x 1,200Intel Celeron N45008 GB128 GBFramework Laptop 12Windows/Linux12.2 inches1,920 x 1,200Intel Core i3-1315UN/AN/ALenovo IdeaPad 5i 2-in-1Windows16 inches1,920 x 1,200Intel Core Ultra 7 255U16 GB512 GBAcer Nitro 17Windows17.3 inches1,920 x 1,080AMD Ryzen 7 8845HS16 GB1 TBLenovo Chromebook Duet Gen 9Chrome OS10.9 inches1,920 x 1,200MediaTek Kompanio 8384 GB64 GBSamsung Galaxy Chromebook PlusChrome OS15.6 inches1,920 x 1,080Intel Core 3 100U8 GB128 GBOther Budget Laptops to ConsiderPhotograph: Daniel Thorp-LancasterThe Acer Chromebook Plus Spin 714 for $750: The Acer Chromebook Plus Spin 714 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) checks a lot of boxes. It has a surprisingly premium feel for such an affordable machine, and the keyboard and trackpad are excellent for those of us who type all day long. It also has one of the best displays I’ve seen on a Chromebook, with fantastic colors that pop off the glossy touch display. It's just a bit too expensive compared to something like the new Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14.Acer Swift Go 14 for $730: The Acer Swift Go 14 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) has a chintzy build quality, a stiff touchpad, and lackluster keyboard backlighting, but it's hard to beat the performance you get at this price. There's also an array of ports that make it very versatile, including a microSD card slot. The Intel Core Ultra 7 155H chip with 16 GB of RAM makes for a surprisingly powerful punch when it comes to productivity work, and our tester noted decent results in AI tasks as well. We averaged 11 hours in our battery test (with a full-brightness YouTube video on loop), which is respectable.Acer Chromebook Plus CX34 for $260: If you want to stand out from the crowd a bit and don’t need Windows, the Asus Chromebook Plus CX34 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is the best-looking Chromebook. When I got my hands on the CX34, I was impressed by its beautiful white design that stands out in a sea of gray slabs. It’s not left wanting for power, either, with the Core i5 CPU inside offering plenty of performance to easily handle multiple tabs and app juggling.What Are Important Specs in a Cheap Laptop?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronRead our How to Choose the Right Laptop guide if you want all the details on specs and what to look for. In short, your budget is the most important factor, as it determines what you can expect out of the device you're purchasing. But you should consider display size, chassis thickness, CPU, memory, storage, and port selection. While appropriate specs can vary wildly when you're considering laptops ranging from $200 to $800, there are a few hard lines I don't recommend crossing.For example, don't buy a laptop if doesn't have a display resolution of at least 1920 x 1080. In 2025, there's just no excuse for anything less than that. You should also never buy a laptop without at least 8 GB of RAM and 128 GB of storage. Even in Chromebooks, these specs are becoming the new standard. You're selling yourself short by getting anything less. Another rule is to avoid a Windows laptop with an Intel Celeron processor—leave those for Chromebooks only.Specs are only half the battle though. Based on our years of testing, laptop manufacturers tend to make compromises in display quality and touchpad quality. You can't tell from the photos or listed specs online, but once you get the laptop in your hands, you may notice that the colors of the screen look a bit off or that the touchpad feels choppy to use. It's nearly impossible to find laptops under $500 that don't compromise in these areas, but this is where our reviewers and testers can help.How Much RAM Do You Need in a Cheap Laptop?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronThe simple answer? You need at least 8 GB of RAM. These days, there are even some Windows laptops at around $700 or $800 that come with 16 GB of RAM standard, as part of the Copilot+ PC marketing push. That's a great value, and ensures you'll get the best performance out of your laptop, especially when running heavier applications or multitasking. Either way, it's important to factor in the price of the RAM, because manufacturers will often charge $100 or even $200 to double the memory.On Chromebooks, there are some rare occasions where 4 GB of RAM is acceptable, but only on the very cheapest models that are under $200. Even budget Chromebooks like the Asus Chromebook CX15 now start with 8 GB of RAM.Are There Any Good Laptops Under $300?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronYes, but you need to be careful. Don't just go buy a random laptop on Amazon under $300, as you'll likely end up with an outdated, slow device that you'll regret purchasing. You might be tempted by something like this or this, but trust me—there are better options, some of which you'll find in this guide.For starters, you shouldn't buy a Windows laptop under $300. That price puts you solidly in cheap Chromebook territory. While these are still budget-level in terms of quality, they're better in almost every way than their Windows counterparts of a similar price. A good example is the Asus Chromebook CX15.If you want a Windows laptop that you won't give you instant buyers remorse, you'll need to spend at least a few hundred more. Once you hit $500 or $600, there are some more solid Windows laptops available, such as the Acer Aspire Go 14, though even there, you're making some significant compromises in performance and storage capacity. These days, Windows laptops really start to get better in the $600-plus range.Should You Buy a Chromebook or a Cheap Windows Laptop?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronThe eternal question. If you're looking for a laptop under $500, I highly recommend that you opt for a Chromebook. I know that won't be a possibility for everyone, as some have certain applications that require a Windows laptop or MacBook. If you do aim to get a Chromebook, make sure all your connected accessories and other devices are compatible.Chromebooks give you access to a full desktop Chrome browser, as well as Android apps. While that leaves some gaps for apps that some may need, you might be surprised by how much you can get done without the need to install any software. Most applications have web versions that are every bit as useful.While Chromebooks are most well-known as junky student laptops, the recent “Chromebook Plus” designation has filled in the gap between dirt-cheap Chromebooks and $800 Windows laptops. You'll find some great Chromebook Plus options in the $400 to $600 range that have better performance and displays, while also looking a bit more like a modern laptop. The Lenovo Flex 5i Chromebook Plus is a great example of this. You can read more about the differences between Windows laptops and Chromebooks here.Power up with unlimited access to WIRED.
