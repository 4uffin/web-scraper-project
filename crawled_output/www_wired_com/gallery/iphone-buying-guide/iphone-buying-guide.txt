This is the best time of the year to buy a new iPhone, if you need to upgrade, as Apple just released its latest iPhone 17 lineup. I’ve tested every model and outlined its strengths and weaknesses so you can get the right one for you.Check out our other Apple buying guides, including Which iPhone 17 Model to Buy, Best iPhone 17 Cases, Best iPhone 16 Cases, Best MagSafe Accessories, Best MagSafe Chargers, Best MagSafe Wallets, and Best Apple 3-in-1 Chargers. Wondering what's new in iOS 26? We have details on that, too.Updated September 2025: We’ve added the new iPhone 17 lineup, details about iOS 26, and new accessories like Nomad's Leather Mag Wallet, Anker's MagGo grip, Apple's Dynamic Power Adapter, Nomad's Slim Power Adapter, and Apple's MagSafe Battery for iPhone Air.But First, Sell That Old iPhone!AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronIf you’re upgrading from an iPhone, you can trade it to Apple for a small discount. Before you do that, check whether you can sell it elsewhere for more money. iPhones hold their value incredibly well, particularly if they’re in mint or good condition. We have a guide that runs through the process of selling your phone, and we generally recommend you use websites like Swappa, Gazelle, or Back Market.We also have a handful of setup guides you should follow:How to Back Up Your iPhoneHow to Transfer Data to a New iPhoneHow to Factory Reset Your Old iPhoneHow to Set Up a New iPhoneKey Settings to Change on Your iPhoneBuying From Apple vs. a CarrierAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronMost people in the US purchase iPhones from carriers, which means the devices are locked to that network. If you bought an iPhone from Verizon, that means you can't easily switch to another carrier without breaking a contract and paying extra fees. It also poses headaches for travelers who want to use international SIM cards when traveling.The easier approach is to buy directly from Apple, though there are some things you should know:Connect to any carrier later: Choose this option for the most hassle-free experience. You get an unlocked iPhone, and then all you need to do is transfer the SIM card from your old iPhone to the new one to get started. This might be painless, though you may need to contact your carrier if the iPhone can't complete the eSIM transfer. In the US, Apple hasn't included a SIM tray since 2022's iPhone 14.Choose a carrier: If you choose a carrier through Apple.com, you will get an unlocked iPhone no matter which carrier you choose (except if you purchase with AT&T on an installment plan). The downside is that Apple doesn't have the same offers as the carriers, so you may lose out on a deal. However, carrier offers often require new lines, trade-ins, or an upgraded plan, and the savings come in the form of bill credits, so these deals aren't as amazing as they may seem.Finance: You can finance your iPhone through Apple either with Apple Card monthly installments, if you have an Apple credit card, or as Apple iPhone Payments. You need to choose a carrier here, but Apple confirmed these devices are all unlocked. You have to fill out a credit application to see if you qualify. If you opt to finance through a carrier on Apple.com, only the T-Mobile and Verizon models will be unlocked. The AT&T and Boost Mobile options are locked iPhones, so it's no different from buying it on an installment plan directly from those carriers.iPhone Upgrade Program: Buying directly from Apple also nets you access to the iPhone Upgrade Program. Is it worth it? Broadly speaking, no. Most people do not need to upgrade to a new iPhone every single year. It's expensive, though it does include two years of the company's AppleCare+ protection plan. If you really want to get the latest iPhone every year, then this program makes more sense, but it's still expensive.What Is Apple Intelligence?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuThe most hyped-up feature from the iPhone 16 range was Apple Intelligence, which rolled out in iOS 18.1. This is Apple's suite of artificial intelligence features, following the wave started by the likes of ChatGPT and Google's Gemini. Apple Intelligence is available on the iPhone 15 Pro/Pro Max and newer, including the iPhone 16e (not to mention select iPads and MacBooks).What exactly is Apple Intelligence in the first place? It's a collection of features that draw on the power of large language models to introduce “smart” capabilities. For example, in the Voice Memo and Notes app, you can now start a recording and get a real-time transcription. You can even record a call and get the transcription saved in the Notes app. Siri has been redesigned and can understand when you misspeak, and can even plug into ChatGPT for more powerful responses to open-ended questions. There are writing tools available throughout the operating system that let you change the tone of your emails or proofread text so you don't make an unnecessary typo on Threads.This is just a small sampling, I've boiled down many of the Apple Intelligence features here, and additional features keep rolling out in iOS updates. For example, Genmoji—which lets you create your own emojis—debuted alongside the AI image generation app, Image Playground, in iOS 18.2. In iOS 26, Apple added real-time Live Translation over phone calls and in Messages, powered by Apple Intelligence. The Visual Intelligence feature has also been upgraded to scan the iPhone screen to answer any of your questions.If you don't care for Apple Intelligence and want to turn it off, you can! We have a helpful guide detailing the exact steps.What Is MagSafe?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronMagnetic MagSafe wireless charging is available on the iPhone 12, iPhone 13, iPhone 14, iPhone 15, iPhone 16, and iPhone 17 models (except the iPhone 16e), and it allows you to magnetically attach various accessories to the back of the iPhone. (iPhones support support Qi2, which is the open standard, whereas MagSafe is proprietary; you can use Qi2 accessories just like MagSafe.)You can get first-party accessories like Apple's MagSafe Wireless Charger, which sticks to the back for faster charging. Or snag the MagSafe Wallet so you can keep your credit card attached to your phone. There are plenty of third-party accessories (you'll find quite a few in our guide), and MagSafe doesn't just have to be charging accessories like power banks or wireless chargers. There are a wealth of useful tools, from wallets, tripods and camera cages to notepads and ring lights that can attach to the back of the iPhone and add extra versatility.If you plan to use a case, get one that has MagSafe embedded inside to ensure a strong magnetic connection with Apple's accessories (non-MagSafe cases can interrupt MagSafe and make the magnetic connection weaker). All of the cases in our case guides are MagSafe-tested by yours truly. And yes, a case is a smart investment because iPhones are made of glass, and glass breaks, even if Apple uses ceramic to strengthen it. I cracked my iPhone 16 Plus after a 4-foot drop to the pavement—that model's ceramic glass was supposed to be twice as strong as previous iPhones, too! Ouch. See my favorite cases for the iPhone 16, iPhone 15, and iPhone 14 ranges.Best iPhone OverallPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuChevronChevronAppleiPhone 17$799 Apple$830 Best BuyThe iPhone 17 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is nearly the perfect phone, and it's what most people looking for a new iPhone should buy. With this model, Apple has finally upgraded the screen's refresh rate to 120 Hz. This might not sound like the snazziest feature, but you'll immediately notice everything feeling smoother and more responsive as you use the phone, especially if you're coming from an iPhone with a 60-Hz display. The slightly larger display can also hit up to 3,000 nits of peak brightness, which means you shouldn't have any trouble reading it in sunny conditions, and the new anti-reflective coating should also help cut glare. It's protected by Apple's new Ceramic Shield 2 glass, which supposedly is three times more scratch-resistant than before.More excitingly, the selfie camera has been upgraded to 24 megapixels (binned down to 18 MP). It's the same across the entire iPhone 17 lineup, and Apple is using a square sensor for the first time. It's smart and helpful because you can keep holding your iPhone firmly in portrait orientation, but digitally switch to landscape or portrait orientation when taking a selfie without having to rotate the phone in your hand. It'll also automatically zoom and rotate orientations when it detects more people in the frame (Apple calls it Center Stage). You can also natively shoot video with the front and rear cameras simultaneously with Dual Capture.Storage has been bumped to 256 GB (finally!), and the ultrawide camera has been upgraded to 48 megapixels, delivering sharp results even in low-light conditions. There's a slightly bigger battery, too, though I'm still testing the iPhone 17 and will have more concrete details to share on run time (so far so good!). I only wish Apple added a telephoto zoom camera here—Android phones at this price are starting to see more optical zoom options, like the Google Pixel 10 and Samsung Galaxy S25, and it would make this iPhone more versatile. (At least the “optical-like” 2X zoom is decent.)All in all, this is one of the most well-rounded and feature-rich iPhones in years, even if it doesn't feature the fun Camera Plateau design from the rest of the iPhone 17 lineup.SpecsDisplay: 6.3 inch, 120 Hz, OLEDProcessor and RAM: A19 (5-core GPU) with 8 GB RAMStorage: 256 or 512 GBCameras: 48-MP Fusion Camera, 48-MP ultrawide with Macro, 18-MP selfie cameraFeatures: Qi2 25W (MagSafe) wireless charging, Face ID, Dynamic Island, Ultra Wideband (2nd Gen), IP68, N1 networking chip, Dual Capture, Center StageThe Midrange iPhonePhotograph: Julian Chokkattu; Getty ImagesAppleiPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus$699 Apple$799 Apple (16 Plus)$730 Best BuyWant to spend a little less? Or maybe you prefer the bright and bold colors of the iPhone 16 range. Well, Apple still sells the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus (8/10, WIRED Recommends) for $699 and $799. I would try to find them for cheaper at other retail channels if possible—I personally wouldn't pay $799 for the iPhone 16 Plus when the iPhone 17 costs the same, even if it has a bigger screen and larger battery. (There is no new iPhone 17 Plus model; Apple replaced it with the iPhone Air.)Both iPhone 16 models have the same features, so you're largely choosing whether you want a small or a big phone. That said, the 6.7-inch iPhone 16 Plus delivers excellent battery life; I hit more than seven hours of screen-on time, and it had 42 percent left in the tank! The 6.1-inch iPhone 16 can get you through a day, but heavy users may need a top-up before bedtime. They feature the Action Button, which replaced the mute switch from older iPhones, but you can bring that functionality back or customize this button to do something else. There's also Camera Control, which launches the camera and doubles as a shutter button. A light amount of pressure on this button lets you switch camera modes or photography styles, and you can slide your finger to cycle through them. (I hate this secondary function, so I always disable it; Settings > Camera > Camera Control > Customize and toggle off Light Press and Swipe.SpecsDisplay: 6.1 inch and 6.7 inch, 60 Hz, OLEDProcessor and RAM: A18 (5-core GPU) with 8 GB RAMStorage: 128, 256, or 512 GBCameras: 48-MP Fusion Camera, 12-MP ultrawide with Macro, 12-MP selfie cameraFeatures: Qi2/MagSafe wireless charging, IP68, Ultra Wideband, Apple Intelligence, Face ID, Dynamic Island, Action button, Camera ControlThe Ultimate iPhonePhotograph: Julian ChokkattuPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuChevronChevronAppleiPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max$1,099 Apple (Pro)$1,100 Best Buy (Pro)$1,199 Apple (Pro Max)$1,200 Best Buy (Pro Max)You asked for it, and Apple delivered. The iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max (9/10, WIRED Recommends) are some of the thickest iPhones in recent memory because Apple has stuffed them with big batteries. For the first time, you may not need to charge your iPhone every single day anymore. Seriously, I routinely hit close to 7 hours of screen-on time and had 30 or 40 percent left, depending on the device. If you want the best battery life on a smartphone, this is it, particularly the Pro Max. Outside of battery and screen size, these two iPhones have the same features.The second biggest upgrade in the iPhone 17 Pro models isn't a sexy topic: thermal conductivity. Apple switched to aluminum and added a vapor chamber cooling system to manage heat better. By dissipating heat across the back of the devices, these iPhones can stay cooler for longer and eke out more from the A19 Pro chipset. It helps make them the most powerful smartphones. I played Assassin's Creed Mirage for more than an hour, and while the iPhone was warm, there weren't any hot spots. I also saw no stutters and lag at max graphical settings, a step up from its predecessors. Meanwhile, the iPhone Air got uncomfortably hot in one specific spot, and I ran into more stutters after prolonged play. If you plan to play demanding games on your smartphone or tackle processing-intensive tasks, buy one of the Pro models.The cameras didn't just get a fun new redesign on the back. Apple has upgraded the telephoto to 48 megapixels, so now every rear camera is 48 MP. It zooms up to 4X, though you can get optical-like quality at up to 8X. If you're wondering, yes, the iPhone 16 Pro offered 5X optical zoom, but the larger sensor here and higher megapixel count mean you'll get sharper and brighter zoom photos in the iPhone 17 Pro than ever before. If you capture a lot of video with the rear cameras, that's also another reason to buy these iPhones, because they offer some of the best native video quality on a smartphone. (I have plenty of examples in my review!)There isn't one big new feature on the iPhone 17 Pro or iPhone 17 Pro Max (outside of the flashy new look). But each of these small upgrades makes them remarkable devices, and one of Apple's best iPhones to date.SpecsDisplay: 6.3 and 6.9 inch, 120 Hz, OLEDProcessor and RAM: A19 Pro (6-core GPU) with 12 GB RAMStorage: 256, 512 GB, or 1 TB | 2 TB (Max only)Cameras: 48-MP Fusion camera, 48-MP ultrawide with Macro, 48-MP telephoto with 4X zoom, 18-MP front cameraFeatures: Qi2 25W (MagSafe) wireless charging, Face ID, Dynamic Island, Ultra Wideband (2nd Gen), IP68, N1 networking chip, Vapor chamber cooling, Dual Capture, Center Stage, 4K 120 fps video captureAn Ultralight and Ultrathin iPhonePhotograph: Julian ChokkattuPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuChevronChevronAppleiPhone Air$999 Apple$1,000 Best BuyThe iPhone Air (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is the first model of its kind. Borrowing from other “Air” models—the original MacBook Air and iPad Air—it's the thinnest iPhone ever made at a mere 5.6 mm thick and one of the lightest at 165 grams. The difference is palpable, especially considering its large 6.5-inch screen. Use the iPhone Air for a day, and the iPhone 17 Pro will feel like a brick.It's not for everyone. Think of it like an early-adopter iPhone, as the design innovations here may very well lead to a folding iPhone in the future. But there are a few too many compromises considering the price. Namely, the camera system. We're all used to multi-camera setups on our smartphones, and a single-lens design for a $999 handset in 2025 is too limiting. It sports the same 48-MP main camera as the iPhone 17, though the cheaper iPhone sometimes delivers sharper results. You can use the 2X “optical-like” zoom, but that's it. There's no ultrawide and no telephoto camera. I even tried to take a close-up photo of a flower, and the lack of a macro mode meant I couldn't move the iPhone Air as close to the subject. Thankfully, it has the same great 18-MP selfie camera as the rest of the iPhone 17 lineup.The other major compromise is battery life, though this depends on how you use your phone. I was pleasantly surprised at the iPhone Air's runtime, which often hit more than 5 hours of screen-on time. That's better than I expected. With average use, it lasted me a full day, and I didn't feel too anxious about it dying on me. However, on busier days, I needed to top it up in the afternoon. If you're a heavy user, relying on various battery-sucking apps like Maps or gaming, the iPhone Air's battery won't impress.This is the only iPhone with Apple's custom C1X modem, which is more power efficient, and one of the ways Apple can max out the battery life on the Air. The downside is that it doesn't support millimeter-wave 5G (mmWave). It won't impact you much since the dominant form of 5G is sub-6 (we have an explainer here), but mmWave is deployed in dense urban areas and high-traffic areas like airports and stadiums. It's weird to not have it on a flagship smartphone in 2025.If you barely use the camera and are regularly near a charger, there are plenty of cheaper smartphones that will serve you well. But if you must have an iPhone and want to try a super-thin and lightweight device, I think you'll be happy with the iPhone Air.SpecsDisplay: 6.5 inch, 120 Hz, OLEDProcessor and RAM: A19 Pro (5-core GPU) with 12 GB RAMStorage: 256, 512 GB, or 1 TBCameras: 48-MP Fusion Camera, 18-MP selfie cameraFeatures: Qi2 20W (MagSafe) wireless charging, Face ID, Dynamic Island, Ultra Wideband (2nd Gen), IP68, N1 networking chip, Apple C1X modem, Dual Capture, Center StageThe Cheapest iPhonePhotograph: Julian ChokkattuAppleiPhone 16e$599 Apple$600 Best BuyThe iPhone 16e (7/10, WIRED Review) may be Apple's cheapest iPhone, officially replacing the $429 iPhone SE, but that doesn't mean it's a good value. It omits a few too many convenient Apple features, despite the $599 price, like the Dynamic Island, MagSafe/Qi2, and the Ultra Wideband chip for precise AirTag tracking, not to mention it has only one rear camera. What you do get in return is fantastic battery life. It's a 6.1-inch iPhone (the smallest and the same size as the iPhone 16), but it crept close to the battery performance of the large iPhone 16 Plus. This is thanks to Apple's first-ever custom modem—the C1—which is more efficient than the previous modems in older iPhones.Even if you don't care for those missing features, the iPhone 16e still doesn't quite justify its high price, especially when compared to what other phones in this bracket offer. But if you just want a new iPhone and want to pay very little, this handset does the job.SpecsDisplay: 6.1 inch, 60 Hz, OLEDProcessor and RAM: A18 (4-core GPU) with 8 GB RAMStorage: 128, 256, or 512 GBCameras: 48-MP Fusion Camera, 12-MP selfie cameraFeatures: Qi wireless charging, IP68, Apple Intelligence, Face ID (notch), Action buttonOr Buy an iPhone 16 Pro InsteadPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuAppleiPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max$849 $736 (13% off) Amazon Renewed (Pro)$1,027 $975 (5% off) Amazon Renewed (Pro Max)$999 Best BuyApple no longer sells the iPhone 16 Pro or iPhone 16 Pro Max (8/10, WIRED Recommends), but you can find them at alternative retailers. As long as you're not paying MSRP (anything close to what the new iPhone 17 Pro models cost), they're great buys.They have many pro-level video recording features, like ProRes and 4K 120 frames per second video capture, which give you more options when editing. It'll feel powerful thanks to the A18 Pro chipset, and the triple-camera system won't feel drastically different from Apple's latest. Both of these devices have feature parity, so you are choosing between sizes (the iPhone 16 Pro is 6.3 inches and the iPhone 16 Pro Max is 6.9 inches).SpecsDisplay: 6.3 inch and 6.9 inch, 120 Hz, OLEDProcessor and RAM: A18 Pro (6-core GPU) with 8 GB RAMStorage: 128, 256, 512 GB, or 1 TBCameras: 48-MP Fusion Camera, 48-MP ultrawide with Macro, 12-MP telephoto with 5X zoom, 12-MP selfie cameraFeatures: Qi2/MagSafe wireless charging, IP68, Ultra Wideband, MagSafe, Apple Intelligence, Face ID, Dynamic Island, Action button, Camera Control, ProMotion, Always-on Display, titanium frame, 4K 120 fps video captureWhat's New in iOS 26?Photograph: Julian ChokkattuWait, what happened to iOS 19? If you're confused as to how we got to iOS 26 when the last version was iOS 18, don't worry: You didn't miss anything. Apple decided to change the naming structure for all of its operating systems to 26 this year to reflect 2026. It's kind of like new car models. The highlight in iOS 26 is the design: Liquid Glass. It's divisive, but there are ways to tone down the glassy look.The most practical and useful feature is the call screening tools in the Phone, Messages, and FaceTime apps. Once you opt in, your iPhone will screen calls from unknown callers, dramatically reducing the number of robocalls or scammers that dial your number. It works similarly in Messages by screening texts from unknown numbers and putting them in a separate tab. There's also a Hold Assist function during calls, so as soon as you hear the hold music, tap Hold Assist, and your iPhone will ping you when there's a real human on the other end.For more of the top features in iOS 26 and how to download it, check out our roundup.The Top New Features in Apple’s iOS 26 and iPadOS 26Your iPhone just got an update. Liquid Glass, iPad multitasking, and call screening—take a look at Apple’s new features in iOS 26 and iPadOS 26.By Julian ChokkattuCharging Adapters for Your iPhonePhotograph: Julian ChokkattuApple hasn't offered a charging brick in the box since the iPhone 12, so if you don't have one, we've got you covered with a few recommendations. Most of these are 30-watt chargers that will fast-charge most iPhones. If you want the fastest speeds on the iPhone 17 models, you'll need a 40-watt charger, and we have some picks for you.Anker 511 Nano 3 30-Watt Charger for $16: This is one of the tiniest chargers we've tested, and the prongs fold up for even more space savings. It comes in fun colors, and it's nice and cheap.Counterpart The Charger for $44: Why carry a charger and cable separately when you can get both in one? Retractable chargers are popular, and I love this attractive model from Counterpart. You can get it in a few colors, and the USB-C cable extends up to four feet. The prongs fold so they won't scratch anything in your bag, and the 35-watt output is enough to fast-charge most iPhones and iPads. It'll recharge a MacBook, though a MacBook Pro requires a more powerful charger.Apple 40W Dynamic Power Adapter
Photograph: Julian ChokkattuApple 40W Dynamic Power Adapter for $40: Apple's new Dynamic Power Adapter will get you the fastest charging speeds possible on the iPhone 17 models. That's 50 percent in just 20 minutes, and I was able to replicate that in my tests. It's a smaller charger than prior models, and it's one of the few chargers with SPR AVS support (Standard Power Range Adjustable Voltage Supply). It's a mouthful, but essentially, it can boost power output up to 60 watts when needed. That means it's a more versatile charger that you can use for your MacBook Air and your iPhone.Nomad Slim 65W Power Adapter for $55: This is my go-to charger whenever I travel. It's incredibly slim, has heaps of power, and has two USB-C ports so I can charge multiple devices simultaneously. The adapter can get quite hot, but I've used this charger for years with no issues.The Right USB-C CablePhotograph: Simon HillCable MattersUSB-C to USB-C Thunderbolt 4$32 $30 (6% off) AmazonThe problem with USB-C is that its capabilities are so vast, but not every USB-C cable supports every single function. You need to make sure the cable you buy supports video output, speedy data transfer, and fast charging if that's what you want. The cable Apple includes in the box can carry up to 60 watts of power, and that's pretty much it. You can use this cable to recharge a MacBook, but maybe not a MacBook Pro under heavy load.If you get a cable like this one from Cable Matters, you'll be covered for every scenario. It supports up to 100 watts of power so you can use it for all your gadgets, has DisplayPort to work with external monitors, and supports up to 40 gigabits per second of data transfer. It also comes in multiple lengths.Read our Best USB-C Cables guide for more.Get a MagSafe Portable BatteryPhotograph: Simon HillAnkerMagGo Power Bank (10K) (Qi2)$90 Amazon$90 Walmart$90 AnkerThe beauty of MagSafe is that you can pop a battery on the back of your iPhone, and you don't have to worry about any wires. This is our top recommendation, and it supports the Qi2 standard, so it will work with any device with Qi2. It has a 10,000-mAh capacity that is good to recharge an iPhone fully once and then some, and there's a built-in kickstand so you can continue watching your favorite show as it charges. Best of all is the built-in LED display, helpful for seeing how much juice the charger has left.Read our Best MagSafe Power Banks guide for more recommendations.Photograph: Julian ChokkattuAppleiPhone Air MagSafe Battery$99 Amazon$99 AppleApple has a dedicated slim MagSafe Battery for the iPhone Air. It takes advantage of the Air's new design and fits perfectly on the back. (It will work with other iPhones, but you have to place the battery horizontally, making the whole thing awkward.) No, this $99 accessory isn't really worth it. You can find higher-capacity batteries for less money. In my tests, I was able to get 68 percent back on my iPhone Air before the 3,149-mAh MagSafe Battery died. However, it's still pretty dang slim, worked reliably, and fits like a glove. Maybe catch it on sale.Get a 3-in-1 Wireless ChargerPhotograph: Simon HillBelkin3-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand$130 $110 (15% off) Amazon$110 Best Buy$130 Apple$110 BelkinIf you have an iPhone, there's a chance you have another Apple gadget, like AirPods or an Apple Watch. If so, you really should get a 3-in-1 charger for your home. We have tons of options in our Best Apple 3-in-1 Chargers guide, but this Belkin MagSafe model is our favorite. It has an elegant design and charges the iPhone and Apple Watch at maximum speeds, and you can pop your earbuds on the base to top them up. It won't work with the iPhone 16e unless you get a MagSafe case, and even then, you won't be privy to the faster and more efficient charging speeds.Use a MagSafe GripPhotograph: Brenda StolyarAnkerMagGo 610$16 $14 (13% off) Amazon$16 AnkerIt's simple, cheap, and versatile. Anker's MagGo 610 grip magnetically sticks to the back of your iPhone and has a metal ring. Pop this out to use it as a kickstand in landscape orientation, or as a finger loop for enhanced grip when using your iPhone. Read our Best MagSafe Grips guide for plenty of other recommendations, including flashy options like this heart-shaped PopSockets grip.Carry a MagSafe WalletPhotograph: Molly HigginsCourtesy of NomadChevronChevronNomadLeather Mag Wallet$85 Nomad$80 VerizonHate bringing a wallet with you everywhere? Stick it to the back of your iPhone! This Nomad leather wallet is classy and can hold about four cards. What makes it unique is that it features Apple's Find My, meaning you can track its location in the Find My app if you lose it. That does mean the wallet needs to recharge every once in a while, but you can conveniently recharge it with any MagSafe charger, no proprietary cable needed. (It should last around 5 months on a single charge.) Read our Best MagSafe Wallets guide for more options.The MagSafe world is wonderful and weird. We have plenty more recommendations in our Best MagSafe Accessories guide, ranging from MagSafe camera cages and tripods to notepads you can magnetically stick to the back of your iPhone.Avoid These iPhonesAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronThe iPhone 13 and older iPhones are probably available somewhere, but you shouldn't take the bait. They don't have the processing power to keep up with the latest software, and even if they do, they will have a much shorter software shelf life or lack modern features like USB-C. The only older iPhones worth considering at the moment are the iPhone 14 or iPhone 15 series, even better if it's the Pro models, if you can find them at low prices. Only the latter has the USB-C charging port, though.The iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, and iPhone XR are cut off from receiving the iOS 26 update, so they're especially ones to avoid. Without software support, your device will slowly become less secure and could become a slow, buggy mess.The iPhone's Charging Port Is Now USB-CAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronThe iPhone 15 range ditched the long-standing Lightning port for USB-C, and it's now in the iPhone 16 and iPhone 17 range too. This is the same charging port on iPads, MacBooks, Android phones, Windows laptops, and many more personal tech gadgets. USB-C is often called the “universal port” because it can technically handle various responsibilities. For example, you can plug in external displays and extend the iPhone's screen or connect the same USB-C accessories you might be currently using on your laptop, like SD card readers. Sadly, it does mean your Lightning accessories won't work unless you get dongles.You can read more about what the port does here, but there are two important things to note:The iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16e, iPhone 17, and iPhone Air support the USB 2.0 standard just like the iPhones before, so you'll max out at 480 megabits per second of data transfer speeds.The iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, iPhone 16 Pro, iPhone 16 Pro Max, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max support the USB 3.0 standard and are capable of up to 10 gigabits per second of data transfer speeds.What’s the Deal With eSIMs?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronAll iPhone 14 and newer devices completely ditch the physical SIM tray in the US, meaning you can no longer just pop your physical SIM inside to turn on cellular connectivity. Instead, you'll have to rely on an eSIM. You can read more about them here. This tech has been available in iPhones since the iPhone XS and XR, but now you have to use it. Apple has also started switching more global models to eSIM only, like the iPhone Air.) When you're setting up your new iPhone, you'll automatically be asked to transfer your number from your previous iPhone, and the whole process should take a few minutes without any hassle. (eSIMs are more secure than physical SIMs.) Once you transfer your number, your physical SIM card won't work anymore.There's a chance you may still run into some issues, especially if you're coming from an Android phone (or want to switch back to an Android phone). You'll have to check with your carrier to get your cellular connection in working order again. It shouldn't take long, but it's not as simple as popping in a physical card.How to Replace Your iPhone's BatteryAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronIf you don't want to spend the money to get a new iPhone, consider a fresh battery. If the biggest issues with your aging iPhone revolve around how long it lasts in a day, replacing the battery might make it feel brand-new. (Apple's iPhone 16, 16 Plus, and 16e have an easier-to-replace battery.)Replacements for older iPhones are $89, and $99 or $119 for newer models. If that doesn't do the trick, read our guide on ways to fix your iPhone's problems or our guide on selling your iPhone to get the most money for it.What Is the Action Button and Camera Control Button?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronThe Action Button debuted on the iPhone 15 Pro models, and they're now standard on every iPhone in the lineup. It sits above the volume rocker on the left edge of the phones. It effectively replaces the old Mute Switch, but think of it as just a configurable button. You can have it still control the mute function of the phone, or customize it (Settings > Action Button) to trigger the flashlight, a Voice Memo, or even launch an app or Shortcut.Camera Control is another newer addition that debuted on the iPhone 16 series. On the right edge of the phone below the power button, press it to launch the Camera app, and you can press it to capture a photo or start recording a video. A light tap and swipe can move through different camera lenses or modes, but I found this annoying. (You can configure it by heading to Settings > Camera > Camera Control.) Press and hold this button and you'll trigger Apple's Visual Intelligence. It'll use the camera to identify subjects in front of you, very much like Google Lens, so you can ask questions via Google or ChatGPT about what you're looking at.Power up with unlimited access to WIRED.
