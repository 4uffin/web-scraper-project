Maybe you've started with an organic mattress, or maybe you're looking for the best organic sheets to get you started on your organic journey. Bedding is a great place to start when looking to switch things in your life to organic. You're spending eight hours a night with your face smushed into your mattress and sheets, breathing in everything that's inside of them. That visual alone should make it easy to see why the materials in your sheets matter.Organic sheets leave chemicals like formaldehyde and TCEP (a flame retardant) out of your bedroom and away from your skin. Just about every kind of bedding can be organic, depending on how it's made and how its materials are sourced. There are a handful of certifications you can look for to know your bedding is organically sourced and nontoxic. Primarily, you'll find Global Organic Textile Standard, or GOTS, which certifies that the sourcing is organic, and Oeko-Tex, which certifies that nontoxic chemicals were used. See our certifications explainer here. GOTS certification doesn’t yet cover bamboo sheets.But no matter what kind of certifications it has, we've slept on every kind of bedding you can find and found the best in every category. Our overall favorite is the Coyuchi Cloud Soft Sateen Sheets ($278), which live up to the soft name and come with a GOTS certification to boot. If you're looking for something more affordable, Aeptom's Organic Bamboo Sateen Sheets ($138) are well priced for being soft, lightweight, and packing a couple health and eco-conscious certifications. If you want something extra lightweight, The Citizenry's Organic Percale ($189) is a fantastically soft, breathable percale set that uses GOTS-certified long-staple cotton.Read every organic sheet set we've tried below; all prices are for queen sizes. Don't miss our guides to the Best Organic Mattresses, Best Mattress Toppers, Best Sheets, Best Mattresses, Best Pillows, and Best Down Comforters. Plus, we've got advice on to cleaning everything on your bed, what thread count really means, and whether or not you need a duvet.Updated September 2025: This guide has two new top picks, Coyuchi's Cloud Soft Organic Sateen and Aeptom's Bamboo Sateen sheets. We've also updated the Honorable Mentions section with new testing.Table of ContentsAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronComparing Our Favorite Organic SheetsWhat to Look for in Organic SheetsHonorable MentionsNot Quite OrganicFAQsThe Best Organic SheetsPhotograph: Nena FarrellPhotograph: Nena FarrellChevronChevronCoyuchiCloud Soft Organic Sateen Sheet Set$278 CoyuchiThese are my favorite organic sheets I've tried. Coyuchi's Cloud Soft Sateen Sheets live up to the name with a super soft feel to them, thanks to the sateen weave. These sheets are GOTS certified, and Coyuchi also finishes these off with a USDA-certified bio-based softener that makes them feel softly lived in, versus the silky-soft feel you usually find with sateen.Even with the heavier weave, since sateen is a three-over-one thread pattern versus percale's lighter one-over-one (making percale usually the better choice for summer and hot sleepers) these still felt surprisingly lightweight. The feel reminded me more of extra-soft percale than I expected for such soft sateen. I really enjoyed sleeping on them on mild summer nights without getting sweaty, and these would be plenty comfortable in warmer seasons, too. I also like that there are undyed options if you're looking to avoid fabric dye.MaterialOrganic cottonOrganic certificationsGlobal Organic Textile Standard (GOTS)IncludesFitted sheet, flat sheet, and two pillowcasesSize optionsTwin to California kingMattress depthDeep pockets up to 15 inchesTrial period / return policy30-day returns, 180-day returns for store creditBest Budget Organic SheetsPhotograph: Nena FarrellPhotograph: Nena FarrellCourtesy of AeptomChevronChevronAeptomBamboo Sateen Bed Sheet Set$138 AeptomOrganic sheets aren't cheap, but these bamboo sheets from Aeptom are cheaper than most non-organic sheets and still happen to be soft and breathable, and pack some organic certifications. Bamboo doesn't have overarching certifications for organic sourcing yet the way cotton and linen can be GOTS certified, but these sheets still pack an Oeko-Tex certification and are certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (or FSC) for eco-conscious sourcing.While these sheets don't have as many certifications as Ettitude's bamboo bedding (see below for more details on those!), I was impressed with everything Aeptom's sheets could offer at such a good price point. These sheets are my new favorite bamboo sheets, as well as a great choice if you're shopping organic.MaterialBamboo viscose made from FSC-certified bambooOrganic certificationsOeko-Tex Standard 100, FSC-Certified bambooIncludesFitted sheet, flat sheet, and two pillowcasesSize optionsTwin to California kingMattress depthDeep pockets up to 15 inchesTrial period / return policy30-day returnsBest Cotton Percale Organic SheetsPhotograph: Nena FarrellPhotograph: Nena FarrellCourtesy of The CitizenryChevronChevronThe CitizenryOrganic Stonewashed Percale Sheet Set$189 $151 (20% off) The CitizenryI wasn't always a percale gal. Percale's one-over-one thread pattern that's known for crisp sheets, but cheaper percale can feel stiff and scratchy. But not these sheets. The Citizenry's percale will sell you on the sheet style if you aren't already a fan, and it's especially nice for hot sleepers or hotter seasons of the year.The Citizenry's Stonewashed Organic Percale uses long-staple cotton to make it softer than your regular cotton percale sheet. Long-staple cotton means it's stronger, longer cotton, so you don't need as many threads, making the sheet both more breathable and softer than a sheet with tons of short threads. It's one of my favorite all-time sets of sheets (and is one of our favorite 101 items in the WIRED 101!), and it's even a great budget buy compared to other organic options. These sheets have certifications from both GOTS and Oeko-Tex.MaterialOrganic, long-staple cottonOrganic certificationsGlobal Organic Textile Standard (GOTS), Oeko-TexIncludesFitted sheet, flat sheet, and two pillowcasesSize optionsFull to California kingMattress depthDeep pockets up to 15 inchesTrial period / return policy30-day returnsBest Bamboo Organic SheetsPhotograph: Nena FarrellPhotograph: Nena FarrellPhotograph: EttitudeChevronChevronEttitudeSignature Bamboo Sheet Set$333 Amazon$359 EttitudeBamboo is the new kid on the block compared with longtime bedding favorites like cotton or linen. It's a growing favorite for a reason, though, since bamboo is super soft to the touch and promises temperature-regulating abilities. Not all bamboo sheets can deliver on that promise, but these Ettitude sheets do a great job at being both incredibly soft and cooling.These sheets happen to come with a slew of organic certifications that make them worthy of your bed. You won't see the GOTS recommendation on these, and there's no overarching recommendation yet to confirm whether bamboo is organic in the same way you'll see for cotton or linen. Still, these sheets come with a nice mix of health and eco-conscious certifications—in fact, it's the most certification-decorated set of sheets we've tried.MaterialOrganic bamboo lyocellOrganic certificationsOeko-Tex Standard 100, BCorp, Eco-Cert Certified Organic, and FSC Certified BambooIncludesFitted sheet, flat sheet, and two pillowcasesSize optionsTwin and twin XL up to California kingMattress depthDeep pockets up to 17 inchesTrial period / return policy60-day trialBest Linen Organic SheetsCourtesy of NaturepedicNaturepedicOrganic Linen Sheets$499 NaturepedicThese linen sheets from Naturepedic are some of the few organic options you can find. Several brands that make other organic products don't have organically sourced linen, but Naturepedic's linen not only uses GOTS-certified flax and is Made Safe certified, but is also UL Greenguard certified, which means these sheets use low chemical emissions. Naturepedic says these sheets are additionally certified to meet Greenguard's formaldehyde-free standard.These sheets are on the rough side compared to other linen I've tested, but they're also impressively breathable while still maintaining a nice weight to them. I was surprisingly chilly while sleeping on these sheets, a sensation I rarely feel as a hot sleeper.MaterialOrganic flaxOrganic certificationsGlobal Organic Textile Standard (GOTS), Made Safe, and UL GreenGuardIncludesFitted sheet, flat sheet, and two pillowcases (can choose a partial set with one fitted sheet and two pillowcases)Size optionsQueen, king, and California kingMattress depthDeep pockets up to 15 inchesTrial period / return policy100-night trialBest Flannel Organic SheetsPhotograph: Nena FarrellCourtesy of Boll & BranchChevronChevronBoll & BranchCozy Flannel Sheet Set$349 Boll & BranchBoll & Branch's flannel sheets are incredibly soft, the softest I've slept on after I spent an entire winter testing the Best Flannel Sheets. These sheets are also made with 100 percent organic cotton, certified by GOTS, so they can achieve your super soft bedding dreams and your organic dreams in one fell swoop.These are also some of the only flannel sheets we recommend that are still in stock, so even though it's not the ideal time of year for flannel right now, you can snag them ahead of the cold season. The Boll & Branch flannel sheet set is incredibly warm and soft, but the sheets don't feel overly heavy or suffocating (in the winter, that is), even for a hot sleeper.MaterialOrganic cottonOrganic certificationsGlobal Organic Textile Standard (GOTS), Oeko-TexIncludesFitted sheet, flat sheet, and two pillowcases (split king includes two twin XL sheets)Size optionsTwin and twin XL to split kingMattress depthDeep pockets up to 18 inches (except twin)Trial period / return policy30-day returnsComparing Our Favorite Organic SheetsModelMaterialOrganic CertificationsSize OptionsMattress DepthTrial or Return WindowCoyuchi Cloud Soft Organic Sateen Sheet SetOrganic cottonGlobal Organic Textile Standard (GOTS)Twin, Full, Queen, King, Cal KingDeep pockets up to 15 inches30-day returns, 180-day store creditAeptom Organic Bamboo Sheet SetBamboo viscose made from FSC-certified bambooOeko-Tex Standard 100, FSC-Certified bambooTwin, Full, Queen, King, Cal KingDeep pockets up to 15 inches30-day returnsThe Citizenry Organic Stonewashed Percale Sheet SetOrganic, long-staple cottonGlobal Organic Textile Standard (GOTS), Oeko-TexFull, Queen, King, Cal KingDeep pockets up to 15 inches30-day returnsEttitude Signature Bamboo Sheet SetOrganic bamboo lyocellOeko-Tex Standard 100, BCorp, Eco-Cert Certified Organic, and FSC Certified BambooTwin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, Cal KingDeep pockets up to 17 inches60-day trialNaturepedic Organic Linen SheetsOrganic flaxGlobal Organic Textile Standard (GOTS), Made Safe, and UL GreenGuardQueen, King, Cal KingDeep pockets up to 15 inches100-night trialWhat to Look for in Organic SheetsOrganic means many things. It's often used to confirm that food was grown without toxic pesticides and chemicals, and doesn't have things like growth hormones or GMOs, in order to label it as organic food. For bedding, it should mean both that organic materials were used to make the fabric—no toxic pesticides used in farming, etc.—and that they were produced organically with nontoxic chemicals.You'll want at least two certifications to prove this. Most sheets have a Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS) certification to certify that the material sourced is organic (it'll say organically grown cotton, for example, but should have a certification to back it up), and you'll usually see either an Oeko-Tex or a Made Safe certification certifying that the process to make them was a safe and nontoxic one. If you only see an Oeko-Tex certification, that means they were manufactured organically, but not sourced organically. You're more likely to see a sole Oeko-Tex certification than any others, which is still a good certification, but not enough to be a fully organic bedsheet.Is it the same as eco-friendly? It depends on what eco-friendly means to you. Some processes are more eco-conscious, like lyocell's process over nylon and rayon based on chemical output, but producing anything has costs on the planet. These organic certifications usually only confirm toxicity and chemicals included, not necessarily how much waste was left over or whether the chemicals can be reused.Honorable MentionsThere are a lot of great organic sheets out there. Here are a few more organic bedding sets we tested and liked.Avocado Organic Cotton Sheets for $199: Avocado is known for its mattresses, but it makes organic bedding too. Avocado's organic cotton sheets have a sateen weave, which is a three-over-one thread pattern, and WIRED reviewer Scott Gilbertson says they're like sleeping on silk or satin. These sheets use 100 percent GOTS-certified organic cotton from India, and have the Made Safe certification, which certifies whether something has nontoxic materials. It's similar to Oeko-Tex, but Made Safe is applied to more products, while Oeko-Tex is textiles only.Brooklinen Organic Cotton Core Sheet Set for $239: This super-crisp sheet set from Brooklinen is made from Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS)-certified organic cotton and are Oeko-Tex certified, two key certifications when looking for organic bedding. This cotton sheet set has the nice, crisp feel that percale is known for, like fresh hotel bedding, and has a 270 thread count that helps keep it breathable.Boll & Branch Signature Sheet Set for $279: Boll & Branch's Signature sheets use GOTS-certified cotton and have an Oeko-Tex certification. These sheets also level up the sateen weave from a three-over-one pattern to a four-over-one pattern. I tested the textured stripe pattern, which still felt breathable even with the heavier weave, though not as soft as a regular sateen sheet since it had the extra texture.Coyuchi Organic Relaxed Linen Sheet Set for $598: Coyuchi's organic linen feels fairly soft right out of the box (for linen, at least; it certainly won't feel as soft as cotton sateen or bamboo sheets) and super breathable, without feeling thin or flimsy. The French flax yarns used are Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS)-certified, and are produced into linen sheets in Portugal. Coyuchi's linen sheets have a range of muted colors to choose from, and Coyuchi says the dyes are low-impact on the planet.Coyuchi Flannel Sheets for $298: These organic bedsheets are fantastic and soft, and are made from 100 percent GOTS-certified organic cotton (except for the stripe pattern, which uses a mix of recycled cotton and GOTS-certified cotton). The Boll & Branch flannel is a little softer, but Coyuchi's sheets are a little cheaper if you want to save a few bucks. These sheets are currently sold out, but we expect them to come back in stock for the cooler seasons.Ettitude Luxe Bamboo Sateen + Sheet Sets for $470: Ettitude's Luxe bamboo sheets promise that they're Ecocert organic, use 100 percent FSC-certified bamboo, and are Oeko-Tex Standard 100-certified. I found them a little heavy for my liking as a hot sleeper, but they're a fantastically soft and silky set that's organic.Quince Bamboo Sheet Set for $130: These affordable bamboo sheets from Quince claim to use 100 percent viscose from organic bamboo and have an Oeko-Tex Standard 100 certification that proves no toxic chemicals were used. While there's no overarching bamboo certification for organic, other sheets we recommend have an FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) certification to confirm eco-conscious sourcing instead. They're a nice, soft set, and are a little heavier than the other bamboo recommendations in this guide.Riley Organic Cotton Sheet Set for $260: This was a nice, lightweight sheet set, though my husband and I both had weird dreams on these sheets. It's only a 300 thread count, but it felt a little warmer to sleep on compared to percale sets I usually recommend. There's only an Oeko-Tex certification listed on the product page, but Riley confirmed the cotton is GOTS certified.Not Quite OrganicAvocado Natural Linen Sheets for $549: These linen sheets are some of the heaviest and most expensive we've tried. These linen sheets will likely last you many years, thanks to the heavy weight, and will get softer with every wash. These sheets were previously GOTS-certified, but now are only Oeko-Tex certified, which is why they aren't a pick. Avocado doesn't list them as organic anymore due to this.Quince Luxury Organic Sateen Sheet Set for $100: These sheets are marketed as 100 percent bamboo but only have an Oeko-Tex certification, which only confirms that the chemicals are nontoxic, lacking a GOTS or similar certification to confirm that the cotton sourced is organic. We've reached out to Quince to ask whether they have any certifications to prove the cotton is organic, but did not hear back. These sheets are also currently only available in a twin size.The Citizenry's Stonewashed Linen for $299: The Citizenry makes other organic sheets, but its linen set is only Oeko-Tex certified, so it's not fully organic. Still, if you aren't shopping for specifically organic linen, it's our favorite linen set.FAQsSo What Is Organic Bedding?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronYou've heard the term organic plenty of times when it comes to food, and it's not too different when applied to bedding. Organic bedding skips chemicals like formaldehyde and TCEP (a flame retardant) for both making the sheets and sourcing the materials those sheets are made of. You'll want to check certifications to make sure it's fully organic from both the sourcing and processing methods.How Do You Know If Sheets Are Organic?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronThere are a handful of certifications you can look for to know your bedding is organically sourced and uses nontoxic chemicals. The main one to look for for most sheet types, particularly anything made with cotton or flax, is the Global Organic Textile Standard, or GOTS, certification. GOTS will certify whether that source material is organic. The only type that you won't look for GOTS is for bamboo, which doesn't currently have an overarching organic certification like cotton and linen do.Then, you'll want to look for certifications that the chemicals and process used are also nontoxic. You'll usually see an Oeko-Tex certification, which certifies that nontoxic chemicals were used, but Made Safe is also a valid certification (Made Safe is less common since it's for lots of different product categories, while Oeko-Tex is a textile specific certification).Why Are Organic Sheets so Expensive?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronOrganic sheets retail for much more than the nonorganic versions. These sheets require nontoxic sourcing and processing, and those different avenues are a more expensive option to keep chemicals you don't want out of your bedding. It's a bummer skipping toxic chemicals isn't a cheaper experience, but it's worth investing in.How Does WIRED Test Organic Bedding?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWe test organic sheets the same way we test the rest of our sheets guides: by sleeping on them! Each set of sheets is slept on from anywhere between two and seven nights, depending on how it performs. It's also washed a minimum of two times to see if any changes or damages arise from washes. Our top picks continue to be used and tested year-around to see how well they hold up over time.How Does WIRED Obtain Sheets Samples? What Happens After WIRED Is Done Testing Sheets?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronMost bedsheets are provided to WIRED by the companies who make the sheets as a review sample, with no obligation to cover or promises of what that coverage could be. We also purchase sheet samples we'd like to test if we can't get press samples for the story. After testing, the top picks are kept for long-term testing, while the rest of the sheets are donated locally.Power up with unlimited access to WIRED.
