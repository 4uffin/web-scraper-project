The best sheets on Amazon come from brands we know and love, and shopping brands you're familiar with is one of many ways to avoid shoddy products on the ecommerce site.Sheets are a category where you can't get away with low quality, at least in the long term; it's best to invest in sheets with strong fibers that will last, and that are a legit brand that won't mix in harmful chemicals or take shortcuts on the sheets. This guide includes all our favorites we've tested that happen to be on Amazon, from cotton percale and sateen to bamboo and Tencel lyocell. We don't recommend any microfiber or polyester sheets in this guide, since they're lower quality and usually run warmer, too, so hot sleepers (like myself!) would be miserable.If you're looking for a great cotton sheet on Amazon, Buffy's Supima Cotton Sheet Set ($195) is one of my all-time favorite percale sheets to stay cool and still feel soft to the touch thanks to the Supima cotton used. Brooklinen's sheets are also available on Amazon, including its silky Luxe Sateen Core Set ($149) and its Organic Cotton Core Sheet Set ($239). Looking for something cheaper? Bedsure's GentleSoft Cooling Sheets ($70) and Laura Ashley's Cotton Flannel Bedding ($42) are a great price and comfortable to sleep on.Looking for more bedding ideas?

The brand is known for its eucalyptus bedding that's cool to the touch, and this percale sheet set is its newest addition to the lineup and first foray into cotton. Buffy's percale is just as comfy for keeping you cool, since it's a super breathable weave. It's softer than most other percale sheets, since it uses Supima cotton, a certified long-staple cotton that lets these sheets have a light thread count but still feel soft to the touch. It's one of my favorite cotton sheets, and you can always find them on Amazon. The only downside is they're usually on sale on Buffy's site, rather than on Amazon.Material100 percent Supima cottonCertificationsOeko-TexIncludesFitted sheet, flat sheet, and two pillowcasesSize optionsFull to California kingMattress depthStandardTrial period/return policySeven night trial with no charge, and 50-night returnsBest SateenCourtesy of BrooklinenBrooklinenLuxe Sateen Core Sheet Set$149 Amazon$199 $169 (15% off) BrooklinenBrooklinen's Luxe Sateen sheets are a great set of cotton sheets you can find on Amazon, with a silkier feel thanks to the three-over-one thread pattern that makes up a sateen weave. That style makes the sheets silky and cool to the touch, and these are silkier than cheaper options, like JCPenney's popular set. This set also has a higher thread count of 480, which helps them feel super soft, and Brooklinen says this set uses long-staple cotton too. That thread count and thicker weave also means they'll run a little warmer than lighter cotton, so I like these best for fall and spring nights.MaterialLong-staple cottonCertificationsOeko-TexIncludesFitted sheet, flat sheet, and two pillowcasesSize optionsTwin and twin XL up to California kingMattress depthDeepTrial period/return policy365-day returnsBest BambooPhotograph: Julia ForbesPhotograph: Julia ForbesCourtesy of BedsureChevronChevronBedsureGentleSoft Cooling Sheets$79 $56 (29% off) Amazon$90 BedsureWIRED reviewer Julia Forbes can't stop raving about Bedsure's bamboo sheets, and it's easy to see why. The bamboo rayon sheets are comfortable, cooling, and durable, lasting her for years, all for a great price. Bamboo in general is a big favorite of ours when it comes to bedding, and these sheets from Bedsure are our budget pick in our guide to the Best Bamboo Sheets. But even if you're not (yet) bamboo-obsessed like we are, if you're shopping on Amazon to find great sheets on a budget, there really isn't a better set to find at this price point.Material100 percent bamboo rayonCertificationsOeko-TexIncludesFitted sheet, flat sheet, and two pillowcasesSize optionsTwin and twin XL up to California king and split kingMattress depthDeepTrial period/return policy30-day returnsBest FlannelCourtesy of Laura AshleyLaura AshleyCotton Flannel Beddding Set$42 AmazonThe cheapest sheets I've ever liked from Amazon are actually a lightweight flannel. These affordable, soft sheets from Laura Ashley remind me of the popular L.L. Bean flannel; both are a lightweight flannel compared to thicker sets, and feel akin to brushed cotton (which is similar, but not the same as full flannelâ€”think half flannel). I love that this set comes in a wide variety of colors and prints, though price can vary depending on the style you choose. And even with such a cheap price point, these sheets are still Oeko-Tex certified.MaterialCotton flannelCertificationsOeko-TexIncludesFitted sheet, flat sheet, and two pillowcasesSize optionsTwin up to kingMattress depthStandardTrial period/return policy30-day returnsBest CoolingPhotograph: Nena FarrellCourtesy of Slumber CloudChevronChevronSlumber CloudPerformance Tencel Sheet Set$259 Slumber Cloud$264 AmazonAs a hot sleeper, I'm obsessed with these sheets. I grab the Slumber Cloud Performance Tencel Sheet Set whenever it might be a little hot at night (which is often, since I live in Southern California) to keep myself and my husband cool all night long. These sheets use the Tencel lyocell, which is a fiber made from wood pulp that's silky and cool to the touch after being processed into fiber, and Slumber Cloud's patented Outlast fiber, which uses phase-change material (PCM) gel to absorb heat. It actually works, which shocked me. Every other set I've tried that promises PCM to keep me cool has left me with night sweats worse than if I'd slept on a regular cotton or linen sheet set. These sheets have lasted well through my constant use of them over the last year, and they are available on Amazon.MaterialTencel lyocell and Slumber Cloud's Outlast fiber with PCM (phase change material)CertificationsNoneIncludesFitted sheet, flat sheet, and two pillowcases.

This cotton sheet set has the nice, crisp feel that percale is known for, like fresh hotel bedding, and has a 270-thread count that helps keep it super light and breathable. Brooklinen's Organic Cotton Sheets are a touch softer than the brand's regular percale, but they still really embody that light, slightly stiff feeling you'll want if you're a percale fan.MaterialOrganic cottonCertificationsGlobal Organic Textile Standard (GOTS), Oeko-TexIncludesFitted sheet, flat sheet, and two pillowcasesSize optionsFull to California kingMattress depthStandardTrial period/return policy365-day returnsComparing Our Favorite Sheets on AmazonModelMaterialCertificationsSize OptionsMattress DepthTrial Period / Return PolicyBuffy Supima Cotton Percale SheetsSupima cottonOeko-TexFull, queen, king, Cal kingStandard depth up to 12 inchesSeven night trial with no charge, and 50-night returnsBrooklinen Luxe Sateen Core Sheet SetLong-staple cottonOeko-TexTwin, twin XL, full, queen, king, Cal kingDeep pockets up to 16 inches365-day returnsBedsure GentleSoft Cooling SheetsBamboo rayonOeko-TexTwin, twin XL, full, queen, king, Cal kingDeep pockets up to 16 inches30-day returnsLaura Ashley Cotton Flannel Bedding SetCotton flannelOeko-TexTwin, full, queen, kingStandard depth up to 14 inches30-day returnsSlumberCloud Tencel PerformanceTencel lyocell and Slumber Cloud's Outlast fiber with PCM (phase change material)NoneTwin, twin XL, full, queen, king, Cal kingDeep pockets up to 16 inches60-night trialHonorable MentionsBoll & Branch Signature Sheets for $259: I love this brand's flannel, and this signature sheet set is a solid choice as well (though pricey compared to other cotton sheet sets I prefer).Buffy Eucalyptus Lyocell Sheet Set for $200: This set uses lyocell made from eucalyptus trees for a similar feel to bamboo sheetsâ€”silky and chilly to the touch. It's another unique cooling option, and great for folks who love soft bedding.Cariloha Classic Bamboo Sheet Set for $239: For being Cariloha's cheapest set, it still feels fantastic to sleep on and delivers on the softness and comfort you want in a good bamboo sheet. Upgrade to Cariloha's Retreat Sheets ($289) if you want a securing strap, which is handy for silky bamboo.Coyuchi Organic Crinkled Percale Sheet Set for $189: I love a few different sets from Coyuchi, but none of the ones we've tested are available on Amazon. Still, it's a good organic brand, so swinging for the crinkled percale and classic sateen ($178) will likely leave you satisfied.Cozy Earth Bamboo Sheet Set for $330: This is a big favorite in the bamboo world for the super-cozy, silky soft feel. It's unlike any other bamboo set I've tried. It's a splurge, but truly worth it if you love a cozy-soft feel and want sheets that feel cool to the touch at the same time (but warm up nicely as you sleep).Ettitude Signature Sateen Bamboo Sheets for $333: These are an impressively decorated set of bamboo sheets, with certifications from Oeko-Tex, the Forest Stewardship Council, Eco-Cert, and B-Corp. Bamboo doesn't have the same organic certifications yet that you can find on linen and cotton, but this is the closest combo you'll get. These sheets are also super soft yet still very breathable, and my favorite bamboo for hot sleepers and organic shoppers.Sheets to SkipAmazon Basics Microfiber Sheet Set for $20: We wanted to like these cheap sheets made by Amazon, but this set is a major skip. This set both felt and sounded like the paper robes you wear at the doctor's office, and our testers hardly managed sleeping on these for a single night.Coop Comphy Cool+ Sheet Set for $219: This set promises cooling properties, but I found myself waking up sweating after sleeping on these, which isn't a huge surprise after seeing they're made of nylon, polyester, and spandex, none of which are as breathable as simple linen or cotton.Rest Evercool+ Cooling Starter Sheet Set for $299: These are supposed to be cooling sheets, but I found myself waking up feeling moisture trapped around me. Whatever's in Rest's proprietary cooling fabric didn't work for me at all.Power up with unlimited access to WIRED.
