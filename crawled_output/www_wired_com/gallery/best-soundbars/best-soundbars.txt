But even the very best TVs sound awful these days. The best soundbars can fix that. You’d be surprised how much more you'll enjoy shows and movies with a soundbar or surround system hooked up to your primo panel. Explosions pop, dialog sounds far crisper, and you may even notice sonic details in your favorite films that you’ve never picked up on before. Best of all, our top pick for most people, Yamaha's SR-C30A, is pretty affordable.There's a sea of other options, but we've put the time and effort into testing dozens of models over the past few years to help you find the best soundbar at any price point. Need more help? We have a guide on how to find the perfect soundbar, with definitions of many of the terms you'll come across while shopping and detailed information about connecting your new soundbar. Be sure to read our Best Bookshelf Speakers, Best OLED TV, and Best Audiophile Gear guides for more ways to upgrade your home theater.Updated August 2025: We’ve added the LG S95AR, more in-depth information for each pick, and updated pricing throughout.Best Soundbar for Most PeopleYamahaSR-C30A$300 Amazon$300 Walmart$300 YamahaYamaha makes some of the best speakers and soundbars that you can buy, and we really like the compact nature of this bar and wireless subwoofer combo. This works great for those of us who want cinematic low end, but can't rely on an outlet right where you want to place it. It can even be placed horizontally to fit under higher-bottomed couches and chairs, or a cabinet with legs. Simple HDMI connection makes it super easy to pair with any modern TV, and it even has Bluetooth for pairing with phones, tablets, and other media players. There's easy wall mounting holes for TVs in fancier rooms, but we like that the compact, 2-foot main bar fits well on even smaller TV consoles.SpecsInputsHDMI eARC, Optical, aux inputSurround/3D Audio2.1 channels, virtual surroundWireless streamingBluetoothSmart assistantN/ADimensionsBar: 23.63 x 2.5 x 3.75 inches; Sub: 13.25 x 6.25 x 14.38 inchesBest Stand-Alone SoundbarPhotograph: Ryan WaniataKlipschFlexus Core 200$549 $470 (14% off) Amazon$550 Walmart$575 KlipschKlipsch's Flexus Core 200 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) sounds way better than it should for the money. Klipsch cut a few corners to lower the cost, namely Wi-Fi support, which leaves out streaming options like Apple AirPlay and smart assistants like Alexa. In their place, you'll get notably clear sound, up-firing drivers to provide overhead sound effects with Dolby Atmos video, and surprising gravitas up and down the frequency spectrum for a stand-alone bar.The Flexus lives up to its name with impressive versatility, including the ability to add wireless surround speakers, a wireless subwoofer, or even a third-party sub via a traditional sub output. You'll also get an app for adjusting audio settings, a handy remote, and most importantly, the satisfaction of knowing you scored great sound for far less than many competitors. —Ryan Waniata★ Sub up: Looking for something with more punch from the get-go? Yamaha's True X Bar 50A (8/10, WIRED Recommends) comes complete with a subwoofer as well as upfiring speakers for Dolby Atmos and extras like Wi-Fi streaming. It usually costs more than the Core 200 but sometimes goes on sale at similar pricing.SpecsInputsHDMI eARC, optical, USB-C (subwoofer out)Surround/3D audio3.1.2 channels, Dolby AtmosWireless streamingBluetoothSmart assistantN/ADimensions44 x 3 x 5 inchesBest Compact SoundbarPhotograph: Ryan WaniataBoseSmart Soundbar$549 $499 (9% off) Amazon$549 Walmart$549 Best Buy$549 BoseForget the tiny booze bottles in your hotel room; Bose's mini bar serves up a cocktail of musical sound and impressive features that's actually worth your money. Unlike the similarly miniature Sonos Beam Gen 2, Bose's Smart Soundbar (8/10, WIRED Recommends) employs true up-firing drivers for convincing Dolby Atmos effects alongside a surprisingly fun and engaging sound signature.The bar adds lots of extras, including Alexa voice control via built-in microphones, AI dialog mode for superb vocal clarity, and even the ability to use Bose's Open Earbuds as personal surround speakers. The midrange and treble outclass the bass, but if you need extra punch you can add a Bose Bass Module. Like Sonos bars, you can connect to other Bose speakers in multiple configurations and stream from several music services over Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, adding up to a nifty and versatile package. —Ryan WaniataSpecsInputsHDMI eARC, opticalSurround/3D Audio3.0.2 channels, Dolby AtmosWireless streamingBluetooth, Wi-Fi (Spotify Connect, AirPLay, Chromecast)Smart assistantAlexaDimensions27.34 x 2.21 x 4.09 inchesBest Budget Surround SoundbarPhotograph: AmazonVizio5.1 Soundbar SE (SV510M-0806)$198 Amazon$198 WalmartVizio soundbars have long been known to bend the basic rules of performance for your dollars, and the 5.1 Soundbar SE (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is the latest to personify this reputation. At just around $200, you're getting slick surround sound performance and impressive virtualized Dolby Atmos and DTS:X immersion in a compact bar-and-subwoofer package.The system isn't the best for music (you'd be better off with some bookshelf speakers), and there's no optical input for older TVs. Otherwise, the only real downside is the wired speakers that plug into the subwoofer, limiting placement options. That's a small concession for true surround sound at this meager price, making the Vizio 5.1 SE a great option for movie nuts on a very tight budget.SpecsInputsHDMI eARCSurround/3D Audio5.1 channels, virtual Dolby Atmos/DTS:XWireless streamingBluetoothSmart assistantN/ADimensionsBar: 33 x 2.32 x 3.23 inches; Sub: 6.59 x 7.71 x 11 inches; Surrounds: 4.92 x 2.32 x 3.23 inchesBest 5.1 Soundbar SystemPhotograph: Ryan WaniataPhotograph: Ryan WaniataPhotograph: Ryan WaniataPhotograph: Ryan WaniataChevronChevronSonyBravia Theater System 6$798 Amazon$770 Walmart$768 B&HWhen Sony first showed me the System 6 (8/10, WIRED Reviewed) at its Tokyo HQ, it seemed like an odd turn. At a time when slimmer, stand-alone soundbars with upfiring Dolby Atmos speakers and Wi-Fi connection rule the high-end soundbar market, the System 6 goes the other way. The mostly wired surround sound system feels like a Home Theater in a Box (HTB) of old, built around a hefty sub, a skinny bar, and tall rear speakers wired into a separate amplifier box.While the heft and wires make for a more involved installation, the retro-style setup soon won my heart with sweet cinematic punch, engaging detail, and fantastic immersion, including decent Dolby Atmos and DTS:X virtualization. The only real downside is updating the firmware, which is done manually instead of through the app, causing headaches during my review (I never got it to work). Otherwise, this semi-modern take on an old classic provides a thrilling sonic experience that's worth a little hassle. —Ryan WaniataSpecsInputsHDMI eARC, optical, 3.5 mmSurround/3D Audio5.1 channels, virtual Dolby Atmos/DTS:XWireless streamingBluetoothSmart assistantN/ADimensionsBar: 35.75 in x 2.63 in x 3.63 inches; Sub: 10.83 x 15.28 x 15.28 inches; Surrounds: 4.17 x 8.5 x 3.86 inchesBest Dolby Atmos SoundbarPhotograph: SamsungSamsungHW-Q990C$888 Amazon$969 WalmartSamsung's multi-speaker flagship bar has been our favorite one-box Dolby Atmos distributor for multiple generations. It's the best in its class at filling a room with musical, impactful, and immersive sound. The HW-Q990C improves on previous iterations with an upgraded subwoofer for tighter bass to go along with the same fluidly immersive audio experience that keeps Samsung at the top of the Atmos stack.The Q990's four-piece, 11.1.4-channel setup supports both Dolby Atmos and DTS:X, along with multiple top audio formats. Dual HDMI inputs let you connect a Blu-ray player or streaming device directly, and select newer Samsung TVs can connect wirelessly and use the TV speakers in concert with the bar via Samsung Q-Symphony. This bar is in its twilight days, but now that it often costs less than half its original price, we just can't quit the Q990C. Gamers will want to move up to the HW-Q990D or newer Q990F on sale, as both newer bars offer HDMI 2.1 support for plugging in game consoles directly without losing major features. Otherwise, there's no good reason to move on from the Q990C when it's this cheap. —Ryan WaniataSpecsInputsHDMI eARC, HDMI in (x2), opticalSurround/3D Audio11.1.4 channels, Dolby Atmos/DTS:XWireless streamingBluetooth, Wi-Fi (Spotify Connect, AirPlay)Smart assistantAlexaDimensionsBar: 48.5 x 2.7 x 5.4 inches; Sub: 8.7 x 16.3 x 16.1 inches; Surrounds: 5.1 x 7.93 x
5.53 inchesBest Soundbar-Subwoofer ComboPhotograph: Polk AudioPolk AudioSigna S4$449 Amazon$449 CrutchfieldVery few soundbars at this size pack the soundstage of this aging but still awesome Dolby Atmos-enabled bar from Polk (7/10, WIRED Recommends). It’s simple and easy to set up, with a basic, no-frills remote and HDMI eARC connection to plug into a modern TV. You can choose between Movie, Night, and Music modes, which serve their intended purposes well. Cinema mode works in a 3.1.2-channel Atmos configuration with dual upfiring drivers—it’s pretty room-filling! Music mode gives you a more normal stereo image. Night mode limits the subwoofer action so you don’t wake the neighbors. The reason this scores lower than other bars we've reviewed on this list? We prefer a backlit remote control, and we wish it had Wi-Fi.SpecsInputsHDMI eARC, optical,Surround/3D Audio3.1.2 channels, Dolby Atmos/DTS:XWireless streamingBluetoothSmart assistantN/ADimensionsBar: 41.2 x 3.7 x 2.4 inches; Sub: 7.9 x 12.9 x 11 inchesBest Dolby Atmos Soundbar Under $500Photograph: Ryan WaniataVizioElevate SE 5.1.2 Soundbar (SL512X-0806)$448 Amazon$448 WalmartVizio’s Elevate SE soundbar (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is the Jeep Wrangler of Atmos bars: It’s not built for luxury, but it'll get you where you wanna go. As the most austere model yet in the Elevate series, it skips features like Wi-Fi and smart assistants, offers no physical remote, and provides just one input for TV connection. What the SE lacks in extras it makes up for in sheer immersion, providing smooth and cinematic surround sound from a 5.1.2-channel setup at a very nice price.The Elevate's wireless surrounds are a pain to set up, but its stable Bluetooth app makes adjusting settings a cinch, while HDMI eARC connection lets you control volume and power with your TV remote. Like previous Elevate models, the bar's slickest trick is its dual rolling speakers that face forward for surround and stereo tracks, and spin upward to expand the soundstage with Dolby Atmos and DTS:X 3D audio formats. Otherwise, this is a barebones machine built around great Dolby Atmos punch for your money. —Ryan WaniataSpecsInputsHDMI eARC, USBSurround/3D Audio5.1.2 channels, Dolby AtmosWireless streamingBluetoothSmart assistantN/ADimensionsBar: 36 x 2.6 x 4.73 inches; Sub: 7.84 x 9.33 x 13.8 inches; Surrounds: 4.14 x 2.6 x 4.73 inchesBest Stand-Alone Dolby Atmos SoundbarPhotograph: Ryan WaniataSonosArc Ultra$1,099 Amazon$999 WalmartSonos hasn't been easy to love lately, which is why the Sonos Arc Ultra (9/10, WIRED Recommends) feels like such a triumph. A full-shod upgrade of the original Arc, it's got better clarity, bigger bass, and more immersive and precise Dolby Atmos expansion. With 14 different speakers run through Sonos' proprietary waveguides, you'll feel effects whizzing past your face with Dolby Atmos mixes and surround sound alike.Of course, the promise of Sonos is the versatility to build as you go, from a whole-home audio system to a multipiece surround setup. I built a gobsmacking system with the new Sub 4 and a pair of Era 300s (9/10, WIRED Recommends), though I did run into some oddities with the embattled Sonos app when I first connected it. Thankfully, a power cycle resolved my troubles, standing stable for weeks of testing. I'm not yet ready to call the software troubles over but it seems much better and the Ultra is unquestionably awesome, offering best-in-class performance. —Ryan WaniataSpecsInputsHDMI eARC, EthernetSurround/3D AudioFront/side-firing/upfiring drivers, Dolby AtmosWireless streamingBluetooth, Wi-Fi (AirPlay, Spotify Connect, Sonos multi-room)Smart assistantAlexa, Sonos Voice ControlDimensions46.38 x 2.95 x 4.35 inchesBest Dolby Atmos for LG TVsPhotograph: Parker HallPhotograph: Parker HallPhotograph: Parker HallChevronChevronLGS95TR$1,597 Amazon$1,500 Best BuyLG's 9.1.5-channel S95TR soundbar (8/10, WIRED Recommends) doesn't perform as well as Samsung's flagship Q990 series, but it's still one of the best performers in its class, and could be a better choice for those with newer LG TVs like the G5. Pairing the two lets you connect wirelessly, use your TV's speakers in tandem with the bar for more immersion, and control certain soundbar settings from the TV menu. It offers more ways to stream than Samsung's model, and supports gaming features like 120-Hz pass-through, but only includes one spare input. We already liked this system at its launch price, but it's especially tempting now that it's often on sale for hundreds less.SpecsInputsHDMI eARC, HDMI in, opticalSurround/3D Audio9.1.5 channels, Dolby Atmos/DTS:XWireless streamingBluetooth, Wi-Fi (Spotify Connect, AirPlay, Chromecast)Smart assistantAlexa (with separate speaker)DimensionsBar: 49.2 x 2.5 x 5.3 inches; Sub: 7.9 x 16 x 15.9 inches; Surrounds: 6.3 x 8.8 x 5.6 inchesBest Discreet Dolby Atmos SystemPhotograph: Ryan WaniataPhotograph: Ryan WaniataPhotograph: Ryan WaniataPhotograph: Ryan WaniataChevronChevronSonyBravia Theater Quad$2,698 Amazon$2,498 $2,400 (4% off) WalmartSony's Bravia Theater Quad (8/10, WIRED Recommends) isn't a soundbar so much as an incognito audio system for those who hate the fuss and form of traditional setups. The four wireless speakers (just add power outlets) blend in with your living room decor and include stand mounts for setup on consoles, tables, or walls. Sony's advanced processing lets you futz with placement options, combining digital virtualization with 16 individual drivers for the most immersive Dolby Atmos performance I've heard in an all-in-one solution.The central control box connects over HDMI eARC for playback control with your TV remote, and a spare HDMI input provides console support for advanced gaming features. It all runs smoothly via Sony's Bravia Connect app, which also assists with setup. The Quad extracts a very hefty price, including the need for a Sony subwoofer for full-throttle bass, but we've seen some recent sales that make it more approachable. If you're after transformative sound without disrupting the vibe, the Quad could be the perfect pick. —Ryan WaniataSpecsInputsHDMI eARC, HDMI 2.1 inSurround/3D Audio4.0.4 channels, Dolby Atmos/DTS:XWireless streamingBluetooth, Wi-Fi (Spotify Connect, AirPlay)Smart assistantN/ADimensions11.5 x 10.88 x 2.25 inches (x4)Best Soundbar for Those With Hearing LossPhotograph: ZVOXZVoxAccuVoice AV157$210 Amazon$210 WalmartIf you or someone you love has a hard time hearing what the voices onscreen are saying, consider this awesome little soundbar from lesser-known (but long-standing) brand Zvox.

It does this better than any soundbar I’ve tested with a similar feature.SpecsInputsOptical, 3.5mm (headphone/subwoofer out)Surround/3D AudioStereo onlyWireless streamingN/ASmart assistantN/ADimensions17 x 3.4 x 2.9 inchesA Soundbar for People Who Hate WiresPhotograph: JBLJBLBar 1300X$1,700 $1,200 (29% off) Amazon$1,789 WalmartThis Dolby Atmos JBL bar has a pretty neat party trick: detachable wireless surround speakers. Want more immersion when you're watching a show or movie in your stylishly designed space? Just pop off the two speakers on the side of the main soundbar and place them behind you as wireless surround speakers. That makes them great for people short on power outlets or those who don't want to hide cable runs to the rear of the room.This bar sounds excellent (8/10, WIRED Recommends), with some of the best Dolby Atmos immersion I have heard from a soundbar at this price. I also like that calibration will tune the sound to your room. The downside of wireless surround speakers? They need to be charged between uses (just pop them back on the soundbar between viewing sessions if you want them juiced up and out of the way). —Ryan WaniataSpecsInputsHDMI eARC, HDMI in (x2), opticalSurround/3D Audio11.1.4 channels, Dolby Atmos/DTS:XWireless streamingBluetooth, Wi-Fi (AirPlay, Chromecast, Alexa multi-room)Smart assistantAlexaDimensionsBar (with surrounds): 54.2 x 2.4 x 5.5 inches; Bar (no surrounds): 39.4 x 2.4 x 5.5 inches; Sub: 14.4 x 18.9 x 14.4 inchesA Completely Wireless Speaker SystemPhotograph: PlatinPlatinMonaco 5.1 (WiSA)$699 Amazon (5.1)$999 $679 (32% off) Amazon (Dolby Atmos 5.1.2)Five small speakers and a compact under-couch subwoofer make up this extremely easy-to-use system from Platin Audio (8/10, WIRED Recommends). It uses WiSA technology to stream and sync audio from a puck that you place near your screen or projector. It’s among the simplest surround-sound setups I’ve had the pleasure of setting up, requiring just a power source for each speaker and a single HDMI cable to plug into the puck. From there, an app and your TV’s remote control the system.This has come to be among my favorite rigs for testing because I don’t have to move anything other than an HDMI cable between devices. I also like how sleek and well-made the speakers are, with beautiful woven cones and black cases that don’t get in the way visually. You can now get the Platin Monaco system with Dolby Atmos support via rear surround speakers, a replacement pair that shoots sound effects toward the ceiling from the rear to bounce it down above your head for full immersion. I like the standard system enough to still recommend it over the Atmos option if you're on a budget, but splurge for Atmos if you have the cash.SpecsInputsHDMI eARC, optical, coaxialSurround/3D Audio5.1 channelsWireless streamingBluetoothSmart assistantN/ADimensionsCenter: 10.23 x 5.7 x 4.4 inches; Sub: 15 x 12.2 x 6.5 inches; Surrounds: 4.29 x 5.7 x 6.7 inchesHonorable MentionsPhotograph: Parker HallThere are a lot of great soundbars out there, and we don’t have room to feature them all. Here are some others you might want to consider.LG S95AR for $1,700: LG's latest 9.1.5-channel system offers minor upgrades over its predecessor, the ST95R, leaving few reasons to upgrade at full price. It's among the top performers in its class, offering impressive clarity, swift and fluid immersion, and snappy setup and control with LG's continuously improving ThinQ app. It's a solid value compared to competing multi-piece Dolby Atmos systems at full price, and it will get increasingly tempting as the price drops.Sony Bravia Theater 9 for $1,400: Sony’s follow-up to the potent HT-A7000 flagship soundbar regresses in some key ways. There are fewer inputs (no more analog), a more mundane fabric-wrapped design, and minimal sound settings. The Theater 9's leaner frame equates to a less meaty and immersive soundstage, but this is still a Sony flagship soundbar, which means great musicality, superb detail, and advanced spatial imaging for 3D audio. Premium features like an HDMI 2.1 input for connecting modern game consoles and advanced integration with newer Sony TVs sweeten the deal, but at $1,400, it’s a pricey proposition.Vizio 2.1 Soundbar (SV210M) for $170: Vizio’s curvy little combo brings enticing value, with solid sound quality and some cinematic punch from the teensiest subwoofer you’ll ever see. There’s no optical input or remote included, but the Vizio app makes adjusting settings or swapping to Bluetooth simple enough. The main drawback is that dialog sometimes (but not always) gets lost, reducing the main draw of a cheap soundbar. That said, good musical chops and features like DTS Virtual X expansion make it worth considering on sale.Samsung HW-Q800C for $600-700: If Samsung's HW-Q990 everything bar is too rich for your blood, the two-piece HW-Q800C (8/10, WIRED Recommends) could be a good compromise. This bar offers a similar sound signature as Samsung's flagship bars and many of the same features, packed into a smaller bar-and-subwoofer combo for a notable discount–especially since it's now almost always on sale.Sennheiser Ambeo Mini for $800: This pint-sized luxury bar is great for those with money to burn in very small spaces. Sennheiser's built-in Ambeo virtualization technology brilliantly throws sound all around you for exhilarating TV shows and movies, and offers advanced features like support for Google Assistant and Alexa.The Polk React for $134: This soundbar works if you want to get surround sound eventually but don’t have the cash right now. The Alexa-enabled soundbar is fine on its own, with surround speakers and subwoofers available from Polk if you want to upgrade.How to Connect Your SoundbarAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWe’ve included a list of available connectivity options next to every soundbar on our list. Most soundbars will connect to your TV via optical or HDMI cables, though the optical input is starting to go away for newer models, including even pricey flagship options. In most cases, HMDI is the preferable connection anyway.If your TV and soundbar both have an HDMI ARC/eARC port (the cable port looks like regular HDMI, but it’s labeled ARC or eARC), connect it that way. It will allow you to use the volume buttons on your TV remote to control the soundbar’s volume. Also, make sure CEC is enabled. Use an optical cable only if HDMI isn’t available, as HDMI is also necessary for Dolby Atmos and other 3D audio formats.Finally, check your TV audio menus to make sure your TV’s internal speakers are set to off (so you don’t get any weird audio fluttering) and find the best spots to place your speakers and sub.Why You Need a SoundbarAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWe have yet to test a new TV that didn’t sound better with an audio accessory. That’s mostly due to the way televisions are designed. Great-sounding speakers are bulky, and as TVs have gotten thinner with shrinking bezels and sleeker designs, manufacturers have had a harder time building good speakers into them.You can spend as little as $100 to $150 on a new soundbar, and it’s essential to getting the most out of your TV experience. Our list of the top soundbars we’ve tested includes soundbars sold on their own and models that come bundled with a subwoofer and surround speakers at a wide variety of price points.Are Soundbars as Good as Speakers?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronStumble onto any A/V or home theater subreddit or forum and you’ll see a mob of people claiming even the idea of a soundbar matching up to a pair of speakers is heresy. The truth, as far as we’re concerned, is that it all depends on your individual wants and needs.If you’re looking for the most musical bang for your buck, especially when it comes to hi-res audio and vinyl record collections, a great pair of bookshelf speakers is likely your best value option. Even if you’re not keen on shopping for an amp and running speaker wires, our best bookshelf speakers guide offers plenty of powered/active pairs that include all the inputs and amplification built-in, like a soundbar system for audiophiles.That may not be the best option for everybody, though. If you’re just after something cheap and simple to soup up your TV sound, or conversely, a convenient way to explore exciting audio formats like surround sound and Dolby Atmos, a soundbar could be the perfect choice. Soundbars are affordable and hassle-free solutions, many of which offer sound and features that may match your needs better than a pair of speakers or a traditional home theater setup. We take no sides here, we just love good sound and great features. For many, a soundbar is the best way to get there.Do You Need a Subwoofer?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronThis is a question only you can answer, but there are a few points to consider before making a call, starting with your living space. If you live in a smaller apartment or multiplex, a subwoofer may not be the best choice due to both its size and its likelihood of arousing noise complaints. Larger modern soundbars have gotten increasingly good at reproducing convincing bass from a single bar, often utilizing multiple speakers in concert to bring more punch to lower frequencies without causing lots of boom and bombast.If you're less concerned about close quarters and looking for more cinematic punch, you should highly consider a soundbar with a subwoofer. Physics can only be stretched so far, and no multi-speaker system we’ve heard can match the punch and potency of a dedicated large driver and acoustic cabinet. Even many affordable soundbar models include a subwoofer. If you want full-throttle sound, we suggest considering going all in for a subwoofer, or at the very least a bar that allows you to add one later.Power up with unlimited access to WIRED.
