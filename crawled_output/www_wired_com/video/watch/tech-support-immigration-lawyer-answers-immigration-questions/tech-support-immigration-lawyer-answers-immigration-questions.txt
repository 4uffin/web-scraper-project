Assistant Editor: Justin SymondsReleased on 09/16/2025TranscriptI'm Charles Kuck, law professor and immigration lawyer.I'm here today to answer your questions from the internet.This is immigration support.[upbeat music]This is a question from @DzambhalaHODL.Okay, I realize I don't understand the differencebetween a visa, a green card, a refugee,or an asylum seeker.A visa is actually a stampthat a consular officer at a US consulateputs in a foreign national's passportto allow them to come to the United Statesand apply for entry at the airport or at a border.For a visa, there's many different bases.For example, you can get a visa to visit the United States.You can get a work visa.Overall, there's 24 different types of visasto just come here temporarily,as well as an additional 30 immigrant visasto immigrate to the United States.A green card is actually evidenceof somebody's permanent residence in the United States,they call it a green card'cause it's green, kind of looks like a driver's license.A refugee is an individual who is outside the United Stateswho goes through about a two year vetting processand ultimately can become a permanent resident.That refugee has to showthat they've been persecuted in some way abroad.An asylum seeker on the other hand,is someone who is in the United States,either with or without a visaor who comes to the border and asks to apply for asylum.They have to show to an immigration judgeor the immigration officials that they have a fearof persecution in their home countrybecause of their race, their religion, their nationality,their political opinion,or because they're a member of a social group, for example,because they're gay or they're lesbian.This question's from u/cooldude010.How hard is it to legally immigrateto the United States from the Mexican borderif you are not a citizen?It's basically impossible.If you just show up at the border,you have no legal right to remain in the United States,nor do you have a legal right to immigrateto the United States unless you are applying for asylumand even then you're likely to be detainedand at that point you will have to show an immigration judgethat you have this fear of persecutionof returning to your home country.These types of decisions usually take months,if not a couple of years to adjudicateduring which time you might be detained.This question is from u/jsanchez030.Why are Americans who live overseas called expats,but everyone else who does the same as called an immigrant?Expats is simply a term used by corporate Americaas they send US workers abroad for temporary assignments.Generally speaking, if somebody stays in that country,they become immigrants to that country.There are people on expat contracts to the United States.You just never hear about that.This question from u/Ra21red.In this day and age,can you still marry someone for a green card?I tell individuals when they come to meet with me,you have to fall in love first.It's not just,Hey, I'm gonna go find somebody to get married,that's called marriage fraudand that is quite illegal in the United States,so the US Immigration Service pays a lot of attentionto marriage cases, especially when the couple looks likethey don't really belong together.Somebody marries someone from another countryand they don't speak each other's languages,at that point, the Immigration Service may have questionsabout whether this is a real marriage.Generally speaking, when you marry a US citizenand you are approved for a green cardor permanent residence, you're only approved for two years.At the end of those two years,you have to go back to the immigration serviceand prove that you physically live together.Immigration requires, generally speaking,co-mingling of assets,shared bank account statements, for example,living in the same locationwith the lease in both your names.Immigration has an entire task force of menand women who go outand check whether this documentation is real,and I will tell you,they do find people who try to scam this system.Do some people get away with it? Absolutely.Do most people get away with it? Absolutely not.I love this question from @DirkLosman.Where do Americans immigrate to?Did you know that today there are over a million Americansliving in Mexico.It's the highest source country for receiving Americans.You can go anywhere in the worldand you will find a, quote, expat community.There's been a large increase in the number of Americansleaving the country since Donald Trump became presidentthe second time.A lot of other countries are welcoming Americans generallybecause Americans have money, Americans create jobs,Americans have experience that maybe their countries lack.This question from u/RelativeIncrease2215.H1B laid off. What are my options?An H-1B is a work visa sponsored by a US employerfor a foreign national.Under our current immigration laws,when an individual who has an H-1B is firedor quits their job, they have a 60 day grace periodin which to leave the United States,change their status to visitor or file a new employer H-1Bif they wanna remain here,if they don't leave before the end of the 60 days,they'll be put into deportation proceedingsand ultimately deported from the United States.This question is from u/Mammoth_Mastodon_294.Can Trump take away green cardsor make it more difficult than current?Yes, permanent residentscan actually lose their permanent residenceunder a variety of circumstances.For example, if they're convicted of a crimewithin five years of getting their green card,they can be put into deportation proceedingsand their residents can be taken away.If they stay outside the countrylonger than 180 days a year,their green card can be taken away.The other reason that you see today in the newsis individuals who may have misrepresented themselvesto get permanent residenceor they didn't fill out the forms truthfully,in that circumstance, their residence can be taken away.Nothing is secure until you are a US citizen.There are circumstances under which citizenshipcan be revoked.Generally it's because you have liedon your citizenship application.There is a specific questionthat most people kind of laugh atthat is all in the application.Have you committed a crimefor which you have not been arrested?If you have committed a crimefor which you have not been arrestedand you're subsequently arrested,they can use that as a basis to take your citizenship away.This question is from u/EOFFJIM, and I love this question.Is Trump's gold card for $5 million a good or a bad idea?If you're asking people that wanna buy residencefor $5 million, it's probably a good idea,but it's likely a bad idea for everybody else.We have a visa called the EB-5 immigrant visa.This allows individualsto invest $1 billion in a business in the United Statesand create 10 jobs through that investment.That person gets a conditional green card,good for two years,so the program already exists since 1990 individualshave invested this amount of money into the countrycreating hundreds of thousands of jobs.Why you'd want to pay more for it? I don't know.Europe and other countriesaround the world have created a golden visa.Portugal has brought in thousands of individualswilling to invest somewhere in the neighborhood of 300,000to $500,000 and obtained residentsand quickly they obtained citizenshipwithin about three years.This question from @RedSmil61893898.What jobs do immigrants take from Americans?They don't take any jobs from Americans.America is not just a pie that's this big.America is a pie that grows every time somebody elsecomes to the United States.Now, immigrants do jump jobs that Americans will not do.Everybody acknowledges this.There are very few Americans with childrenwho tell their children,Bobby, you should drop outta schooland go pluck chickens at the chicken factory.We're constantly telling our children to get skilled jobs,to go to college, to go to trade school.We're not telling to do unskilled jobs,which we still have a need for in the United States.There are likely salaries at which you could pay individualsto do these very difficult jobs,but then you'd have to sell the productof those jobs at prices that nobody would buy that product,by a continual supply of immigrants to the United Statesyou enable us to grow our economyand at the same time allow jobsthat would likely be outsourced to other countriesto remain in the United States.Silicon Valley is, for example, a great example of this.49% of the companies started up in Silicon Valleyin the last 30 years have been started up by immigrants,people who bringing their ideas to a countrywhere those ideas can be put into action.This question is from @Loonatic24.How much do immigrants contribute to the USA GDP?Immigrants generally are younger,so virtually all immigrants in America todayactually work in jobs.That's true whether they're undocumented or documented.The undocumented population are not getting welfare,they're not getting benefits.They're not using free healthcare.They're working every day in jobs that Americans won't do.A lot of people complain about immigrantsthat have come to the border illegally,but why are these individuals comingto the border illegally?Nobody invited them to come except we did,and I'm not talking about politicians.I'm talking about our economy.Our economy has invited people to come.Now that has been cut off in this administration,so you're seeing far fewer people come to the borderbecause they don't feel invited anymore.Today, if we were to deport allof the undocumented in the United States,we would go into an instant recessionbecause we have nobodyto backfill those jobs in the United States.So this ideathat immigrants are a drag on our economyis one of the greatest falsehoods that exist,in fact, they're a boom to our economy.This question is from @Kram_Della_Kram.Why are immigrants more likely to start a businessthan that of the domestic population?I am a living example of that.My own grandparents came from farms in Germanyduring the depression.What did they do as soon as they got here?They created businesses.They saw opportunitybecause they can employ themselves,they can open up a little store.Immigrants do this because they're driven,lazy people do not walk across the desert.That's why immigrants are more likely to create businesses.This question from an @AnAimlessJoy.What is chain immigration?I see people talking about it a lot.Chain immigration is a derogatory termput on family-based immigration by anti-immigrationand nativist activists in the United States.The chain is this.You immigrate to America through your job for example,when you become a citizen,you can sponsor your parent to come to the United States.You can also sponsor a childor sibling to come to the United Statesand they can sponsor their parent,hence the quote chain immigration.Regular people call it family-based immigrationand family immigration has been the core immigrationto the United States since 1952.Over 70% of our visas every year are family-based visas.This question from @adrianbosco.What is the crime rate of illegal immigrantscompared to the general population?Interesting question because the data is very sparseand until recently,only one state actually tracked that data,the great state of Texas,whenever they arrest anyone,they find out their immigration statusand they publish those records online for the world to see.Undocumented immigrants commit crimes at a much lower ratethan US citizens.Why is that, well, if you're undocumented,you don't commit crime because you know you'll be caughtand sent back to your home countrydespite what you see on the ICE Twitter feed every day,undocumented immigrants are generally law abiding,they have strong families,they go to church on Sundays, many own businesses.This question from @mmbrenn.Do illegal immigrants vote in the United States?No, because they can't vote.Undocumented immigrants, no, they can't vote.In federal elections, only US citizens can vote,in state elections, only US citizens can vote.Sometimes in municipalities,they allow every person resident in that municipalityto vote but for the most part,you have to be a US citizen to vote in the United States,under President Bill Clintonwe created a law called Motor Voter,when you applied for a licensethey registered the vote.Frequently in the 90sand the early 2000s they registered everybodywho got a license, including individuals at the timewho were immigrants to the United States,did a couple of those vote, yeah.Every year you're talking about in the entire country,fewer than a couple of dozen people vote illegally,we're constantly in search of a solution to a problemthat doesn't exist on illegal voting.This question from @joshieyamaguchi.Where's Anna Delvey?Better question, who's Anna Delvey?Anna Delvey is from Inventing Anna fame.She had defrauded a number of individualshere in New York claiming to be a German princessof some kind.Ultimately, she was convictedand served time in state prisonand was picked up by ICE at the end of her sentence.She was ordered deported by an immigration judge,but she hired a really good lawyer, me,and we were able to overturn her deportation decisionon appeal.She currently awaits a new decision from immigration judge,not in ICE custody.She was secured release and is living in her apartment.She's currently under ICE detention with an ankle monitorand occasionally you see her on television.Good luck, Anna.This question from @kdoright.Can ICE arrest people without a warrant,and if so, if they're not wearing a uniform, a badge,or an ID, how are people supposed to trust them?ICE can arrest individuals without a warrantwithin a 100 mile zone around the entire United States.This includes 70% of the US population.So if you're in New York City,an ICE officer walks up to you on the street and says,Show me your papers, entirely legal for them to do that.They also don't need a warrant to arrest someonewho they can positively identify as being in violationof US immigration law.Now, they do need a warrant to enter a homeunless they're in active pursuit of an individual.Now, you're seeing today a lot of videosof ICE officers out there with no IDor ID that misstates who they are, the police,ICE is not the police,or refusing to identify themselvesas they arrest individuals,but until you have an administrationthat enforces requirements that they wear uniformsand identify themselves, you will see this continueuntil Americans get tired of it.There are a number of US citizens that have been arrestedbecause they look foreign,either they don't speak English very wellor they don't have papers with them,in parts of the United Stateswhere that is outside the 100 mile zone,what ICE can do is they can surveil locations.For example, an apartment complex,mostly populated by immigrants.ICE walks around on their phones with an app,with the photos of anyone who's ever given their phototo many DMVs, passports and immigration.If you come up as somebody in their phoneknown to be undocumented,they will just arrest you without you saying anything.But our advice as lawyers, as you simply remain quiet,if you're not under arrest, you ask, Am I being detained,I'm not being detained, walk slowly away.If they say they're detaining you, you are under arrestand then you say, I'm not speaking without a lawyer.Don't resist arrest.Don't run away, but you have no obligation to talk to them.ICE did in January revoke guidancethat prohibited them from going to places like schoolsand churches and hospitals.They're not going to those places generally speakingbecause there was a lot of pushbackand a lot of litigation that was mostly filedagainst the Trump administrationfor revoking those policies.But they are arresting people outside of schoolsso people just don't send their kids to school.This question from @B1llyHossness.What is inhumane about ICE deportations?How are they different from Obama's 3 million?Deporting people has been part of our immigration laws.At the same time,the conditions under which individuals are heldand the places to which they are sentare inhumane in some circumstances.For example, sending an individual from Vietnamor Cambodia who cannot be deported to their home country,to Sudan, a country in the middle of a civil war,that is inhumanebecause this is done to punish people in waysthat a regular deportation,which is terrible for many people, does not do.Obama is known in the Latino communityas the Deporter In Chief,he deported more people than Trump could ever hope to deportbecause he was first of all in for eight years.But they can't deport people very fastbecause even immigrants are entitled to due process.That means they're entitled to go in frontof an immigration judgeand present their case for staying in the United States.The Obama administration weaponized the immigration lawsby deputizing sheriffs around the United Stateswho detain people for traffic violations.They would detain themand then Obama's ICE would arrest them.Keeping people in these immigration facilities,which are not prisons, they are worse.These are holding facilitieswith nothing but three crummy meals a daygenerally under very terrible conditions,and people who are stuck there for 3, 4, 5 monthseventually give up.That's what Obama was successful atand what Trump is trying to repeatwith places like Alligator Alcatraz and Speedway.They're trying to make it so bad for peoplethey will just give up their due process rights and leave.This question from @contempathy916.Are legal immigrants being deported?Absolutely, they're being deported.Legal immigrants are individualswho are in the United States on work visas or travel visasafter they go through a process.Now there's different processes depending on where you are.If you show up at an airportand you have a permanent resident or a green card,but you've been gone for a year,these officers will generally threaten individualsand say, You've been gone too long,I'm taking your green card away and sending you away,if you wanna fight this, I'm gonna keep you in jail.No permanent resident who's legal wants to stay in jailso they turn around and go away.Or individuals in the United States,legal permanent residentswho it has found out obtain their residence unlawfullyor who commit a crime,they're absolutely being put into deportation proceedingsand being deported, can they ultimately be deported?Federal courts are rulingagainst the Trump administration on thisand saying, Look, the First Amendmenttrumps the immigration laws.Residents have rights including First Amendment rightsin the United States.Question here from u/Sad_Analyst_4470.Should someone show up to court and risk deportation?This question really focused on the reportsthat we're seeing of ICE officers in the hallwaysof immigration court arresting peopleafter they come out of their immigration court hearing.In 1996, while Bill Clinton was president, he signed a lawthat said, Anyone who's in the United Statesless than two years can be deported without a trial.This is called expedited removal.These people show up in immigration court'cause they have a pending asylum case.ICE lawyers are telling the judge,Judge, we no longer wanna pursue this person's deportation,we wanna cancel the case.So the person walks out thinking for some reason,not understanding why their case is canceled,and then they encounter the ICE officer outsidewho has their name on a sheet and has their pictureand says, Oh, we're here to arrest you'cause your case was terminated,and then haul 'em downstairs in the buildingand off to ICE detention center.If that's gonna happen to you,should you show up for your deportation hearing?As a lawyer, I have to tell you,you have to show up for your hearing,but are people not showing up for their hearing?Absolutely.Failures to appear are skyrocketing in immigration courtsbecause what's worse,not showing up for your court hearingand getting a deportation orderor showing up to your court hearing and being arrested?This question from u/throwaway 102013.What should you do if you are a US citizenand get deported by ICE?One, you should call your familyand have them talk to reporters right away'cause you need to get press on this issue right away.Press solves problems.Has this happened? Absolutely it's happened.There have been US citizensdeported from the United States by accident.What they need to do is go to the US Embassyin whatever country they were deported toand say, I'm a US citizen,here's proof of my US citizenship.If you don't have your passport, which you likely don't,they will give you a travel documentto return United States.That will not happen overnight.That will likely take weeks,but that absolutely happens todayand will continue to happen under the Trump administration.This question from r/AskAnAmerican.How dangerous is it really crossing the border?Our side of the border in all the cities like El Paso,San Diego, Brownsville, very safe.On the Mexican side of the border,that opposite side is dangerous, it is run by gangs.There's extortion, there's rape.People die crossing the bordereither because of drowning along the Texas borderor die in the desert of thirst crossing the Arizonaand California deserts.I would not recommend it to anybody.It's just very, very dangerous.Question from @yaafacomadre.So if I get deported, what happens to my debt?Nothing happens to your debt. It's still your debt.If you're able to come back one day,that debt will still be there.Likely that debt is tied to a social security number,which you will always have even if you come back legally20 years from now, sorry.This question from u/mtmag@dev52.Thoughts on the differences between Jus Soliand Jus Sanguinius bases for citizenship and nationality,or how they are misused by modern politicians?What do you think is the best form of citizenship?Jus Soli means citizenship is basedon where you are born,and Jus Sanguinius is citizenship based on blood or family.The United States has a system based on both.If you are born in the United States, you are a US citizen.Unless your parent is a diplomat,maybe you don't like that idea.I personally think it's a good ideabecause it establishes continuity.There are a number of countries around the world,mainly in the Middle Eastwhere if you're born there, you're not a citizen.So there are workers, three generations old in Saudi Arabia.Their parents were born there, they were born there,they are not Saudi.If they leave for six months, they can't go back,which creates stateless people, which creates refugees,which creates broader problems around the world.Oh, this is a great question.This question from u/NoEggNoPlan.What would revoking birthright citizenship look like?First of all, you could not do it retroactively.What Trump has done is revoke it going forward,saying, As of originally February,anybody born in the United Stateswhose parents weren't citizens or permanent residents,even if their parents were legally here are not citizensof the United States,what would that look like going forward?Creating an entire class of stateless individuals.Our immigration laws don't let those kidssponsor those parents until those parentsare out of the country for 10 yearsso the parents aren't getting any benefitout of their kids being born herethat is any way immediate'cause you can't even sponsor your parents till you're 21.At the same time, what are you gonna tell the kid?The kid's not going anywhere now they won't have papers.Are you gonna make them a resident?Are you gonna give them a visa?What are you gonna do for those kids?This is a terrible idea whose time I hope will never come.This question from u/Arktikos02.How would you define the differencebetween assimilation and integration?Assimilation is an individual who adopts the mannerismsand the culture of the society in which we come.Integration is just being partof the society of the economy.It's not necessarily adopting every characteristicof that society.There's a lot of complaint in 2025that immigrants don't assimilate.This is simply not true.If you're looking for immigrants the day they get hereto start having barbecue in their backyard with hot dogsand hamburgers and abandon their culturethat they grew up withand live with for a big part of their lives,you would be going against the entire cultural historyof the United States, and it's not like you come to Americaand are sworn in as a citizenand we say, Hey, here's all these classesto teach you to be American.Immigrants come to Americaand they integrate into our economy through jobs.They integrate into our schools through their kids,whether their own education, but assimilation takes time.Sometimes it takes a generationand if you wanna help people start a class in your areato teach them English, start a culture class,do things to help them assimilate.I remember as a child in the 1960sgoing with my grandparents to German social hallswhere individuals only spoke German, played German music,had German food.Those social halls do not exist today, assimilation.And Quora User asks,What happens to all the paper forms you fill outfor immigration and customs?I'm sorry I'm laughing 'cause yes,they're still using paper.Now, USCIS, which is the Immigration Service Agencythat runs and deals with most of the visasand green cards and citizenship,they are moving towards an online filing system,but there are still billionsof paper records in immigration vaults around the world.ICE on the other hand, ICE is all paperand it's a paper nightmare,is actually causing problems for the Trump administration'cause they can't get the paper process fast enoughto get people into removal proceedings,in respect to data protection in filing paper forms,probably the least protected form of datais a piece of paper which can be copied or photographedand sent around the world.The USCIS actually has a very robustonline filing system that is protectedby several different layersand likely complies with every governmental standardaround the world for protection of data.It'd be much better for them to move more quicklyto online data filing,but the reality is they simply don't havethe physical capability of doing that yet.As a follow-up question from @Phonex2717.Can you explain what an F1 visa is and can it be revoked?Well, we just saw a mass revocationby the Trump administration in Marchand April of this year of a numberof F1 visa holders actively studying the United States.The Trump administration ran all 1.4 million studentswho are here in the United States through the NCICto see if they'd ever been arrested for anything,and approximately 6,000 fingerprint hits came back.The Trump administration sent out notices,Hey, we're revoking your visabecause you showed up in the hit.The problem was, and I don't know if you know this or not,but the police do arrest innocent peopleand the vast majority of these individualshad no convictionsand thus no legitimate basis to have their visas revoked.Lawyers in more than 200 lawsuitsaround the country in April, including myselfand our firm were able to reinstate these studentsand get their status put back into place.We are now litigating the actual visa revocationin federal court in Washington DC for these students.Visas can also be revoked if you are convicted of a crime,if you get bad grades, if you take too few classes,all those are reasons to revoke a student visain the United States.This question from u/Budabing.What were the main reasonsfor the age of mass migration from 1850 to the mid 1900s?And we can answer it with this chart.In 1850, we were coming up on the Civil Warin the United States.At the time, there were approximately 2.4 million immigrantsin the United States, 10% of the US population,starting in 1865 shortly after the Civil War,our population increased to more than 15%of immigration doubling during that timeframein actual population, for the next 40 years,immigration continued at a very rapid pace.In 1924, our Congress passed lawsthat limited legal immigrationto the United States from everywhere in the worldother than Western Europe.What happened after 1924 up until 1965 isthat the percentage of immigrants in America went down.There were no immigrants comingand we went down to about 5%,but since 1965 with the passage of the Immigration Actand the restoration of worldwide immigrationto United States our numbers of immigrant populationhas increased dramaticallywhile we have many more immigrants in America todaythan we did in 1860,we have many more people in the United States as well,such that today the percentage of populationis basically a little bit less than it was in 1860,even though we have many more immigrants in America.This next question is from u/AppropriateDebt9.How were previous immigration peaks perceivedat the time in the United States?People who lived in the United States as Americans in 1910to 1924 had the same reaction as we're having today.An anti-immigration fervorbecause people are generally afraid of things that are newand when they see signs in Chinese going upor people in school speaking Spanish to their kids,they get afraid of that.This is human natureand it's something that America has typically overcomeafter a period of time.Hopefully, we've learned from our historyand we'll overcome that more quickly today.This question is from @chicojuanito395.How do undocumented immigrants pay taxes?I would gladly hire undocumented,which by the way would be a crime,but everybody else pays taxesso you're not getting away with not paying.If you have work authorization documentsthat really isn't undocumented, right?Somebody explained like I'm five.First of all, undocumented immigrants pay billionsof dollars in taxes every year in the United States,not just through income taxbecause they do pay income taxes with a taxes ID number.These individuals do pay taxes as well on their food.They pay taxes on their rent. They pay property taxes.They pay taxes just like Americans doat every level of society.So undocumented immigrants are not getting awaywith not paying taxes.And finally,if somebody does have work authorization document,that means they have the ability to workand have a social security number and you can hire themand they will pay taxes.Our next question is from @DonovanVice.What if we just stopped immigration for a yearand saw what happened, see how things go,and then we can decide the right balance.Why would that be so terrible?Ask the guy in love with the British womanif he could just wait a couple years to bring her over.Ask the employer who wants to bring in the lead scientiston his project to create thousands of jobs for his company.Ask the family who wants to bring dad to the United Statesso they can take care of him as he enters Alzheimer's.The reality is we need immigrationand we need it every year.We need to grow our countryto remain competitive around the world.You cut that offand it'll be like cutting off your nose to spite your face.Hopefully our politicians in 2025will continue to understand that.That's all the questions for today, until next time.[upbeat music]Up NextGordon Ramsay Answers Cooking Questions From TwitterKen Jeong Answers Medical Questions From TwitterBill Nye Answers Science Questions From TwitterBlizzard's Jeff Kaplan Answers Overwatch Questions From TwitterNick Offerman Answers Woodworking Questions From TwitterBungie's Luke Smith Answers Destiny Questions From TwitterJackie Chan & Olivia Munn Answer Martial Arts Questions From TwitterScott Kelly Answers Astronaut Questions From TwitterLaVar Ball Answers Basketball Questions From TwitterDillon Francis Answers DJ Questions From TwitterTony Hawk Answers Skateboarding Questions From TwitterJerry Rice Answers Football Questions From TwitterGarry Kasparov Answers Chess Questions From TwitterU.S. Olympic and Paralympic Athletes Answer Olympics Questions From TwitterNeuroscientist Anil Seth Answers Neuroscience Questions From Twitter
