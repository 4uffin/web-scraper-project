Assistant Editor: Billy WardReleased on 08/12/2025TranscriptI'm Alex Wellerstein.I'm a nuclear historian.I'm here today to answer your questions from the internet.This is Nuclear History Support.[upbeat music]All right, first up, we have one from @AmericanVsGov.What countries have nukes?There are nine countries today in the worldwith nuclear weapons that we know about.The United States, first country that got them.The Soviet Union got them in 1949.Today, those nuclear weapons are in the handsof the Russian Federation.The United Kingdom, People's Republic of China, France.These are the five officially allowed countriesunder the nuclear non-proliferation treatyto have nuclear weapons.There is also Israel, India, Pakistan, and North Korea,so nine countries total.There were a few countries that inherited nuclear weaponsafter the fall of the Soviet Union,Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan,but they returned all of those weaponsto Russia in an agreement.LJWhitman1, asks, Who decides which countriescan have nukes and which countries can't?What are their criteria?The decision about who can quote, unquote, have nukesand who quote, unquote, can't,this is the result of a treaty,the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty,which was created in 1968to try and slow the spread of nuclear weapons.If you sign the treaty, you agree that only five countries,the countries that had tested nuclear weapons by 1967,are allowed to have nuclear weapons.Anybody else is not allowed under that treaty.So if you sign that treaty,you agree those are the only five that have nuclear weaponsand nobody else should have.Pakistan, India, and Israel never signed the treaty,have developed their own nuclear weapons.There's also North Korea, which was a member of the treaty,but then left the treaty and made nuclear weapons.Is it illegal for them to have nuclear weapons?Only in the sense that they're not members of the treaty.What the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty doesis it allows any country without nuclear weaponsto know that anybody else who signed the treatyis probably not also trying to get nuclear weapons.So if you're worried that your rival across the waymight be getting nukes,if you and they both signed the treaty,then you're not going to have to worry as muchabout them getting the weapons.It also gives them accessto peaceful nuclear technology like nuclear reactors.It means that they have the rightto work on that kind of stuffwithout worrying that somebody's gonna tryand, you know, blow up their reactorout of fear that it's a nuclear bomb.zipthwung asks, Was Iran building a bomb?If so, how close to a bomb was Iran?How were the nuclear talks goingbefore Israel preemptively attacked?Great question. Was Iran building a nuclear weapon?No, I don't think anybody thinks Iranwas actively building a nuclear weapon.The accusation, made particularly by Israel,is that Iran was setting up the conditionsunder which it could build a nuclear weaponvery quickly if it wanted to.Iran did have a nuclear weapons program before 2003,and the Iran deal was them essentially saying,We're gonna close downand disable all the little things we were doingthat were bad and we won't do them anymore.Once the United States left the Iran deal,Iran has been creeping up beyond the limits of the deal.You know, depending on what your stance is,you either think that's becausethey are trying to get ready to make a bomb,or because they're trying to compel the United Statesto come back to the negotiation table as a way of saying,Look, if you leave this deal, which we did,we can do this now,and if you want us to stop, come back to the deal.Now, how are the nuclear talks going?I don't think that great.I don't think it's clear exactly what Iran wants, per se.They're sort of leaving the door open for different options,which would make a lot of sensegiven the recent history that they've hadwith the United States and with Israel,but they were not, you know, racing to make a bomb.hellherekitten asks, WTF is a nuclear football?It's basically a suitcase.What the nuclear football is meant to dois allow the president of the United Statesto order a nuclear strikeeven if they are not in the White House or the Pentagon.If the president is visiting some other countryor some other city, they have basicallya very burly, usually, military personcarrying a very heavy suitcase around.And in that suitcase,there are information about nuclear war plans.There are some communication tools probablyto allow the presidentto easily link up with top generals and advisorsand whatever is neededto authenticate the president's nuclear war orderif the president decides to make that.Sophikkelson asks, Once in a while,I think about how many nukes the US has lost.How tf do you lose a nuke?Find them now.There are a number of quote, unquote, lost nuclear weapons,and what that really means is there is a nuclear weaponthat was on say, an airplane or a submarine,and that airplane either crashed or the submarine sunk,and the weapon is now in the environment, in the world.These kinds of accidentswere not super uncommon during the Cold War.The United States had a program in the 1950s and 1960sto basically have airplanes with nuclear weaponsflying in the air 24 hours a day, seven days a week,so that if nuclear war started,they could have some kind of guaranteethat they'd have a plane ready to retaliate no matter what.Same thing with submarines.They still go aroundwith nuclear weapons on them all the time.If you have thousands of airplanesflying tens of thousands of flight hours,you're gonna have an accident every once in a while.Some of these accidents have resultedin like the weapon either itself falling out of the plane,or in the case of a submarine,just going down to the bottom of the ocean.Any kind of mishap you can imagine,a lot of them have happened.In most cases, of course, the United Statesis very interested in recovering those weapons,both because it's, you know, not a good lookto have lost nuclear weapons,but also they contain the fuel you might needto make more nuclear weaponsand you don't want that falling in the wrong hands.And so the US always tried to recover these things,but sometimes the warhead sunk so deep undergroundthat after weeks of trying to dig it out,they couldn't get it or it's at the bottom of the oceanand they couldn't find it.They're lost in the sense that the US can't recover them,not that they don't know, more or less, where they are,and they're lost in the sensethat the US couldn't recover themand thinks nobody else could either,and decided to sort of cut their lossesand, you know, maybe they put a monument that says,Don't dig here.But they concludedthat if the army couldn't dig this thing up,nobody else could either.Matilda_Mother_67 asks,Why did the United States bomb Hiroshima and Nagasakiinstead of some military headquartersor other places where civilians weren't?There were a lot of processes and meetingsand decisions made along the wayabout what this bomb was, how it should work,what it would be used against.At the beginning of making the bomb, like say 1943,the attitude was, We'll probably use thisagainst some sort of military installation.The first target they even discussedwas basically the Japanese equivalent of Pearl Harbor,it's called Truk.And sure, there would be some civilians there,but it's not dropping it in the middle of a city.By 1945, 2 years later,one, Truk is not an issue militarily anymore.They had cut it off. It was not a target.And two, the United States had gotten in the habitof targeting cities.In the early part of 1945, the United Statesbegan firebombing Japanese cities with napalm.They burnt Tokyo, they burnt Osaka.They ended up burning 67 Japanese citiesby dropping basically flaming gasoline on them.The other issue is that the bomb they ended up withwas one that would work bestif you detonated it pretty high in the air.If you detonate it high in the air,you spread the blast damage out wider,but your blast damage is also less intense.So if your target is some built-up bunker,you're not gonna destroy itby blowing up the bomb in the air.If your target is a house,you don't need as much blast pressure to destroy it.So they had a bomb that they ended up with,through technical decisions along the way,that would be most impressive if you used it on a city.And they had many discussions about what kind of target,what's the goal of this weapon.The goal of the weapon was essentially psychological.They wanted to cause the Japanese peopleto say, We cannot tolerate this.We cannot win. Let's surrender.One of the people involved in the discussionsaid that the goal was to have the Japanesebasically capitulate to the power of the universe.Oh, you don't wanna surrender to the United Statesor the Soviet Union?Well what if we use the power of the sun to destroy you?To me, the really interesting thing is that Hiroshimawas not their first choice at all for a target.The first choice that the military had was Kyoto,former capital of Japan.It was taken off the list by the Secretary of War,Henry Stimson, because he thoughtthat the city was too civilian in nature,was a cultural heritage site.Hiroshima got then bumped up to first placebecause it had some military basesand manufacturing in it.It had not yet been bombed.Its geography was such that it wassort of like a bowl-shaped city surrounded by hills,and that meant it would kind of intensifythe effect of the weapon.So from the point of view of the United States militaryand the scientists who consulted from them,it was a perfectly good target.Nagasaki was only added to the target listafter Kyoto was taken off of itbecause they wanted a backup target.The actual target for the second bombing runwas a different city, Kokura.Kokura had a major arsenal in the center of itthat produced weapons for the Japaneseand was surrounded by workers' houses.So by their criteria, this was a great target.When they got to Kokura though,they found that it was covered by smoke or clouds or haze.It's not clear exactly what.But they could not see it to exactly target the bomb on it.So they went to the backup target,which was Nagasaki, which was nearby.matthewswaite asks, I can't helpbut think gun control debatesmirror that of nuclear weapons proliferation.Does every country having nukes make us all safer?This is a classic question.Is the world safer if there are onlya couple countries with nuclear weaponsor would it be safer if all the countrieshad nuclear weapons?If there were a lot of countries with nuclear weapons,presumably they would be very hesitantto go to war with one anotherbecause the consequences would be terrible.On the other hand, if you think that the chancesof either accidental nuclear waror people thinking nuclear war was winnable,or terrorism, if you think the chancesof those are relatively high,then more nuclear weapons in the worldis a much more dangerous worldbecause that's a world in which nuclear waris more likely to occur.It's not clear what the answer is here.Generally speaking, I'm more swayed by the argumentsthat is a little bit dangerousto have lots of countries with nuclear weapons in the world.I know that's a really hot take,but I don't trust the systemsor governments of these countries to be sort of perfectwith regard to they're not starting a nuclear war.And if you don't think that they're going to be perfect,then it becomes very dangerous over time,the more people who have nuclear weapons.Huge_Bag69 asks, Enriched uranium, what is it?What is the process of enriching?How dangerous is it on its own?So uranium is an element.You can mine it out of the ground.It's a rock.You can even get it out of sea water.It's relatively abundant.By itself, if we went out and got a rock of uranium,the uranium we would findwould have two types of uranium inside of it.One of 'em would be called uranium-238.There would be 99% of thatin any uranium we pulled out of the ground.And less than 1% of it,it's like 0.7% would be uranium-235.So these are two of the same element,but they differ in that uranium-238 has three more neutronsinside of it than uranium-235.So we call these different isotopes.Uranium-238 will not explode in a bomb.Uranium-235 will.So enrichment is when we take this uraniumand pull out the uranium-235,almost literally atom by atom.This is a very difficult process to dobecause the difference between theseis only three neutrons, which is not very much.They are chemically identical.So we have to rely on the factthat one's a little bit lighter than the other.So uranium enrichment,there's different processes for doing it.And the most famous right now is the centrifugewhere we basically are spinningaround uranium in a gaseous form,and as we spin it,the centrifugal forces will cause the lighter uraniumto move slightly and more one directionand the heavier slightly another,and we skim off the part that would have the lighter.And we have to run it through another centrifugeto skim off a little moreand then another to skim off a little more.And so we're taking advantageof little tiny statistical differencesin how heavy they are.And we do this for thousands of centrifugesand you will eventually end upwith more and more uranium-235.When we want uranium for fuel in a nuclear power plant,we tend to enrich it up to about 3% uranium-235.When we want it for a bomb,we want it to be much higher than that.The bomb dropped on Hiroshimawas about 80% uranium-235.In the United States now, the standard amount in a weapon,if we use enriched uranium, is around 93% enriched uranium.The4thResident asks, Wait, but Einsteinwas not a part of the Manhattan Project,so how or why did they get his help during it?Einstein's role in the atomic bombwas at the very beginning.He wrote a letter to President Roosevelt saying,Hey, we have learned how to split atoms.Germany might be working on this.Maybe somebody in the United States governmentshould be looking at this.And that's more or lesshis role in the whole Manhattan Project.Why didn't they use him?They actually did consider using himand they concluded two things.One, Einstein at this point is pretty old.He's not your cutting-edge scientist.The kind of science he doesis not actually that useful for making an atomic bomb.Yes, yes, =mc2 sort of explains, in a way,where the energy comes from an atomic bomb.It does not tell you how to make one.It doesn't tell you how to make a factoryand design the things and the parts.You don't need somebody like Einstein to do that.The other thing is that Einsteinwas considered politically radical.He supported really out-there ideas like civil rights.And that, at that time, meant that he was consideredto be politically questionableby some people in the US government.And so if he is the kind of person who,to be fair, might have strong ideasabout how atomic bombs ought to be usedand has a lot of fameand is the kind of person that presidents would listen to,maybe you don't want him to be in the projectif your goal is to just sort of get the thing done.CoastalBuckeye asks,Is there still a radiation field in Hiroshima or Nagasaki?Great question.Hiroshima and Nagasaki had atomic bombs dropped on themin World War II.Here's Hiroshima. This is not far from ground zero.You can see this building, the very famous Atomic Bomb Dome,ground zero is very close to that.These weapons were detonated very high above the city.If you look at pictures of these bombs,this is a mockup of the kind of bomb dropped in Hiroshima.This is one for Nagasaki.You can see they've got this equipment on them,weird little wires.These are fuses that detecthow high above the ground the bomb is,and they were set to detonate at the heightthat the scientists had calculatedwould maximize the blast effect of the weapon.You can think of the blastas going sort of as a sphere out from the explosion.And if it's really close to the ground,a lot of that is gonna be going sort of sidewaysand it's gonna be running into buildingsand they're gonna be absorbing the energyand also reducing it as a consequence.If you detonate it in the air,you're sort of going down with the blast forceand it's gonna be much wider area.So it was detonated high in the air.The consequence of that is the peopleat Hiroshima and Nagasaki,they got a blast of immediate radiation.It's like almost like a light switch turning on and off.You wouldn't be able to see it,but imagine it's just like a quick exposure,almost like X-rays or something like that.And that was very bad for the peoplewho were in the range at which that would occur.But it's a short immediate effect.It's sort of almost like a one-time exposure.The thing that makes nuclear weapons so contaminatingis the nuclear fallout.These are the split atoms from the weaponand these are in the mushroom cloud.And one interesting thingyou can actually see in some of these pictures,so this is a picture of Nagasaki's mushroom cloudtaken from someone on the one of the airplanesthat was involved in the bombing of Nagasaki.And if you look closely,you can see the cloud is actually two different parts.You have this top part, the head,and then you have this dark stem underneath it,and you can actually see that they don't connect.This is an artifact of the weapon being detonated higher up.This cloud containsthe most radioactive residues from the bomb.This is mostly created by fire and debrisand dust that is being pulled upby the negative pressure of this cloud moving upwards.And it is not that radioactive.Now, if this bomb had been detonated on the ground,these two parts would be mixed together.And if that happens,then the radioactive bits attach themselves to the dirtand then fall out of the cloud relatively quicklybecause the dirt is pretty heavy, relatively speaking.If it doesn't happen, this part stays relatively lightand it'll blow on with the windand as it blows, it'll take a whilefor it to start to fall out of the cloud.And what that gets you is two things.One, the most radioactive stuff with short half lives,they get to sort of burn out before they fall down.But this cloud, because it has time to spread,it means that it's diluting.So more area gets some radioactive bits,but they get less like per square meter, per square foot.So the amount of radiation is diffused in a waythat doesn't actually make it a contamination hazard.So the long and short of itis because they're detonated at high altitude,they did not really get a lot of nuclear fallout.Today, they are not radioactive in any significant way.If the bombs had been detonated on the ground,it would be a different story.xjsscx on Reddit asks, What actually happensto someone in an atomic bomb explosion?The first thing, if you saw a nuclear weapon go off,one, the brightness of it, it's very bright.With that brightness comes this flash of radiation.So if you are close enough to an atomic bomb,you will instantly get a lot of radioactive particles,gamma rays, beta particles, things like thisgoing through your body.For the Hiroshima bomb,the radius from the detonation pointwhere you get a fatal amount of radiationis about three quarters of a mile.If you're in that zone, you're probably deadno matter what happens next.If you're a little out of that zone,you might get some radiation.That is probably not your biggest concernfor most nuclear weapons, but it's not the best, right?The next thing that you would experience is heat.The surface of the fireball is hotter than the sun.Briefly.If you're in direct line of sight with this,it's sort of like if the sunwas suddenly a lot closer to you than it is right now.If you're really close to the fireball,you could be literally vaporized as people say.Most of the people at Hiroshima Nagasaki are not vaporizedor melted or anything, but they were severely burned.You can get really bad burns.The next effect,that fireball in that first split second of it going off,is sort of super-heating the air around it.And what's gonna happen thenis it's going to be moving outward.This is the shock wave, the blast wave.And as it goes out, it's this sort of wave of pressurethat's going to intersect with the groundand move along it and push,and the more it goes, the weaker it goes.But this is powerful enough at different distancesto do a lot of damage.So at Hiroshima,if you were about 300 meters from ground zero,that would be enough blast pressure,about 20 pounds per square inch,to destroy almost any building that is standing.Any buildings that are still remaining at Hiroshima,like the famous Atomic Bomb Dome, are gutted.Like nobody's doing well who was inside this building.They're all dead.If you go out a little further,if you were about 1.7 kilometersfrom ground zero at Hiroshima,that's the radius at which there's enoughto definitely destroy light structures.So houses, things like that.You go out further to maybe about 2.8 miles,and now the blast wave is weak enoughthat the most it's doing is sort of breaking windows.That's still not great.If you're standing at a window as this thing comes to you,it's gonna break all the glass and push it into you,and now you've been injured by a window.So depending on where you are,there's different effects that can happen.Stranfort asks on Reddit,For how long do I stay in a fallout shelterafter a nuclear war?The amount of time you need to stay in theredepends on how radioactive the fallout is.Now a lot of people think of fallout shelterslike the game or show Fallout,and they think we're gonna stay in therefor a hundred years or something like that.That is not what they're built to do.They are built to basically accommodate peopleto maybe stay in there for at most two weeks,maybe even less.You might recognize these signs.These are from the 1960s programto identify places that could be used as fallout shelters.A fallout shelter is not meantto protect you from a nuclear weapon that drops on you.What it's meant to do is be a placethat puts mass, so concrete or dirt ideally,in between you and the outside worldso that if radioactive particles fall on top of you,there is something in between you and themto cut the amount of radiation.So you can think of it when you go to the dentistand they take an X-rayand they put one of these heavy lead aprons on you.It's sort of like a building equivalent of that lead apron.Mac60five asks, How dangerous is Chernobyl Today?There are people who visit Chernobylor did before the Ukraine-Russia war.There are people who work at Chernobyl still today,and they have means of checkinghow much radiation they pick up.There are tools called dosimeters.This is one from the Cold War.It basically tracks how much radiation you get.This one works by looking through it at a lightand a little wire moves as it absorbs radiation.And the workers on these kinds of placesare making sure that the amount of radiation they pick upis within what we consider to be the safe amounts.You probably wouldn't wanna live in Chernobyl though.There are some people who have been living there,people who used to live therethat eventually went back and they've said,You know what? I just wanna live in my own home.I don't care if it's contaminated.Are they at risk?Well, a little.But if they're 70 years old and living at Chernobylincreases their cancer risk by say 5%,they're probably gonna die of something else anywaybecause it takes a long timefor those kinds of cancers to develop.If we talk about, what if 10,000 people lived thereand the cancer risk goes up by 5%,you're gonna start seeing thatas 5% more cancers in this community than you would already.austinsburner asks, How tf does radiation work?How does a place be radioactive?How does someone die from radiation poisoning?You can think of it as little particles.That's basically what the word radiation means.It means little things spitting out.And there's lots of different kinds of radiation.The kind that people are usually talking aboutis called ionizing radiation, and that means radiationof types and energies that are capableof knocking electrons off of other atoms and molecules.The problem is that if you're made out of cells,and especially if you have DNA,ionizing things, that changes their chemistry.And if you were a rock, who would care?But if you're a biological system,that means you're like shooting little bullets into cellswhich can kill them, which is fine.You have a lot of cells.Or it can, in some rare cases,change the DNA in a way that turns it into a cancerous cell.Radiation poisoning is when you get so much radiationthat the number of cells you're killingbecomes actually significant.So radioactive contamination is when a placehas radioactive stuff that is sending out the radiation.So I have a Geiger counter here.A Geiger counter is a tool for detecting radioactivity.So what it has in it is a sensor that can tellwhen a radioactive particle has gone across it.And whenever it does this,you're hearing this little click happening.Why does it click?Because we hooked it to a speakerand we wanna be able to hear it.Now I could have a radioactive substance.This is trinitite, the glass from the first nuclear test.This is something that contains trace amountsof plutonium and uraniumand long-lived fission products.And if I put the sensor over it,[Geiger counter clicks]you can hear that the clicking increases by a bit.The air right above this radioactive materialis getting about twice as much radioactivityas the normal air around here.That's not that much.If this was something actually dangerous,it would be getting a lot more, a hundred times more.But this is the sort of toolthat lets you measure when these radioactive particlesare being emitted from this radioactive substance.GlitteringWeakness88 on Reddit asks,What is the theoretical upper power limitof a nuke we can produce currently?If you wanted to,you can make essentially an unlimited power nuclear weapon.A thermonuclear weapon basically worksby having one nuclear weapon actas sort of the detonator for another nuclear weapon.And if you wanted to, you could makethat weapon be the detonator for another nuclear weapon.And that detonator for another nuclear weapon.The largest nuclear weapon ever madewas the Soviet Tsar Bomba.It was tested in 1961 as a 50-megaton-sized weapon,so 50 million tons of TNT,and that was at half its power.It was deliberately scaled back by halfto prevent contamination.By comparison, the Hiroshima bombis 15,000 tons of TNT.So this is a weapon thousands of times more powerfulthan the first atomic bombs.The United States could have done that.They actually looked into doingthat kind of thing in the Cold War and decided not to.So the largest weapon that I know ofthat was ever taken seriouslyby weapon scientists in the United Stateswas called the Sundial.It was never built.They didn't get that far in researching it.But it was a weapon that was 10,000 megatons of TNT.Why did the United States not do this?Why did even the Soviet Union not really do this?The Tsar Bomba was sort of a stuntmore than a practical weapon.The answer is, one, you don't get that much from it.Because of the way nuclear weapons work,because they're basically a sphere expanding in the air.Think of it as a balloon that you're like pumping air into.What we care about for the damageis the amount of the balloon that's gonna touch the ground.A lot of that balloon is not gonna touch the ground.And as we're putting energy into it,the part that's touching the ground,it's not increasing as a linear function.It's increasing as what's called a cubic root.The takeaway is,if we wanted to double the damage of a weapon,we typically have to increase the size of the weaponby around eight times.The real killer though is, to make them bigger,we do more or less have to linearly increase the weightand size of the weapon.So the Tsar Bomba is a powerful weapon,but it's the size of a school bus.That weapon could not fit insidethe airplane that carried itand had to sort of sit underneath it like a big egg.If you are another countryand you see a plane coming towards youwith a big egg attached to it,you're gonna really work hard to shoot that down.That is not convenient.If you're talking about weaponsthat are the size of the Sundial, 10,000 megatons,that's a weapon that's probablythe size of the space shuttle.That's not easy to use. That's not easy to deploy.That's gonna be also really expensive as an aside.Trends in nuclear weapons design didn't go in that area.What they did was they went for more compact weaponsso you can put 10 of them onto one missileand then target 10 targets with one missile.It's a weapon the size of a large trash can,but it's 30 times more explosive than Hiroshima.That's peak weapons design, not just more bang.Perfect-Football2616 on Reddit asks,Did the tactic of duck and coverprovide any protection from an actual nuclear strike?Duck and Cover was a public education programput out by the United States government,and it was particularly aimed at school children.And you'll see picturesof children hiding under their desk from this period.There was a short film createdwith a turtle cartoon mascot, Bert the Turtle,trying to talk to students about nuclear war.And, of course, a lot of it looks pretty sketchy.There are lots of people who lived through this who said,That was the moment I realizedadults did not know what they were doingif they thought this deskwas gonna protect me from an atomic bomb.They are not sayingthat if an atomic bomb lands on your school,your desk is gonna keep you safe.What they are doing with this policyis saying there's gonna be an area where the bomb goes off,where you just have no hope.I'm sorry.They don't say this in the moviebecause it's aimed at children.They don't even say this things aimed at adultsbecause the United States governmenthas a very hard time admittingthat people are gonna die in large numbersif nuclear weapons go off,even though it is self evidently true.There's also a zone much further outwhere you're far enough away that you'll say,What was that? Oh my gosh, what's going on?You are not going to be affected by the weapon, right?You're gonna learn from the news.So in between is a pretty small zonewhere you have a chance of survivingif you do the right thing.Duck and Cover is for that zone,and it's for an area where the blast pressureis going to be enoughthat it is gonna be sort of like an earthquake.They're worried about the ceiling collapsing,they're worried about windows breaking.They're worried that if you have exposed skin,you might get burned.And so the tactic is get down,cover up your most vulnerable parts,and you can increase your chance of survivala little bit that way.TheMuteNewt on Reddit, great name,How close did Nazi Germany actually getto developing an atomic weapon?Nazi Germany did not get closeto making an atomic bomb.At the end of World War II they were almost to the placethat the United States was in 1942.So they almost had a prototype nuclear reactor,not an atomic bomb.Why not? Because they weren't trying to make an atomic bomb.I know that's a hot takebecause we like to talk about the race for the atomic bomb.The Americans feared they were working on atomic bomb,but the Germans had actually decided they were gonna havea pretty small research program for nuclear reactors,maybe in the future, making atomic bombs.But they concluded in 1942that it would take a lot of workfrom a lot of their scientiststo try and make an atomic bombthat could be useful for World War II.And in 1942, they thought they were gonna win the warso they didn't think they needed an atomic bomb.They thought that making an atomic bombwould be very hard and they were correct on that.And as a result, they thought nobody elsewas gonna make one either.So this is a problem for after the war.Well, that's it. That's all the questions.I hope you learned something.I hope you don't make an atomic bomb.Until next time.
