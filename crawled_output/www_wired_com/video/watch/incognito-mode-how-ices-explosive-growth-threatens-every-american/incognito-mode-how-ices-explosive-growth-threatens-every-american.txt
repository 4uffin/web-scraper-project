aggressive tacticsin videos online.While many people find these videos really disturbing,others question why this matters to them at all.If they're not here in the US illegally,do they really have to care?Isn't this just law enforcement in action?Today we're gonna be breaking down how ICE's expansionof power will impact everybody in the US.This is Incognito Mode.[tense music]Social media monitoring is one of the big waysthat the US government surveils a lot of people.In fact, if you're posting online,they're probably surveilling you right now.The State Department has expanded its useof social media surveillance to monitor anybodywho wants to enter the US.But even if you're not a traveler here,you're probably being surveilled.The independent reports that ICE is expanding its useof social media surveillanceto search for anti-ICE sentiment.So if you're going to a protestor posting about ICE online in waysthat they might not like, you're probably getting scooped upinto a surveillance machine you might not even know exists.It's been reported that one social media surveillance toolused by government agencies including ICE is Social Net,which can reportedly monitor up to 200 websites,social media platforms, another online spaces.Some of these platforms include Facebook, Instagram, X,Blue Sky, TikTok, Reddit, PayPal, OnlyFans, Cash App,WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, chess.com for some reason.Pretty much anywhere you are online,SocialNet is probably watching.It's been reported that ICE's Homeland SecurityInvestigations Division has directly contractedwith Shadow Dragon, which makes SocialNet.The problem with social media surveillanceis that by its very nature,it's a massive dragnet operation.They're collecting data on basically everyone,especially anyone who's posting online all the time.This massive amount of datathat's being collected doesn't just go away.All this data is likely being storedand can potentially be used at any point in the futureto target you for anything.So right now, these tools are being usedto target one kind of speech,but in the future, an administration could chooseto use it to target something entirely different.A big problem with social media surveillanceis that can chill speech.You might not post about things online if you knowthat ICE agents or other law enforcementare flagging your speechjust because you set a certain keywordor expressed a certain sentiment,that's gonna dissuade people from exercisingtheir First Amendment rights, going to protestsor speaking out against things they disagree with.[tense music]One of the first ways you might thinkof ICE impacting you is surveillance.Facial recognition is one of the ways we knowthat ICE is targeting pretty much anybodythey come across who they find suspicious.Immigration officials have long used facial recognitionat the border, but now agentscan use it right on their phones.Using an app called Mobile Fortify,they can just point their camera at youand run your face through a bunch of different databasesthat does identity verification on the fly.So why is this a problem?Well, first of all, Mobile Fortify,like other facial recognition systems,has a margin of error.That means it can bring up false positives,so the app might identify you as being somebodywho you're not, and maybe that personis a hardened criminal who's in the US illegallyand you might get detained.The other issue is what we call surveillance creep.This means that powerful surveillance toolsare being used in more and more waysand is becoming normalized.It might be ICE agents using it today,but you can imagine the situationwhere a police officer is standing on a cornerand just pointing his phone at everybodytrying to catch a criminal.Now, you might think this kind of surveillanceisn't a big deal, and you might think, hey,if cops are catching more criminals, that's great.The problem is that once a surveillance power is introduced,it's very rare that it gets taken away.While you might agree with the law enforcement actionsof one administration, another administrationmight have totally different prioritiesand totally different targets.As we see in all types of situations,technology moves faster than laws.As of now, there's no federal lawregulating the use of facial recognition by ICEor any other law enforcement agency.[gentle music]ICE's use of data brokers is another formof digital surveillance.ICE isn't just buying data one-off.They also have contracts with data brokers like LexisNexis,which gives thousands of agents accessto all types of data about anyone they're targeting.This means they know who you are, who you know,who your family members are, what your criminal history is,whether you own a boat or a car.All this information is readily available to ICEfor anyone who they wanna target.ICE is making useof something called the data Broker loophole,which allows the agency to just buy datathat they might otherwise have to obtainthrough a subpoena or a warrant.ICE has reportedly used the data broker loopholeto get around Colorado's Sanctuary Cities laws,which prevent local policefrom sharing information with the agency.ICE was able to just buy data on targetsrather than getting it through a processthat involves judicial review.[gentle music]ICE has a program known as 287G,which allows it to deputizelocal and state police to help in deportation actions.Under 287G, ICE has agreementswith some 800 departments across 40 states,with dozens more pending.This is all part of the agency's effortsto rapidly increase enforcement actions.We're not asking them to be immigration officers.We're asking them to help us,cops working with the cops to keep New York safe.Named Operation Tidal Wave,ICE's, expansion of 287G means a massive amountof resources across the country are being devotedjust towards the issues of immigration and deportation.Even if you think immigration is the most pressing issue,getting local law enforcement involvedcan have consequences beyond what you might expect.First of all, local police need to have a relationshipwith their community so that peoplecan trust them when they call to report a crime.If your family has mixed immigration statusor even if you just look a certain way,you may be more unlikely to call the policeand report a crime, and that makes everybody less safe.Another issue is that local police have limited budgets.This inevitably means that resourcesare gonna be diverted from other thingslike investigating thefts or murdersor child abductions.With resources from the federal governmentto your local police being divertedtowards immigration issues,all types of other thingsare going to go ignored or underfunded.[upbeat music]As ICE's power is expanding,it's sweeping up even more peopleinto its crosshairs, not just immigrants.For example, in July, 2025,Wired reported on a bulletinfrom the Department of Homeland Security,which oversees ICE.The memo characterized regular activitieslike riding a skateboard or a bicycleas running reconnaissancefor protestors and indicative of potential violence.We've also seen ICE agents arrest US citizenswho were nearbywhile they were conducting raids and arrests.According to Wired reporting, protestors are subjectto all types of social media surveillancewith law enforcement building dossiers on themthat can include their names, their affiliationsand the things they say online.This is a perfect exampleof how these tools can be turned against anyonean administration deems problematic.[upbeat music]Founded in 2003, in the wake of 9/11, under the taskof increasing national security, ICE has since becomeone of the most dominant law enforcement agenciesin the United States and has poisedto reach its apex under the second Trump administration,which has promised mass deportations on a historic scale.We're gonna have to have a deportation levelthat we haven't seen in this countryfor a long time since Dwight Eisenhower actually.Even though news of ICE arrestsand detentions are happening all the time,it's about to get even bigger.Congress recently allocated some $170 billiontowards immigration enforcement,making it more heavily fundedthan any other law enforcement agencyin the United States, including the FBI and the DEA.While the Trump administration has framed ICE's actionsas removing criminals from our communities,65% of people targeted by ICE have no criminal convictionsand 93% have no violent convictions.What this looks like on the groundis masked unidentified ICE agentsstorming into restaurants and other businessesand snatching people off the street,even if they've never been involved in any crime at all.Agents are even arresting people at courthouseswhen they show up for their immigration court appointments.Even green card holders have been targeted,so it's not just undocumented criminal immigrantswho are being targeted, it's pretty much anybodywho has a vulnerable immigration status.On paper, ICE's detention rate has soared to 140%of the capacity of detention centers.This has led to massive overcrowding,unsanitary conditions, lack of medical careand other issues within detention centers,and it's only poised to get worse.We are looking to set a goal of a minimumof 3000 arrests for ICE every day,and President Trump is gonna keep pushingto get that number up higher.In June, ICE agents arrested an averageof 1200 people a day.That's nearly twice as manyas during the first 100days of the second Trump administration.[upbeat music]There's very little anyone can doto push back against ICE's enforcement actions,but some people are trying.Apps like ICE Block allow people to identify ICE agents,where they are, what they look likeand even what their vehicles are,but even that can come with consequences.The Trump administration has threatened the developerof ICE Block with prosecution,and people have criticized the appfor endangering ICE agents.The Trump administration has also equatedrevealing ICE agents identities as illegal doxing.We should just note that making an app like ICE Blockor publishing an ICE Agent's personal informationis according to legal expertsprotected by the First Amendment.[person shouting]The disappearance of hundreds of thousandsor even millions of people is going to change American life,regardless of your views on immigration.This can happen in small ways from people you knowsuddenly vanishing and big waysto having fewer people in the American economyand thus making it shrink.No matter who you are, and no matter what you thinkabout immigration or ICE's tacticsor the second Trump administration,mass deportations are going to have an impact on your life.This has been Incognito
