Fry,pizza delivery boyand Professor Hubert Farnsworth, 147-year-old [groaning]and the voice of Zapp Brannigan.Now everybody go take a napand improve the quality of life around here, won't you, eh?And we're gonna try and answer the most Googled questionsabout our show Futurama.I hope there's something to eat in this box.[all laughing][upbeat music]Are Futurama and the Simpsons made by the same people?Yes. Yes, Matt Groeningand a bunch of Harvard alumni.Exactly, I don't know why the geniusesare always kind of shy and sweet,but that's what it seems like anyway.Well, I wish people this smart made more movies.Exactly. I wish all of societywas like that.How about that?Here's one.Are Fry and Leela married.I think they did get married, yes?Absolutely they did.Finally, yes, after going through so much romanceand so many ups and downs,and you don't need two eyes just to be married.Right, how is Fry related to the Professor?Well, he's the great, great, great, great, great, great,[Phil] great, forever great. Uncle.Nephew, great nephew.Fry is older than the professor though.Which year is Futurama currently in?Isn't it a thousand years from this year?Yes, which is.Oh, is that right? So it would be 3000.3025?Well, we started. Oh, that's right.The show in 1999,And the first episode was in 3099.Wait, '99, but I got married in 97.No, I'm sorry, it was 2999.Okay. Right before,and new year was 3000.Okay. We're not math majors.Something like that.We didn't go to Harvard.No. [Phil laughing]Okay.Why don't you read it?What's Amy Wong's Home Planet?Oh, thank God I know one.Mars, we own half of it.Her family owns half of Mars.They own a herd of buggalo.It must be nice. Yeah, and it's,and it's interesting in Futurama,Mars is where people with good money live,not just green people.[Lauren laughing]Yes, and there's also, it's the home of Mars University.Yes, the best schoolthat's like the Harvard of the universe, right?[Phil laughing]How did Hermes lose his body?Doing limbo under swords.Is that right? Mm hmm.Oh, my God, I blocked that out.Yeah. Wow.He got, cut him, and then got his head cut off.Seriously? Oh my God.But he got it back though, right?Yeah.Okay. In the next episodeor at the end of that episode?In the end of that episode. Okay, good.Yeah, we can't let anything happen to him.No. What instrumentdoes Fry try to learn?I think, well it was an instrument,a really cool looking instrument called the Holophonor,and what it does is it plays notes that become visuals.Oh, I love that. It's very beautiful,very psychedelic, and he wants to demonstrate his lovethrough music and notes and visuals for Leelawho missed the whole thing.And yes, it was all for nothing.Like most love I've ever known.No, come on now. [Phil laughing]What's the title of the first episode?Uh oh, I need help.Ah, the title of the first episode was Space Pilot 3000.Is that right?Okay, very good, Phil.The series has landed.And it's probably more about Frywanting to be a pilot in spaceas opposed to just referring to the first episode of a show.Right, right.And that was a long time ago.And we watched that pilot at the Observatory.That's right, it was so beautiful.They screened it on the ceiling,and we all just like laid back and watched.It was just, it was such a magical night.Ah, that's for you Phil.This question was, does Hermes eatmore than just Manwiches?Yeah. Be careful.Of course. Like what?He eats lots of other things.I mean, 'cause his wife cooks well.That's right.Does he eat. La Barbara?Yeah. Does he eat jerk chicken?Yeah.How about jerk pork? Yeah.Do you like that in real life?Yeah. Well, I don't havehis hair or his stuff. [Lauren laughing]I don't, I don't eat like my cartoon character.No?Where is Fry from?Well, he appears to be from New York City.Right.At least that's where he livedwhen he was delivering pizzas,but I think his family might be from.That's even where he went to school in eight.Yeah. His personalityseems more like Midwest to me. Old New York.Like down to earth, you know, just so down to earth.He's all over the place, and he's kind of needy,but his heart's in the right place.How old is Leela?Never tell a thing like that.I don't know, she looked like, when he first met her,she looked like she was about 30 maybe.Yeah. Yeah.Still a baby.How old is the Professor? Ah that one,we might actually know.Now we talked about this.He's 147, but he's older nowbecause that's how old he was when we started.Right, right, he was 147 in 2999.Okay, how did Futurama start?It started in the mind of Matt Groening.Yeah.I remember in 1964 or five,I went to the New York World's Fair,and I rode on a ride called the Futurama.Oh really? And that's where the nameof the show came from.Oh. Really?Oh wow. Yeah, it wasGeneral Motors had a ride called Futurama.Did you talk to Matt about that?Oh sure. Oh!Wow. And I rememberriding on it when I was about 11,and it showed you what the future was gonna look like.Boy, did they lie?Boy, were they wrong.Damn, I wish I'd Googled that.How rich is Fry?Well, he's been super rich.He was, when? Because he hadsome sardines or anchovies rather.Oh. That were worthtons of money in the future.I forgot that. Right.Who ordered the pizza?Ah, I know.Who?You mean at the place where he got frozen?Where, yeah, in the cryogenics lab.Oh.Pizza delivery for Icy Wiener.Oh yeah! Oh my gosh, I can't.Icy Wiener.It was a prank.Ladies and gentlemen, here's the first personto memorize his cartoon script.[Lauren laughing]Who is Agnew?Well, if anybody knows their history,he was Nixon's vice president.Oh. But he's the headless bodyof Agnew in the show.So I don't know how he growls.He growls like Frankenstein. [Billy growling][Phil laughing]I do Richard Nixon in the show,and I don't sound anything like him.I'm like, [Billy growling]but I saw the debate between Nixon and Kennedy in 1962.And Kennedy looked like a game show host.And Nixon looked like a sweat hog.He was sweating and his hair was matted,and they did extreme closeups.And you could see the hair growing out of his pores.He was like, I wanna be President of the United Statesbecause, [Billy growling]and I said to my mom,mom, he looks like he's gonna turn into a werewolf.[Phil laughing]And so that's why I howl like a werewolf doing Nixon.[Billy growling]I am Richard M. Nixon, President of Earth.And [Billy growling and howling]That bastard drafted me in 1980 by the way, in 1980, 1970.And to this very day in the Nixon Libraryruns a continuous loop of all the Nixon stuffI did on Futurama, in his library.So I won. Ah!What Olympic sport did Hermes compete in?He did the Olympics, he did limbo.Of course he did.How did he do?Hmm, he did really good. Yeah?Well, he was almost there up against the bigger guy.But hopefully in the futurethat will be added to the Olympics.Chuck that for us.Chuck it. Yay!Oh hey.Oh shoot, I'm gonna need help.What is Amy's obscene tattoo?Do you guys know?I only have one?I didn't know she had a tattoo.What is it?Do I have two?Gimme a hint.Slippery when wet. No.No.[Interviewer] Part of the running gagis that we never actually see what it is.Oh!So that's just for me to know and you to find out.And she knows more about the show than we do.How do you feel now?Ah, good.So I don't have to answer that, do I?How long can humans live?Well-- In Futurama?I mean. A long time.Long time. On Mars?Well, how old is the Professorwhen Fry gets to the future? 147 years old.So in a thousand years, we'll all live hundreds of years.As long as you eat dog food.[all laughing]Turns out dog food is a health food in the future.No, not, I don't know.I'm just making stuff up.Is Leela an alien or a mutant?She's a mutant. Right, she calls herselfan alien, but she's actually a mutant.Yes, and. Which is whyher family lives underground.And that's why she's a cyclops.Her family is, they're the nicest people.They just look really weird.But, you know, who's to judge?I already, I already told you why Nixon howls.Why does Nixon howl? I howlbecause I have big jowls. [Billy growling]Why is he called Bender?Because he bends things.Well, because he was programmedto bend things. Bend, yeah.Constructively.He's Mexican actually, he was made in Mexico.Right. HO in Mexico.He, um. Yes, with the helpof inspector number five.Right, you have to know the show.It runs all the time.You can sleep to it.Or perhaps he's called Bender.'cause in Matt Groening's other show,there was a character named Homer.So there's gotta be a characterthat people are gonna love whose name ends with er.How many kids does Bender have?Who the hell knows?I don't know.None, right?[buzzer rings]Does he have any?He doesn't breed.This is for you, lovely.Oh, this question is, how did Hermes get his groove back?Well, 'cause he was facing problemswith the bureaucracy organization.He tried to straighten them outand taught them that when push comes to shove,you gotta do what you love,even if it's not a good idea.You requisitioned your groove back.Right. That's right.That's right. What does theJ stand for in Fry's name?John? I don't knowif it was ever addressed.I do know that it's a longstanding cartoon traditionto give a character the initial J.Really? Yeah,like Rocket J. Squirrel.Oh. Homer J. Simpson.Bullwinkle J. Moose.Philip J. Fry.It's a, you know, a cartoon thing.You wouldn't understand. [Phil and Lauren laughing]What ancient civilization did Bender become Pharaoh of?Yipes, yipes, yipes.I feel like I have to go download that episodeto answer that question.Amazonia?I feel embarrassed because I don't remember.I don't remember.

And an alienand working on bodies differently than his planet.Yes, that's hellaciously funny to me,that he's a doctor and he's poor.I never met a poor doctor in my life.It's probably cause he gets paid in food, not money.What role does Kif play in Zapp's missions?Well, Kif is sort of a.Second in command, right?.A second in command, under officer,an errand boy, you know, just.My Kiffy.Yeah, he gets demeaned by Zapp Brannigan,who is lout, deliciously stupid.He's very much fun to play because he's that way.Who killed Agnew?Nah, I don't know.[buzzer dings]I don't remember.Oh, you can, you can, this is a big reveal.You tell us what this.Oh, this question.
