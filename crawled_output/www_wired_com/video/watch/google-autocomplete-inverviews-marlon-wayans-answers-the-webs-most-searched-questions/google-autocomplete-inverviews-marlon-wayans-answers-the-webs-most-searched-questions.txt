Sure.For how long?Not long.Can I go through my legs?Maybe once out of 10 tries.Can I go behind my back?Basically how much are you paying Marlon Wayans?If you pay me enough, I could play.And if not, there's some stunt doubles out therethat look just like me that are damn good in basketball.Can Marlon Wayans sing?I wouldn't say I could sing.I could say I could hold a note,but I'm a desperate performer so I love karaoke.So that's my thing, karaoke.And I like to karaoke deep voice.You give me somebody with a deep voicelike Teddy Pendergrass.♪ Turn out the lights and light a candle ♪See what I'm saying?♪ I just wanna growl to you ♪♪ Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm ♪Rick James.♪ Turned on my fire, baby ♪♪ And you show me what love can do ♪♪ Fire and desire, baby ♪♪ Feel it coming through ♪♪ And I thank you, baby ♪That's a song that made Axl's mother fall in love with me.And actually that's the songthat she got herself impregnated by me too.So how to make a bastard.Rick James, whiskey, Fire and Desire equals Axl.What was Marlon Mayans' first movie?My first real movie was playing the roleof Seymour in Mo Money.And yes, that was my brother Damon's movie,but he didn't give it to me.I actually went out and auditionedagainst everybody to go get that movieand I got it and my black ass left college to go do itbecause that was to me the perfectstarting vehicle for me at 19.What is Marlon Wayans' best movie?My best movie would probably have to be, I'm gonna say two.My best movie would probably be, actually three.I did too many movies, you asking me to choose.All right, my best movie is definitely Him.White Chicks I thought was really greatand that was just a really fun experience.Requiem for a Dream, great dramatic performancesand a wonderful movie to be a part of.But Him is actually the complete,crazy, untethered, off-the-chain Marlon Wayansat his best in a wonderful moviethat's really high octane energyand you've never seen nothing like it.What is Marlon Wayans up to?Well, right now, jackass, I'm doing interviewsand you asking me questions.So that's what I'm up to.What is Marlon Wayans' next move?If you're talking about like a break dance move,I don't know.I'm past the pop lock years.If you're thinking movie, my next movie will beScary Movie 6 out in theaters June 12th, 2026.Who.Who was Marlon Wayans in White Chicks?Believe it or not, I was the cute white chick.Sean looked, who's a more handsome black man,was not a good looking white chick.He was like Shannon Sharpe's taste in White Chick.He's like, I think that, I like that thick one.I like the thick one right there.That one with that little mutt there.Who does Marlon Wayans play in Sextuplets?Interesting question.Every goddamn body.It's called Sextuplets and I was all six of the sextupletsand then I played the mama too.I was about to play extras,but my producing partner, Rick Alvarez, stopped me.Who is Marlon Wayans' best friend?One is my best friend Omar Eppswho I've known since high school.We dreamt about being famous togetherand we made our realities come trueand I think our best years' ahead of us.So Omar Epps, he was in the movie Juiceand I was in Mo Money and he became famous before me.And then I got famous like a year after.And then we was like chocolateand light chocolate and milk chocolate.And the girls used to go crazy for us in the '90s.So that's my boy.But then I had this beautiful littletwo and a half year old daughter now named Axl.And Axl, you are always daddy's best friend.[lips smack]So fuck Omar.Who is Marlon Wayans' family?A lot of Negroes.My family is a lot of Negroes, pick a Negro.Sean, Keenan, Damon, Kim, Tito,Jackie, Jermaine, El, Bunny.All the black families just start blending together.So pick one, they all family.Marlon Wayans.Marlon Wayans as George Raveling.George Raveling, rest in peace.I was lucky enough to meet this legendary man.We had produced a documentary called Unraveling George.It's a wonderful documentary about a wonderful man.And I played him in the movie Air and I only had one sceneand he told me I did a great job playing him.So kudos even though he died.But he told me that before he died.He said, My last words,you did a great job playing me in 'Air.'Marlon Wayans latest movie.My latest movie is Him.If you don't know about it,obviously you haven't driven by Sunset.If you don't know about it,then you haven't been to Times Square either.If you don't know about it,then you've been underneath a damn rock.It's everywhere.I'm tired of seeing me.I think my role in Him as Isaiah White,I don't think it pushed mein ways I hadn't been pushed before.I think what it allowed me to dowas unstrap from every character I ever was beforeto become something that was bigger than the role.I had to just be untetheredand allowing me the freedom to bring all this crazyand all the humor, all the darkness to this characterI think makes it a special performanceand a very special movie.Marlon Wayans Jordan Peele.What a combination.That's like peanut butter and chocolate,and it's like, damn, they made Reese's,and it's a great combination.What's crazy is we have a lot of similarities.Jordan and I are coming from sketch.And when you come from sketch,you know that you just see the world in a very twisted way.We're both twisted people who have a crazy diverse skillset.And I think him and the director Justin Tippingsaw that special thing in me,that crazy, that little bit of crazy that I could addto Isaiah White that no other actor could applyand they chose me.Weird take but good choice, fellas.I think it worked out.Marlon Wayans Loc Dog.Y'all like, who is Loc Dog?Well if you don't know who Loc Dog is, homie,you don't know nothing about no hood movies.So go watch Don't Be a Menace to South CentralWhile Drinking Your Juice in the Hood, cuz.And what you say about my mama?Marlon Wayans Little Man smile.When was Marlon Wayans on In Living Color?Probably before your dumb ass was born.I think it was '92.I had just did Mo Money.Mo Money came out in '92.After Mo Money, I did Above the Rim.Before Above the Rim, I did In Living Color.And then we left In Living Colorand I did Above the Rim.And then I got Batman, which was a tease.And then I didn't get Batman 'cause they wrote me out.And then depression.When Marlon Wayans.Is Marlon Wayans making a new Scary Movie?You're damn right, and it's going to be a riot.Y'all ain't laughing 25 years, about time.Get out your feelings, y'all get off social media.Stop being a bunch of bitch-ass niggasand get ready to laugh.How was Marlon Wayans cast in Requiem for a Dream?It was unlike Him where they actuallychose me for the role.No.That bushy ass Darren Aronofsky made me audition five times.And he was like, I don't want somebodyon the WB Network in my gritty drama 'Requiem for a Dream.'But I kept coming back like a roachand I was just so committedand I just kept showing him different moves to the basket.Everything he tried to, you know,he wanted somebody else for the role.I think he want that little short black dude Seanfrom Save the Last Dance.And I'm so glad he picked me for Requiem for a Dream.Mm.You give Darren a budgetand he love to make a bad movie with a big budget.Give him $1.50, you will get classics.Darren, I always said you don't like money,but when you don't have money, yo,you really make some great movies.My point is, I won the role as Tyrone C. Lovein Requiem for a Dream and Darren and I made history.Hey, that's all the board.Thanks for having me.I'm out.Up NextMelissa McCarthy & Kristen Bell Answer The Web’s Most Searched QuestionsNASA Astronauts Answer The Web’s Most Searched QuestionsCommon Answers The Web’s Most Searched QuestionsIce Cube Answers The Web’s Most Searched QuestionsEve Answers The Web’s Most Searched QuestionsSeth Rogen & Rose Byrne Answer The Web’s Most Searched QuestionsThe Cast of Warcraft Answer The Web's Most Searched QuestionsSlow Mo Guys, MatPat, AsapSCIENCE, and Burnie Burns Answer the Web's Most Searched Questions
