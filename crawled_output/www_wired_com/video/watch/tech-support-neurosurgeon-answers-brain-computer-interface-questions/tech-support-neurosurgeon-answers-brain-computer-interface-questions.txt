Brain-Computer Interface Support.[upbeat music]WinnieCherian asks,How does brain-computer interface technology work?Brain-computer interface technology uses the factthat the brain communicates with itselfand with the outside world using electrical signals.And so brain-computer interfaces are implantsthat use tiny little electrodes that touch the brainand transform the electrical signals from the braininto ways of interacting with computersand external devices.That translation of electrical signalsinto useful means of communication with the outside worldtakes place using machine learning algorithmsthat transform the digitized bitstreamsfrom brain electrical datainto means of communication with computers, smart devices,and in some cases, robotics.Inskigator asks, Could somebody, anybody,explain to me why a human being would even wanta brain-computer interface implanted in him/her?I only ask 'cause it's happened.Well, I think it's important to understandthat one of the early usesof brain-computer interface technologyis especially for people with disorders of the brainand nervous system,and I'm talking about peoplewith spinal cord injury, stroke,and some forms of neurodegenerative disease such as ALS,conditions that paralyze peopleand leave people with totally functioning mind,unable to interact with the worldin the ways that many of us take for granted.The first generation of brain-computer interface technologyis really geared towards enabling peoplewith those kinds of conditionsto interact with other people, with the outside world,return to work and have a sense of dignity, independencethat many of us take for granted.Guavault asks, Can you move a cursor in your mindor draw using a cursor?That's how BCIs for blind people work right now.Everything needs to be drawn, AKA sequential,instead of all at once.Let me try to unpack this question.How do you move a cursor with your mind?Or how do people with brain-computer interfaceslearn to move a cursor using their mind?For each person who's had this experience,it's a little bit different.At the beginning, we usually provide an instruction,think about moving a joystickor think about moving your handor think about moving your arm.At first it's very laboriousand eventually the brain just connects to the cursor.Like you learn to use a tool, a pencil, a baseball bat,or riding a bicycle,so that the brain-computer interfaceis a tool like any other.And we're still really learning what that experience is likeand how the brain accomplishes it.But that is the subjective experiencethat people who've used this technology explain,that it sort of clicks at some pointand it starts to feel like magic.You know, when we interact with the real world,we don't realize it, but there's actually a delaybetween what our brain thinks and tells the body to doand when the body does it.I.n a brain-computer interfacewhere the interaction takes placedirectly between the brain and electrode,we can bring that latency down to individual milliseconds.That's why people feel like the experienceis almost like the interface is predicting their thought.There's another question that's packed in here.Can brain-computer interfacesmanifest a fully formed thought?That gets to the questionof how we subjectively feel like we're thinking.Very often we imagine something or we have a feelingor a picture or a concept in our brains,and we don't right now have a way of expressingthat fully formed thoughtother than through drawing a pictureor speaking in paragraph form.But we do have this subjective sensethat thoughts exist in a fully formed way.And there's this question that I think Guavault is asking,which is, will brain-computer interfaces allow usto transmit thoughts in that fully formed way?I have a feeling that the technology will allow usto travel in that directionprobably even faster than we can imagine,even if we can't say exactly how right now.Pesh909x asks, Will BCIs ever be ableto record our dreams and psychedelic trips to video?And the answer is yes.Brain-computer interfaces alreadycan see activity in the visual cortex,which is the part of the brainthat processes visual information.And there has been some work showing that actuallysome of that information can be decodedto recreate the visual scene.There is some evidence that that kind of visual replayhappens during our dreams,and so it may be possible in the futurejust as some of these studies have begun to showthat brain-computer interfaces can record, replay,process the information that occursduring imagined visual activity and dreams.Stephen_Roto asks, The first human patientwith a brain-computer implantused the technology to successfully play Mario Kart?If that isn't the definition of a '90s kid,I don't know what is.It is true that the first Neuralink patientused his implant to play Mario Kartand seems to have had a great time doing it.That wasn't the first human patientwith a brain-computer implant,but he did use it to play Mario Kart.And I think that points to the factthat people are gonna use brain-computer interfacesto do all the sorts of things that we take for grantedand know and love can be done in the digital world.Fashion Savage asks, Will BCI lead to security issuesof hacking or reprogramming people's brains?This is a really important question.It's one that many people have asked,which is, given the sensitivity of neural information,will BCI technology lead to issues involving hackingor compromising the security of people's private thoughts?Certainly in the first generationof brain-computer interfaces,we're really interactingwith the parts of the conscious brainthat move the body and move the hands, move the arms,move the face and the muscles that control speech.And these are not really areas of the brainthat we consider private thought activity,and furthermore, patients, when you ask them,would you be concerned about a privacy issue,in this context, many of the peoplewho stand to benefit from this technologywould trade a little bit of privacyfor the ability to interact smoothly with the outside world,but that doesn't minimize the possibilityof real security and privacy issueswhen neural data is being transmitted wirelesslyoutside of the body.So we and others involved in the industryhave taken real care to try to encryptand secure any neural data streams that leave the body.RealEditor6 asks, I was wonderingif ever a human brain merged with an LLMvia a brain-computer interface,what would the AI experience?What would that person experience?Is anyone connected already?The answer is a qualified yesbecause people with brain-computer interfacesnow certainly have the abilityusing the same means that we doof textually querying an LLM.And so that interaction is definitely happening.I haven't asked the AI what the AI's experience is,but certainly we can do that.I look forward to that question.What would that person experienceI think is actually very similarin the current form of the technologyto what you and I experience when we query the AI.Those interactions right now are textual in nature.The AI's output is not fed backdirectly into the user's brain just yet.So the BCI users have an experiencethat's similar to what every other user of an LLM has.But I get the question is asking towards a future statein which there's a more symbiotic meldbetween artificial intelligence and humansthrough brain-computer interfaces.And I think this is the direction of travel,and it's hard to predict exactly what it's gonna look like.James Rosen-Birch asks,What part of the brain is the BCI interfacing with?Many brain-computer interfaces to datespend a lot of time in and around the motor cortex,which is this area of the brain.This is the hand motor area, this is the leg motor area,this is the face motor area involved in speech.Those motor areas are really importantfor current-generation brain-computer interfacesbecause they perform the computations in the brainthat allow us to interact with the world physically.When we think about things like typing or moving our handsor walking or speaking,those are the parts of the brainthat serve those functions most directly.But there certainly are future directionsof brain-computer interface technology.We can think about connecting toand interfacing with other areas of the brainand other areas of the nervous system,so areas that control sensation, decision-making, memory,even parts of the brain stem and spinal cordthat are involved in other types of neurological disease.Our friends at g.tec medical engineering,How many electrodes are neededto run the brain-computer interface?The answer to that is in the hundreds or thousands,and that just gets us off the ground.I think it's hard to saywhat the upper limit is to functionality.So many of us are familiar in the world of communicationthat basically the higher the speed of your connection,the more sophisticated the applications you can run,or in the world of images,the more pixels or megapixels you have in your display,the higher fidelity the graphics you can render.And the same is true in brain-computer interfaces.The more detailed and the higher resolutionthe picture of brain activity you can generate,the more smooth and sophisticatedthe real-time interaction you can have with the brain.Right now we're seeing that brain-computer interfaceswith around a thousand electrodes get us off the groundto incredibly high levels of functionalitythat include things like controlling a cursor,performing the sorts of tasks that we take for grantedin everyday interactions with computers,but we can see a path towards many thousands of electrodesand even orders of magnitude higherin which smooth, intuitive connections between the brainand the outside world will be even higher performance.Ok-Hunter-8210 asks,Considering recent developmentsin brain-computer interfaces,I'd love to hear from experts or enthusiastsabout potential applicationsin assisting individuals with severe paralysis or ALS.Have we made sufficient stridestoward leveraging BCI technologyfor rehabilitation purposes?Yes.Severe paralysis and ALS are really the first conditionsthat have received a tremendous amount of attentionfor brain-computer interface technology.There's quite a few examples of patients in clinical studieswho have had tremendous benefit from their implantsquite apart from being part of the clinical studies,and it's exactly these individualswith severe paralysis from spinal cord injury,certain forms of stroke and ALSwill be among the first to benefit from the technology.A Reddit user in the singularity thread asks,Is there a concrete pathwayto non-invasive BCI technology?Mostly no in the way that we think of,but also yes to the implied question of,is there a use for non-invasive neural interfaces?So when I think about brain-computer interfaces,I think about systems that are being usedto drive real-time interactionsbetween the brain and the outside world.And that kind of high-bandwidth,sophisticated, smooth, high-speed interactionsbetween the brain and the outside worldthat really happen at the speed of thought,that requires implanted technology.There's no way that we know of around the needto actually be touching the brain in some wayto get that kind of high-bandwidth, high-speed interaction.Non-invasive techniques and technologieshave captured scientists' and neuroscientists' imaginationfor a long time,and there definitely is a use for non-invasive technologies.They can detect brain state,they can manipulate brain state,and they can be used to treat certain forms of disease,but not to manipulate at high fidelityand high resolution in real time.@HowardG69263 asks,Brain-computer interfaces sound cool,but kind of scary too.Like, what if it malfunctions or something?So many important technologieshave these sorts of questions attached to them,whether it's cars or airplanesor gene sequencing or artificial intelligence.There's always this question of,it's magical when it works welland what if it doesn't work well or what if it malfunctions?It is important,as in the development of all kinds of technology,to have ways of fixing things when they go wrong.You know, Murphy's law is real.Anything that can go wrong will happen in some way,and so we need to try to anticipate failure modesand plan for how to fix them.We've developed electrodes that interact with the brainin a way that doesn't damage the brain,and so these electrodes can be moved, removed, replaced,and upgraded as necessary in the future,and other components of the systemcan be modularly changed out over time.For example, the battery or the wirelessor certain forms of tunneled connectorsthat are implanted under the skin.So understanding the way things obsolesce or changeor may need to be switched out in the future is importantto ensuring that we can safely repair a deviceand plan for all eventualities.QueenGwenevere asks,Imagine what happens when an implant becomes obsolete,is no longer supported,and becomes increasingly vulnerable to hackingthe longer it remains installed,and you can't uninstall it without surgery.Like, imagine if you had the equivalentof Flash implanted in your brain.This is actually a really deep question,and it gets to the notion that all technologies have a cycleand you wanna be able to plan for upgradesand plan against obsolescence.At Precision, one of the waysthat we've thought about this question of obsolescenceand the potential need for replacementis to develop an electrotechnologythat's based on thin films.This is the Precision electrode array.If I turn it on its side in this way,you can see it's incredibly thin.This film coats the brain's surface with electrodesrather than penetrating the brain.The idea is that those electrodescould be removed or upgraded over timeand that other components of the implantalso can be removed or swapped out.This notion that somethingcan't be uninstalled without surgery is an important notion,but I would also just point out that surgery itselfis not necessarily such a huge barrier.Actually, almost everyone over the courseof their life in the United States will have a surgery,if not more than one surgery.So really it's a question of making surethat it can be done in a safe mannerrather than the concept of a surgery itself.Dckill97 asks, Why can brain-computer interface technologyonly read from the brain and not write to it?The short answer is that brain-computer interface technologycan both read from and write to the brain.Reading really meansrecording neural activity and decoding it,recording the electoral signalsthat the brain uses to communicateand transforming those into command and control signalsand ways of interaction with digital technology, computers,and the outside world.So that's really a translation problem.The other side of the coinis what people sometimes call writing into the brain,and that really means stimulating the brain in some way.In the contextof current-generation brain-computer interfaces,that stimulation takes placeusing electrical pulses, electrical stimulation.Those kinds of stimulation have been usedto restore a sense of sensation, touch, vision,and also to stimulate the brain in other ways.Most of current generationbrain-computer interface technologyreally is focused on the read and decode side of things.Reading and writing or recording and stimulatingare actually quite different problems.You can't just sort of reverse the decoding into an encoderthat writes information into the brain.It's not that simple.The field of genomics is one good example of thisin which the early 2000s saw an explosionin our ability to recordor read and decode the human genome,and it wasn't until years later really using almosta completely different form of technology,things like CRISPR for gene editing,that allowed gene modificationin a scalable and programmatic way.Ulteriorkid324 asks,How do you get a brain chip into the brain?Is the surgery long?The surgery is a relatively short surgery.General anesthesia will not always be required.It involves making a small incision in the scalpand an incision in the bone,but not necessarily removing a significant amount of bone.It will be an incision right about here.The electrode array itself, you can see it's very thinand it gets slipped through an incision in the boneonto the surface of the brain.Right now, that whole process takes about an hour or two.In the future, it probably will be a little bit quicker.We foresee a future in which this can be doneas a same-day surgery,much as a lot of surgery across the country is done.PiyushKThisSide asks, Think of a futurewhere thoughts and feelings can be completely sharedthrough a brain-computer interface,surpassing the current limits of language.Will such a future be better or worse?I think we will eventually get to that futureand I think it will be a better future.I don't exactly know how we'll get there,and I'm sure there'll be trade-offs,but just like many forms of technologywhere you can't exactly predict what's gonna happen,I think that's the case with brain-computer interfaces.Olydriver asks, Is anybody using AIto create a better brain-computer interface?Definitely, yes.Actually, all brain-computer interfaces todayuse forms of artificial intelligenceas a core part of how the interface works.It's important to understand that basicallythe problem of translating neural datainto actions and interactions with digital technology,that is a translation problem.And that translation between neural code and digital coderequires artificial intelligence and machine learning.But there's so many other applicationsof how artificial intelligence is involved in BCI.It's an extremely important and exciting area.Chrome_Plated asks, How can I get involvedin brain-computer interfaces and neurotechnology?There are a number of ways to get involved,but especially if you're a talented engineer,especially if you're a software engineeror have experience in modern machine learning techniques,I would invite you to apply to workwith any of the companiesthat are working in the space today.Many of them are hiring.All right, that's it. That's all the questions.Hope you learned something.
