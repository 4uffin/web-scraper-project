In fact, the prophet Muhammad’s cousin, Ali Ibn Abi Talib, was passed over for leadership three times, before finally becoming Caliph about 25 years after Muhammad’s death. His rule, however, was highly contested. A civil war broke out, and Ali was ultimately assassinated, setting in motion the split between Shias (the partisans of Ali) and Sunnis that persists to this day.Director: Lisandro Perez-ReyDirector

questions from the internet.This is Middle East Support.[upbeat music]Alright, let's look at the first question.Here's a question from @PatrioticMommy1.Anyone know what Middle East countries are sayingabout the US bombing nuclear sites in Iran?Lot of Arabs in particular don't like the ideaof the United States bombing a Muslim countryin conjunction with Israel.That's a very powerful strain of public discoursein the Arab and indeed Muslim world.But on the flip side, a lot of Arab countriesare afraid of Iran.They're particularly worriedthat the Iranians will use the strengththat they derive from a nuclear weaponto assert their dominance over the region,and so they're not necessarily that opposedto the United States using its military powerto thwart Iranian nuclear ambition.Here's a question from Quora.If you had to make a timeline of major events in the historyof the modern Middle East until today,what events would you put on the timeline?The modern world begins in the 15th centuryaccording to most historians.So you're asking me to pick six events overthe last 500 years?That's really hard to do.The first is 1453, when Mohammed II conquers Constantinoplerenaming it Istanbul, and that really is the beginningof the Ottomans rise to power.They conquer the entirety of the Arab worldand it remains under their control for the next 500 years.The second point I would put there is in 1492,the Spanish Reconquista.The Spaniards force out the Arabswho had been controlling Spain since the seven hundreds.Then I'd come to 1744, a local tribal leaderin Central Arabia, Muhammad Al Saud forges an alliancewith a local religious leadernamed Muhammad Ibn Abdul-Wahhaab,and that gives rise to the kingdom of Saudi Arabiawhose leaders are the descendants of Al-Saud.The other thing it gives rise tois very puritanical understanding of Islamthat we call Wahhabism, the radical ideologythat eventually finds expressionin organizations like Alqaeda.Then I'd come to 1798, Napoleon invades Egypt,one of the beginnings of Western colonialismin the Arab world.The next date I'd come to is 1897,and that is the date of the first Zionist Congressthat decided that the way to cope with the scourgeof antisemitism in Europe was for the Jewish peopleto have a homeland in Palestine,which in the Bible is the ancestral homeland of the Jews.That sets in motion the very tragic strugglethat we're through today between Palestinians and Israelis.Then we come to 1908, and that is when they discoverin the Middle East the commodity that makes it so vitalto the world, and that is black gold or oil.The Middle East is the world's largest producer.The last date, I'm gonna say the end of World War I.It's really when the modern Middle Eastern state systemcomes into being.The British and the French and the allies take overthis part of the world, and they draw the bordersthat today are the source of so much conflict.Let's take another question.Dill_Chips asks, it's been a bit more than six monthssince the Assad regime fell.Have things improved in Syria?It really depends on who you ask.This is the current president of Syria, Ahmed de Sharaa.He was the leader of the militiathat ultimately forced Assad out of Syria,and his militia is actually an offshootof an organization known as Al kigh-duhor as Americans call it Al-Qaeda.It's a measure of how terrible things were in Syriaunder Assad, that this man Sharaa could be viewedby the majority of Syrians as a savior.Though Sharaa has made a lot of the right noisesabout wanting to establish a democracy,about not wanting to see conflict with Syria's neighbors,most notably Israel.He has been pretty brutal internally.So, there was a crackdown against Alawites,it's a religious minority from which Bashar Assad came.Another religious minority that's located in the South,the Druze are also coming under violencefrom militias associated with Sharaa's government.Are things in Syria better than they werewhen Bashar was around?If you ask this handsome gentleman, things are great.Let's take another question.@FulhamFrenchy asks, is Turkey part of the Middle East?The Middle East starts in the west in Moroccoand ends at its Eastern most extent either in Iranor depending on who you ask in Afghanistan.Some people say that actually the Middle Eastis just this part,and we should refer to this as North Africa.So some people will say the Middle East and North Africa.Regardless of which definition you want to use,Turkey is of course in the Middle East,but a little part of it right here is actually in Europe.Turkey has been torn between two camps,one camp that says Turkey is absolutely partof the Middle East.It is one of the biggest and most powerfuland historically consequential Muslim majority countries,and another camp that says Turkey is Europeanand it needs to become more like Europe.The founder of modern Turkey,a guy named Mustafa Kemal Ataturk said, look, World War I,we were totally defeated by the Alliesbecause the Turks were on the side of the Germans.The way we can never let that happen againis to become like the Europeans who defeated us,Ataturk instituted all kinds of reformsto make Turkey more European.One of the big things he did,in Turkey, people used to wear a hat that looked like this.It was called a fez.The reason that lots of Turks wore it is becauseit's a hat that you could wear and still praybecause it didn't have a brim.And Muslims touch their forehead to the groundwhen they pray.Ataturk was so keen on making his country Europeanthat he banned that headgearand said people needed to wear fedoras and hats with Brimsin order to become more like Europeans.That struggle between Ataturk's vision of Turkeyand a more traditional Middle Eastern Muslim versionof Turkey exists to this day.Bigedcactushead asks, why has the US Navy failedto stop the rag-tag Houthis from attacking shipsand protecting the shipping lanes?That's a good question, Bigedcactushead.To answer it, it would be helpfulto look at a topographical map of the Arabian Peninsula.So the Houthis are located here in Yemen.It's very mountainous terrain.It's sort of ideal terrain for a militiathat wants to hide from its enemies.It's very difficult for the Saudis or the Emiratisor for the United States to actually hit the Houthis.The only way that you could actually guaranteethat you would stop the Houthis would be a ground invasion,and this terrain is very difficult.Here's a question for Quora.Why hasn't democracy been working in the Middle Eastso far in so many countries?The only democracy that exists right now in the Middle Eastis the state of Israel.Lots of people argue that even the state of Israelisn't a perfect democracybecause it occupies several million Palestinianswho don't get a vote, and it's an important questionas to why that is the case.Some people point out the United States hasn't necessarilybeen friendly to democracy in the Middle East.We've got all kinds of alliances with Arab leaderswho are not democratic and who are not friendlyto democracy, and that suits us just finebecause we sometimes worry that if there was democracyin the region, it would bring to power a kind of populaceand nationalists who are not terribly friendly to the West.So another set of arguments says,Islam itself is not necessarily friendly to democracy.After all, remember the prophet Muhammad,the founder of Islam,was actually not just a religious leader.He was the ruler of the Muslimsand last time anybody checked,he didn't subject himself to a vote.And then the third set of answershas to do with the nature of Middle Eastern economies.Many of them are heavily dependent on oil,and when you've got oil,it means you basically pull your wealth out of the groundand sell it to foreigners.And what it means is you don't have to tax.Remember no taxation without representation.So in the Middle East you have the kind of the opposite,no demands for representation without taxation.This one is from Smexyrexytitan.It's what is happening in Gaza, truly a genocide.Here's what is incontrovertible.There is a humanitarian crisis in Gazaof massive proportions.People argue about the exact numberof people who have been killed.Is it 50,000?Is it more?Is it less?They argue about whether there's actually a famine going onin Gaza or just the beginnings of a famine.But the fact of the matter is that Gaza is today oneof the most grim places on the planet.The death and destruction that have been meted outon that very small territory,on those very long suffering people is just extraordinaryand there is nobody with a heartwho cannot feel extraordinary pain and griefupon looking at the pictures of what's coming out of Gaza.The question though of whether what is happening in Gazais a genocide is actually a kind of technical questionof international law.So there's a case right now beforethe International Court of Justice,accusing the Netanyahu government of committing genocideagainst the Palestinians.And the International Court of Justice hasn't yet ruledon that, but they have determinedthat there is enough evidence to allow the caseto go forward.In other words, they've concludedthat there's merit to the claim.Some of the merit to the claim they say is foundin the statements of Israeli leaders.Can look at the statementsof Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu in one early speech,analogized Palestinians to Amalekites,which is a group in the Bible that fought the Jewsand had to be defeated.There's Israeli security officials who have referredto the Palestinians as human animals.Even the president of Israel has said there's no such thingas an innocent Palestinianbecause they voted for Hamas 20 years ago.On the flip side, Israelis will point to almost every oneof those statements and say they weren't meant to applyto Palestinians at large.They were meant to apply to Hamas.They say, Palestinians, we don't think Palestinians needto be eradicated.We think Hamas needs to be eradicated.On the one hand,this feels almost like a technical question, you know,let the courts decide what is genocide.But if you look at how this question has really torn apartso many Americans on college campuses, et cetera,it's because on both sides of this question,are normal good well-meaning peoplewho each have deep attachments to one sideor another of this conflict.So this is probably hardest question you could ask.Ottersintuxedos asks,why is there so much oil in the Middle East?You really have to go back millions of years.What is now the Arabian Peninsulawas actually a kind of warm and shallow seathat was full of plant life.That plant life ultimately gets sedimentedlayer upon layer, subject to tremendous heat and pressure,and turns into the hydrocarbons that you know and love.And what's particularly unique about the Middle Eastis not just that there's a lot of oil,but it is very easy to access.So it's very close to the surface.It's not as simple as sticking a straw on the groundand sucking, but it's close.So it's very cheap to extractand that's why the Middle East is reallythe gas station of the world.Here's a question from the NoStupidQuestion subredditasked by ulteriorkid32,4.The United Arab Emirates has the lowest crime rateand the most influx of millionaires.What is their secret?The United Arab Emirates secret really comes downto what I call the three Ls.Location, law, and lubrication.With location, this is where the UAE is locatedin the Arabian Peninsula.It really is at the crossroads of a lot of global trade.The leaders of the UAE recognized this in the 1970sand eighties and they doubled down on turning their countryinto a global trade and logistics hub.They built one of the world's great airlines.If you wanna fly from New York to anywhere in Asiaor South Asia, odds are you're gonna fly through Dubai.So the United Arab Emirateshas some of the most business friendly laws in the worldand they enforce them.If you go to the UAE now and you, for example,sign a contract with somebody in the Emirates,that contract is gonna be enforced.Then we come to the third ingredient in the UAE successand that's lubrication.And by this I mean oil, the UAE is oil richand they use that oil moneyto make their country into the kind of placethat would attract millionaires and foreign investorsand turn it into one of the most exciting partsof the Middle East.@Ryann57429 asks, what's the origin of the conflictbetween Israel and Palestine?So, let's look at a map of this conflict.When we talk about Palestine,we're generally talking about this territory,the West Bank of the Jordan River,and this territory here,the Gaza Strip on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea.When people talk about the land from the river to the sea,this is what they're talking about.Jordan River, Mediterranean Sea.The basic reason for this conflict isthat you have two peoples who are both indigenousto this land between the river and the sea,and who cannot agree on whether to share the landor divide it or how share it or how to divide it.One of the complications here is thatfor most of the last 2000 years,there's only a very small Jewish presence there.The majority of Jews having been expelledabout 2000 years ago after the destructionof the second temple in Jerusalem.The Jews scatter throughout Europe,and we all know the history of the Jewish people in Europe,which is one of great tragedy and triumph.But ultimately, by the 19th century,the Jewish people have been experiencingso much antisemitism in Europe,that a powerful movement emerges to resettlethe land of Palestine.And so Jews start returning in large numbersin the latter half of the 19th century,and they invariably start to bump up against the Arabswho had been living there.In the very beginning,when Jewish immigrants from Europe show up,they have pretty good relations with the Arabsbecause the Arabs find in them source of employment.Arabs were agricultural workers, farmers,and so they would work on the lands purchased by the Jews.A little bit later on, some of the Jews who immigrateto Palestine have a different ideaabout how they wanna live.They say, we don't wanna depend on Arab labor.We wanna become self-sufficient.And if you're an Arab faced with this new kindof Jewish pioneer, you are gonna be upsetbecause they're actually boycotting your labor.Another driver of the conflict between the Arabs and Jews,is that a lot of the Arab land was actually ownedby wealthy landowners who didn't live in Palestine.They lived in more cosmopolitan parts of the Ottoman Empire.And so when Jewish immigrants showed upand wanted to buy land, absentee Arab landowners were happyto sell it to them, selling the land out from underthe native Palestinian Arab farmers who were working on it.So this was almost a perfect storm guaranteedto create a very durable conflict.Mad_Season_1994 asks, What is it about Dubaithat so many dudes find appealingand always wanna go there?One of the ways that Dubaihas attracted so much global talentis by making the country really fun.So if you were to go to Dubai, you'd really find itto be the playground of the Middle East,some of the world's greatest restaurants,hotels and dance clubs and other entertainments.I, for example, went to SeaWorld in Abu Dhabiand it was amazing.There's the tallest building in the world, the Burj Khalifa.Really crazy building projectslike this development that's made out upof reclaimed land in the Persian Gulf.You can't exactly reenact the plotof The Hangover movies there,but it is a very open society.But there is of course, a less appealing side to it.If you are, for example, an Indian guest workerwho's been brought in to Dubaior to any of the cities in the Arabian Gulffrom Doha to Riyadhto build some of these gleaming skyscrapers,you're not having such a good time.You're making money to send back to your family,but you may be living in conditions that are not humane.It's not all fancy nightclubsand Michelin starred mealsfor all of the young men who are in Dubai.This one is from the IsraelPalestine subreddit.How would a two-state solution even work?That's a great question.When we talk about a two-state solution,we're generally talking about a Palestinian statein the West Bank and Gaza.Right off the bat, there's two big problems that emerge.This Palestinian state would be non-contiguous.Got a part here and a part here,and they're separated by Israel.How do you deal with that?How do you actually have free passage of Palestiniansfrom this part of their territoryto this part of their territory without the Israelis feelingthat having a bunch of Palestinians passwithin Israel proper is a security threat?Another problem that jumps right off the bat,the Israelis say, If we also give away the West Bankand we have no security presence in the West Bank,then the entire state of Israel is vulnerable,because there's lots of high lands here in the West Bank.Israelis say, Whoa, we're gonna seed the highlandsso that the Palestinians can just launch rocketsin artillery against us,but that's not even the half of it.Another problem is that this map is a little bit misleadingbecause if we look at a detailed map of the West Bank,this is not one undifferentiated mass of Palestinians.The Israelis have since 1967, been settlingthe Palestinian territory of the West Bankwith Jewish settlers,and there are now about 750,000 Jewish settlersin the West Bank.How would it work?Would you have to expel the Jewish settlers?Can they remain in a Palestinian state and be safe?There's a lot of technical detailsthat have to be worked out.And so when you ask how woulda two-state solution even work?I'd say today in 2025, my answer is, I don't know.I also don't know of any other solution to this problem.Here's a question from NateNandos21.Why does the Middle East have so many wars?If you were to look at a map of the Middle East,you would see that the bordersbetween Arab countries look like straight lines.You can almost see the Britishor French colonial officials standing therewith a ruler and a pen drawing these borders.And that looks very different from the bordersbetween European countries,which tend to follow natural formationslike mountains or rivers.That leads to two kinds of conflict.The first is conflict between states,countries that don't necessarily likewhere the border was drawn when Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.In part that was because they didn't likewhere the British drew the border,and then it also to conflict within states.If you're a Kurd,and you are included in this entity called Syriathat the colonial powers drew,you may be thinking, this is not real.I'm not really a Syrian.We could have drawn this border in another waythat would've given me an independent state of Kurdistan.@tarianrd asks, What is the differencebetween Sunni Muslims and Shia Muslims?The main difference between Sunniand Shia Muslims really goes backto the early days of Islam.The religion,which today counts 1.8 billion people among its followers,was started in the early seventh centuryby a man named Mohammed,who is revered by Muslims as a prophet.When Mohammed died, the Muslim communitywas divided about who would lead them.Some people said,Oh, the prophet Mohammed has this good buddyand father-in-law named Abu Bakr.He should be the one to lead the Muslim community.Whereas others said,Well, the Prophet Mohammed's cousin, Ali ibn Abi Talib,is more suitable for leadership.There was civil war, and the Shias todayare basically the descendants of those who supported Ali.They were called Shiat Ali, the partisans of Ali.And today they make up about 10%of Muslims concentrated in Iran and Iraqwith large populations in Lebanon,large population in South Asia.There's definitely conflict between Sunnis and Shias.For example, Iran and Iraq fought a warthrough the 1970s and early '80s,but of course, there's lots of Shias in Iraqwho fought against Iran.So the idea that the conflict between Iranand other countries is about Iran being Shiaand the other Arab countries being Sunni,that's a very contested idea.Here's a question from @zenith_6_nil.Why is Islam always linked to terrorism?One of the arguments that you might hearfrom other scholars of the Middle Eastis that Muslims are often linked to terrorismbecause Western commentatorshave some prejudice against Islam,and that's why they're much more likelyto call violence by Muslim's terrorismand not apply the same nameto violence committed by any other religious group.Others will point outthat in the last a hundred years or so,inhabitants of Muslim lands have had a lot of reasonto meet out violence against Westerners.After all, the Middle East was subject after World War Ito a series of occupations by western countries,and there's still a very strong Western presencein the Middle East that a lot of Arabs chafe under.We saw this expressed most clearlyon September 11th, 2001,when Al Qaeda attacked the World Trade Center.Their argument for why they did itwas that this was in retaliationfor oppression and violence against Muslims.But there's another group of scholarswho say that the root of the Islamic connectionwith terrorism really goes backto the essence of the religion.And they'll point to chapters in the Holy Text of Islam,this beautiful book, the Quran,which exhort Muslims to engage in Jihador Holy War on behalf of the Muslim community.Some people say that Jihad really here needsto be understood metaphoricallyas a struggle against your inner demons.But others say that, No, when the Quran talks about Jihad,they are talking about fighting warsin order to spread the religion of Islamor to rid Islam of the dominationor oppression of non-Muslims.Here's a question from the AskHistorians subreddit.Why did the US really invade Iraq in 2003?What's the real reasons behind the war?So remember, the Iraq War of 2003 was brought to usby this gentleman, George W. Bush,and it was to unseat Saddam Hussein,who was the dictator of Iraq.There were a couple of big reasons offeredfor why the United States needed to invade Iraq.The first was that Saddam Husseinwas somehow implicated in 9/11.There was also an associated fearthat Saddam Hussein was developing weaponsof mass destruction, most critically nuclear weapons.One of the reasons people thinkthat the war in Iraq was foughtfor other than its stated reasons,after the invasion,we found Iraq didn't have any weapons of mass destruction.So clearly there was something else going on here.Critics of the war, of course, make a third argumentthat it was all about that oil.And if you ask a second question, which is, did it pan out?You'd have to conclude that on almost every metric,the Iraq War was a failure.We didn't get any oil.We got rid of Saddam Hussein who was an enemyof the Iranians and basically empowered alliesof the Iranian regime.And the collapse of Iraq gave rise to all kindsof terrorist groups that continued to wreak havoc in Iraqand in Syria in particular, even to this day.This one's from Lotuswongtko.I heard Iran was really very rich in the 1960s.Was it true?Iran was rich in the 1960s and it's still rich today.Remember, it's a major oil producer.One of the other things you'll hear about Iran in the 1960swas that it was very liberal.You'll see people share photosof women in Iran in the 1960s wearing mini skirtsand having beautiful finely-coifed hairstyles,and contrasting that to todaywhere women in Iran are kept under very tight restrictionswith respect to how they can dress in public.And that really is a result of what happens in Iran,I would say starting in the 1950s.So in 1953, Iran is actually a constitutional monarchy.There's an Iranian leader named Mohammad Mosaddeghwho decides to nationalize the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company.This is the major oil company that's producing Iranian oiland it's owned by the British.America decides to cooperate with the Britishand overthrow him, and we do.But what happens as a result of thatis that America invests very heavilyin an authoritarian regime led by the kingwho called himself the Shah,and that was a very restrictive regime.They were pro-Western, they were modern,but they also did not brook any descent.And it all explodes in the 1979 Iranian Revolution ledby this man, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.And this guy was a religious scholar who believedthat the proper form of governmentis for religious scholars to rule,and he set himself up as Iran's supreme leader,and inaugurates what is now knownas the Islamic Republic of Iran,a country that is run on their understanding of Islamic law.This is from @Salenophile48.Why are there American bases in Qatar?Because look at where Qatar is.It is in such a strategically important territory.You've got Iran here, you've got the oil of the Persian Gulfthat flows through here.So it's very important for the United States,which wants to ensure the free flow of oiland the security of its allies from Iranian adventurismto have a military presence thereto keep the oil flowing and to keep the peace.SocraticTiger asks,Why did America become pro-Israel in the 1960s?So if you're to ask a lot of Palestinians,they would find that to be a weird question.They would say America has been pro-Israelfrom the very beginning.After all, the UN vote that resultsin the international global recognitionof the state of Israel,the US played an important role in lining up the votesfor the state of Israel.The US is one of the first countriesto recognize the state of Israel.The question is right,that something does change in the 1960swhere the alliance between the United States and Israelbecomes much stronger.And I would say a big part of that is the Cold War.During the Cold War where the USis locked in the struggle with the Russians,we're looking for allies around the world.And in that point in time,the Arab countries didn't look like great allies.The oil-producing countriesof the Persian Gulf were definitely pro-American.But then you had countries like Egypt, Syria, Iraq,where they were much more naturally-alignedwith the Soviet Union,both because they were kind of leftist in their orientation,but also because they saw the United Statesas the successor to the former imperial powers,whereas the Soviets talked about ending colonialismand liberating the peoples of the global South.Israel, in contrast,looks like a natural ally of the United States.Culturally, there are similaritiesbecause so many Jewish people came from the West.There's a large Jewish community in the United States,and the state of Israel at that time,unlike any of the Arab countries, was a liberal democracy.Here's a question from the AskMiddleEast subreddit.What is Israel's main goal with invading other countries?Would the Middle East be more peaceful without them?The Israelis actually fight for wars against the Arabs.The first is the War of Independence in 1948,which the Palestinians called the Nakba or the catastrophe.The end of that war results in the mapof Israel looking like this.The Jewish state has captured allof the green territories except for this actually,this is the Golan Heights,and this territory here, the Gaza Strip is controlledby Egypt and this territory hereat the West Bank of the Jordan River, including Jerusalem,is captured by the kingdom of Jordan.Then there was a war in 1956in which Gamal Abdel Nasser,Nasser as he's called in America,he nationalized the Suez Canal.And so the British and the French,with the connivance of the Israelis, attack Egypt.They are eventually pushed outbecause the United States sides with the Egyptians.Then in 1967, Israel launches a preemptive waragainst its Arab neighbors,and that's because Nasser,that dictator in Egypt was saber-rattling.His rhetoric was always very bellicose.He talked about throwing the Jews into the sea.So the Israelis would say in 1967,the reason we quote, Invaded other countriesis because we were facing a threatfrom those other countries.At the end of that war,they had captured not just the Gaza Strip,they captured the entire Sinai Peninsula from Egypt.They captured the West Bank from Jordan,and they captured the Golan Heights from Syria.It wasn't until 1973 when the Egyptians launchan attack on the Israelisin order to recapture the Sinai Peninsula,that the Israelis lose Sinai ultimatelyas a result of a peace dealthat they make with the Egyptians.1982, the Israelis invade Lebanonbecause the Palestinian resistance movementhad relocated to Lebanon,and was launching cross border raids against Israel.The general rationalethat Israeli security analysts will give youis that all of these cross-border conflictsthat Israel is involved in are in order to fend off attacks,that even includes the war in Gaza.Hamas uses their control of Gazato launch rockets in Israel,and then when October 7th happened,that too is another reasonwhy the Israelis say they have to wage this war.There's lots of people who point to the conflictbetween Arabs and Israelas the main source of conflict in the region.It's a major source of conflict,but it's not the only conflict in the Middle East.And you ask this question,would the Middle East be more peaceful without them?The natural answer to is to say,well, why stop at the Israelis?The Middle East could be a lot more peaceful,the world could be a lot more peacefulif there weren't any people.Where you have people, you have conflict.Here's a question from Playful_Interview753.Why the heck are the Saudis building a futuristic cityin the middle of the desert?The question is referring to a citythat the Saudis are building that is called NEOM.This is supposed to be a futuristic citywith beaches that have glow-in-the-dark sand,a hundred mile long linear skyscraper.One of the ambitions that the Saudis haveis to really establish their countryjust like their neighbors in the Emirates didas an attractor for global talent.The Saudi Arabia that I grew up inwas a very conservative society.So when I was growing up in Saudi Arabia in the 1980s,women weren't allowed to drive.Women had to wear concealing black garmentswhen they went outside.And if you were unlucky enough to be caught outsideduring prayer time and you didn't go to the mosque,there would be religious police who would strongly suggestthat you go and pray in the mosque.The current crown prince of Saudi Arabia,Mohammed bin Salman, is trying to change this.And so this project of building this big glitzy cityis an attempt to signal very powerfullythat Saudi Arabia has changedand the new Saudi Arabia has arrived.Here's a question from the Afghanistan subreddit.Why does the Taliban wanna stop women from doing anything?So the Taliban are the religious fanaticswho currently run Afghanistan.They adhere to a particularly puritanical brand of Islamthat believes that women's place is in the homeand not experiencing equal status with men.This is a problem most acute in Afghanistan,but we see it to greater and lesser extentthroughout the Middle Eastand indeed throughout the Muslim world.Lots of people will point outthat in most commonly-accepted understandingsof Islamic law, women are recorded a subordinate status.They may not be as extreme as the Taliban,but for example, one aspect of Islamic law saysthat women should get less inheritance than men.The testimony of women in courtis worth less than the testimony of a man.I personally don't feel that there's anything within Islamthat is inimical to equality for women,but lots of conservative Muslims don't think that way.This is from the Explainlikeimfive subreddit.Explain like I'm five,the difference between kosher and halal.Kosher is the dietary regulation followedby adherent Jews,and halal is a set of dietary regulations followedby Muslims.There's lots of similarities between the two.Kosher, you don't eat anything that has to do with a pig.The same in Halal.There's some areas where halal goes further than kosher.So for example, in Islam,it is not halal to consume alcohol,whereas it is kosher to consume alcohol for Jews.And there are other areaswhere kosher goes a lot further than halal.So for example, in kosher dietary laws,you're not allowed to mix meat and milk.In Islam, there's no such restriction.So a Muslim can have a cheeseburger, an adherent Jew cannot.In Judaism, for example,you're not allowed to eat shellfish.Most Muslims think eating shellfish is totally fine.One of the reasons they overlap is because Islam,like Christianity, descends from Judaism.There's all kinds of waysin which you can observethe practice of contemporary Muslims,and see how it's so similarto the practice of contemporary Jews.For so many hundreds of years,Islam and Judaism develop together.When the Muslims dominated Spain,Jews and Arabs created their individual religious lawsin conversation with each other.And that period of cooperationand that common genealogy is what makesthe conflict between Muslims and Jews todayso much more tragic,but it's also what gives me a little bit of hopethat one day they'll be able to
