We digitally cracked a high security safe.I'm here in Las Vegas for DEF CON,America's biggest Hacker conference.Two of the security researchers I've been talking to hereare James Rowley and Mark Omo,who revealed for the first time on stage of the conferencethat they've discovered not onebut two techniques for cracking a popular lineof electronic locks sold by the China-based firm SECURAM,and used on eight brands of high-end electronic safes.So what was it that got you all startedon this research project that eventually led youto find these two safe cracking techniques?We read the New York Times article in 2023about how the FBI was able to call Liberty Safeand get a code from them.Two years ago, Liberty Safe, which markets itselfas America's number one heavy duty homeand gun safe manufacturer, responded to an FBI warrantby giving agents the combination to open the safeof a criminal suspect in the midstof the Bureau's investigation of the January 6th, 2021invasion of the US Capitol Building.So it really blew me awaythat for this physical security productthat's not internet connected, that the FBI is ableto call a manufacturer and get a code from themand they have the keys to the kingdomto open a safe that you own.Mark and James wanted to understandhow this apparent backdoor worked.So they took a closer look at Liberty Safeand discovered that the company does keep a reset codefor every safe and makes it available to US law enforcementif they have a warrant or a court order.But that was just the beginning of the story.The locks that Liberty Safe used were actually madeseparately by SECURAM, a third party vendor,[Mark] And we focused in on the SECURAM ProLogic locks,their higher end digital series of locks.And one of the most interesting featuresthat caught our eye is they have this reset functionalitywhere you can through a locksmith, reset your lockeven if you've forgotten all the combinations on it.So it turns out that these SECURAM ProLogic locks usedon Liberty Safe safes,but also many other brands have this reset methodand you all cracked it.Yeah, we were able to dump all the firmwareout of the microcontrollerand inside every single safe lock is the secret algorithmthat they use to calculate the codethat you need to reset the lock.And we were able to reverse engineerand replicate it so we can open almost any ProLogic lock.We call that attack reset heist.So can you show us?Yeah, let's do it.For our Safe cracking experiment,we headed to the headquarters of the Red Team Alliance,a Las Vegas-based company focused on physical securityresearch and covert entry instruction.So for this first technique,you all don't even need any tools?Nope, just my phone.Well, how does it work?So let's imagine you own a safe and you forgot your code.You could call a locksmithand they could then communicate with SECURAMto provide that challenge to them,and then they would give back the appropriate responseto reset all the codes on your safe.So this is like a kind of approved interactionbetween an authorized locksmith and SECURAM,but somehow you all cracked it.Yeah, the firmware on this lock has everythingthat we needed to know to recreate that secret algorithmon my phone right here.So we can try the default code from the factory all onesand of course, that doesn't work.[lock clanking]So what we need to do,we're gonna go ahead into this recovery mode here,and we need to type in all nines for the recovery code,and it's gonna show us this challenge on the screen.This is like a series of numbers,and you are gonna copy those into yourprogram here on your phone.Exactly, it's gonna show us the response that we needto provide to the lock here.[Andy] So it's like a challenge numberand then a response number that you type backinto the keypad.That's exactly right.Then it's gonna warn us that we're gonna resetthe whole lock to factory defaults.Of course, we're gonna continue.There we go. All users deleted.So now, it is back in this factory default settingand that 111111 code will actually open it.Yep. Give it a try. Okay.[lock beeping]There we go. Here you go, nice.So is there some easy way for safe ownersto disable that reset mechanism?I mean, that seemed way too easy.Yeah, so safe owners can actually changewhat's known as the encryption code on these locks,and that'll prevent someone from doing thiswithout knowing that code.But SECURAM doesn't recommend changing the codesin its reset method in any online user documentationthe researchers could find.Only in a manual for some locksmiths and manufacturers.In another SECURAM webinar,the researchers found SECURAM suggests changing the codesisn't necessary, and that the codesare usually never changed.We purchased a bunch of these locks from eBayand on every ProLogic lock we bought,these codes were left at the default.This process worked on every single one that we tested.So everybody who has a safe with a SECURAM ProLogic lockcould change the encryption code,which would protect themselves from this technique,which obviously they should do,given how easy that just seemed to be.But you have a second technique, right?Yep, one that's not as easy to protect yourself against.This second, even simpler hacking technique uses a devicethat if it were to become available more widelyor sold online, could leave safes across the US vulnerable.After all, beyond Liberty Safe, SECURAM ProLogic locksare used by a long list of manufacturers,Fort Knox, High Noble, FireKing, ProSteel, Rhino Metals,Sun Welding, Corporate Safe Specialists,and pharmacy safe companies, Cennox and NarcSafe.The locks can also be found on safes used by CVSfor storing narcotics.In a moment, I'm going to try pulling offthis second technique myself to see just how easyit really is.But first, I reached out to SECURAM to find outwhat they've done to fix these vulnerabilities.When I asked SECURAM about this,they told me that they have no plan to fix this at all.In fact, they have a new version of the lockthat they're gonna come out with before the end of the year,but they've essentially said,If you want that more secure version,you just gotta buy a new lock for your safe.It's an interesting approach.As SECURAM's director of sales, Jeremy Brooks told me,we are not going to be offering a firmware packagethat upgrades it.We're going to offer them a new product.In other words, if you want a security update,buy a new lock.SECURAM's CEO, Chunlei Zhoualso wrote in a longer statement to WIREDthat Mark and James's techniques are already knownto security industry professionals.He also said their methods requiredspecialized knowledge skills and equipment.To get a response to SECURAM's claims,I spoke to Babak Javadi a co-founderof the Red Team Alliance,and a professional hacker specializing in physical security.The CEO of SECURAM also told me in a statementthat the techniques that Mark and James have shown hereare already known,Known by who?Locksmiths have always had some sortof insider secret knowledge of some kind.Are they known to the peoplethat it impacts the most, the customers?Because I suspect a lot of people would makedifferent purchasing decisions.The CEO of SECURAM also told me in a statementthat they have never seen a single safe lock defeatedthrough a use of this attack.You don't know what you don't know'cause people don't talk about it.So like maybe he doesn't know, but it's definitely happened.The most sensitive, most important situationswhere this attack would be used, you wouldn't knowbecause it doesn't leave any obvious traces.When you heard about how this works, were you surprisedat how easy it was?I'm not surprised by how easy it was.I think the thing that always strikes me as stupidis any kind of backdoor by design.You can call it a factory recovery methodor customer support tool.Everything with enough focusand resources can be reverse engineered successfully.There's no good reason to put a backdoor in a product,and that's what I have a bigger problem with.So can SECURAM fix this in their code?Can they push out some sort of update or patch?SECURAM on these locks,they're not connected to the internet,so they don't have a way to push firmware updates to them.If new firmware was developed that mitigated these issues,you could go lock to lock with a tool,but it'd be a very manual process.So could just anybody figure outwhat you all have done here?Are you releasing enough informationthat other people could replicate your techniqueand use it for crime?So we're not releasing the techniques that we have.We think the potential for abuse is way too high.But how easy would it be for somebodyto just figure out your techniques and do them themselves?I think it would take about a weekfor someone skilled in the art to execute all the workthat we did and produce a similar tool or similar research.That's a pretty practical risk.Absolutely.[Andy] Now, the researchers are going to demonstratetheir other hack, one that's even harder to defend against.So what are we calling this second trick?We call that one code snatch.Code snatch rather than a phone app type thing.We got a custom tool that we made that is gonna go inthrough the battery door of the lock.So we're gonna start by taking that outand then just inserting this little guy in there,kinda start feeling around for the pins there.Basically, looking for a little debug port in therethat we're able to get the unlock codes out for.There we go. Just like that, we have got the code.So I'm just gonna put the battery back in there.Turn the lock back on. Let it think for a second.Then all we gotta do is type it in.[lock beeping]There we go.So what is this little device that all builtand how is it possible that it can extractthe super code so easily?It's all off the shelf hardware.That is basically just a raspberry pi picowith a little screen on it and some pins up here.We're trying to set those pins on a programming port,which is also a debugging port,and that lets us read out everythingfrom the locks microcontroller,including all the codes that are in the lock.Those codes are stored in an encrypted manner,but we can also read out the keys to decrypt themand we decode that right there on the littleraspberry pi pico and show it on the screen.It's kind of shockingthat the locks keypad itself contains the super code,and all you have to do is find a way to extract it.The firmware in the keypad and the firmware in the latchboth need to be reworked.SECURAM stores the codes in the keypad part of the safe,and really, what needs to happen is those codesneed to be stored inside the safe, behind all the concreteand steel that protects them.So you can't get at them with a toolor something like we did here.If you've created this lock box that is meantto be secure, maybe you should put the sensitive thingslike the combination to open it inside instead.Absolutely. You'd sure think so.So can I give this a try myself?It looked like it took a little bit of finesse.Give it a try yourselfand you can see just how easy it is.Battery out.If any idiot like me can do it, that means that somebodycould start selling this thing on the dark weband then anybody can open one of these safesanywhere in the world.I'm gonna turn it on now. Yeah, go for it.[Andy] I'm pushing the top of it towards me, right?[James] Yeah.Oh, there it is. Hey.Took a minute, but I got it. You know.You got the code. Type it in.[lock beeping][lock clicks] There we go.[James] And that's basically our toolthat opens the high security electronic safe lock.If want a few hundred thousand dollars of fake money.Why did you decide to go public with your techniques?You know, SECURAM's Director of Sales, Jeremy Brooks,says that you are singling out SECURAMand trying to discredit the company.So that's not it at all.We want SECURAM to fix this issue, but more importantly,we want people to be awareof the flaws that they have today.Mark and James are not the first to raise concernsabout SECURAM's locks.Last year, US Senator Ron Wyden wrote an open letterto Michael Casey, then directorof the National Counterintelligence and Security Center.Urging Casey to warn in American businessesthat safe locks made by SECURAM,which is owned by a Chinese parent company,have a manufacturer reset capability that could be usedas a back door, a risk that had already led to SECURAM locksbeing prohibited for government usealong with every other safethat has a manufacturer reset capability.Even as SECURAM locks are widely used in safesin US private companies.When I wrote to the senatorabout the researcher's safe cracking techniques,Wyden sent me a statement.Experts have warned for yearsthat back doors will be exploited by our adversaries.Yet instead of acting on my warningsand those of security experts,the government has left the American publicvulnerable, Wyden rights.This is exactly why Congress must reject callsfor new back doors in encryption technologyand fight all efforts to force US companiesto weaken their encryptionand facilitate government surveillance.When I asked representatives at High Nobleand Liberty Safe, they told me they weren't previously awareof any vulnerabilities in SECURAM locks,but are now reviewing the issueand investigating options including using alternative locks.CVS declined to comment,but said that safety is a top priority.This story is in some ways a familiar onein the security industry.A company builds an and then secure product,refuses to update it,and it takes a couple of white hat hackers to createa proof of concept hacking techniquethat shows us definitively how vulnerable we really are.But there's another lesson here too.If you build a backdoor into someone's secretsfor law enforcement or even for the products creator,it's often just a matter of time until that backdoorbecomes an entryway for uninvited guests too.This is Hack Lab.
