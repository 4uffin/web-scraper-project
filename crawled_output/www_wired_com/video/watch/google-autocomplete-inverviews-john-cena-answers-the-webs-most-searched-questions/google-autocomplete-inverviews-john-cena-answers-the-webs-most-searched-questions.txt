How did John Cena qualify for the Elimination Chamber?By leaning on my resume for the one and only timeI have in my entire lifeand letting everyone know like, heck, this is my last one.I think it's a better event with me in it.In typical WWE fashion, don't try that at home'cause you really only have one of those bridges to burn.And this is my last WrestleMania, so I burned it.Here's a spoiler alert, it worked.How did John Cena? Okay.Win at WrestleMania 41?By being [bleep] awesome.That was my secret sauce. Just a dose of awesomeness.I'm sure the Miz is going to punt me in the nuggetsfor that one.Can John Cena grow facial hair?Not a chance. I haven't shaved in five weeks.I've tried. It shows up in patches.Guys, you know, I can barely grow hair, hair,so facial hair is equally challenging.I did rock a mustache for like a hot minute'cause I tried to grow out my hairand it was like this part doesn't grow,this part doesn't grow, this part doesn't grow.So it looks really bad.Will John Cena be at Summer Slam 2025?Guys, I'm retiring this year.I'm gonna try to get as many appearances as I can.All right, first board's done. Let's get on with the quiz.Here we go, why John Cenais the greatest of all time?Because I say so.And as you know,I also say that winners write the history booksand currently I'm winning, so I'm writing historyand I'm the greatest of all time because I said so.That's a great answer for you parents out there. [laughs]It's not.Why is John Cena style so iconic?Because, what the [bleep]? Is that for real?Uh, okay.So, thanks?Probably because I was stubborn enough not to change.So I wear very small jeans.They don't go be below my kneecap.Jean shorts or jorts.And I just haven't changed that uniform in 20 years.I used to shower in it.And now we're herewhere the jorts are about to make their farewell.And this is me. This is who I am.This is how I'm comfortable.Although I can't move in this coat, I would tear the seams.But it's comfortable.It's not. Help.Gimme some fashion tips.I'm kidding. I won't listen.I'll just show up in a suit or jortsand a t-shirt until December.Okay, why is John Cena in Ambani wedding?Because I was invited.[laughs] What a cool event to go to.Man, they really rolled out the red carpetand threw a huge wedding.I was invited and I wanted to go.I wanted to see what it was all about.I got to travel the world and experience incredible culture.It was an event I'll always remember.So that's why I was there, 'cause I got invited.Okay, here we go. Let's check it out.What did John Cena do to turn heel?That's a good questionbecause I believe I said on televisionthat I'm not a baby face nor heel, I'm a human being.So if you have an answer to this question,it's more personal than practical.What is John Cena WrestleMania?What is John Cena WrestleMania record?This should probably be possessive,what is John Cena's WrestleMania record?I'd like to think I've finished second place a few times,but I don't know how many.Hopefully I've finished firstmore than I've finished second.What I do know is there are no more WrestleMania matchesfor this guy.My last one was a few weeks ago. All righty.What is John Cena's favorite animal?Hell, I don't know.I would just literally be making something up.I don't wanna play favorites in the animal kingdomand I try to not do that.So I do not have a favorite animal.What makes John Cena a hero?Well they say perspective is everything.And if you think someone dressed like a memberof a highly affiliated organized crime family,wearing a pocket watch that doesn't workis somehow aspirationally something you wanna aspire to,that's a great perspective of life and I appreciate that.So thank you so much.All right, that board's done.Who is John Cena,again, we should probably add an apostrophe to this,but that's okay.Who is John Cena best friend in WWE?When you're the 17-time champion,that means you've lost it 16 times.So that is an environment with no friends.I have no allegiances and may God I have mercy on my soul.Who is John Cena's biggest rival?That one's simple. The audience.My goodness, we've been going back and forthfor almost 25 years now.You're tireless. You have an energy of an Everlast battery.I've tried to break you. I can't.You got me on the ropes. This is my last nerve.I've said I'm gonna retire and I will go down swingingtrying to crack your resolvebut dammit, you guys are tough.You are my biggest rival.Who is John Cena best friend in real life?Well, I do have a close crew,but I gotta put the boss first and foremost.That is my wife. I love her and she's my best friend.Who is John Cena's favorite BTS member?This one's gonna set the world a blaze.My favorite BTS member is, hope you got that one.Here we go.Did John Cena actually play the piano in Peacemaker?Yes, that is my haphazard version of Home Sweet Home.I don't remember a note of it, but I did actually play it.I'm trying to learn how to play the piano.I've been trying now for eight years.I still do not know 'cause I practice in my free timeand I have realized by my level of piano,I don't have a lot of free time.But I still have a lot of fun doing it.Does John Cena like anime?I do, but again, not a lot of free time.So the last anime I saw was Fist of the North Star,which is such a cool movie.It's about like a post-apocalyptic societyof martial arts superheroes.It's kind of like pro wrestling,if there was a post apocalyptic WWE universe.Yeah, Fist of the North Star.It's an oldie but a goodie.Does John Cena run his Instagram?[bleep] yes I do.I post one picture every daythat has personal meaning to me.It will never be accompanied with text.You will never see my face.I will never do more than one image a day.Now sometimes the clock is offbecause my day is in let's say Budapest or Moroccoand you're thinking like, oh, he posted twice today.If you're really hawking my account that much,go do something with yourself rather than hawk my account.But it is the way I run my Instagram.I'm very, very proud of it.I run Instagram and x,Facebook's a little bit of a group effort.Threads is me.But yeah, I try to use them all for different things.I'm very proud of the mystery that is associatedwith the Instagram accountant.Best believe it's all meand there's a message in every photo. [humming]All right, that board's done.Thank you for wasting time with me together.I can't wait until the next WIRED Autocomplete Interviewso we can do this again.[upbeat music]Up NextMelissa McCarthy & Kristen Bell Answer The Web’s Most Searched QuestionsNASA Astronauts Answer The Web’s Most Searched QuestionsCommon Answers The Web’s Most Searched QuestionsIce Cube Answers The Web’s Most Searched QuestionsEve Answers The Web’s Most Searched QuestionsSeth Rogen & Rose Byrne Answer The Web’s Most Searched QuestionsThe Cast of Warcraft Answer The Web's Most Searched QuestionsSlow Mo Guys, MatPat, AsapSCIENCE, and Burnie Burns Answer the Web's Most Searched Questions
