It's been a difficult image for Google to shake, despite its successes in turning Android into a more premium brand over the years.Having tested the best Chromebooks and Windows laptops across the spectrum in price, I'm constantly evaluating where Chromebooks are today and if they're worth it, student or not. Here's everything you need to know about how they compare to Windows laptops in the market.Table of ContentsAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWhat Chromebooks Can and Can’t DoChromebook Plus vs. Windows LaptopsWhy Buy a Chromebook in 2025?New Competition AheadWhat Chromebooks Can and Can’t DoOn the surface, Windows laptops and Chromebooks look quite similar. Chromebooks are laptops that come in a variety of sizes, from 13- and 16-inch clamshells to 11-inch tablets. There isn’t nearly as much variety as you’ll find in the Windows ecosystem, which includes categories like gaming laptops, but there's a surprising amount of variety in the Chromebook space. When in doubt, you’ll find the “Chrome” badge on the lid of all Chromebooks, which is the dead giveaway.Software is where things diverge significantly. We’re all familiar with Microsoft’s trusty Windows, but Chromebooks run on Google’s ChromeOS operating system. First announced in 2009, it represents the third primary option to Windows and macOS (outside of Linux). As it’s often been called, ChromeOS remains a glorified Chrome web browser. Everything you can do in a web browser on a MacBook or Windows laptop can be done on a Chromebook.You can have dozens of tabs, you can access extensions, and you can use any web app you need. For many people, this represents the majority of what they do on those laptops anyway. It also has a conventional file system, an app drawer, a desktop, and a lot of the other elements you’d be familiar with coming from Windows or Mac.Photograph: Luke LarsenThe big limitation with Chromebook software is in downloading applications from the web. With Chromebooks, you just can’t. So that means you can't download more advanced software like video editing, photo editing, or industry-specific applications. The only apps you can download are the Android apps you’ll find in the Google Play Store. This can be helpful to fill in the gaps, though most of the web apps will be better solutions, as not all of these apps are well-optimized for touchpads. Fortunately, there are many touchscreen-enabled Chromebooks that feel more natural to control.Because it’s primarily a web browser, Chromebooks aren’t as useful when away from Wi-Fi. You can still use offline mode in some applications like Google Docs, but for the most part, you’ll want to stay connected. These days, I’m not sure that’s too different from how people use Windows laptops.Hardware compatibility is the other big issue you may run into. Most printers, mice, keyboards, and other accessories should work just fine on Chromebooks. In some cases, such as Wacom tablets, there are some models that Google has specifically certified. But again, it’s some of the industry-specific gadgets that will cause problems with Chromebooks. For example, I can’t use my USB colorimeter, which is how I test and calibrate screens. Because there’s no compatible software, that colorimeter doesn’t work. By contrast, Windows is the default native operating system, meaning every application imaginable is available to download.Chromebook Plus vs. Windows LaptopsPhotograph: Luke LarsenPhotograph: Luke LarsenPhotograph: Luke LarsenChevronChevronLenovoChromebook Plus 14$749 Best Buy$749 B&H$650 Lenovo (12 GB)While the best laptop hardware is still found in Windows laptops and MacBooks, Chromebooks are catching up. The “Chromebook Plus” certification has helped over the past couple of years, which is Google’s relatively recent program to increase the hardware standards of Chromebooks.Chromebook Plus models are required to have faster chips, like an Intel Core i3 or AMD Ryzen 3, as well as at least 8 GB of RAM, 128 GB of storage, and a 1080p IPS display. You can find a lot of Chromebook Plus models for around $500, too, such as the Acer Chromebook Plus 515 or the HP Chromebook Plus x360.But this year, the standard got moved up even further with the Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14. As I stated in my review, this is the best Chromebook ever made, going above and beyond the requirements of Chromebook Plus. It’s got a bright OLED display, has a solid webcam and speakers, up to 16 GB of RAM, and up to 256 GB of storage. Even more importantly, it gets fantastic battery life, competitive with some of the latest Windows laptops. For $750, that’s a really solid deal for the hardware. It has a better display than something like the Asus Vivobook 14, and you’d be hard-pressed to find something at this price with better hardware. You can make the argument that you’re getting a more limited software experience, but in terms of hardware, it’s a great value.There is some Windows laptop hardware you’ll never get on Chromebooks, such as discrete graphics. You’re probably not considering a Chromebook if you’re a PC gamer anyway, unless it’s just for game streaming via GeForce Now or Xbox Game Pass.Why Buy a Chromebook in 2025?Photograph: Luke LarsenPhotograph: Luke LarsenPhotograph: Luke LarsenPhotograph: Luke LarsenChevronChevronAsusChromebook CX14$429 $299 (30% off) Best BuyPhotograph: Luke LarsenAsusChromebook CX15$220 $159 (28% off) Walmart (4 GB)$270 AmazonChromebooks are more than just cheap laptops, but that doesn’t mean they don’t excel at those lower prices. Around $500 is the cut-off point for what I’d consider to be truly cheap laptops, and you’ll always have to accept some level of compromise in that tier. Windows laptops under $500 are often bloated, overly thick, poor performers that are both ugly and have disappointing battery life. Most often, they are not good options, even for students.On the contrary, there are lots of Chromebooks under $500 that will do you much better. I recently tested the Asus Chromebook CX14 and CX15, both of which are under $300. These aren’t perfect laptops by any means, with lower-quality screens than I'd like. But as a basic laptop, it’s certainly better than any $300 Windows laptop you’d be able to find.One of the reasons these Chromebooks are so much better is because of how light the operating system is. You just don’t need as much power and battery to get decent performance and battery life on a Chromebook. Windows does it all, but that comes with a cost. That’s beginning to change a bit with the latest Snapdragon-powered Windows laptops, but that doesn’t address laptops under $500. There, Chromebooks still have the better options.Photograph: Luke LarsenBeyond the price comparison, is there really a reason to choose a Chromebook over a Windows laptop? Well, sure. I find the minimalist interface to be attractive on its own. Programmers like it for the built-in Linux environment, while writers (like myself) might be drawn to the restrictions of the operating system. Limitations breed creativity, as they say.The limitations of the software are also good from a security point of view. For children or elderly folks (or anyone newer to computers), the limitations of the software make it safer and easier to use. In addition to the low cost, it’s one of the primary reasons IT administrators continue to find Chromebooks such convenient options for schools and workplaces. They're easier to manage, and it’s much harder to install malicious software on a Chromebook. That doesn’t mean that Chromebooks are impenetrable, but sometimes, simpler is better.Lastly, Google is integrating a lot of interesting AI features directly into ChromeOS. Microsoft and Apple are very much doing the same, but Google’s simpler approach makes those AI features more strongly highlighted. With Chromebook Plus models, Google even throws in a year of Google AI Pro, giving you access to NotebookLM, Gemini integrated into Google apps, and more. It’s a nifty bundle for those who are AI-curious.New Competition AheadWhile Windows laptops aren’t making serious plays at machines under $500, we’ve seen some serious contenders in the $600 to $800 range that have changed the game in the mid-tier market. The Dell 14 Plus is a good example. It only costs $750, but comes with 16 GB of RAM and a terabyte of storage. That’s an incredible deal, especially when you consider the higher-resolution display and excellent battery life.Photograph: Luke LarsenPhotograph: Luke LarsenPhotograph: Luke LarsenChevronChevronDell14 Plus$1,100 $650 (41% off) Dell$988 $900 (9% off) Amazon (258V)Cheap laptops that use the Qualcomm Snapdragon X chip, in particular, are bringing long-lasting battery life we’ve never seen before. The Asus Vivobook 14 is one such example that’s worth looking at. It is frequently discounted to $650, making it an incredible deal considering the 16 GB of RAM and 512 GB of storage. No, the screen isn’t impressive, but it remains the best Windows laptop at that price I’ve ever tested.Heck, even Apple is selling cheap MacBooks these days. The M1 MacBook Air is currently available for just $600, despite having a fantastic IPS screen and world-class components. More than that, Apple is rumored to be launching a $600 MacBook later this year or in 2026, powered by an older A18 chip. That could make recommending some of these more expensive Chromebooks even more difficult.The future of Chromebooks looks rather open-ended these days, though Google recently stated that ChromeOS may merge with Android in the near future. That could really shake things up. But as of now, Chromebooks over $500 are still primarily for Chromebook enthusiasts only, who remain a minority contingent. Fortunately, there are excellent Chromebooks under that price that have recently redefined how good cheap laptops can be—and that’s something Windows laptops have yet to address.CommentsBack to topTriangleYou Might Also Like …In your inbox: Our biggest stories, handpicked for you each dayMeet the guys betting big on AI gambling agentsBig Story: The baby died.
