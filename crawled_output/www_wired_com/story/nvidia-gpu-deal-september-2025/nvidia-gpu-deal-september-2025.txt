The PNY Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 Ti OC (7/10, WIRED Review) is currently marked down to just $379 at Walmart. While prices have been in flux since launch, this is anywhere from $50 to $100 off the usual price, a discount that makes it a much more appealing purchase for gaming at 1080p.Photograph: Brad BourquePNYGeForce RTX 5060 Ti OC$470 $379 (19% off) Walmart$470 NeweggThis is the most modest entry from Nvidia's 50 Series that I think is worth your time, but that doesn't mean that you'll be disappointed. The 16-GB card can chug right along in most modern games at 1080p, beating 60 fps in every game in our test suite with the settings cranked up and the ray tracing turned on. It struggled to keep up at 1440p, at least with everything set to ultra, but a little tinkering, or Nvidia's latest tech, can help with that. Common games like Minecraft, Helldivers 2, and Marvel Rivals all ran over 90 fps, which is great news for weeknight Squirrel Girl enjoyers like myself.As an RTX 50 Series card, the 5060 TI supports the latest version of DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) which includes Multi-Frame Generation. For every traditionally rendered frame of gameplay, the GPU can use machine learning to generate up to three extra frames with low overhead. The result is a much smoother experience, with big fps jumps each time you turn up the setting. The tradeoffs are a slight increase in input lag, as well as the occasional tiny artifact, which I feel makes this a great option for slower, cinematic games, but less optimal for twitchy shooters.This PNY example isn't the flashiest, with a plastic housing and only two fans, but I think a lot of gamers will be satisfied with it. It does feature the classic 8-pin PCIe power plug, so it could be an upgrade for an older system too, but I don't think the performance jump would be that noticeable from the higher-end 30 or even 20 Series cards. If you want to check out your other options, I've got a full GPU buying guide that covers the latest from both AMD and Nvidia, from this card all the way up to the $2,000 RTX 5090.Power up with unlimited access to WIRED.
