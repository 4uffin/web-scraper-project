Amazon is currently offering discounts on both the 256-GB and 512-GB model of the late 2024 Apple Mac Mini (8/10, WIRED Recommends) with the M4 chip.Photograph: Brenda StolyarAppleMac Mini (M4, 2024)$599 $499 (17% off) Amazon$599 Apple$599 Best BuyApple's M4 CPU is at the heart of both versions of this miniaturized desktop, with 10 cores each for the CPU and GPU. Our reviewer Brenda Stolyar had no complaints about the performance, noting that it handled multiple browser tabs, chat programs, and other apps without lagging or slowing down. That's good news, because the memory isn't upgradeable by the user later.Of course the main selling point with the Mac Mini is its tiny footprint. This model has slimmed down from the previous generation's 2.6 pounds to just 1.5 pounds, and has only a 5 x 5-inch body. That's not just small enough to squeeze onto basically any desk or cabinet, but could even sneak into a bag if you need to take it with you to work or on a trip. The only real question mark here is the power button, which is mysteriously underneath the system, so you need to pick it up to turn it on.You'll have to make some compromises when it comes to ports, but it's probably not nearly as bad as you're thinking. The front has two USB-C ports with USB 3.0 support, as well as a 3.5-mm headphone jack for easy access. Around back you'll find three Thunderbolt 4 ports, plus an HDMI connection for your monitor, Ethernet, and power, with USB-A now totally removed from the equation. If you leverage all the ports, you can connect up to three external displays, with support for resolutions up to 6K, depending on your configuration.There are two discounted models, but there's really only a minor SSD storage size difference between the two. The 256-GB model is marked down from $599 to $499, and the 512-GB model is discounted from $799 to $689. We think either one is a great option for casual computer users looking for a lightweight and compact option, but make sure to check out our full roundup of the best Apple Desktop computers if you think an iMac might be more your speed.CommentsBack to topTriangleBrad Bourque is a contributor for WIRED with a focus on computing hardware and peripherals.
