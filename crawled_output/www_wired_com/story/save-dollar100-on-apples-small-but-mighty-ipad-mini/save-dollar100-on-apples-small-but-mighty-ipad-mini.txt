Amazon is offering $100 off the 2024 iPad Mini with an A17 Pro chip, a healthy 20 percent discount for the most recent version of Apple's miniaturized tablet. Our reviewer gave the device an 8/10 last year.Photograph: Brenda StolyarAppleiPad Mini (2024, 7th Gen)$489 Amazon$499 Walmart$499 AppleThe upgraded A17 Pro processor, with six CPU cores and five GPU cores, provides a snappy experience, but more importantly, it helps power Apple's new artificial intelligence features. That includes extra photo editing tools like background removal, proofreading and tone adjustment for your writing, and audio transcriptions for note-taking.Despite its compact 8.3-inch size, the iPad Mini has a nice bright screen, so you can easily read books or watch shows while sitting outside. It only has a 60-Hz refresh rate, however, with other compact tablets and even Apple's other phones making the jump to 90 Hz or higher, but it's far from a deal breaker.Both the front and rear camera have specialized features for their respective roles. Of the two, the front is the more impressive, with a 12-megapixel sensor featuring Apple's Center Stage tech, which automatically keeps you in the frame during video calls and photos, and cinematic video stabilization, so you should have the best looking FaceTime calls around. The rear camera is also a 12-megapixel sensor, with a True Tone Flash and panoramic mode. Both support Smart HDR 4 for excellent depth and effortless photos and videos.It also has great accessory support for a small tablet. In particular, it supports the Apple Pencil Pro, which you can now squeeze to bring up the tool palette for quick and easy access. Unfortunately it doesn't maintain support for the older and more ubiquitous Second Generation Apple Pencil Pro. It is, however, compatible with cases for the older sixth-generation iPad Mini, so you won't have to go out and buy a new one if you're upgrading.No one would blame you for considering one of the larger iPad models, or even an Android option, but if you're already invested in the Apple Ecosystem, this is a solid discount for a small tablet that supports all of the latest iOS features.CommentsBack to topTriangleBrad Bourque is a contributor for WIRED with a focus on computing hardware and peripherals.
