Learn more.If you're in the market for a new television, some of our favorite QLED screens from TCL are almost half off for the start of football season. They're already budget-friendly, so these discounts make them even more appealing as an upgrade, and they feature mini LED technology for impressive brightness.While a variety of models are on sale, I want to focus on the two that have found their way into a few of our favorite television roundups. First up is the TCL QM6K (8/10, WIRED Recommends), a screen that impressed us with its excellent balance, screen uniformity, and color reproduction across the entire panel. It has great off-angle viewing too, if you've got a big or oddly shaped TV room, and has great quality-of-life features, like a dedicated eARC HDMI port for your soundbar.If you have a particularly bright home, or a bigger budget, you might also consider the TCL QM8K (9/10, WIRED Recommends). This upgraded TV is one of the most premium mini LED screens we've had the pleasure of testing, with top-tier colors for the category. It's also exceptionally bright, which is perfect if you're stuck somewhere you can't pull the shades and turn out the lights every time you want to watch a movie.Photograph: Parker HallPhotograph: Parker HallPhotograph: Parker HallChevronChevronTCLQM8K QLED$1,798 $998 (44% off) Walmart$1,800 $1,500 (17% off) AmazonBoth screens have Google TV for their interface, which is one of our preferred platforms for built-in streaming. It's super fast and responsive, and has a massive catalog of apps and streaming options, even if you aren't an Android user. Both the QM6K and QM8K also have impressively thin bezels, which doesn't help performance, but will make these feel a bit more modern hanging on your wall or sitting on your entertainment stand.The 65-inch QM6K is marked down from $1,000 to just $650, a healthy 35 percent discount for an impressive mid-tier television. Meanwhile, the 65-inch QM8K is discounted from $2,500 to $1,500. The discounts should run across official TCL retailers, so I was able to find both the QM6K and QM8K at Best Buy as well, if you'd prefer to try and find one locally, and there are markdowns on both larger and smaller examples as well, with some variation between them.CommentsBack to topTriangleBrad Bourque is a contributor for WIRED with a focus on computing hardware and peripherals.
