Sell your iPhone! That old hunk of glass is more valuable than you might think. A handful of services offer cash or store credit for used iPhones. We’ve compared some popular options for trading in an old device. Most of these services accept Samsung and Google devices, and all of them take iPhones.Updated September 2025: We’ve updated phones and pricing.Table of ContentsAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronTips to Get a High Resale PriceBest for Reliable Cash: GazelleBest for Pristine iPhones: SwappaBest for a Broken iPhone: uSellEasiest Way to Sell: Apple Trade-In ProgramA Few More OptionsTips to Get a High Resale PriceRead MorePhotograph: Julian ChokkattuHow to Back Up Your iPhoneHow to Set Up Your New iPhoneKey iPhone Settings to ChangeIf you want the maximum resale value for your phone, make sure you take care of it. Buy a good case (check out our guide on picking a good phone case) and consider a screen protector. They’ll keep your device looking new, which is the best way to ensure you get the most money possible when you sell.Always buy an unlocked phone. This not only gives you the freedom to switch carriers, but you’ll get more for it when you go to sell it. For the past decade, all iPhones in the US have worked on any wireless network. There’s no reason to chain yourself to one carrier. Generally, unless a carrier tells you a phone is unlocked, it probably isn’t, especially if you buy it on a payment plan.The last thing to do before you run off to cash in your old phone is to back up all your data using iCloud. Be sure to check the option to back up your Messages so iCloud will store your text messages, which sometimes include photos and videos you haven’t saved to your Camera Roll. Remember to unpair your Apple Watch if you have one, and wipe your phone’s data as well.Best for Reliable CashCourtesy of GazelleGazelleTrade-In ProgramShop at
GazelleGazelle is the old hand in the world of used phones. The company has been buying phones since 2006 and has the simplest process we've tested. It also doesn't require you to create an account just to get a quote on your phone.You fill out an online form and answer some questions about your device—whether it works, which carrier it’s tied to, and whether there’s any cosmetic damage. You’ll then get an offer based on the answers you give. If you accept the offer, Gazelle will send a box complete with a shipping label, and you’ll ship the phone in for inspection. Once the company has looked over your device and verified that it’s in the condition you said it was, you’ll be paid—usually in seven to 10 days. Payment can be in the form of a check, PayPal, or an Amazon gift card.A factory-unlocked, 128-GB iPhone 16 in pristine condition will get you $469. A 128-GB unlocked iPhone 15 in lightly used condition will net you about $315. Gazelle sometimes runs promotional offers around new device launches, so keep an eye out to snag the best deal.Best for Pristine iPhonesCourtesy of SwappaSwappaTrade-In ProgramShop at
SwappaSwappa is an online auction house, something like eBay. It eliminates some of the problems associated with eBay, like high seller fees, poor seller-buyer communication tools, and too many poor-quality devices. You won’t be able to sell your iPhone here unless it’s in good shape, fully functional, and undamaged. You'll also have to create an account and link it to your PayPal account before you can even see an offer.So long as your phone meets Swappa’s listing criteria and you’re willing to put in a little effort, this is where you’ll get the most money for your old device. As you would on eBay, you’ll need to put together a listing with photos. Be sure to take the case off your phone, and be honest about the condition. Remember to factor in shipping when setting your sale price.Swappa says iPhone 16 models are selling for around $560. An iPhone 15 is somewhere between $425 and $450, depending on the storage capacity, condition, and how quickly you want to sell it.Best for a Broken iPhoneCourtesy of uSelluSelliPhone for CashShop at
USellIf your iPhone is damaged or the battery no longer holds a charge, uSell will still buy it. Of the send-it-in-style services, uSell offers the most for damaged devices. We were offered $144 for an iPhone 16 that doesn’t even power on. A factory-unlocked, 128-GB iPhone 15 that’s been damaged can get you $177, which isn't bad.It's worth keeping in mind that some carriers have trade-in promotions for phones in “any condition,” though these will inevitably be for an unlocked device and may have some other quirks, like monthly bill credits instead of cash. Still, it's worth exploring that option.Easiest Way to SellPhotograph: Cheng Xin; Getty ImagesAppleTrade InShop at
AppleApple’s Trade-In program doesn't always offer the best prices, but if you’re buying a new iPhone, Apple will quickly apply your credit to the new device. Otherwise, you get a gift card to apply to anything in the Apple Store. Apple pays top dollar only for absolutely pristine phones. At the time of writing, an iPhone 14 in good condition will get you up to $430, while an iPhone 13 can go for up to $370.We don’t recommend it, but if you’re the sort of person who must upgrade to a new iPhone every year, you might save some money using Apple’s iPhone upgrade program. Like a lease, you perpetually pay for your phone every month but get a new one after 12 months, which makes it cheaper than buying a new unlocked phone every year.A Few More OptionsBest Buy: Best Buy offers trade-ins online or in participating stores. It won’t take damaged devices, and you won’t get cash, just store credit. But if you need something from Best Buy anyway, it’s a relatively no-hassle option, especially if you go the in-store route.Carrier trade-ins: Your service provider probably has a buy-back program of some sort, especially if you’re upgrading to a new iPhone. Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile will buy back your device, though generally for far less than the other options in this list. Some promotions accept trade-ins in any condition, but check the fine print.eBay: There’s always eBay. While personal experience has soured me on eBay—scams seem to outnumber legitimate offers—it is still one of the most popular places to sell things online. The site even has a special form for selling your iPhone.Amazon and others: There are other device-centric swapping sites like GadgetGone. Walmart and Amazon also have device trade-in programs, but none of them offer as good a deal as the options above.Facebook Marketplace: Facebook Marketplace has a thriving used goods scene, and we have had luck buying and selling phones on the platform. Make sure you do your market research before you set a price for your phone, be prepared to deal with hagglers, and always make sure you meet buyers in a public location (maybe even let a friend or family member know before you head out). Don't forget to factory reset your iPhone before you hand it over.CommentsBack to topTriangleYou Might Also Like …In your inbox: Will Knight's AI Lab explores advances in AITesla's trillion-dollar bet that it's more than just carsBig Interview: Hasan Piker will never run for officeThe doomers who insist AI will kill us allWatch: Uncanny Valley live with Jack Conte, CEO of PatreonScott Gilbertson is Operations Manager for the WIRED Reviews Team.
