Or, at the very least, better sheets mean I sleep better, whether my dreams are peaceful or a hallucination of failed superpowers and the internet. The choice of bedding can make or break how comfortable you are at night, especially during the hotter seasons of the year.But there's a lot to navigate when buying sheets for your bed. Maybe you're uncertain about which type you need or are frustrated with buying cooling sheets that still leave you sweating. Don't worry: We've slept on almost 100 different bedding sets to find out which ones are the best to sleep on, from crisp percale to silky bamboo and sateen. The right set can make your bed feel like a fresh hotel room, or help you finally achieve a good night's rest without waking up sweaty or uncomfortable.I and my WIRED colleagues have tested dozens upon dozens of options to find the best bed sheets in nearly every style.

You might also see it called a plain weave. It looks like how you might picture a classic weave to look, with an over-under style like a checkerboard. Percale bedding is consistently crisp, cool, and lightweight, and it makes for great cooling sheets. Think of hotel sheets or your favorite button-up shirt to imagine the texture.I wasn't always a percale fan, but The Citizenry's Organic Stonewashed Percale Sheets are one of my favorite sets to sleep on in the summer. The Citizenry uses long-staple cotton that gives it a softer feel than your usual percale sheet, but it's still super breathable to keep me cool on hot nights. This sheet set is also organic with Oeko-Tex and Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS) certifications. (Not sure what that means? We've got a guide for that.)More Percale We LoveAnother fantastic, long-staple set: Buffy's Supima Cotton Percale Sheets ($156) are similar levels of incredibly soft, yet still lightweight and breathable, thanks to long-staple Supima cotton. They're my other summer go-to thanks to how comfortable they keep me on a hot night. They're technically more expensive, but you can usually find them on sale.If you'd like Egyptian cotton: Pure Parima's Ultra Percale Sheet Set for $230 is easily the softest percale I've tried and one of the most comfortable sheet sets because of it. These sheets are a little heavier, so super-hot sleepers might not love them, though they’re lighter than choosing a sateen set while getting a closer level of softness.If you're looking for a truly crisp sheet: Brooklinen's Classic Percale Core Sheet Set ($199) is a great set of percale sheets that have that super crisp feel to them. They do a great job of keeping you cool while you sleep. Plus, the organic version ($239) costs only a little more and feels a touch softer.Curious about more percale bedsheets, or similarly cooling options? There's more percale to explore in our guide to the Best Cooling Sheets.The Best Sateen SheetsPhotograph: Nena FarrellPhotograph: Nena FarrellChevronChevronCoyuchiCloud Soft Organic Sateen Sheet Set$278 CoyuchiSateen is a cotton weave similar to percale, but it uses a three-over-one thread style weave compared to one-over-one. Those extra threads give it a smooth feel even though it's still cotton, and it tends to be both cooler and a little heavier. They're great for summer months if you want something cool to the touch, but they also work for colder months if you aren't looking for something too heat-trapping like flannel but still want to retain some heat.I really like Coyuchi's Cloud Soft Sateen Sheet Set ($278) not just because it lives up to the soft name (which it does!), but these sheets are still breathable for summertime sleeping. Not only that, but these sheets are organic, too, with a GOTS certification that the cotton used is organic. Coyuchi also uses a USDA-certified bio-based softener on these sheets, and it gives them a cozy, lived-in softness compared to silky softness I find on other sateen sheets. I also like that there are undyed options if you're looking to avoid fabric dye—I tested the undyed set, and found it a lovely neutral color.More Sateen Sheets We LoveBest budget sateen: The JCPenney WrinkleGuard Sateen Sheet Set ($80) is soft and cool to the touch, with the silky finish sateen is known for without being slippery. They drape well on my bed and don’t keep me too warm, though they're a little too cozy for summertime. Be careful how you fold them, as they aren't actually wrinkle-free. These sheets technically retail for $200, but are almost always often on sale for around $80Another great set: Brooklinen's Luxe Sateen Core Sheet Set ($199) is similar to JCPenney’s set but more expensive. They’re also a touch silkier thanks to a higher thread count—Brooklinen has 480 versus JCPenney’s 400, so they're a good option if you want something extra soft.An Egyptian cotton splurge: The Pure Parima Triple Luxe Sateen Sheet Set Hotel Collection ($350) is for the people who want the softest bedding possible with Egyptian cotton sheets. The long-staple cotton is Cotton Egypt Association certified, and it's Oeko-Tex certified too. But most important, it's super soft without being overly heavy, and isn't slippery like bamboo or silk. It's a splurge, but if you're craving soft, these are the way to go.The Best Bamboo SheetsPhotograph: Nena FarrellPhotograph: Nena FarrellCourtesy of AeptomChevronChevronAeptomBamboo Sateen Bed Sheet Set$138 AeptomCompanies are making bedding from materials beyond your classic cotton and linen, and instead turning to new options like bamboo. It's made as either bamboo rayon, bamboo viscose, or bamboo lyocell to transform into a fiber and then bamboo bed sheets. Most sets we've tested are 100 percent viscose made from bamboo, though lyocell is the most eco-friendly. It's not a perfect solution eco-conscious option, but bamboo does make for a fantastic soft sheet that's super soft to the touch, plus it's nice and chilly for hot sleepers.Aeptom's Organic Bamboo Sheets ($138) are the best bamboo sheets I've tried for the price. They're lightweight and silky soft, and weren't too hot to sleep on during warm summer nights. These sheets feel just as high-quality as much more expensive sets of bamboo sheets. Aeptom says these sheets use ultra-fine fibers to make the sheets, which makes sense with how light these sheets feel even with a sateen weave.This set also packs both an Oeko-Tex certification and a Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification, certifying the bamboo is responsibly sourced. It's not as highly decorated as Ettitude's bamboo sheets, but it's pretty close and half the price.More Bamboo Sheets We LoveBest cooling (and organic) bamboo: Ettitude's Signature Sateen Sheet Set ($333) feels super lightweight to the touch and don't warm up as much as heavier bamboo I've tried. They're still soft, too, retaining that silky, cool feel bamboo is known for. This set is worth the splurge if you want something that's super soft, breathable, and won't leave you sweating at 3 in the morning. Not only that, but they're the most lauded set of sheets I've tried, with certifications for Oeko-Tex, FSC, Bcorp, Eco-Cert, and Change Climate.Another great set: Luxome's Bamboo Luxury Sheet Set ($190) was our previous top pick, and it's still one of the best value sets you can get for bamboo sheets. It comes with an Oeko-Tex certification and feels fantastic to sleep on. The colors are gorgeous, too.Best on a budget: Bedsure GentleSoft Bamboo Cooling Sheet Set ($64) is one of the best cheap sets of sheets we found from stores like Amazon and Walmart, and it happened to be bamboo to boot. It's made from bamboo rayon (instead of viscose, which is better for the environment) and is impressively comfortable for the cheap price point.If you're interested in more bamboo, check out my guide to the Best Bamboo Sheets.The Best Linen SheetsPhotograph: Nena FarrellPhotograph: Nena FarrellCourtesy of The CitizenryChevronChevronThe CitizenryStonewashed Linen Sheet Set$299 $239 (20% off) The CitizenryLinen is a woven fabric made from flax plants. It’s a highly breathable material and doesn’t trap heat, so it keeps you cool during the summer months. It’s great for people who sleep hot. It’s rougher at first than a simple cotton set, but it should soften up the more it's washed. Linen is often expensive, but it's also more durable than cotton, so a good bedsheet set should last a lot longer. Linen isn't for everyone, but if you love linen clothing, you'll probably love linen sheets.I've slept on a lot of linen (don't miss my entire guide to linen sheets), and the Citizenry's linen set is my Goldilocks of linen bedding. They're lightweight and breathable but still have a nice drape and softness you don't often find in brand-new linen. It usually takes a little breaking in to get to this stage, but the Citizenry's sheets feel like you've already washed them and softened them up. Thanks to great airflow, these sheets are cool enough for warm nights but not so cool that I wouldn’t use them year-round. They're also Oeko-Tex certified, meaning they've been tested for harmful substances and have been deemed harmless. (They aren't GOTS certified, though, so we can't call these sheets fully organic.)The Citizenry's linen not only feels fantastic to sleep on but comes in lots of colors to go with any color scheme your bedroom might have. Parts of the sheet set (just the top sheet, pillowcases, etc.) can be purchased individually if something happens to one of your pieces.More Linen We LoveExtra soft and splurge-worthy linen: Cultiver Linen Sheet Set ($480) is so soft you might not realize it's linen. My husband didn't, and he's a certified linen hater. This set is a splurge, but worth it if you want the benefits of linen and a much softer feel. They're borderline silky, which feels almost wrong to say when describing linen.Best breathable linen: Pottery Barn Belgian Flax Linen Sheet Set ($299) has the most breathable weave I've slept on. The airflow is great, keeping me cool even in the hottest times of year. These sheets have the same weight as the Citizenry's, 160 GSM, but feel more airy and not quite as soft.A great organic find: Organic linen is tougher to track down than organic cotton, and my go-to set is now Coyuchi's Organic Relaxed Linen Sheet Set ($598). It's got a heavier weight at 185 GSM, but feels just as breathable as The Citizenry's and feels fairly soft, too. Coyuchi says it colors its linen sheets with low-impact dyes, and there's an undyed option if you'd like to avoid dyes altogether.Looking for more linen?

But it also is capable of insulating you decently well to keep you warm in the winter months. Silk is also better for your beauty rest and the reason why silk scarves, bonnets, and pillowcases are so popular. It absorbs less moisture from your hair and skin, so you stay hydrated and don't lose all your expensive beauty products to your pillow. It also causes less friction, pulling less at your skin during the night. If you're a side or stomach sleeper where your face makes direct contact with your pillow, silk is a great option to consider. You'll also find that silk is graded not by thread count, but by weight and density, using the term “momme.” A higher number equals more threads, a higher density, and more durability—and a higher price tag.Our favorite silk bedding is these pieces from Lilysilk. They're soft and smooth without being freezing cold. Lilysilk is the only brand of full silk sheets we’ve tested, and it's very expensive to get a full set—you're looking at nearly $700 for one flat sheet, one fitted sheet, and two pillowcases—but the brand offers each piece individually. Former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano tried the fitted sheet with a percale top sheet and found it cooling and comfortable. If you can spend a little more, Lilysilk has 22- and 25-momme sets available. They're a little more durable, but 19 is still very high quality.Other Silk Bedding We LoveOur favorite silk pillowcase: The Quince Silk Mulberry Pillowcase ($45) is a great value at $40, and it has a better weight for that price than other brands. Quince's silk pillowcase is 22-momme, where others usually have a 19-momme for that price, and that heavier weight makes it slightly thicker and softer to the touch. It has a zipper enclosure, which I liked since it kept the pillowcase looking polished, and I didn't have to worry about my pillow wiggling its way out of the case while I tossed and turned in the night.A zipper-free silk pillowcase: LilySilk's 19-Momme Silk Pillowcase ($55) is the same price as the Quince pillowcase, but a lighter weight, though it's barely noticeable side by side. If you prefer no zipper, though, this is the silk pillowcase for you. It does have a few colors and prints that Quince doesn't, so you might want to peruse the two brands and choose based on your color preference.A budget option: Kitsch's Satin Pillowcase ($19) is satin, not silk, but former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano said it's better than similarly priced silk options. If you're not looking to spend more than $20 to $25, she says to choose this one over the cheaper silk pillowcases you'll find on Amazon.The Best Flannel SheetsPhotograph: Nena FarrellCourtesy of Lands' EndChevronChevronLands' EndComfy Super Soft Cotton Flannel Sheet Set$150 Lands' EndFlannel bedding is made of cotton, but the cotton fibers are brushed out to create a fuzzy texture. Those fluffed-out fibers also are what make flannel so warm and cozy to sleep on—the teased layers of cotton do a better job of retaining heat than other styles of cotton sheets, so you'll stay much warmer sleeping on these than other sheet styles. They're great for cooler climates and seasons.These flannel sheets have a long name, but it's an accurate one. This set from Lands' End really is comfy and super soft and was the perfect combination of cozy without being too heavy. I love that these are so soft and warm without making me sweaty—a tall task for a hot sleeper in San Diego, though I did test them during the coldest time of year. I also like that it's easy to buy Lands' End as a set or purchase just a top sheet or pillowcases individually if something needs to be replaced.More Flannel We LoveSplurge-worthy, organic flannel: The Boll & Branch Cozy Flannel Sheet Set ($349) lives up to its name with its extra-soft bedding. Not only is it the softest flannel set I tried, but it's organic, too. It also runs a little warmer, so it's great for colder homes and climates.The popular choice: L.L.Bean's UltraSoft Flannel Sheets ($139) are definitely soft, but not as soft as our top flannel pick, and they feel lighter too. They're almost like a warm jersey rather than a flannel. If you're looking for a light but still soft bedding set, this is a good choice.Best budget flannel: Laura Ashley's Cotton Flannel Sheets ($80) are another lightweight set, and were solidly soft for such an affordable price point. They weren't too warm, but I preferred that as a hot sleeper, or homes that run a heater but still want cozy bedding. They actually reminded me a lot of L.L.Bean, but lighter.Looking for more cozy flannel?

Otherwise, nonorganic sheets can bring the chemicals and materials you avoided—including anything from formaldehyde and TCEP (a flame retardant) to phthalates—right back into your life. Even if you have a regular mattress, you can still benefit from choosing sheets that are made of natural, organic materials. Just about any kind of bedding has potential to be organic, but it depends on how its materials are sourced and what kind of chemicals the fabric is exposed to.My favorite sateen set, Coyu is back as the star of our organic sheets guide. This set uses GOTS certified organic cotton is soft and cozy without being too cozy, and feels like broken-in percale rather than slippery sateen. That's likely thanks to the plant-based (and USDA approved) softener Coyuchi uses on these, and I found myself going back to these again and again during my summer testing.Other Great Organic SheetsSofter, organic percale: The Citizenry's Organic Stonewashed Percale Sheets ($189) has everything I like in a softer percale, using long-staple cotton to make it soft while keeping it ultra soft.Affordable, organic bamboo: The Aeptom Organic Bamboo Sheets ($138) are not only affordable and fantastically comfortable, but pack are Oeko-Tex certified and use FSC certified bamboo for eco-conscious bamboo bedding. While it's a sateen weave, Aeptom uses ultra fine fibers that make this set feel fantastically lightweight.Highly decorated linen: Naturepedic's Organic Linen Sheets & Pillowcases ($499) are a rare find. Organic linen surprisingly tough to find—even primarily organic brands like Avocado don't currently have an organic linen offering. But Naturepedic's has a nice weight to it while still managing to be super breathable, and packs certifications from GOTS, Made Safe, and UL Greenguard.Want to better understand how to shop for organic bedding, and see more options?

I've found that the best contenders for staying cool and keeping away night sweats are percale, linen, and bamboo, but not every set is made equally.This set, however, is none of those. Slumber Cloud's Performance Tencel Sheet Set ($249) uses Tencel, a brand of lyocell fabric, plus Slumber Cloud's patented Outlast fiber, which uses phase change material (PCM) gel to absorb heat. These sheets are a sateen weave with a four-over-one thread structure, but they feel like a lightweight silky percale. I was amazed how cooling and breathable this set is time and time again, even with that type of weave, and so soft at the same time. As a hot sleeper sleeping on the third floor in Southern California, I was so impressed by how cool and comfortable I stayed on these.Other Great Cooling SheetsBest breathable linen: Pottery Barn's Belgian Flax Linen Sheets ($299) have the most lightweight weave of any linen I've tried. Linen in general is a great for breathability, but I loved this set for how extra light it is.My favorite cooling bamboo: Ettitude's Signature Sateen Sheet Set ($333) feels wildly light and breathable without losing the silky feel of bamboo. These also somehow have a sateen weave, but are easily the most breathable bamboo I've slept on.Super breathable, yet soft percale: The Citizenry's Organic Stonewashed Percale ($189) has long-staple cotton to make it much softer than regular cotton percale, but still just as breathable and comfortable in hot seasons.If you're looking for more options as a hot sleeper, check out our guide to the Best Cooling Sheets.Best Affordable SheetsPhotograph: Julia ForbesPhotograph: Julia ForbesCourtesy of BedsureChevronChevronBedsureGentleSoft Cooling Sheets$79 $64 (19% off) Amazon$90 BedsureGreat budget sheets should still last you years to come. The Bedsure GentleSoft Bamboo Cooling Sheet Set ($64) is impressively affordable for a comfortable, long-lasting bamboo set. WIRED reviewer Julia Forbes reaches for it more than any other set she has, and says that these bamboo sheets manage to have a silk-like feel without smothering her in heat. What helps with that is the twill weave, which is similar to percale in that it's one over one threads, but has a diagonal rib pattern that gives it a better drape. It's a slightly warmer weave than percale, but isn't as warm as a three-over-one sateen. This set is more affordable since they use bamboo rayon over bamboo viscose, and viscose is a slightly better process. Still, viscose is a type of rayon, so it's not hugely different.She says Bedsure's GentleSoft have lasted her well after years of use, even with her dogs scratching at them. What was originally an impulse purchase is now one of our favorite bamboo sheet sets, and easily one of the best affordable sets of bedding on the market. It's even got an Oeko-Tex certification, something you don't often see at cheaper price points, and have deep pockets for up to 16 inch mattresses.Other Great Affordable SheetsOften on-sale sateen: The JCPenney WrinkleGuard Sateen Sheet Set ($80) is soft and cool to the touch, with the silky finish sateen is known for without being slippery. This sateen set is supposed to retail for $200, but this set is almost always on sale for around $90, making them a great budget purchase that's still high-quality.Affordable coziness: Laura Ashley's Cotton Flannel Sheets ($80) are a super lightweight flannel set, and were solidly soft for such an affordable price point. I actually prefer them to the popular L.L.Bean flannel.Super cheap cotton: Target's Room Essentials Easy Care Sateen Sheets ($35) lasted me years, even with their insanely cheap price point. They felt like a favorite T-shirt more than true silky sateen, but I was really happy with these for a long time.Comparing Our Favorite BeddingCurious what makes each of our favorite bedding sets different?

The only potential issue here is that, because they are such a dense weave, they sleep a little warmer than what you might be used to. There's also a 400-count version we haven't tested.Avocado Linen Sheets for $494: This linen set is some of the heaviest Gilbertson has tried and will likely last you many years, thanks to the heavy weight. They'll get softer with every wash, but they are initially rougher than other fabrics like cotton. These used to be organic, but they no longer are.Brooklinen Organic Cotton Core Sheet Set for $239: This is a good organic set if you like a crisp, light sheet. It's got both an Oeko-Tex and GOTS certification to confirm this set is organic, and I think the organic set is a touch softer than the non-organic Classic Percale Core Set ($199).Brooklinen Washed European Linen Core Sheet Set for $359: These are Brooklinen's latest version of its linen core bedding, and while they're a solid linen set, our picks are softer (and often a little cheaper, unless these are on sale, which Brooklinen frequently is.)Boll & Branch Signature Sheet Set for $289: Boll & Branch's Signature bedding takes the sateen weave to the next level with a four-over-one thread pattern, making it a little extra soft to the touch. I tested the textured stripe color, which gave it a little texture to balance the softness, and it was a great set to sleep on that wasn't too hot, while still adding a little more weight and softness than lighter cotton.Cariloha Bamboo Classic Sheet Set for $239: These sheets are soft and comfortable, and remind me of the Luxome bamboo, but don't have the securing strap. You can upgrade to Cariloha's Retreat Sheet Set ($339), which is also super soft and comfortable and includes a securing strap.The Company Store Breathable Washed Linen Sheets for $317: These sheets are a great set, and one of our picks in the Best Linen Sheets guide. The sheets have a nice heft to them but are still plenty breathable for summer nights, and parts of the set can be purchased separately if you don't want entirely linen bedding or damage part of your set. It's also Oeko-Tex certified.The Company Store Legends Luxury Luxe Velvet Flannel Fitted Sheet for $85: Velvet flannel is a popular variation of flannel, and my favorite iteration is from the Company Store. The Legends Luxury Luxe set has a fantastic soft feel to it that will keep you very cozy, and the velvet texture feels like quite the upgrade. The only downside is that this sheet is sold in separate pieces, so you'll need to add the fitted ($85) and flat sheet ($100), plus the pillowcase set ($54) to your cart one by one for a full set. But you could also skip the flat sheet if you've already got a duvet cover, or skip the pillowcases if you prefer a silk pillowcase.Coop Percale Sheet Set for $199: This set is crisp, and a similar price to Brooklinen's equally crisp bedding. It didn't stand out otherwise, but wasn't a bad set.Coyuchi Flannel Sheets for $278: These organic bedsheets are fantastic and soft, but the Boll & Branch is a little softer. These are a little cheaper, though, if you want to save a few bucks.Cozy Earth Bamboo Sheet Set for $308: This bamboo set is insanely soft and cold to the touch, with an almost jersey-like coziness to them, rather than a silky feel like sateen. They warm up after about 15 minutes of lying in bed but still almost as if they've melted around you. It's my favorite set to sleep on in the spring and fall. It's a splurge, though, and other similarly priced bamboo sheets come with some organic certifications.Garnet Hill Scallop Flannel for $179: This flannel set is adorable with its scalloped finish on the flat sheet and pillowcases. It's well-priced, too, and very warm and cozy. I liked the lighter feel of Lands' End a little better, but these are another great option.Garnet Hill Supima Flannel for $227: This flannel bedding is made with Supima cotton, making them nice and soft, but you'll have to purchase the fitted and flat sheet separately.Nuzzie Forever Chill Bamboo Sheets for $119: These are my favorite budget cooling bamboo sheets. They're pretty cheap in general for bamboo, and are super lightweight compared to heavier bamboo bedding. These only come in a couple colors, though.Parachute Percale Sheet Set for $259: WIRED reviewer Julian Chokkattu says these sheets feel rough at first but soften up the more they’re washed. He says they've held up extremely well after years of use, even with a dog sleeping in the same bed, but other WIRED staffers haven't had the same experience.Pom Pom at Home Bamboo Sateen Set for $368: This bamboo set is nice, but more expensive than similar quality bamboo you can find.Quince Luxury Signature Sateen Set for $90: This set comes heavily recommended from former WIRED reviewer Haley Sprankle, who said this set is the perfect combination of lightweight and sumptuous. Sateen's three-over-one weave can make it run hot, but our testers did not find that to be the case with this bedding set. It's only available in a twin size now, though, and it's marketed as organic but only has an Oeko-Tex certification.Quince Luxury Bamboo Sheet Set for $130: This set has an affordable price tag, plus a silky feel and an Oeko-Tex certification. (They also list the bamboo used as organic, but don't have any organic or sourcing certifications to pair with it.) They've got a nice weight to them for the price, too.Riley Percale Sheet Set for $260: Riley makes a nice percale set, but they’re pricey—a fitted sheet and pillowcases cost $135, and the flat sheet costs an additional $85. We liked their crispness, but Brooklinen’s are cheaper for even the organic set.Riley's Brushed Cotton Set for $160: This brushed flannel set is soft without being as heavy or hot as full flannel, since brushed cotton only brushes out the cotton on one side of the sheet instead of both sides for regular flannel. This set is a great cozy option for hot sleepers. The queen size is still sold out with a flat sheet, but you can purchase a set without one (and it's cheaper!)Riley Organic Cotton Sheet Set for $260: This was a nice, lightweight set, though my husband and I both had weird dreams for a few nights while sleeping on these. (Maybe it was deeper REM?) The 300 thread count was light, but felt a touch warmer than the other percale I recommend. There's an Oeko-Tex certification listed on the product page, and Riley confirmed the cotton is GOTS certified to make these sheets fully organic.Saatva Percale Sheet Set for $205: I love this percale bedding as much as The Citizenry's. They cost a little more and aren't on sale as often, but both are fantastic percale sets that keep you cool and are crisp while still being soft.Sleep Number True Temp Sheets for $210: These are a good set of cooling sheets. The True Temp felt a little stiff when I initially unboxed them, but softened up immediately after the first night. These sheets feel a little heavier than my top cooling picks, but neither my husband nor I woke up sweaty, and we were both happy with how much softer the set got after that first wash and night on the sheets.Sheets to SkipNot every set we slept on was one we loved. Here are some other sheets we tried and would avoid.Amazon Basics Microfiber Set for $16: We really wanted sub-$20 sheets to be the unexpected hero of our testing, but alas, this set is a failure. They feel (and sound!) kind of like those paper robes you have to wear at the doctor's office. We hardly lasted a night sleeping on these.Casper Hyperlite Set for $139: These are cooling to the touch, thanks to the lyocell Tencel material used, but they are incredibly thin and already feel worn after a handful of washes.Coop Comphy CoolSpa Set for $219: This set promises cooling properties, but I found myself waking up sweating after sleeping on these.Rest Evercool+ Cooling Set for $209: These sheets promised cooling technology, but I found myself kicking them off and getting a sticky, sweaty feeling from them.FAQsWhat Are the Different Fibers Used to Make Sheets?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronCurious about the fibers in your bedding? Here's a breakdown of what you'll usually see on the tag or description, and what it means.Cotton is the most popular fiber option for bedding, and you'll find it in all kinds of weaves (more on that below in construction types). It's long lasting, breathable, and all around a good choice. There's also some variations of cotton, such as long-staple cotton, Egyptian cotton, Supima cotton, and Pima cotton, which are all designations for longer cotton fibers, which make for stronger, softer sheets. While Egyptian cotton usually refers to it simply being from somewhere in Egypt (though there are associations that certify sheets and that it's completely sourced from Egypt, like the Cotton Egypt Association), Supima cotton is actually a brand that grows long-staple cotton in the US.Bamboo is a type of fiber that goes through a chemical process to become fiber. It's either a type of rayon, viscose, or lyocell, which all use regenerated cellulose fibers, aka fibers that began as plant material (like bamboo or eucalyptus) that went through a chemical process to become a fiber and then sheets. Some brands use rayon and viscose interchangeably, even though they're not the exact same process. Lyocell is the most eco-friendly of the lot, but tends to be more expensive.Linen uses flax as its fiber. It has a great structure to it thanks to the firmer flax base, and tends to be really breathable but not as soft to the touch compared to other fabric options.Silk sheets use silk, which are super smooth to the touch. They're very luxurious to sleep on, but tend to be the most expensive compared to other options.Polyester is a synthetic fabric that's affordable, but doesn't feel as nice as natural fibers. We don't recommend any polyester bedding in this guide.What Are the Different Sheet Construction Types?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronNo idea what the terms percale and sateen mean? Here's a quick lowdown of the terms you'll see when shopping for bedsheets that can explain the construction and weave used to make the sheets.Percale is a one-over-one thread pattern that's usually used for cotton bedding. It has the best airflow of cotton, and tends to feel more crisp.Sateen is often cotton like percale, but other fabrics like bamboo will use it too. Sateen uses a three-over-one thread pattern that makes it silky. It's less breathable, but if you're a fan of soft and silky, these are a good choice.Flannel is another type of cotton bedding, but it uses brushed out cotton fibers on both sides of the sheet to create the fluffy feel and warmer experience. Brushed cotton is similar, but only brushes out the fibers on one side, making it a little cooler and thinner than regular flannel.Twill is a diagonal, rib-like pattern that's usually found on cheaper bedding. It uses one over one thread, but isn't as breathable as percale is due to the diagonal design.What Sheet Type Is Best for You?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronIf you're a hot sleeper: Choose from percale, linen, and bamboo sets. Bamboo is softest but can run a little warmer depending on the weave, while long-staple cotton percale can feel soft and super breathable. Linen isn't usually soft, but it's fantastic for airflow and hot climates.If you like sheets soft and silky: Cotton sateen and bamboo sheets are both incredibly soft and silky to the touch. Silk is also super soft, but more expensive.If you like your sheets hotel-crisp: You're looking for cotton percale, my friend. These lightweight sheets feel light and crisp, though long-staple cotton will feel softer than regular cotton.If you're in a cold climate or run cold while you sleep: Flannel is your best choice, or brushed cotton if you're looking for something that's warm but not the warmest you could choose.Does Thread Count Matter?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronThread count might sound like an easy way to tell if sheets are high quality, but in reality, it's not as helpful of a metric as you think. A high thread count will likely make bedding feel silkier to the touch, since there's more threads, but high thread count sheets tend to be less breathable and can signal it uses shorter, low-quality fibers, requiring more fibers to make the sheet rather than longer fibers. My rule of thumb is to aim for sheets between 200 and 400 thread count, especially as a hot sleeper, but you should look for reviews (like this guide has!) to let you know how much breathability and softness you can expect from any set of sheets, since thread count alone can't tell you that.What Are Sheets Certifications to Look For?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronThe main certifications you'll see bedsheets have usually revolve around organic certifications. These can help verify whether a set of sheets is both sourced organically (meaning the cotton, flax, or bamboo was grown organically) and that the sheets aren't made with toxic chemicals. You'll want to look for a Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS), which certifies if the cotton or flax is grown organically, and a certification like Oeko-Tex or Made Safe that confirms the sheets were processed organically.Bamboo doesn't fall under GOTS at this time, so we usually look for a Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification that verifies the bamboo was sourced sustainably. If you'd like to learn more about organic certifications, we've got a guide for that.What Are Grounding Sheets?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronGrounding sheets, also called earthing sheets, have been a growing trend. It's designed to be a sheet that helping you touch grass all night long by connecting you to the electrical charges of the Earth. However, grounding sheets achieve this not by connecting to the ground or outside, but by plugging into a wall. It promises benefits like better sleep, help with chronic pains, and reducing cortisol. There's a following with these products, but we're still investigating the veracity of their claims. For now, it's a trend to watch, but maybe not yet invest in. Instead, make sure you actually go outside to get the benefits of the actual Earth (exposure to the sun helps with circadian rhythm, after all!).Do You Need a Top Sheet?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronTo sleep with a top sheet or not to sleep with a top sheet has been a matter of debate in the past few years, with some opting to speak for a generation. WIRED is divided on this issue, though most of the Reviews team seems to go without. I start out the night with a top sheet but usually find it bunched up in the morning. Former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano is passionate about always sleeping with one. ("This millennial has not killed the top sheet industry," she says.)Do whatever keeps you comfortable. Many companies now offer the option to forgo a top sheet altogether while purchasing a set. If you think you don't like a top sheet because you get too hot, you might just need to find a cooler material.Should You Iron Your Sheets?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronPersonally, I wouldn't iron my sheets, but it is a great way to get a set of sheets to fold nice and flat. Fitted sheets are especially tricky to fold, but my preferred method for folding a fitted sheet comes from the KonMari method. You can see our step by step for folding a fitted sheet here, no ironing required.How Often Should You Clean Your Sheets?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronIt's widely regarded that you should be washing your sheets about once a week according to experts we interviewed, though waiting more like two weeks is also still regarded as an acceptable option. When washing your sheets, every expert we talked to advised against using hot water. “Washing in hot water is more damaging to fibers and reduces the life of your bedding,” explained Tandy Avery, vice president of product development at Luxome. She says using hot water is a common mistake people make when washing sheets. Meanwhile, Parima Ijaz, textile expert and founder of Pure Parima, recommends a gentle cycle to protect the stitching, especially if you have any embroidery you want to protect. Read more in our guide on How to Clean Everything On Your Bed.How Do We Test Sheets?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronYou can guess the first step of this one: it's sleeping! I've slept on almost 100 different sheet sets while testing for this story.I sleep on each set of sheets for anywhere between two to seven nights, depending on how it performs, to see how they hold up and how comfortable they are. I check how well secured they stay on the mattress throughout that week, how well they retain heat (taking the material into consideration; flannel should be keeping me much warmer than percale, for example), and how soft or un-soft they feel after prolonged exposure. I also wash them as soon as they arrive in a normal, cold cycle; check whether the texture has changed at all after a wash; and do the same thing after a week of use. I also keep sheets on hand to compare textures side by side with similar styles of sheets.How Does WIRED Acquire Sheet Samples? What Does WIRED Do With Them After Testing?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronMost of the bedding reviewed in this guide was provided to WIRED by the company, with no obligation to cover or promises of what that coverage would look like. A few sets were also purchased personally by our reviewers, and WIRED will also occasionally purchase samples for our testers if we're unable to obtain a press sample. After testing, the top picks are kept for long-term testing, while others are donated locally.Power up with unlimited access to WIRED.
