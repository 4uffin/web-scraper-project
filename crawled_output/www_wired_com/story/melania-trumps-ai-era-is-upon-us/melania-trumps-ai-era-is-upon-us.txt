Some insiders are excited; others won't touch the subject with a 10-foot pole.Photo-Illustration: WIRED Staff; Getty ImagesCommentLoaderSave StorySave this storyCommentLoaderSave StorySave this storyEven more so than the first time around, Melania Trump’s tenure as first lady thus far has been more notable for her absence than her presence. But that’s beginning to change.The ever elusive first lady, who has been highly sparing in her public appearances, emerged in recent weeks to highlight the newest addition to her slim policy portfolio: artificial intelligence, for the children.First came a confusing video announcement, which included minimal specifics on her new initiative to help American children through AI in education. The only hard bit of information on offer was about a new competition involving students submitting AI-conceived projects to the federal government. (Some, per the White House AI challenge guidebook, will do so on posterboard, while others will “provide a demonstration or video of the technology solution.”) In the video, as an ambient soundtrack straight out of a commercial for a pharmaceutical drug trial plays, she says students can “unleash their imagination and showcase the spirit of American innovation” without explaining what any of that means, telling students to register at AI.gov and wishing them good luck.Then she made a rare appearance alongside her husband at a dinner and glorified grovel-fest with tech executives last week. (Our Brian Barrett described the event as “a bit like thanking the school bully for setting the tone such that you can give him your lunch money.”) Earlier in the day, at an event for her education-themed AI task force—which many of the dinner invitees’ companies are supporting—she talked about the rise of the machines and how “English is a new coding language for many.” In a totally not ominous way, she declared, “The robots are here. Our future is no longer science fiction.”When calling around to my Trumpworld sources following the dinner, it became clear that nobody seems to know what the details of this AI education initiative will entail. Further, with the exceptions of someone in the room for the dinner and a well-connected source in Trumpworld who works in the AI space, everyone else followed standard self-preservation procedures meant to help them last in the president’s orbit.One White House source simply responded with a stand-alone question mark when I texted them asking what they knew about the first lady’s new AI portfolio. Others told me, in so many words, that they weren’t willing to touch anything involving the first lady with a 10-foot pole—a recurring theme in Trumpworld going back to the president’s first campaign and previous term in office.Hocus FLOTUSIn at least some corners of the AI industry, which enjoys increasingly chummy relations with the White House, Melania’s reported desire to become, as the New York Post put it, “the first lady of technology” appears to be welcome news.“It’s really important,” an AI executive familiar with the planning and who has ties in Trumpworld tells me, requesting anonymity to discuss sensitive conversations. “I think by seeing Melania Trump, the first lady, take an interest in this, you really see her focus on the academics and the education and how every student … could have a tutor and that becomes possible with AI at a low cost.”This executive made another prediction: Expect some AI companies to offer a discounted subscription price for their models under the first lady’s plan.Beyond the lack of specifics, however, lies a clue about how the first lady will embrace her removed-yet-not-totally-absent role in Trump’s second term. WIRED has learned that one of the biggest influences on her in getting interested in AI—aside from her son Barron, who is known within Trumpworld to follow cryptocurrencies and other emerging technologies—is a branding expert by the name of Marc Beckman, who hosted Melania on his little-known podcast in October 2024. (Beckman has been characterized as her agent and reportedly helped organize her book deal and handled negotiations for her Amazon documentary; his wife, Alice Roi, happens to be a longtime associate of and occasional designer for the first lady. Beckman was quoted in a Daily Beast story as “a business representative for Melania’s jewelry line” on QVC. He did not return a request for comment, and the White House would not say if he still works for the first lady as her agent.)On the podcast, the first lady spoke extensively about her backstory and her views on technology, and in much more detail than she did in her announcement video or at last week’s dinner. She went as far as identifying as an AI accelerationist, in so many words.Beyond selling NFTs, the first lady also has a memecoin that’s been performing abysmally since its launch, going from a unit price of $8.48 at launch with a $5.6 billion total in volume all the way down to just 2 cents as of this week. (The coin has been trading at under $1 since late February.)Why Melania Chose SolanaAs for how the first lady got into AI in the first place, she told Beckman—who in 2021 wrote a guide to non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, and has since moved on to explaining how AI will change everything—that her interest in emerging technologies began with learning about the blockchain and NFTs. She went on to sell several on the Solana blockchain, which she chose, she told Beckman, because it’s “eco-friendly.”At another point, Beckman—who’s been affiliated with NYU as a senior fellow for emerging technologies and came to the interview dressed like a vampire—asked if she identified more with the camp of those who want to accelerate the growth of AI or as someone who wants to pump the brakes for the sake of safety.Melania Trump didn’t hesitate and effectively identified as a pseudo let-it-rip AI accelerationist while also noting there are downsides to AI, just like there have been with social media, particularly for children.“I would say go ahead. Go fast, go ahead. But maybe we need to look for some restrictions regarding taking advantage of negative and toxic AI,” Melania said, though she did not specify any threats beyond alluding to deepfakes. (She celebrated Congress passing the Take It Down Act, which prohibits the nonconsensual sharing of intimate images as well as deepfakes.)It’s unclear how Melania’s initiative will follow her goals of protecting children from the harms of AI or equipping them for a workforce shaped by the technology. However, my source in the industry tells me the first lady’s involvement is expected to lead to “big commitments from a bunch of these companies” beyond the multibillion-dollar investment figures they’ve already promised the Trump administration.The first lady is just starting her new front-woman role in a Trumpworld AI band that’s been on tour since the beginning of the new administration.David Sacks is running point as the administration’s designated AI adviser and crypto czar, with Thiel Capital alum Michael Kratsios running the Office of Science and Technology Policy. There has been a slew of executive orders on federal AI policy, ranging from directing agencies to remove regulations to the more nebulous, such as preventing “woke AI” from taking hold in the federal government. There’s also the administration’s AI action plan, which outlines policy actions under three pillars: accelerating innovation by removing regulatory barriers, building an infrastructure for AI dominance with data centers and semiconductor manufacturing, and promoting AI standards globally to reduce dependence on foreign (read: Chinese) technology.Melania’s Seat at the TableThe White House did not respond to a list of questions from WIRED about what the first lady’s AI education initiative will entail, what downsides she sees with the technology beyond deepfakes, and whether the US should prioritize supporting more eco-friendly infrastructure. Beckman also did not return a request for comment.A source who was in the room for the AI dinner said the first lady seemed at ease with the tech executives, even if she wasn’t mingling much. In particular, this source noticed Melania seeming to listen attentively to Gerelyn Gilbert-Soto, the significant other of Google cofounder Sergey Brin, who was also in attendance.“Melania, I could tell, was really paying attention when [Gilbert-Soto] was talking,” my source in the room tells me, adding that the first lady was “smiling and way more engaged than when the other tech CEOs were speaking, praising Trump.” Gilbert-Soto did not return a request for comment sent to representatives at Google.For the AI industry, the first lady’s sole foray back into public life being in support of their products is more than welcome news.In that room, there were “some of the most powerful businesspeople in the world who account for a very large percentage of the public market cap of technology and innovation,” the AI industry source in Trumpworld says.“And you have the first lady sitting right next to the president in a room saying, ‘I want to insert myself and be involved in this,’” the executive continues. “And she really hasn’t been involved in much … So now for her to step out and insert herself, I think it’s fairly significant.”This is an edition of Jake Lahut’s Inner Loop newsletter.
