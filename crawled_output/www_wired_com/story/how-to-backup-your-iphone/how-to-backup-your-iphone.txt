Smartphones are how we get work done, stay on top of the crazy news cycle, rock out, keep in touch with friends and family, and capture life’s most important moments.

Make sure you are connected to Wi-Fi, and the process is pretty simple:Open Settings.You can scroll down to select iCloud, or tap [Your Name] at the top and then iCloud.On the iCloud page, scroll down and tap on iCloud Backup. Make sure the switch is toggled on so you’ll get automatic backups every 24 hours when your iPhone is charging, locked, and connected to Wi-Fi. Then tap Back Up Now to force a backup.Check whatever you want iCloud to back up (you can uncheck other categories).Apple gives you 5 GB of iCloud storage for free, but that’s probably not enough to cover all of your data. You can always buy more iCloud storage, though that will draw you deeper into Apple's ecosystem. Luckily, in iOS 15, Apple introduced a temporary method to back up your data to iCloud, even if you are out of storage, to allow you to switch iPhones. If you prefer not to use the cloud, there is another way.Backing Up to Your MacIf your phone is loaded with pictures, songs, apps, and years of text messages, you might want to make a local backup. If you have a computer with some gigs to spare, you can plug in your iPhone and click a few buttons to make sure all your phone's data is safely tucked away. But the exact method depends on your version of macOS.If you're not sure which Apple operating system you have, click the little Apple icon in the top left corner of your Mac desktop and select About This Mac. Another window will pop up, telling you what version you're running.Backing Up to MacOS Catalina 10.15 or LaterThe upgrade to macOS Catalina (2019) did away with iTunes, replacing it with three separate apps for music, podcasts, and TV. The backup option is now located in Finder, where you can search folders and other drives. The steps to back up your iPhone are almost the same as with iTunes:Connect your iPhone to your computer with a cable.Open Finder and select your iPhone under Locations in the sidebar.Click on General and choose Back up all of the data on your iPhone to this Mac.If you want to encrypt your data and password-protect it, select Encrypt local backup.Click Back Up Now.Courtesy of AppleYou can also manage previous backups from here and choose to sync different types of media with your computer while you’re at it.Backing Up to MacOS Mojave 10.14 or EarlieriTunes is not dead yet.

If you'd rather avoid Google, we've rounded up several alternatives here, and there are many other cloud storage services to choose from.
