The complaint, filed in July, alleges Meta has been torrenting and seeding Strike 3’s videos since 2018. Associated exhibits and details of the complaint were unsealed last week.Strike 3 alleges Meta’s motive was partly to obtain otherwise difficult-to-scrape visual angles, parts of the human body, and extended, uninterrupted scenes—rare in mainstream movies and TV—to help it create what Mark Zuckerberg calls AI “superintelligence.”“They have an interest in getting our content because it can give them a competitive advantage for the quality, fluidity, and humanity of the AI,” alleges Christian Waugh, an attorney for Strike 3.The complaint also claims Meta BitTorrented and distributed 2,396 of Strike 3’s copyright-protected porn videos, meaning it allegedly used the BitTorrent protocol to download and distribute large files, which is illegal if the downloaded files are copyrighted. This process made Strike 3’s porn videos accessible to minors, the complaint alleges, since BitTorrent does not have age verification. Meta used and continues to use Strike 3’s porn “for distribution as currency to support its downloading of a vast array of other content necessary to train its AI models,” the complaint alleges.The Exhibits list includes titles Meta allegedly took from a variety of non-pornographic sources, such as episodes of Yellowstone, Modern Family, The Bachelor, South Park, and Downton Abbey, among other mainstream television shows.But it also lists titles of non–Strike 3 porn videos that may include very young actors, such as: ExploitedTeens, Anal Teens, Asian Teen Masturbation, CasualTeenSex, and EuroTeenErotica. The list includes titles relating to weapons, such as: 3D Gun Print and Gun Digest Shooter’s Guide to the AR-15. It also features materials called Antifa’s Radical Plan and, ironically, Intellectual Property Rights in Cyberspace.Using adult content as training data is “a public relations disaster waiting to happen,” says Matthew Sag, professor of law in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science at Emory University. Imagine a middle school student asks a Meta AI model for a video about pizza delivery, he says, and before you know it, it’s porn.Per the lawsuit, Strike 3 has “developed, owns, and operates” infringement-detection systems that allowed it to identify Meta’s alleged violations, which it says took place via 47 distinct Meta-affiliated IP addresses. Based on statutory infringement penalties, the company is demanding $350 million.Christopher Sgro, a Meta spokesperson, told WIRED: “We’re reviewing the complaint, but we don’t believe Strike’s claims are accurate.”According to Meta researchers, its V-JEPA 2 “world model,” released in June, was trained on 1 million hours of “internet video”—a term Strike 3’s complaint points out is left unspecified. The company’s AI ambitions are both grand and rooted in the personal: Zuckerberg has said publicly that Meta plans to put “the power of superintelligence into people’s hands to direct it toward what they value in their own lives.” Meta’s signature smart glasses, for example, are designed to give users “personal superintelligence,” Zuckerberg reiterated at the Meta Connect event on Wednesday.Using pirated material as training data was reportedly an active choice made by Meta executives and approved by Zuckerberg directly. Nearly every major AI company has been accused of similar practices, according to ongoing AI copyright lawsuits.“The case being presented against Meta is perhaps the case of the century because of the sheer scope of infringement,” Waugh says. He claims that Strike 3 has access to a wide selection of copyrighted content that Meta employees allegedly BitTorrented and that the unsealed exhibits represent only “a thin slice of the pie.”AI companies have previously argued that their technologies are transformative, meaning they do not result in the direct copying of rights holders’ works, which should grant them fair use. President Trump has weighed in on this issue in apparent support of tech companies. “You can’t be expected to have a successful AI program when every single article, book, or anything else that you’ve read or studied you’re supposed to pay for,” he said in July.In June, US District Court judge Vince Chhabria ruled that Meta did not violate the law when training its AI models on 13 authors’ copyrighted books in a separate suit, Kadrey v. Meta. However, he explicitly stated his ruling does not mean he found Meta’s use of copyrighted materials to train its AI models to be lawful. Instead, the ruling “stands only for the proposition that these plaintiffs made the wrong arguments and failed to develop a record in support of the right one,” Chhabria said.That means there is potentially room for Strike 3 to make a stronger case. “The best version of their argument is: This is a fundamental problem because, by going to these pirate websites, you are undermining the market for access,” says Sag.To Waugh, this level of alleged corporate copyright infringement touches on a fundamental issue. “It doesn’t matter if it’s a four-sentence poem or adult entertainment," he says. "There is no appetite in this country for what AI companies appear to be doing, which is making money off the backs of rights holders who never gave permission for it.”You Might Also Like …In your inbox: Our biggest stories, handpicked for you each dayMeet the guys betting big on AI gambling agentsBig Story: The baby died.
