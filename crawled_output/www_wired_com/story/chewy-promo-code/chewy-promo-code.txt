Learn more.Florida-based pet food and product online retailer Chewy has been around for less than 15 years but has quickly become a popular source for everything pet-related. Chewy even has supplies for farm animals, reptiles, fish, and more, carrying over 3,500 brands, including everything from food to medicine to toys. My cat is constantly throwing up (same) and requires Hill’s Sensitive Skin and Stomach, which costs roughly as much as my car insurance every month. I use WIRED’s Chewy coupons to save money so I can spring for the 50-cent instant ramen while she can remain vomit-free. Browse our roundup of verified Chewy promo codes and special offers on Autoship and pharmacy orders, BOGO deals, and more.Get $20 Off Sitewide With Today’s Chewy Promo CodesIf you’ve been wanting to see if Chewy is right for you, now's the time to try. First-time users can get a $20 eGift card when they purchase over $49 on their first order at Chewy. Use Chewy promo code WELCOME at checkout to save and see if Chewy’s discounted prices and scheduled auto-ship works for your (and your pet’s) needs. Some exclusions apply. If you’ve never placed an order with their Pharmacy, use Chewy coupon code RX20 at checkout to save 20% on prescription essentials like Simparica Trio, NexGard Plus, Heartgard, and more pet medications.If you’re a returning customer, don’t fret. Chewy has rotating deals on a myriad of pet essentials and supplies, like flea guard, treats, litter, toys, and more. Plus, you can get an extra $5 off on the first order made through the Chewy app with promo code APP. You’ll just need to download the app, and input the above code in the box on the checkout screen for $5 off.Get Sitewide Chewy Free ShippingNew customers can also get free 1-3 day delivery on first-time orders over $35, which seriously helps in cutting down the convenience cost of being able to get your 40-lb litter box to your third-floor apartment without having to lug it on the L train yourself (speaking from experience, don’t endure what I’ve had to). Get the convenience without having to pay for it with Chewy coupons for free delivery on all items.Save 50% With Chewy Coupons and Summer Pet DealsAlready a devoted pet-parent/Chewy member? While often the best Chewy promo codes are reserved for first-time customers, existing customers can score daily deals like buy 3, get 1 free offers on toys. Make sure to stay tuned here, because while our top Chewy promo codes unlock over 20% off, there’s more to look forward to., Expect discount codes still to come like 50% off premium dog and cat food, up to $100 off, an easy price to hit when you’re grabbing pet essentials (not to mention I’ll spend any amount to not lug around boxes of concrete clay litter in the pits of hell, aka the subway in the summer). Surprisingly, some deals don’t require you to apply a code or lift a finger. When you set up an Autoship subscription on products you’ll get 35% off your first order, and up to 50% off featured pet food brands; along with an additional 5% off all future deliveries.How to Use a Chewy Promo CodeOnce you’ve found the Chewy promo code that is the best fit for you and your furry friend, copy the code from above and paste into the box at checkout to watch the savings roll (and sit and stay) in. Check back often for our constantly rotating Chewy promo code and other ways to save on those important, but sometimes expensive, pet essentials.Save on our Favorite Chewy Tech ProductsI’m sort of the cat tech guru around here, and have tested a myriad of the best pet tech like automatic feeders and automatic litter boxes, and I have some very strong opinions about which are worth the money (or not). I’m currently using—erm, my cats are using—the Litter-Robot 4 automatic litter box, and although it’s pricey, this box has changed my life. Gone are the days of foul smells, scooping, and pouring litter. This little machine does all the dirty work for you so that you can spend more time on cuddles. I also own the LEVOIT Core Pet Care Air Purifier which has been a game changer for me living in a cramped apartment with two giant cats—it really helps to dissipate any smells, pet hair or pesky dander. I feel like my house overall feels more clean because of this small powerhouse machine. When I transition from WFH I’m going to invest in this inexpensive camera, INSTACHEW Purrsight 360 Degree Wi-Fi Security Pet Camera, to keep an eye on the goings on and shenanigans while I’m at work.Molly Higgins is WIRED's Commerce Production and Operations Coordinator.
