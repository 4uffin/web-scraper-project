We talk about our work to anyone who will listen—during podcasts, on social media, over dinner with our politely listening friends—but we tend to confine our bragging to the scoops we get, the stories we write. For our new politics issue, though, we decided to do something different and bring WIRED’s work outside, to you, directly.The Politics IssueFor our politics issue, WIRED examines the state of tech’s influence on governmental power—and the people who will change everything in the future.Over the past few days we’ve been posting the cover of our latest issue in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Austin, and Washington, DC. It’s being displayed as wheatpasted posters, digital billboards, and even a mural. Hopefully, they’re easy to spot if not downright hard to miss.Here’s where you come in. We’re not going to tell you exactly where the cover is displayed. (Where’s the fun in that?) Instead, we want you to go on a treasure hunt. If you live in or near one of the five cities listed above, keep your eyes peeled. If you see WIRED’s new cover out in the wild, snap a photo, tell your friends.Also, scan the QR code to read the stories in the politics issue, like editor at large Steven Levy’s deeply reported piece on watching Silicon Valley transform from a countercultural tech utopia to a business sector looking to curry favor with President Trump.
