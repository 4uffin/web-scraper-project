The trouble is, there are hundreds of drive options ranging from dirt-cheap to crazy-expensive—which one is right for your needs? I've tested dozens, across operating systems and with different use cases in mind, to find the best external hard drives for storage, backups, gaming, video editing, network-attached storage (NAS) devices, and more.Check out our other guides, including How to Back Up and Move Your Photos Between Services, How to Back Up Your Digital Life, and How to Back Up Your iPhone.Updated September 2025: We've added the Seagate Ultra Compact SSD, LaCie's new rugged SSD4 and the Corsair EX400U, and we crowned the new Samsung 990 the best internal SSD. We’ve also updated prices and links throughout.Table of ContentsAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronBest for BackupsBest for Portable BackupsBest USB5 DriveBest USB4 DriveBest Budget Portable SSDBest for PhotographersBest Tiny DriveBest Go-Anywhere DriveBest Padded DriveBest Gaming DriveBest Bare DriveBest for BackupsPhotograph: Western DigitalWestern DigitalElements Desktop Hard Drive$170 $150 (12% off) Amazon (8 TB)$150 Adorama (8 TB)For incremental backups, which we recommend, speed isn't a huge factor. That's why the first drive I recommend is this Western Digital Elements hard drive. I have been using a variation of the Elements desktop hard drive to make incremental backups of my data for more than a decade. These drives are big and require external power, but they're some of the cheapest, most reliable drives I've used.Transfer speeds are not off the charts—the Elements drive I tested scored 120 megabytes per second (MB/s) for sequential writes on Windows—but again, you should ideally be running backups overnight anyway, and even at these speeds the average PC backup will be done by morning. These drives use USB-C with support for USB 3, and I've had no problem using them with Windows, macOS, and Linux.Storage options go all the way up to 20 terabytes. Just check the prices; sometimes you can get a 10- or even 12-TB drive for not much more than the 8-terabyte version. And I have not seen a huge difference between the Elements line, the WD My Book drives, or the WD My Passport drives. The My Passport drives command a premium price because they're smaller, and the My Book drives have some encryption features that drive up the price, but I find the basic Elements drive is sufficient for most people.Other Great Backup DrivesSeagate Expansion 8-TB External Hard Drive for $159: Seagate is another reliable drive maker. It never hurts to have more backups, and if you do want multiple backups, use drives from different brands, since it will reduce the chance that both fail simultaneously.Best for Portable BackupsPhotograph: Scott GilbertsonWestern DigitalMy Passport Ultra$90 Amazon (2 TB)$150 Amazon (5 TB)If you travel a lot, you'll want something that's easier to carry than the Elements drives, which aren't the best in a suitcase. For backups when traveling, I love Western Digital's My Passport series, especially the new “Ultra” version, which uses a standard USB-C cord, eliminating the need to carry a separate cable. It's not the thinnest drive on the market, but it's less than an inch thick and solid enough that I never worried about tossing it in my bag. (Although it should be said that this is a spinning drive, so don't literally toss it.) I also like that the corners are nicely rounded and there are no screws or anything else that will catch on fabric in your bag.There are a variety of colors available and you can get from 1 TB to 6 TB. I tested the 5-TB model, but Western Digital claims the same speeds regardless of drive size. I tested it using CrystalDiskMark on Windows, AmorphousDiskMark on macOS, and KDiskMark on Linux and averaged the results to come up with 121 MB/s for read speed and 115 MB/s write speed. It's not what you'd want to copy photos quickly for a client in the field, but fast enough to run a daily backup in your hotel room.Other Portable Backup DrivesWestern Digital Elements 5-TB Portable HDD for $130: This drive is slightly thinner than our top pick, but feels flimsier in my experience. Speeds are tad slower as well, but if you're on a budget this will save you a little cash. Corsair is marketing this as a good way to backup your iPhone ProRes footage, and while it certainly works for that, performance is limited by the iPhone’s USB-C interface. For maximum throughput, connect it to a PC with a USB4 or Thunderbolt 4 port.The Thunderbolt 5 Drive: When Speed Is EverythingPhotograph: Scott GilbertsonLaCieRugged SSD Pro5$525 Amazon (4 TB)$525 Adorama (4 TB)driveLaCie has updated its rugged SSD line with the Rugged Pro5. This one ditches the iconic orange padding for blue, but it is otherwise just like the ordinary LaCie padded drives on the outside. On the inside, this is an amazingly fast drive. The 5 in the name is for, you guessed it, Thunderbolt 5, which despite being announced seemingly forever ago, has been painfully slow to trickle onto the market. This made testing a bit tricky, but fortunately a friend let me borrow his brand-new MacBook Pro 14 for testing. And the results were impressive.LaCie claims read/write speeds of up to 6,700 MB/s and 5,300 MB/s, which it says are enough for real-time editing of 8K and 6K RAW footage. In testing the highest speeds, file transfers were 5,787 MB/s read and 5,188 MB/s write—which, while not quite matching the claim, is still far and away the fastest drive on the page. But raw speeds are just numbers for spreadsheets; I was more interested in real-world performance. Since I happened to also be testing the Nikon Z6III (8/10, WIRED Recommends), which can shoot 6K ProRes RAW, I loaded a good bit of footage on the Pro5 and was indeed able to edit using DaVinci Resolve Studio.The downside here is the price. At $600 for the 4-TB version (which is the minimum you'd want for working with ProRes RAW video files), this is a very pricey drive. It is however, well worth the money if it's speed you're after.Best USB4 DrivePhotograph: Scott GilbertsonCorsairEX400U SSD$200 $180 (10% off) Amazon (2-TB)If you don't yet have any devices with Thunderbolt 5 support, this Thunderbolt 4 drive would be my recommendation for anyone obsessed with speed. Corsair's EX400U is an impressive little drive, consistently delivering speeds of around 3,800 MB/s for sequential read and and 3,550 MB/s write. Again, this is only going to be possible if you have a device that supports USB4/Thunderbolt 4 (including recent Macbooks, Dell XPS, and others—see our guide to the best laptops for more). Technically, just as I was wrapping up this update, Lacie's new rugged SSD came out which beat this drive in my tests by about 10 MB/s, but this drive is smaller, lighter, and cheaper.I also like that Corsair has included a Magsafe connector on the back of the case, which makes great option for backing up ProRes video footage from your iPhone.Best Budget Portable SSDPhotograph: Scott GilbertsonCrucialX6 Portable SSD$147 Amazon (2 TB)These Crucial drives are my favorite general-purpose external storage drives. They're reasonably priced (for a portable SSD) and speedy enough for most uses. The X6 is lightweight and tiny, making it a good choice for working at the coffee shop.This isn't a blinding-fast hard disk. In fact, under the hood, the X6 uses an older drive interface (Serial AT Attachment, or SATA), which was more common with spinning hard drives. So while it's small and light, its speed is limited by that older interface technology. In my testing on Windows and macOS, that works out to about 550 MB/s read speed and 208 MB/s write speed. That's good enough for backup and use as an external drive, but I don't recommend it for Xbox or PlayStation use. It does work fine with the iPad Pro though.The major downside is the plastic construction—it’s a portable hard drive, not an indestructible hard drive. If you're worried about it breaking in your bag, grab a padded case. There are plenty out there, like this one. The Crucial X9 (below) is a step up from the X6, both in terms of build quality (it's metal to the X6's plastic) and speed, but the X9 is considerably more expensive.Other Great Budget DrivesKingston XS1000 2-TB for $130: This tiny little drive is the smallest in this guide. Like the Crucial X6, it has a mostly plastic enclosure, but it has withstood life in my bag quite well. While it's not as robust as the padded options below, it's strong enough for most things. It's also speedy. Kingston claims up to 1,050 MB/s. I never managed that, but I routinely hit around 800 MB/s, with some older laptops closer to 600 MB/s, which is still quite good. The drive bogs down a bit with large files (MP4s, for example), so it's not the best for pro videographers, but for everyone else, this is a solid, slightly cheaper option.Best for PhotographersPhotograph: Scott GilbertsonCrucialX9 Pro SSD$120 Amazon (2TB)$190 $140 (26% off) Adorama (2TB)Crucial's X9 Pro hits the sweet spot of speed, portability, and price to be one of the best drives out there for photographers looking to make backups in the field. These drives are tiny, about half the size of a deck of cards, and weigh a mere 1.3 ounces (38 grams). They'll connect to just about anything. I tested the X9 Pro on Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, and iOS and never hit any issues with any of them. When it comes to speed, the X9 Pro claims symmetrical read and write speeds, at 1,050 MB/s. I actually consistently got higher speeds, up to 1,110 MB/s for read and 1,100 MB/s for write. That puts the X9 Pro at the top of the pack in terms of portable drive speed.I've been testing the X9 Pro for several months now, and while I can't yet speak to the long-term survival rate, I have been testing X6 and X8 drives from Crucial for over two years now without issue. There is also the X10 Pro drive ($165), which offers even faster speeds if you have a PC that supports USB 2X2. (The latest Intel chips support this spec, but Apple does not, so there's no point in buying the X10 Pro if you have a Mac.) I do not own a PC that supports USB 2X2 for extensive testing, but I did get a chance to at least try it, and the X10 Pro does indeed deliver on its promise of 2,100 MB/s (I got it up to 2,050 MB/s). If your hardware supports it, the X10 Pro is worth the extra money.Best Tiny DrivePhotograph: Scott GilbertsonSeagateUltra Compact SSD$100 $90 (10% off) Amazon (1-TB)$180 $140 (22% off) Amazon (2-TB)Seagate's new Ultra Compact SSD straddles the line between USB thumb drive and traditional external drive. The size, design, and built-in USB-C connector make it a thumb drive, but the drive inside is much faster, offering 1,000 MB/s throughput via USB 3.2 Gen 2 (10 Gbps). In my Crystaldiskmark test it managed 1034 MB/s and a write speed of 1018 MB/s, which, while not as fast as some of the new Thunderbolt 5 drives coming on the market, is still way, way faster than most USB sticks. In some ways, performance-wise, this is a more compact, down-market version of the X9 drive above (LaCie is Seagate's high-end, Mac-focused brand). You do get slightly less performance for the money, but the compact, no-cable-needed form factor might be worth it to some people.My one gripe with this drive is that it's on the wide side for a thumbdrive, which means that if your laptop has USB-C ports close together it might cover two. You can mitigate this by ditching the rubber housing, but then you lose some of the protection (the drive with housing is rated to withstand 3 meter drops and is IP54 rated for dust and water resistance).Seagate's Ultra Compact SSD is one of several SSDs adopting the thumb drive form factor. We've also tested and like the SK Hynix Tube 31, which is featured in our guide to the Best USB Flash Drives,Best Go-Anywhere DrivePhotograph: OWCOWCEnvoy Pro Elektron SSD$180 Amazon (1 TB)$180 Adorama (1TB)If you need a drive that can stand up to life in a backpack or camera bag, get wet, or handle a drop onto hard surfaces, OWC drives are your best choice. It's tough to pick a winner here because there are many solid options, but OWC's Elektron drive narrowly beat others in benchmark tests. I also like that you can swap out the drive inside the aluminum casing (it's easy to unscrew), which means two years from now, you can pick up a faster bare SSD and drop it in the hardy Elektron enclosure.Other Great Rugged SSDsSabrent Rocket Nano 2-TB SSD for $207: I really like this one. It's smaller and slightly faster than the OWC, but it has two drawbacks. The first is that it can get hot. If you're trying to work with it in your lap, it can be downright uncomfortable. The other issue is that sometimes it's slow to be recognized by my PC. I could find no pattern to this; sometimes it appeared right away, and other times it took a couple of minutes. If those things don't bother you, this drive is tiny, cheaper, and includes a padded rubber case.Best Padded DrivePhotograph: Scott GilbertsonLaCieRugged SSD4$135 B&H Photo (1 TB)LaCie’s Rugged line of hard drives has been bringing stylish lines to the staid world of SSDs for several decades, and the latest version sees a return to the iconic Neil Poulton design. The new SSD4 (so new it's still in the preorder stage) is similar to last-year's version but adds support for USB4 speeds. My benchmark tests have consistently achieved over 3,400 MB/s read and 3,100 MB/s writes in AmorphousDiskMark (my only USB4 port is on a Macbook Air). That's very much on par with the Corsair EX400U, though as you would expect, it does lag well behind Rugged SSD Pro5 above.LaCie also still makes a traditional spinning-drive version of its rugged drive. If speed isn't an issue, as with making nightly backups on the road, then the cheaper spinning drive makes more sense. If you're backing up in the middle of a photo shoot or similar situation where it needs to happen fast, this SSD version is what you want.Another Great Padded OptionSamsung T7 Shield 2-TB SSD for $149: It isn't as padded as LaCie's rugged drives, but it's cheaper and delivers nearly the same speed. It has an IP65 rating, which means it's fine in the rain and is protected from dust and sand. The T7 line is notable for its built-in security features like hardware-based encryption, but unlike the Touch model, the Shield does not have a fingerprint reader. Still, if you don't need the full padded protection of the LaCie and want to save a little money, the T7 Shield is a good option.Best Gaming DrivePhotograph: Western DigitalWestern DigitalP40 Gaming Drive$159 $130 (18% off) Amazon$200 Adorama (2TB)Take this category with a grain of salt. Most of the drives here will work just fine for gaming (just stick with the fastest you can afford). That said, Western Digital's new P40 does have some cool RGB lights on the bottom if that's your jam. In my testing, that didn't seem to impact power consumption.As for speed, my tests were inconsistent. This drive is capable of speeds that handily beat both the Envoy Pro and Samsung T7, but at other times it seemed to bog down (at least in benchmarks). In real-world use, the bottleneck I consistently hit was some lag in transferring huge amounts of data. That might be a deal-breaker for some, but for the price, it remains a solid choice.Best Bare DriveCourtesy of SamsungSamsung990 PRO SSD Gen4$177 $140 (21% off) AmazonIf you want to put a bigger SSD in your laptop, all you need is a bare drive, which is generally cheaper than the drives with enclosures listed above. The first thing to figure out is which drive your PC uses. Consult your manufacturer's documentation to find out. These days the most common form factor is M.2 2280, which is the long, thin drive in the image above. More compact laptops may use the similar, but shorter, M.2 2242 design. Again, check your PC to confirm the drive it needs before you buy. Of the dozens I've tried, Western Digital's WD Black series has stood out for speed, and it doesn't run very hot.The SN 990 PRO SSD NVMe M.2 PCIe Gen4 achieved speeds of 7,458 MB/s reads in my testing, more or less matching the claimed 7,450 MBs / 6,900 MBs read/write speeds. If you're doing a lot of drive-intensive tasks, like editing video or gaming, this drive is well worth the money. The largest version you can get is 4 TB, and the price is reasonable considering the speed. There are faster drives, but you'll pay for them and I find that currently, beyond this drive there is a diminishing return in the speed vs price curve. I've been using this one as my main drive for several months months now and it works great for editing 5.2K video footage and compiling software. My favorite part? It generates very little heat.Other OptionsWestern Digital SN850X 2-TB SSD for $85: Another fast one, Western Digital claims up to 7,300 MB/s read speeds, and in benchmark tests, this drive's results came close. Like the Samsung above, to take full advantage of the speed here, you'll need a system that supports the PCIe 4.0 SSD standard, but this is a great drive if you want to upgrade a gaming system, whether it's a desktop PC or your PlayStation. This drive is also one of the few I've seen that's available up to 8-TB capacity.Samsung 990 Evo Plus 2-TB for $130: The 990 EVO Plus is an upgrade to the very popular 990 EVO. The original did not offer anything compelling and never made this guide, but the new version manages to be impressively speedy and not overly hot, as many Gen 5 PCIe disks I've tested have been. The 990 EVO Plus also launched with a 4-TB model, something missing the first time around. In terms of speed it doesn't quite match the SN850X above, topping out at 5,677 MB/s read, but it's plenty fast for most uses and remains quite cool even when pushed. If you're looking for a good all-around drive that stays cool, this one makes a good choice, though it is on the pricey side for what you get.Frequently Asked QuestionsHard Drive Buying AdviceAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronPicking the right hard drive comes down to balancing three things: speed, size, and price. If you're making nightly backups, then speed probably doesn't matter. Go for the cheapest drive you can find—up to a point. Drives don't last forever, but some last longer than others. I suggest sticking with known brands with a good reputation, like Seagate, Western Digital, Samsung, and the others featured here. This is based partly on experience and partly on the drive failure data that Backblaze has been publishing for years now. Backblaze goes through massive amounts of hard drives backing up customers' data, and its report is worth reading. The takeaway is simple: Stick with names you know.Which Are the Most Reliable Brands of External Hard Drives?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronThis is difficult to answer, as it depends on too many factors. But if you go by Backblaze's stats report for 2023, the best drive makes are Toshiba, Seagate, Western Digital, and Hitachi (HGST in Backblaze's charts). The current best-performing drives appear to be Seagate's 6- and 8-TB SSDs. With that in mind, if I were building a network-attached storage (NAS) system, the Seagate Exos 8 TB HDD is what I would use. After that though, failures—especially among SSDs—appear pretty random.Which Is Better, SSD or HDD?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronIt depends on what you're doing. If you need fast data transfer speeds, then you want a solid-state drive (SSD). If you have massive amounts of data to store or back up, then a spinning drive (hybrid hard drive, or HDD) is the cheaper option. If you're a videographer, you need both—open your wallet wide. In general, SSDs are the way to go when you can afford it.If speed trumps price, then you want to look at the solid-state drives we've listed here. SSDs don't just have a speed advantage. They also lack moving parts, which means they'll withstand the bumps and falls of life in a bag on the road better than spinning drives. The disadvantage is that they can wear out faster. Every write operation to an SSD—that is, when you save something to it—slightly degrades the individual NAND cells that make up the drive, which wears it out somewhat faster than a spinning drive. Just how much faster depends on how you use it. That said, I have several SSDs that are more than five years old, and I've used them for daily backups throughout that time. None of them have had any problems.Do you need an SSD over a spinning drive? The answer is almost always yes—if you can afford it. But they're especially useful for any drive you're working with regularly: your main boot drive, an external drive you use to edit documents from, and for backups, if you need them to happen fast.The one caveat is that if your Mac or PC doesn't support the same USB standard as the external SSD you're considering, then you might be wasting your money. A drive claiming USB 3.0 speeds in the neighborhood of 2,000 MB/s will do you no good if all your laptop has is USB 2.0 ports. Be sure to check the specs for your laptop, and don't waste your money paying for transfer speeds you'll never see.The other caveat is if you're going to be leaving the drive in an off state for long periods of time—think years, not weeks. In this case SSDs are sometimes more prone to data corruption and traditional hard drives (or tape drives) are a better choice. For most casual users though, this will not be an issue.Which Backup Software Should You Use?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronThe answer depends on whether we’re talking about macOS, Windows, Linux, Android, or whatever Apple operating system you might be using now or in the future. Unfortunately, there is no one solution for everything. We suggest using one (or two) of the storage devices here and some kind of cloud storage backup as well. That way, even if your drives fail, your data is still backed up in the cloud. See our complete guide to backing up your digital life for our top-pick backup solutions for every platform.How We Tested External Hard DrivesAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronI tested these drives by first running them through a suite of benchmarking tools. On Windows, I use CrystalDiskMark to measure both sequential read/write speeds and random read/write speeds. On macOS, I do the same with the Blackmagic Disk Speed Test and sometimes AmorphousDiskMark, and on Linux, I use KDiskMark (and I usually reformat the disk from exFAT to ext4). I run tests six times and then take the average. In addition to benchmarks, I have two folders for testing real-world speeds. I transfer a 25-gigabyte folder of MP3 files, and then a folder with three files that together are 25 gigabytes in size. For top end drives I also test read and write speeds for ProRes RAW video files.Once I've run the tests, I use the drive in day-to-day tasks—editing files directly off it (booting from it in the case of bare drives), making nightly backups, tossing it in my camera bag, and so on. All these data points, along with price, form factor, portability, and other functionality (does it offer encryption, etc.), go into informing the decisions about which disk is best.CommentsBack to topTriangleYou Might Also Like …In your inbox: WIRED's most ambitious, future-defining storiesThe unexpected winners of Trump’s trade warBig Story: The end of handwritingThe dark money group secretly funding Democratic influencersSpecial Edition: Are we healthy yet?Scott Gilbertson is Operations Manager for the WIRED Reviews Team.
