The 2025 Apple iPad (A16) is cute and comes in a few different colors in your choice of 128-, 256-, or 512-gigabyte storage. It has a modern design, USB-C charging, Touch ID, and two 12-MP cameras. It’s powerful enough for most people, and it doesn’t have support for Apple Intelligence (which may be a blessing or a curse). If you primarily use your tablet to watch videos, play mobile games, or do light work, it’ll be just fine (and you won’t overpay for features you aren’t using). One thing to note is that it only supports the first-generation or USB-C Apple Pencil.

They look super cool, with a stylish semi-clear design, on-board touch controls, and a sleek charging case. They pack excellent sound and good noise cancellation, and they’re downright easy to use. The battery lasts about five and a half hours if you’ve got active noise cancellation on. They also pair easily with both Android and iOS devices.

They don’t drop in price very often. Every iteration is small and lightweight, with fast charging speeds (that vary from 15 watts to 65, depending on the size) and a durable finish. Nimble’s power banks are made with bioplastics and have minimal packaging, which helps lessen the environmental impact. They’re also nice to look at.Photograph: Simon HillPhotograph: Simon HillChevronChevronAnkerNano Power Bank$30 $24 (20% off) Amazon$30 $25 (17% off) Amazon (Lightning)$24 Best Buy$24 AnkerWe like this tiny power bank for phones because it’s compact but still delivers a full charge.

It has a built-in kickstand, a two-way USB-C port, and a built-in LED display. You can attach MagSafe iPhones or Qi2 phones in landscape or portrait orientation. It’s not the beefiest power bank in the world, offering about one and a half charges for newer phones, but it’ll definitely come in handy if you just need a quick top-off while on the go—especially since you won’t need to bring your own cable.Photograph: JackeryJackeryExplorer 1000$799 $429 (46% off) Amazon$690 The Home DepotThis portable power station boasts tons of ports and a 1000Wh capacity.
