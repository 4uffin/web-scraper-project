The company actively blocks the web scrapers that crawl websites in order to steal content.DeeperDive represents a bet that harnessing the same generative artificial intelligence technology could help publishers capture readers attention by engaging with them in new ways.The tool replaces a conventional search box and automatically suggests questions that readers might want to ask. For example, today it offers as one prompt, “How does Trump’s Fed policy affect the economy?”DeeperDive generates a short answer to the query along with relevant stories from across the USA Today network. Reed says it is crucial that DeeperDive bases its output on factually correct information and does not draw from opinion pieces. “We only look at our real journalism,” he says.The interface of DeeperDive on the homepage of USA Today

Adam Singolda, Taboola’s CEO, says his firm developed DeeperDive by fine-tuning several open source models.Singolda says DeeperDive benefits from data gathered from across its own network of more than 600 million daily readers across around 11,000 publishers. He says the tool “grounds every answer in articles retrieved from our publisher partners and requires sentence-level citations to those sources” and will avoid generating an output if information from two sources seems to conflict.Gannett’s CEO Reed said ahead of today’s event that, together with Taboola, his firm is interested in exploring agentic tools for readers’ shopping decisions. “Our audiences have a higher intent to purchase to begin with,” he says. “That's really the next step here.”You Might Also Like …In your inbox: WIRED's most ambitious, future-defining storiesThe unexpected winners of Trump’s trade warBig Story: The end of handwritingThe dark money group secretly funding Democratic influencersSpecial Edition: Are we healthy yet?Will Knight is a senior writer for WIRED, covering artificial intelligence.
