Title:
myPhysmatics: Connected Mathematical Models in Physics
Sergej Pankratow
Comments:
This manuscript as a previous one was submitted by his wife Tatjana Znamenski, after S. Pankratow passed away. It was his wish to submit it and I was technically fulfilling this wish. However I could also add myself as a co -author if the system demands since I was helping my husband to pull the text together as many of his colleagues could confirm
