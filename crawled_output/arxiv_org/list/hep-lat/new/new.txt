Title:
QFT on rotating boxes at finite temperature
Sebestyen Nagy, Daniel Nogradi
Comments:

Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Lattice (hep-lat); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
We formulate thermal quantum field theory on a finite spatial periodic volume undergoing rotation. Traditional compactifications at finite temperature without rotations typically involve ${\mathbb T}^4$ as the space-time manifold within a path integral formulation and also moving frames can be accommodated by shifted boundary conditions on the same space. We show that consistent descriptions of a rotating box are possible on space-time manifolds with topology different from ${\mathbb T}^4$ but still flat and without boundary and we classify all possible geometries. The non-trivial topology may be implemented by rotated boundary conditions allowing for a path integral formulation. The purely imaginary angular velocity in temperature units cannot be arbitrary but several discrete values are possible. We also discuss finite volume effects in detail.

Dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) is one of the most standard theoretical frameworks for addressing strongly correlated electron systems. Meanwhile, the concept of holography, developed in the field of quantum gravity, provides an intrinsic relationship between quantum many-body systems and space-time geometry. In this study, we demonstrate that these two theories are closely related to each other by shedding light on holographic aspects of DMFT, particularly for electrons with a semicircle density of states. We formulate a holographic renormalization group for the branch Green's function from the outer edge to the interior of the Bethe lattice network, and then find that its fixed point can be interpreted as a self-consistent solution of Green's function in DMFT. By introducing an effective two-dimensional anti-de Sitter space, moreover, we clarify that the scaling dimensions for the branch Green's function and the boundary correlation functions of electrons at the outer edge of the Bethe lattice network are characterized by the fixed-point Green's function. We also perform DMFT computations for the Bethe-lattice Hubbard model, which illustrate that the scaling dimensions capture the Mott transition in the deep interior.

Title:
Unitarity of 4D Lattice Theory of Gravity

The unitarity of the 4D lattice theory of gravity in the case of the Minkowski signature is proved. The proof is valid only for lattices that conserve the number of degrees of freedom during time evolution. The Euclidean signature and the Minkowski signature are related by the deformation of the integration contours of dynamic variables in a discrete lattice functional integral. It is important that the result is obtained directly on the lattice. Since the studied lattice theory of gravity in the long-wave limit transforms into the well-known Einstein-Cartan-Palatini theory, the obtained result means that this lattice theory of gravity has the right to be considered as a discrete regularization of the generally accepted continuous physical theory of gravity.

Title:
Temperature Dependence of Heavy Quark Diffusion from (2+1)-flavor Lattice QCD

We present a lattice determination of the heavy-quark diffusion coefficient in (2+1)-flavor QCD with almost physical quark masses. The momentum and spatial diffusion coefficients are extracted for a wide temperature range, from $T=163$ MeV to $10$ GeV. The results are in agreement with previous works from the HotQCD collaboration, and show fast thermalization of the heavy quark inside the QGP. Near the chiral crossover temperature $T_c\simeq150$ MeV, our results are close to the AdS/CFT estimation computed at strong coupling.

Title:
Stabilizer Scars

Quantum many-body scars are eigenstates in non-integrable isolated quantum systems that defy typical thermalization paradigms, violating the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis and quantum ergodicity. We identify exact analytic scar solutions in a 2+1 dimensional lattice gauge theory in a quasi-1d limit as zero-magic resource stabilizer states.

Title:
Goldstone bosons at non-zero temperature

Spontaneous symmetry breaking in quantum field theories at non-zero temperature still holds fundamental open questions, in particular what happens to vacuum Goldstone bosons when the temperature is increased. By investigating a complex scalar field theory on the lattice we demonstrate that Goldstone bosons at non-zero temperature behave like screened massless particle-like excitations, so-called thermoparticles, which continue to exist even in the symmetry-restored phase of the theory. We provide non-perturbative evidence for the functional form of the Goldstone mode's dissipative behaviour, and determine its corresponding spectral properties. Since the persistence of thermal Goldstone modes within symmetry-restored phases is predicted to be a model-independent characteristic, this has fundamental consequences for systems in which continuous symmetries are restored at high temperatures.

Title:
Scale Factorized-Quantum Field Theory: An innovative framework for eliminating renormalization ambiguities in QCD and QED

20 pages, LaTeX2e, improved results, additional references added

We introduce Scale Factorized-Quantum Field Theory (SF-QFT), an innovative framework that performs path-integral factorization of ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) momentum modes at a physical scale $Q^*$ before perturbative expansion through Effective Dynamical Renormalization (EDR) with Principle of Observable Effective Matching (POEM) constraints. This approach yields completely scale and scheme invariant observables whose Wilson coefficients $C_i(Q)$ and coupling $a_{\mathrm{eff}}(Q)$ are fixed by matching to the experiment. Because the two-loop $\beta$-function is universal in massless QCD and QED, $a_{\mathrm{eff}}(Q)$ evolves with scheme-independent equations, with higher-order $\beta$-coefficients absorbed into the $C_i$ through EDR implementation. Applying SF-QFT to the inclusive ratio $R_{e^{+}e^{-}}$ gives $R^{\mathrm{SF-QFT}}(31.6\,\mathrm{GeV}) = 1.05262 \pm 0.0005$, which is in excellent agreement with the experimental results ($R^{\mathrm{exp}}(31.6\,\mathrm{GeV})= 1.0527 \pm 0.005$) while requiring calculation that are orders of magnitude lower than those of conventional four-loop $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ approaches. For QED, the same formalism integrates out high-energy modes above $Q^*$, producing scheme-independent predictions for the electron anomalous magnetic moment with unprecedented precision ($a_e^{\text{theory}} = 0.001\,159\,652\,180\,61(76)$), differing from the experiment by only $-1.2(81) \times 10^{-13}$ representing an excellent 0.15$\sigma$ agreement. The framework enables the self-consistent extraction of the natural electromagnetic coupling $\alpha_{\text{eff}}^{-1}(m_e) = 137.036005301$ at the electron mass scale.
