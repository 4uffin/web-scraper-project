A first-order, confinement/deconfinement phase transition appears in the finite temperature behavior of many non-Abelian gauge theories. These theories play an important role in proposals for completion of the Standard Model of particle physics, hence the phase transition might have occurred in the early stages of evolution of our universe, leaving behind a detectable relic stochastic background of gravitational waves. Lattice field theory studies implementing the density of states method have the potential to provide detailed information about the phase transition, and measure the parameters determining the gravitational-wave power spectrum, by overcoming some the challenges faced with importance-sampling methods. We assess this potential for a representative choice of Yang-Mills theory with $Sp(4)$ gauge group. We characterize its finite-temperature, first-order phase transition, in the thermodynamic (infinite volume) limit, for two different choices of number of sites in the compact time direction, hence taking the first steps towards the continuum limit extrapolation. We demonstrate the persistence of non-perturbative phenomena associated to the first-order phase transition: coexistence of states, metastability, latent heat, surface tension. We find consistency between several different strategies for the extraction of the volume-dependent critical coupling, hence assessing the size of systematic effects. We also determine the minimum choice of ratio between spatial and time extent of the lattice that allows to identify the contribution of the surface tension to the free energy. We observe that this ratio scales non-trivially with the time extent of the lattice, and comment on the implications for future high-precision numerical studies.

We test the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) in 1+1-dimensional SU(2) lattice gauge theory (LGT) with one flavor of dynamical fermions. Using the loop-string-hadron framework of the LGT with a bosonic cut-off, we exactly diagonalize the Hamiltonian for finite size systems and calculate matrix elements (MEs) in the eigenbasis for both local and non-local operators. We analyze different indicators to identify the parameter space for quantum chaos at finite lattice sizes and investigate how the ETH behavior emerges in both the diagonal and off-diagonal MEs. Our investigations allow us to study various time scales of thermalization and the emergence of random matrix behavior, and highlight the interplays of the several diagnostics with each other. Furthermore, from the off-diagonal MEs, we extract a smooth function that is closely related to the spectral function for both local and non-local operators. We find numerical evidence of the spectral gap and the memory peak in the non-local operator case. Finally, we investigate aspects of subsystem ETH in the lattice gauge theory and identify certain features in the subsystem reduced density matrix that are unique to gauge theories.

Title:
Neural network approximation of Euclidean path integrals and its application for the $ϕ^4$ theory in 1+1 dimensions

Studying phase transitions in interacting quantum field theories generally requires the numerical study of the dynamical system on an N-dimensional lattice, which is, in most cases, computationally quite the challenging task even with modern computing facilities. In this work I propose an alternative way to solve Euclidean path integrals in quantum field theories, using radial basis function-type neural networks, where the nonlinear part of the path integral is approximated by a linear combination of quadratic path integrals, therefore making the corresponding problem analytically tractable. The method allows us to calculate observables in a very efficient way, taking only seconds to do calculations that would otherwise take hours or even days with other existing methods. To test the capabilities of the model, it is used to describe the phase transition in the 1+1 dimensional interacting real scalar $\phi^4$ theory. The obtained phase transition line is compared to previous lattice results, giving very good agreement between them. The method is very flexible and could be extended to higher dimensions, finite temperatures, or even finite densities, therefore, it could give a very good alternative approach for solving numerically hard problems in quantum field theories.

Title:

We present here the first lattice simulation of symplectic quantization, a new functional approach to quantum field theory which allows to define an algorithm to numerically sample the quantum fluctuations of fields directly in Minkowski space-time, at variance with all other present approaches. Symplectic quantization is characterized by a Hamiltonian deterministic dynamics evolving with respect to an additional time parameter $\tau$ analogous to the fictious time of stochastic quantization. The difference between stochastic quantization and the present approach is that the former is well defined only for Euclidean field theories, while the latter allows to sample the causal structure of space-time. In this work we present the numerical study of a real scalar field theory on a 1+1 space-time lattice with a $\lambda\phi^4$ interaction. We find that for $\lambda\ll1$ the two-point correlation function obtained numerically reproduces qualitatively well the shape of the free Feynman propagator. Within symplectic quantization the expectation values over quantum fluctuations are computed as dynamical averages along the dynamics in $\tau$, in force of a natural ergodic hypothesis connecting Hamiltonian dynamics with a generalized microcanonical ensemble. Analytically, we prove that this microcanonical ensemble, in the continuum limit, is equivalent to a canonical-like one where the probability density of field configurations is $P[\phi]\propto\exp(zS[\phi]/\hbar)$. The results from our simulations correspond to the value $z=1$ of the parameter in the canonical weight, which in this case is a well-defined probability density for field configurations in causal space-time, provided that a lower bounded interaction potential is considered. The form proposed for $P[\phi]$ suggests that our theory can be connected to ordinary quantum field theory by analytic continuation in the complex-$z$ plane.

We review recent progress in Monte Carlo simulations of dense two-color QCD (QC$_2$D), focusing on the phase diagram, the equation of state, and the sound velocity in the low-temperature regime. In three-color QCD at finite density, especially at low temperatures, the notorious sign problem makes lattice Monte Carlo simulations intractable. In contrast, QC$_2$D is free from this issue due to the pseudoreality of the quark representation. Recent independent lattice studies have revealed unexpected phenomena through first-principles calculations of the phase structure and thermodynamics. A particularly notable finding is that the sound velocity exceeds the so-called conformal (holography) bound, \( c_s^2/c^2 \le 1/3 \), which had not been observed in QCD-like theories at finite temperature. In this review, we focus primarily on results from a series of works by our group~\cite{Iida:2019rah, Iida:2020emi,Iida:2022hyy, Ishiguro:2021yxr, Iida:2024irv}, along with related studies in dense QC$_2$D and three-color QCD with isospin chemical potential. We discuss the possibility and physical implications of conformal bound violation even for three-color dense QCD, together with insights from effective model analyses and recent observations of neutron stars.
