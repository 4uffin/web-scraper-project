Title:
A Unified Neural-Network Framework for Nucleon Imaging from Numerical Simulations of QCD

Parton distributions encode the momentum-space structure and, in their generalizations, the spatial tomography of quarks and gluons inside hadrons, the building blocks of visible matter. We present a unified neural-network approach that learns these distributions directly from matrix elements calculated via numerical simulations of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) on the lattice by fitting two complementary inputs simultaneously: data matched to physical quantities via known momentum-space and coordinate-space formalisms. Utilizing data from both methods stabilizes the extraction and mitigates biases that can arise when either is used alone. We validate the method on controlled mock data and apply it to lattice-QCD matrix elements to extract parton distribution functions (PDFs). We show benefits of such an approach for determining the physical quantities. We further extend the framework to zero-skewness generalized parton distributions and demonstrate nucleon tomography within the same neural-network parameterization. Our results provide an adaptable and systematically improvable approach for extracting partonic distributions from Euclidean correlators. It can incorporate polarization, additional channels, and future experimental constraints from current and future facilities, such as the Electron-Ion Collider.

Title:
Hamiltonian truncation and quantum simulation of strong-field QED beyond tree level

Quantum electrodynamics in strong background fields provides an interesting class of problems for classical and quantum simulation. In this paper we formulate simulations of polarization (helicity) flip for a photon colliding with a high-intensity plane wave. Polarization flip is a one loop effect, which requires addressing new issues that do not arise in simulations of tree-level processes. Working in the momentum-space Fock basis, while convenient for the extraction of scattering amplitudes, requires tuning counterterms to cancel large cutoff effects. We compute analytic formulas for the counterterms at one loop. We then construct circuits for quantum simulations of the process, perform noiseless simulations on classical computers to assess discretization errors, and discuss resource estimates for future simulations on quantum hardware.

Title:

Mass and full decay width of the hadronic tensor molecule $\mathcal{M}_{ \mathrm{T}}=B_c^{\ast +}B_c^{\ast -}$ are examined in the framework of QCD sum rule method. To find the mass $m$ and current coupling $\Lambda$ of this state, we use the two-point sum rules. The result $(12.87 \pm 0.08)~\mathrm{ GeV}$ for $m$ indicates that $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{T}}$ can easily decay to pairs of $J/\psi \Upsilon $, $\eta_{b}\eta _{c}$, $B_{c}^{+}B_{c}^{-}$, and $ B_{c}^{\ast +}B_{c}^{\ast -}$ mesons. Kinematically permitted ways for $ \mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{T}}$ to transform to conventional mesons include also processes $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{T}} \to D^{(\ast)+}D^{(\ast )-}$, $D^{(\ast )0}\overline{D}^{(\ast )0}$, and $D_{s}^{(\ast)+}D_{s}^{(\ast)-}$ triggered by annihilation of $b\overline{b}$ quarks in the molecule. The decays to meson pairs $B^{(\ast)+}B^{(\ast )-}$, $B^{(\ast )0}\overline{B}^{(\ast )0}$ , and $B_{s}^{(\ast)0}\overline{B}_{s}^{(\ast )0}$ generated by $c\overline{c } \to $ light quarks are also among possible channels of the hadronic molecule $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{T}}$. Technical tools of the three-point sum rule approach are applied to compute partial widths of these decays. Our results for the mass and width $\Gamma_{\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{T}}}=(154 \pm 19)~ \mathrm{MeV} $ of the tensor molecule $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{T}}$ are important for experimental studies of fully heavy exotic structures.

Confinement of particles into bound states is a phenomenon spanning from high-energy to condensed matter physics, which can be studied in the framework of lattice gauge theories (LGTs). Achieving a comprehensive understanding of confinement continues to pose a major challenge, in particular at finite matter density and in the presence of strong quantum fluctuations. State-of-the-art quantum simulators constitute a promising platform to address this problem. Here we study confinement in coupled chains of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGTs coupled to matter fields, that can be mapped to a mixed-dimensional (mixD) XXZ model. We perform large-scale numerical matrix-product state calculations to obtain the phase diagram of this model, in which we uncover striped phases formed by the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ charges that can be melted at finite temperature or by increasing the tunneling rate. To explore this setting experimentally, we use our quantum simulator constituted by erbium atoms with dipolar interactions in a quantum gas microscope, and observe the predicted melting of a stripe phase by increasing the particle tunneling rate. Our explorative experimental studies of thermal deconfinement of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ charges motivate our further theoretical study of the mixD $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT, in which we predict a confined meson gas at finite temperature and low magnetization where thermal fluctuations destroy stripes but enable spontaneous commensurate spin order. Overall, we demonstrate that our platform can be used to study confinement in $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGTs coupled to matter fields, including long-range interactions and beyond one dimension, paving the way for future research of confinement in the quantum many-body regime.

Title:
Efficient lattice QCD computation of radiative-leptonic-decay form factors at multiple positive and negative photon virtualities

In previous work Phys. Rev. D 107, 074507 (2023), we showed that form factors for radiative leptonic decays of pseudoscalar mesons can be determined efficiently and with high precision from lattice QCD using the ``3d method,'' in which three-point functions are computed for all values of the current-insertion time and the time integral is performed at the data-analysis stage. Here, we demonstrate another benefit of the 3d method: the form factors can be extracted for any number of nonzero photon virtualites from the same three-point functions at no extra cost. We present results for the $D_s\to\ell\nu\gamma^*$ vector form factor as a function of photon energy and photon virtuality, for both positive and negative virtuality. In our analysis, we separately consider the two different time orderings and the different quark flavors in the electromagnetic current. We discuss in detail the behavior of the unwanted exponentials contributing to the three-point functions, as well as the choice of fit models and fit ranges used to remove them for various values of the virtuality. While positive photon virtuality is relevant for decays to multiple charged leptons, negative photon virtuality suppresses soft contributions and is of interest in QCD-factorization studies of the form factors.

Title:
Entanglement Structure of Non-Gaussian States and How to Measure It

Rapidly growing capabilities of quantum simulators to probe quantum many-body phenomena require new methods to characterize increasingly complex states. We present a protocol that constrains quantum states by experimentally measured correlation functions which only scales polynomially with system size. This method enables measurement of a quantum state's entanglement structure, opening a new route to study entanglement-related phenomena. Our approach extends Gaussian state parameterizations by systematically incorporating higher-order correlations. We show the protocol's usefulness in conjunction with current and forthcoming experimental capabilities, focusing on weakly interacting fermions as a proof of concept. Here, the lowest non-trivial expansion quantitatively predicts early time thermalization dynamics, including signaling the on-set of quantum chaos indicated by the entanglement Hamiltonian.

Hyper Stealth Dark Matter and Long-Lived Particles

A new dark matter candidate is proposed that arises as the lightest baryon from a confining $SU(N)$ gauge theory which equilibrates with the Standard Model only through electroweak interactions. Surprisingly, this candidate can be as light as a few GeV. The lower bound arises from the intersection of two competing requirements: i) the equilibration sector of the model must be sufficiently heavy, at least several TeV, to avoid bounds from colliders, and ii) the lightest dark meson (that may be the dark $\eta'$, $\sigma$, or the lightest glueball) has suppressed interactions with the SM, and must decay before BBN. The low energy dark sector consists of one flavor that is electrically neutral and an almost electroweak singlet. The dark matter candidate is the lightest baryon consisting of $N$ of these light flavors leading to a highly suppressed elastic scattering rate with the SM. The equilibration sector consists of vector-like dark quarks that transform under the electroweak group, ensuring that the dark sector can reach thermal equilibrium with the SM in the early Universe. The lightest dark meson lifetimes vary between $10^{-3} \lesssim c \tau \lesssim 10^7$~meters, providing an outstanding target for LHC production and experimental detection. We delineate the interplay between the lifetime of the light mesons, the suppressed direct detection cross section of the lightest baryon, and the scale of equilibration sector that can be probed at the LHC.

Title:
High-precision bootstrap of multi-matrix quantum mechanics

We consider matrix quantum mechanics with multiple bosonic matrices, including those obtained from dimensional reduction of Yang-Mills theories. Using the matrix bootstrap, we study simple observables like $\langle \mathop{tr} X^2 \rangle$ in the confining phase of the theory in the infinite $N$ limit. By leveraging the symmetries of these models and using non-linear relaxation, we consider constraints up to level 14, e.g., constraints from traces of words of length $\le 14$. Our results are more precise than large $N$, continuum extrapolations of lattice Monte Carlo simulations, including an estimate of certain simple observables up to 8 significant digits.
