Title:
Design and deployment of a fast neural network for measuring the properties of muons originating from displaced vertices in the CMS Endcap Muon Track Finder
Efe Yigitbasi (on behalf of CMS Collaboration)
Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)
We report on the development, implementation, and performance of a fast neural network used to measure the transverse momentum in the CMS Level-1 Endcap Muon Track Finder. The network aims to improve the triggering efficiency of muons produced in the decays of long-lived particles (LLPs). We implemented it in firmware for a Xilinx Virtex-7 FPGA and deployed it during the LHC Run 3 data-taking in 2023. The new displaced muon triggers that use this algorithm broaden the phase space accessible to the CMS experiment for searches that look for evidence of LLPs that decay into muons.

We report results of optical characterizations of new wavelength-shifting and scintillating-wavelength-shifting fibers EJ-182 and EJ-160 from Eljen Technology and compare them to the wavelength-shifting fiber BCF-91A from Saint-Gobain. The wavelength-dependence of attenuation was derived from spectral measurements confirming that the long attenuation length increases with wavelength, while short attenuation effects become less significant at longer wavelengths. The impact of environmental refractive index was measured by immersing a fiber in water. Immersing the fibers in water reduced the light yield and led to a suppression of the short attenuation length, consistent with the expected decrease in the refractive index contrast.

We investigate the origin of the unusually large electroweak (EW) radiative effects observed in the extraction of the spin-density matrix and related observables at colliders, focusing on leptonic Z-boson decays. We compute the Z-boson-decay spin-density matrix at next-to-leading order (NLO) and find that, while its analytic structure remains essentially unchanged with respect to leading order, the EW corrections induce a sizeable $-35\%$ shift in the spin-analysing-power parameter $\eta_\ell$. This effect alone accounts for the striking size of the corrections. For boosted Z bosons, we further show that the treatment of photon radiation in lepton-dressing algorithms significantly affects the extraction of spin-density-matrix coefficients at NLO and must be carefully controlled. To address these challenges, we propose a quantum tomography procedure that is applicable to any final state with one or more on-shell Z bosons that is robust under higher-order corrections. We illustrate its validity and limitations in ${\textrm{pp}} \to {\textrm{ZZ}} \to 4\ell$ and in heavy ($M_{\textrm{H}}>2 M_{\textrm{Z}}$) Higgs-boson decay ${\textrm{H}}\to {\textrm{ZZ}} \to 4\ell$.

Title:
Collider probes of baryogenesis with maximal CP asymmetry

We propose a novel collider probe of baryogenesis at TeV scale by measuring decay asymmetries into particle and anti-particle final states. Motivated by the idea of Dirac leptogenesis, we consider an extension of the standard model with new colored and $SU(2)_L$ singlet particles in such a way that the out-of-equilibrium decay of heavy colored fermions creates equal and opposite CP asymmetries in two sectors, prevented from equilibrating with each other. While the TeV scale viability of this mechanism requires a resonantly enhanced CP asymmetry, the latter also plays a crucial role leading to observable decay asymmetries in colliders. In addition to discussing conventional signatures of such heavy colored particles, namely, mono-jet plus missing transverse energy, displaced vertex, colored track at hadron colliders, we also show the unique possibility of measuring decay asymmetries via forward-backward and charge asymmetries at future muon colliders. In addition to being a verifiable TeV-scale baryogenesis scenario, the model also predicts a singlet scalar dark matter candidate consistent with the required thermal dark matter properties near the Higgs resonance.

Axion-like particles (ALPs), hypothetical pseudoscalar particles that couple to photons, are among the most actively investigated candidates for new physics beyond the Standard Model. Their interaction with gamma rays in the presence of astrophysical magnetic fields can leave characteristic, energy-dependent modulations in observed spectra. Capturing such subtle features requires precise statistical inference, but standard likelihood-based methods often fall short when faced with complex models, large number of nuisance parameters and limited analytical tractability. In this work, we investigate the application of simulation-based inference (SBI), specifically Truncated Marginal Neural Ratio Estimation (TMNRE), to constrain ALP parameters using simulated observations from the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO). We model the gamma-ray emission from the active galactic nucleus NGC 1275, accounting for photon-ALP mixing, extragalactic background light (EBL) absorption, and the full CTAO instrument response. Leveraging the Swyft framework, we infer posteriors for the ALP mass and coupling strength and demonstrate its potential to extract meaningful constraints on ALPs from future real gamma-ray data with CTAO.

Spectrum of Light Hexaquark States in Triquark-antitriquark Configuration

Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)
To understand the nature of $X(2075)$ and $X(2085)$ observed by the BESIII collaboration in the $p\bar{\Lambda}$ system, we systematically investigate the possibility that these states are compact hexaquark with triquark-antitriquark configurations for the first time. Within the framework of QCD sum rules, the mass spectrum and decay constants of such hexaquark states with quantum numbers $J^P=0^-, 0^+, 1^-, 1^+$ are studied. Consequently, six independent and nondegenerate hexaquark candidates are obtained, among which two $J^P = 1^-$ states exhibit masses consistent with $X(2075)$, while the two $J^P = 1^+$ states differ markedly from the mass of $X(2075)$ or $X(2085)$. The remaining two states with $J^P = 0^+$ and $0^-$ may serve as predictions for potential compact hexaquark configurations. Furthermore, the possible decay modes of these hexaquark states are analyzed, which could be the experimental signatures for their identification.

Future high-luminosity hadron colliders demand tracking detectors with extreme radiation tolerance, high spatial precision, and sub-nanosecond timing. 3D diamond pixel sensors offer these capabilities due to diamond's radiation hardness and high carrier mobility. Conductive electrodes, produced via femtosecond IR laser pulses, exhibit high resistivity that delays signal propagation. This effect necessitates extending the classical Ramo-Shockley weighting potential formalism. We model the phenomenon through a 3rd-order, 3+1D PDE derived as a quasi-stationary approximation of Maxwell's equations. The PDE is solved numerically and coupled with charge transport simulations for realistic 3D sensor geometries. A Mixture-of-Experts Physics-Informed Neural Network, trained on Spectral Method data, provides a meshless solver to assess timing degradation from electrode resistance.

First results from LEGEND-200 on the search for neutrinoless double beta decay
Giovanna Saleh (on behalf of the LEGEND Collaboration)

Subjects:
Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex); High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)
Neutrinoless double beta decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$) is a rare process which could take place if neutrinos are Majorana fermions: the observation of this decay would provide unambiguous evidence for the existence of new Physics beyond the Standard Model, as it entails a two-units lepton number violation. The LEGEND experiment (Large Enriched Germanium Experiment for Neutrinoless $\beta\beta$ Decay) searches for the $0\nu\beta\beta$ of $^{76}$Ge using High Purity Germanium detectors enriched in $^{76}$Ge beyond the 86%. The LEGEND project foresees two phases, LEGEND-200, aiming at a final 3$\sigma$ discovery sensitivity beyond 10$^{27}$ yr, and LEGEND-1000, aiming at a final sensitivity beyond 10$^{28}$ yr. LEGEND-200 started taking data in 2023 at Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (LNGS): in about one year it collected a total physics exposure of 61 kg yr, with a background index of $0.5^{+0.3}_{-0.2} \cdot 10^{-3}$ counts/(keV kg yr) in the so-called "golden dataset" and of $1.3^{+0.8}_{-0.5} \cdot 10^{-3}$ counts/(keV kg yr) in the so-called "silver dataset". The performed statistical analysis finds no evidence for a $0\nu\beta\beta$ signal and sets a lower limit on its half life to $T_{1/2}^{0\nu} > 0.5 \cdot 10^{26}$ yr at 90% CL. A combined analysis of the three germanium-based $0\nu\beta\beta$ experiments GERDA, MAJORANA Demonstrator and LEGEND-200 provides a lower limit of $T_{1/2}^{0\nu} > 1.9 \cdot 10^{26}$ yr at 90% CL.

The Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND) is a proposed multi-messenger observatory of ultra-high-energy (UHE) particles of cosmic origin. Its main goal is to find the long-sought origin of UHE cosmic rays by detecting large numbers of them and the secondary particles created by their interaction -- gamma rays, and, especially, neutrinos. GRAND will do so using large arrays of radio antennas that look for the radio signals emitted by the air showers initiated by the interactions of the UHE particles in the atmosphere. Since 2023, three small-scale prototype GRAND arrays have been in operation: GRAND@Nançay in France, GRAND@Auger in Argentina, and GRANDProto300 in China. Together, their goal is to validate the detection principle of GRAND under prolonged field conditions, achieving efficient, autonomous radio-detection of air showers. We describe the hardware, software, layout, and operation of the GRAND prototypes and show the first radio spectra measured by them. Despite challenges, the successful operation of the prototypes confirms that the GRAND instrumentation is apt to address the goals of the experiment and lays the groundwork for its ensuing stages.

This paper presents the first measurement of $\psi{(2S)}$ and $\chi_{c1}(3872)$ meson production within fully reconstructed jets. Each quarkonium state (tag) is reconstructed via its decay to the $J/\psi$($\rightarrow\mu^+\mu^-$)$\pi^+\pi^-$ final state in the forward region using proton-proton collision data collected by the LHCb experiment at the center-of-mass-energy of $13 \text{TeV}$ in 2016, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $1.64 \text{fb}^{-1}$. The fragmentation function, presented as the ratio of the quarkonium-tag transverse momentum to the full jet transverse momentum ($p_{\mathrm{T}}(\text{tag})/p_{\mathrm{T}}(\text{jet})$), is measured differentially in $p_{\mathrm{T}}(\text{jet})$ and $p_{\mathrm{T}}(\text{tag})$ bins. The distributions are separated into promptly produced quarkonia from proton-proton collisions and quarkonia produced from displaced $b$-hadron decays. While the displaced quarkonia fragmentation functions are in general well described by parton-shower predictions, the prompt quarkonium distributions differ significantly from fixed-order non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD) predictions followed by a QCD parton shower.

Ultralight axion-like particles are well-motivated relics that might compose the cosmological dark matter and source anomalous time-dependent magnetic fields. We report on terrestrial bounds from the Noble And Alkali Spin Detectors for Ultralight Coherent darK matter (NASDUCK) collaboration on the coupling of axion-like particles to neutrons and protons. The detector uses nuclei of noble-gas and alkali-metal atoms and operates in the Spin-Exchange Relaxation-Free~(SERF) regime, achieving high sensitivity to axion-like dark matter fields. Conducting a month-long search, we cover the mass range of $1.4\times 10^{-12}$~eV/$c^2$ to $2\times 10^{-10}$~eV/$c^2$ and provide limits which supersede robust astrophysical bounds, and improve upon previous terrestrial constraints by over two orders of magnitude for many masses within this range for protons, and up to two orders of magnitude for neutrons. These are the first reliable terrestrial bounds reported on the coupling of protons with axion-like dark matter, covering an unexplored terrain in its parameter space.

Revisiting Reactor Anti-Neutrino 5 MeV Bump with $^{13}$C Neutral-Current Interaction

For the first time, we comprehensively examine the potential of a neutral-current interaction of reactor neutrino with $^{13}$C emitting a 3.685 MeV photon to identify the origin of the 5 MeV bump in reactor antineutrino spectra observed through the inverse beta decay (IBD) process. This anomaly may be due to new physics, reactor antineutrino flux inaccuracies, or IBD systematics. The 3.685 MeV photon released during the de-excitation of $^{13}$C$^\ast$ to its ground state is observable in liquid scintillator detectors. Remarkably, we confirm the powerfulness of our proposal by completely ruling out a new physics scenario explaining the bump from the existing NEOS data. We also explore the potential of current and forthcoming experiments, including solar neutrino studies at JUNO, pion and muon decay-at-rest experiments at OscSNS, and isotope decay-at-rest studies at Yemilab, to measure the cross-section precisely enough to distinguish the expected bump and the theoretical flux models via our channel. Additionally, we propose a novel method to track the time evolution of reactor isotopes by analyzing the $^{13}$C signal, which yields critical insights into the contributions of $^{235}$U and $^{239}$Pu to the bump, acting as a robust tool.

Machine learning tagged boosted dark photon: A signature of fermionic portal matter at the LHC

We use a Hybrid Deep Neural Network (HDNN) to identify a boosted dark photon jet as a signature of a heavy vector-like fermionic portal matter (PM) connecting the visible and the dark sectors. In this work, the fermionic PM, which mixes only with the Standard Model (SM) third-generation up-type quark, predominantly decays into a top quark and a dark photon pair. The dark photon then $promptly$ decays to a pair of standard model fermions via the gauge kinetic mixing. We have analyzed two different final states, namely, (i) exactly one tagged dark photon and exactly one tagged top quark jet, and (ii) at least two tagged dark photons and at least one tagged top quark jet at the 13 and 14 TeV LHC center of mass energies. Both these final states receive significant contributions from the pair and single production processes of the top partner. The rich event topology of the signal processes, $i.e.$, the presence of a boosted dark photon and top quark jet pair, along with the fact that the invariant mass of the system corresponds to the mass of the top partner, help us to significantly suppress potential SM backgrounds. We have shown that one can set a $2\sigma$ exclusion limit of $\sim 2.3$ TeV on the top partner mass with $\sin\theta_L=0.1$ and assuming $100\%$ branching ratio of the top partner in the final state with exactly one tagged dark photon and exactly one tagged top quark jet at the 14 TeV LHC center of mass energy assuming 300 fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity.

We introduce a novel end-to-end framework for jet reconstruction in high-energy collider events, leveraging the efficiency and long-range modeling capabilities of the Mamba architecture. Our model unifies instance segmentation, classification, and kinematic regression into a single multi-task learning system, enabling a sophisticated multi-level reconstruction that simultaneously identifies primary heavy jets ($t$, $H$, $W/Z$) and their constituent sub-jets. To facilitate supervised learning for this complex task, we develop a novel method for assigning final-state hadrons to their ancestor colored partons using a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming solver, which generates high-fidelity ground-truth labels. The model achieves high classification accuracy, with an Average Precision score of 0.569 for $W/Z$-jets and 0.568 for $b$-jets, and shows exceptional precision in kinematic reconstruction. Furthermore, we show that the model not only maintains stable performance in high-pileup environments but also successfully reconstructs the mass peaks of beyond the standard model particles. This work presents a powerful and versatile new tool for comprehensive event reconstruction at the LHC.

In high-energy and astroparticle physics, event generators play an essential role, even in the simplest data analyses. As analysis techniques become more sophisticated, e.g. based on deep neural networks, their correct description of the observed event characteristics becomes even more important. Physical processes occurring in hadronic collisions are simulated within a Monte Carlo framework. A major challenge is the modeling of hadron dynamics at low momentum transfer, which includes the initial and final phases of every hadronic collision. QCD-inspired phenomenological models used for these phases cannot guarantee completeness or correctness over the full phase space. These models usually include parameters which must be tuned to suitable experimental data. Until now, event generators have been developed and tuned mainly on the basis of data from high-energy physics experiments at accelerators. The wealth of data available from the latest generation of astroparticle experiments has not yet been fully exploited, and in many cases is not satisfactorily described. Both kinds of data sets are complementary as astroparticle experiments provide sensitivity especially to hadrons produced nearly parallel to the collision axis and cover center-of-mass energies up to several hundred TeV, well beyond those reached at colliders so far. In this report, we provide an overview of state-of-the-art event generators and their tuning, including the most relevant inputs from high-energy accelerator and astroparticle experiments. We present a road map that shows, for the first time, how the unified tuning of event generators with accelerator-based and astroparticle data can be performed.

Multiple dispersive bounds. I) An improved z-expansion

17 pages, 1 figure, 1 table; references added

We propose the implementation of two novel ingredients in the standard $z$-expansion of hadronic form factors, commonly referred to as the Boyd-Grinstein-Lebed (BGL) approach [1-4]. The first new ingredient is the explicit addition of a unitarity filter applied to a given known set of input data for the hadronic form factors. This further constraint is not usually taken into account in the phenomenological applications of the BGL $z$-expansion. We show that it brings to a formulation of the BGL approach fully equivalent to the Dispersion Matrix (DM) method [5], which describes hadronic form factors in a completely model-independent and non-perturbative way. The second key ingredient is represented by the introduction of suitable kernel functions in the evaluation of unitarity bounds, leading to the application of multiple dispersive bounds to hadronic form factors, whenever data and/or (non-)perturbative techniques allow to do so. This idea may be useful for the investigation of many physical processes, from the analysis of the electromagnetic form factors of mesons and baryons to the study of weak semileptonic decays of hadrons. An explicit numerical application will be presented in the companion paper [6], where the effects of sub-threshold branch-cuts are analyzed.

We apply the general framework of multiple dispersive bounds, firstly discussed in the companion paper [1], to the study of sub-threshold branch-cuts. We propose the simultaneous application of a double dispersive bound as a proper way to take into account unitarity constraints within phenomenological analyses of hadronic form factors in the presence of sub-threshold branch-cuts. Accordingly, the standard $z$-expansion of hadronic form factors, commonly referred to as the Boyd-Grinstein-Lebed approach [2-5], is modified by including simultaneously the dispersive bounds related to the pair-production and to the sub-threshold regions. For the latter one the effects of above-threshold poles are described through a new resonance model and the possible choices of the outer function outside the pair-production region are discussed. A detailed numerical analysis of the experimental data or lattice QCD results in the spacelike region for the charged kaon form factor is presented as a direct application of the procedure of double dispersive bound. The comparison with other methodologies present in literature and with the $z$-expansion based on the single, total dispersive bound clearly shows that the $z$-expansion including the double dispersive bound provides the most precise extrapolation at large momentum transfer as well as the most stable results with respect to the choice of the outer function outside the pair-production region.
