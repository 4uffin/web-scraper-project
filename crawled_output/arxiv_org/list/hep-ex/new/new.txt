Based on $(448.1\pm2.9)\times10^{6}$ $\psi(3686)$ events collected with the BESIII detector at the BEPCII collider, we present the first observation of spin transverse polarization of $\Lambda$ and $\bar\Lambda$ hyperons produced coherently in the decay $\psi(3686)\to\Lambda(\to p\pi^-)\bar\Lambda(\to\bar p\pi^+)$. The relative phase between the electric and magnetic hadronic form factors is measured to be $\Delta\Phi=(21.0\pm3.7_{\rm stat.}\pm0.8_{\rm syst.})^{\circ}$. The angular distribution parameter $\alpha_{\psi}=0.83\pm0.02_{\rm stat.}\pm0.01_{\rm syst.}$ is determined with a precision improved by a factor of 3.7 compared to the previous measurement. The relative phase between the $S$- and $D$-wave amplitudes for $\Lambda\bar\Lambda$ is observed, and the effective interaction radius is determined to be $0.0450\pm0.0026_{\rm stat.}\pm0.0012_{\rm syst.}$ fm. These results provide new insights into the strong interaction mechanisms and the internal structure of baryons.

High-energy collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have traditionally focused on particle production at small pseudorapidities. However, to further utilize the valuable data from particles produced at the ATLAS interaction point along the beamline, the proposed Forward Physics Facility (FPF) aims to study particle production in the far-forward region at the high-luminosity LHC. The FPF will house a suite of experiments with the ability of enhancing hadronic interaction models by measurement of the resulting neutrino fluxes. These advancements are critical for astroparticle physics, linking forward scattering processes to extensive air showers and improving our understanding of cosmic-ray interactions. This work investigates simulated neutrino fluxes in the far-forward region from proton-proton collisions at ATLAS, analyzing final state particles propagated to this new facility. Results from this simulation provide theoretical expectations for the neutrino fluxes at the FPF, offering insights to refine hadronic interaction models, including the most recently developed, and better estimate atmospheric neutrino backgrounds in astrophysical neutrino telescopes.

Searches are presented for $B_{c}^{+} \to D h^+ h^-$ decays, where $D$ is a charmed meson and $h^{\pm}$ is a charged pion or kaon, using $pp$ collision data collected by the LHCb experiment corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $9~\text{fb}^{-1}$. The decays $B_c^+\to D^+ K^+\pi^-$, $B_c^+\to D^{*+} K^+\pi^-$ and $B_c^+\to D_s^+ K^+ K^-$ are observed for the first time. Their branching fractions, expressed as ratios relative to that of the $B_c^+\to B_s^0\pi^+$ decay, are determined to be \begin{align*} \mathcal{R}(B_c^+\to D^+ K^+\pi^-) =(1.96 \pm 0.23\pm 0.08 \pm 0.10)\times 10^{-3},&\\ \mathcal{R}(B_c^+\to D^{*+} K^+\pi^-) =(3.67 \pm 0.55 \pm 0.24\pm 0.20)\times 10^{-3},&\\ \mathcal{R}(B_c^+\to D_s^+ K^+ K^-) =(1.61 \pm 0.35\pm 0.13\pm 0.07)\times 10^{-3}, \end{align*} where the first uncertainty is statistical, the second is systematic, and the third is due to the limited precision on the $D$-meson branching fractions. The decay channels proceed primarily through excited $K^0$ or $D^0$ resonances or $\phi$ mesons, and open a new avenue for studies of charge-parity violation in beauty mesons.

The top-quark Yukawa coupling is extracted from the distribution of the top-quark pair ($t\overline{t}$) invariant mass in proton-proton collisions using 140 fb$^{-1}$ of data at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV collected in 2015-2018 by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. In the region near the production threshold, the $t\overline{t}$ invariant mass spectrum is sensitive to electroweak virtual corrections, including contributions from Higgs boson exchange, thereby providing sensitivity to the top-quark Yukawa coupling. This is the first measurement in ATLAS that aims to obtain this coupling exploiting this approach. The $t\overline{t}$ system is reconstructed in the single-lepton final state, requiring exactly one isolated electron or muon and at least four jets with at least two identified as originating from $b$-quarks. The measured Yukawa coupling is found to be in good agreement with the Standard Model prediction. An upper limit on the top-quark Yukawa coupling strength of $Y_t < 2.1$ relative to the Standard Model prediction is observed at 95% confidence level, consistent with the expected sensitivity.

In the BESIII detector at Beijing electron positron collider, billions of events from $e^+e^-$ collisions were recorded. These events passing through the trigger system were saved in raw data format files. They play an important role in the study of physics in tau-charm energy region. Here, we published an $e^+e^-$ collision dataset containing both Monte Carlo simulation samples and real data collected by the BESIII detector. The data pass through the detector trigger system, file format conversion, and physics information extraction and finally save the physics information and detector response in text format files. This dataset is publicly available and is intended to provide interested scientists and those outside of the BESIII collaboration with event information from BESIII, which can be used to understand physics research in $e^+e^-$-collisions, developing visualization projects for physics education, public outreach, and science advocacy.

A study of the difference in the $CP$ asymmetries between ${\Lambda}^0_b \rightarrow J / \psi p \pi^-$ and ${\Lambda}^0_b \rightarrow J / \psi p K^-$ decays, $\Delta {\cal A}_{CP}$, is performed using proton-proton collision data collected by the LHCb experiment in the years 2015--2018, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $6 {\rm fb}^{-1}$. This quantity is measured to be $ \Delta {\cal A}_{CP}=(4.03\pm 1.18\pm 0.23)\%$, where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second is systematic. When combined with the previous LHCb result, a value of $\Delta {\cal A}_{CP} = (4.31 \pm 1.06 \pm 0.28)\%$ is obtained, corresponding to a significance of $3.9\sigma$ against the $CP$ symmetry hypothesis. Studies of triple-product asymmetries, which provide an additional probe of $CP$ violation, show no significant deviation from $CP$ symmetry.

The dark matter scattering with atomic bound electrons is a crucial avenue for exploring the sub-GeV mass range. If not handled properly, even negative values can arise in the scattering matrix element squared or equivalently the differential cross section in extreme cases. Starting from quantum field theory, we establish a theoretically consistent formalism to account for the atomic effects. Especially, we investigate the difference between the non-relativistic and relativistic calculations to show that the relativistic effects can lead to a $30\% \sim 50\%$ reduction in the atomic factor. In other words, not just a theoretically consistent formalism for the atomic effects but also relativistic calculation with Dirac equation are necessary.

Recent experimental results have reported mild deviations from Standard Model predictions in processes involving two photons in the final state, suggesting the possible presence of high-mass scalar resonances at the few-hundred-GeV scale. We investigate these anomalies within the framework of 3-3-1 models, a well-motivated class of extensions of the Standard Model. Focusing on the most relevant regions of parameter space, we determine the preferred scalar mass ranges and present the results in terms of probability density functions. We implement the 3-3-1 model with right-handed neutrinos, which can be considered as a benchmark within this class of models, in the SARAH package. The scalar sector is constructed from the most general potential involving three Higgs triplets and one scalar sextet, consistent with the required symmetries for a realistic model. The neutrino sector is also analyzed in some detail, where left- and right-handed neutrinos reside in the same leptonic multiplet. Neutrino masses are generated via the Type-I seesaw mechanism, and the Yukawa couplings were constrained employing the Casas-Ibarra parametrization. Finally, we discuss the constraints arising from flavor-changing neutral currents and electroweak precision data.

Title:
Efficient Estimation of Unfactorizable Systematic Uncertainties
Alexis Romero, Kyle Cranmer, Daniel Whiteson
Subjects:
Methodology (stat.ME); High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)
Accurate assessment of systematic uncertainties is an increasingly vital task in physics studies, where large, high-dimensional datasets, like those collected at the Large Hadron Collider, hold the key to new discoveries. Common approaches to assessing systematic uncertainties rely on simplifications, such as assuming that the impact of the various sources of uncertainty factorizes. In this paper, we provide realistic example scenarios in which this assumption fails. We introduce an algorithm that uses Gaussian process regression to estimate the impact of systematic uncertainties \textit{without} assuming factorization. The Gaussian process models are enhanced with derivative information, which increases the accuracy of the regression without increasing the number of samples. In addition, we present a novel sampling strategy based on Bayesian experimental design, which is shown to be more efficient than random and grid sampling in our example scenarios.

Mass and full decay width of the hadronic tensor molecule $\mathcal{M}_{ \mathrm{T}}=B_c^{\ast +}B_c^{\ast -}$ are examined in the framework of QCD sum rule method. To find the mass $m$ and current coupling $\Lambda$ of this state, we use the two-point sum rules. The result $(12.87 \pm 0.08)~\mathrm{ GeV}$ for $m$ indicates that $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{T}}$ can easily decay to pairs of $J/\psi \Upsilon $, $\eta_{b}\eta _{c}$, $B_{c}^{+}B_{c}^{-}$, and $ B_{c}^{\ast +}B_{c}^{\ast -}$ mesons. Kinematically permitted ways for $ \mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{T}}$ to transform to conventional mesons include also processes $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{T}} \to D^{(\ast)+}D^{(\ast )-}$, $D^{(\ast )0}\overline{D}^{(\ast )0}$, and $D_{s}^{(\ast)+}D_{s}^{(\ast)-}$ triggered by annihilation of $b\overline{b}$ quarks in the molecule. The decays to meson pairs $B^{(\ast)+}B^{(\ast )-}$, $B^{(\ast )0}\overline{B}^{(\ast )0}$ , and $B_{s}^{(\ast)0}\overline{B}_{s}^{(\ast )0}$ generated by $c\overline{c } \to $ light quarks are also among possible channels of the hadronic molecule $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{T}}$. Technical tools of the three-point sum rule approach are applied to compute partial widths of these decays. Our results for the mass and width $\Gamma_{\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{T}}}=(154 \pm 19)~ \mathrm{MeV} $ of the tensor molecule $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{T}}$ are important for experimental studies of fully heavy exotic structures.

Accessing nucleon transversity with one-point energy correlators

We propose a novel probe of the nucleon's transversity distribution, $h_1^q$, using the one-point energy correlator (OPEC), an infrared-and-collinear safe jet substructure observable. We demonstrate that in transversely polarized $p^{\uparrow}p$ collisions, the OPEC exhibits a single-spin asymmetry (SSA) with a clean $\sin(\phi_s - \phi_n)$ angular dependence. This method probes SSA over a much wider kinematic range in the angular scale $\theta_n$ compared to traditional measurements of hadron transverse momentum~$j_\perp$, establishing a complementary and systematically distinct channel to study the nucleon's three-dimensional structure at RHIC and the future Electron-Ion Collider.

We report the first detection of gamma-ray emission from the Galactic center in the 150-600 keV band using a linear, imaging-spectroscopy approach used in common telescopes with an electron-tracking Compton camera (ETCC) aboard the SMILE-2+ balloon experiment. A one-day flight over Australia resulted in a significant gamma-ray detection in the light curve and revealed a $7.9\sigma$ excess in the image map from the Galactic center region. These results, obtained through a simple and unambiguous analysis, demonstrate the high reliability and sensitivity of the ETCC and establish its potential for future high-precision MeV gamma-ray observations. The measured intensity and spatial distribution were tested against three emission models: a single point-like source, a multi-component structure, and a symmetric two-dimensional Gaussian. All models were found to be statistically consistent with the data. The positronium-related flux in the multi-component model is $(3.2~\pm~1.4)~\times~10^{-2}$ photons cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$, which is approximately a factor of two higher than the value reported by INTEGRAL, with a discrepancy at the $2\sigma$ level. This difference may arise from unresolved sources or truly diffuse emission, such as exotic processes involving light dark matter or primordial black holes.

Parton distributions encode the momentum-space structure and, in their generalizations, the spatial tomography of quarks and gluons inside hadrons, the building blocks of visible matter. We present a unified neural-network approach that learns these distributions directly from matrix elements calculated via numerical simulations of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) on the lattice by fitting two complementary inputs simultaneously: data matched to physical quantities via known momentum-space and coordinate-space formalisms. Utilizing data from both methods stabilizes the extraction and mitigates biases that can arise when either is used alone. We validate the method on controlled mock data and apply it to lattice-QCD matrix elements to extract parton distribution functions (PDFs). We show benefits of such an approach for determining the physical quantities. We further extend the framework to zero-skewness generalized parton distributions and demonstrate nucleon tomography within the same neural-network parameterization. Our results provide an adaptable and systematically improvable approach for extracting partonic distributions from Euclidean correlators. It can incorporate polarization, additional channels, and future experimental constraints from current and future facilities, such as the Electron-Ion Collider.

A first determination of the strong-phase difference between $D^0$ and $\bar{D^0}\to K^+K^-\pi^+\pi^-$ is performed using $e^+e^-\to\psi(3770)\to D\bar{D}$ data collected by the BESIII detector corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $20.3$ fb$^{-1}$. The measurements are made in four pairs of bins in phase space, which are chosen to provide optimal sensitivity to the angle $\gamma$ of the Unitarity Triangle in $B^\pm \to DK^\pm$ decays. From these measurements, it follows that the $C\!P$-even fraction of the decay is $F_+ = 0.754 \pm 0.010_{\rm \, stat.} \pm 0.008_{\rm \, syst.}$. In addition, the branching fraction of $D^0 \to K^+K^-\pi^+\pi^-$ is measured to be $(2.863 \pm 0.028_{\rm \, stat.} \pm 0.045_{\rm \, syst.})\times10^{-3}$, which is twice as precise as previous results obtained at other experiments.

We report the first observation of the two-body baryonic decays $B^{+} \to \Sigma_{c}(2455)^{++} \overline{\Xi}_{c}^{-}$ and $B^{0} \to \Sigma_{c}(2455)^{0} \overline{\Xi}_{c}^{0}$ with significances of $7.3\,\sigma$ and $6.2\,\sigma$, respectively, including statistical and systematic uncertainties. The branching fractions are measured to be $\mathcal{B}(B^{+} \to \Sigma_{c}(2455)^{++} \overline{\Xi}_{c}^{-}) = (5.74 \pm 1.11 \pm 0.42_{-1.53}^{+2.47}) \times 10^{-4}$ and $\mathcal{B}(B^{0} \to \Sigma_{c}(2455)^{0} \overline{\Xi}_{c}^{0}) = (4.83 \pm 1.12 \pm 0.37_{-0.60}^{+0.72}) \times 10^{-4}$. The first and second uncertainties are statistical and systematic, respectively, while the third ones arise from the absolute branching fractions of $\overline{\Xi}_{c}^{-}$ or $\overline{\Xi}_{c}^{0}$ decays. The data samples used for this analysis have integrated luminosities of 711~$\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ and 365~$\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$, and were collected at the $\Upsilon(4S)$ resonance by the Belle and Belle~II detectors operating at the KEKB and SuperKEKB asymmetric-energy $e^{+}e^{-}$ colliders, respectively.

In semiconductor detectors designed for capturing dark matter particles or neutrinos, when the detection threshold is constantly improved to increasingly low energies, an "excess" signal of apparent energy release events below a few hundred eV is observed in several different kinds of detectors. This becomes a big obstacle to the observation of actual dark matter signals, hindering the detectors' sensitivity for rare events in this energy range. Using atomistic simulations with a classical thermostat and a quantum thermal bath, we show that this kind of signal is consistent with energy release from long-term annealing events of complex defects that can be formed by any kind of nuclear recoil radiation events. Such energy releases are shown to have a very similar exponential dependence on energy release magnitudes as that observed in experiments. By detailed analysis of the annealing events, we show that crossing very low energy barriers can trigger larger energy releases in an avalanche-like effect. This explains why large energy release events can occur even down to cryogenic temperatures, where the significant migration of point defects in silicon is hardly ever possible.

The presence of a dark matter component in the Universe, together with the discovery of neutrino masses from the observation of the oscillation phenomenon, represents one of the most important open questions in particle physics today. A concurrent solution arises when one of the right-handed neutrinos, necessary for the generation of light neutrino masses, is itself the dark matter candidate. In this article, we study the generation of such a dark matter candidate relying solely on the presence of neutrino mixing. This tightly links the generation of dark matter with searches in laboratory experiments on top of the usual indirect dark matter probes. We find that the regions of parameter space producing the observed dark matter abundance can be probed indirectly with electroweak precision observables and charged lepton flavor violation searches. Given that the heavy neutrino masses need to lie at most around the TeV scale, probes at future colliders would further test this production mechanism.

A critical element in the realization of large liquid and gas time projection chambers (TPCs) is the delivery and distribution of high voltages into and around the detector. Such experiments require of order tens of kilovolts to enable electron drift over meter-scale distances. This paper describes the design and operation of the cathode feedthrough and high voltage distribution through the field cage of the NEXT-100 experiment, an underground TPC that will search for neutrinoless double beta decay $0\nu\beta\beta$. The feedthrough has been demonstrated to hold pressures up to 20~bar and sustain voltages as high as -65~kV, and the TPC is operating stably at its design high voltages. The system has been realized within the constraints of a stringent radiopurity budget and is now being used to execute a suite of sensitive double beta decay analyses.

Predicting the outcomes of quantum measurements is a cornerstone of quantum information theory and a key resource for quantum technologies. Here, we introduce a comprehensive framework for quantifying the predictability of measurements on a bipartite quantum system using error measures inherited from statistical learning theory: the Bayes risk and inference variance. We derive analytical expressions for the optimal measurement that minimizes the prediction error for any arbitrary observable and any two-qubit state. We establish a direct, quantitative link between the ability to surpass the fundamental limit of local unpredictability and the presence of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering. Additionally, by optimizing measurement choices according to the minimal Bayes risk, we propose a modified entanglement-based quantum key distribution protocol achieving higher secure key rates than the standard BB84 protocol, demonstrating enhanced resilience to noise. We apply our framework in two scenarios: perfect Bell states affected by local amplitude-damping noises, and top-antitop quark pairs produced in high-energy colliders. Our work offers a novel perspective on quantum correlations, connecting statistical inference, fundamental quantum phenomena, and cryptographic applications.

Title:
Deep-Inelastic Scattering at TeV Energies with LHC Muons

The LHC far-forward experiments FASER and SND@LHC have pioneered the detection of TeV-energy neutrinos produced in hard-scattering proton-proton collisions at the LHC. In addition to neutrinos, an intense flux of TeV-energy muons reaches these detectors, representing a dominant background for both neutrino studies and beyond the Standard Model searches. Here we demonstrate that this forward muon flux enables a comprehensive neutral-current deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) program at FASER with a strong kinematical overlap with the Electron Ion Collider. For the Run 3 luminosity of $\mathcal{L}_{\rm pp}=250$~fb$^{-1}$, more than $10^5$ inclusive muon DIS events, of which up to $10^4$ from charm production, are expected at FASER$\nu$. As a representative application, we demonstrate the sensitivity of muon DIS at FASER$\nu$ to probe the (intrinsic) charm content of the proton at large-$x$. We also provide predictions for event yields of muon DIS for future FASER runs and for the proposed Forward Physics Facility.

Heavy Mesons to Open-Charmed Tetraquark Decays

Motivated by the recent observations of $T^*_{cs0}(2870)^0$, $T^*_{c\bar s 0}(2900)^0$ and $T^*_{c\bar s 0}(2900)^{++}$ open-charmed tetraquark states by LHCb, we study the decays of heavy mesons to these open-charmed tetraquark states ($T$) using a topological amplitude approach. We first obtain the $T\to DP$ and $DS$ strong decay amplitudes by decomposing them into several topological amplitudes, where $P$ is a light pseudo-scalar particle and $S$ is a low-lying scalar particle. Subsequently, weak decay amplitudes of $\overline B\to D\overline T$, $\overline D T$ and $\overline B\to TP$, $TS$ decays are decomposed topologically. In addition, $B^-_c\to T\overline T$ decays are also discussed. Using these results, modes with an unambiguous exotic interpretation in flavor are highlighted.

We perform systematical investigations of heavy flavor tetraquark systems, including fully heavy $QQ\bar Q\bar Q$ ($Q=b,c$), doubly heavy $QQ^{(\prime)}\bar q\bar q$ ($q=u,d$), and singly heavy $Qs\bar q\bar q$ tetraquark systems, within the framework of quark potential model. We employ the Gaussian expansion method and complex scaling method to solve the four-body Hamiltonian and identify bound and resonant states. We further calculate the root mean square radii to study the spatial configurations of tetraquarks. Our calculations reveal a rich spectrum of tetraquark states exhibiting diverse spatial configurations. In particular, we find good candidates for experimental states $X(6900)$, $X(7200)$, $T_{cc}(3875)^+$, and $T_{\bar c\bar s0}^*(2870)$. The fully charmed tetraquark resonances $X(6900)$ and $X(7200)$ are compact teraquark states, while doubly charmed tetraquark bound state $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ and charm-strange tetraquark resonance $T_{\bar c\bar s0}^*(2870)$ are meson molecules. Additionally, more tetraquark bound and resonant states are predicted and may be searched for in future experiments.
