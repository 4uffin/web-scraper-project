This paper describes the cryogenic and purification systems of the ICARUS T600 detector in its present implementation at the Fermi National Laboratory, Illinois, USA. The ICARUS T600 detector is made of four large Time Projection Chambers, installed in two separate containers of about 275 m3 each. The detector uses liquid argon both as target and as active media. For the correct operation of the detector, the liquid argon must be kept in very stable thermal conditions and the contamination of electronegative impurities must be consistently kept at the level of small fractions of parts per billion. The detector was previously operated in Italy, at the INFN Gran Sasso Underground laboratory, in a 3 year duration run on the CERN to LNGS Long Baseline Neutrino Beam. For its operation on the Booster and NuMI neutrino beams, at Fermilab, for the search of sterile neutrinos and measurements of neutrino-argon cross sections, the detector was moved from Gran Sasso to CERN for the upgrades required for operation at shallow depth with high intensity neutrino beams. The liquid argon containers, the thermal insulation and all the cryogenic equipment, have been completely re-designed and rebuild, following the schemes of the previous installation in Gran Sasso. The detector and all the equipment have been transported to Fermilab, where they have been installed, tested and recently put into operation. The work described in this paper has been conducted as a joint responsibility of CERN and Fermilab with the supervision provided by the Icarus Collaboration. Design, installation, testing, commissioning and operation is the result of a common effort of CERN, Fermilab and INFN Groups.

The $pp \to W^{\pm} (\to \mu^{\pm} \nu_{\mu}) X$ cross-sections are measured at a proton-proton centre-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s} = 5.02$ TeV using a dataset corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 100 pb$^{-1}$ recorded by the LHCb experiment. Considering muons in the pseudorapidity range $2.2 < \eta < 4.4$, the cross-sections are measured differentially in twelve intervals of muon transverse momentum between $28 < p_\mathrm{T} < 52$ GeV. Integrated over $p_\mathrm{T}$, the measured cross-sections are \begin{align*} \sigma_{W^+ \to \mu^+ \nu_\mu} &= 300.9 \pm 2.4 \pm 3.8 \pm 6.0~\text{pb}, \\ \sigma_{W^- \to \mu^- \bar{\nu}_\mu} &= 236.9 \pm 2.1 \pm 2.7 \pm 4.7~\text{pb}, \end{align*} where the first uncertainties are statistical, the second are systematic, and the third are associated with the luminosity calibration. These integrated results are consistent with theoretical predictions.
This analysis introduces a new method to determine the $W$-boson mass using the measured differential cross-sections corrected for detector effects. The measurement is performed on this statistically limited dataset as a proof of principle and yields \begin{align*} m_W = 80369 \pm 130 \pm 33~\text{MeV}, \end{align*} where the first uncertainty is experimental and the second is theoretical.

A search is presented for the electroweak production of a top quark pair in association with a $W$ boson and at least one additional jet, known as the ${t\bar{t}W\kern-0.2em j_{\mathrm{EW}}}$ process. This process has embedded within it a $tW$-scattering vertex, which is probed directly for the first time. The collision data were collected with the ATLAS detector during Run 2 of the LHC and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 140 $\mathrm{fb^{-1}}$ at $\sqrt{s}=13$~TeV. The search uses same-charge pairs of electrons and muons together with jets, of which at least one is $b$-tagged. The properties of the most forward jet relative to the rest of the event are used to discriminate the electroweak ${t\bar{t}W\kern-0.2em j_{\text{EW}}}$ production process from its strong $t\bar{t}W$ production counterpart. A measured (expected) 95% CL upper limit on the cross section is set at $\sigma_{{t\bar{t}W\kern-0.2em j_{\mathrm{EW}}}} < 251$~fb (230 fb), to be compared with the expected SM cross section of 47.7 fb. Limits are set on the SM Effective Field Theory (EFT) operators $O_{Ht}$ and $O^{(1)}_{HQ}$, which modify the electroweak couplings of the top quark through contributions to the $tW$-scattering vertex. The interpretation acts as a case study to emphasize the importance of energy-dependent sensitivity, multi-process and multi-operator EFT contributions.

Experimental overview on the charmed baryon decays

High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)
The charmed baryon was first observed experimentally in 1975, one year after the charm quark's confirmation via the discovery of the $J/\psi$ particle. Studying charmed baryon decays provides a pathway to investigate both strong and weak interactions, leveraging the weak decays of the embedded charm quark. However, for approximately three decades following its discovery, experimental knowledge of charmed baryons remained significantly limited compared to those of the hidden-charm $\psi$ mesons and open-charm $D_{(s)}$ mesons. This situation changed markedly starting in 2014, when dedicated data collection for charmed baryons commenced at BESIII. In this article, we review the experimental progress achieved since 2014 in understanding the weak decays of the charmed baryons.

Title:
Selection rules for charged lepton flavour violating processes from residual flavour groups

Subjects:

We systematically investigate the possible phenomenological impact of residual flavour groups in the charged lepton sector. We consider all possible flavour charge assignments for abelian residual symmetries up to Z8. The allowed flavour structures of operators in Standard Model Effective Field Theory (up to dimension six) lead to distinctive and observable patterns of charged lepton flavour violating processes. We illustrate the relevance of such selection rules displaying the current bounds on and the future sensitivities to the new physics scale. These results demonstrate, in particular, the importance and discriminating power of searches for lepton flavour violating tau lepton decays and muonium to antimuonium conversion.

$\text{Dark}_{CP}$ Mesogenesis and New Implications for Collider Searches
Gilly Elor

Subjects:

We introduce $\text{Dark}_{CP}$ Mesogenesis in which Standard Model mesons, either $B_{s,d}^0$, $B^\pm$ or $B_c^\pm$, undergo out-of-equilibrium dark CP violating decays to Standard Model and dark sector baryons. With order one CP violation in the dark sector, the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe can then be generated with branching fractions as small as $2.7 \times 10^{-8}$ for the exotic decay of $B$-mesons into baryons and missing energy. This sets a lower limit on the branching fraction below which Mesogenesis becomes disfavored. This work therefore strongly encourages collider searches to target sensitivities one to three orders of magnitude below planned limits. For completeness, we further introduce a variant on $\text{Dark}_{CP}$ Mesogenesis involving dark lepton states. We conclude by laying out a roadmap for the complete exclusion (or discovery) of the Mesogenesis framework.

The weak mixing angle $s_W$ is a fundamental constant in the Standard Model (SM) and measured at the $Z$ boson mass to be $\widehat{s}^2_W(m_Z) = 0.23129 \pm 0.00004$ in the $\overline{\rm MS}$ renormalization scheme, where $m_Z=91.2\ \text{GeV}$. On the other hand, non-stabilizerness - the magic - characterizes the computational advantage of a quantum system over classical computers. We consider the production of magic from stabilizer initial states, which carry zero magic, in the 2-to-2 scattering of charged leptons in the SM at the tree level, which is mediated by the photon and the $Z$ boson. Using the second order stabilizer Rényi entropy, and averaging over all 60 initial stabilizer states and the scattering angle, we compute and minimize the magic production as a function of $s^2_W$ in the Møller scattering $e^-e^-\to e^-e^-$, which is free of kinematic thresholds. At the centre-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s}=m_Z$, there is a unique minimum in magic production at $\mathbf{s}^{2}_W(m_Z)=0.2317$, which agrees with the measured $\widehat{s}^2_W(m_Z)$ at the sub-percent level. At higher energies, the magic-minimizing $\mathbf{s}^{2}_W$ continues to agree with the empirical value at the percent level or better, up to 10 TeV. The finding suggests the electroweak sector of the SM tends to generate minimal quantum resources from the computational viewpoint.

Probing Quark Electromagnetic Properties via Entangled Quark Pairs in Fragmentation Hadrons at Lepton Colliders

Electromagnetic dipole interactions of light quarks induce distinct spin correlations in quark pairs produced at lepton colliders, favoring entangled spin-triplet state aligned along the $\hat{z}$ axis or spin-singlet state. These correlations lead to unique $\cos(\phi_1-\phi_2)$ azimuthal asymmetries in inclusive $\pi^+\pi^-$-dihadron pair production and in back-to-back hadron pairs ($\pi\pi,K\pi,KK$), which are absent in the SM. By analyzing Belle and BaBar data and using ratios of azimuthal asymmetries, we demonstrate that these measurements provide robust and significant constraints on light-quark dipole couplings, insensitive to nonperturbative fragmentation functions and free from contamination by other new physics effects. This approach offers a clean and novel probe of light-quark dipole interactions in collider experiments.

The Surface Detector (SD) of the Pierre Auger Observatory is a 3000 km$^2$ array of stations, whose main components are Water-Cherenkov Detectors (WCDs) recording ground-level signals from extensive air showers (EASs) initiated by Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs). Understanding the physics of UHECRs requires knowledge of their mass composition, for which the number of ground muons is a key probe. Isolating the muon component is difficult, as different types of particles contribute to the SD signal. We apply a recurrent neural network to estimate the muon content of the SD signals, showing small bias in simulations and weak dependence on selected hadronic interaction model.

As physicists pursue precision neutrino measurements, complementary experiments covering varied oscillation landscapes have become essential for resolving current tensions in global fits. This thesis presents projected sensitivities and forecasted performance of two next-generation long-baseline experiments: DUNE and T2HK, through detailed simulations addressing fundamental questions including neutrino mass ordering, leptonic CP violation, and the octant of $\theta_{23}$. We demonstrate through simulated analyses that while each experiment alone faces inherent degeneracies, their complementary features enable breakthrough projected sensitivities in both standard oscillation parameter measurements and forecasted searches for new physics beyond the Standard Model. The combined simulation results reveal that DUNE-T2HK synergy will be crucial for achieving a comprehensive understanding of neutrino properties in the coming decade.

Phonon sensitive superconducting qubits promise to provide sub-eV energy deposit thresholds, useful for future rare-event experiments looking for interactions from dark matter and neutrinos. We detail here engineering results from a Quantum Parity Detector (QPDs), one of a class of phonon sensitive qubits, and, as a first measurement, show that this device has a quiescent quasiparticle density of $1.8 \pm 0.8 \mu \mathrm{m}^{-3}$, in line with expectation. We also outline an argon ion-mill process for multi-step Josephson Junction fabrication, expanding the sparse literature on this topic, which proves useful in avoiding secondary parasitic junctions.

Superfluorescence, a cooperative emission phenomenon arising from the coherent coupling of excited dipoles, has historically been observed under optical excitation in carefully engineered quantum systems. Here, we report the first observation of superfluorescence triggered by ionizing radiation in lead-halide perovskite nanocrystal (NC) superlattices. Using CsPbBr3 NC superlattices with long-range structural and electronic order, we demonstrate that secondary electrons generated by high-energy photons can induce efficient cooperative emission bursts characteristic of superfluorescence with unprecedented scintillation lifetime of ~40 ps, thereby introducing a new class of coherent scintillating metamaterials. Side-by-side optical and scintillation measurements reveal a direct analogy between ionizing and intense optical excitation, both leading to high excitonic densities that result in superfluorescent emission, even at mild, technologically accessible cryogenic temperatures. The discovery that incoherent, stochastic ionization cascades can seed coherent many-body optical responses with radiatively accelerated luminescence and large Stokes shifts establishes a pathway toward ultrafast, reabsorption-free, quantum-ordered nanotechnological scintillators, paving the way for the future development of radiation detectors based on quantum technologies for advanced radiation detection applications.

We examine the central tenet of the current standard theory of neutrino oscillations, namely the assumption that neutrinos are emitted and detected as flavour neutrino states, which are coherent superpositions of massive neutrino states of different masses. We prove that all the quantum mechanical and quantum field theoretical arguments, including the invocation of the uncertainty principle and the wave packet description of massive neutrinos, entail the production of neutrinos as statistical ensembles of massive neutrino states. As the states in a statistical ensemble do not interfere, neutrino oscillations cannot be explained by the superposition of massive states. We point out that neutrino oscillations in vacuum can be consistently formulated in theories which include, among other assumptions, the premise that the asymptotic states are massless flavour neutrinos.

Limited radiation hardness is the primary drawback to implementing Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) in high-luminosity environments, such as the Compressed Baryonic Matter (CBM) experiment. Hadron irradiation generates defects in the silicon lattice of SiPMs, increasing dark current, dark count rate (DCR), crosstalk, and afterpulsing, while degrading gain and photon resolution. The expected radiation dose in the photon camera of the Ring Imaging Cherenkov detector of the CBM experiment ranges from $8\times 10^9$ to $5\times 10^{10}$ n$_{\text{eq}}$/cm$^2$ after two-months of operation at maximum beam energy and intensity. In this work, we evaluated the radiation hardness of three different SiPMs: AFBR-S4N66P024M, S14160-6050HS, and MICROFC-60035. The samples were exposed to neutron irradiation with doses ranging from $3\times 10^8$ to $1\times 10^{11}$ n$_{\text{eq}}$/cm$^2$. The neutron radiation damage was found to increase the SiPM dark current up to $10^3$ times, DCR up to $10^2$ times, and afterpulsing up to $10\%$ while decreasing their gain and photon resolution. We performed electrical annealing (250 $^{\circ}$C/30 min) on the samples to recover the photon resolution and decrease the DCR and dark current.

The gradients act as invisible engines of transport, converting microscopic imbalances into macroscopic flows, and thus providing deep insights into the dynamics of physical systems. Thermal gradients do not merely drive the flow of heat, but they also set the microscopic constituents of the system into motion. In such scenarios, the constituents of the system not only transport energy but also diffuse collectively under the influence of these gradients. For the very first time, we present a first-principles investigation of the Soret and Dufour effects in hot and dense quantum chromodynamics (QCD) matter. We use the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation under the relaxation time approximation. By incorporating chemical potential and temperature gradients into the kinetic theory framework, we derive explicit expressions for the Dufour coefficient, which quantifies the heat flow due to concentration gradients, and the Soret coefficient, which describes the particle diffusion induced by thermal gradients. These coupled-transport phenomena are traditionally studied in multi-component classical systems at low energy scales. In this study, we follow quasiparticle models for the deconfined phase and the hadron resonance gas model for the confined hadronic phase in the context of heavy-ion collisions. This study provides novel insights into the thermo-diffusion and diffusion-thermo phenomena and opens avenues for incorporating such effects in hydrodynamic modeling and transport simulations of QCD matter.

This paper describes a measurement of the $\Lambda_b^0\to J/\psi\Lambda$ branching fraction using data collected with the LHCb experiment in proton-proton collisions from 2016 to 2018. The dataset corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 5.4$\,\text{fb}^{-1}$. The branching fraction is determined relative to that of $B^0\to J/\psi K^0_\text{S}$ decays, $\frac{\mathcal{B}(\Lambda_b^0\to J/\psi\Lambda)}{\mathcal{B}(B^0\to J/\psi K^0_\text{S}} = 0.750 \pm 0.005 \pm 0.022 \pm 0.005 \pm 0.062\,,$ yielding $\mathcal{B}(\Lambda_b^0\to J/\psi\Lambda) = (3.34 \pm 0.02 \pm 0.10 \pm 0.08 \pm 0.28)\times 10^{-4}$, where the first uncertainty is statistical, the second systematic, the third due to external inputs on branching fractions and the fourth due to the ratio of $\Lambda_b^0$ baryon and $B^0$ meson hadronisation fractions. In addition, the isospin asymmetry between the rates of $B^0\to J/\psi K^0_\text{S}$ and $B^+\to J/\psi K^+$ decays is measured to be $A_{\rm I} = -0.0135 \pm 0.0004 \pm 0.0133$, where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second systematic.

Dark matter makes up approximately 85% of total matter in our universe, yet it has never been directly observed in any laboratory on Earth. The origin of dark matter is one of the most important questions in contemporary physics, and a convincing detection of dark matter would be a Nobel-Prize-level breakthrough in fundamental science. The ABRACADABRA experiment was specifically designed to search for dark matter. Although it has not yet made a discovery, ABRACADABRA has produced several dark matter search results widely endorsed by the physics community. The experiment generates ultra-long time-series data at a rate of 10 million samples per second, where the dark matter signal would manifest itself as a sinusoidal oscillation mode within the ultra-long time series. In this paper, we present the TIDMAD -- a comprehensive data release from the ABRACADABRA experiment including three key components: an ultra-long time series dataset divided into training, validation, and science subsets; a carefully-designed denoising score for direct model benchmarking; and a complete analysis framework which produces a community-standard dark matter search result suitable for publication as a physics paper. This data release enables core AI algorithms to extract the signal and produce real physics results thereby advancing fundamental science.

Title:

In a cosmological first-order phase transition (FOPT), the true and false vacuum bubble radius distributions are not expected to be monochromatic, as is usually assumed. Consequently, Fermi balls (FBs) and primordial black holes (PBHs) produced in a dark FOPT will have extended mass distributions. We show how gravitational wave (GW), microlensing and Hawking evaporation signals for extended bubble radius/mass distributions deviate from the case of monochromatic distributions. The peak of the GW spectrum is shifted to lower frequencies, and the spectrum is broadened at frequencies below the peak frequency. Thus, the radius distribution of true vacuum bubbles introduces another uncertainty in the evaluation of the GW spectrum from a FOPT. The extragalactic gamma-ray signal at AMEGO-X/e-ASTROGAM from PBH evaporation may evince a break in the power-law spectrum between 5 MeV and 10 MeV for an extended PBH mass distribution. Optical microlensing surveys may observe PBH mass distributions with average masses below $10^{-10} M_\odot$, which is not possible for monochromatic mass distributions. This expands the FOPT parameter space that can be explored with microlensing.

The FAIR Universe -- HiggsML Uncertainty Challenge focuses on measuring the physics properties of elementary particles with imperfect simulators due to differences in modelling systematic errors. Additionally, the challenge is leveraging a large-compute-scale AI platform for sharing datasets, training models, and hosting machine learning competitions. Our challenge brings together the physics and machine learning communities to advance our understanding and methodologies in handling systematic (epistemic) uncertainties within AI techniques.

Title:
The probability for chiral oscillation of Majorana neutrino in Quantum Field Theory

We derive the probability for chiral oscillation of Majorana neutrinos based on quantum field theory. Since the Hamiltonian under the Majorana mass term does not conserve lepton number, the eigenstates of lepton number change continuously over time. Therefore, the transition amplitude is described by the inner product of the eigenstates of lepton number at the time of the neutrino production and the detection. With the Bogoliubov transformation, we successfully relates the lepton number eigenstates at different times. This method enables us to understand the time variation of lepton number induced by chiral oscillations in terms of transition probabilities. We also present the physical picture that emerges through the Bogoliubov transformation.

Low Gain Avalanche Diodes, also known as LGADs, are widely considered for fast-timing applications in high energy physics, nuclear physics, space science, medical imaging, and precision measurements of rare processes. Such devices are silicon-based and feature an intrinsic gain due to a $p{^+}$-doped layer that allows the production of a controlled avalanche of carriers, with multiplication on the order of 10-100. This technology can provide time resolution on the order of 20-30 ps, and variants of this technology can provide precision tracking too. The characterization of LGAD performance has so far primarily been focused on the interaction of minimum ionizing particles for high energy and nuclear physics applications. This article expands the study of LGAD performance to highly-ionizing particles, such as 28-MeV protons, which are relevant for several future scientific applications, e.g. in biology and medical physics, among others. These studies were performed with a beam of 28-MeV protons from a tandem Van de Graaff accelerator at Brookhaven National Laboratory and beta particles from a $^{90}{\rm Sr}$ source; these were used to characterize the response and the gain of an LGAD as a function of bias voltage and collected charge. The experimental results are also compared to TCAD simulations.

Title:
Sensitivity of a Gigahertz Fabry-Pérot Resonator for Axion Dark Matter Detection

Axions are hypothetical pseudo-Nambu Goldstone bosons that could explain the observed cold dark matter density and solve the strong CP problem of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Haloscope experiments commonly employ resonant cavities to search for a conversion of axion dark matter into photons in external magnetic fields. As the expected signal power degrades with increasing frequency, this approach becomes challenging at frequencies beyond tens of Gigahertz. Here, we propose a novel haloscope design based on an open Fabry-Pérot resonator. Operating a small-scale resonator at cryogenic temperatures and at modest magnetic fields should already lead to an unparalleled sensitivity for photon-axion couplings $g_{a\gamma} \gtrsim 3\times10^{-12}\,\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ at 35GHz. We demonstrate how this sensitivity could be further improved using graded-phase mirrors and sketch possibilities to probe benchmark models of the QCD axion.

Title:
Accessing nucleon transversity with one-point energy correlators

We propose a novel probe of the nucleon's transversity distribution, $h_1^q$, using the one-point energy correlator (OPEC), an infrared-and-collinear safe jet substructure observable. We demonstrate that in transversely polarized $p^{\uparrow}p$ collisions, the OPEC exhibits a single-spin asymmetry (SSA) with a clean $\sin(\phi_s - \phi_n)$ angular dependence. This method probes SSA over a much wider kinematic range in the angular scale $\theta_n$ compared to traditional measurements of hadron transverse momentum~$j_\perp$, establishing a complementary and systematically distinct channel to study the nucleon's three-dimensional structure at RHIC and the future Electron-Ion Collider.
