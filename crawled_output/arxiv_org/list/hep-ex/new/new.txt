High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)
A novel experiment is introduced to detect photon-axion conversion independent of the dark-matter hypothesis in a broad mass-range called WISP Interferometer (WINTER). The setup consists of a free-space Mach-Zehnder-type interferometer incorporating an external magnetic field and vacuum in one of the arms, where photon-axion mixing occurs via the Primakoff effect and is detected through changes in amplitude. The expected axion-induced signal is then modulated by polarization changes. The experiment is designed to integrate a Fabry-Pérot cavity with a finesse of $10^{5}$ that will be operated in a vacuum environment, significantly enhancing the sensitivity. The setup is sensitive to photon-axion coupling strengths values $g_{a\gamma\gamma}\gtrsim 5.5\times10^{-15}$ $\text{GeV}^{-1}$ for axion masses up to 84.8 $\mu$eV

The Dark Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) has made significant progress in measuring the fluxes of cosmic rays. These new measurements are pivotal in advancing our understanding of the origins and propagation mechanisms of cosmic rays. The bismuth germanium oxide (BGO) calorimeter plays a crucial role in these measurements, particularly in the precise determination of cosmic ray fluxes. However, for a calorimetric experiment like DAMPE, uncertainties in hadronic models persist as a major barrier in achieving more accurate measurements of fluxes of cosmic ray nuclei. This study centers on the measurement of the inelastic hadronic cross sections of carbon and oxygen nuclei interacting with BGO crystals target over an extensive energy range, spanning from 200 GeV to 10 TeV. For carbon nuclei interacting with the BGO target, the measurements of the cross sections have achieved a total relative uncertainty of less than 10% below 8 TeV for carbon, and below 3 TeV for oxygen. For oxygen nuclei, the same level of precision was attained below 3 TeV. Additionally, we compare the experimental results with Geant4 and FLUKA simulations to validate the accuracy and consistency of these simulation tools. Through comprehensive analysis of the inelastic hadronic interaction cross sections, this research provides validation for the hadronic interaction models used in DAMPE's cosmic-ray flux measurements.

In high-energy physics~(HEP) experiments, visualization software plays a pivotal role in detector design, offline software development, and event data analysis. The visualization tools integrate detailed detector geometry with complex event data models, providing the researchers with invaluable insights into experimental results. Phoenix is an emerging general-purpose visualization platform for the current and next-generation HEP experiments. In this study, we develop an event display software based on Phoenix for the CEPC experiment. It offers necessary functionalities for visualizing detector geometries and displaying event data, allowing the researchers to optimize detector design, test simulation and reconstruction algorithms, and analyze event data in a visualized way. Additionally, we discuss the future applications of the event display software, including its usage in online monitoring and the potential to build virtual reality projects for enhanced data visualization.

Title:
Facilitating neutron and energy reconstruction in neutrino events using the direction of tagged neutrons

Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)
To date, accelerator neutrino experiments have had only limited success including neutrons in the neutrino event reconstruction event by event. Produced neutrons often interact in a detector leaving an energy deposition that does not correlate strongly with the kinetic energy of the neutron. This work explores the inclusion of the direction of a neutron tagged by such an energy deposition in concert with the missing transverse momentum of the reconstructed particles to determine the approximate kinetic energy of the neutron and modify the reconstruction of the energy of the incoming neutrino. The technique significantly increases the neutron kinetic energy estimation relative to one that assigns the neutron kinetic energy by enforcing transverse momentum balance alone. When included in the neutrino energy calculation, the neutrino energy resolution is improved and the reconstructed energy is distributed more symmetrically around the true value. The technique shows promise and might be used to good effect to analyze data taken with experiments able to tag neutron energy deposits with good neutron direction resolution such as the T2K near detector and the liquid argon detectors in the SBN program and DUNE.

Title:
Measurement of transverse polarization of $Λ$ and $\barΛ$ hyperons inside jets in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=200$ GeV
The STAR collaboration
Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)
We report the first measurement of $\Lambda$ and $\overline{\Lambda}$ transverse polarization inside jets in unpolarized proton-proton collisions, which is attributed to the polarizing fragmentation function (PFF). The polarization is measured as a function of the jet transverse momentum ($p_{\text{T}}$), the fraction of the jet momentum carried by $\Lambda$($\overline{\Lambda}$) hyperons, and the transverse momentum of $\Lambda\:(\overline{\Lambda})$ hyperons relative to the jet axis. $\Lambda$ polarization shows a clear dependence on the jet $p_{\text{T}}$, changing sign from negative to positive from low to high jet $p_{\text{T}}$, while $\overline{\Lambda}$ polarization mostly remains negative. These data cover a wide range of jet energies, and will provide the first constraints on the gluon PFF, which is not constrained by $e^+e^-$ data. Moreover, these results provide an opportunity to test the transverse momentum-dependent (TMD) evolution effect and its universality for PFF, thus are important input to a complete understanding of the transverse polarization mechanism.

High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)
The BESIII experiment is a symmetric e+ e- collider experiment operating at center-of-mass energies from 2.0 to 4.95 GeV. With the world's largest threshold production data set, including 10 billion J/psi events, 2.7 billion psi(3686) events, 7.9 fb^{-1} of D meson pairs from psi(3770) decay, and 7.33 fb^{-1} of D_s D_s^* events between 4.128 and 4.226 GeV, we are able to probe for new physics through precision tests of the Standard Model, searches for exotic low-mass particles, and investigations of forbidden or rare decay processes. In this talk, we report recent studies on Beyond the Standard Model physics conducted by the BESIII collaboration, including searches for axion-like particles, dark photons, QCD axions, and invisible decays of K_S^0. In addition, a series of rare charm decay processes, including searches for lepton and baryon number violation, flavor-changing neutral current processes, and charmonium weak decays, are also investigated to search for new physics at BESIII.

The T2K ND280 upgrade aims to reduce the systematic uncertainty of the CP-violating phase, $\delta_{CP}$, to reject non-CP violation hypothesis at $3\sigma$ confidence level. A crucial component of the ND280 upgrade, alongside the Super Fine Grained Detector (SuperFGD) and two High-Angle Time Projection Chambers (TPCs), is the Time-of-Flight (ToF) detector, which significantly enhances background rejection and particle identification capabilities. The ToF detector features six modules in a cube configuration, each with 20 plastic scintillator bars measuring $\text{220}\times\text{12}\times\text{1}\,\text{cm}^3$ and is equipped with Silicon Photomultiplier (SiPM) arrays at both ends to capture scintillation light. This letter outlines the modelling of the detector response and the signal reconstruction process.

Improving the modeling of neutrino-nuclei interactions using data-driven methods is crucial for high-precision neutrino oscillation experiments. This paper investigates Peelle's Pertinent Puzzle (PPP) in the context of neutrino measurements, a longstanding challenge to fitting theoretical models to experimental data. Inconsistencies in data-model comparisons hinder efforts to enhance the accuracy and reliability of model predictions. We analyze various sources contributing to these inconsistencies and propose strategies to address them, supported by practical case studies. We advocate for incorporating model fitting exercises as a standard practice in cross section publications to enhance the robustness of results. We use a common analysis framework to explore PPP-related challenges with MicroBooNE and T2K data in an unified manner. Our findings offer valuable insights for improving the accuracy and reliability of neutrino-nuclei interaction models, particularly by systematically tuning models using data.

The Any Light Particle Search II (ALPS II) is a light shining through a wall experiment probing the existence of axions and axion-like particles using a 1064 nm laser source. While ALPS II is already taking data using a heterodyne based detection scheme, cryogenic transition edge sensor (TES) based single-photon detectors are planned to expand the detection system for cross-checking the potential signals, for which a sensitivity on the order of $10^{-24}$ W is required. In order to reach this goal, we have investigated the use of convolutional neural networks (CNN) as binary classifiers to distinguish the experimentally measured 1064 nm photon triggered (light) pulses from background (dark) pulses. Despite extensive hyperparameter optimization, the CNN based binary classifier did not outperform our previously optimized cut-based analysis in terms of detection significance. This suggests that the used approach is not generally suitable for background suppression and improving the energy resolution of the TES. We partly attribute this to the training confusion induced by near-1064 nm black-body photon triggers in the background, which we identified as the limiting background source as concluded in our previous works. However, we argue that the problem ultimately lies in the binary classification based approach and believe that regression models would be better suitable for addressing the energy resolution. Unsupervised machine learning models, in particular neural network based autoencoders, should also be considered potential candidates for the suppression of noise in time traces. While the presented results and associated conclusions are obtained for TES designed to be used in the ALPS II experiment, they should hold equivalently well for any device whose output signal can be considered as a univariate time trace.

The LZ experiment is a liquid xenon time-projection chamber (TPC) searching for evidence of particle dark matter interactions. In the simplest assumption of elastic scattering, many dark matter models predict an energy spectrum which rises quasi-exponentially with decreasing energy transfer to a target atom. LZ expects to detect coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering of $^{8}$B solar neutrinos, the signal from which is very similar to a dark matter particle with mass of about 5.5 GeV/$c^{2}$, which result in typical nuclear recoil energies of $<$5 keV$_{\text{nr}}$. Therefore, it is of crucial importance to calibrate the response of recoiling xenon nuclei to keV-energy recoils. This analysis details the first in situ photoneutron calibration of the LZ detector and probes its response in this energy regime.

Physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) has yet to be observed at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), motivating the development of model-agnostic, machine learning-based strategies to probe more regions of the phase space. As many final states have not yet been examined for mass resonances, an accelerated approach to bump-hunting is desirable. BumpNet is a neural network trained to map smoothly falling invariant-mass histogram data to statistical significance values. It provides a unique, automatized approach to mass resonance searches with the capacity to scan hundreds of final states reliably and efficiently.

We present a study of the emission of Cherenkov radiation in thick media, explore the limitations of the simulation tools currently in use in particle and nuclear physics, and propose a method for overcoming these limitations. We start with a derivation of the Cherenkov power spectrum and its angular profile, accounting for interference of the radiation emitted, in contrast with commonly used tools that assume perfect coherence. We then study the impact that the path of electrons through a medium has on the angular profile of Cherenkov light. Finally, we devise a model that can introduce these effects in Geant4 and tune it to explain calibration data from the water-phase of SNO+. We find that the tuned model significantly improves the agreement between data and simulation, so we provide it for its wider use.

Detector and event visualization are crucial components of high-energy physics~(HEP) experimental software. Virtual Reality~(VR) technologies and multimedia development platforms such as Unity offer enhanced display effects and flexible extensibility for visualization in HEP experiments. In this study, we present a VR-based method for detector and event displays in the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory~(JUNO) experiment. This method shares the same detector geometry descriptions and event data model as those in offline software and provides necessary data conversion interfaces. The VR methodology facilitates an immersive exploration of the virtual environment in JUNO, enabling users to investigate detector geometry, visualize event data, and tune the detector simulation and event reconstruction algorithms. Additionally, this approach supports applications in data monitoring, physics data analysis, and public outreach initiatives.

We study the viability of light thermal dark matter (DM) in sub-GeV mass range in view of the stringent new DAMIC-M limits on DM-electron scattering. Considering a Dirac fermion singlet DM charged under a new Abelian gauge symmetry $U(1)$, we outline two possibilities: (i) family non-universal $U(1)$ gauge coupling with resonantly enhanced DM annihilation into standard model (SM) fermions and (ii) family universal dark $U(1)$ gauge symmetry where relic is set by DM annihilation into light gauge bosons. As an illustrative example of the first class of models, we consider a gauged $L_\mu-L_\tau$ extension of the SM having interesting detection prospects at several experiments. While both of these class of models lead to observed DM relic and consistency with DAMIC-M together with other experimental limits, the second class of models also lead to strong DM self-interactions, potentially solving the small-scale structure issues of cold dark matter. While a vast part of the parameter space in both the models is already ruled out, the current allowed region of parameter space can be further probed at ongoing or future experiments keeping the models testable.

We present a systematic study of triple Higgs boson production at future high-energy hadron colliders, using the six-$b$-jet final state as a probe of the Higgs self-interactions. We conduct, under realistic detector smearing assumptions, both a traditional cut-based analysis, and a multivariate one using gradient boosting. The multivariate strategy is found to enhance sensitivity to beyond the Standard Model effects on the Higgs boson's self-couplings, while preserving large signal event yields, thus enabling more robust statistical inference. This allows us to assess the impact of detector effects, systematic uncertainties, background normalisation, as well as different truncation choices in an effective-field-theory description of the new physics effects possibly affecting the Higgs boson's self-interactions. Our results demonstrate that statistically-meaningful and perturbative-unitarity-compatible constraints on the trilinear and quartic Higgs boson self-couplings can be achieved, provided that systematic uncertainties are controlled at the few-percent level. Finally, we extrapolate our results to various collider energies and luminosities, demonstrating in particular that an 85 TeV proton-proton collider performs comparably to a 100 TeV machine. Altogether, our findings therefore establish the six-$b$ channel as a viable probe of the Higgs self-interactions at most future hadron collider options currently being examined by the high-energy physics community.

We investigate two-body non-leptonic $D\to SS$ weak decays, where $S$ denotes a light scalar meson such as $a_0/a_0(980)$, $f_0/f_0(980)$, or $\sigma_0/f_0(500)$. Short-distance topologies from $W$-boson emission and annihilation (exchange) are found to be negligible, while long-distance final-state interactions provide the dominant contributions. In particular, triangle rescattering processes, $D \to \pi\eta^{(\prime)} \to \sigma_0 a_0$ and $D \to a_1(1260)\eta \to \sigma_0 a_0$, mediated by pion exchange in $\pi\eta^{(\prime)}$ and $a_1(1260)\eta$ scatterings, respectively, are identified as the leading mechanisms. Our calculations yield branching fractions ${\cal B}(D_s^+ \to \sigma_0 a_0^+) = (1.0 \pm 0.2^{+0.1}_{-0.2}) \times 10^{-2}$, ${\cal B}(D^+ \to \sigma_0 a_0^+) = (1.1 \pm 0.2^{+0.1}_{-0.2}) \times 10^{-3}$, and ${\cal B}(D^0 \to \sigma_0 a_0^0) = (0.9 \pm 0.2^{+0.2}_{-0.3}) \times 10^{-5}$. For the Cabibbo-allowed decay mode $D_s^+ \to f_0 a_0^+$, the near-threshold condition $m_{D_s}\simeq m_{f_0}+m_{a_0}$ limits the phase space, suppressing the branching fraction to $(3.4\pm0.3^{+0.4}_{-0.9})\times 10^{-4}$. These results highlight rescattering-induced $D\to SS$ decays as promising channels for experimental studies at BESIII, Belle(-II), and LHCb.

We build a deep neural network model to predict meson widths from quantum numbers and masses based on the Transformer architecture. A Gaussian Monte-Carlo data enhancement method is adopted to enhance the meson data by considering the experimental errors, which significantly increase the data samples and improve the robustness and generalization performance of the model. With the meson widths ranging from $\sim10^{-14}$ to 625 MeV, the relative errors of the predictions behave $0.07\%$, $1.0\%$, and $0.14\%$ in the training set, the test set, and all the data, respectively. The width predictions are presented for the currently discovered mesons and some theoretically predicted states. We also use the model as a probe to study the quantum numbers and inner structures for some undetermined states. Furthermore, this data-driven model is investigated to show well charge conjugation symmetry and approximate isospin symmetry, which is consistent with the physical phenomena. The results indicate that the deep neural network has powerful learning and inference abilities to describe and explore the hadron structures and the complicated interactions in particle physics.

A cryogenic detector system based on two 3.3 kg high-purity CsI crystals was developed and characterized at approximately 95 K. Each wedge-shaped crystal was coupled to dual-ended 3-inch photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) for scintillation readout. The measured light yields were $28.7 \pm 0.9$ and $29.3 \pm 1.0$ photoelectrons per keV electron-equivalent (PE/keV$_{ee}$) for the two crystals, with corresponding energy resolutions of 7.2 \% and 7.7 \% (FWHM) at 59.6 keV. The detector demonstrated excellent spatial uniformity, low intrinsic radioactivity, and stable operation over a continuous one-month period. Optical photon simulations using Geant4 reproduced the observed light collection trends, providing guidance for detector optimization. These results establish cryogenic pure CsI as a scalable technology for low-threshold rare-event searches.

Ultra-high-energy (UHE) neutrinos are unique cosmic messengers that can traverse cosmological distances unattenuated, offering direct insight into the most energetic processes in the universe. Radio detection promises significant advantages for detecting highly inclined air showers induced by UHE neutrinos, including a larger exposure range compared to particle detectors, which is due to minimal atmospheric attenuation of radio signals combined with good reconstruction precision. Furthermore, this technique improves the air shower longitudinal reconstruction, which can be used to identify neutrinos with their first interaction far below the top of the atmosphere. In this work, we present a method for identifying UHE neutrinos using radio antennas deployed in ground-based observatories. We introduce a reconstruction algorithm based on the radio emission maximum ($X^{\text{radio}}_{\text{max}}$) and demonstrate its power in distinguishing deeply developing neutrino-induced showers from background cosmic rays. Using the Pierre Auger Observatory as a case study, we use the simulations of $\nu_e$-CC-induced air showers and evaluate the trigger efficiency, reconstruction performance, and resulting effective area. Our results show that radio detection significantly enhances the sensitivity to very inclined showers above 1~EeV, complementing traditional surface detectors. This technique is highly scalable and applicable to future radio observatories such as GRAND. The proposed reconstruction and identification strategy provides a pathway toward achieving the sensitivity needed to detect UHE neutrinos.

Hybrid Electromagnetic Calorimeter Module: Enhanced Performance through Integration of Silicon Pixel Layer into Scintillator Design

This study constructs a hybrid module with a multi-material collaborative detection architecture by integrating silicon pixel layers into the longitudinally segmented scintillating fiber sampling calorimeter module and optimizes the placement of the silicon layers. The module utilizes the pre-shower characteristics of the front-end scintillator units to ensure sufficient energy deposition in the silicon pixel layers, thereby maintaining its high-precision detection capability. A dedicated simulation framework combining Geant4 modeling for the scintillator section and a parameterized approach for the silicon pixel layer is employed for module verification and performance study. The hybrid module demonstrates overall performance enhancement. The maximum achievable improvements are 56\% for position resolution and 26\% for time resolution, respectively. These advancements also lead to significant increase of physics sensitivity, especially for physics channels with low-energy photons, for instance, a 16\% boost in signal significance for $D^{*0}$ from the $B^-\rightarrow D^{*0}(\rightarrow D^0 \gamma)\pi^-$ decay

We measure the time-integrated CP asymmetry in $D^{0} \rightarrow K^{0}_{S}K^{0}_{S}$ decays reconstructed in $e^{+}e^{-} \rightarrow c\overline{c}$ events collected by the Belle and Belle II experiments. The corresponding data samples have integrated luminosities of 980 fb$^{-1}$ and 428 fb$^{-1}$, respectively. The $D^{0}$ decays are required to originate from the $D^{*+} \rightarrow D^{0}\pi^{+}$ decay, which determines the charm flavor at production time. A control sample of $D^{0} \rightarrow K^{+}K^{-}$ decays is used to correct for production and detection asymmetries. The result, $(-1.4\pm1.3{\rm(stat)}\pm0.1{\rm (syst)})\%$, is consistent with previous determinations and with CP symmetry.

Using 20.3$~\rm fb^{-1}$ of $e^+e^-$ annihilation data collected at a center-of-mass energy of 3.773$~\rm GeV$ with the BESIII detector, we report an improved search for the radiative leptonic decay $D^+\to\gamma e^+\nu_e$. An upper limit on its partial branching fraction for photon energies $E_\gamma>10~\rm MeV$ was determined to be $1.2\times10^{-5}$ at 90\% confidence level; this excludes most current theoretical predictions. A sophisticated deep learning approach, which includes thorough validation and is based on the Transformer architecture, was implemented to efficiently distinguish the signal from massive backgrounds.

This paper analyses neutron multiplicity spectra from massive targets at depths of 3, 40, 210, 583, 1166, and 4000 m.w.e. The measurements, conducted between 2001 and 2024, utilised three experimental setups with either 14 or 60 He-3 neutron detectors and lead (Pb) targets weighing 306, 565, or 1134 kg. The total acquisition time exceeded six years. When available, the acquired spectra were compared with Monte Carlo simulations. Our data challenges the practice of approximating the muon-induced neutron multiplicity spectra with one power-law function $k \times m^{-p}$, where m is the multiplicity, k is the depth-related parameter decreasing with overburden, and p is the slope parameter that remains unchanged with depth. Instead, we see the emergence of a second component. It is evident already in the muon-suppressed spectrum collected on the surface and dominates the spectra at 1166 and 4000 m.w.e. In addition, we see indications of a possible structure in the second component that resembles emissions of approximately 74, 106, 143, and 214 neutrons from the target. Since the anomaly varies only slightly with depth, it is not directly correlated with the muon flux. We propose new underground measurements employing low-cost, large-area, position-sensitive neutron counters to verify and investigate the observed anomalies and ascertain their origin.

We report the results of a search for dark photon dark matter using a cavity that employs a transmon qubit as a frequency tuner. The tuning mechanism utilizes the energy level shift arising from the mode mixing between the qubit and the cavity mode. This method is advantageous in the absence of thermal noise and electromagnetic leakage. We searched for a dark matter signal in the mass range $36.079 \, \mathrm{\mu eV} - 36.176 \, \mathrm{\mu eV}$ and found no significant evidence. As a result, we set the exclusion limit on the kinetic mixing parameter down to approximately $10^{-12}$, surpassing the existing bound set by cosmology.

A search for an invisible particle, $X$, with a mass between 0 and 0.96 $\textrm{GeV}/\textit{c}^{2}$, is performed in the process $J/\psi\rightarrow\phi + X$ using $(8774.0\pm39.4)\times10^{6}$ $J/\psi$ events collected with the BESIII detector from 2017 to 2019. The $\phi$ meson is fully reconstructed and an efficient veto of photons, neutral and charged hadrons up to twice the $K_L^0$ mass is applied to the rest of the event and the recoil mass against the $\phi$ is obtained precisely from the kinematic constraint in the event. No significant signal over the expected background is observed in the investigated region and the upper limit on the inclusive branching fraction of $J/\psi\rightarrow\phi + X$ is determined to be $7.0\times10^{-8}$ at 90\% confidence level. Upper limits at a 90\% confidence level are also given for this branching fraction as a function of the invisible particle mass, varying from $4\times10^{-9}$ to $4\times10^{-8}$ over the investigated mass range. Additionally, a 90\% confidence level upper limit on the branching fraction of $\eta\rightarrow \rm{invisible}$ is determined to $2.4\times10^{-5}$, which improves the previous best results by more than four times. The analysis technique in this work offers a clean window to search for sub-GeV invisible particles, which can be adapted for other $J/\psi$ decays and direct $e^+e^-$ annihilation experiments in future studies, and improve the sensitivity by orders of magnitude.

The lattice dynamics following particle interactions remain not fully understood, and effects from nuclear-recoil interactions in conventional solid-state detectors - such as defect formation - can hinder accurate event-energy interpretation. Neutron capture $(n,\gamma)$ can produce detectable, precise-energy nuclear recoils for detector calibration and solid-state physics studies. This paper proposes a first-of-its-kind experiment to measure the twin products of neutron capture - the postcapture deexcitation gamma and postcapture nuclear recoil. Simulations show that with a 1 mCi californium neutron source, a positive measurement with existing detector technologies is possible in 26.1 gram-days of exposure.

Superconducting transition-edge sensors (TESs) are a type of quantum sensor known for its high single-photon detection efficiency and low background. This makes them ideal for particle physics experiments searching for rare events. In this work, we present a comprehensive characterization of the background in optical TESs, distinguishing three types of events: electrical-noise, high-energy, and photonlike events. We introduce computational methods to automate the classification of events. For the first time, we experimentally verify and simulate the source of the high-energy events. We also isolate the photonlike events, the expected signal in dielectric haloscopes searching for dark matter dark photons, and achieve a record-low photonlike dark-count rate of $3.6 \times 10^{-4}$ Hz in the 0.8-3.2 eV energy range.

We describe how the annihilation of antiprotons can be utilized to generate highly charged isomeric ions in an ion-trap setup. We identify optical transitions in the hyperfine splitting of Hydrogen-like atoms composed of an isomer and a single electron in the ground state. We identify promising candidates in the isomers of Y, Nb, Rh, In, and Sb, for which the hyperfine transition lies in the infrared and whose excited state level lifetime is in the hundreds of milliseconds, which is suitable for metrology applications.

We update the HOMER method, a technique to solve a restricted version of the inverse problem of hadronization -- extracting the Lund string fragmentation function $f(z)$ from data using only observable information. Here, we demonstrate its utility by extracting $f(z)$ from synthetic Pythia simulations using high-level observables constructed on an event-by-event basis, such as multiplicities and shape variables. Four cases of increasing complexity are considered, corresponding to $e^+e^-$ collisions at a center-of-mass energy of $90$ GeV producing either a string stretched between a $q$ and $\bar{q}$ containing no gluons; the same string containing one gluon $g$ with fixed kinematics; the same but the gluon has varying kinematics; and the most realistic case, strings with an unrestricted number of gluons that is the end-result of a parton shower. We demonstrate the extraction of $f(z)$ in each case, with the result of only a relatively modest degradation in performance of the HOMER method with the increased complexity of the string system.

The annual modulation signal, claimed to be consistent with dark matter as observed by DAMA/LIBRA in a sodium-iodide based detector, has persisted for over two decades. COSINE-100 and ANAIS-112 were designed to test the claim directly using the same target material. COSINE-100, located at Yangyang Underground Laboratory in South Korea, and ANAIS-112, located at Canfranc Underground Laboratory in Spain, have been taking data since 2016 and 2017, respectively. Each experiment published its respective results independently. In this paper, we present the results of an annual modulation search as a test of the signal observed by DAMA/LIBRA with the first three respective years of data from COSINE-100 and ANAIS-112. Using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, we find best fit values for modulation amplitude of $-0.0002 {\pm} 0.0026$ cpd/kg/keV in the 1-6 keV and $0.0021 {\pm} 0.0028$ cpd/kg/keV in the 2-6 keV energy regions. These results are not compatible with DAMA/LIBRA's assertion for their observation of annual modulation at $3.7{\sigma}$ and $2.6{\sigma}$, respectively. Performing a simple combination of the newly released 6-years datasets from both experiments find values consistent with no modulation at $0.0005 {\pm} 0.0019$ cpd/kg/keV in the 1-6 keV and $0.0027 {\pm} 0.0021$ cpd/kg/keV in the 2-6 keV energy regions with $4.68{\sigma}$ and $3.53{\sigma}$ respective exclusions of the DAMA/LIBRA signal.

We characterized the front-end electronics used to process high-frequency signals from low-gain avalanche diodes (LGADs) at the Fermilab Test Beam Facility. LGADs are silicon detectors employed for charged particle tracking, offering exceptional spatial and temporal resolution. The purpose of this characterization was to understand how the time resolution is influenced by the front-end electronics. To achieve this, we developed a setup capable of generating input signals with varying amplitudes. The output results demonstrated that signal processing by the front-end electronics plays a crucial role in enhancing time resolution. We showed that the time resolution achieved by the FEE board is better than $2\: ps$ at the $1\sigma$ level.

In view of the recent observation of $CP$-violation in bottom baryon decays, we explore $CP$-asymmetry relations in charmless four-body decays of bottom baryons featuring fully charged hadronic final states. Starting with a general effective Hamiltonian, we derive amplitude relations among various decay modes within the framework of $U$-spin symmetry. These relations lead to symmetry-based predictions for $CP$-violating rate asymmetries in $U$-spin conjugate decay channels. Furthermore, we demonstrate that all leading-order amplitude relations are violated once $U$-spin breaking effects are taken into account.

The N$\nu$DEx experiment aims to search for the neutrinoless double beta decay of $^{82}$Se using a high-pressure $^{82}$SeF$_6$ gas time projection chamber (TPC). Under the assumption of two kinds of charge carriers would be formed, the difference in drift velocities between these ion species enables trigger-less event reconstruction and offers the potential for excellent energy resolution through direct charge collection.
In this study, we present a simulation framework for the N$\nu$DEx ion TPC. The reduced mobilities of SeF$_5^-$ and SeF$_6^-$ ions in SeF$_6$ were calculated using density functional theory and two-temperature theory, yielding values of $0.444 \pm 0.133$ and $0.430 \pm 0.129$ cm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$, respectively.
The TPC geometry, featuring a cathode-focusing plane-anode structure and an 10,000-pixel readout array, was modeled with COMSOL to calculate the electric and weighting fields. Signal and background events were generated using BxDecay0 and Geant4. Garfield++ was used to simulate the transport of charge carriers and signal induction. The induced current was convolved with the transfer function to produce voltage signals, which were subsequently used to extract energy through amplitude. The 3D tracks are also reconstructed based on drift time differences and Breadth First search.
To enhance signal background separation, six topological variables were extracted from the reconstructed tracks and used to define optimized selection criteria. The Boosted Decision Trees is used for a preliminary analysis. This simulation framework serves as a crucial tool for design optimization and sensitivity studies in the N$\nu$DEx experiment.
