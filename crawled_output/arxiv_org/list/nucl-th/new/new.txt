Title:
Equation of state for hyperonic neutron-star matter in SU(3) flavor symmetry

Using a relativistic mean-field model calibrated to finite-nucleus observables and bulk properties of dense nuclear matter, we investigate hyperonic neutron-star matter within an SU(3) flavor-symmetry scheme. To retain SU(6)-based couplings within SU(3) flavor symmetry, we add a quartic $\phi$ self-interaction and $\phi$-$\rho$ mixing. We demonstrate the roles of $\alpha_{v}$ ($F/(F+D)$ ratio), $\theta_{v}$ (mixing angle), and $z_{v}$ (singlet-to-octet coupling ratio) in SU(3)-invariant vector-meson couplings. It is found that $z_{v}$ predominantly controls the maximum mass of a neutron star, and $2M_{\odot}$ neutron stars can be supported for $z_{v}\le0.15$. The $\alpha_{v}$ also helps sustain large masses, whereas $\theta_{v}$ has a smaller effect on neutron-star properties. This SU(3) framework reconciles nuclear and astrophysical constraints, and offers a plausible resolution to the hyperon puzzle.

The neutrinoless double-$\beta$ decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$) of nuclei is one of the major research subjects of neutrino physics nowadays because of its influence on particle physics and astrophysics. The predicted nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) of the $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay have a large uncertainty depending on the models used to calculate them. This problem has affected the development of neutrino physics for many years. We have performed, recently, the calculation of the NMEs for the $0\nu\beta\beta$ and two-neutrino double-$\beta$ decay ($2\nu\beta\beta$) modes with a perturbed transition operator and found that the effective axial-vector current coupling ($g_A^\mathrm{eff}$) is similar for these two decay modes. Based on this finding, we calculate the $0\nu\beta\beta$ NMEs using the phenomenological $g_A^\mathrm{eff}$ that reproduces the measured half-life of the $2\nu\beta\beta$ decay. We apply this method to the NMEs for $^{136}$Xe obtained by several groups and show that the uncertainty of the $0\nu\beta\beta$ NME is dramatically reduced. Owing to this finding, we calculate the effective neutrino mass, consistent with the current experimental lower limit of the half-life for the $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay, and the results indicate that this effective neutrino mass value does not yet reach the inverted mass hierarchy region allowed by the neutrino oscillation data and the lightest neutrino mass assumed to be smaller than 10 meV.

Subtracted second Tamm-Dancoff approximation in the relativistic point-coupling model

Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)
Theoretical description of collective nuclear excitations and astrophysically relevant processes require methods going beyond the Random Phase Approximation (RPA) or Tamm-Dancoff Approximation (TDA), which are limited to one-particle-one-hole (1p-1h) configurations. In this work, we introduce the Second Tamm-Dancoff Approximation (STDA) based on the relativistic nuclear energy density functional, which also incorporates two-particle-two-hole (2p-2h) configurations, providing a more comprehensive description of nuclear excitations. Within the relativistic STDA (RSTDA), we implement the subtraction method, that is essential to avoid double counting of correlations and provide realistic description of excited states. Using the DD-PC1 parametrization of the relativistic point-coupling interaction, in the first application of the RSTDA we investigate the properties of isoscalar monopole and quadrupole transitions in 16O. The analysis reveals important role of complex configurations on centroid energies, transition strength distributions, and the fine structure of nuclear response. By resolving the fragmentation and spreading of excitation strength, the RSTDA enables accurate description of experimental spectra.

Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)
We have studied single-$\Lambda$ finite hypernuclear systems spanning from light to heavy masses, employing a new microscopic Lambda-N interaction derived from in-medium interactions within relativistic Brueckner-Hartree-Fock calculations using the leading-order covariant chiral hyperon-nucleon force. Without any adjustable parameters, we have successfully reproduced the experimental results for the single-Lambda binding energies. Although some discrepancies persist in light hypernuclei, the overall calculated binding energies show excellent agreement with the experimental data, and outperforming other microscopic interactions. This study further demonstrates the validity of the leading-order covariant chiral hyperon-nucleon potential and provides a practical set of microscopic interactions for the Skyrme-Hartree-Fock framework.

Title:
A practical approach to perturbative corrections to few-body observables
Sourav Mondal, Martin Schäfer, Mirko Bagnarol, Nir Barnea, Udit Raha, Johannes Kirscher
Subjects:
Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)
We formulate two methods to facilitate the calculation of perturbative corrections to quantum few-body observables. Both techniques are designed for a numerical realization in combination with any tool that obtains either the entire spectrum or solely the eigenvalues of an operator corresponding to the observable of interest. We exemplify these methods in the context of the nuclear contact theory without pions (Pionless EFT) and benchmark them in the deuteron channel with available analytical, field-theoretical calculations, as well as in the triton and 3-helium channels through earlier extractions within the dibaryon formalism, where in all three systems the point-proton root-mean-square charge radius (rms) was the perturbed observable of choice. Beyond these $A\leq3$ consistency and accuracy checks, we employ the numerical methods to predict the rms of the 4-helium nuclear ground state to assess three different ways of integrating the Coulomb interaction into Pionless EFT. By comparing the respective results at leading and next-to-leading order for 3- and 4-helium, we find that the uncertainty due to the strong, short-range interaction is significantly larger compared with that due to the long-range Coulomb interaction for both bound states with their different binding momenta. Thereby, we provide strong support for simplifying extractions of bound-state observables by shutting off any Coulomb interaction if the strong part of the potential is considered only up to first order in the effective range expansion.

An important question in heavy-ion collisions is how the initial far-from-equilibrium medium evolves and thermalizes while it undergoes a rapid longitudinal expansion. In this presentation, we show how to use the two-particle irreducible (2PI) effective action to address this question, focusing on $\phi^4$ scalar theory truncated at three loops. We present numerical results for quantities such as the occupation number, the thermal mass, and the number density.

The hyper-radial barrier strongly hinders formation of more than three clusters. We investigate how well the dominating cluster components in $^7$He and $^8$He, respectively can be described as $\alpha$+$n$+$^2n$ and $\alpha$+$^2n$+$^2n$, where $^2n$ is the dineutron. Effective interactions compatible with $^5$He and $^6$He are used. We vary the lesser known $n$-$^2n$ and $^2n$-$^2n$ interactions, where very small strengths are required. We provide energies, radii, and partial wave decomposition of all computed, predicted or measured, ground and resonance states. We predict substructures within each of the three-body quantum states. We also calculate the neutron-structure sensitive invariant mass spectrum of the four-nucleon system, after fast removal of the $\alpha$-particle from $^8$He. We show that all available experimental information are fairly well reproduced. Very little room is left for variation of the effective interaction parameters. Thus, the dominating features of the subsequently derived reaction and structure properties are well supported.

Anomalous Correction to Dynamical Response of Relativistic Plasma in a Magnetic Field

We study collective excitations in a relativistic collisionless plasma composed of massless fermions subject to an external magnetic field. We include dynamical electromagnetism and fluctuations of the chiral charge, while maintaining a vanishing net chiral charge. Within the framework of chiral kinetic theory, we find that the chiral anomaly gives a correction to the dispersion relation of the transverse mode. In a strong magnetic field, we also show that the collective mode has a gap using the lowest Landau level approximation. We discuss the anomalous correction in the context of neutron star phenomenology.

Quantum Late-Time Decay and Channel Dependence

Quantum mechanics predicts deviations from exponential decay at short and long times, yet experimental evidence is limited. We report a power-law tail after $\sim$10 lifetimes in erythrosine~B fluorescence, confirmed by two detectors probing distinct bands but yielding different power coefficients. The data match a divergent but normalizable spectral density, and theory predicts oscillations as a future test. A novel and general result is that in multichannel QM (and QFT) decay the lifetime is universal, but the late-time deviations exhibit a sizeable time window in which they are channel (or band) dependent, a feature consistent with our data.

Electromagnetic structure of axial-vector mesons and implications for the muon $g-2$

High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)
The electromagnetic structure of axial-vector mesons is investigated via elastic and two-photon transition form factors (TFFs). To this end, we employ a framework based on the Dyson-Schwinger and Bethe-Salpeter equations within a contact interaction model. This largely algebraic approach transparently exposes the role of symmetries and their breaking, and has proven successful in describing anomaly-sensitive processes, including pseudoscalar to two-photon TFFs, $\gamma \to 3 \pi$, and vector-to-pseudoscalar radiative decays. Restricting our analysis to the lowest-lying states, $\text{A}=\{ a_1, f_1,f_1'\}$, we also evaluate the corresponding light-by-light contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment, and obtain $a_\mu^{\text{A}}=11.30(4.71)\times10^{-11}$, consistent with contemporary estimates.

High-accuracy calculations of electric dipole polarizabilities and quadrupole moments ($\Theta$) of the clock states of the singly charged calcium (Ca$^+$), strontium (Sr$^+$) and barium (Ba$^+$) alkaline-earth ions are estimated by employing relativistic coupled-cluster (RCC) theory. It demonstrates importance of the triple excitations in the RCC method for precise determination of the above quantities. We also observe a different trend of correlations in the $\Theta$ values than an earlier study with respect to orbitals from higher angular momenta. Reliability of the results is verified by comparing the calculated energies, magnetic dipole hyperfine structure constants, and lifetimes of the atomic states with the experimental values of the $^{43}$Ca$^+$, $^{87}$Sr$^+$ and $^{137}$Ba$^+$ ions. Nuclear quadrupole moments of these isotopes are also estimated by combining calculations with the measured electric quadrupole hyperfine structure constants, showing large deviations from the literature values.

Subjects:

We consider the thermodynamic properties of a rotating gas of fermions. We begin by constructing the thermodynamic potential $\Phi$ and its associated current $\phi^\mu$ within the grand canonical ensemble of a macroscopic rigidly rotating body, where the ensemble parameters are the temperature $T_0$ and chemical potential $\mu_0$ on the rotation axis, as well as the rotation angular velocity $\Omega_0$. We then consider the problem of local thermodynamics, where the thermodynamic state is defined by the local temperature $T$ and chemical potential $\mu$, as well as the local spin potential tensor, $\Omega_{\mu\nu}$. We find the thermodynamic pressure $P$, given as the sum of the usual classical (non-quantum) pressure and other corrections due to the spin potential and the kinematic state of the fluid. We compute the associated entropy, charge and spin densities, and show they are consistent with the Euler relation.

Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)
The properties of bound states are fundamental to hadronic spectroscopy and play a central role in the transition from hadronic matter to a quark-gluon plasma (QGP). In a strongly coupled QGP (sQGP), the interplay of temperature, binding energy and large collisional widths of the partons poses formidable challenges in evaluating the in-medium properties of hadronic states and their eventual melting. In particular, the existence of heavy quarkonia in the QGP is a long-standing problem that is hard to solve by considering their spectral properties on the real-energy axis. We address this problem by analyzing in-medium thermodynamic quarkonium $T$-matrices in the complex energy plane. We first validate this method in vacuum, where the $T$-matrix poles of observed states are readily identified. When deploying this approach to recent self-consistently calculated $T$-matrices in the QGP, we find that poles in the complex energy plane can persist to surprisingly large temperatures, depending on the strength of the in-medium interactions. While the masses and widths of the pole positions are precisely defined, the notion of a binding energy is not due to the absence of thresholds caused by the (large) widths of the underlying anti-/quark spectral functions. Our method thus provides a new and definitive quantum-mechanical criterion to determine the melting temperature of hadronic states in the sQGP while increasing the accuracy in the theoretical determination of transport parameters.

In the present work, we have done a systematic study of beta decay properties such as electron spectral-shapes, shape factors, and log$ft$ values for the higher forbidden non-unique $\beta^{-}$ transitions in the mass region A=85-123. We have performed the nuclear shell model (SM) calculations to explore the sensitivity of the electron spectral-shapes for different axial-vector coupling constants $g_{A}=0.8-1.27$. The effective interactions GWBXG, G-matrix, SNET and SN100PN are used for different model spaces. In the present work, we have computed the electron spectral-shapes of $^{85}$Br, $^{87}$Rb, $^{93}$Zr, $^{97}$Zr, $^{101}$Mo, $^{115}$Cd, $^{117}$Cd, $^{119}$In, $^{123}$Sn and $^{135}$Cs by constraining the small relativistic nuclear matrix element from conserved vector-current hypothesis (CVC). We have found that the electron spectral-shapes are strongly dependent on $g_{A}$ except the second forbidden non-unique $\beta^{-}$ transition $^{93}$Zr.

In this work, we study the charged hadron anisotropic flow coefficients $v_n$ (up to $n = 12$) using high-statistics event-by-event simulations of Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}} = 5.02$ and $5.36$~TeV, employing the IP-Glasma + MUSIC + UrQMD hybrid approach. The power spectra of anisotropic flow coefficients ($v_n\{2\}$ vs. $n$) are compared with the ALICE measurements from central to 50% centrality. To understand the various sources contributing to the high-order $v_n$ coefficients, we analyze the nonlinear mode coefficients for high-order anisotropic flow coefficients using different approximations and make comparisons with available measurements.

We employ a model of nuclear structure that takes into account the quark substructure of the baryons to understand the behavior of static two-point correlation functions of meson fields in dense nuclear matter. We show that these correlation functions display ``moat'' regimes, where the inverse static correlation function is nonmonotonic in momentum space. This can have interesting consequences for the nature of nuclear matter, and it strengthens the possibility of a liquid-crystal phase for high densities.

Deuterons with different polarization states have distinct shapes for their wavefunctions. This offers a unique opportunity to experimentally control the initial-state collision geometry with the polarization of the light-ion targets in relativistic heavy-ion experiments. We study the charged hadron elliptic flow coefficients with respect to the polarization angle of deuterons in Pb + polarized deuteron collisions using a hydrodynamics + hadronic transport model. Hydrodynamic response to initial-state geometry predicts a distinct sign of $v_2$ correlated with the deuteron's polarization states, providing a clean test case for elucidating the collective origin in small collision systems.

Analyzing the transport coefficients and observables of a rotating QGP medium in kinetic theory framework with a novel approach to the collision integral

Subjects:

In the present work, we have studied how the rotation of the QGP medium affects the transport coefficients and observables in heavy ion collisions. For the noncentral collisions, although most of the angular momentum gets carried away by the spectators, there still remains a finite angular momentum with a finite range of angular velocity, which thus incites rotation in the produced matter. As a result, various properties of the QGP medium including its transport properties are most likely to be modulated by the rotation. We have calculated the transport coefficients and observables, such as the electrical conductivity, the thermal conductivity, the Knudsen number, the elliptic flow, the specific heat at constant pressure, the specific heat at constant volume, the trace anomaly, the thermal diffusion constant and the isothermal compressibility using the kinetic theory to see the effect of rotation on them. In particular, we have used the novel relaxation time approximation for the collision integral in the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation to derive the transport coefficients and compared them with their values in the relaxation time approximation within the kinetic theory approach in conjunction with the finite angular velocity. We have found that the emergence of angular velocity enhances the flow of charge and heat in the medium. Further, as compared to the relaxation time approximation, the electrical and the thermal conductivities have smaller values in the novel relaxation time approximation and these differences between the conductivities in the said approximations are more pronounced at high temperatures than at low temperatures. Furthermore, all the aforesaid observables are found to be sensitive to the rotation of the QGP medium.

We introduce the Sequency Hierarchy Truncation (SeqHT) scheme for reducing the resources required for state preparation and time evolution in quantum simulations, based upon a truncation in sequency. For the $\lambda\phi^4$ interaction in scalar field theory, or any interaction with a polynomial expansion, upper bounds on the contributions of operators of a given sequency are derived. For the systems we have examined, observables computed in sequency-truncated wavefunctions, including quantum correlations as measured by magic, are found to step-wise converge to their exact values with increasing cutoff sequency. The utility of SeqHT is demonstrated in the adiabatic state preparation of the $\lambda\phi^4$ anharmonic oscillator ground state using IBM's quantum computer ${\textit ibm\_sherbrooke}$. Using SeqHT, the depth of the required quantum circuits is reduced by $\sim 30\%$, leading to significantly improved determinations of observables in the quantum simulations. More generally, SeqHT is expected to lead to a reduction in required resources for quantum simulations of systems with a hierarchy of length scales.

A direct measurement of the ground-state-to-ground-state electron-capture decay $Q$ ($Q_{\rm EC}$) value of $^{97}$Tc has been conducted employing the high resolving power phase-imaging ion-cyclotron-resonance technique with the double Penning trap mass spectrometer JYFLTRAP. The resulting $Q_{\rm EC}$ value for $^{97}$Tc is 324.82(21) keV, exhibiting a precision approximately 19 times higher than the value adopted in the newest Atomic Mass Evaluation (AME2020) and differing by 1.2$\sigma$. Furthermore, by combining this refined $Q$ value with nuclear energy-level data for the decay-daughter $^{97}$Mo, a potential ultra-low Q-value transition, possibly of allowed type, $^{97}$Tc (9/2$^{+}$, ground state) $\rightarrow$ $^{97}$Mo$^{*}$ (320(1) keV), was evaluated for future long-term neutrino-mass determination experiments. The ground-state-to-excited-state electron-capture decay $Q$ value ($Q^{*}_{\rm EC}$) of this transition was determined to be 4.8(10) keV, confirming it to be energetically allowed with a confidence level of exceeding 4$\sigma$. The captures of electrons occupying the L and higher shells for this transition are energetically allowed, giving a value of 2.0(10) keV for the closest distance of $Q^{*}_{\rm EC}$ to the allowed binding energy of the L1 shell. To predict partial half-lives and energy-release distributions for this transition, the atomic self-consistent many-electron Dirac--Hartree--Fock--Slater method and the nuclear shell model have been employed. Dominant correction terms such as exchange and overlap corrections, as well as shake-up and shake-off effects, were included in the final results. Moreover, the normalized distribution of released energy in the electron-capture decay of $^{97}$Tc to excited states of $^{97}$Mo, is compared with that of $^{163}$Ho, which is being used for electron-neutrino-mass determination.

We propose first-principle calculations of an open system based on the real-time path integral formalism treating the environment as well as the system of our interest together on a computer. The sign problem that occurs in applying Monte Carlo methods can be overcome in general by using the so-called Lefschetz thimble method, which has been developed over the past decade. Here we focus on the Caldeira-Leggett model, which is well known, in particular, as a model of quantum decoherence. In this case, the calculation simplifies drastically since the path integral becomes Gaussian for typical initial conditions. The relevant saddle point, which is unique and complex, can be determined by solving a linear equation with a huge but sparse coefficient matrix, and the integration over the Lefschetz thimble can be performed analytically. Thus we obtain, without assumptions or approximations, the reduced density matrix after a long-time evolution, tracing out a large number of harmonic oscillators in the environment. In particular, we confirm the dependence of the decoherence time on the coupling constant and the temperature that has been predicted from the master equation in a certain parameter regime.

We perform the first quantum computation of parton distribution function (PDF) with a real quantum device by calculating the PDF of the lightest positronium in the Schwinger model with IBM quantum computers. The calculation uses 10 qubits for staggered fermions at five spatial sites and one ancillary qubit. The most critical and challenging step is to reduce the number of two-qubit gate depths to around 500 so that sensible results start to emerge. The resulting lightcone correlators have excellent agreement with the classical simulator result in central values, although the error is still large. Compared with classical approaches, quantum computation has the advantage of not being limited in the accessible range of parton momentum fraction $x$ due to renormalon ambiguity, and the difficulty of accessing non-valence partons. A PDF calculation with 3+1 dimensional QCD near $x=0$ or $x=1$ will be a clear demonstration of the quantum advantage on a problem with great scientific impact.

The fact that strange sea quarks are abundant in the nucleons, but with zero net strangeness, is of great importance for understanding the nature of matter condensed by the strong interaction, particularly in the context of the ``gigantic nucleus'' formed by the gravitational collapse of an evolved massive star. We hypothesize that the basic unit of bulk strong matter with the light-flavor symmetry of valence quarks is ``strangeon'', which is the counterpart of the nucleon found in atomic nuclei. In addition to strangeon stars (SnSs) with large baryon number of $A\approx 10^{57}$, strange nuggets (SnNs) with $A\gtrsim 10^{10}$ could also exist in the Universe. Both the SnS and the SnN are explained, with attention to their observational evidence.

A hallmark of the computational campaign in nuclear and particle physics is the lattice-gauge-theory program. It continues to enable theoretical predictions for a range of phenomena in nature from the underlying Standard Model. The emergence of a new computational paradigm based on quantum computing, therefore, can introduce further advances in this program. In particular, it is believed that quantum computing will make possible first-principles studies of matter at extreme densities, and in and out of equilibrium, hence improving our theoretical description of early universe, astrophysical environments, and high-energy particle collisions. Developing and advancing a quantum-computing based lattice-gauge-theory program, therefore, is a vibrant and fast-moving area of research in theoretical nuclear and particle physics.
These lecture notes introduce the topic of quantum computing lattice gauge theories in a pedagogical manner, with an emphasis on theoretical and algorithmic aspects of the program, and on the most common approaches and practices, to keep the presentation focused and useful. Hamiltonian formulation of lattice gauge theories is introduced within the Kogut-Susskind framework, the notion of Hilbert space and physical states is discussed, and some elementary numerical methods for performing Hamiltonian simulations are discussed. Quantum-simulation preliminaries and digital quantum-computing basics are presented, which set the stage for concrete examples of gauge-theory quantum-circuit design and resource analysis. A step-by-step analysis is provided for a simpler Abelian gauge theory, and an overview of our current understanding of the quantum-computing cost of quantum chromodynamics is presented in the end. Examples and exercises augment the material, and reinforce the concepts and methods introduced throughout.

Title:
On the High Excitation 7$α$ De-exciting States in $^{28}$Si$^*$

Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)
A direct comparison and analysis of published spectra for the 7$\alpha$ disassembly of $^{28}$Si projectiles excited in collisions with $^{12}$C at 35 MeV/u reveals significant agreement in the derived excitation energies of high excitation energy resonances observed in two different experiments, in contrast to some earlier conclusions reported in the literature. Many of the observed resonances have excitation energies consistent with those arrived at in recent theoretical investigations explicitly predicting the excitation energies and spins of toroidal nuclei. An AI-assisted application of well-established statistical filtering techniques reveals identical structures in all spectra investigated. Some additional peaks are observed. The possibility that they correspond to other favored geometries is discussed.

Title:
Dispersion relations of deeply virtual Compton scattering: investigating twist-4 kinematic power corrections

In this paper we include kinematic power corrections up to twist-four to the deeply virtual Compton scattering dispersion relation. We demonstrate that, both for (pseudo-)scalar and spin-$1/2$ targets, the formal expression of the $n$-subtracted leading-twist dispersion relations is preserved. However, the expression of the subtracted constants is modified by the kinematic powers. Importantly, the minimal-subtracted dispersion relation for the helicity-conserving amplitude, previously thought to depend only on the Polyakov-Weiss $D$-term, now also depends on the double distributions $F$ and $K$. These results are consistent with the ones obtained previously in the literature. Such a mixing may be critical for the Jefferson Lab kinematic range, as it is not suppressed for typical values of $t$ and $Q^{2}$ in the valence region. We therefore expect a strong impact on attempts to extract pressure forces from DVCS data.

Title:
$A_β[E_β]$ in $^{37}$K decay: new physics with opposite $β$ helicity

By extending our analysis and simulations of our $^{37}$K $\beta$-decay data set to allow the $\beta$ asymmetry with respect to nuclear spin to vary with $\beta$ energy $E_{\beta}$, we have gained sensitivity to new physics that depends on a helicity factor for the $\beta$, $m_\beta/E_\beta$.
In particular, we constrain Lorentz scalar and tensor quark-lepton interaction strengths at a sensitivity complementary to the similar Fierz interference term in neutron $\beta$ decay.
Our result for that new physics is
$b_F$ = -0.0002 $\pm$ 0.024 (stat) $\pm$ 0.039 (syst),
consistent with the standard model electroweak interaction value $b_F=0$. We consider presently achieved complementarity to $\beta$-decay and particle physics experiments, along with projectable technical improvements to our method.
