Title:
Charm quark evolution in the early stages of heavy-ion collisions

Heavy quarks are predominantly generated at the initial stage of relativistic heavy-ion collisions such that heavy flavor observables have the potential to provide information on the pre-equilibrium medium dynamics. In this study, we investigate the sensitivity of D-meson $R_{AA}$ and $v_2$ to early-time charm quark dynamics in Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02$ TeV. We employ the IP-Glasma+MUSIC+UrQMD framework to model the evolution of the bulk medium. Charm quarks are generated using PYTHIA with nuclear parton distribution functions and evolved using Langevin dynamics within MARTINI. We observe that even though there is significant momentum broadening in the earliest stage, D-meson $R_{AA}$ and $v_2$ are only weakly sensitive to pre-equilibrium interactions.

Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)
The neutron-proton-electron (npe) matter under strong magnetic field is studied in the context of the covariant Vlasov approach. A covariant relativistic approach based on the Vlasov equation is applied to the study of infinite asymmetric magnetized nuclear matter. We use several relativistic mean-field nuclear models with non-linear terms. The dispersion relations for the longitudinal modes are obtained, and the isovector and isoscalar collective modes are determined in a wide range of densities as a function of the isospin asymmetry, momentum transfer, and magnetic field. A strong magnetic field gives rise to the appearance of low-lying isovector modes that propagate in nuclear matter, not present in non-magnetized matter. Neutron-like modes are essentially not affected by the presence of a strong magnetic field. In the presence of a strong magnetic field, Landau quantization modifies the proton-like collective modes, leading to the emergence of new branches associated with distinct Landau levels. These new modes can propagate even at high densities and exhibit isoscalar or isovector character. While neutron-like isoscalar modes at high density are insensitive to the presence of a magnetic field.

The role of spin degrees of freedom in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) has attracted significant interest in recent years. Spin hydrodynamics extends conventional hydrodynamics by incorporating spin via the spin tensor. In the mean-field limit of the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model under rigid rotation, spin degrees of freedom manifest naturally as axial-vector, or spin, condensate. We investigate the interplay between chiral and spin condensates in this framework. While rotation typically suppresses the formation of a chiral condensate, the presence of a spin condensate may counteract this effect, enhancing the chiral condensate. Moreover, it can alter the nature of the chiral transition from second to first order.

Stochastic Mean-Field Theory and Applications to Multinucleon Transfer and Kinetic Energy Dissipation Processes in Heavy-Ion Collisions

Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)
In this Review article, a brief description of the stochastic mean-field theory (SMF) for describing reaction dynamics in low-energy heavy-ion collisions at bombarding energies in the vicinity of the Coulomb barrier is presented. In these collisions, as a result of strong Pauli blocking, binary nucleon collisions do not have a significant effect on the dissipation and fluctuations. At low energies, the mean-field fluctuations, due to initial correlations, have a dominant effect on fluctuations of macroscopic variables. The SMF theory proposes the determination of an ensemble of single-particle density matrices by specifying random initial fluctuations according to a distribution law. Employing an ensemble of single-particle density matrices, not only the mean values but also the distribution functions of the one-body observables can be determined. If the di-nuclear structure is maintained in heavy-ion collisions, such as deep inelastic collisions and fast quasi-fission reactions, a much simpler description of the reaction mechanism can be derived in terms of several macroscopic variables such as mass and charge asymmetry, and relative linear and relative angular momentum. In this case, by geometric projection of the SMF equations, it is possible to derive the quantal Langevin equations for macroscopic variables. As an application of quantal transport description, an analysis of multinucleon transfers and kinetic energy dissipation and fluctuations is presented for selected quasi-fission reactions.

Subjects:
Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)
Fine-tuning of the binding energies and widths of the quasi-bound states in three-body systems consisting of antikaon(s) and nucleon(s) was performed. Dynamically exact three-body Faddeev-type AGS equations with three coupled particle channels were solved for the description of the $\bar{K}NN$ and $\bar{K} \bar{K} N$ systems in different spin states. New models of the antikaon-nucleon and pion-nucleon interactions were constructed, and together with our best versions for the remaining potentials were used as input. The characteristics of the quasi-bound $K^- pp$ state calculated with our new one-pole $\bar{K}N - \pi \Sigma - \pi \Lambda$ potential reproduces the experimental data from the E15 J-PARC experiment.

Title:
Improved initial colliding nuclei density profile method for QMD-type transport models
Xilong Xiang, Pengcheng Li, Manzi Nan, Yongjia Wang, Ling Liu, Qingfeng Li
Subjects:
Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)
Accurate modeling of the initial density profile is essential for studying heavy-ion collisions with transport models. Within the framework of the quantum molecular dynamics (QMD)-type model, a novel method for generating nuclear density distributions based on a Fourier series expansion (FSE) is proposed. In this approach, the objective density distribution is expanded into a Fourier series to construct a filter function, which is then applied to select the randomly sampled nucleon coordinates in phase space to generate a three-dimensional nuclear density distribution that matches the desired profile. Using this FSE-based filtering method, and together with the conventional Woods-Saxon (WS) filtering scheme for comparison, the $^{96}$Ru+$^{96}$Ru collisions are simulated by using the ultra-relativistic quantum molecular dynamics (UrQMD) model. It is found that the FSE method not only reproduces the objective density distribution with high fidelity but also maintains good stability. Furthermore, collective flows of free protons obtained with the FSE initialization provide a significantly improved description of experimental data compared with the WS approach. These results indicate that the FSE method can be integrated into microscopic transport models, offering theoretical support for exploring nuclear structure through HICs.

Title:
A Quantum Computational Determination of the Weak Mixing Angle in the Standard Model

The weak mixing angle $s_W$ is a fundamental constant in the Standard Model (SM) and measured at the $Z$ boson mass to be $\widehat{s}^2_W(m_Z) = 0.23129 \pm 0.00004$ in the $\overline{\rm MS}$ renormalization scheme, where $m_Z=91.2\ \text{GeV}$. On the other hand, non-stabilizerness - the magic - characterizes the computational advantage of a quantum system over classical computers. We consider the production of magic from stabilizer initial states, which carry zero magic, in the 2-to-2 scattering of charged leptons in the SM at the tree level, which is mediated by the photon and the $Z$ boson. Using the second order stabilizer Rényi entropy, and averaging over all 60 initial stabilizer states and the scattering angle, we compute and minimize the magic production as a function of $s^2_W$ in the Møller scattering $e^-e^-\to e^-e^-$, which is free of kinematic thresholds. At the centre-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s}=m_Z$, there is a unique minimum in magic production at $\mathbf{s}^{2}_W(m_Z)=0.2317$, which agrees with the measured $\widehat{s}^2_W(m_Z)$ at the sub-percent level. At higher energies, the magic-minimizing $\mathbf{s}^{2}_W$ continues to agree with the empirical value at the percent level or better, up to 10 TeV. The finding suggests the electroweak sector of the SM tends to generate minimal quantum resources from the computational viewpoint.

Title:
Probing Quark Electromagnetic Properties via Entangled Quark Pairs in Fragmentation Hadrons at Lepton Colliders

Electromagnetic dipole interactions of light quarks induce distinct spin correlations in quark pairs produced at lepton colliders, favoring entangled spin-triplet state aligned along the $\hat{z}$ axis or spin-singlet state. These correlations lead to unique $\cos(\phi_1-\phi_2)$ azimuthal asymmetries in inclusive $\pi^+\pi^-$-dihadron pair production and in back-to-back hadron pairs ($\pi\pi,K\pi,KK$), which are absent in the SM. By analyzing Belle and BaBar data and using ratios of azimuthal asymmetries, we demonstrate that these measurements provide robust and significant constraints on light-quark dipole couplings, insensitive to nonperturbative fragmentation functions and free from contamination by other new physics effects. This approach offers a clean and novel probe of light-quark dipole interactions in collider experiments.

Global Deep Neural Network Modeling of Compton Form Factors Constrained from Local $χ^2$ Maps Fits
L. Calero Diaz, D. Keller
Subjects:
Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)
Over the past two decades, intense experimental efforts have focused on measuring observables that contribute to a three-dimensional description of the nucleon. Generalized Parton Distributions provide complementary insights into the internal structure and dynamics of hadrons, including information about the orbital angular momentum carried by quarks. The most direct process to access these distributions is Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering, in which the cross section can be expressed in terms of Compton Form Factors. These quantities are defined as convolutions of the Generalized Parton Distributions with coefficient functions derived in perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics. We extract the Compton Form Factors from Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering data collected at Jefferson Lab, including the most recent measurements in Hall A, using a novel local fitting technique based on $\chi^2$ mapping to constrain the real parts of the Compton Form Factors $\mathcal{H}, \mathcal{E}$ and $\widetilde{\mathcal{H}}$. They are determined independently in each kinematic bin for the unpolarized beam-target configuration under the twist-2 approximation, following the formalism developed by Belitsky, Müller, and Kirchner. The extracted Compton Form Factors are then used to train and regularize a deep neural network, enabling a global determination of their behavior with minimal model dependence. This procedure is validated and systematically studied using pseudodata generated with kinematics matching those of the experimental measurements.

Listening to the long ringdown: A novel way to pinpoint the EOS in neutron-star cores

Gravitational waves (GWs) from binary neutron star (BNS) merger remnants complement constraints from the inspiral phase, mass-radius measurements, and microscopic theory by providing information about the neutron-star equation of state (EOS) at extreme densities. We perform general-relativistic simulations of BNS mergers using EOS models that span the uncertain high-density regime. We find a robust correlation between the ratio of energy and angular momentum lost during the late-time post-merger GW signal - the long ringdown - and the EOS at the highest densities in neutron star cores. Applying this correlation to post-merger GW signals reduces EOS uncertainty at several times saturation density, where no direct constraints currently exist.

The gradients act as invisible engines of transport, converting microscopic imbalances into macroscopic flows, and thus providing deep insights into the dynamics of physical systems. Thermal gradients do not merely drive the flow of heat, but they also set the microscopic constituents of the system into motion. In such scenarios, the constituents of the system not only transport energy but also diffuse collectively under the influence of these gradients. For the very first time, we present a first-principles investigation of the Soret and Dufour effects in hot and dense quantum chromodynamics (QCD) matter. We use the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation under the relaxation time approximation. By incorporating chemical potential and temperature gradients into the kinetic theory framework, we derive explicit expressions for the Dufour coefficient, which quantifies the heat flow due to concentration gradients, and the Soret coefficient, which describes the particle diffusion induced by thermal gradients. These coupled-transport phenomena are traditionally studied in multi-component classical systems at low energy scales. In this study, we follow quasiparticle models for the deconfined phase and the hadron resonance gas model for the confined hadronic phase in the context of heavy-ion collisions. This study provides novel insights into the thermo-diffusion and diffusion-thermo phenomena and opens avenues for incorporating such effects in hydrodynamic modeling and transport simulations of QCD matter.

r-process nucleosynthesis with ab initio nuclear masses around the N=82 shell closure

Our understanding of the origin of heavy elements beyond iron relies on the rapid neutron capture process (r-process), which accounts for roughly half of their cosmic abundance. However, the extreme neutron-rich conditions required for the r-process involve many nuclei that remain experimentally inaccessible, making theoretical predictions essential. We explore the impact of nuclear masses calculated with the ab initio valence-space in-medium similarity renormalization group, focusing on the region around the N = 82 shell closure. We show that such ab initio mass calculations can refine the r-process predictions compared to global, but more phenomenological mass models. With the ab initio masses, the waiting point of the second r-process peak is strengthened, which leads to an overall slower nucleosynthesis flow, lower abundances of nuclei beyond the peak, and a stronger shift of the third r-process peak.

Observing $\eta'$-nuclear quasibound states requires that the $\eta'$-nuclear potential is both sufficiently attractive and weakly absorptive, as confirmed by the CBELSA/TAPS collaboration analysis of inclusive $\eta'$ production experiments on nuclear targets, including liquid hydrogen (LH$_2$). Here we present an alternative derivation of the $\eta'$-nuclear potential, constrained by near-threshold $pp\to pp\eta'$ and $\gamma p\to\eta' p$ production experiments on a free proton. The resulting $\eta'$-nuclear potential is weakly attractive and strongly absorptive, to the extent that observation of clear signals of $\eta'$-nuclear quasibound states is unlikely. Possible exceptions resulting from the dynamics of the nearby $I=\frac{1}{2}$ $J=({\frac{1}{2}})^-$ nucleon resonance $N^{\ast}$(1895) are briefly discussed.

We study point impurities in non-relativistic quantum field theories, with a focus on scale-invariant fixed points. We establish the framework of conformal defects in Schrödinger field theories and their correspondence to many-body states in a harmonic trap. We discuss a multi-critical quantization of the one-body wave function induced by an impurity, with examples of free and unitary Fermi gases. Our results can potentially be tested in experimental setups.

Statistical analysis of pQCD energy loss across system size, flavor, $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$, and $p_T$

We present suppression predictions from our pQCD-based energy loss model, which receives small system size corrections, for high-$p_T$ $\pi$, $D$ and $B$ meson $R_{AB}$ as a function of centrality, flavor, $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$, and $p_T$ from large to small collision systems at RHIC and LHC. A statistical analysis is used to constrain the effective strong coupling in our model to available high-$p_T$ suppression data from central heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and LHC, yielding good agreement with all available data. We estimate two important theoretical uncertainties in our model, stemming from: the transition between vacuum and hard thermal loop propagators in the collisional energy loss, and from the angular cutoff on the radiated gluon momentum. We find, consistently, that the extracted $\alpha_s$ remains relatively unchanged across heavy- and light-flavor final states and across central, semi-central, and peripheral collisions. We make predictions from our large-system-constrained model for small systems and find good agreement with photon-normalized $R^{\pi^0}_{d \text{Au}} \simeq 0.75 $ in $0-5\%$ centrality $d$ + Au collisions by PHENIX. However, we find strong disagreement with the measured $R^{h^{\pm}}_{p \text{Pb}} \gtrsim 1$ in $0-5\%$ centrality $p$ + Pb collisions by ALICE and ATLAS; we argue that this disagreement is due, in large part, to centrality bias. We make predictions for the ratio of suppression in ${}^3$He + Au and $p$ + Au collisions, which may in the future be used to disentangle final- from initial-state suppression in small systems. We then compare our results to various subsets of data, which allows us to estimate the preferred: low-$p_T$ scale at which non-perturbative processes become important, scales at which the strong coupling runs, and scale at which vacuum propagators transition to thermally modified propagators in collisional energy loss.

Thermal relaxation and the complete set of second order transport coefficients for the unitary Fermi gas from kinetic theory
Christian Hall, Thomas Schaefer
Comments:
34 pages, no figures. Minor revisions. To appear in Phys. Rev. A
Subjects:
Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)
We compute the complete set of second order transport coefficients of the unitary Fermi gas, a dilute gas of spin 1/2 particles interacting via an $s$-wave interaction tuned to infinite scattering length. The calculation is based on kinetic theory and the Chapman-Enskog method at second order in the Knudsen expansion. We take into account the exact two-body collision integral. We extend previous results on second order coefficients related to shear stress by including terms related to heat flow and gradients of the fugacity. We confirm that the thermal relaxation time is given by the simple estimate $\tau_\kappa = \kappa m/(c_PT)$ even if the full collision kernel is taken into account. Here, $\kappa$ is the thermal conductivity, $m$ is the mass of the particles, $c_P$ is the specific heat at constant pressure, and $T$ is the temperature.

We establish the connection between thermodynamic and dynamical instabilities in relativistic hydrodynamics with multiple flavours of conserved U(1) charges. In theories with positive hydrodynamic entropy production, where the underlying perfect fluid has a positive speed of sound squared and satisfies the null energy condition, we show that hydrodynamic instabilities can arise only through negative diffusion coefficients associated with the U(1) charges. The onset of such instabilities is governed by the eigenvalues of the thermodynamic Hessian matrix, while the flavour-space polarisations of the unstable diffusion modes are determined by the corresponding eigenvectors. We illustrate this connection using strongly coupled N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory at finite densities of the three U(1) R-charges. In the dual holographic description, the five-dimensional STU black brane exhibits unstable quasinormal modes precisely at the onset of thermodynamic instability. We derive analytic expressions for the R-charge diffusion coefficients in several representative cases, including the configuration with three equal chemical potentials.

We review recent progress in Monte Carlo simulations of dense two-color QCD (QC$_2$D), focusing on the phase diagram, the equation of state, and the sound velocity in the low-temperature regime. In three-color QCD at finite density, especially at low temperatures, the notorious sign problem makes lattice Monte Carlo simulations intractable. In contrast, QC$_2$D is free from this issue due to the pseudoreality of the quark representation. Recent independent lattice studies have revealed unexpected phenomena through first-principles calculations of the phase structure and thermodynamics. A particularly notable finding is that the sound velocity exceeds the so-called conformal (holography) bound, \( c_s^2/c^2 \le 1/3 \), which had not been observed in QCD-like theories at finite temperature. In this review, we focus primarily on results from a series of works by our group~\cite{Iida:2019rah, Iida:2020emi,Iida:2022hyy, Ishiguro:2021yxr, Iida:2024irv}, along with related studies in dense QC$_2$D and three-color QCD with isospin chemical potential. We discuss the possibility and physical implications of conformal bound violation even for three-color dense QCD, together with insights from effective model analyses and recent observations of neutron stars.

Accessing nucleon transversity with one-point energy correlators

Comments:

Subjects:

We propose a novel probe of the nucleon's transversity distribution, $h_1^q$, using the one-point energy correlator (OPEC), an infrared-and-collinear safe jet substructure observable. We demonstrate that in transversely polarized $p^{\uparrow}p$ collisions, the OPEC exhibits a single-spin asymmetry (SSA) with a clean $\sin(\phi_s - \phi_n)$ angular dependence. This method probes SSA over a much wider kinematic range in the angular scale $\theta_n$ compared to traditional measurements of hadron transverse momentum~$j_\perp$, establishing a complementary and systematically distinct channel to study the nucleon's three-dimensional structure at RHIC and the future Electron-Ion Collider.
