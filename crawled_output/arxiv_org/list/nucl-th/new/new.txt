Title:
Abnormal dense and dilute nuclear systems

Nuclear Theory (nucl-th); Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)
Researchers have long been interested in exotic states of matter. In the early 1970s, Migdal proposed the existence of metastable or stable nuclei containing a pion condensate, and Bodmer posited the existence of collapsed nuclei with a quark core. Lee and Wick proposed that compressed nuclear matter could undergo a phase transition into a scalar condensate state with effectively very light baryons. In the mid-1980s, Witten pointed out that strange quark matter may be an absolutely stable form of matter that can exist in the form of quark strangelets. These hypotheses stimulated large experimental efforts to detect these states in heavy-ion collisions and in terrestrial samples. Additionally, the cosmos is the arena for a broad search for traces of exotic matter in compact objects and other energetic phenomena. We review various approaches and arguments for the possibility of abnormal states of matter, including metastable and stable dense objects with condensates, as well as dilute nuclear objects. Among these, we discuss scalar condensate and p-wave and s-wave pion condensations in dense nuclear systems and the formation of a $\Delta$ resonance matter. Then we consider a scalar mode condensation triggered by the Pomeranchuk instability in dilute nuclear matter, and clustering. We also mention recent ideas that a relativistic rotation and a dark-matter component may stabilize abnormal nuclear systems. Finally, we list some observational anomalies that cannot yet be appropriately explained by conventional physics.

Title:
Bayesian Constraints on Pre-Equilibrium Jet Quenching and Predictions for Oxygen Collisions

The contrast between the as-yet unmeasurable energy-loss effects in proton-nucleus collisions and the striking magnitude of the so-called high-momentum flow coefficients challenges our understanding of jet quenching mechanisms in large nucleus-nucleus collisions when applied to smaller systems. Intermediate-sized, light ion collisions will offer key insight into the system-size dependence of the interplay between jet energy loss and jet flow effects. To make quantitative predictions, we extend a semi-analytic jet quenching framework by coupling it to state-of-the-art event-by-event hydrodynamics and, for the first time, incorporate pre-equilibrium energy loss via the hydrodynamic attractor. A Bayesian analysis shows that an early-time onset of energy loss is compatible with RHIC and LHC measurements of jet suppression and jet elliptic flow in large systems, as well as hadron suppression, with the exception of hadron elliptic flow. Using these constraints, we predict both hadron and jet quenching observables in oxygen-oxygen collisions, finding sizable energy loss that exceeds the no-quenching baseline.

Title:
Multi-Cycle PWR Modeling with DRAGON and PARCS: Implications for Nuclear Data Assessment
Benjamin Arthur Hugo Meunier
Comments:

Subjects:
Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)
Nuclear data libraries serve as the foundation for all calculations in the nuclear field. Their quality directly affects the accuracy of computations. When new nuclear data libraries are released, they must undergo validation through the use of integral experimental data. This work introduces an automated simulation pipeline that converts raw nuclear data into predictions for various reactors, significantly enhancing the validation process. This pipeline allows for the assessment of potential biases in integral measurement predictions for nuclear power plants before the release of a new nuclear data library. To achieve this, an implementation of history variables in DRAGON was developed to determine the macroscopic cross sections of the nodal code PARCS. This method has been verified for seven depletion cycles across three pressurised water reactors (PWRs) against publicly available data. The errors on the predictions are in the uncertainty range attributed to variations in nuclear data. Additionally, a methodology to assess the quality of novel nuclear data libraries against experimental measurements in PWRs is presented.

Phenomenological constraints on QCD transport with quantified theory uncertainties
Sunil Jaiswal

6 pages, 3 figures; Supplemental Material included
Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)
We present data-driven, state-of-the-art constraints on the temperature-dependent specific shear and bulk viscosities of the quark-gluon plasma from Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}=2.76\,\mathrm{TeV}$. We perform global Bayesian calibration using the JETSCAPE multistage framework with two particlization ansätze, Grad 14-moment and first-order Chapman-Enskog, and quantify theoretical uncertainties via a centrality-dependent model discrepancy term. When theoretical uncertainties are neglected, the specific bulk viscosity and some model parameters inferred using the two ansätze exhibit clear tension. Once theoretical uncertainties are quantified, the Grad and Chapman-Enskog posteriors for all model parameters become almost statistically indistinguishable and yield reliable, uncertainty-aware constraints. Furthermore, the learned discrepancy identifies where each model falls short for specific observables and centrality classes, providing insight into model limitations.

Nonlinear dynamics of jet quenching

4 pages, Quark Matter 2025 Proceedings
Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)
We present an analytic framework for jet quenching in dense QCD matter that unifies medium-induced branching with vacuum collinear evolution. Energy transported outside the jet region is governed by a non-linear rate equation that resums arbitrary-angle gluon splittings, each enhanced by the medium length $L$. We show that for asymptotically large energies the energy-loss distribution for a single hard parton exhibits an exponential (generalized Poisson) behavior that provides the initial condition for a non-linear, DGLAP-like evolution that resums collinear logarithms associated with early in-vacuum fragmentation and with the angular resolution of the medium. This framework allows a systematic resummation of parton branching contributions to jet energy loss.

Title:
Tensor Spin Polarization Induced by Curved Freeze-Out Hypersurface
Zhong-Hua Zhang, Xu-Guang Huang
Comments:
21 pages, 1 figure
Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)
We investigate how the curvature of the freeze-out hypersurface polarizes massive vector bosons in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Starting from the Proca Lagrangian and using the Wigner function formalism, we perform a systematic gradient expansion to obtain a covariant spin-polarization tensor expressed in terms of hydrodynamic fields and the curvature tensor of the freeze-out hypersurface. Analytic results for Bjorken and Gubser flows show that curvature anisotropy generates a non-zero tensor polarization. For $\phi$ meson, we estimate the curvature contribution to its spin alignment as $ \delta \Theta_{yy} \sim -10^{-4} $ to $ -10^{-3} $. We also find that the curvature contribution grows as the system size decreases, suggesting that spin polarization measurements in small systems may provide a clean probe of this geometric effect.

Collinear Structure of Nonlinear Small-$x$ Evolution

We introduce a novel approach to high-energy QCD factorization of cross-sections for processes involving a dilute projectile and a dense target. Our method preserves the factorization between "fast" and "slow" modes in the longitudinal momentum $k^+$ for a projectile moving along the positive light-cone direction, making it compatible with higher-order loop computations done within the standard formulation of the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) effective field theory. Moreover, it eliminates the anomalous double collinear logarithms that typically hinder the convergence of perturbation theory at small-$x$. Our scheme amounts to a change of basis in the space of CGC operators, introducing an arbitrary transverse scale dependence while leaving physical cross-sections invariant. Implementing this scheme requires a modification of the high-energy renormalization group equation for the CGC operators, which we explicitly derive at next-to-leading order (NLO) and in the non-linear regime for the case of the dipole operator and the DIS impact factor. This general framework provides a consistent and systematic prescription for computing observables in the small-$x$ regime of QCD, free from collinear instabilities.

Title:
Studies of beauty hadron and non-prompt charm hadron production in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$=13 TeV within a transport model approach

Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)
In high-energy proton proton ($pp$) collisions at the LHC, non-prompt charm hadrons, originating from beauty hadron decays, provide a valuable probe for beauty quark dynamics, particularly at low transverse momentum where direct beauty measurements are challenging. We employ A Multi-Phase Transport Model (AMPT) of string melting version coupled with PYTHIA8 initial conditions to study the beauty hadron and non-prompt charm hadron productions in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV. In this work, the beauty quark mass during the generation stage has been increased to reproduce the measured $b\bar{b}$ cross section, and a beauty flavor specific coalescence parameter $r_{BM}^b$ is introduced to match LHCb measurements of beauty baryon to meson ratios. With these refinements, AMPT achieves a reasonable agreement with experimental data on beauty hadron yields and non-prompt charm hadron production from ALICE and LHCb. We present the transverse momentum and multiplicity dependence of non-prompt to prompt charm hadron ratios, providing new insights into the interplay between beauty quark production and hadronization process. We emphasize that the multiplicity dependence of the non-prompt to prompt charm hadron productions can be useful to constrain the flavor dependences of the coalescence dynamics. This work establishes a unified framework for future studies of heavy quark transport and collective flow behavior in small collision systems.

Title:
Peak of sound velocity, scale symmetry, and nuclear force in baryonic matter
Lu-Qi Zhang, Yao Ma, Yong-Liang Ma

Published version

Physical Review C 112, L031001 (2025)
Subjects:
Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)
The sound velocity in homogeneous matter has fundamental significance as it relates to the stiffness of the equation of state of compact star matter. In this work, we investigate the density evolution of the sound velocity in homogeneous {neutron matter at zero temperature} by using an effective field theory implemented with a conformal compensator -- the nonlinear realization of scale symmetry -- regarded as the source of the lightest scalar meson. We find that the peak of sound velocity emerges naturally in the intermediate density region, $(1-2.5)n_0$, without resorting to any transitions from hadron to exotic configurations or introducing new degrees of freedom. This phenomenon is not found in the Walecka-type models where the sigma meson is included in the linear-type approach, therefore it is an intrinsic character of the dilaton compensator approach through the matching of the QCD trace anomaly; a mechanism has not been found before, and it connects to the character of the lightest scalar meson. In addition, these observations shed light on how the hidden scale symmetry manifests in the nuclear medium from the unitarity limit in dilute matter to the dilaton limit in compact star matter.

Title:
Collective modes in relativistic asymmetric magnetized nuclear matter within the covariant Vlasov approach
Aziz Rabhi, Olfa Boukari, Sidney S. Avancini, Constança Providência
Comments:
14 pages, 5 figures, 1 table, to be submitted to Physical review C journal
Subjects:
Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)
The neutron-proton-electron (npe) matter under strong magnetic field is studied in the context of the covariant Vlasov approach. A covariant relativistic approach based on the Vlasov equation is applied to the study of infinite asymmetric magnetized nuclear matter. We use several relativistic mean-field nuclear models with non-linear terms. The dispersion relations for the longitudinal modes are obtained, and the isovector and isoscalar collective modes are determined in a wide range of densities as a function of the isospin asymmetry, momentum transfer, and magnetic field. A strong magnetic field gives rise to the appearance of low-lying isovector modes that propagate in nuclear matter, not present in non-magnetized matter. Neutron-like modes are essentially not affected by the presence of a strong magnetic field. In the presence of a strong magnetic field, Landau quantization modifies the proton-like collective modes, leading to the emergence of new branches associated with distinct Landau levels. These new modes can propagate even at high densities and exhibit isoscalar or isovector character.

Title:
$q_T$-slicing with multiple jets

Comments:
5 pages + supplemental material, 5 figures. v2: added proof of concept for slicing at NNLO for $e^+e^-$, and calculation of NNLO collinear-soft function for multi-jet configurations
Subjects:

Modern collider phenomenology requires unprecedented precision for the theoretical predictions, for which slicing techniques provide an essential tool at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in the strong coupling. The most popular slicing variable is based on the transverse momentum $q_T$ of a color-singlet final state, but its generalization to final states with jets is known to be very difficult. Here we propose two generalizations of $q_T$ that can be used for jet processes, providing proof of concept with an NLO slicing for $pp \to 2$ jets. We present factorization formulae that enable our approach to NNLO, calculate the NNLO collinear-soft function and demonstrate slicing at this order for $e^+e^- \to 2$ jets. One of these generalizations of $q_T$ only applies to planar Born processes, such as $pp \to 2$ jets, but offers a dramatic simplification of the soft function. We also discuss how our approach can directly be extended to obtain predictions for the fragmentation of hadrons. This presents a promising path for high-precision QCD calculations with multi-jet final states.

Title:
Goldstone bosons at non-zero temperature

Spontaneous symmetry breaking in quantum field theories at non-zero temperature still holds fundamental open questions, in particular what happens to vacuum Goldstone bosons when the temperature is increased. By investigating a complex scalar field theory on the lattice we demonstrate that Goldstone bosons at non-zero temperature behave like screened massless particle-like excitations, so-called thermoparticles, which continue to exist even in the symmetry-restored phase of the theory. We provide non-perturbative evidence for the functional form of the Goldstone mode's dissipative behaviour, and determine its corresponding spectral properties. Since the persistence of thermal Goldstone modes within symmetry-restored phases is predicted to be a model-independent characteristic, this has fundamental consequences for systems in which continuous symmetries are restored at high temperatures.

$^{208}$Pb nuclear charge radius revisited: closing the fine-structure-anomaly gap

A comprehensive reevaluation of the root-mean-square nuclear charge radius is presented for the doubly magic $^{208}$Pb extracted from muonic spectroscopy measurements. By integrating rigorous theoretical quantum electrodynamics calculations, state-of-the-art numerical methods, and a systematic reanalysis of the uncertainties, we reduced the long-standing muonic fine-structure anomaly and improved the goodness of fit by a factor of twenty. The resulting value of 5.5062(5)~fm for a Fermi distribution is fairly consistent with the previously reported muonic spectroscopy value, and three standard deviations larger than the commonly used compilation data, which indicates that the current value and its uncertainty could be significantly underestimated. Attributing the remaining discrepancy to theory errors which can not be rigorously calculated we suggest the rms charge radius with reduced model dependence to be 5.5062(17) fm. This work sets an improved benchmark for charge radius extraction in heavy nuclei and paves a path for systematic reevaluations across the nuclear chart.

We present a lattice determination of the heavy-quark diffusion coefficient in (2+1)-flavor QCD with almost physical quark masses. The momentum and spatial diffusion coefficients are extracted for a wide temperature range, from $T=163$ MeV to $10$ GeV. The results are in agreement with previous works from the HotQCD collaboration, and show fast thermalization of the heavy quark inside the QGP. Near the chiral crossover temperature $T_c\simeq150$ MeV, our results are close to the AdS/CFT estimation computed at strong coupling.

On the High Excitation 7$α$ De-exciting States in $^{28}$Si$^*$

Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)
A direct comparison and analysis of published spectra for the 7$\alpha$ disassembly of $^{28}$Si projectiles excited in collisions with $^{12}$C at 35 MeV/u reveals significant agreement in the derived excitation energies of high excitation energy resonances observed in two different experiments, in contrast to some earlier conclusions reported in the literature. Many of the observed resonances have excitation energies consistent with those arrived at in recent theoretical investigations explicitly predicting the excitation energies and spins of toroidal nuclei. An AI-assisted application of well-established statistical filtering techniques reveals identical structures in all spectra investigated. Some additional peaks are observed. The possibility that they correspond to other favored geometries is discussed.

Equation of State Extrapolation Systematics: Parametric vs. Nonparametric Inference of Neutron Star Structure
Bhaskar Biswas
Comments:
10 pages, 6 figures
Subjects:
High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)
The equation of state (EOS) of cold dense matter is a central open problem in nuclear astrophysics. Its inference is hindered by the lack of \textit{ab initio} control above about twice nuclear saturation density, requiring extrapolation. Parametric schemes such as piecewise polytropes (PP) are efficient but restrictive, while nonparametric approaches like Gaussian processes (GP) allow more flexibility at the cost of larger prior volumes. We extend our hybrid EOS framework by replacing the high-density polytropic extension with a GP representation of the squared sound speed, anchored at low densities by the SLy crust EOS and a nuclear meta-model constrained by $\chi$EFT and laboratory data. Using hierarchical Bayesian analysis, we jointly constrain the EOS and neutron star mass distribution with multi-messenger observations, including NICER radii, GW170817 and GW190425 tidal deformabilities, pulsar masses, and neutron skin experiments. We examine four scenarios defined by high-density extrapolation (PP vs.\ GP) and hotspot geometry in the NICER modeling of PSR~J0030$+$0451 (ST+PDT vs.\ PDT-U). GP extrapolations generally yield softer EOS posteriors with broader uncertainties. Hotspot assumptions also play an important role, shifting inferred mass--radius relations. Bayesian evidence strongly favors the ST+PDT geometry over PDT-U under both extrapolations, while GP is mildly preferred over PP. These results underscore the impact of observational modeling and EOS extrapolation on neutron star inferences, and show that a GP-based extension offers a robust way to quantify systematic uncertainties in high-density matter.
