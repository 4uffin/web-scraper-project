Physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) has yet to be observed at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), motivating the development of model-agnostic, machine learning-based strategies to probe more regions of the phase space. As many final states have not yet been examined for mass resonances, an accelerated approach to bump-hunting is desirable. BumpNet is a neural network trained to map smoothly falling invariant-mass histogram data to statistical significance values. It provides a unique, automatized approach to mass resonance searches with the capacity to scan hundreds of final states reliably and efficiently.

We study the viability of light thermal dark matter (DM) in sub-GeV mass range in view of the stringent new DAMIC-M limits on DM-electron scattering. Considering a Dirac fermion singlet DM charged under a new Abelian gauge symmetry $U(1)$, we outline two possibilities: (i) family non-universal $U(1)$ gauge coupling with resonantly enhanced DM annihilation into standard model (SM) fermions and (ii) family universal dark $U(1)$ gauge symmetry where relic is set by DM annihilation into light gauge bosons. As an illustrative example of the first class of models, we consider a gauged $L_\mu-L_\tau$ extension of the SM having interesting detection prospects at several experiments. While both of these class of models lead to observed DM relic and consistency with DAMIC-M together with other experimental limits, the second class of models also lead to strong DM self-interactions, potentially solving the small-scale structure issues of cold dark matter. While a vast part of the parameter space in both the models is already ruled out, the current allowed region of parameter space can be further probed at ongoing or future experiments keeping the models testable.

Title:

We present a systematic study of triple Higgs boson production at future high-energy hadron colliders, using the six-$b$-jet final state as a probe of the Higgs self-interactions. We conduct, under realistic detector smearing assumptions, both a traditional cut-based analysis, and a multivariate one using gradient boosting. The multivariate strategy is found to enhance sensitivity to beyond the Standard Model effects on the Higgs boson's self-couplings, while preserving large signal event yields, thus enabling more robust statistical inference. This allows us to assess the impact of detector effects, systematic uncertainties, background normalisation, as well as different truncation choices in an effective-field-theory description of the new physics effects possibly affecting the Higgs boson's self-interactions. Our results demonstrate that statistically-meaningful and perturbative-unitarity-compatible constraints on the trilinear and quartic Higgs boson self-couplings can be achieved, provided that systematic uncertainties are controlled at the few-percent level. Finally, we extrapolate our results to various collider energies and luminosities, demonstrating in particular that an 85 TeV proton-proton collider performs comparably to a 100 TeV machine. Altogether, our findings therefore establish the six-$b$ channel as a viable probe of the Higgs self-interactions at most future hadron collider options currently being examined by the high-energy physics community.

Previous work has shown that mesonic fields in chiral Lagrangians can be systematically connected to quark-level operators in QCD sum rules through chiral-symmetry constrained and energy-independent scale factor matrices. This framework yields universal scale factors associated with each chiral nonet, whether composed of quark-antiquark ($q\bar{q}$) or four-quark ($qq\bar{q}\bar{q}$) operators. Building on the demonstrated scale-factor universality for the $K_0^*$ isodoublet and $a_0$ isotriplet scalar mesons, we develop a revised Gaussian QCD sum-rule methodology that extends the analysis to higher-dimensional isospin sectors. To access nonperturbative information about resonances arising from final-state interactions, we introduce a background-resonance interference approximation. This approximation successfully reproduces both $\pi K$ scattering amplitude data and $\pi\eta$ scattering predictions. It also motivates new resonance models that enhance the scale-factor analysis linking chiral Lagrangians to QCD sum rules. Within this refined framework, we explore the scale factors for the $K_0^*$ and $a_0$ mesons across a sequence of increasingly detailed resonance models.

Using a set of missing energy-independent selection criteria involving large-radius jet multiplicity and angular separation among the final states, we extend the discovery potential of the stealth SUSY squark-pair production in the low missing transverse energy (ETmiss) parameter space, thereby complementing existing ATLAS and CMS searches that are sensitive in the high ETmiss regime. With these kinematic cuts, the estimated sensitivity was extended to squark masses up to 2500 GeV for a bino mass of 650 GeV.

Title:
Heavy quarkonium decay $V \to ggg$ with both relativistic and QCD radiative corrections

High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)
In the heavy quarkonium decay process $ V \to ggg $ ($ V=J/\psi, \Upsilon $), making a definite prediction including relativistic corrections has so far remained a significant challenge. In this work, we study this decay process by taking into account the relativistic corrections in the Bethe-Salpeter formalism, where the relativistic bound-state wave function of quarkonium is obtained by solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation under the covariant instantaneous ansatz. Through analytical calculation, we find that some polarized decay widths vanish due to the helicity selection rule, which suppresses the corresponding helicity amplitudes. Owing to helicity flip symmetry and phase space symmetry, the nonvanishing polarized decay widths are not all independent; they are related through a set of symmetry relations. Then we obtain the unpolarized decay width formula $\Gamma(V \to ggg)=\frac{80(\pi^{2}-9)\alpha_{s}^{3}N_{V}^{2}\beta_{V}^{3}}{81\pi^{9/2} M } (1-\kappa\frac{\beta_{V}^{2}}{M^{2}})$, where the factor $\kappa\frac{\beta_{V}^{2}}{M^{2}}$ arises from the relativistic corrections with $\kappa\equiv\frac{3(112+25\pi^{2})}{16(\pi^{2}-9)}$. Furthermore, including both relativistic and QCD radiative corrections within the factorization assumption, our predictions of $\mathcal{B}(V \to ggg)$ and $\mathcal{B}(V \to e^{+}e^{-})$ agree well with their experimental data. As a crossing check, with the experimental value of the ratio $R_{V} = \frac{\Gamma(V \to ggg)}{\Gamma(V \to e^{+}e^{-})}$ and our result for $R_{V}$, we extract $\alpha_{s}(M_{J/\psi}/2)=0.31$ and $\alpha_{s}(M_{\Upsilon}/2)=0.20$, respectively.

We study collective excitations in a relativistic collisionless plasma composed of massless fermions subject to an external magnetic field. We include dynamical electromagnetism and fluctuations of the chiral charge, while maintaining a vanishing net chiral charge. Within the framework of chiral kinetic theory, we find that the chiral anomaly gives a correction to the dispersion relation of the transverse mode. In a strong magnetic field, we also show that the collective mode has a gap using the lowest Landau level approximation. We discuss the anomalous correction in the context of neutron star phenomenology.

We demonstrate that the Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC) and the Festina-Lente Conjecture (FLC) yield novel bounds on fifth force searches and milli-Charged Particles (mCPs), as well as on the scale of inflation and on the effective Higgs quartic interaction. In particular, we find that combining the FLC with inflation leads to stronger bounds on mCPs than what the simple application of the FLC provides. Furthermore, we have explored the implications of naturalness on both the FLC and WGC, and have found that these conjectures place a lower limit on the charge of a $U(1)$ gauge group.

The vacuum stability and the hierarchy problem in a fermionic dark matter model
Mojtaba Hosseini

Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)
We consider an extension to the Standard Model (SM) with four new fields including scalar($S$), spinor($\psi^{1,2}$) and vector($V_\mu$) under new $U(1)$ gauge group in the hidden sector. The scalar particle interacts with the SM Higgs particle and is an intermediary between the dark and the SM parts . Our dark matter(DM) candidate is the spinor particle. We show that the model successfully explains the relic density of the DM in the universe and evades the strong bounds from direct detection experiments while respecting the theoretical constraints and the vacuum stability conditions. In addition, we study the hierarchy problem within the Veltman approach by solving the renormalization group equations at one-loop. We demonstrate that the addition of the new fields contributes to the Veltman parameters which in turn results in satisfying the Veltman conditions much lower than the Planck scale. For the our DM model we find one representative point in the viable parameter space which satisfy also the Veltman conditions at $\Lambda$ = 1 TeV. Therefore, the presence of the extra particle solves the fine-tuning problem of the Higgs mass.

Rescattering-induced $D\to SS$ weak decays

We investigate two-body non-leptonic $D\to SS$ weak decays, where $S$ denotes a light scalar meson such as $a_0/a_0(980)$, $f_0/f_0(980)$, or $\sigma_0/f_0(500)$. Short-distance topologies from $W$-boson emission and annihilation (exchange) are found to be negligible, while long-distance final-state interactions provide the dominant contributions. In particular, triangle rescattering processes, $D \to \pi\eta^{(\prime)} \to \sigma_0 a_0$ and $D \to a_1(1260)\eta \to \sigma_0 a_0$, mediated by pion exchange in $\pi\eta^{(\prime)}$ and $a_1(1260)\eta$ scatterings, respectively, are identified as the leading mechanisms. Our calculations yield branching fractions ${\cal B}(D_s^+ \to \sigma_0 a_0^+) = (1.0 \pm 0.2^{+0.1}_{-0.2}) \times 10^{-2}$, ${\cal B}(D^+ \to \sigma_0 a_0^+) = (1.1 \pm 0.2^{+0.1}_{-0.2}) \times 10^{-3}$, and ${\cal B}(D^0 \to \sigma_0 a_0^0) = (0.9 \pm 0.2^{+0.2}_{-0.3}) \times 10^{-5}$. For the Cabibbo-allowed decay mode $D_s^+ \to f_0 a_0^+$, the near-threshold condition $m_{D_s}\simeq m_{f_0}+m_{a_0}$ limits the phase space, suppressing the branching fraction to $(3.4\pm0.3^{+0.4}_{-0.9})\times 10^{-4}$. These results highlight rescattering-induced $D\to SS$ decays as promising channels for experimental studies at BESIII, Belle(-II), and LHCb.

On the solution of Euclidean path integrals with neural networks
Gabor Balassa
Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)
This paper proposes a numerical method using neural networks to solve the path integral problem in quantum mechanics for arbitrary potentials. The method is based on a radial basis function expansion of the interaction term that appears in the Euclidean path integral formalism. By constructing a corresponding multi-layered perceptron-type neural network with exponential nonlinearities in the hidden layer, the original path integral can be approximated by a linear combination of Gaussian path integrals that can be solved analytically. The method has been tested for the double-well potential that includes a quadratic and a quartic term, giving very good, within a few percent agreement between the true and estimated bound state wave functions that are extracted from the propagator at large Euclidean times. The proposed method can also be used to describe potentials that have imaginary parts, which is tested for a simple Gaussian path integral with complex frequencies, where the model uncertainty stays below one percent for both the real and imaginary parts of the propagator.

Axions and axion-like particles are ubiquitous in extensions of the Standard Model and offer a unifying perspective on open problems in cosmology. Depending on their mass and interactions, axions can act as dark matter, drive cosmic acceleration as dark energy, or contribute to the relativistic background as dark radiation. Motivated by the plenary talk at TAUP 2025, this proceeding reviews the phenomenology of light bosons in the early and late Universe, with a focus on the theoretical foundations, observational signatures, and experimental prospects.

We build a deep neural network model to predict meson widths from quantum numbers and masses based on the Transformer architecture. A Gaussian Monte-Carlo data enhancement method is adopted to enhance the meson data by considering the experimental errors, which significantly increase the data samples and improve the robustness and generalization performance of the model. With the meson widths ranging from $\sim10^{-14}$ to 625 MeV, the relative errors of the predictions behave $0.07\%$, $1.0\%$, and $0.14\%$ in the training set, the test set, and all the data, respectively. The width predictions are presented for the currently discovered mesons and some theoretically predicted states. We also use the model as a probe to study the quantum numbers and inner structures for some undetermined states. Furthermore, this data-driven model is investigated to show well charge conjugation symmetry and approximate isospin symmetry, which is consistent with the physical phenomena. The results indicate that the deep neural network has powerful learning and inference abilities to describe and explore the hadron structures and the complicated interactions in particle physics.

Decaying vector dark matter with low reheating temperature for KM3NeT signal and its impact on gravitational waves
Sarif Khan, Jongkuk Kim, Hyun Min Lee
Comments:

Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE)
We propose a new model to explain the KM3NeT neutrino event through a low reheating scenario with a suppression in the GW spectrum originating from cosmic string networks. To achieve this, we extend the SM gauge sector by an abelian gauge symmetry and a singlet scalar. Once the abelian gauge symmetry spontaneously breaks, the extra gauge boson acquires mass and becomes a suitable Dark Matter (DM) candidate. Due to the kinetic mixing with the hypercharge gauge group, DM can decay into SM particles. To explain the KM3NeT signal, we need $\mathcal{O}(100)$ PeV DM, which can be produced in the correct order of DM density in a low reheating scenario. In this scenario, the overabundance issue of heavy DM can be tackled by diluting its abundance through the continuous injection of entropy when the matter-like inflaton decays into the SM bath. Using the low reheating scenario, we can obtain the correct value of DM density both for freeze-out and freeze-in mechanisms for super-heavy DM. Moreover, we have studied the Gravitational Waves (GWs) produced from cosmic strings, which fall within the detectable range of future proposed GW experiments. Additionally, the dominance of a quadratic inflaton potential before the reheating temperature changes the temperature-scale factor relation, which suppresses the GW spectrum at higher frequencies. Choosing an arbitrarily low reheating temperature provides only a tiny fraction of the DM density due to dilution from entropy injection. This fraction of the vector DM suggests that only the extragalactic contribution is relevant in the KM3NeT event because DM lifetime is shorter than the age of the Universe.

Electromagnetic structure of axial-vector mesons and implications for the muon $g-2$

Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)
The electromagnetic structure of axial-vector mesons is investigated via elastic and two-photon transition form factors (TFFs). To this end, we employ a framework based on the Dyson-Schwinger and Bethe-Salpeter equations within a contact interaction model. This largely algebraic approach transparently exposes the role of symmetries and their breaking, and has proven successful in describing anomaly-sensitive processes, including pseudoscalar to two-photon TFFs, $\gamma \to 3 \pi$, and vector-to-pseudoscalar radiative decays. Restricting our analysis to the lowest-lying states, $\text{A}=\{ a_1, f_1,f_1'\}$, we also evaluate the corresponding light-by-light contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment, and obtain $a_\mu^{\text{A}}=11.30(4.71)\times10^{-11}$, consistent with contemporary estimates.

Soft contributions to heavy quark production in arbitrary kinematics
Simone Devoto, Javier Mazzitelli
Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)
We present the computation of the soft-parton contribution at low transverse momentum for the production of a heavy quark pair in association with a colour singlet at the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in the QCD coupling. This paper extends to arbitrary kinematics previous results obtained under the assumption of a back-to-back configuration for the final-state emitters. These new results take into account the production of an additional colour singlet system, thus allowing for the evaluation of the resummation formula for associated heavy-quark pair production at NNLO, and the implementation of the qT subtraction formalism for this class of processes. We provide the results in the form of a code for their on-the-fly evaluation.

We examine the spectrum of the $\Sigma\,(\frac{1}{2}^-)$ family based on the experimental $K^-p$ scattering data and lattice QCD simulations within the Hamiltonian Effective Field Theory. Especially, two different scenarios are constructed in order to clarify whether there is one or two $\Sigma\,(\frac{1}{2}^-)$ resonances with masses around 1.5$\sim$1.7 GeV. The relevant lattice QCD data support our scenario with two resonance poles at $1687-110\,i$ and $1714-14\,i$ MeV in which the bare strange triquark core plays an important role. We also show an extra clear cusp structure around 1.4 GeV in our scattering T matrices associated with the odd-parity strange baryons.

Color gauge invariant theory of diquark interactions

Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)
In the present work, we construct a color gauge invariant theory of diquark interactions. With the transformation rule of the diquark fields and the definition of the covariant derivatives under color SU(3) symmetry, we construct the gauge invariant Lagrangians describing the vertices of $S-S-G$, $A-A-G$, $S_Q-S_Q-G$, $A_Q-A_Q-G$ and $S_Q-A_Q-G$, where $S_{(Q)}$ is the light (heavy) scalar diquark field, $A_{(Q)}$ is the light (heavy) axial vector diquark field, and $G$ is the gluon field. And then we derive the one-gluon-exchange effective potentials for diquark-antidiquark interactions using the obtained Lagrangians. By comparing these potentials with those in Godfrey-Isgur quark model, the coupling constants of the Lagrangians are determined. We find that the potentials are mainly made of Coulomb, contact and tensor terms. The potential for the process $S\bar{A}\to A\bar{S}$ is 0, since $\mathcal{L}_{SAG}=0$. And the tensor terms proportional to $g^2$ are negligible.

High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)
We present the first next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^3$LO) calculation of the twist-2 matching coefficients for transverse momentum dependent (TMD) quark transversity parton distribution and fragmentation functions in QCD. This matching relates the TMD quark transversity functions to their collinear counterparts in the large-transverse-momentum regime, and provides essential ingredients for precision TMD phenomenology involving transversely polarized beams. As part of our analysis, we also compute the complete set of next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) DGLAP splitting functions governing the QCD evolution of collinear transversity distributions. These results extend the perturbative toolkit for spin-dependent observables and establish the transversity sector on the same theoretical footing as unpolarized and helicity distributions. Our findings enable high-precision extractions of transversity PDFs and facilitate improved theoretical predictions for azimuthal asymmetries in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering (SIDIS), especially in light of forthcoming data from the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC).

High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)
We investigate the partonic origin of the proton longitudinal spin using spin-dependent energy correlator measured in lepton-hadron collisions with longitudinally polarized proton beams. These observables encode angular correlations in energy flow and are sensitive to the spin-momentum structure of confined partons. Using soft-collinear effective theory (SCET), we analyze the correlation patterns in both nearly back-to-back and forward limits, which establishes a direct correspondence with longitudinally polarized transverse momentum dependent distributions (TMDs) and nucleon energy correlators (NECs). The TMDs and NECs allow consistent matching onto hard radiation region, and provide a comprehensive description of the transition from perturbative parton branching to nonperturbative confinement. Using renormalization group evolution, we obtain joint $\text{N}^{3}$LL/NNLL quantitative predictions for spin-dependent energy correlation patterns in the current and target fragmentation regions (CFR and TFR). The framework provides new theoretical insight into how the internal motion and spin of partons contribute to the formation of the proton longitudinal spin, and offers an experimental paradigm for probing the interplay between color confinement and spin dynamics at forthcoming Electron-Ion Collider (EIC).

A unified coupled-channel description for the five near-threshold structures $ψ(3770)$, $G(3900)$, $R(3760)$, $R(3780)$ and $R(3810)$ from $e^+e^-$ annihilation

The recent observation of multiple near-threshold structures in $e^+e^-$ annihilation-including $\psi(3770)$, $G(3900)$, $R(3760)$, $R(3780)$, and $R(3810)$-reveals limitations in existing models of charmonium and exotic hadrons. In this Letter, we propose a unified coupled-channel description that simultaneously incorporates all five near-threshold structures using parameters constrained by hadron spectroscopy. Our model accurately reproduces the line shapes in both $D\bar{D}$ and non-open-charm hadron (nOCH) channels, resolves the asymmetric profile of $\psi(3770)$, and produces the $G(3900)$ bump. We identify the $R(3780)$ as the dominant manifestation of $\psi(3770)$, attribute $R(3760)$ to $D\bar{D} \to \text{nOCH}$ rescattering and suggest that $R(3810)$ arises from coupling between the $\psi(1D)$ state and the $h_c\pi\pi$ channel. The significant non-$D\bar{D}$ decay of $\psi(3770)$ is explained by its near-threshold position. This analysis provides a coherent, unquenched framework centered on a charmonium $\psi(1D)$ core for near-threshold phenomena and offers a predictive approach extendable to bottomonium systems and future data from Belle II.

$$
e^+e^- \to Z \to \gamma a,\quad a \to \ell^+ \ell^-,

where we consider final states with two prompt leptons and one photon, or only one photon (Mono-$\gamma$). We estimate the sensitivity to the ALP mass $m_a$ and associated energy scale $\Lambda$ for $a\to\mu^+\mu^-$ and $a\to\tau^+\tau^-$ (with leptonic decays of the $\tau$) by use of a XGBoost classifier. For an integrated luminosity of 150 ab$^{-1}$ at the Z-pole, the combined leptonic channel can probe the ALP scale $\Lambda$ between $10$ to $700$~TeV, depending on the ALP mass. The Mono-$\gamma$ signal offers a complementary probe, reaching $\Lambda$ up to $2000$~TeV for masses below $20$~GeV.

Momentum correlation in pair production by spacetime dependent fields from scattered wave functions
Greger Torgrimsson
Comments:

Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
We consider Sauter-Schwinger pair production by electric fields that depend on both time and space, $E(t,z)$ and $E(t,x,y)$. For space-independent fields, $E(t)$, momentum conservation, $\delta({\bf p}+{\bf p}')$, fixes the positron momentum, ${\bf p}'$, in terms of the electron momentum, ${\bf p}$. For $E(t,z)$, on the other hand, $p_z$ and $p'_z$ are independent. However, previous exact-numerical studies have considered only the probability as a function of a single momentum variable, $P(p_z)$, $P(p'_z)$ or $P(p'_z-p_z)$, but not the correlation $P(p_z,p'_z)$. In this paper, we show how to obtain $P(p_z,p'_z)$ by solving the Dirac equation numerically. To do so, we split the wave function into a background and a scattered wave, $\psi(t,{\bf x})=\psi_{\rm back.}(t,{\bf x})+\psi_{\rm scat.}(t,{\bf x})$, where $\psi_{\rm back.}\propto\exp(\pm ipx+\text{gauge term})$. $\psi_{\rm scat.}$ vanishes outside a past light cone and is obtained by solving $(i\mathcal{D}-m)\psi_{\rm scat.}=-(i\mathcal{D}-m)\psi_{\rm back}$ backwards in time starting with $\psi_{\rm scat.}(t\to+\infty,{\bf x})=0$.

It is well known that soft singularities of massless amplitudes are significantly simpler than those of massive ones. However, the computation of the soft anomalous dimension (AD) using Wilson-lines correctors is only straightforward in the massive case, thanks to the multiplicative renormalizability of correlators of non-lightlike Wilson lines. Instead, correlators involving lightlike lines, develop higher-order poles in dimensional regularization due to collinear singularities, on top of their ultraviolet divergences. We nevertheless show, using the method of regions, how correlators involving lightlike lines can be interpreted and used in the computation of the multileg soft AD. As a case study, we compute the two-loop soft AD for two massive and one massless particles. To this end, we start with the correlator of three timelike Wilson lines and apply the method of regions in the limit where one of the lines becomes lightlike. A correlator involving a strictly lightlike line then emerges as the "hard region" in this expansion. Its collinear divergences are removed upon adding the remaining regions, recovering the correct ultraviolet pole corresponding to the sought-after AD. By applying the method of regions, we are able to disentangle between ultraviolet and infrared divergences appearing in the strict limit. We also discover new phenomena, such as hard-virtuality collinear modes whose presence reflects the rescaling symmetry of semi-infinite Wilson lines. Our approach generalizes to any combination of massive and massless particles at higher loop order.

The flux of astrophysical neutrinos is now measured with unprecedented accuracy and on several decades of energy spectrum. Their origin traces back to hadronic collisions between protons and nuclei in the cosmic rays with hydrogen and helium in the target gas. To accurately interpret the data, a precise determination of the underlying cross sections is therefore mandatory. We present a new evaluation of the neutrino production cross section from $p+p$ collisions, building on our previous analysis of the production cross section for $\pi^\pm$, $K^\pm$, and minor baryonic and mesonic channels. Cross sections for scatterings involving nuclei heavier than protons are also derived. The novelty of our approach is the analytical description of the Lorentz invariant cross section $\sigma_{\rm inv}$, and the fit of the model to the available accelerator data. We work with neutrino energies from $10$ GeV to $10^7$ GeV, and, correspondingly, to incident proton (nuclei) energies from $10$ GeV to $10^9$ GeV (GeV/n). We obtain the total differential cross section, $d\sigma(p+p\rightarrow \nu+X)/dE_{\nu}$ as a function of neutrino and proton energies, with an estimated uncertainty of 5% for neutrino energies below 100 GeV, increasing to 10% above TeV energies. Predictions are given for $\nu_e, \nu_\mu, \bar{\nu_e}$ and $\bar{\nu_\mu}$. A comparison with state-of-the-art cross sections, all relying on Monte Carlo generators, is also presented. To facilitate the use by the community, we provide numerical tables and a script for accessing our energy-differential cross sections.

The core of a massive star (M > 8 Msun) eventually collapses. This implosion usually triggers a supernova (SN) explosion that ejects most of the stellar envelope and leaves behind a neutron star (NS) with a mass of up to about 2 Msun. Sometimes the explosion fails and a black hole forms instead. The NS radiates its immense binding energy (some 10% of its rest mass or $2-4\times10^{53}$ erg) almost entirely as neutrinos and antineutrinos of all flavors with typical energies of some 10 MeV. This makes core-collapse SNe the most powerful neutrino factories in the Universe. Such a signal was observed once - with limited statistics - from SN 1987A in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Today, however, many large neutrino detectors act as SN observatories and would register a high-statistics signal. A future Galactic SN, though rare (1-3 per century), would produce a wealth of astrophysical and particle-physics information, including possible signatures for new particles. Neutrinos are key to SN dynamics in the framework of the Bethe-Wilson delayed explosion paradigm. After collapse, they are trapped in the core for a few seconds, forming a dense neutrino plasma that can exhibit collective flavor evolution caused by the weak interaction, a subject of intense theoretical research.

Recent non-modal analyses have uncovered spectral instabilities in the quasinormal-mode spectrum of black holes; a phenomenon that intriguingly extends to spherically-symmetric exotic compact objects. These results point to a sensitivity of the spectrum with potentially far-reaching implications for black-hole spectroscopy. At the same time, growing attention has turned to astrophysical environments around compact objects and their role in shaping gravitational-wave astrophysics. In this work, we establish a direct link between spectral instabilities and environmental effects by modeling matter as a localized bump outside the light ring of a spectrally-unstable exotic compact object with a purely reflective surface. We find that while such environments can destabilize the fundamental quasinormal modes of loosely-compact exotic objects, the fundamental modes of ultra-compact horizonless objects remain remarkably robust. In contrast, overtones are shown to develop spectral instabilities in the presence of the bump. By tracking both interior modes, trapped between the light ring and the surface of the exotic compact object, and exterior modes, confined between the bump and the light ring, we uncover an overtaking instability in which ``unperturbed'' exterior overtones metamorphose into ``perturbed'' fundamental modes as the bump moves outward. Finally, we demonstrate that environmental effects, while capable of further amplifying spectral instabilities, cannot induce next-to-leading-order perturbations strong enough to trigger a modal instability.

Dark interactions in neutron star interiors: the interplay of baryons, dark matter, and dark energy

The impact of energy exchange among the relevant fluid components: baryonic matter, fermionic dark matter (DM), and dark energy (DE) on the internal structure of neutron stars is investigated. Using a representative DM mass $m_{\chi} = 10$ GeV and a barotropic DE relation, we add source terms Qi to the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations and examine three cases: (i) noninteracting fluids (Model I), (ii) fully interacting baryon plus DM and DM with DE fluids with optional DM self repulsion (Model II), and (iii) a unified dark sector coupled to baryons (Model III). Two effects dominate: softening by massive, pressure-poor DM, and additional softening/ and binding from DE with negative pressures. Model I isolates these baselines. In Model II, exchange terms self regulate, making the mass radius curves nearly independent of the coupling parameter $\alpha$ for nearly five orders of magnitude. Model III breaks this $\alpha$ degeneracy: a sizable vacuum fraction suppresses the baryonic pressure gradient, reducing both the maximum mass and radii, whereas a pure-DM core is less sensitive. We outline when dark interactions can leave observable, macroscopic imprints.

Solution to the uncertainty problem of nuclear matrix element for neutrinoless double-$β$ decay

The neutrinoless double-$\beta$ decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$) of nuclei is one of the major research subjects of neutrino physics nowadays because of its influence on particle physics and astrophysics. The predicted nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) of the $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay have a large uncertainty depending on the models used to calculate them. This problem has affected the development of neutrino physics for many years. We have performed, recently, the calculation of the NMEs for the $0\nu\beta\beta$ and two-neutrino double-$\beta$ decay ($2\nu\beta\beta$) modes with a perturbed transition operator and found that the effective axial-vector current coupling ($g_A^\mathrm{eff}$) is similar for these two decay modes. Based on this finding, we calculate the $0\nu\beta\beta$ NMEs using the phenomenological $g_A^\mathrm{eff}$ that reproduces the measured half-life of the $2\nu\beta\beta$ decay. We apply this method to the NMEs for $^{136}$Xe obtained by several groups and show that the uncertainty of the $0\nu\beta\beta$ NME is dramatically reduced. Owing to this finding, we calculate the effective neutrino mass, consistent with the current experimental lower limit of the half-life for the $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay, and the results indicate that this effective neutrino mass value does not yet reach the inverted mass hierarchy region allowed by the neutrino oscillation data and the lightest neutrino mass assumed to be smaller than 10 meV.

Quantum mechanics predicts deviations from exponential decay at short and long times, yet experimental evidence is limited. We report a power-law tail after $\sim$10 lifetimes in erythrosine~B fluorescence, confirmed by two detectors probing distinct bands but yielding different power coefficients. The data match a divergent but normalizable spectral density, and theory predicts oscillations as a future test. A novel and general result is that in multichannel QM (and QFT) decay the lifetime is universal, but the late-time deviations exhibit a sizeable time window in which they are channel (or band) dependent, a feature consistent with our data.

Ultra-high-energy (UHE) neutrinos are unique cosmic messengers that can traverse cosmological distances unattenuated, offering direct insight into the most energetic processes in the universe. Radio detection promises significant advantages for detecting highly inclined air showers induced by UHE neutrinos, including a larger exposure range compared to particle detectors, which is due to minimal atmospheric attenuation of radio signals combined with good reconstruction precision. Furthermore, this technique improves the air shower longitudinal reconstruction, which can be used to identify neutrinos with their first interaction far below the top of the atmosphere. In this work, we present a method for identifying UHE neutrinos using radio antennas deployed in ground-based observatories. We introduce a reconstruction algorithm based on the radio emission maximum ($X^{\text{radio}}_{\text{max}}$) and demonstrate its power in distinguishing deeply developing neutrino-induced showers from background cosmic rays. Using the Pierre Auger Observatory as a case study, we use the simulations of $\nu_e$-CC-induced air showers and evaluate the trigger efficiency, reconstruction performance, and resulting effective area. Our results show that radio detection significantly enhances the sensitivity to very inclined showers above 1~EeV, complementing traditional surface detectors. This technique is highly scalable and applicable to future radio observatories such as GRAND. The proposed reconstruction and identification strategy provides a pathway toward achieving the sensitivity needed to detect UHE neutrinos.

Current cosmological data seem to show that dark energy is evolving in time and that it possibly crossed the phantom divide in the past. So far the only theories that lead to such a behavior involve a non-trivial coupling between dark energy, in the form of a scalar field, and the gravitational or matter sector. We show that there is another possibility involving both a non-trivial kinetic sector in a cubic Galileon theory and a scalar field potential that breaks the Galileon shift symmetry, which can lead to a similar phenomenology on large scales. We perform a full Bayesian analysis using the latest cosmological data, including DESI DR2 BAO measurements, type Ia SNe measurements from DESY5, Union3, and Pantheon+, and CMB data from Planck and ACT. We find that it is statistically strongly favored over a Universe dominated by a cosmological constant (with a Bayes factor of $\log B\simeq 6.5$). Yet, as with other non-minimally coupled theories, it has severe ancillary gravitational effects. These can be mitigated to some extent, but as with other viable theories, the penalty is ever more elaborate scalar field models of dark energy.

An important question in heavy-ion collisions is how the initial far-from-equilibrium medium evolves and thermalizes while it undergoes a rapid longitudinal expansion. In this presentation, we show how to use the two-particle irreducible (2PI) effective action to address this question, focusing on $\phi^4$ scalar theory truncated at three loops. We present numerical results for quantities such as the occupation number, the thermal mass, and the number density.

Critical Points and Syzygies for Feynman Integrals

We investigate a novel theoretical structure underlying the computation of integration-by-parts relations between Feynman integrals via syzygy-based methods. Building on insights from intersection theory, we analyze the large-$\epsilon$ limit of dimensional regularization on the maximal cut, showing that total derivatives vanish on the critical locus of the logarithm of the Baikov polynomial--the locus known to govern the number of master integrals. We introduce "critical syzygies" as a distinguished subset of syzygies that captures this behavior. We show that, when the critical locus is isolated, critical syzygies generate a sufficient set of total derivatives in the large-$\epsilon$ limit. We study their structure analytically at one loop and develop a numerical approach for their construction at two loops. Our results demonstrate that critical syzygies are a valuable tool for integral reduction in cutting-edge two-loop examples, offering a novel geometric perspective on integration-by-parts relations.

Despite decades of direct and indirect searches within the Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) framework, no conclusive results have been found in the GeV--TeV range. This has motivated exploring alternatives, including new particles and macroscopic objects. Two well-motivated scenarios are sub-GeV DM and Primordial Black Holes (PBHs). Molecular clouds (MCs), typically studied as star-forming sites, can serve as astrophysical laboratories to probe these candidates via their ionization rates. Observations show ionization levels exceeding expectations from known CR fluxes, pointing to an additional ionizing component. Here, we consider electrons and positrons from annihilating and decaying MeV DM particles, as well as Hawking radiation from evaporating PBHs, as possible contributors. We model transport driven by energy losses within the clouds. By comparing predicted ionization rates with observations, conservative constraints are set on the thermally averaged cross section $\langle\sigma v\rangle$, decay lifetime $\tau$ and PBH abundances $f_{PBH}$. The analysis assumes all the observed ionization comes from DM and adopts a 95% confidence level. Results show that, even in the most conservative case of local MCs such as L1551, these constraints are very close to the most competitive bounds from X-ray observations, while inner-Galaxy clouds like DRAGON or G1.4--1.8+87 provide stronger limits, sometimes improving X-ray and cosmological constraints. For sub-GeV DM, MCs exclude parameter space competitive with the one tested by NuSTAR, INTEGRAL, or Voyager, especially below $\sim$30 MeV. In the PBH case, asteroid-mass black holes are restricted to a low fraction of DM, with optimistic scenarios getting close to the strongest limits. This demonstrates the potential of MCs as a novel probe in indirect DM searches.

We construct a variety of bound states of Dirac magnetic monopoles in product $U(1)$ gauge theories, that make up a unit charge Dirac magnetic monopole of the unbroken $U(1)$ gauge group. The size of the bound states is determined by the balance between the repulsive magnetic Coulomb force of the unbroken $U(1)$ gauge group and the attractive force from the tension of the magnetic flux tubes of the broken $U(1)$ gauge groups. These bound states are extensions of the configuration first studied in arXiv:1608.06951. We dub this type of configurations ``Magnetic Monopole Molecules'' (MMMs). Besides some illustrative examples of MMMs made of a small number of constituent magnetic monopoles, a method to combine smaller MMMs to construct larger MMMs is presented. Implications for the weak gravity conjecture are also discussed.

In this work, we investigate gauge theories in two dimensions nonperturbatively using the Hamiltonian truncation approach. Working on a spatial interval and adopting the axial gauge, we remove all gauge field degrees of freedom and express the interacting Hamiltonian in the eigenbasis of the free Dirac theory, truncated at a finite energy. As a benchmark we analyse the Schwinger model, where our numerical spectra agree closely with the exact results from bosonization across a wide range of couplings, validating the construction of the Hamiltonian. We then generalize the formulation to nonabelian gauge groups and apply it to SU(3) gauge theory with a single massless Dirac fermion. These results demonstrate that gauge theories can be explored nonperturbatively using a truncated Hamiltonian that generates evolutions in ordinary time, offering a complementary alternative to lattice field theory.

Analyzing the transport coefficients and observables of a rotating QGP medium in kinetic theory framework with a novel approach to the collision integral

Comments:
32 pages, 9 figures
Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)
In the present work, we have studied how the rotation of the QGP medium affects the transport coefficients and observables in heavy ion collisions. For the noncentral collisions, although most of the angular momentum gets carried away by the spectators, there still remains a finite angular momentum with a finite range of angular velocity, which thus incites rotation in the produced matter. As a result, various properties of the QGP medium including its transport properties are most likely to be modulated by the rotation. We have calculated the transport coefficients and observables, such as the electrical conductivity, the thermal conductivity, the Knudsen number, the elliptic flow, the specific heat at constant pressure, the specific heat at constant volume, the trace anomaly, the thermal diffusion constant and the isothermal compressibility using the kinetic theory to see the effect of rotation on them. In particular, we have used the novel relaxation time approximation for the collision integral in the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation to derive the transport coefficients and compared them with their values in the relaxation time approximation within the kinetic theory approach in conjunction with the finite angular velocity. We have found that the emergence of angular velocity enhances the flow of charge and heat in the medium. Further, as compared to the relaxation time approximation, the electrical and the thermal conductivities have smaller values in the novel relaxation time approximation and these differences between the conductivities in the said approximations are more pronounced at high temperatures than at low temperatures. Furthermore, all the aforesaid observables are found to be sensitive to the rotation of the QGP medium.

Both collider searches and direct detections are promising approaches to probe fermionic dark matter. In this paper, we study signatures of four-fermion contact operators involving a dark fermion, an electron, and a quark pair. We show that the mono-electron production channel at hadron colliders can provide strong constraints. Associated productions of a charged electron with a photon/jet and missing energy are also studied. Using current LHC data at $\sqrt{s} = 13 \,\text{TeV}$, the lower bound on the energy scale of the (axial-)vector operator can reach 12 TeV for a massless dark fermion. This can be further improved to about 24 TeV at the HE-LHC with $\sqrt{s} = 25 \,\text{TeV}$ and a total luminosity of $20 \, \text{ab}^{-1}$. For direct detections, the signal operators can induce $\beta^\pm$ decays. For the induced $\beta^-$ decay, we find that the constraints are weaker than those from collider searches in almost all of the parameter space, and the accessible parameter space has already been excluded by current LHC data. In the case of a relatively heavy dark fermion (a few MeV), the induced $\beta^+$ decay is more sensitive than collider searches. Despite the advantage of collider searches that a much wider range of dark fermion masses can be investigated, they can also provide complementarity to direct detections.

We provide a comprehensive analysis of the Type-I Seesaw family of neutrino mass models, including the conventional type-I seesaw and its low-scale variants, namely the linear and inverse seesaws. We establish that all these models essentially correspond to a particular form of the type-I seesaw in the context of explicit lepton number violation. We then focus into the more interesting scenario of spontaneous lepton number violation, systematically categorizing all inequivalent minimal models. Furthermore, we identify and flesh out specific models that feature a rich majoron phenomenology and discuss some scenarios which, despite having heavy mediators and being invisible in processes such as $\mu \to e \gamma$, predict sizable rates for decays including the majoron in the final state.

We update the HOMER method, a technique to solve a restricted version of the inverse problem of hadronization -- extracting the Lund string fragmentation function $f(z)$ from data using only observable information. Here, we demonstrate its utility by extracting $f(z)$ from synthetic Pythia simulations using high-level observables constructed on an event-by-event basis, such as multiplicities and shape variables. Four cases of increasing complexity are considered, corresponding to $e^+e^-$ collisions at a center-of-mass energy of $90$ GeV producing either a string stretched between a $q$ and $\bar{q}$ containing no gluons; the same string containing one gluon $g$ with fixed kinematics; the same but the gluon has varying kinematics; and the most realistic case, strings with an unrestricted number of gluons that is the end-result of a parton shower. We demonstrate the extraction of $f(z)$ in each case, with the result of only a relatively modest degradation in performance of the HOMER method with the increased complexity of the string system.

The scattering of extremely energetic cosmic rays with both cosmic microwave background and extragalactic background light, can produce $\mathcal{O}(10^{18} \,{\rm eV})$ neutrinos, known as cosmogenic neutrinos. These neutrinos are the only messengers from the extreme cosmic accelerators that can reveal the origin of the most energetic cosmic rays. Consequently, much effort is being devoted to achieving their detection. In particular, the GRAND project aims to observe the $\nu_\tau$ and $\bar \nu_\tau$ components of the cosmogenic neutrino flux in the near future using radio antennas. In this work, we investigate how the detection of cosmogenic neutrinos by GRAND can be used to probe beyond the Standard Model physics. We identify three well-motivated scenarios which induce distinct features in the cosmogenic neutrino spectrum at Earth: neutrino self-interactions mediated by a light scalar ($\nu$SI), pseudo-Dirac neutrinos (PD$\nu$) and neutrinos scattering on ultra-light Dark Matter ($\nu$DM). We show these scenarios can be tested by GRAND, using 10 years of cosmogenic neutrino data, in a region of parameter space complementary to current experiments. For the $\nu$SI model,, we find that GRAND can constrain the coupling to $\nu_\tau$ in the range [$10^{-2},10^{-1}$] for a scalar with mass in the range 0.1 to 1 GeV. For PD$\nu$, we find that GRAND is sensitive to sterile-active mass squared splitting in the range [$10^{-15},10^{-13}$] ${\rm eV}^2$. Finally, for the $\nu$DM model, assuming a heavy mediator, GRAND can do substantially better than the current limits from other available data. These results rely on the fact that the actual cosmogenic flux is around the corner, not far from the current IceCube limit.

In view of the recent observation of $CP$-violation in bottom baryon decays, we explore $CP$-asymmetry relations in charmless four-body decays of bottom baryons featuring fully charged hadronic final states. Starting with a general effective Hamiltonian, we derive amplitude relations among various decay modes within the framework of $U$-spin symmetry. These relations lead to symmetry-based predictions for $CP$-violating rate asymmetries in $U$-spin conjugate decay channels. Furthermore, we demonstrate that all leading-order amplitude relations are violated once $U$-spin breaking effects are taken into account.

In this work, we systematically study gravitational wave (GW) production during both the inflationary and post-inflationary epochs. While inflationary GWs can be readily derived from tensor perturbations during inflation, post-inflationary GWs arise from a variety of processes during reheating and require detailed treatment for quantitative analysis. We consider four distinct production channels: $(i)$ pure inflaton annihilation, $(ii)$ graviton bremsstrahlung from inflaton decay, $(iii)$ radiation-catalyzed inflaton-graviton conversion, and $(iv)$ scattering among fully thermalized radiation particles. For each channel, we solve the corresponding Boltzmann equation to obtain the GW spectrum and derive a simple yet accurate analytical expression for it. By employing a consistent treatment of all production channels, our analysis yields for the first time the full spectrum of GWs produced during the inflationary and post-inflationary epochs. We find that, while inflationary GWs dominate at low frequencies, post-inflationary processes generally produce high-frequency GWs with considerably high energy densities that may significantly exceed that of inflationary GWs.

Analysis of three-body charmed $B$ meson decays $B \to {D}(V^* \to){V P}$

We systematically analyze the decays $B_{(s)} \to D_{(s)} (V^* \to)\, V\, P$, where $V^*$ represents a vector resonance ($\rho, \, \omega$ or $K^*$), and $V P$ denotes the final-state meson pairs $ \omega\, \pi$, $ \rho\, \pi$ and $ \rho \, K$. The intermediate subprocesses $B_{(s)} \to D_{(s)} V^*$ are calculated in the factorization-assisted topological-amplitude approach, while the intermediate resonant states $V^*$ are modeled using a relativistic Breit-Wigner distribution, subsequently decaying into $VP$ through strong interactions. We predict the off-shell effects of the ground-state resonances ($\rho,\, \omega, \, K^*$) in $B_{(s)} \to D_{(s)} (V^* \to )V P$. Our results show that the virtual contributions from $\rho \to \omega \, \pi$, $\omega \to \rho\, \pi$, and $K^* \to \rho\, K$ are crucial for these three-body decays, $B_{(s)} \to D_{(s)} V\, P$. In particular, the branching fractions arising from the $\rho$ and $\omega$ virtual effects can be comparable to the total decay rates of $B_{(s)} \to D_{(s)} \omega\, \pi$ and $B_{(s)} \to D_{(s)} \rho\, \pi$, respectively. Decays with branching fractions of order $10^{-6}-10^{-4}$ are expected to be measurable at Belle II and LHCb. Compared with previous perturbative QCD predictions for $B_{(s)} \to D_{(s)} (\rho \to)\, \omega\, \pi$, our results are consistent but exhibit higher precision.

Observations of $\gamma$-ray from blazars suggest the presence of magnetic fields in the intergalactic medium, which may require a primordial origin. Intense enough primordial magnetic fields can arise from theories of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking during the big bang, where supercooling is ended by a strongly first order phase transition. We consider theories involving new scalars and possibly vectors, including thermal particle dark matter candidates. Intense enough magnetic fields can arise if the reheating temperature after the phase transition is below a few TeV. The same dynamics also leaves testable primordial gravitational waves and possibly primordial black holes.

Neutrino oscillations in Ellis wormhole spacetime under and beyond the weak-field regime

Gravitational lensing is a powerful tool to probe compact astrophysical objects and the distribution of dark matter at large scales. As a counterpart of photons, lensed relativistic neutrinos could also be used to explore properties of curved spacetimes. In the present paper we consider neutrinos oscillations in the Ellis wormhole (WH) spacetime. We investigate the oscillations involving lensing effects with 2-flavor neutrinos under the weak-field approximation. In this case the flavor oscillation probabilities are sensitive to neutrino mass hierarchy, and the lightest neutrino mass. The influence of the Ellis WH on the coherence of neutrinos is also studied in the weak-field regime. We find no significant modification to the decoherence length from the lensing effect. To overcome the limit of the weak-field approximation where only small throats are considered for given geometrical parameters, we perform strict calculations to explore the throats effects on the 3-flavor neutrino oscillations. In the case of normal mass ordering, an interesting separation phenomenon in the oscillation curves appears in the special range of geometric parameter. In particular, we observe that CP violations in neutrino oscillations in the curved spacetime can be discriminated from the violation in the flat spacetime. Thus, in the strong-field regime, nontrivial spacetime information may be encoded in the CP violation of neutrinos.

Resonant leptogenesis in inverse see-saw framework with modular $S_4$ symmetry

High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)
We introduce a lepton mass generation and flavor mixing model, realized through a (2,3) inverse seesaw structure based on modular \( S_4 \) symmetry. The model employs modular forms to construct the lepton Yukawa couplings, significantly simplifies the construction by reducing redundant parameters. A detailed numerical analysis demonstrates consistency with current neutrino oscillation data, yielding specific outputs for the mixing angles and CP-violating phases. The Dirac CP phase is localized near \( \delta_{\rm CP} \sim 350^\circ \). It further predicts an effective Majorana mass \( |m_{ee}| \sim \mathcal{O}(10^{-3}) \,\text{eV} \), within the scope of upcoming experiments on neutrinoless double beta decay such as nEXO and AMoRE-II. The model also remains consistent with current bounds on charged lepton flavor violating processes from MEG and BaBar. We further explore resonant leptogenesis enabled by quasi-degenerate heavy neutrino states, and show that the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe can be successfully generated in this scenario. The combined treatment of low-energy observables and high-scale baryogenesis demonstrates the predictivity and testability of the modular \( S_4 \)-based ISS(2,3) framework.

We show that minimal, fermionic dark matter (DM) models in the $n$-dimensional representation of the weak force with zero hypercharge that make up 100% of the DM under the standard cosmological history are strongly excluded for $n < 9$. This includes the thermal wino, which we show is ruled out even allowing for DM core sizes up to $\sim$6.7 kpc with the preferred local DM density or $\sim$3.7 kpc in addition to the local DM density being half the preferred value, at less than $0.2$ GeV/cm$^3$. We reach these conclusions through dedicated searches with 14 years of Fermi gamma-ray data in the inner Galaxy between 30 GeV and 2 TeV for the continuum gamma-rays produced in the decays of unstable particles produced in DM annihilation and bound-state formation processes. We consider a variety of Milky Way DM profiles in our analyses, including those motivated by modern hydrodynamic cosmological simulations, and show that all the $n < 9$ minimal DM models are disfavored even under the most conservative assumptions for these density profiles. While wino, quintuplet ($n=5$), and $n = 7$ DM models are strongly disfavored by our analyses under the standard cosmology, we discuss how non-standard cosmological histories or DM sub-fractions could still allow for these particles to be realized in nature, with discovery opportunities at next-generation particle colliders and gamma-ray telescopes.

In this work, we perform a systematic investigation of ${K}^{(*)}{K}^{(*)}$ interactions within a one-boson-exchange this http URL framework incorporates both $S-D$ wave mixing and coupled-channel effects, with effective potentials retained up to order $\mathcal{O}(1/M^2)$. By solving the coupled channel Schrödinger equations, we can predict two double-strange molecular candidates: a $KK^*$ molecule with $I(J^P)=0(1^+)$ and a $K^*K^*$ molecule with $0(1^+)$. Our results also show that the recoil corrections play a crucial role in the formation of these two molecular candidates. Furthermore, the $S-D$ wave mixing effects contribute positively to the formation process. As a byproduct of this analysis, we extend our study to $K^{(*)}\bar{K}^{(*)}$ interactions with the same model. Our findings suggest that the $K\bar{K}^{*}$ states with $0(1^{+-}, 1^{++})$ and $K^{*}\bar{K}^{*}$ states with $0(0^{++}, 1^{+-}, 2^{++})$ can be promising molecular candidates. Additionally, we analyze the correlations between the constituent mesons, the resulting correlation functions provide additional support for our predictions of both double-strange and strangonium-like molecular states.

Dispersion relations of deeply virtual Compton scattering: investigating twist-4 kinematic power corrections

Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)
In this paper we include kinematic power corrections up to twist-four to the deeply virtual Compton scattering dispersion relation. We demonstrate that, both for (pseudo-)scalar and spin-$1/2$ targets, the formal expression of the $n$-subtracted leading-twist dispersion relations is preserved. However, the expression of the subtracted constants is modified by the kinematic powers. Importantly, the minimal-subtracted dispersion relation for the helicity-conserving amplitude, previously thought to depend only on the Polyakov-Weiss $D$-term, now also depends on the double distributions $F$ and $K$. These results are consistent with the ones obtained previously in the literature. Such a mixing may be critical for the Jefferson Lab kinematic range, as it is not suppressed for typical values of $t$ and $Q^{2}$ in the valence region. We therefore expect a strong impact on attempts to extract pressure forces from DVCS data.

Our computation is performed using modern techniques of reduction to Master Integrals and solving them with the differential equation method. We obtain explicit expressions for the electron-in-electron, positron-in-electron, photon-in-electron, electron-in-photon, and photon-in-photon distributions at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO). Cross-checks against one-loop results, existing two-loop calculations, and a recent soft-collinear effective theory (SCET) analysis of the electron structure functions are presented.

The question of what is the total entropy of the universe, how it compares to the maximal entropy of de Sitter space, and how it is distributed across the universe's components, bears considerable importance for a number of reasons. Here, we first update the computation of the entropy associated with various sectors of the observed universe, including in the diffuse cosmic and late-time gamma-ray and neutrino backgrounds, in baryonic matter both in diffuse components, in stars and stellar remnants, and in cosmic rays; we then update, crucially, the estimate of entropy in stellar-mass and super-massive black holes, whose abundance and mass function has come into increasingly sharp definition with recent observations and with the rapidly growing statistics of black-hole-black-hole mergers observed with gravity wave detectors. We also provide a new, corrected estimate of the potential entropy associated with a stochastic gravitational wave background, with dark sector radiations, and with several dark matter models. Finally, we utilize the similarly recently updated constraints on the abundance of hypothetical primordial black holes - black holes, that is, of non-stellar origin - to assess the maximal amount entropy they could store. We find that if supermassive primordial black holes exist, they can dominate the entropy budget of the universe consistently with current constraints on their abundance and mass function, to a level potentially not distant from the posited entropy associated with the cosmic event horizon of de Sitter spacetime. The same conclusion holds for certain dark sector models featuring a large number of dark degrees of freedom.

Using 20.3$~\rm fb^{-1}$ of $e^+e^-$ annihilation data collected at a center-of-mass energy of 3.773$~\rm GeV$ with the BESIII detector, we report an improved search for the radiative leptonic decay $D^+\to\gamma e^+\nu_e$. An upper limit on its partial branching fraction for photon energies $E_\gamma>10~\rm MeV$ was determined to be $1.2\times10^{-5}$ at 90\% confidence level; this excludes most current theoretical predictions. A sophisticated deep learning approach, which includes thorough validation and is based on the Transformer architecture, was implemented to efficiently distinguish the signal from massive backgrounds.

Recently, it was shown that in the absence of gravity there exist non-$O(4)$-symmetric instanton solutions with finite action beyond Coleman's instantons. In this paper, focusing on the false-vacuum decay in a single scalar field in flat Euclidean space, we provide a general discussion on $O(4)$-symmetric instantons that are singular at the true-vacuum bubble. We find that, for the action to remain finite without introducing a UV cutoff, the potential must be unbounded from below, thereby evading Coleman's theorem. We then consider two explicit examples of such instantons and perturbatively analyze the dynamics of small deformations around them. We find that one of them does not allow regular deformations, which indicates that the $O(4)$ symmetric solution still gives the minimum action, while the other one is found to allow regular deformations that cost no additional action at second order in perturbation. The latter example opens up the possibility of the existence of non-linear non-$O(4)$-symmetric solutions with lower action if we allow singular instantons with finite action.

Gravitational-wave (GW) observations of compact binaries have the potential to unlock several remarkable applications in astrophysics, cosmology, and nuclear physics through accurate measurements of the source luminosity distance and inclination. However, these parameters are strongly correlated when performing parameter estimation, which may hamper the enormous potential of GW astronomy. We comprehensively explore this problem by performing Bayesian inference on synthetic data for a network of current and planned second-generation GW detectors, and for the third-generation interferometer Einstein Telescope~(ET). We quantify the role of the network alignment factor, detector sensitivity, and waveform higher-order modes in breaking this degeneracy. We discuss the crucial role of the binary mass ratio: in particular, we find that ET can efficiently remove the error in the distance as long as the compact binary is asymmetric in mass.

Recent measurements from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), combined with Planck and DESI data, suggest a higher value for the spectral index $n_s$. This places Starobinsky inflation at the edge of the $2\sigma$ constraints for a number of e-folds $N_\star$ around $60$ when using the usual analytical approximations. We present refined predictions for Starobinsky inflation that go beyond the commonly used analytical approximations. By evaluating the model with these improved expressions, we show that for $N_\star \gtrsim 58$ it remains consistent with current observational constraints at the $2\sigma$ level. Additionally, we examine the implications of the ACT results for post-inflationary reheating parameters. Specifically, we find a lower bound on the effective equation of state parameter during reheating of approximately $\omega \gtrsim 0.462$; this excludes purely perturbative reheating, which leads to $\omega \simeq 0$. We also show that the reheating temperature is constrained to be $T_{\text{rh}} \lesssim 2 \times 10^{10}~\text{GeV}$, assuming $\omega \leq 1$. Furthermore, we find that the predictions for the spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio can lie within $1\sigma$ of the recent ACT constraints if the reheating temperature satisfies $4~\text{MeV} \lesssim T_{\text{rh}} \lesssim 10~\text{GeV}$ for $0.8 \lesssim \omega \leq 1$.

We study the $O(2N)$ symmetric Gross-Neveu model at finite density in the presence of a $U(1)$ chemical potential $h$ for a generic number $a \leq N-2$ of fermion fields. By combining perturbative quantum field theory, semiclassical large $N$, and Bethe ansatz techniques, we show that at finite $N$ two new dynamically generated scales $\Lambda_\mathrm{n}$ and $\Lambda_\mathrm{c}$ appear in the theory, governing the mass gap of neutral and charged fermions, respectively. Above a certain threshold value for $h$, $a$-fermion bound states condense and form an inhomogeneous configuration, which at infinite $N$ is a crystal spontaneously breaking translations. At large $h$, this crystal has mean $\Lambda_\mathrm{n}$ and spatial oscillations of amplitude $2\Lambda_\mathrm{c}$. The two scales also control the nonperturbative corrections to the free energy, resolving a puzzle concerning fractional-power renormalons and predicting new ones.

In this work, we study the charged hadron anisotropic flow coefficients $v_n$ (up to $n = 12$) using high-statistics event-by-event simulations of Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}} = 5.02$ and $5.36$~TeV, employing the IP-Glasma + MUSIC + UrQMD hybrid approach. The power spectra of anisotropic flow coefficients ($v_n\{2\}$ vs. $n$) are compared with the ALICE measurements from central to 50% centrality. To understand the various sources contributing to the high-order $v_n$ coefficients, we analyze the nonlinear mode coefficients for high-order anisotropic flow coefficients using different approximations and make comparisons with available measurements.

We perform the first quantum computation of parton distribution function (PDF) with a real quantum device by calculating the PDF of the lightest positronium in the Schwinger model with IBM quantum computers. The calculation uses 10 qubits for staggered fermions at five spatial sites and one ancillary qubit. The most critical and challenging step is to reduce the number of two-qubit gate depths to around 500 so that sensible results start to emerge. The resulting lightcone correlators have excellent agreement with the classical simulator result in central values, although the error is still large. Compared with classical approaches, quantum computation has the advantage of not being limited in the accessible range of parton momentum fraction $x$ due to renormalon ambiguity, and the difficulty of accessing non-valence partons. A PDF calculation with 3+1 dimensional QCD near $x=0$ or $x=1$ will be a clear demonstration of the quantum advantage on a problem with great scientific impact.

The fact that strange sea quarks are abundant in the nucleons, but with zero net strangeness, is of great importance for understanding the nature of matter condensed by the strong interaction, particularly in the context of the ``gigantic nucleus'' formed by the gravitational collapse of an evolved massive star. We hypothesize that the basic unit of bulk strong matter with the light-flavor symmetry of valence quarks is ``strangeon'', which is the counterpart of the nucleon found in atomic nuclei. In addition to strangeon stars (SnSs) with large baryon number of $A\approx 10^{57}$, strange nuggets (SnNs) with $A\gtrsim 10^{10}$ could also exist in the Universe. Both the SnS and the SnN are explained, with attention to their observational evidence.

A hallmark of the computational campaign in nuclear and particle physics is the lattice-gauge-theory program. It continues to enable theoretical predictions for a range of phenomena in nature from the underlying Standard Model. The emergence of a new computational paradigm based on quantum computing, therefore, can introduce further advances in this program. In particular, it is believed that quantum computing will make possible first-principles studies of matter at extreme densities, and in and out of equilibrium, hence improving our theoretical description of early universe, astrophysical environments, and high-energy particle collisions. Developing and advancing a quantum-computing based lattice-gauge-theory program, therefore, is a vibrant and fast-moving area of research in theoretical nuclear and particle physics.
These lecture notes introduce the topic of quantum computing lattice gauge theories in a pedagogical manner, with an emphasis on theoretical and algorithmic aspects of the program, and on the most common approaches and practices, to keep the presentation focused and useful. Hamiltonian formulation of lattice gauge theories is introduced within the Kogut-Susskind framework, the notion of Hilbert space and physical states is discussed, and some elementary numerical methods for performing Hamiltonian simulations are discussed. Quantum-simulation preliminaries and digital quantum-computing basics are presented, which set the stage for concrete examples of gauge-theory quantum-circuit design and resource analysis. A step-by-step analysis is provided for a simpler Abelian gauge theory, and an overview of our current understanding of the quantum-computing cost of quantum chromodynamics is presented in the end. Examples and exercises augment the material, and reinforce the concepts and methods introduced throughout.

We employ a model of nuclear structure that takes into account the quark substructure of the baryons to understand the behavior of static two-point correlation functions of meson fields in dense nuclear matter. We show that these correlation functions display ``moat'' regimes, where the inverse static correlation function is nonmonotonic in momentum space. This can have interesting consequences for the nature of nuclear matter, and it strengthens the possibility of a liquid-crystal phase for high densities.

Deuterons with different polarization states have distinct shapes for their wavefunctions. This offers a unique opportunity to experimentally control the initial-state collision geometry with the polarization of the light-ion targets in relativistic heavy-ion experiments. We study the charged hadron elliptic flow coefficients with respect to the polarization angle of deuterons in Pb + polarized deuteron collisions using a hydrodynamics + hadronic transport model. Hydrodynamic response to initial-state geometry predicts a distinct sign of $v_2$ correlated with the deuteron's polarization states, providing a clean test case for elucidating the collective origin in small collision systems.

The detection of primordial black holes (PBHs) would mark a major breakthrough, with far-reaching implications for early universe cosmology, fundamental physics, and the nature of dark matter. Gravitational wave observations have recently emerged as a powerful tool to test the existence and properties of PBHs, as these objects leave distinctive imprints on the gravitational waveform. Notably, there are no known astrophysical processes that can form sub-solar mass black holes, making their discovery a compelling signal of new physics. In addition to PBHs, we consider other exotic compact object (ECO) candidates-such as strange quark stars and boson stars-which can produce similar gravitational signatures and potentially mimic PBHs. In this work, we employ the Fisher matrix formalism to explore a broad parameter space, including binary masses, spins, and a variety of nuclear and quark matter equations of state. Our goal is to assess the ability of next-generation gravitational wave detectors-specifically Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope-to distinguish PBHs from ECOs, stellar BHs and neutron stars. We compute the maximum luminosity distances at which confident ($\geq 3\sigma$) detections of sub-solar masses or tidal effects are possible, providing quantitative benchmarks for PBH identification or exclusion under various observational scenarios. Our results indicate that next-generation detectors will be capable of probing sub-solar mass PBHs out to cosmological distances of $z \sim 3$. For heavier objects with masses up to $M \lesssim 2 M_\odot$, we show that PBHs can be distinguished from neutron stars via their lack of tidal effects up to redshifts of $z \sim 0.2$.

The nature of dark matter remains unknown, motivating the study of fuzzy/wave dark matter (FDM/$\psi$DM) and self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) as alternative frameworks to address small-scale discrepancies in halo profiles inferred from observations. This study presents a non-parametric reconstruction of the mass distribution of the previously-found, dark subhalo in the strong-lensing system JVAS B1938+666. Compared with the standard Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile, both SIDM and $\psi$DM ($m_{\psi}=1.32^{+0.22}_{-0.31}\times 10^{-22} \, \rm eV$) provide significantly better fits to the resulting density profile. Moreover, the SIDM model is favored over $\psi$DM with a Bayes factor of 14.44. The reconstructed density profile features a characteristic kiloparsec-scale core ($r_c \approx 0.5 \, \rm kpc$) with central density $\rho_c \approx 2.5\times 10^{7}\, \rm M_{\odot} \, kpc^{-3} $, exhibiting remarkable consistency with the core-halo mass scaling relations observed in Local Group dwarf spheroidals. These findings offer insights that may help address the core-cusp discrepancy in $\Lambda$CDM substructure predictions.

Title:
$A_β[E_β]$ in $^{37}$K decay: new physics with opposite $β$ helicity

By extending our analysis and simulations of our $^{37}$K $\beta$-decay data set to allow the $\beta$ asymmetry with respect to nuclear spin to vary with $\beta$ energy $E_{\beta}$, we have gained sensitivity to new physics that depends on a helicity factor for the $\beta$, $m_\beta/E_\beta$.
In particular, we constrain Lorentz scalar and tensor quark-lepton interaction strengths at a sensitivity complementary to the similar Fierz interference term in neutron $\beta$ decay.
Our result for that new physics is
$b_F$ = -0.0002 $\pm$ 0.024 (stat) $\pm$ 0.039 (syst),
consistent with the standard model electroweak interaction value $b_F=0$. We consider presently achieved complementarity to $\beta$-decay and particle physics experiments, along with projectable technical improvements to our method.

Title:
Method of regions for dual conformal integrals

We apply the method of regions to the evaluation of dual conformal integrals with small off-shellness. In contrast to conventional approach, where the separation of regions is performed via dimensional regularization breaking the dual conformal invariance (DCI), we use a sufficiently generic combination of dimensional and analytic regularizations which preserves the DCI. Within this regularization (dubbed as DCI regularization), the contribution of each region becomes DCI. We show that our method dramatically simplifies the calculations. As a demonstration, we calculate the slightly off-shell DCI pentabox integral up to power corrections. The contributions of all 32 regions appear to be expressible in terms of products/ratios of $\Gamma$-functions multiplied by some powers of DCI cross-ratios. Therefore, after removing the regularization, we obtain the final expression in terms of cross-ratios logarithms only. We have checked that our result for pentabox integral numerically agrees with the result of the recent Belitsky\&Smirnov paper [arXiv:2508.14298] which has essentially more complicated form.
