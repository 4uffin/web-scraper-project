Title:
Dark matter: red or blue?

Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE)
We report the first calculation of light scattering on heavy dark matter (DM) particles. We show that despite the fact that DM has no direct coupling to photons, the light-DM($\gamma\chi$) ($m_\chi \sim 1$ TeV) cross-section is non-vanishing, albeit small. The cross section, calculated within the Standard Model (SM) framework, is particularly large in the case of heavy Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMP). Combined with astrophysical observation, these results can constrain existing WIMP DM models in favor of lighter DM, $M_\chi<<M_{\mathrm{Planck}}$, (axions, composite DM, etc..) or non-weakly interacting pure gravitational DM. We also show that the energy dependence of light scattering on dark matter should make the DM colored - red in the case of weak-DM and blue for the gravitational-DM, when a white background light is passing through. Gravitational scattering of light on DM particles also leads to non-trivial polarization effects, which might be easier to detect than the deflection of light from the scattering on DM particles, $\gamma\chi\rightarrow\gamma\chi$.

With the forthcoming deployment of IceCube-Upgrade, unprecedented statistics of atmospheric neutrinos in the energy range (1-100) GeV will become available, providing a valuable opportunity to probe physics beyond the Standard Model in the neutrino sector. In this study, we calculate the sensitivity of the IceCube-Upgrade to sterile neutrinos with mass-squared splittings $\lesssim 1~{\rm eV}^2$. We demonstrate that, particularly due to the (1-10) GeV energy window, $\nu_\mu-\nu_s$ mixing angles as small as $\sim5^\circ$ can be probed by IceCube-Upgrade for all mass-squared splittings below $1~{\rm eV}^2$. Furthermore, we investigate the potential impact of a sterile neutrino state on the precision determination of standard atmospheric neutrino mixing parameters in the IceCube-Upgrade.

We investigate the origin of the unusually large electroweak (EW) radiative effects observed in the extraction of the spin-density matrix and related observables at colliders, focusing on leptonic Z-boson decays. We compute the Z-boson-decay spin-density matrix at next-to-leading order (NLO) and find that, while its analytic structure remains essentially unchanged with respect to leading order, the EW corrections induce a sizeable $-35\%$ shift in the spin-analysing-power parameter $\eta_\ell$. This effect alone accounts for the striking size of the corrections. For boosted Z bosons, we further show that the treatment of photon radiation in lepton-dressing algorithms significantly affects the extraction of spin-density-matrix coefficients at NLO and must be carefully controlled. To address these challenges, we propose a quantum tomography procedure that is applicable to any final state with one or more on-shell Z bosons that is robust under higher-order corrections. We illustrate its validity and limitations in ${\textrm{pp}} \to {\textrm{ZZ}} \to 4\ell$ and in heavy ($M_{\textrm{H}}>2 M_{\textrm{Z}}$) Higgs-boson decay ${\textrm{H}}\to {\textrm{ZZ}} \to 4\ell$.

Collider probes of baryogenesis with maximal CP asymmetry

We propose a novel collider probe of baryogenesis at TeV scale by measuring decay asymmetries into particle and anti-particle final states. Motivated by the idea of Dirac leptogenesis, we consider an extension of the standard model with new colored and $SU(2)_L$ singlet particles in such a way that the out-of-equilibrium decay of heavy colored fermions creates equal and opposite CP asymmetries in two sectors, prevented from equilibrating with each other. While the TeV scale viability of this mechanism requires a resonantly enhanced CP asymmetry, the latter also plays a crucial role leading to observable decay asymmetries in colliders. In addition to discussing conventional signatures of such heavy colored particles, namely, mono-jet plus missing transverse energy, displaced vertex, colored track at hadron colliders, we also show the unique possibility of measuring decay asymmetries via forward-backward and charge asymmetries at future muon colliders. In addition to being a verifiable TeV-scale baryogenesis scenario, the model also predicts a singlet scalar dark matter candidate consistent with the required thermal dark matter properties near the Higgs resonance.

Roles of $U(1)$ axial anomaly effects in cold and dense two-color QCD with $2+2$ flavors

We explore phase structures and hadron mass spectra in cold and dense two-color QCD with $2+2$ flavors where the sign problem disappears. We particularly focus on $U(1)$ axial anomaly effects. We employ an $N_f=2+2$ linear sigma model based on the $SU(8)$ Pauli-Gürsey symmetry to describe negative-parity as well as positive-parity hadrons, for which low-energy excitations are appropriately described particularly in the baryon superfluid phase with light diquark condensates. As a result, the strange chiral condensate is found to be enhanced in the superfluid phase owing to the flavor-mixing structure of $U(1)$ axial anomaly effects. We also confirm this enhancement by means of the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model. Besides, our present analysis predicts the existence of a novel superfluid phase where heavy diquarks condense in dense regime. The topological susceptibility with $2+2$ flavors from the viewpoints of the anomaly effects and chiral-symmetry restoration is investigated. Furthermore, we derive a complete inverse mass hierarchy for negative-parity diquarks with sufficient anomaly effects. Our findings are expected to provide future lattice simulations with useful information on flavor-symmetry violation from the $U(1)$ axial anomaly aspects in cold and dense two-color QCD medium.

Spectrum of Light Hexaquark States in Triquark-antitriquark Configuration

To understand the nature of $X(2075)$ and $X(2085)$ observed by the BESIII collaboration in the $p\bar{\Lambda}$ system, we systematically investigate the possibility that these states are compact hexaquark with triquark-antitriquark configurations for the first time. Within the framework of QCD sum rules, the mass spectrum and decay constants of such hexaquark states with quantum numbers $J^P=0^-, 0^+, 1^-, 1^+$ are studied. Consequently, six independent and nondegenerate hexaquark candidates are obtained, among which two $J^P = 1^-$ states exhibit masses consistent with $X(2075)$, while the two $J^P = 1^+$ states differ markedly from the mass of $X(2075)$ or $X(2085)$. The remaining two states with $J^P = 0^+$ and $0^-$ may serve as predictions for potential compact hexaquark configurations. Furthermore, the possible decay modes of these hexaquark states are analyzed, which could be the experimental signatures for their identification.

Kinetic Freeze-Out Properties from Transverse Momentum Spectra of kaon, Pion, and (anti-)proton production in U+U collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 193 GeV

High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)
In the framework of the multi-source thermal model employing the Tsallis distribution, the transverse momentum distributions of kaon, pion, and (anti -)proton production in U+U collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 193 GeV with varying centrality are investigated. The transverse momentum spectra are appropriately characterized. The dependencies of parameters (average transverse momenta, effective temperature, and entropy index) on event centrality are determined. It is observed that the q parameters increase as the average number of particles participating in the collisions rises, which implies that the nuclear stopping degree elevates with the increase of collision centrality. The T value remains fundamentally consistent for the same particle under different collision parameters, suggesting that the kinetic freezing temperature of particle ejection in this collision system is independent of the collision parameters.

Baryons as linked vortices in QCD matter with isospin asymmetry

We investigate a baryonic structure in low-energy QCD via a model-independent way using the chiral perturbation theory at the leading order, in the presence of the baryon chemical potential $\mu_B$, the isospin chemical potential $\mu_I$, and the electromagnetic coupling. For such a scenario in the chiral limit, it has been known that the neutral pion winds like in the chiral soliton lattice, confined within an Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen (ANO) vortex of the charged pions. This structure undergoes a drastic transformation when the pion mass is introduced, i.e., both charged and neutral pions condense in the bulk, allowing two distinct types of vortices: the charged pions constitute a local ANO-like vortex, while the neutral pion configures a global vortex which is further attached to a domain wall also known as the chiral soliton. Remarkably, the ANO vortex forms a topological linking with the closed global vortex line, when $\mu_B$ exceeds its critical value as a function of $\mu_I$. The linking number has the physical meaning of the baryon number in view of the Wess-Zumino-Witten term. In this sense, the linked configuration realizes a stable Skyrmion-type solution, but innovatively without the Skyrme term. We therefore propose a novel phase of dense baryonic matter comprised of such vortices, which shall play a role in the low-energy QCD phase diagram.

High intensity muon beams open new avenues for exploring physics beyond the Standard Model. In this paper, we propose a muonium-based experiment to search for ultralight axions dark matter through resonant quantum transitions between hyperfine states. Combining theoretical calculation with simulation results, we show that a muon beam with a realistic intensity of $10^5 \rm /s$ in the $\mathcal{O}(10~\text{keV})$ energy range could improve constraints on the axion-muon coupling by {up to seven orders of magnitude compared with existing muon $g-2$ limit, over the axion mass range $10^{-15}$ eV$-10^{-5}$ eV}. These results establish muonium spectroscopy currently under construction in Huizhou, as a powerful new probe of physics beyond the Standard Model.

We study confinement and deconfinement in dense two color QCD by analyzing the dynamics of thermal quarks and gluons. The Polyakov loop is used as a probe of the relevant thermal excitations, distinguishing quark and hadron dominated regimes in dense matter. To describe the Polyakov loop, we adopt both lattice informed phenomenological models and the massive Yang Mills framework. After calibrating these models at zero density, we investigate in medium modifications of the Polyakov loops and gluon propagators at finite temperature and density. Diquark gaps control the screening at zero temperature, whereas the screening due to thermal quarks is sensitive to the Polyakov loop. Inclusion of the Polyakov loop helps to reproduce lattice data at low temperature, suggesting that thermal excitations are predominantly hadronic rather than uncorrelated quarks.

Scalaron dark matter dynamics: effects of Higgs non-minimal coupling to gravity

One of the key features of the $R^2$-gravity is the embedding of a scalar field, scalaron, into the gravity sector. The scalaron interacts with the Standard Model (SM) matter fields through Planck-suppressed couplings. If the scalaron serves as a viable dark matter (DM) candidate, it can account for the lack of evidence of DM interactions beyond gravity in experimental and observational probes to date. The realization of the scalaron, as a cold DM candidate, depends on an induced trilinear interaction with the SM Higgs, despite its suppressed coupling strength. Here, we introduce a Higgs non-minimal coupling to gravity that additionally contributes to the induced trilinear interaction with its existing competing part, originated from the $R^2$-gravity. We study the interplay between these two contributions in the early universe, which determines both the initial conditions and evolution of the scalaron, leading to cold DM behavior at a later epoch. The trilinear interaction vanish identically for certain combinations of the Higgs non-minimal coupling and the scalaron mass, thereby setting the scalaron density through misalignment mechanism, similar to axions. Consequently, we find that the observed DM relic density is obtained for a scalaron mass between $1.38$ keV and $0.7$ MeV. The lower limit on the mass stems from the LHC constraints on the Higgs non-minimal coupling, whereas the upper bound arises from INTEGRAL/SPI limits on the excess gamma-ray flux from possible scalaron decays to two photons.

$Λ_{c}(2910)$ and $Λ_{c}(2940)$ productions in $p \bar{p}$ annihilation and $K^{-}p$ scattering processes

High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)
In this work, we investigate the productions of $\Lambda_{c}(2910)$ and $\Lambda_{c}(2940)$ in the $p \bar{p} \rightarrow \bar{\Lambda}_{c} D^{0} p$, $K^{-}p \rightarrow D^{-}_{s} D^{0} p$, and $K^{-}p \rightarrow D^{\ast-}_{s} D^{0} p$ processes by utilizing an effective Lagrangian approach, where both $\Lambda_{c}(2910)$ and $\Lambda_{c}(2940)$ are considered as $D^{\ast}N$ molecular states with $J^{P}=1/2^{-}$ and $3/2^{-}$, respectively. The cross sections and $D^0 p$ invariant mass distributions at exemplified center-of-mass energy for the involved processes are estimated. At $\sqrt{s}=10$ $\mathrm{GeV}$, our estimations indicate that the cross sections for $p \bar{p} \rightarrow \bar{\Lambda}_{c} D^{0} p$, $K^{-}p \rightarrow D^{-}_{s} D^{0} p$, and $K^{-}p \rightarrow D^{\ast-}_{s} D^{0} p$ processes are $(2.1^{+5.6}_{-1.6})$ nb, $(2.2^{+5.9}_{-1.7})$ nb, and $(0.6^{+1.6}_{-0.4})$ nb, respectively, where the uncertainties are resulted from the variation of model parameter. Furthermore, Our estimations of the $D^{0}p$ invariant mass spectra reveal that the peak structure around 2.9 GeV primarily originates from $\Lambda_c(2910)$ across all three processes, however the contributions from $\Lambda_c(2940)$ makes the structure asymmetric. It is expected that the total cross sections and the $D^0 p$ invariant mass distributions estimated in the present work can be tested by future experiments at $\mathrm{\bar{P}ANDA}$ and J-PARC.

Impact of anisotropy on QCD phase structure and transport coefficients of quark matter

High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)
Employing the Polyakov chiral SU(3) mean field (PCQMF) model, we investigate how momentum-space anisotropy, characteristic of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions (uRHIC), impacts the thermodynamic behavior and transport coefficients of strongly interacting quark matter. The momentum anisotropy is introduced via a small deformation in the momentum distribution, quantified by a spheroidal parameter $\xi$, which deforms the distribution functions and captures anisotropic effects to linear order. The PCQMF model captures key non-perturbative aspects of QCD, like chiral symmetry breaking, deconfinement dynamics through Polyakov loop potential, and is extended here to accommodate momentum-space anisotropy. We compute the modifications induced by momentum-space anisotropy to key thermodynamic observables including pressure $p$, energy density $\epsilon$, entropy density $s$, speed of sound squared $c_s^2$, and specific heat $c_v$, alongside key transport coefficients, such as shear viscosity $\eta$, bulk viscosity $\zeta_b$, and electrical conductivity $\sigma_{el}$. These coefficients are derived using the relativistic Boltzmann equation (RBE) under the relaxation time approximation (RTA). We find that even a weak anisotropy can lead to significant modifications in the thermodynamic response and transport behavior of quark matter. This underscores the importance of including momentum anisotropy for realistic modeling of the QCD medium across all energy regimes, from current studies at RHIC and LHC to future explorations of the high-density frontier at FAIR, NICA, and J-PARC.

We investigate the possibility of using the cosmic gravitational focusing (CGF) to probe the minor light dark matter (DM) component whose mass is in the range of $(0.1 \sim 100)$\,eV. Being a purely gravitational effect, the CGF offers a mode-independent probe that is complementary to the existing ways such as Lyman-$\alpha$ and $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$. Such effect finally leads to a dipole density distribution that would affect the galaxy formation and hence can be reconstructed with galaxy surveys such as DESI. Both the free-streaming and clustering limits have been studied with analytical formulas while the region in between is bridged with interpolation. We show the projected sensitivity at DESI with the typical phase space distribution of a freeze-in DM scenario as illustration.

Plasma lens with frequency-dependent dispersion measure effects on fast radio bursts
Yu-Bin Wang, Xia Zhou, Abdusattar Kurban
Subjects:
High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)
Radio signals propagating through inhomogeneous plasma media deviate from their original paths, producing frequency-dependent magnification effects. In this paper, after reviewing the classical plasma-lensing theory, we have found a fundamental contradiction: the classical model assumes that the distribution of lensing plasma medium is related to the frequency-independent image position; however, our analysis demonstrates that both the image position ($\theta(\nu)$) and dispersion measure (DM$(\nu)$) are inherently frequency-dependent when signals traverse a structured plasma medium.
We have been able to resolve this paradox by developing a framework that explicitly incorporates frequency-dependent dispersion measures (DMs) following power-law relationships ($\rm DM\propto \nu^\gamma$). Our analysis shows that the signal magnification decreases systematically with decreasing frequency, offering a plausible explanation for the frequency-dependent peak flux densities observed in fast radio bursts (FRBs), particularly in the case of the repeating FRB 180814.J0422+73. Our results suggest these FRBs could originate from the magnetized compact star magnetospheres. By considering these plasma-lensing effects on the sub-pulses of an FRB across different frequencies, we have the ability to more accurately investigate the intrinsic properties of FRBs via precise measurements of radio signals.

Geometric Building Blocks of Effective Field Theory Amplitudes

On-shell amplitudes are invariant under field redefinitions. Nonderivative field redefinitions have a natural interpretation as coordinate transformations on the target manifold. General field redefinitions, which may involve derivatives, can be viewed as coordinate transformations on the field configuration manifold. We present a unified perspective for the geometry of both the target manifold and the field configuration manifold for scalar effective field theories. In both cases, we identify vertices that can be used to build the tree-level amplitudes, with the property that they transform covariantly in the vacuum and on-shell limits. We identify a choice of metric on the field configuration manifold, for which amplitude expressions on the target manifold can be easily reproduced from their counterparts on the field configuration manifold. This clarifies the relation between the well-established framework of field space geometry and recent proposals for functional geometry.

We compute tree-level $n$-point scattering amplitudes in scalar field theories in terms of geometric invariants on a fibre bundle. All 0- and 2-derivative interactions are incorporated into a metric on this bundle. The on-shell amplitudes can be efficiently pieced together from covariant Feynman rules, and we present a general closed formula for obtaining the $n$-point amplitude in this way. The covariant Feynman rules themselves can be derived using a generalization of the normal coordinate expansion of the fibre bundle metric. We demonstrate the efficiency of this approach by computing the covariant Feynman rules up to $n=10$ points, from which one can obtain the full amplitudes using our general formula. The formalism offers a prototype for obtaining geometric amplitudes in theories with higher-derivative interactions, by passing from the fibre bundle to its jet bundles.

Axion-like particles (ALPs), hypothetical pseudoscalar particles that couple to photons, are among the most actively investigated candidates for new physics beyond the Standard Model. Their interaction with gamma rays in the presence of astrophysical magnetic fields can leave characteristic, energy-dependent modulations in observed spectra. Capturing such subtle features requires precise statistical inference, but standard likelihood-based methods often fall short when faced with complex models, large number of nuisance parameters and limited analytical tractability. In this work, we investigate the application of simulation-based inference (SBI), specifically Truncated Marginal Neural Ratio Estimation (TMNRE), to constrain ALP parameters using simulated observations from the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO). We model the gamma-ray emission from the active galactic nucleus NGC 1275, accounting for photon-ALP mixing, extragalactic background light (EBL) absorption, and the full CTAO instrument response. Leveraging the Swyft framework, we infer posteriors for the ALP mass and coupling strength and demonstrate its potential to extract meaningful constraints on ALPs from future real gamma-ray data with CTAO.

We study numerically the small-$x$ behaviour of the nuclear gluon distribution function $ G^A(x,Q^2)$ at next-to-leading order (NLO) approximation of the Gribov-Levin-Ryskin-Mueller-Qiu, Zhu-Ruan-Shen (GLR-MQ-ZRS) nonlinear equation and quantify the impact of gluon recombination in the kinematic range of $x \le 10^{-2}$ and $Q^2 \ge 5 \text{GeV}^2$ respectively. The results are comparable to the Rausch-Guzey-Klasen (RGK) [this http URL, this http URL and this http URL, Phys. Rev. D 107, 054003 (2023)] nuclear gluon distributions and the nCTEQ15 parametrization at the corresponding $Q^2$ values. Using the solutions of $ G^A(x,Q^2)$ in the framework of the nonlinear GLR-MQ-ZRS evolution equation, the linear and nonlinear behavior of the charm structure functions of nuclei per nucleon $F^{c\bar{c}-A}_2(x,Q^2)$ and $F^{c\bar{c}-A}_L(x,Q^2)$ are considered. The results reveal that nonlinear corrections play an important role in charm nuclear reduced cross sections at small-$ x$ and low $Q^2$ values. The computed results are compared with experimental data from the H1 and ZEUS Collaborations.

The presence of $\alpha$ clustered structures in light nuclei can enhance the initial spatial anisotropies in relativistic nuclear collisions relative to those arising from nuclei with uniform density distributions. Thus, observables that are strongly sensitive to the initial geometry can be a more efficient probe of the clustered structures than observables dominated by final state dynamics. We investigate the collisions of $\alpha$ clustered oxygen nuclei at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=7$A TeV at the LHC using the GLISSANDO initial state model along with the MUSIC event-by-event hydrodynamical framework. The tetrahedral $\alpha$ clustered structure of $^{16}$O leads to significantly larger initial triangular eccentricity $\epsilon_3$ than collisions with uniform density distributions especially in the most central events. The spatial eccentricity $\epsilon_2$ is found to be relatively less sensitive to the initial state clustered structure. The production of thermal photons is estimated to be only marginally influenced by clustering for both central as well as peripheral collisions. In contrast, the photon triangular flow coefficient $v_3(p_T)$ is strongly affected by initial state clustering resulting in substantially larger values in both central and peripheral collisions. An experimental determination of photon anisotropic flow together with the ratios of flow coefficients in $^{16}$O+$^{16}$O collisions therefore expected to provide valuable insight into the possible clustered structure in light nuclei and also to constrain parameters in theoretical modeling.

Cosmic rays reaching the atmosphere of an astrophysical object produce showers of secondary particles that may then scape into space. Here we obtain the flux of gammas and neutrinos of energy $E>10$ GeV emited by the Sun, Jupiter and Earth. We show that, while the solar magnetic field induces an albedo flux of gammas from all the points in the Sun's surface, the dipolar magnetic field in the planets implies gammas only from the very peripheral region. Neutrinos, in contrast, can cross these objects and emerge from any point in their surface. The emission from these astrophysical objects is above the diffuse flux from cosmic ray interactions with the interstellar medium and has a distinct spectrum and gamma to neutrino ratio.

Pion production in heavy-ion collisions at intermediate energies provides an important probe of the collision dynamics and nuclear matter equation of state, especially the high-density behavior of the symmetry energy. Using the lattice Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck transport model with a recently developed nuclear effective interaction based on the so-called N5LO Skyrme pseudopotential, we investigate the effects of the momentum dependence of nucleon mean-field potentials on the pion production in Au+Au collisions at a beam energy of $1.23$ GeV/nucleon. We find that a stronger momentum dependence, for which the nucleon mean-field potentials increase faster with momentum, generally suppresses pion production. This feature can be understood in terms of the nucleon momentum fractionation effect, namely, a stronger momentum dependence can reduce the relative fraction of high-momentum nucleons in heavy-ion collisions, thereby suppressing the production of $\Delta$ resonances and pions.

When a vortex electron with an orbital angular momentum (OAM) enters a magnetic field, its quantum state is described with a nonstationary Laguerre-Gaussian (NSLG) state rather than with a stationary Landau state. A key feature of these NSLG states is oscillations of the electron wave packet's root-mean-square (r.m.s.) radius, similar to betatron oscillations. Classically, such an oscillating charge distribution is expected to emit photons. This raises a critical question: does this radiation carry away OAM, leading to a loss of the electron's vorticity? To investigate this, we solve Maxwell's equations using the charge and current densities derived from an electron in the NSLG state. We calculate the total radiated power and the angular momentum of the emitted field, quantifying the rate at which a vortex electron loses its energy and OAM while propagating in a longitudinal magnetic field. We find both the radiated power and the angular momentum losses to be negligible indicating that linear accelerators (linacs) appear to be a prominent tool for maintaining vorticity of relativistic vortex electrons and other charged particles, at least in the quasi-classical approximation.

Anomalously slow coarsening in a dilute two-dimensional (2d) superfluid -- associated with a non-thermal fixed point in the closed system's universal dynamics and driven by three-vortex collisions which initiate vortex-pair annihilations -- is found to exhibit spatial scaling characteristics of Kraichnan-Kolmogorov turbulence. During a universal interval, when the characteristic length scale related to the inter-defect distance grows as $\ell_\text{v}\sim t^{\,\beta}$, with $\beta\approx1/5$, moments of the superfluid velocity circulation around an area of extent $r$ scale as predicted by classical turbulence theory, $\Gamma^{p}(r)\sim r^{4p/3}$. Intermittency corrections seen for higher values of $p$ are found to be consistent with values measured for fully developed, classical turbulence. Hence, we link the decaying quantum turbulence cascade in a closed superfluid to universal dynamics close to a non-thermal fixed point. The decay exponent $\beta$ clearly deviates from values known for classical systems.

The Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND) is a proposed multi-messenger observatory of ultra-high-energy (UHE) particles of cosmic origin. Its main goal is to find the long-sought origin of UHE cosmic rays by detecting large numbers of them and the secondary particles created by their interaction -- gamma rays, and, especially, neutrinos. GRAND will do so using large arrays of radio antennas that look for the radio signals emitted by the air showers initiated by the interactions of the UHE particles in the atmosphere. Since 2023, three small-scale prototype GRAND arrays have been in operation: GRAND@Nançay in France, GRAND@Auger in Argentina, and GRANDProto300 in China. Together, their goal is to validate the detection principle of GRAND under prolonged field conditions, achieving efficient, autonomous radio-detection of air showers. We describe the hardware, software, layout, and operation of the GRAND prototypes and show the first radio spectra measured by them. Despite challenges, the successful operation of the prototypes confirms that the GRAND instrumentation is apt to address the goals of the experiment and lays the groundwork for its ensuing stages.

Ultralight axion-like particles are well-motivated relics that might compose the cosmological dark matter and source anomalous time-dependent magnetic fields. We report on terrestrial bounds from the Noble And Alkali Spin Detectors for Ultralight Coherent darK matter (NASDUCK) collaboration on the coupling of axion-like particles to neutrons and protons. The detector uses nuclei of noble-gas and alkali-metal atoms and operates in the Spin-Exchange Relaxation-Free~(SERF) regime, achieving high sensitivity to axion-like dark matter fields. Conducting a month-long search, we cover the mass range of $1.4\times 10^{-12}$~eV/$c^2$ to $2\times 10^{-10}$~eV/$c^2$ and provide limits which supersede robust astrophysical bounds, and improve upon previous terrestrial constraints by over two orders of magnitude for many masses within this range for protons, and up to two orders of magnitude for neutrons. These are the first reliable terrestrial bounds reported on the coupling of protons with axion-like dark matter, covering an unexplored terrain in its parameter space.

For the first time, we comprehensively examine the potential of a neutral-current interaction of reactor neutrino with $^{13}$C emitting a 3.685 MeV photon to identify the origin of the 5 MeV bump in reactor antineutrino spectra observed through the inverse beta decay (IBD) process. This anomaly may be due to new physics, reactor antineutrino flux inaccuracies, or IBD systematics. The 3.685 MeV photon released during the de-excitation of $^{13}$C$^\ast$ to its ground state is observable in liquid scintillator detectors. Remarkably, we confirm the powerfulness of our proposal by completely ruling out a new physics scenario explaining the bump from the existing NEOS data. We also explore the potential of current and forthcoming experiments, including solar neutrino studies at JUNO, pion and muon decay-at-rest experiments at OscSNS, and isotope decay-at-rest studies at Yemilab, to measure the cross-section precisely enough to distinguish the expected bump and the theoretical flux models via our channel. Additionally, we propose a novel method to track the time evolution of reactor isotopes by analyzing the $^{13}$C signal, which yields critical insights into the contributions of $^{235}$U and $^{239}$Pu to the bump, acting as a robust tool.

It has long been established that axions could have been produced within the nascent proto-neutron-star formed following the type II supernova SN1987A, escaped the star due to their weak interactions, and then converted to gamma-rays in the Galactic magnetic fields; the non-observation of a gamma-ray flash coincident with the neutrino burst leads to strong constraints on the axion-photon coupling for axion masses $m_a \lesssim 10^{-10}$ eV. In this work we use SN1987A to constrain higher mass axions, all the way to $m_a \sim 10^{-3}$ eV, by accounting for axion production from the Primakoff process, nucleon bremsstrahlung, and pion conversion along with axion-photon conversion on the still-intact magnetic fields of the progenitor star. Moreover, we show that gamma-ray observations of the next Galactic supernova, leveraging the magnetic fields of the progenitor star, could detect quantum chromodynamics axions for masses above roughly 50 $\mu$eV, depending on the supernova. We propose a new full-sky gamma-ray satellite constellation that we call the GALactic AXion Instrument for Supernova (GALAXIS) to search for such future signals along with related signals from extragalactic neutron star mergers.

Machine learning tagged boosted dark photon: A signature of fermionic portal matter at the LHC

We use a Hybrid Deep Neural Network (HDNN) to identify a boosted dark photon jet as a signature of a heavy vector-like fermionic portal matter (PM) connecting the visible and the dark sectors. In this work, the fermionic PM, which mixes only with the Standard Model (SM) third-generation up-type quark, predominantly decays into a top quark and a dark photon pair. The dark photon then $promptly$ decays to a pair of standard model fermions via the gauge kinetic mixing. We have analyzed two different final states, namely, (i) exactly one tagged dark photon and exactly one tagged top quark jet, and (ii) at least two tagged dark photons and at least one tagged top quark jet at the 13 and 14 TeV LHC center of mass energies. Both these final states receive significant contributions from the pair and single production processes of the top partner. The rich event topology of the signal processes, $i.e.$, the presence of a boosted dark photon and top quark jet pair, along with the fact that the invariant mass of the system corresponds to the mass of the top partner, help us to significantly suppress potential SM backgrounds. We have shown that one can set a $2\sigma$ exclusion limit of $\sim 2.3$ TeV on the top partner mass with $\sin\theta_L=0.1$ and assuming $100\%$ branching ratio of the top partner in the final state with exactly one tagged dark photon and exactly one tagged top quark jet at the 14 TeV LHC center of mass energy assuming 300 fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity.

Linear Standard Model (SM) extensions, defined as new particles that can couple linearly to SM fields, form a motivated and finite set of simplified models for exploring phenomenology Beyond the SM (BSM). Heavy BSM particles may be integrated out to obtain their low-energy effects in the SM Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) parametrised by the Wilson coefficients of higher-dimensional operators. We compute and map the dimension-6 SMEFT operator structure of all scalar and fermion linear SM extensions up to one-loop order, thus extending the existing tree-level dictionary of results. Explicit analytic matching expressions for the Wilson coefficients are provided as both Python and Mathematica code in a GitHub repository accessible through links embedded in our main table for each coefficient and within a Python package. We apply our map to highlight the sensitivity to heavy new physics of a $Z$-pole run at a future Tera-$Z$ factory; at one loop, with unit couplings, all linear SM extensions can be indirectly probed by electroweak precision measurements up to $\mathcal{O}(10)$ TeV.

We obtain novel constraints on new scalar fields interacting with Standard Model fermions through Lorentz-violating couplings, bridging searches for scalar particles and Lorentz-symmetry tests. These constraints arise from torsion-balance experiments, magnetometer searches, and an excessive energy loss in Red Giant stars. Torsion-balance experiments impose stringent constraints, benefitting from large macroscopic sources including the Sun and Earth. Magnetometer-based searches, which detect pseudo-magnetic fields through spin precession, offer additional limiting power to low-mass scalar fields. Meanwhile, observations of Red Giant stars place strong limits on additional energy loss mechanisms, extending these constraints to higher scalar mass ranges and a wider range of Lorentz-violating couplings. Combining data from laboratory experiments and astrophysical observations, this approach strengthens constraints on Lorentz-violating interactions and paves the way for future investigations into physics beyond the Standard Model.

The role of unitarisation on dark-matter freeze-out via metastable bound states

Subjects:
High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)
In many Abelian and non-Abelian theories, standard calculations of radiative bound-state formation violate partial-wave unitarity - even at arbitrarily small couplings - when capture into excited states is considered. Recent work demonstrated that unitarity can be restored by the proper resummation of squared inelastic processes in the self-energy of the incoming state. We examine how unitarisation affects dark-matter thermal decoupling, given that the formation and decay of metastable dark-matter bound states are critical in determining the relic abundance, especially for multi-TeV dark matter. We consider an Abelian model featuring bound-state formation via emission of a light scalar that carries a conserved charge, whose dynamics also emulates relevant aspects of non-Abelian theories. Incorporating capture into excited states, we show that, without proper treatment, unitarity violation is so severe as to prevent freeze-out. Resumming the squared bound-state formation processes restores unitarity and ensures freeze-out, while capture into excited levels still significantly depletes dark matter. We further discuss the impact of higher partial waves, both within and beyond the present model. Finally, we point out the intriguing possibility of late dark-matter decoupling that can affect structure formation.

Observations of $\gamma$-ray from blazars suggest the presence of magnetic fields in the intergalactic medium, which may require a primordial origin. Intense enough primordial magnetic fields can arise from theories of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking during the big bang, where supercooling is ended by a strongly first order phase transition. We consider theories involving new scalars and possibly vectors, including thermal particle dark matter candidates. Intense enough magnetic fields can arise if the reheating temperature after the phase transition is below a few TeV. The same dynamics also leaves testable primordial gravitational waves and possibly primordial black holes.

We introduce a novel end-to-end framework for jet reconstruction in high-energy collider events, leveraging the efficiency and long-range modeling capabilities of the Mamba architecture. Our model unifies instance segmentation, classification, and kinematic regression into a single multi-task learning system, enabling a sophisticated multi-level reconstruction that simultaneously identifies primary heavy jets ($t$, $H$, $W/Z$) and their constituent sub-jets. To facilitate supervised learning for this complex task, we develop a novel method for assigning final-state hadrons to their ancestor colored partons using a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming solver, which generates high-fidelity ground-truth labels. The model achieves high classification accuracy, with an Average Precision score of 0.569 for $W/Z$-jets and 0.568 for $b$-jets, and shows exceptional precision in kinematic reconstruction. Furthermore, we show that the model not only maintains stable performance in high-pileup environments but also successfully reconstructs the mass peaks of beyond the standard model particles. This work presents a powerful and versatile new tool for comprehensive event reconstruction at the LHC.

Within the hypothesis of the dark-matter origin of the excess in $B\to K M_X$ decays over the standard-model expectation, observed by Belle-II, we show that: (i) Scalar- and vector-medator scenarios may be unambiguously discriminated by measuring the differential distributions in $B\to K M_X$ and $B\to K^* M_X$ decays. (ii) Combining the available data on $\Gamma(B\to K M_X)$ and the upper limit on $\Gamma(B\to K^* M_X)$ provides a tight constraint on the vector mediator mass $M_V\lesssim 3$ GeV. At the same time, no constraints on the scalar-mediator mass are imposed by these data. (iii) Both scalar- and vector-mediator scenarios allow a good description of the differential distributions in $B\to K M_X$ measured by Belle-II and an extraction of dark-model parameters within both scenarios.

Multiple dispersive bounds. I) An improved z-expansion

We propose the implementation of two novel ingredients in the standard $z$-expansion of hadronic form factors, commonly referred to as the Boyd-Grinstein-Lebed (BGL) approach [1-4]. The first new ingredient is the explicit addition of a unitarity filter applied to a given known set of input data for the hadronic form factors. This further constraint is not usually taken into account in the phenomenological applications of the BGL $z$-expansion. We show that it brings to a formulation of the BGL approach fully equivalent to the Dispersion Matrix (DM) method [5], which describes hadronic form factors in a completely model-independent and non-perturbative way. The second key ingredient is represented by the introduction of suitable kernel functions in the evaluation of unitarity bounds, leading to the application of multiple dispersive bounds to hadronic form factors, whenever data and/or (non-)perturbative techniques allow to do so. This idea may be useful for the investigation of many physical processes, from the analysis of the electromagnetic form factors of mesons and baryons to the study of weak semileptonic decays of hadrons. An explicit numerical application will be presented in the companion paper [6], where the effects of sub-threshold branch-cuts are analyzed.

We apply the general framework of multiple dispersive bounds, firstly discussed in the companion paper [1], to the study of sub-threshold branch-cuts. We propose the simultaneous application of a double dispersive bound as a proper way to take into account unitarity constraints within phenomenological analyses of hadronic form factors in the presence of sub-threshold branch-cuts. Accordingly, the standard $z$-expansion of hadronic form factors, commonly referred to as the Boyd-Grinstein-Lebed approach [2-5], is modified by including simultaneously the dispersive bounds related to the pair-production and to the sub-threshold regions. For the latter one the effects of above-threshold poles are described through a new resonance model and the possible choices of the outer function outside the pair-production region are discussed. A detailed numerical analysis of the experimental data or lattice QCD results in the spacelike region for the charged kaon form factor is presented as a direct application of the procedure of double dispersive bound. The comparison with other methodologies present in literature and with the $z$-expansion based on the single, total dispersive bound clearly shows that the $z$-expansion including the double dispersive bound provides the most precise extrapolation at large momentum transfer as well as the most stable results with respect to the choice of the outer function outside the pair-production region.

In this paper, we reinvestigate the Starobinsky inflation and its reheating features after the ACT results. To make the Starobinsky model satisfy ACT with $68\%$ CL, the number of e-folds increases to $>70$ while the reheating temperature drops to $10^4$ GeV. The preheating stages and the reheating temperature need to be adjusted drastically in favor of the lower temperature. We obtain that the preheating stage of Starobinsky inflation should be mixed between tachyonic and non-tachyonic preheating to favor the analytical estimation, PBH abundance, and the low reheating temperature at once. For that purpose, a varied momentum is necessary to obtain the favored results.

Motivated by recent results from the DESI collaboration, we explore two classes of quintessence models that can give rise to crossing of the dark energy equation of state through the ``phantom divide'' $w=-1$. These are models with Lagrangians that involve higher powers of the kinetic energy $\dot\phi^2$, or where the dark matter (DM) mass is a function of $\phi$. Both have similar features with respect to the reconstructed redshift-dependent $w(z)$: moderate tuning of parameters is required to achieve the desired shape, and it is difficult or impossible for $w(z)$ to continue evolving smoothly as $z$ becomes large. Nevertheless, they give a strong improvement over $\Lambda$CDM in fitting the data. We point out that models of coupled dark matter and dark energy that cross the phantom divide are under pressure from constraints on long-range DM forces. They rule out the simplest renormalizable coupling of scalar DM to quintessence, but leave the fermionic case marginally allowed, while exponentially coupled models are safe from current constraints.

In high-energy and astroparticle physics, event generators play an essential role, even in the simplest data analyses. As analysis techniques become more sophisticated, e.g. based on deep neural networks, their correct description of the observed event characteristics becomes even more important. Physical processes occurring in hadronic collisions are simulated within a Monte Carlo framework. A major challenge is the modeling of hadron dynamics at low momentum transfer, which includes the initial and final phases of every hadronic collision. QCD-inspired phenomenological models used for these phases cannot guarantee completeness or correctness over the full phase space. These models usually include parameters which must be tuned to suitable experimental data. Until now, event generators have been developed and tuned mainly on the basis of data from high-energy physics experiments at accelerators. The wealth of data available from the latest generation of astroparticle experiments has not yet been fully exploited, and in many cases is not satisfactorily described. Both kinds of data sets are complementary as astroparticle experiments provide sensitivity especially to hadrons produced nearly parallel to the collision axis and cover center-of-mass energies up to several hundred TeV, well beyond those reached at colliders so far. In this report, we provide an overview of state-of-the-art event generators and their tuning, including the most relevant inputs from high-energy accelerator and astroparticle experiments. We present a road map that shows, for the first time, how the unified tuning of event generators with accelerator-based and astroparticle data can be performed.
