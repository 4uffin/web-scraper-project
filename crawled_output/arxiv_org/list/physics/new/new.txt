Title:
A Timeless Game: A Game-Theoretic Model of Mass-Geometry Relations
Milad Ghadimi
Subjects:
Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph); History and Philosophy of Physics (physics.hist-ph)
We develop a minimal, timeless game-theoretic representation of the mass-geometry relation. An "Object" (mass) and "Space" (geometry) choose strategies in a static normal-form game; utilities encode stability as mutual consistency rather than dynamical payoffs. In a 2x2 toy model, the equilibria correspond to "light-flat" and "heavy-curved" configurations; a continuous variant clarifies when only trivial interior equilibria appear versus a continuum along a matching ray. Philosophically, the point is representational: a global description may be static while the experience of temporal flow for embedded observers arises from informational asymmetry, coarse-graining, and records. The framework separates time as parameter from relational constraint without committing to specific physical dynamics.

Title:
Classical Mechanics on Finite Spaces
Kaustav Giri, V. V. Sreedhar
Subjects:
Classical Physics (physics.class-ph); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
The connection between topology and quantum mechanics is one of the cornerstones of modern physics. Several examples of current interest like the Aharonov-Bohm effect in quantum mechanics, monopoles and instantons in quantum field theory, the quantum Hall effect in condensed matter physics, anyons in topological quantum computation, and the AdS-CFT correspondence in string theory illustrate this connection.
Since classical mechanics is a limiting case of quantum mechanics, it behooves us to ask how topology impacts classical mechanics. Topological considerations do play an important role in the classical context too, for example in fluid vortices and atmospheric dynamics.
With a desire to understand this connection more deeply, we study classical mechanics on finite spaces. Towards this end, we use the formalism developed by Bering and identify the corrections to the Klein-Gordon equation due to the presence of the boundary. We solve the modified equation in various dimensions under suitable assumptions of symmetry.

Title:
Community-level Contagion among Diverse Financial Assets
An Pham Ngoc Nguyen, Marija Bezbradica, Martin Crane
Subjects:

As global financial markets become increasingly interconnected, financial contagion has developed into a major influencer of asset price dynamics. Motivated by this context, our study explores financial contagion both within and between asset communities. We contribute to the literature by examining the contagion phenomenon at the community level rather than among individual assets. Our experiments rely on high-frequency data comprising cryptocurrencies, stocks and US ETFs over the 4-year period from April 2019 to May 2023. Using the Louvain community detection algorithm, Vector Autoregression contagion detection model and Tracy-Widom random matrix theory for noise removal from financial assets, we present three main findings. Firstly, while the magnitude of contagion remains relatively stable over time, contagion density (the percentage of asset pairs exhibiting contagion within a financial system) increases. This suggests that market uncertainty is better characterized by the transmission of shocks more broadly than by the strength of any single spillover. Secondly, there is no significant difference between intra- and inter-community contagion, indicating that contagion is a system-wide phenomenon rather than being confined to specific asset groups. Lastly, certain communities themselves, especially those dominated by Information Technology assets, consistently appear to act as major contagion transmitters in the financial network over the examined period, spreading shocks with high densities to many other communities. Our findings suggest that traditional risk management strategies such as portfolio diversification through investing in low-correlated assets or different types of investment vehicle might be insufficient due to widespread contagion.

Post crisis Strategies: Antifragility Principles as Catalysts for Urban Evolution Towards Sustainability
Joseph Uguet, Nicola Tollin, Jordi Morató

Urban crises reveal the true essence of cities: their ability to either withstand disorder or collapse under its pressure. This article explores how antifragility principles can transforms urban disruption into levers for reinforcement and innovation. While resilience seeks to restore a lost balance, antifragility goes further: it pushes cities to improve through shocks. Across a critical analysis of post-crisis strategies and the identification of fifteen fundamental theoretical principles, this work proposes a new framework, structuring a proactive and evolutionary approach to urban development. Medellín, Singapore and Fukushima already illustrate this dynamic, showing that adversity can catalyse profound transformations. By integrating institutional flexibility, strategic diversity and self-organization, antifragility poses itself as an alternative to the limits of resilience. Can this model really redefine the way cities adapt to crises? This article paves the way for a decisive reflection to rethink urban planning in an uncertain world.

Title:
A Social Force Model for Companion Groups Considering Relative-Weight Attraction
Lihui Dong, Yingshuang He, Yunfeng Deng, Qiuyu Zheng, Tianming Wang
Subjects:
Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph); Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems (nlin.AO)
This paper introduces an improved social force model for companion group that incorporates relative weight attraction. Based on the traditional social force model, the interaction forces among individuals within leader-follower groups are described by introducing relative weight attraction. Additionally, a velocity synchronization term is integrated into the pedestrians' self-driving force to address the problem of group dispersion commonly found in traditional models. Furthermore, the desired direction of followers within the companion group is refined to adapt to the evacuation movement led by the group leader. These enhancements collectively form a Social Force Model of companion groups considering relative weight attraction. Through comparative analysis of pedestrian evacuation processes in bidirectional channel simulation experiments between the relative weight attraction model and the traditional molecular potential (force) model, this study finds that the relative weight attraction model demonstrates stronger regulation and following capabilities when simulating collisions between companion groups and pedestrians or obstacles, more effectively ensuring group cohesion. Building upon this foundation, this study further investigates the impact of varying companion ratios on evacuation efficiency within the relative-weight attraction model. The results demonstrate that evacuation time steps exhibit a non-monotonic trend (initial increase, followed by a decrease, and a subsequent rise) as the companion ratio escalates. Additionally, across multiple simulation runs, the standard deviation of evacuation time steps expands with increasing companion ratios, indicating heightened fluctuation in individual evacuation timing.

Title:
Oil Peak and the Decline of Net Energy: Policy Implications from an EROI-Entropy Perspective
Shunsuke Nakaya, Jun Matsushima
Subjects:
Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph)
Net energy - the energy obtained from a resource after accounting for the energy expended in its acquisition - fundamentally determines the capacity of societies to sustain and expand. The extended Energy Return on Investment (EROIext) incorporates not only extraction and refining but also transport and end-use infrastructure, yet its long-term dynamics remain poorly understood. Here, we apply a Single-Cycle Lotka-Volterra (SCLV) model to the global petroleum system, calibrated with historical data from 1965-2012. The model projects trajectories of production, capital, and EROIext to 2100, and integrates an entropy-based indicator to evaluate the system's ability to maintain social order. Results show that oil production peaks around 2041, while EROIext declines continuously and falls below unity by 2081. This marks the point at which oil no longer delivers net energy, coinciding with the peak of capital stock, suggesting unsustainable investment in a diminishing resource. The rising entropy ratio signals declining systemic resilience. These findings underscore the importance of evaluating energy systems not only by quantity or cost but also by thermodynamic quality, with direct implications for balancing short-term energy security and long-term sustainability in policy design.

Hybrid Learning and Optimization methods for solving Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem
Monit Sharma, Hoong Chuin Lau

Subjects:
Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is a fundamental NP-hard problem in logistics. Augmented Lagrangian Methods (ALM) for solving CVRP performance depends heavily on well-tuned penalty parameters. In this paper, we propose a hybrid optimization approach that integrates deep reinforcement learning (RL) to automate the selection of penalty parameter values within both classical (RL-C-ALM) and quantum-enhanced (RL-Q-ALM) ALM solvers. Using Soft Actor-Critic, our approach learns penalty values from CVRP instance features and constraint violations. In RL-Q-ALM, subproblems are encoded as QUBOs and solved using Variational Quantum Eigensolvers (VQE). The agent learns across episodes by maximizing solution feasibility and minimizing cost. Experiments show that RL-C-ALM outperforms manually tuned ALM on synthetic and benchmark CVRP instances, achieving better solutions with fewer iterations. Also, RL-Q-ALM matches classical solution quality on small instances but incurs higher runtimes due to quantum overhead. Our results highlight the potential of combining RL with classical and quantum solvers for scalable, adaptive combinatorial optimization.

Title:
A new family of seniority-restricted coupled cluster methods

Subjects:
Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph)
We introduce a novel class of coupled cluster (CC) methods that leverage the seniority concept to enhance efficiency and accuracy in electronic structure calculations. While existing approaches, such as the pair coupled cluster doubles (pCCD) method, are limited to seniority-zero ({\Omega} = 0) wavefunctions,1 we propose a more flexible framework: seniority-restricted coupled cluster (sr-CC). This new methodology selectively constrains the seniority sectors accessible through excitation operators in the cluster expansion, enabling a more systematic exploration of electron correlation effects. By balancing computational cost and accuracy, sr-CC provides a promising pathway for advancing electronic structure theory, particularly in strongly correlated systems.

We derive the hot-electron limit (HEL) closure of the moment hierarchy used to solve the gyrokinetic equations, denoted as gyromoment (GM). By expanding gyroaveraging kernels in the small temperature ratio Ti/Te limit and retaining only essential O(Ti/Te) terms, we obtain a closed system for density, parallel velocity, and parallel and perpendicular temperatures. In the Z-pinch geometry, the GM system with HEL closure is analytically equivalent to the one developed by Ivanov et al. (2022). Numerical benchmarks confirm the closure's accuracy in Z-pinch geometry, reproducing established linear growth rates, nonlinear heat transport, and low-collisionality dynamics. Extension to tokamak-relevant s-alpha geometry, and comparison with gyrokinetic simulations, reveals the HEL closed GM model capabilities and limitations: while transport levels and temporal dynamics are qualitatively preserved even at Ti/Te=1, the absence of higher-order kinetic moments prevents accurate Dimits shift prediction and transport suppression.

Subjects:
Accelerator Physics (physics.acc-ph)
The Cryogenic Division at Fermilab develops large-scale cryogenic systems for particle accelerators and superconducting magnet test facilities. To support design and diagnostics, a Python-based code was created to calculate pressure drops in components such as valves and pipes. This paper presents recent enhancements to the code, including new heat transfer functions that improve the accuracy of thermal and hydraulic predictions. The first application models pressure and temperature changes in Proton Improvement Plant PIP-II relief pipes, aiding pipe sizing and protecting relief valves. The second example analyses heat load evolution in a pipe carrying sub-atmospheric helium, helping interpret temperature sensor data and understand gas return behavior to cold compressors. These improvements significantly expand the tool's capabilities, offering a practical resource for designing and troubleshooting cryogenic systems under dynamic thermal and flow conditions.

The High Field Vertical Magnet Test Facility (HFVMTF) at Fermilab is designed to test superconducting magnets up to 20 tons and 1.3 meters in diameter. Central to the facility is a double-bath superfluid helium cryostat reaching 1.8 K at 1.2 bar. Integrated with a 15 T superconducting dipole from LBNL, HFVMTF supports HTS cable testing for fusion applications. This paper presents the design and fabrication of the cryostat, with a focus on two complex components: the 2 K heat exchanger and the lambda plate. The heat exchanger thermally links sub-atmospheric and pressurized helium baths. The 1.4-meter lambda plate provides thermal isolation and structural support for over 20 tons under 1.3 bar pressure differential. Finite Element Analysis validated the vessel's integrity under maximum load conditions.

Subjects:
Instrumentation and Detectors (physics.ins-det)
Garfield++ is extensively used within the gaseous detector community for comprehensive detector simulations, supporting the full experimental life cycle from design to operation and calibration. The emergence of micro-pattern gaseous detectors has necessitated computationally intensive microscopic avalanche simulations. The acceleration of one of Garfield++'s most demanding algorithms, AvalancheMicroscopic, by porting it to graphics processing units using NVIDIA's CUDA framework is described. The modifications are integrated into the Garfield++ codebase and are accessible to end users with only minor adjustments to their existing code. Benchmark results demonstrate substantial speed-up, especially for high-gain avalanches involving thousands of electrons, thereby enabling more efficient and detailed detector simulations.

OSI-flex: Optimization-Based Shearing Interferometry for Joint Phase and Shear Estimation Using a Flexible Open-Source Framework

Optics (physics.optics); Image and Video Processing (eess.IV)
Shearing interferometry is a common-path quantitative phase imaging technique in which an object beam interferes with a laterally shifted replica of itself, providing high temporal stability, reduced sensitivity to environmental noise, compact design, and compatibility with partially coherent illumination that suppresses coherence-related artifacts. Its principal limitation, however, is that it yields only sheared phase-difference measurements rather than the absolute phase, thereby requiring additional reconstruction step. In this work, we introduce OSI-flex, a flexible, open-source computational framework for quantitative phase reconstruction from sheared phase-difference measurements. The method leverages modern machine learning tools, namely automatic differentiation and the advanced ADAM (Adaptive Moment Estimation) optimizer. The method simultaneously estimates the phase and shear values, enabling it to adapt to experimental conditions where the shear cannot be precisely determined. Because defining shear value is inherently difficult in most systems, yet crucial for effective phase reconstruction, this joint optimization leads to robust and reliable phase retrieval. OSI-flex is highly versatile, supporting arbitrary numbers, magnitudes, and orientations of shear vectors. While optimal reconstruction is achieved with two orthogonal shears, the inclusion of regularization - specifically total variation minimization and sign constraint - enables OSI-flex to remain effective with nonorthogonal or even single-shear measurements. Moreover, OSI-flex accommodates a wide range of shear magnitudes, from subpixel (differential configuration) to several dozen pixels (semi-total shear configuration). Validation with simulations and experimental data confirms quantitative accuracy on calibrated phase objects and demonstrates robustness with 3D-printed cell phantom and follicular thyroid cells.

The Full Flow Purifier for Fermilab's Muon Campus uses a charcoal bed surrounded by a liquid nitrogen jacket to purify up to 240 g/s of helium gas. Fabrication by Ability Engineering Technology Inc. has been completed and the purifier delivered to Fermilab. It is the largest purifier to be used at Fermilab based on both capacity and size. A previous paper discussed the design of purifier for various operational conditions and horizontal shipping. The purifier is designed to withstand 5g force in vertical and 2g force in lateral and longitudinal directions. Transportation experience from vendor to Fermilab and within site is discussed. Integration of the purifier involved design and fabrication of a liquid nitrogen transfer line, regeneration system, and helium piping to connect it to Muon Campus cryogenic system. It also involved establishing electrical, instrumentation and controls connections to the system. Integration of the purifier is discussed in detail. The purifier is to be commissioned using up to 4 MYCOM helium compressors to supply helium and liquid nitrogen supplied by a 60,000-liter tank. Actual effectiveness of the 3-stream heat exchanger is to be estimated based on measured temperatures and flow rate. Impurity levels will be monitored at inlet and outlet of the purifier. Theoretical adsorption capacity of the purifier is calculated based on the measured temperatures and flowrates and is compared to actual adsorption capacity over time.

Many have have taken in hand to write a treatise on the Star of Bethlehem, particularly on Kepler's explanation as a stellar birth, triggered by Mars joining a great conjunction (a meeting of Jupiter and Saturn), as he observed it in October 1604. It is the aim of my short treatise to introduce, at a hopefully well digestible level, into underlying antiquity's concepts of physics, astrology, and astronomy around the time of Christ's birth and to demonstrate their essential developments up to the early modern period. In the latter, Kepler played a significant role. His contributions enabled him to calculate back to the year 7 BC with astonishing precision, locating a triple great conjunction in Pisces, which was then complemented by Mars. This is confirmed by both Babylonian tradition and modern astronomy. The following background provided may be specifically helpful for a more theologically oriented audience, also because the controversy surrounding "geocentric" and "heliocentric" world systems (Copernicus) is touched upon. And, because the overall context raises questions for theology, with which the epilogue concludes.

Structure-preserving long-time simulations of turbulence in magnetized ideal fluids
Klas Modin, Michael Roop
Comments:
19 pages, 14 figures
Subjects:
Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph)
We address three two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics models: reduced magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD), Hazeltine's model, and the Charney-Hasegawa-Mima (CHM) equation. These models are derived to capture the basic features of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence and plasma behaviour. They all possess non-canonical Hamiltonian formulations in terms of Lie-Poisson brackets, which imply an infinite number of conservation laws along with symplecticity of the phase flow. This geometric structure in phase space affects the statistical long-time behaviour. Therefore, to capture the qualitative features in long-time numerical simulations, it is critical to use a discretization that preserves the rich phase space geometry. Here, we use the matrix hydrodynamics approach to achieve structure-preserving discretizations for each model. We furthermore carry out long-time simulations with randomized initial data and a comparison between the models. The study shows consistent behaviour for the magnetic potential: both RMHD and Hazeltine's model produce magnetic dipoles (in CHM, the magnetic potential is prescribed). These results suggest an inverse cascade of magnetic energy and of the mean-square magnetic potential, which is empirically verified via spectral scaling diagrams. On the other hand, the vorticity field dynamics differs between the models: RMHD forms sharp vortex filaments with rapidly growing vorticity values, whereas Hazeltine's model and CHM show only small variation in the vorticity values. Related to this observation, both Hazeltine's model and CHM give spectral scaling diagrams indicating an inverse cascade of kinetic energy not present in RMHD.

Thin-film boundary-layer diffusion of non-equilibrium flow to kinetically limited reactive surfaces via Damköhler thermochemistry tables
Jeffrey D. Engerer, Lincoln N. Collins
Subjects:
Applied Physics (physics.app-ph)
Traditional ablation thermochemistry tables for atmospheric entry are derived from boundary-layer element diffusion assuming homogeneous and heterogeneous thermochemical equilibrium at the vehicle surface. Prior techniques for finite-rate surface reactions predominantly embed specific heterogeneous reaction models within the homogeneous equilibrium solution procedures and tables. This paper disseminates a boundary-layer integral solution for wall-gas free oxygen coupled to finite-rate surface kinetics. Solutions are pre-tabulated along normalized kinetics variables without direct integration into an equilibrium thermochemistry solver. This technique allows greater flexibility in presumed kinetics rates and wall-gas conditions in simple air-carbon systems, but the extensibility to state-of-the-art simulations and complex materials remains uncertain. A derivation and preliminary results are presented to the encourage further development.

The Laser Interferometer Lunar Antenna (LILA), a concept for measuring sub-Hz gravitational waves on the Moon, would use laser strainmeters to obtain extremely sensitive strain measurements from 1 mHz to 1 Hz. With proposed strain sensitivities, LILA would also be able to measure the normal modes of the Moon from 1-10 mHz at high signal-to-noise ratio. Such measurements would enable significant advances in our understanding of both the spherically symmetric and even 3D deep internal structure of the Moon. Strainmeter measurements may even be able to detect the translational mode of the solid inner core of the Moon at frequencies below 0.1 mHz. Inertial seismometers, on the other hand, are unlikely to reach the performance of $\sim10^{-16}$ m/s$^2$/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ required to reliably detect normal modes below 5-10 mHz, even with optimistic assumptions on future projected performance.

We investigate a technique for detecting radio-frequency (RF) electric fields in a Cesium (Cs) vapor cell at room temperature by collecting charge from ionized Rydberg atoms and compare its performance with the established method of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). By applying a known RF field, we measure the response from both the electrical (ionization current-based) and optical (EIT-based) readouts. The ionization current-based method yields a sensitivity of 22~$\mu$Vm$^{-1}$Hz$^{-1/2}$, while the EIT-based method achieves 3.7~$\mu$Vm$^{-1}$Hz$^{-1/2}$. The sensitivity of the ionization current-based method is limited by thermal noise arising from a 2.2~k$\Omega$ resistance between the collection electrodes, attributed to a thin Cs film on the inner surfaces of the vapor cell. Controlling or eliminating the Cs layer can significantly improve the sensitivity of this ionization approach.

Conformational Dynamics of 8-Oxoguanine Mispairing Reveal a Mechanism of Polymerase λ Misincorporation

Experimental evidence has shown the stability of oxygen-stress-damaged guanine, known as 8-oxoguanine. This common oxygen-damaged nucleobase is often found in the presence of reactive oxygen species and can result in the mispairing between adenine and 8-oxoguanine in a Hoogsteen pair. We have computationally investigated the role of 8-oxoguanine to support experimental results and focus the investigation towards the polymerase structure, identifying how 8-oxoguanine interacts in the polymerase environment. Quantum mechanical investigations show the Hoogsteen pairing of adenine and 8-oxoguanine is the most energetically favourable state compared to a Watson-Crick state, supporting experimental evidence. Molecular Dynamical calculation of 8-oxoguanine located in B-DNA provide an average C1' backbone spacing of 1.1 nm compared to adenine-thymine spacing of 1.05 nm but remains within the error margin, however when in the polymerase environment, 8-oxoguanine and the canonical adenine - thymine spacing match at 1.11-1.12nm spacing while 8-oxoguanine is located on the template strand, but is disrupted by tyrosine 251 while situated on the triphosphate strand. We observe that 8-oxoguanine, when paired with adenine in polymerase {\lambda}, can mimic the adenine-thymine structure, as predicted in experimental results, and thus would be misincorporated, but is strongly dependent on its conformation.

Uncovering multi-technology convergence patterns with hypergraphs: Evolution and prediction using patent data

Comments:
20 pages, 8 figures, and 7 tables
Subjects:
Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph)
Technology convergence integrates distinct domains to create novel combinations, driving radical innovation that reshapes markets and industries. However, most approaches rely on pairwise networks that cannot capture multi-technology interactions and suffer scale biases from heterogeneous patenting activity. To overcome these gaps, we propose a hypergraph-based framework that directly models multi-technology convergence and identifies statistically significant convergence via a probabilistic null model. Using four decades of USPTO patent data (1984-2023), we construct two hypergraphs: a co-classification-based hypergraph representing explicit inventive convergence and a co-citation-based hypergraph capturing implicit knowledge-flow convergence. Evolution analysis on both hypergraph types reveals a sustained growth in multi-technology and cross-domain convergence, with a marked shift from chemistry-led to computing-led convergence patterns. Building on these insights, we formulate the forecasting of technology convergence as a hyperedge prediction task. We implement random forest classifiers trained on two complementary feature sets derived from both hypergraphs: similarity features capturing structural and semantic similarities among technologies, and intrinsic features representing inherent attributes of technologies. Predictive results demonstrate that co-citation-based features exhibit stronger predictive power than co-classification-based ones, with their combination achieving optimal performance. Explainable AI analyses identify global knowledge-flow reachability and semantic similarity as dominant drivers of convergence, while intrinsic citation and economic values exhibit contrasting associations with convergence probability. This framework bridges evolution analysis and predictive modeling of multi-technology convergence, offering actionable insights for innovation strategy.

Fluid flow and spatiotemporal chaos in chemically active emulsions

Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn); Biological Physics (physics.bio-ph)
We study phase-separating fluid mixtures as they demix in the presence of chemical reactions that maintain them away from thermodynamic equilibrium. We show that in such chemically active emulsions the interplay of chemical reactions, phase separation, and hydrodynamics effects complex self-organisation and pattern formation that can give rise to spatiotemporal chaos. This chaotic dynamics, unlike in classical turbulence, is not due to fluid inertia $-$ we analyse the system in the Stokes flow regime $-$ and it is different from the $\textit{turbulence}$ of active nematics at low Reynolds number, for our fluid mixtures lack any orientational order. To explore the generic features of nonlinear dynamics in our system, we derive amplitude equations which we find to be identical to those obtained for Rayleigh-Benard convection with mean flow and stress-free conditions at the top and bottom plates. Chemically active emulsions possessing no internal order, we thus establish, can exhibit chaoticity that is driven by interfacial stresses in the fluid mixture.

The method of images to solve certain electrostatic boundary-value problems is taught worldwide in undergraduate-level physics courses. Though it is also possible to employ this technique for solving magnetostatic boundary value problems, examples of this usage are rarely found in textbooks or physics pedagogy literature. In particular, the problem of finding the field due to a magnetic dipole kept in front of a superconducting sphere is an interesting one, because (i) it helps the students to compare with the grounded conducting sphere image problem in electrostatics, and (ii) offers a greater degree of difficulty since the source is a dipole (vector), rather than an electric charge (scalar). The present work demonstrates an intuitive way of solving the problem. The case in which the source dipole is oriented radially with respect to the sphere is solved with a single dipole image. In the case of the transverse orientation of the source dipole, we model the dipole as a current loop. Then, we find the image of the radial and transverse current elements that satisfy the boundary conditions. Then, we show that this method can be used to deduce the form of the image dipoles when the dipole is oriented in the transverse direction. This method is very much intuitive and accessible for undergraduate-level students.

Particle in cell simulation on mode conversion of Saturn's 20 kHz narrowband radio emission

Space Physics (physics.space-ph)
The Z-to-O mode conversion at the density gradient is the prevailing mechanism of narrowband (NB) radio emission in planetary magnetosphere. Most previous numerical models were for NB emission observed in the Earth magnetosphere, using the cold plasma fluid approximation that excluded any kinetic effect. Here we investigate the Z-to-O conversion process underlying the Saturn's 20 kHz NB emission, using the fully-kinetic and electromagnetic particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation. We simulate the whole process starting from the pumping of the Z mode, to its propagation and reflection, and further conversion into the O mode radiation. The energy conversion rate of the Z-to-O process is estimated to be 10-20%. This provides the first quantitative estimate of such rate with PIC simulations.

Numerical Study on Jet-Like Outwash Induced by Multi-Rotor eVTOLs and Engineering Approaches for Outwash Mitigation

Subjects:

This study presents a comprehensive computational analysis of eVTOL outwash phenomena, emphasizing the impact of rotor geometric configuration and alignment on hazardous airflow patterns at vertiports. Utilizing nondimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations and the k-omega SST turbulence model in OpenFOAM, the research characterizes jet-like outwash behaviors across multi-rotor eVTOL architectures. Based on this computational framework, the results highlight how propeller count and inter-propeller distance govern outwash intensity, orientation, propagation, and boundary layer structure. For power lift eVTOL, low propeller count with narrow inter-propeller distance generates highly directional and intensified jet-like outwash with the propagation range exceeds the current regulatory safety areas according to FAA EB105a. In contrast, higher propeller counts and wider inter-propeller distance mitigate the maximum velocity and the propagation range of the jet-like outwash, supporting safer vertiport layouts. Additionally, high-propeller-count configurations form vertically stratified and thickened outwash velocity boundary layers. Targeted engineering solutions, such as modular blast deflectors oriented to predicted outwash patterns, demonstrate the potential to reduce vertiport spatial requirements by up to 82% while preserving operational safety. These findings support integration of aircraft and infrastructure design, regulatory compliance, and cost-effective vertiport safety area management for urban air mobility. The work advances engineering responses for pivotal aerodynamic challenges and lays a foundation for future studies on optimal outwash mitigation device geometry and configuration for vertiports.

Electrically controlled topological interface modes in graphene-based photonic superlattices

Subjects:
Optics (physics.optics)
We demonstrate the electrical control of topological interface modes at the interface between a graphene-based photonic superlattice and a uniform dielectric medium. Specifically, by integrating graphene sheets into the unit cell of metallodielectric superlattices, the presence or absence of topological interface modes can be dynamically controlled by tuning the permittivity of graphene via electrical gating. These topological modes emerge when the spatial average of the permittivity of the superlattices is negative and vanish as the chemical potential of graphene is adjusted to render the averaged permittivity positive. The dependence of the existence of topological interface modes on the sign of the spatial average of the permittivity is fundamentally related to the emergence of a Dirac point, which arises when the averaged permittivity of the superlattices reaches zero and is accompanied by the Zak phase transition, thus resulting in the appearance and disappearance of topological interface modes. Furthermore, we find that the propagation constant of topological interface modes decreases when increasing the chemical potential of graphene. The robustness of such topological interface modes is also demonstrated. Our work provides clear physical insights and offers a promising approach to the dynamic control of topological interface modes.

The lifetime of the isomeric state in fully stripped 94Ru44+ ions has been measured using isochronous mass spectrometry (IMS) at the experimental Cooler Storage Ring (CSRe) of the Heavy Ion Research Facility in Lanzhou (HIRFL). Previously, the isomeric lifetime was determined by analyzing the decay time points of individual decay events. In this paper, we present a novel approach to determine the isomeric lifetime based on the survival time of ions obtained from IMS. The survival lifetimes of the ground and isomeric states of 94Ru44+ were measured to be s and s in the laboratory, respectively. Given that the ground state of 94Ru44+ has a natural lifetime of approximately 75 min, its survival lifetime in the experimental setup was predominantly determined by the beam-loss lifetime, including interactions with residual gas in the storage ring and carbon foil of the detector. In contrast, the survival lifetime of 94mRu44+ was governed by its intrinsic nuclear lifetime and additional beam-loss effects. The nuclear decay lifetime of 94mRu44+ was extracted through differential survival lifetime analysis between ground and isomeric states, under the assumption that the beam-loss lifetimes for both quantum systems are identical. Using this novel methodology, the lifetime measured in the laboratory frame was s. After relativistic time-dilation corrections, the corresponding rest-frame half-life was calculated to be s. This result demonstrates excellent consistency with previous experimental results, validating the reliability of the new method. This method is suitable for determining half-lives of highly charged ions in the range of several tens of microseconds to milliseconds using IMS.

Many-body correlation plays a crucial role in the low-energy positron-molecule scattering dynamics. In the present work, we have integrated a recent model correlation potential, developed by Swann and Gribakin, with the single-center expansion method and verified its efficacy in reproducing the best of ab initio and experimental results, for both non-polar and polar molecules. Starting with the already tested molecules-hydrogen, ethylene, and acetylene with the model correlation, we extended our calculations to oxygen-containing molecules: oxygen, water, and formic acid. In order to provide a comparative study, we have also performed calculations employing the model correlation of Perdew and Zunger. Integral, differential, and momentum transfer cross sections are reported for the target molecules. Positron virtual/bound state formation is also predicted using both of the model correlations. Overall, an improved agreement of our results with the literature for the recent model suggests the approach can be employed for larger systems, where the ab initio techniques are difficult to implement.

Upstream motion of oil droplets in co-axial Ouzo flow due to Marangoni forces

Subjects:
Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)
To explore the physicochemical hydrodynamics of phase-separating ternary liquids (Ouzo-type), a binary oil-ethanol mixture is introduced into a co-flowing stream of water. Oil droplets nucleate at the interface between the two liquids, leading to a larger oil droplet interacting with the ethanol-rich jet. Although buoyancy forces and hydrodynamic drag forces push the droplet in downstream direction, we observe an upstream motion. Using computational fluid dynamics simulations of a simplified model system, we identify the nucleation zone for oil droplets and uncover Marangoni forces to be responsible for the upstream motion of the droplet. A semi-analytical model allows us to identify the key parameters governing this effect. A general conclusion is that Marangoni stresses can reverse the motion of droplets through channels, where the surrounding liquid is a multi-component mixture. The insights from this work are not only relevant for channel flow, but more generally, for the physicochemical hydrodynamics of multiphase, multi-component systems.

Runaway electrons during a coil quench in stellarators

Subjects:
Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph)
It is shown that avalanches of runaway electrons can arise in stellarators, even if there is no net toroidal current in the plasma or the magnetic-field coils, if the current in the latter varies rapidly enough, e.g. due to a superconductor quench. In present-day devices such as W7-X, significant runaway generation is theoretically possible only at very low gas or plasma density in the vacuum vessel, e.g. between discharges, if a seed population of free electrons is present. In reactor-scale stellarators, more dangerous runaway generation may occur both between discharges and during low-density plasma operation. Since a radiation-induced seed population is necessarily present in an activated device, an accidental coil ramp-down could convert substantial magnetic energy into wall-damaging runaway currents. There is however much more time to mitigate such events than in tokamaks disruptions.

We derive a two-dimensional symplectic map for particle motion at the plasma edge by modeling the electrostatic potential as a superposition of integer spatial harmonics with relative phase shift, then reduce it to a two-wave model to study the transport dependence on the perturbation amplitudes, relative phase, and spatial-mode choice. Using particle transmissivity as a confinement criterion, identical-mode pairs exhibit phase-controlled behavior: anti-phase waves produce destructive interference and strong confinement while in-phase waves add constructively and drive chaotic transport. Mode-mismatched pairs produce richer phase-space structure with higher-order resonances and sticky regions; the transmissivity boundaries become geometrically complex. Box-counting dimensions quantify this: integer dimension smooth boundaries for identical modes versus non-integer fractal-like dimension for distinct modes, demonstrating that phase and spectral content of waves jointly determine whether interference suppresses or promotes transport.

However, undergraduate research at Community Colleges is relatively rare, due in part to their focus on teaching excellence. Research partnerships with four year colleges about exciting and accessible science topics, facilitated by researchers such as postdoctoral fellows, can be a powerful path forward.

Partially Molten Plumes and Melt-Fingers: Two Modes of Magma-Transport through the Mantle in Terrestrial Bodies

To understand the dynamics of partially molten mantle in terrestrial bodies, we carried out a linear perturbation analysis and 2-D numerical simulations of magma-matrix flow in a horizontal layer, where decompression melting generates magma that percolates through the convecting matrix. Our study shows that there are two regimes for the upward migration of magma, depending on the melt-buoyancy parameter B_m, which is the ratio of the Stokes velocity of matrix to the percolation velocity of melt, both driven by the melt-buoyancy. At large B_m, the magmatism-mantle upwelling (MMUb) feedback dominates the convective flow in the layer: decompression melting during upwelling enhances magma buoyancy, which further strengthens the upwelling. When a solid layer is overlaid on the partially molten layer, the MMUb feedback induces partially molten plumes that ascend through the solid layer by their melt-buoyancy. At lower B_m, in contrast, a perturbation in the melt-content in the partially molten layer propagates upward as a porosity wave: the perturbation induces a spatial variation in the rate of expansion or contraction of matrix caused by magma migration, leading to an upward shift of the perturbation. When a solid layer is overlaid, the porosity wave develops also along the layer boundary to induce a finger-like magma structure, or melt-finger, that extends upward into the solid layer. The threshold value of B_m for MMUb feedback suggests that it can explain volcanism forming Large Igneous Provinces, but not hotspot volcanism on Earth. Since B_m increases with decreasing matrix viscosity, volcanism caused by the MMUb feedback is likely to have been more important in earlier terrestrial planets where the mantle was hotter and softer. Melt-fingers are, in contrast, expected to have developed in the lunar mantle if a partially molten layer has developed at its base in the history of the Moon.

Single-photon-level imaging at 1550 nm is a key driver for significant advancements in the next-generation laser detection technology. This cutting-edge approach plays a vital role in space ranging, target recognition, and three-dimensional remote sensing. However, it has faced severe challenges such as insufficient noise-tolerant performance. Here, we introduced noise-tolerant correlated coincidence imaging (CCI) based on super-correlated light. The light source, generated through nonlinear interaction between a pulsed laser and a photonic crystal fiber, exhibits a broader power-law photon number probability distribution and extremely strong photon correlation (with second-order correlation function $g^{(2)}(0)$ up to 18,166). Our noise-tolerant CCI can resist random environmental noise up to 100,000 times stronger than the echo signal photons. Super-correlated light offers an exceptionally strong noise tolerance for single-photon-level imaging in extreme environments with intense noise, paving the way for the future development of extremely sensitive light detection.

The rapid and global spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), underscored the urgent need for fast, reliable, and adaptable diagnostic tools capable of responding to current and future viral threats. Early diagnosis is key to limiting transmission, and biosensors based on nanomaterials offer promising solutions for accurate and rapid bioanalyte detection. In this work, we present a scalable matrix of graphene-based field-effect transistors (GFETs) for the direct and rapid detection of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. High-quality graphene is functionalized in a single step with ACE2-His, enabling detection of the spike protein with a limit of detection as low as 1 fg/mL in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). A robust statistical analysis, based on measurements from approximately 70 devices per analyte concentration, demonstrates the reproducibility and reliability of the platform. This label-free, scalable, and reproducible COVID-19 antigen sensor can be readily adapted to detect emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants or other viral pathogens, offering a flexible approach for future diagnostic applications.

The runaway electron (RE) - induced damage on boron nitride (BN) tiles mounted on the inner bumpers of the WEST tokamak is modeled employing available empirical input and experimental constraints, concerning the post-mortem documentation of the damaged material topology and infra-red camera observations of the long-time decay of the surface temperature. A newly developed work-flow for the modeling of brittle failure due to RE impacts, recently validated against a controlled DIII-D experiment, is employed. Monte Carlo simulations of RE transport into BN provide volumetric heat source maps for finite-element simulations of the linear thermoelastic material response, while the brittle failure onset is predicted on the basis of the Rankine criterion. The physics of thermal stress driven failure and explosion are well captured by this model, which exhibits high sensitivity to RE impact parameters. Despite the accidental nature of the damage events, the workflow predicts failure in accordance with observations for realistic loading specifications expected in WEST disruptions.

We investigate the process of creating electron-positron pairs from laser-matter interaction in pre-ionised foam targets using particle-in-cell simulations. A high-intensity laser pulse drives electrons via direct laser acceleration up to a cone-shaped reflector. The high-energy electrons interact with the reflected laser pulse, generating abundant pairs. The effects of the plasma-channel shape on the propagation of the laser pulse and subsequent pair production is studied. The results show that the number of Compton emission and Breit-Wheeler pair creation events is highly sensitive to the diffraction of the laser due to its interaction with the foam.

What does it mean for a system to compute?

Subjects:
Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph)
Many real-world dynamic systems, both natural and artificial, are understood to be performing computations. For artificial dynamic systems, explicitly designed to perform computation - such as digital computers - by construction, we can identify which aspects of the dynamic system match the input and output of the computation that it performs, as well as the aspects of the dynamic system that match the intermediate logical variables of that computation. In contrast, in many naturally occurring dynamical systems that we understand to be computers, even though we neither designed nor constructed them - such as the human brain - it is not a priori clear how to identify the computation we presume to be encoded in the dynamic system. Regardless of their origin, dynamical systems capable of computation can, in principle, be mapped onto corresponding abstract computational machines that perform the same operations. In this paper, we begin by surveying a wide range of dynamic systems whose computational properties have been studied. We then introduce a very broadly applicable framework for identifying what computations(s) are emulated by a given dynamic system. After an introduction, we summarize key examples of dynamical systems whose computational properties have been studied. We then introduce a very broadly applicable framework that defines the computation performed by a given dynamical system in terms of maps between that system's evolution and the evolution of an abstract computational machine. We illustrate this framework with several examples from the literature, in particular discussing why some of those examples do not fully fall within the remit of our framework. We also briefly discuss several related issues, such as uncomputability in dynamical systems, and how to quantify the value of computation in naturally occurring computers.

For more than half a century, dualities have been at the heart of modern physics. From quantum mechanics to statistical mechanics, condensed matter physics, quantum field theory and quantum gravity, dualities have proven useful in solving problems that are otherwise quite intractable. Being surprising and unexpected, dualities have been taken to raise philosophical questions about the nature and formulation of scientific theories, scientific realism, emergence, symmetries, explanation, understanding, and theory construction. This book discusses what dualities are, gives a selection of examples, explores the themes and roles that make dualities interesting, and highlights their most salient types. It aims to be an entry point into discussions of dualities in both physics and philosophy. The philosophical discussion emphasises three main topics: whether duals are theoretically equivalent, the view of scientific theories that is suggested by dualities (namely, a geometric view of theories), and the compatibility between duality and emergence.

Prediction of complete step-by-step chemical reaction mechanisms (CRMs) remains a major challenge. Whereas the traditional approaches in CRM tasks rely on expert-driven experiments or costly quantum chemical computations, contemporary deep learning (DL) alternatives ignore key intermediates and mechanistic steps and often suffer from hallucinations. We present DeepMech, an interpretable graph-based DL framework employing atom- and bond-level attention, guided by generalized templates of mechanistic operations (TMOps), to generate CRMs. Trained on our curated ReactMech dataset (~30K CRMs with 100K atom-mapped and mass-balanced elementary steps), DeepMech achieves 98.98+/-0.12% accuracy in predicting elementary steps and 95.94+/-0.21% in complete CRM tasks, besides maintaining high fidelity even in out-of-distribution scenarios as well as in predicting side and/or byproducts. Extension to multistep CRMs relevant to prebiotic chemistry, demonstrates the ability of DeepMech in effectively reconstructing pathways from simple primordial substrates to complex biomolecules such as serine and aldopentose. Attention analysis identifies reactive atoms/bonds in line with chemical intuition, rendering our model interpretable and suitable for reaction design.

We demonstrate that in the off-diagonal trimer lattices Zak phase carries quantized screw-type dislocations winding around degeneracies in parameter space. If the lattice evolves in time periodically, as in adiabatic Thouless pump, corresponding closed trajectory in parameter space is characterized by a Chern number equal the negative total winding number of Zak phase dislocations enclosed by the trajectory. We discuss correspondence between bulk Chern numbers and the edge-states in a finite system evolving along various pumping cycles.

Coherent light sources in deep ultra-violet (DUV) is essential for various applications such as biomedical imaging and biosensing. Nonlinear crystals (NLCs) generate DUV light, but limited by its bulky thickness, low transparency, and strict narrowband phase-matching conditions. Demonstrating compact, broadband, chiral, and focused DUV light integrated device is elusive. In this work, we present the first demonstration of chiral DUV third harmonic generation (THG) in a dielectric metasurface made from crystalline silicon (c-Si) of compact thickness 400 nm. Metasurface supports chiral bound states in the continuum resonance at fundamental wavelength 800 nm with experimental high Q-factor of 130 and modal phase-matched plasmonic resonance at the third harmonic wavelength for efficient THG. Generating DUV-THG power is up to 12 nW using peak power of 15 GW/cm2. Furthermore, we developed a nonlocal metalens operating in DUV for focusing the chiral DUV-THG using the same chiral BIC cavity and phase-gradient approach. Our platform creates efficient, ultracompact, and multifunctional integrated devices for future integrated DUV nanophotonics devices in MedTech, imaging, and advanced manufacturing.

In this work, we incorporate long-range electrostatic interactions in the form of the Coulomb model with fixed charges into the functional form of short-range machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs), particularly in the Moment Tensor Potential and Equivariant Tensor Network potential. We show that explicit incorporation of the Coulomb interactions with fixed charges leads to a significant reduction of energy fitting errors, namely, more than four times, of short-range MLIPs trained on organic dimers of charged molecules. Furthermore, with our long-range models we demonstrate a significant improvement in the prediction of the binding curves of the organic dimers of charged molecules. Finally, we show that the results calculated with MLIPs are in good correspondence with those obtained with density functional theory for organic dimers of charged molecules.

The collective migration of epithelial groups of cells plays a central role in processes such as embryo development, wound healing, and cancer invasion. While finite cell clusters are known to collectively migrate in response to external gradients, the competing effect of possible endogenous cues is largely this http URL, we demonstrate that the polarization of peripheral cells that pull the cluster's edge outward is sufficient to induce and sustain the collective migration of confluent clusters. We use a general continuum model to show that the underlying shape-sensing mechanism is purely mechanical, relying on long-range hydrodynamic interactions and cell-cell alignment forces. As a proof-of-concept, we validate our findings with experiments on monolayer clusters from various cell lines, where we control initial shapes and sizes. The mechanism operates independently of external signals and will generally interfere with them. Specifically, we predict and observe experimentally that it can override collective durotaxis, reversing the direction of migration. Together, our results offer a physical framework for understanding how cell interactions govern the interplay between global shape and collective motion and afford engineering principles for optimal control and manipulation of cell cluster shape and motion.

On the Hamiltonian used in Polaritonic Chemistry

Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
Experiments have shown that strong coupling between molecular excitations and a mode of a Fabry--Pérot cavity can significantly alter molecular properties, such as reaction rates and equilibrium constants. However, in spite of the large body of theoretical work, the mechanism behind this change is still not well understood. In order to make progress, we first take a step back and question the appropriateness of the Hamiltonian that most recent studies are based on. In particular, we investigate the dipole self-energy cross terms, which have received attention as they seem to mediate distance-independent interactions between all molecules in the cavity. However, it is often overlooked that these terms are known to cancel exactly with the intermolecular Coulombic interactions -- which on the other hand are usually neglected. In this work, we revisit how this cancellation comes about in free space and in a perfect cavity, and we discuss how the situation changes for a more realistic cavity in the framework of macroscopic QED. Finally, we discuss the implications of this cancellation for the single-mode Hamiltonian.

Bio-inspired whisker sensors are employed in diverse applications such as fluid-flow sensing, texture analysis, and environmental exploration. However, existing designs often face challenges related to durability, fabrication complexity, and response consistency. To address these issues, we propose a modular architecture that decomposes whisker sensors into five functional components: the whisker element (WE), compliant element (CE), sensing element (SE), support structure (SS), and data acquisition module (DAQ). We develop and compare four in-house sensor designs built using this architecture, each differing in material choice, sensing modality, and mechanical structure. To unify heterogeneous sensor outputs, we introduce a calibration strategy that maps raw sensor readings-whether from pressure, magnetic flux, or visual features-into a common representation: the bending moment at the whisker base. This representation supports consistent interpretation and comparison across sensing techniques. We adopt texture roughness analysis as a representative sensing task to evaluate design trade-offs. Each whisker sensor's frequency-domain response is benchmarked against a high-resolution laser sensor using standardized roughness specimens. Empirical results show that rigid whiskers improve accuracy in texture classification, while flexible whiskers provide robustness for exploratory robotics tasks. Among the evaluated designs, the Hall-effect sensor with a rubber CE demonstrates the most favorable balance of durability, reconfigurability, and fabrication simplicity.

Climate projections have uncertainties related to components of the climate system and their interactions. A typical approach to quantifying these uncertainties is to use climate models to create ensembles of repeated simulations under different initial conditions. Due to the complexity of these simulations, generating such ensembles of projections is computationally expensive. In this work, we present ArchesClimate, a deep learning-based climate model emulator that aims to reduce this cost. ArchesClimate is trained on decadal hindcasts of the IPSL-CM6A-LR climate model at a spatial resolution of approximately 2.5x1.25 degrees. We train a flow matching model following ArchesWeatherGen, which we adapt to predict near-term climate. Once trained, the model generates states at a one-month lead time and can be used to auto-regressively emulate climate model simulations of any length. We show that for up to 10 years, these generations are stable and physically consistent. We also show that for several important climate variables, ArchesClimate generates simulations that are interchangeable with the IPSL model. This work suggests that climate model emulators could significantly reduce the cost of climate model simulations.

Reconfigurable beam splitters capable of being arbitrarily programmed for the power splitting ratios are vital for the adaptive optical networks and photonic computing. Conventional mechanisms such as thermo-optic, free-carrier, or mechanical tuning are usually volatile and require continuous power, limiting their suitability for low-frequency and low power-consumption programmable operations. Here, we experimentally demonstrate an electrically reconfigurable beam splitter based on the low-loss phase-change material Sb2Se3, enabling multi-level and arbitrary splitting-ratio (SR) control. By locally triggering phase transitions in the coupling region with integrated micro-electrodes, we exploit the high refractive-index contrast between different phases and negligible absorption in the near-infrared wavelength of Sb2Se3 to precisely tune the coupling strength with non-volatile retention. 8-level of power splitting states is achieved within a compact footprint of ~14.5-{\mu}m in the experiments, with insertion loss is ~1 dB across 1515-1550 nm and near-zero static power. Combining the advantages of compactness, broad bandwidth, low loss, non-volatility, and multi-level control experimentally, this device provides a universal building block for scalable, energy-efficient reconfigurable photonic circuits, with great prospects in optical computing and intelligent communication systems.

Multiple droplets dynamics on cylindrical fiber
J. Van Hulle, N. Vandewalle, Z. Pan
Subjects:
Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)
We investigate the descent of a single droplet on a vertical fiber and its role in generating additional droplets. As the droplet slides, it deposits a non-uniform liquid film whose thickness decreases along the fiber. The thicker portion near the release point undergoes a Rayleigh-Plateau instability, leading to the formation of a new droplet. This newly formed droplet initially accelerates by accumulating fluid from the film ahead, then shifts to a decelerating phase once fluid loss at its rear dominates. Ultimately, it merges with the original droplet. This refeeding allows the droplet to travel further. Successive generations of droplets can similarly arise, governed by the evolving film thickness. We develop theoretical models that capture each phase of motion and discuss the experimental and theoretical aspects of this cascading cycle of droplet generation.

Contact line friction (CLF) of bubbles is ubiquitous, from bubbles on a beer glass to H2 bubbles sliding over electrodes in electrolysis. However, a fundamental understanding of CLF of bubbles is still missing, mainly due to the challenge of precisely controlling bubble sliding. For example, it is not clear how bubbles start sliding and how CLF of bubbles depends on velocity. We therefore developed a bubble friction force instrument to directly measure bubble CLF. This force develops from a static regime, through a transition, to a kinetic regime. This entire process is quantitatively described by a modified Kawasaki-Furmidge equation. Bubble CLF was measured for velocities from 0.2 micron/s to 2 mm/s, revealing a transition from a constant CLF regime below about 60 micron/s to a velocity-dependent CLF regime on surfaces with various wettability. The velocity dependence stems from interfacial adaptation governed by the liquid ionic environment with a relaxation time of around 10 microsecond. Moreover, CLF of bubbles can be measured on hydrophilic surfaces and under a challenging H2 atmosphere, overcoming the limitations of current droplet-based methods. Our results provide a quantitative basis for understanding CLF of bubbles with relevance to many applications, including bubble manipulation and electrochemistry.

Intraoperative optical imaging is essential for surgical precision and patient safety, but current systems present anatomical and fluorescence information separately, causing delays and increasing cognitive load. A unified system for simultaneous visualization is critically needed to enhance guidance and efficiency. To develop and validate a multispectral imaging system that overcomes fragmented intraoperative imaging by simultaneously capturing and integrating white light reflectance and multiple fluorescence signals in real-time, enhancing surgical precision and safety. The system integrates two synchronized color cameras with optimized optical components, including custom filters and a beam splitter, tailored for clinically relevant fluorophores protoporphyrin IX (PpIX), fluorescein sodium, and indocyanine green (ICG). Advanced image processing techniques enhance visualization accuracy. Performance was evaluated using phantoms simulating clinical conditions. The system provided real time, simultaneous visualization of white light and multiple fluorescence signals without mode switching. Fluorescence emissions from PpIX, fluorescein sodium, and ICG were accurately separated using linear unmixing algorithms. Reflectance images showed high color fidelity, with Delta E values indicating imperceptible to barely perceptible differences compared to a conventional camera. Latency was minimal, ensuring immediate visual feedback suitable for intraoperative use. This multispectral imaging system addresses the limitations of fragmented intraoperative imaging by enabling continuous, real time, integrated visualization of anatomical and fluorescence information. It streamlines workflow, reduces cognitive load, and supports more precise interventions. By leveraging components similar to conventional surgical microscopes, it offers a practical, cost effective solution aligned with clinical needs.

This work presents the rovibrational spectra of the two strongest first overtone bands of the asymmetric stretching mode $\nu_3$ ($2\nu_3^{2+}$ and $2\nu_3^{2-}$) of the hydronium ion, H$_3$O$^+$. The measurements were performed in a temperature-variable cryogenic 22 pole ion trap using leak-out spectroscopy (LOS), covering an energy range of $6750-6950$ cm$^{-1}$.
The spectra were fit with a standard oblate symmetric top Hamiltonian and additional off-diagonal matrix elements accounting for $l$-doubling to obtain the spectroscopic constants and the band origins, which were determined to be $6845.610(14)$ cm$^{-1}$ for $2\nu_3^{2+}$ and $6878.393(13)$ cm$^{-1}$ for $2\nu_3^{2-}$.

Assessment of the Gradient Jump Penalisation in Large-Eddy Simulations of Turbulence

Subjects:
Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)
This research investigates the efficacy of the gradient jump penalisation (GJP) in large eddy simulations (LES) when coupled with active subgrid-scale (SGS) models. GJP is a stabilisation method tailored for the continuous Galerkin spectral element method, aiming at mitigating non-physical oscillations induced by discontinuous velocity gradients across element interfaces. We demonstrate that GJP effectively smoothens fields from LES without a salient impact on flow dynamics for the Taylor--Green vortex (TGV) at $Re=1600$, periodic hill flows at bulk Reynolds numbers $Re_b=10595$ and $37000$, as well as turbulent channel flow at $Re_{\tau} \approx 550$. In the TGV case, the application of GJP results in decreased fluctuations at only high wavenumbers compared to simulations without GJP. The periodic hill flow simulations indicate the applicability of GJP in wall-resolved LES (WRLES) involving curved geometries, though it tends to dissipate some of the finer details in the solution. Finally, in the analysis of the canonical turbulent channel flow cases, GJP leads a higher resolved turbulent kinetic energy than simulations without GJP and direct numerical simulations. GJP's mechanism is identified as providing enhanced dissipation at high wavenumbers but accompanied with insufficient dissipation at low wavenumbers, leading to a pronounced spectral cut-off. Non-physical oscillations on element interfaces are reflected as spikes in the power spectral density. By evaluating the sharpness of the strongest spike, GJP is shown to smoothen the spectra, however without completely removing the gradient jumps at low computational resolution.

The critical role of substrates in mitigating the power-efficiency trade-off in near-field thermophotovoltaics

Optics (physics.optics); Applied Physics (physics.app-ph)
Near-field thermophotovoltaic systems can achieve ultra-high power densities, however, this often comes at the cost of reduced efficiency. We show that this power-efficiency trade-off can be mitigated through substrate engineering. We exploit gradient-based optimization and show that thin lossless metallic films with plasma frequencies resonantly matched to the plasmonic emitter can yield high power and spectral efficiency by spectrally enhancing and confining radiative heat transfer to a narrow spectral range just above the photovoltaic bandgap. Compared to noble metals and air-bridged structures, designs deriving from such optimization yield more than an order-of-magnitude increase in radiative power density while maintaining high efficiency. Our results highlight the critical role of the substrate and the potential of substrate optimization for overcoming fundamental limitations of near-field thermophotovoltaic systems.

We present an open-source Python library for simulating two-dimensional incompressible Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities in stratified shear flows. The solver employs a fractional-step projection method with spectral Poisson solution via Fast Sine Transform, achieving second-order spatial accuracy. Implementation leverages NumPy, SciPy, and Numba JIT compilation for efficient computation. Four canonical test cases explore Reynolds numbers 1000--5000 and Richardson numbers 0.1--0.3: classical shear layer, double shear configuration, rotating flow, and forced turbulence. Statistical analysis using Shannon entropy and complexity indices reveals that double shear layers achieve 2.8$\times$ higher mixing rates than forced turbulence despite lower Reynolds numbers. The solver runs efficiently on standard desktop hardware, with 384$\times$192 grid simulations completing in approximately 31 minutes. Results demonstrate that mixing efficiency depends on instability generation pathways rather than intensity measures alone, challenging Richardson number-based parameterizations and suggesting refinements for subgrid-scale representation in climate models.

Despite its pervasive implications, many cities around the world continue to expand in a fragmented and horizontal manner. Here, we analyse the complex dynamics of urban growth across 69 metropolitan areas in Mexico, using census data from 1990 to 2020, and develop a model of urban form change that considers changes in population size, density, and spatial configuration. We employ a radial probability density function and the urban expansion factor to create a framework for comparing urban expansion over time and across different regions. Over the past three decades, Mexico's urban population has nearly doubled; however, populations have shifted outward, resulting in a decline of 2.5 million residents in central areas. Our analysis shows that distances from the city centre have increased by 28% on average, driven by population losses in central zones combined with growth in peripheral regions.

On the enhanced Balmer emission of hydrogen in helium Capacitively Coupled Radio Frequency (CCRF) plasma

Subjects:
Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph)
The present study investigates the observation and enhancement in the intensity of the hydrogen Balmer series emission in a He CCRF plasma using optical emission spectroscopy (OES). In addition to the characteristic line emission of He atoms, the Balmer series of hydrogen and the molecular emission of N2 are also observed in the He discharge. These emissions were primarily attributed to the presence of water vapor in the chamber. In order to confirm the role of He, the study is also performed using air and Ar where no such Balmer series emissions is seen. Experimental evidence suggests that He metastables transfer energy to trace amount of water content present in the vacuum chamber. The results point towards the hypothesis that energy exchange between metastable He and water molecules could be the underlying mechanism. Since the energy of He metastables exceeds the ionization energy of H or H2O molecule, Penning ionization is expected to occur upon their interaction. The H ions formed as a result, consequently recombine with electrons in the plasma, emitting the Balmer series. Furthermore, the emission intensity of the Balmer series of H depends on the electron density of the He plasma. Experiments also show significant deviations in the intensity ratios of the Balmer series from conventional discharges, indicating difference in the underlying population mechanism. A Collisional Radiative (CR) model for measured plasma parameters was used to estimate the metastable population density to understand the mechanism behind the enhancement of the emission intensity. The increase in the metastable densities as well as the radiative recombination cross section appear to be responsible for the observed enhancement. We believe these results will be significant in terms of applications, in addition to providing a fundamental understanding of energy transfer between metastables of He and H2O.

A State-Specific Iterative Decoupling Scheme Based on Perturbation Theory for Low-Energy Electronic States

Subjects:
Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph); Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
In this work, we introduce a selective and scalable extension of the multi-step Rayleigh-Schrodinger and Brillouin-Wigner perturbative scheme (see arXiv:2408.16505), designed to efficiently access the low-energy spectrum of molecular systems. The method proceeds by combining successive effective Hamiltonian diagonalizations inspired by second-order Rayleigh-Schrodinger perturbation theory, with a Brillouin-Wigner correction applied to individually optimized states using an updated partitioning of the Hamiltonian. At each step, a zeroth-order state is identified and progressively decoupled from the remaining higher-lying states, thereby enabling a well-conditioned Brillouin-Wigner expansion for the energy correction. In contrast to previous approaches, the method selectively targets a small number of low-lying states, significantly reducing the numerical overhead while maintaining spectroscopic accuracy. The robustness of the method is demonstrated on the LiH and H4 molecules, where accurate excitation energies are obtained for the lowest singlet states using compact model spaces, confirming its potential for realistic applications.

Optics (physics.optics)
Light matter interactions can be substantially altered in the presence of time varying media. We study the interaction between a harmonic electric dipole and a plasmonic time crystal slab. Temporal modulation of the plasma frequency enables near field gain, allowing the dipole to absorb rather than emit energy, suppressing nonradiative losses. At the parametric resonance condition, the slab radiates strongly to the far field, producing hundred per cent oscillations in the radiated power at distances up to a thousand times the epsilon near zero wavelength. These findings reveal a new mechanism for controlling light matter interaction in time varying plasmonic systems

Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph)
With the recent inception of intense pulsed THz sources via optical rectification using crystalline lithium niobate, non-perturbative measurements of the internal local magnetic field are now possible using Pulsed Polarimetry on any magnetic fusion device. Pulsed Polarimetry resolves the sightline magnetic field and density, analogous to RADAR measurements of the spatial distribution of precipitation. With a suitable sightline, the FRC midplane density and axial field profiles can be determined with the azimuthal current density given by Ampere's law. Pulsed Polarimetry can be enhanced to measure the sightline distributed electron temperature by adding spectroscopy. A THz Pulsed Spectropolarimeter using a heterodyne receiver is appropriate if collective Thomson backscatter is induced. In this case, electronic filtering provides spatial distributions of the ion spectral density function. The sightline bulk ion temperature as well as confined fast ion velocity distributions can be measured which is of particular importance to plasmas that are heated and sustained by NBI. The ability to steer the sightline without loss of alignment distinguishes this diagnostic from crossbeam diagnostics. The term, diagnostic agility denotes a diagnostic's ability to provide both temporal and spatial real-time feedback on demand across the poloidal plane analogous to 2D imaging Doppler RADAR. THz Pulsed Spectropolarimetry is extensively detailed along with simulated measurements on an FRC equilibrium. Comparisons are made with long pulse CTS crossbeam diagnostics. The role this technique can play within the wider MFE program towards future fusion reactors as an advanced diagnostic is explored. The nature and breadth of the measurements fulfills the mission of future diagnostics to maintain and optimize fusion reactor performance.

We demonstrate first experimental investigation on the performance of a single-node reservoir computer based on a silicon microring resonator (MRR) operating on the digit recognition task. The input layer of the reservoir is composed of a single laser, a Mach-Zehnder electro-optic modulator, which encodes intensity of the light applied to the MRR input. The input signal is transformed into a virtual high-dimensional space through thermal nonlinearity in the MRR. The MRR response is recorded with readout network consisting of a photodetector and an oscilloscope. To study the principle of operation we measure nonlinear frequency response as well as dynamic response of the MRR. The resonator demonstrates a negative shift of the resonance frequency with an increase in input power due to the dominating thermo-optic effect. In addition to the frequency shift, the MRR transmission coefficient grows at the red side of the resonance. This effect underlies the nonlinear transient dynamics at the MRR output and provides an intrinsic fading memory that are the basis for the implementation of a reservoir computer. Here a silicon MRR serves as a single nonlinear physical node. We give proof of concept demonstrations of the developed reservoir architecture by solving the classification task. The performance characteristics is evaluated with the short-term memory and the parity-check tests. Obtained results pave the way to chip-scale optical reservoirs computing.

Atomic data determined by analysis of observed atomic spectra are essential for plasma diagnostics. For each low-ionisation open d- and f-subshell atomic species, around $10^3$ fine structure level energies can be determined through years of analysis of $10^4$ observable spectral lines. We propose the automation of this task by casting the analysis procedure as a Markov decision process and solving it by graph reinforcement learning using reward functions learned on historical human decisions. In our evaluations on existing spectral line lists and theoretical calculations for Co II and Nd II-III, hundreds of level energies were computed within hours, agreeing with published values in 95% of cases for Co II and 54-87% for Nd II-III. As the current efficiency in atomic fine structure determination struggles to meet growing atomic data demands from astronomy and fusion science, our new artificial intelligence approach sets the stage for closing this gap.

Uniform 2D Target Generation via Inverse-designed Metasurfaces

Subjects:
Optics (physics.optics)
We propose an inverse design framework for metasurfaces that achieves highly uniform two-dimensional intensity profiles across an on-demand shape. The optimization objective is formulated to enhance overall projection efficiency via the adjoint method, while a regularization term penalizes local deviations in field amplitude to suppress intensity non-uniformity. The regularization weight is adaptively tuned based on the current non-uniformity, enabling stable and efficient optimization. Compared with the widely used mean squared error (MSE) objective, our method yields superior performance in both intensity fidelity and uniformity. We also extend our framework to handle realistic Gaussian beam illumination by biasing the library. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of our approach for generating high-quality, uniform field patterns.

The contact process is a simple infection spreading model showcasing an out-of-equilibrium phase transition between a macroscopically active and an inactive phase. Such absorbing state phase transitions are often sensitive to the presence of quenched disorder. Traditionally, a phase transition in the disordered contact process is either triggered by dilution or by locally varying the infection rate. However, when both factors play an important role, a multicritical point emerges that remains poorly understood. Here, we study the multicritical contact process by large-scale Monte Carlo simulations in two and three dimensions. The multicritical behavior is found to be universal and exhibits ultra-slow, activated dynamical scaling, with exponents consistent with those predicted by the strong disorder renormalization group method. This finding indicates that the multicritical contact process belongs to the same universality class as the multicritical quantum Ising model, opening future directions to measure quantum entanglement properties via classical simulations.

We investigate the impact of Hebbian learning on the contact process, a paradigmatic model for infection spreading, which has been also proposed as a simple model to capture the dynamics of inter-regional brain activity propagation as well as population spreading. Each of these contexts calls for an extension of the contact process with local learning. We introduce Hebbian learning as a positive or negative reinforcement of the activation rate between a pair of sites after each successful activation event. Learning can happen either in both directions motivated by social distancing (mutual learning model), or in only one of the directions motivated by brain and population dynamics (source or target learning models). Hebbian learning leads to a rich class of emergent behavior, where local incentives can lead to the opposite global effects. In general, positive reinforcement (increasing activation rates) leads to a loss of the active phase, while negative reinforcement (reducing activation rates) can turn the inactive phase into a globally active phase. In two dimensions and above, the effect of negative reinforcement is twofold: it promotes the spreading of activity, but at the same time gives rise to the appearance of effectively immune regions, entailing the emergence of two distinct critical points. Positive reinforcement can lead to Griffiths effects with non-universal power-law scaling, through the formation of random loops of activity, a manifestation of the ``ant mill" phenomenon.

Quantum radiation-pressure noise (QRPN) limits the low-frequency sensitivity of gravitational wave detectors. The established method for suppressing QRPN is the injection of frequency-dependent squeezed light. It requires long-baseline filter cavities introducing substantial experimental complexity. A completely different interferometer concept is the speedmeter. It avoids QRPN at the source by measuring test mass speed instead of position. While extensively researched theoretically, speedmeters are yet to be demonstrated with a moving test mass in an optomechanical setting. In this work, we present the first experimental observation of speedmeter behavior in a system with a movable test mass. We realize a novel hybrid readout cavity configuration that enables simultaneous extraction of position and speed signals from two distinct output ports. We compare the optical transfer functions associated with each channel and observe the expected scaling behavior that distinguishes a speedmeter from a position-meter. We support our observations with a detailed theoretical model, showing how the hybrid readout cavity implements key speedmeter features. Our results underscore the relevance of the speedmeter concept as an alternative for mitigating QRPN in future detectors and lay the groundwork for further experimental exploration.

The transport of cosmic rays through turbulent astrophysical plasmas still constitutes an open problem. Building on recent progress, we study the combined effect of magnetic mirroring and resonant curvature scattering on parallel and perpendicular transport. We conduct test particle simulations in snapshots of an anisotropic magnetohydrodynamics simulation, and record magnetic moment variation and field line curvature around pitch angle reversals. We find for strongly magnetized particles that (i) pitch angle reversals may occur either in coherent regions of the field with small variation of the magnetic moment via magnetic mirroring, or in chaotic regions of the field with strong variation of the magnetic moment via resonant curvature scattering; (ii) parallel transport can be modeled as a Lévy walk with a truncated power-law distribution based on pitch angle reversal times; and (iii) perpendicular transport is enhanced by resonant curvature scattering in synergy with chaotic field line separation, and diminished by magnetic mirroring due to confinement in locally ordered field line bundles. While magnetic mirroring constitutes the bulk of reversal events, resonant curvature scattering additionally acts on trajectories which fall in the loss cones of typical mirroring structures and thus provides the cut-off for the reversal time distribution. Our results, which highlight the role of the magnetic field line geometry in cosmic ray transport processes, are consistent with energy-independent diffusion coefficients. We conclude by considering how energy-dependent observations could arise from an intermittently inhomogeneous interstellar medium.

Random Matrix Theory-guided sparse PCA for single-cell RNA-seq data

Single-cell RNA-seq provides detailed molecular snapshots of individual cells but is notoriously noisy. Variability stems from biological differences, PCR amplification bias, limited sequencing depth, and low capture efficiency, making it challenging to adapt computational pipelines to heterogeneous datasets or evolving technologies. As a result, most studies still rely on principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, valued for its interpretability and robustness. Here, we improve upon PCA with a Random Matrix Theory (RMT)-based approach that guides the inference of sparse principal components using existing sparse PCA algorithms. We first introduce a novel biwhitening method, inspired by the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm, that simultaneously stabilizes variance across genes and cells. This enables the use of an RMT-based criterion to automatically select the sparsity level, rendering sparse PCA nearly parameter-free. Our mathematically grounded approach retains the interpretability of PCA while enabling robust, hands-off inference of sparse principal components. Across seven single-cell RNA-seq technologies and four sparse PCA algorithms, we show that this method systematically improves the reconstruction of the principal subspace and consistently outperforms PCA-, autoencoder-, and diffusion-based methods in cell-type classification tasks.

Subjects:
Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci); Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph)
A method is presented to calculate from first principles the higher-order elastic constants of a solid material. The method relies on finite strain deformations, a density functional theory approach to calculate the Cauchy stress tensor, and a recursive numerical differentiation technique homologous to the divided differences polynomial interpolation algorithm. The method is applicable as is to any material, regardless its symmetry, to calculate elastic constants of, in principle, any order. Here, we introduce conceptual framework and technical details of our method, we discuss sources of errors, we assess convergence trends, and we present selected applications. In particular, our method is used to calculate elastic constants up to the 6$^{th}$ order of two crystalline materials with the cubic symmetry, silicon and gold. To demonstrate general applicability, our method is also used to calculate the elastic constants up to the 5$^{th}$ order of $\alpha$-quartz, a crystalline material belonging to the trigonal crystal system, and the second- and third-order elastic constants of kevlar, a material with an anisotropic bonding network. Higher order elastic constants computed with our method are validated against density functional theory calculations by comparing stress responses to large deformations derived within the continuum approximation.

Implicit neural representations (INRs) have emerged as a compact and parametric alternative to discrete array-based data representations, encoding information directly in neural network weights to enable resolution-independent representation and memory efficiency. However, existing INR approaches, when constrained to compact network sizes, struggle to faithfully represent the multi-scale structures, high-frequency information, and fine textures that characterize the majority of scientific datasets. To address this limitation, we propose WIEN-INR, a wavelet-informed implicit neural representation that distributes modeling across different resolution scales and employs a specialized kernel network at the finest scale to recover subtle details. This multi-scale architecture allows for the use of smaller networks to retain the full spectrum of information while preserving the training efficiency and reducing storage cost. Through extensive experiments on diverse scientific datasets spanning different scales and structural complexities, WIEN-INR achieves superior reconstruction fidelity while maintaining a compact model size. These results demonstrate WIEN-INR as a practical neural representation framework for high-fidelity scientific data encoding, extending the applicability of INRs to domains where efficient preservation of fine detail is essential.

Signal Processing (eess.SP); Applied Physics (physics.app-ph)
Orbital angular momentum (OAM) technology has attracted much research interest in recent years because of its characteristic helical phase front twisting around the propagation axis and natural orthogonality among different OAM states to encode more degrees of freedom than classical planar beams. Leveraging upon these features, OAM technique has been applied to wireless communication systems to enhance spectral efficiency and radar systems to distinguish spatial targets without beam scanning. Leveraging upon these unique properties, we propose an OAM-based millimeter-wave joint radar-communications (JRC) system comprising a bi-static automotive radar and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications. Different from existing uniform circular array (UCA) based OAM systems where each element is an isotropic antenna, an OAM spatial modulation scheme utilizing a uniform linear array (ULA) is adopted with each element being a traveling-wave antenna, producing multiple Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) vortex beams simultaneously. Specifically, we first build a novel bi-static automotive OAM-JRC model that embeds communication messages in a radar signal, following which a target position and velocity parameters estimation algorithm is designed with only radar frames. Then, an OAM-based mode-division multiplexing (MDM) strategy between radar and JRC frames is presented to ensure the JRC parameters identifiability and recovery. Furthermore, we analyze the performance of the JRC system through deriving recovery guarantees and Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of radar target parameters and evaluating the bit error rate (BER) of communication, respectively. Our numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed OAM-based JRC system and parameter estimation method.

Photon Blockade Mediated by Two-Photon Absorption in an Optical Parametric Amplifier

Photon blockade (PB) is a quantum effect in strongly nonlinear systems where a single photon prevents the system from being excited to a higher level, generating anti-bunched light fields. It enables the generation of single-photon sources for quantum information processing. Conventional photon blockade (CPB) leverages strong nonlinear interactions to generate an anharmonic energy spectrum. Unconventional photon blockade (UPB) utilizes destructive quantum interference between excitation pathways. Recently, environmentally induced photon blockade (EPB) has emerged as a novel approach, exploiting two-photon absorption (TPA) to realize photon blockade. In this work, we combine UPB and EPB together, considering the TPA effect in the optical parametric amplifier (OPA), thereby achieving a more stable PB with stronger suppression of multi-photon states.

Cloud phase profiles are critical for numerical weather prediction (NWP), as they directly affect radiative transfer and precipitation processes. In this study, we present a benchmark dataset and a baseline framework for transforming multimodal satellite observations into detailed 3D cloud phase structures, aiming toward operational cloud phase profile retrieval and future integration with NWP systems to improve cloud microphysics parameterization. The multimodal observations consist of (1) high--spatiotemporal--resolution, multi-band visible (VIS) and thermal infrared (TIR) imagery from geostationary satellites, and (2) accurate vertical cloud phase profiles from spaceborne lidar (CALIOP\slash CALIPSO) and radar (CPR\slash CloudSat). The dataset consists of synchronized image--profile pairs across diverse cloud regimes, defining a supervised learning task: given VIS/TIR patches, predict the corresponding 3D cloud phase structure. We adopt SGMAGNet as the main model and compare it with several baseline architectures, including UNet variants and SegNet, all designed to capture multi-scale spatial patterns. Model performance is evaluated using standard classification metrics, including Precision, Recall, F1-score, and IoU. The results demonstrate that SGMAGNet achieves superior performance in cloud phase reconstruction, particularly in complex multi-layer and boundary transition regions. Quantitatively, SGMAGNet attains a Precision of 0.922, Recall of 0.858, F1-score of 0.763, and an IoU of 0.617, significantly outperforming all baselines across these key metrics.

We report ultra-wide bandgap (UWBG) AlGaN heterostructure field-effect transistors (HFETs) exhibiting a high breakdown field (> 5.3 MV/cm) and a low contact resistance (~1.55 {\Omega}mm), tailored for high-power radiofrequency applications. A split-doped barrier architecture, employing two distinct doping concentrations, is shown to enhance both the breakdown field and contact resistance. This design enables a state-of-the-art combination of maximum drain current (487 mA/mm) and breakdown field, along with a high cutoff frequency of 7.2 GHz. These results demonstrate a viable pathway to push device performance toward the material limits while minimizing contact resistance in UWBG AlGaN HFETs, paving the way for next-generation high-power, high-frequency applications.

Drawing inspiration from the concept of the "primitive path" of a linear chain in melt conditions, we introduce here a numerical protocol which allows us to detect, in an unambiguous manner, the "primitive shapes" of ring polymers in two-dimensional melts. Then, by analysing the conformational properties of these primitive shapes, we demonstrate that they conform to the statistics of two-dimensional branched polymers (or, trees) in the same melt conditions, in agreement with seminal theoretical work by Khokhlov, Nechaev and Rubinstein. Results for polymer dynamics in light of the branched nature of the rings are also presented and discussed.

Autonomous physical learning systems modify their internal parameters and solve computational tasks without relying on external computation. Compared to traditional computers, they enjoy distributed and energy-efficient learning due to their physical dynamics. In this paper, we introduce a self-learning resistor network, the Restricted Kirchhoff Machine, capable of solving unsupervised learning tasks akin to the Restricted Boltzmann Machine algorithm. The circuit relies on existing technology based on Contrastive Local Learning Networks, in which two identical networks compare different physical states to implement a contrastive local learning rule. We simulate the training of the machine on the binarized MNIST dataset, providing a proof of concept of its learning capabilities. Finally, we compare the scaling behavior of the time, power, and energy consumed per operation as more nodes are included in the machine to their Restricted Boltzmann Machine counterpart operated on CPU and GPU platforms.

We consider polaritons formed by hybridizing particle-hole excitations of an insulating phase with a cavity photon at sub-gap frequencies, where absorption is suppressed. The strength of the hybridization is driven by the Van Hove singularity in the JDOS at the band gap: the stronger the singularity, the more a photon is hybridized with the interband transitions. In order to increase the singularity and thus the polariton hybridization without absorption, we propose to engineer a non-parabolic momentum dispersion of the bands around the gap in order to implement a high-order Van Hove singularity (HOVHS) in the JDOS. Ultracold atoms in tunable optical lattices are an ideal platform to engineer two-dimensional gapped phases with non-trivial band dispersions at the gap. Moreover, the intrinsic non-interacting nature of polarized fermionic atoms prevents the emergence of sub-gap excitations, which are common in solid-state systems and could otherwise spoil the absence of absorption below the gap. Our findings identify band-engineering at the gap edge as a promising route for polariton control with applications in quantum-nonlinear optics.

Complete catalytic oxidation of methane is an effective strategy for greenhouse gas mitigation and clean energy conversion; yet, ensuring both high catalytic activity and stability with palladium-based catalysts remains a challenge. In the present work, we employed a theoretical investigation of methane oxidation over single-atom Pd supported on SSZ-13 zeolite using density functional theory calculations, combined with climbing-image nudged elastic band calculations to determine activation barriers. A systematic assessment of various Al distributions and Pd placements was carried out to identify the most stable configurations for Pd incorporation within the zeolite this http URL, two mechanistic routes for methane activation were evaluated: (i) direct dehydrogenation under dry conditions, and (ii) O$_2$-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation. Our results demonstrate that the direct (dry) pathway is energetically demanding and overall endothermic, whereas the O$_2$ assisted route facilitates the exothermic energy profile, particularly in the C-H bond cleavage. The formation of stable hydroxyl and CO/CO$_2$ intermediates were also studied. The results emphasize the role of oxygen-rich environments in enabling the complete methane oxidation with improved thermodynamic feasibility. Moreover, we propose an alternate low-energy pathway based on O-assisted and multi-site mechanisms that reduce the overall reaction enthalpy. These insights provide the design principles for highly active and moisture-resistant Pd-zeolite catalysts for sustainable methane utilization.

Suspensions of swimming bacteria interact hydrodynamically over long ranges, organizing themselves into collective states that drive large-scale chaotic flows, often referred to as "bacterial turbulence". Despite extensive experimental and theoretical work, it remains unclear whether an intrinsic length scale underlies the observed patterns. To shed light on the mechanism driving active turbulence, we investigate the emergence of large-scale flows in E. coli suspensions confined within cylindrical chambers, systematically varying confinement height over more than two orders of magnitude. We first demonstrate that the critical density for the onset of collective motion scales inversely with this confinement height without saturation, even for the smallest densities observed. Near the onset, both the observed length and time scales increase sharply, with the length scale bounded only by the vertical confinement. Importantly, both scales exhibit clear power-law dependence on the confinement height, demonstrating the absence of an intrinsic length scale in bacterial collective motion. This holds up to scales nearly 10,000 times the size of a single bacterium, as evidenced by transient coherent vortices spanning the full chamber width near the onset. Our experimental results demonstrating that bacterial turbulence is scale-free provide important constraints for theories aiming to capture the dynamics of wet active matter.

Using extensive numerical analysis of 20,000 randomly generated two-qubit states, we provide a quantitative analysis of the connection between entanglement measures and Maximized Quantum Fisher Information (MQFI). Our systematic study shows strong empirical relationships between the metrological capacity of quantum states and three different entanglement measures: concurrence, negativity, and relative entropy of entanglement. We show that optimization over local unitary transformations produces substantially more predictable relationships than fixed-generator quantum Fisher information approaches using sophisticated statistical analysis, such as bootstrap resampling, systematic data binning, and multiple model comparisons. With exponential fits reaching $R^2 > 0.99$ and polynomial models reaching $R^2 = 0.999$, we offer thorough empirical support for saturation behavior in quantum metrological advantage. With immediate applications to realworld quantum sensing protocols, our findings directly empirically validate important predictions from quantum resource theory and set fundamental bounds for quantum sensor optimization and resource allocation. These intricate relationships are quantitatively described by the polynomial and exponential fit equations, which offer crucial real-world direction for the design of quantum sensors.

Subjects:
Analysis of PDEs (math.AP); Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)
In the past, we have presented a systematic computational framework for analyzing self-similar and traveling wave dynamics in nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) by dynamically factoring out continuous symmetries such as translation and scaling. This is achieved through the use of time-dependent transformations -- what can be viewed as dynamic pinning conditions -- that render the symmetry-invariant solution stationary or slowly varying in rescaled coordinates. The transformation process yields a modified evolution equation coupled with algebraic constraints on the symmetry parameters, resulting in index-2 differential-algebraic equation (DAE) systems. The framework accommodates both first-kind and second-kind self-similarity, and directly recovers the self-similarity exponents or wave speeds as part of the solution, upon considering steady-state solutions in the rescaled coordinate frame. To solve the resulting high-index DAE systems, we employ Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), which naturally integrate PDE residuals and algebraic constraints into a unified loss function. This allows simultaneous inference of both the invariant solution and the transformation properties (such as the speed or the scaling rate without the need for large computational domains, mesh adaptivity, or front tracking. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method on four canonical problems: (i) the Nagumo equation exhibiting traveling waves, (ii) the diffusion equation (1D and 2D) with first-kind self-similarity, (iii) the 2D axisymmetric porous medium equation showcasing second-kind self-similarity, and (iv) the Burgers equation, which involves both translational and scaling invariance. The results demonstrate the capability of PINNs to effectively solve these complex PDE-DAE systems, providing a promising tool for studying nonlinear wave and scaling phenomena.

For light in a single temporal mode, the time dependence is associated entirely with the deterministic pulse shape rather than the quantum state. This means the second order coherence of light can no longer be understood as the temporal distribution of photons. We calculate the distribution of photon arrival time differences for pulsed light and find that it is inherently strongly bunched in terms of photocount arrival time differences. We further show how to account for the pulse shape when determining the second order coherence that characterizes quantum states.

The directional control of light in miniaturized plasmonic waveguides holds appealing possibilities for emerging nanophotonic technologies, but is hindered by the intrinsic reciprocal optical response of conventional plasmonic materials. While the ability of graphene to sustain large electrical currents shows promise for nonreciprocal plasmonics, studies have been limited to extended samples characterized by linear electrical dispersion. Here, we theoretically explore quantum finite-size and nonlocal effects in the nonreciprocal response of mesoscale plasmonic waveguides comprised of drift-biased graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Using atomistic simulation methods based on tight-binding electronic states and self-consistent mean-field optical response, we reveal that a moderate electrical bias can significantly break reciprocity for propagation of guided plasmon modes in GNRs and CNTs exhibiting electronic band gaps. The excitation by a nearby point dipole emitter and subsequent propagation of guided plasmon modes can thus be actively controlled by the applied current, which can further be leveraged to mediate nonlocal interactions of multiple emitters. Our results establish graphene nanostructures as a promising atomically thin platform for nonreciprocal nanophotonics.

Many questions must be answered before understanding the relationship between the emerging magnetic flux through the solar surface and the extreme geoeffective events. The main ingredients for getting X-ray class flares and large interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) are the build-up of electric current in the corona, the existence of magnetic free energy, magnetic energy/helicity ratio, twist, and magnetic stress in active regions (ARs). The upper limit of solar energy in the space research era, as well as the potential for experiencing superflares and extreme solar events, can be predicted using MHD simulations of CMEs.
To address this problem, we consider the recent events of May 2024 and use three MHD models: 1) OHM ("Observationally driven High order scheme Magnetohydrodynamic code") for investigating the magnetic evolutions at a synthetic dipole structure. 2) TMF (time-dependent magneto-friction) for setting up an initial non-potential magnetic field in the active region. A zero-beta MHD model for tracing the magnetic evolution of active regions. 3) EUHFORIA (''European heliospheric forecasting information asset'') for interplanetary CME propagations.
For the eruptive flares with CMEs, magnetic solar energy is computed along with data-constrained MHD simulations for the May 2024 events. We show the consistency between the data-initiated realistic simulation of the May 2024 big event and energy scalings from an idealised simulation of a bipolar eruption using OHM. The estimated free magnetic energy did not surpass $5.2 \times 10^{32}\;$erg. Good arrival time predictions ($<3$ hours) are achieved with the EUHFORIA simulation with the cone model. We note the interest in coupling all the chains of codes from the Sun to the Earth and developing different approaches to test the results.

Confinement of particles into bound states is a phenomenon spanning from high-energy to condensed matter physics, which can be studied in the framework of lattice gauge theories (LGTs). Achieving a comprehensive understanding of confinement continues to pose a major challenge, in particular at finite matter density and in the presence of strong quantum fluctuations. State-of-the-art quantum simulators constitute a promising platform to address this problem. Here we study confinement in coupled chains of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGTs coupled to matter fields, that can be mapped to a mixed-dimensional (mixD) XXZ model. We perform large-scale numerical matrix-product state calculations to obtain the phase diagram of this model, in which we uncover striped phases formed by the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ charges that can be melted at finite temperature or by increasing the tunneling rate. To explore this setting experimentally, we use our quantum simulator constituted by erbium atoms with dipolar interactions in a quantum gas microscope, and observe the predicted melting of a stripe phase by increasing the particle tunneling rate. Our explorative experimental studies of thermal deconfinement of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ charges motivate our further theoretical study of the mixD $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT, in which we predict a confined meson gas at finite temperature and low magnetization where thermal fluctuations destroy stripes but enable spontaneous commensurate spin order. Overall, we demonstrate that our platform can be used to study confinement in $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGTs coupled to matter fields, including long-range interactions and beyond one dimension, paving the way for future research of confinement in the quantum many-body regime.

Snakes can move through almost any terrain. Similarly, snake robots hold the promise as a versatile platform to traverse complex environments like earthquake rubble. Unlike snake locomotion on flat surfaces which is inherently stable, when snakes traverse complex terrain by deforming their body out of plane, it becomes challenging to maintain stability. Here, we review our recent progress in understanding how snakes and snake robots traverse large, smooth obstacles that lack anchor points for gripping or bracing. First, we discovered that the generalist variable kingsnake combines lateral oscillation and cantilevering. Regardless of step height and surface friction, the overall gait is preserved. Next, to quantify static stability of the snake, we developed a method to interpolate continuous body in three dimensions (both position and orientation) between discrete tracked markers. By analyzing the base of support using the interpolated continuous body 3-D kinematics, we discovered that the snake maintained perfect stability during traversal, even on the most challenging low friction, high step. Finally, we applied this gait to a snake robot and systematically tested its performance traversing large steps with variable heights to further understand stability principles. The robot rapidly and stably traversed steps nearly as high as a third of its body length. As step height increased, the robot rolled more frequently to the extent of flipping over, reducing traversal probability. The absence of such failure in the snake with a compliant body inspired us to add body compliance to the robot. With better surface contact, the compliant body robot suffered less roll instability and traversed high steps at higher probability, without sacrificing traversal speed. Our robot traversed large step-like obstacles more rapidly than most previous snake robots, approaching that of the animal.

Effective locomotion in nature happens by transitioning across multiple modes (e.g., walk, run, climb). Despite this, far more mechanistic understanding of terrestrial locomotion has been on how to generate and stabilize around near-steady-state movement in a single mode. We still know little about how locomotor transitions emerge from physical interaction with complex terrain. Consequently, robots largely rely on geometric maps to avoid obstacles, not traverse them. Recent studies revealed that locomotor transitions in complex 3-D terrain occur probabilistically via multiple pathways. Here, we show that an energy landscape approach elucidates the underlying physical principles. We discovered that locomotor transitions of animals and robots self-propelled through complex 3-D terrain correspond to barrier-crossing transitions on a potential energy landscape. Locomotor modes are attracted to landscape basins separated by potential energy barriers. Kinetic energy fluctuation from oscillatory self-propulsion helps the system stochastically escape from one basin and reach another to make transitions. Escape is more likely towards lower barrier direction. These principles are surprisingly similar to those of near-equilibrium, microscopic systems. Analogous to free energy landscapes for multi-pathway protein folding transitions, our energy landscape approach from first principles is the beginning of a statistical physics theory of multi-pathway locomotor transitions in complex terrain. This will not only help understand how the organization of animal behavior emerges from multi-scale interactions between their neural and mechanical systems and the physical environment, but also guide robot design, control, and planning over the large, intractable locomotor-terrain parameter space to generate robust locomotor transitions through the real world.

Animals and robots must right themselves after flipping over on the ground. The discoid cockroach pushes its wings against the ground in an attempt to dynamically self-right by a somersault. However, because this maneuver is strenuous, the animal often fails to overcome the potential energy barrier and makes continual attempts. In this process, the animal flails its legs, whose lateral perturbation eventually leads it to roll to the side to self-right. Our previous work developed a cockroach-inspired robot capable of leg-assisted, winged self-righting, and a robot simulation study revealed that the outcome of this strategy depends sensitively on wing-leg coordination (measured by the phase between their motions). Here, we further elucidate why this is the case by developing a template to model the complex hybrid dynamics resulting from discontinuous contact and actuation. We used the template to calculate the potential energy barrier that the body must overcome to self-right, mechanical energy contribution by wing pushing and leg flailing, and mechanical energy dissipation due to wing-ground collision. The template revealed that wing-leg coordination (phase) strongly affects self-righting outcome by changing mechanical energy budget. Well-coordinated appendage motions (good phase) accumulate more mechanical energy than poorly-coordinated motions (bad phase), thereby better overcoming the potential energy barrier to self-right more successfully. Finally, we demonstrated practical use of the template for predicting a new control strategy to further increase self-righting performance and informing robot design.

Complex systems span multiple spatial and temporal scales, making their dynamics challenging to understand and predict. This challenge is especially daunting when one wants to study localized and/or rare events. Advances in dynamical systems theory, including the development of state-dependent dynamical indices, namely local dimension and persistence, have provided powerful tools for studying these phenomena. However, existing applications of such indices rely on a predefined and fixed spatial domain, that provides a single scalar quantity for the entire region of interest. This aspect prevents understanding the spatially localized dynamical behavior of the system. In this work, we introduce Spatio-temporal Dynamical Indices (SDIs), that leverage the existing framework of state-dependent local dimension and persistence. SDIs are obtained via a sliding window approach, enabling the exploration of space-dependent properties in spatio-temporal data. As an example, we show that, through this framework, we are able to reconcile previously different perspectives on European summertime heatwaves. This result showcases the importance of accounting for spatial scales when performing scale-dependent dynamical analyses.

Non-Hermitian photonics has attracted significant interest and influences several key areas such as optical metamaterials, laser physics, and nonlinear optics. While non-Hermitian effects have been widely addressed in two-dimensional systems, we focus on realistic three-dimensional devices. To this end we generalize established phase space methods from mesoscopic optics and introduce Husimi functions for three-dimensional systems that deepen the insight and access to the mode morphology and their dynamics. We illustrate that four-dimensional Husimi functions can be represented using a specific projection in two dimensions and illustrate it for (conical) cylindrical cavities. The non-Hermitian character of the intrinsically open photonic systems is in particular revealed when examining the TE and TM polarization character of the resonance modes. Unlike the 2D case, polarization is not conserved in three-dimensional cavities, and we use generalized Husimi function to represent the interaction of polarization modes. We find their dynamics to be ruled by a network of exceptional points in the parameter space spanned by the refractive index and the cavity geometry tilt angle. This approach not only enhances our understanding of cavity modes but also aids in the design of more efficient photonic devices and systems.

Prior-Adapted Progressive Time-Resolved CBCT Reconstruction Using a Dynamic Reconstruction and Motion Estimation Method

Medical Physics (physics.med-ph)
Cone-beam CT (CBCT) provides on-board volumetric anatomy for image guidance and treatment adaptation in radiotherapy. To compensate for respiration-induced anatomical motion, time-resolved CBCT is highly desired to capture the spatiotemporal anatomical variations but faces challenges in accuracy and efficiency due to substantial optimization needed in image reconstruction and motion modeling. We proposed a fast time-resolved CBCT reconstruction framework, based on a dynamic reconstruction and motion estimation method with new reconstructions initialized and conditioned on prior reconstructions in an adaptive fashion (DREME-adapt). DREME-adapt reconstructs a time-resolved CBCT sequence from a fractional standard CBCT scan while simultaneously generating a machine learning-based motion model that allows single-projection-driven intra-treatment CBCT estimation and motion tracking. Via DREME-adapt, a virtual fraction is generated from a pre-treatment 4D-CT set of each patient for a clean, 'cold-start' reconstruction. For subsequent fractions of the same patient, DREME-adapt uses pre-derived motion models and reference CBCTs as initializations to drive a 'warm-start' reconstruction, based on a lower-cost refining strategy. Three strategies: DREME-cs which drops the 'warm-start' component, DREME-adapt-vfx which uses a fixed initialization (virtual fraction's reconstruction results), and DREME-adapt-pro which initialize reconstructions through a progressive daisy chain scheme (virtual fraction for fraction 1, fraction 1 for fraction 2, and so on), were evaluated on a digital phantom study and a patient study. DREME-adapt allows fast and accurate time-resolved CBCT reconstruction and enhances the clinical adoption potential of the DREME framework.

All-dielectric metasurface polarization scrambler for imaging applications

Subjects:
Optics (physics.optics)
Polarization scramblers are essential for many imaging applications involving polarization sensitive instruments and partially polarized fluxes. In such cases, the light must be depolarized to allow properly calibrated measurements. Several types of depolarizers are already in use, but none is optimal due to the inevitable image degradation associated with the scrambling process. Here, we present a device based on an all-dielectric metasurface using anisotropic scatterers capable of generating multiple polarization states by varying their orientation angle. Our new scrambling solution allows a massive reduction in the integrated degree of polarization and thus the spatial depolarization of any incident linear polarization, while allowing easier integration into the instrument design and reducing the impact on its image quality.

A critical element in the realization of large liquid and gas time projection chambers (TPCs) is the delivery and distribution of high voltages into and around the detector. Such experiments require of order tens of kilovolts to enable electron drift over meter-scale distances. This paper describes the design and operation of the cathode feedthrough and high voltage distribution through the field cage of the NEXT-100 experiment, an underground TPC that will search for neutrinoless double beta decay $0\nu\beta\beta$. The feedthrough has been demonstrated to hold pressures up to 20~bar and sustain voltages as high as -65~kV, and the TPC is operating stably at its design high voltages. The system has been realized within the constraints of a stringent radiopurity budget and is now being used to execute a suite of sensitive double beta decay analyses.

Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph)
This paper gives a pedestrian presentation of some technical results recently published in mathematical physics with non-trivial implications for laser-plasma interaction. The aim is to get across the main results without going into the details of the calculations, nor offering a specialist's user guide, but by focusing conceptually on how these results modify the commonly-held description -- in terms of laser hot spot fields -- of backscattering instabilities with a spatially smoothed laser beam. The intended readers are plasma physicists as well as graduate students interested in laser-plasma interaction. No prior knowledge of scattering instabilities is required. Step by step, we explain how the laser hot spots are gradually replaced with other structures, called instantons, as the amplification of the scattered light increases. In the amplification range of interest for laser-plasma interaction, instanton--hot spot complexes tend to appear in the laser field (in addition to the expected hot spots), with a non-negligible probability. For even larger amplifications and systems longer than a hot spot length, the hot spot field description is clearly invalidated by the instanton takeover.

Near-field-free super-potential FFT method for the three-dimensional free-space Poisson equation

Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph); Numerical Analysis (math.NA)
We present a spectrally accurate, efficient FFT-based method for the three-dimensional free-space Poisson equation with smooth, compactly supported sources. The method adopts a super-potential formulation: we first compute the convolution with the biharmonic Green's function, then recover the potential by spectral differentiation, applying the Laplacian in Fourier space. A separable Gaussian-sum (GS) approximation enables efficient precomputation and quasi-linear, FFT-based convolution. Owing to the biharmonic kernel's improved regularity, the GS cutoff error is fourth-order, uniform for all target points, eliminating the near-field corrections and Taylor expansions required in standard GS/Ewald-type methods. Benchmarks on Gaussian, oscillatory, and compactly supported densities reach the double-precision limit and, at matched accuracy on the same hardware, reduce both error and per-solve runtime relative to our original GS-based scheme. The resulting method is simple, reproducible, and efficient for three-dimensional free-space Poisson problems with smooth sources on uniform grids.

Minibeam and microbeam radiation therapy promise improved treatment outcomes through reduced normal tissue toxicity at better tumor control rates. The lack of suitable compact radiation sources limits the clinical application of minibeams to superficial tumors and renders it impossible for microbeams. We developed the first prototype of a compact line-focus X-ray tube (LFXT) with technology potentially suitable for clinical translation of minibeams and microbeams. We give an overview of the commissioning process preceding first operation, present optical and radiological focal spot characterization methods, and dosimetric measurements. Additionally, we report on first preclinical in vitro cell and in vivo mouse brain irradiations conducted with the LFXT prototype. The LFXT was high voltage conditioned up to 300 this http URL focal spot characterization resulted in a strongly eccentric electron distribution with a width of 72.3 $\mu$m. Dosimetry showed sharp microbeam dose profiles with steep lateral penumbras and a peak-to-valley dose ratio above 10 throughout a 70 mm thick PMMA phantom. An open-field dose rate of 4.3 Gy/s was measured at an acceleration voltage of 150 kV and a beam current of 17.4 mA at 150 mm distance from the focal spot. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated the feasibility of the LFXT for minibeam and microbeam applications with field sizes of 1.5-2 cm. The mice displayed no observable side effects after whole-brain 260 $\mu$m-minibeam irradiation. We successfully constructed and commissioned the first proof-of-concept LFXT prototype. Dosimetric characterizations of the achieved microbeam field showed the superiority of the LFXT compared to conventional X-ray tubes in terms of beam quality. In future developments, the remaining limitations of the prototype will be addressed for improved minibeam and first ever microbeam radiation therapy in a clinical setting.

Single-Trajectory Bayesian Modeling Reveals Multi-State Diffusion of the MSH Sliding Clamp

DNA mismatch repair (MMR) is the essential mechanism for preserving genomic integrity in various living organisms. In this process, MutS homologs (MSH) play crucial roles in identifying mismatched basepairs and recruiting downstream MMR proteins. The MSH protein exhibits distinct functions and diffusion dynamics before and after the recognition of mismatches while traversing along DNA. An ADP-bound MSH, known as the MSH searching clamp, scans DNA sequences via rotational diffusion along the DNA backbone. Upon recognizing a mismatch, the MSH combines with ATP molecules, forming a stable sliding clamp. Recent experimental evidence challenges the conventional view that the sliding clamp performs a simple Brownian motion. In this study, we explore the diffusion dynamics of the ATP-bound MSH sliding clamp through single-particle tracking experiments and introduce a Bayesian single-trajectory modeling framework to analyze its motion. Our quantitative analysis reveals that the diffusion characteristics defy explanation by a single-state diffusion mechanism. Instead, our in-depth model inference uncovers three distinct diffusion states, each characterized by specific diffusion coefficients. These states alternate over time, with cross-state transitions predominantly involving one intermediate state, and direct transitions between the slowest and the fastest states being scarce. We propose that these multi-state dynamics reflect underlying conformational changes in the MSH sliding clamp, highlighting a more intricate diffusion mechanism than previously appreciated.

The Compression and Reconnection Investigations of the Magnetopause (CRIMP) mission is a Heliophysics Medium-Class Explorer (MIDEX) Announcement of Opportunity (AO) mission concept designed to study mesoscale structures and particle outflow along Earth's magnetopause using two identical spacecraft. CRIMP would uncover the impact of magnetosheath mesoscale drivers, dayside magnetopause mesoscale phenomenological processes and structures, and localized plasma outflows on magnetic reconnection and the energy transfer process in the dayside magnetosphere. CRIMP accomplishes this through uniquely phased spacecraft configurations that allow multipoint, contemporaneous measurements at the magnetopause. This enables an unparalleled look at mesoscale spatial differences along the dayside magnetopause on the scale of 1-3 Earth Radii (Re). Through these measurements, CRMIP will uncover how local mass density enhancements affect global reconnection, how mesoscale structures drive magnetopause dynamics, and if the magnetopause acts as a perfectly absorbing boundary for radiation belt electrons. This allows CRIMP to determine the spatial scale, extent, and temporal evolution of energy and mass transfer processes at the magnetopause - crucial measurements to determine how the solar wind energy input in the magnetosphere is transmitted between regions and across scales. This concept was conceived as a part of the 2024 NASA Heliophysics Mission Design School.

Electromagnetic Flow Control in Hypersonic Rarefied Environment

Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph); Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)
The Unified Gas-Kinetic Wave-Particle (UGKWP) method, developed for multiscale simulation of partially ionized plasmas, has been extended to unstructured meshes, enabling the modeling of electromagnetic flows around a hemisphere across near-continuum to rarefied regimes. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first application of a multiscale plasma solver to this problem. In our approach, neutrals, ions, and electrons are treated as distinct species, with electrons modeled beyond the conventional fluid approximation. The numerical implementation is validated through comparison with reference solutions for neutral hypersonic flow around a sphere, as well as benchmarking against experimental data for a Mach 4.75 pre-ionized argon flow. In both cases, the UGKWP results show good agreement with the reference and experimental data. The findings reveal that rarefied effects play a significant role in the prediction of electromagnetic flow control, underscoring the necessity of multiscale modeling in plasma flow applications.

This study investigates the relationship between low-frequency shock-wave oscillations and buffet cells on the main wing of the NASA common research model. The flow conditions were set at a Mach number of 0.85, Reynolds number of 2.27 $\times$ 10$^6$, and angle of attack of 4.82$^{\circ}$. Buffet cells are cellular patterns with spanwise periodicity that propagate toward the wing tip, with nondimensional frequencies (Strouhal numbers) of 0.2--0.6, higher than those of shock oscillations associated with transonic buffet. However, the physical mechanisms driving buffet cells and their interaction with low-frequency shock motion are not fully understood. This study employs variational mode decomposition-based nonstationary coherent structure (VMD-NCS) analysis applied to unsteady pressure-sensitive paint measurement data. The results reveal that the amplitude of buffet cells is not directly coupled to the low-frequency shock-wave oscillations but instead shows correlation with the boundary layer separation state. Strong buffet cell fluctuations persist in regions of sustained separation (midspan), while their amplitude varies with local separation/reattachment dynamics in regions of intermittent separation (outboard). These observations suggest that shock-waves are important to generate the adverse pressure gradient necessary for boundary layer separation, but their influence on buffet cells depends on the resulting separation behavior. This insight from experimental observations in this study is consistent with previous computational studies suggesting that buffet cell behavior depends on boundary layer separation characteristics. Moreover, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of VMD-NCS analysis for investigating nonstationary fluid phenomena with multiple spatial and temporal patterns.

Inter-channel mis-synchronisation can be a limiting factor to the time resolution of high performance timing detectors with multiple readout channels and independent electronics units. In these systems, time calibration methods employed must be able to efficiently correct for minimal mis-synchronisation between channels and achieve the best detector performance. We present an iterative time calibration method based on Markov Chains, suitable for detector systems with multiple readout channels. Starting from correlated hit pairs alone, and without requiring an external reference time measurement, the method solves for fixed per-channel offsets, with precision limited only by the intrinsic single-channel resolution. A mathematical proof that the method is able to find the correct time offsets to be assigned to each detector channel in order to achieve inter-channel synchronisation is given, and it is shown that the number of iterations to reach convergence within the desired precision is controllable with a single parameter. Numerical studies are used to confirm unbiased recovery of true offsets. Finally, the application of the calibration method to the Super Fine-Grained Detector (SuperFGD) and the Time of Flight (TOF) detector at the upgraded T2K near detector (ND280) shows good improvement in overall timing resolution, demonstrating the effectiveness in a real-world scenario and scalability.

Topological Regularization of 1 Loop and 2 Loop Gravitational Corrections in the Higgs Fermion Sector
Sebastián Alí Sacasa-Céspedes
Subjects:
General Physics (physics.gen-ph)
Quantum gravity corrections to the behavior of matter, such as Higgs bosons and fermions, are notoriously difficult to calculate. The standard tools of quantum field theory often break down, producing infinite results that spoil our predictions. This work introduces a new geometric method, called Topological Regularization (TR), to solve this problem. The key idea is to temporarily "wrap" flat spacetime into a compact, curved shape (specifically, a four-dimensional sphere). This curvature naturally introduces a high-energy cutoff that prevents infinities without violating fundamental symmetries like Lorentz invariance. We apply this method to calculate one- and two-loop quantum gravity corrections to processes involving fermions and the Higgs boson. The results are not only finite but are directly governed by a single number describing the shape of the spacetime: its Euler characteristic. This reveals a profound link between the ultraviolet (UV) behavior of high energies and the infrared (IR) interactions of low energies. Furthermore, the mathematical form of our regulator suggests a thermal interpretation, drawing a fascinating connection to the heat felt by an accelerating observer (the Unruh effect). While the predicted effects are incredibly small and currently beyond experimental reach, this framework provides a symmetry-preserving, geometric path to exploring physics at the Planck scale.

Bubbles at the air-liquid interface are important for many natural and industrial processes. Factors influencing the lifetime of such surface bubbles have been investigated extensively, yet the impact of dissolved gas concentration remains unexplored. Here we investigate how the lifetime of surface bubbles in volatile liquids depends on the dissolved gas concentration. The bubble lifetime is found to decrease with the dissolved gas concentration. Larger microbubbles at increased gas concentration are found to trigger bubble bursting at earlier times. Combined with the thinning rate of the bubble cap thickness, a scaling law of the bubble lifetime is developed. Our findings may provide new insight on bubble and foam stability.

Phase retrieval in inline holography is a fundamental yet ill-posed inverse problem due to the nonlinear coupling between amplitude and phase in coherent imaging. We present a novel off-the-shelf solution that leverages a diffusion model trained solely on object amplitude to recover both amplitude and phase from diffraction intensities. Using a predictor-corrector sampling framework with separate likelihood gradients for amplitude and phase, our method enables complex field reconstruction without requiring ground-truth phase data for training. We validate the proposed approach through extensive simulations and experiments, demonstrating robust generalization across diverse object shapes, imaging system configurations, and modalities, including lensless setups. Notably, a diffusion prior trained on simple amplitude data (e.g., polystyrene beads) successfully reconstructs complex biological tissue structures, highlighting the method's adaptability. This framework provides a cost-effective, generalizable solution for nonlinear inverse problems in computational imaging, and establishes a foundation for broader coherent imaging applications beyond holography.

Online Dose Verification in VHEE Radiotherapy Using Bremsstrahlung Radiation

Subjects:
Medical Physics (physics.med-ph)
Very high energy electrons (VHEE) in the 50-250 MeV range, delivered in short pulses at ultra-high dose rates, are proposed for clinical FLASH radiotherapy (RT) targeting deep-seated tumors. The clinical implementation of VHEE-FLASH RT requires online verification to optimize dose delivery. In this study we propose a novel online dose verification technique based on the detection of bremsstrahlung photons during VHEE interactions with matter. A polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) phantom was simulated to evaluate the dose deposited by a VHEE beam and to optimise the system design to detect the bremsstralung radiation. Experimental validation was performed at the Beam Test Facility at Laboratori Nazionali di Frascati (Isituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare-INFN). A deep learning pipeline was developed to reconstruct the dose distribution in the phantom based on the bremsstrahlung radiation profile. Experimental results demonstrated successful detection of bremsstrahlung radiation emitted orthogonally to the beam axis. The deep learning model achieved accurate dose reconstruction based on the bremsstrahlung radiation profile with a discrepancy of less than 2 percent compared to the simulated dose distribution. This study confirms that bremsstrahlung detection provides a viable online verification for VHEE RT.

Complex time-varying networks are prominent models for a wide variety of spatiotemporal phenomena. The functioning of networks depends crucially on their connectivity, yet reliable techniques for determining communities in spacetime networks remain elusive. We adapt successful spectral techniques from continuous-time dynamics on manifolds to the graph setting to fill this gap. We formulate an inflated dynamic Laplacian for graphs and develop a spectral theory to underpin the corresponding algorithmic realisations. We develop spectral clustering approaches for both multiplex and non-multiplex networks, based on the eigenvectors of the inflated dynamic Laplacian and specialised Sparse EigenBasis Approximation (SEBA) post-processing of these eigenvectors. We demonstrate that our approach can outperform the Leiden algorithm applied both in spacetime and layer-by-layer, and we analyse voting data from the US senate (where senators come and go as congresses evolve) to quantify increasing polarisation in time.

Metal-halide perovskites (MHPs) have exciting optoelectronic properties and are under investigation for various applications, such as photovoltaics, light-emitting diodes, and lasers. An essential step towards exploiting the full potential of this class of materials is their large-scale, on-chip integration with high-resolution, top-down patterning. The development of such patterning methods for perovskite films is challenging because of their intrinsic ionic nature and adverse reactions with the solvents used in standard lithography processes. Here, we introduce a versatile and precise method comprising photolithography and reactive ion etching (RIE) processes that can be tuned to accommodate different perovskite compositions and morphologies. Our method utilizes conventional photoresists at reduced temperatures to create micron-sized features down to 1 ${\mu}$m, providing high reproducibility from chip to chip. The patterning technique is validated through atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), optical spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It enables the scalable and high-throughput on-chip monolithic integration of MHPs.

We introduce a novel framework for decomposing interventional causal effects into synergistic, redundant, and unique components, building on the intuition of Partial Information Decomposition (PID) and the principle of Möbius inversion. While recent work has explored a similar decomposition of an observational measure, we argue that a proper causal decomposition must be interventional in nature. We develop a mathematical approach that systematically quantifies how causal power is distributed among variables in a system, using a recently derived closed-form expression for the Möbius function of the redundancy lattice. The formalism is then illustrated by decomposing the causal power in logic gates, cellular automata, chemical reaction networks, and a transformer language model. Our results reveal how the distribution of causal power can be context- and parameter-dependent. The decomposition provides new insights into complex systems by revealing how causal influences are shared and combined among multiple variables, with potential applications ranging from attribution of responsibility in legal or AI systems, to the analysis of biological networks or climate models.

Multi-task learning through composite loss functions is fundamental to modern deep learning, yet optimizing competing objectives remains challenging. We present new theoretical and practical approaches for addressing directional conflicts between loss terms, demonstrating their effectiveness in physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) where such conflicts are particularly challenging to resolve. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate how these conflicts limit first-order methods and show that second-order optimization naturally resolves them through implicit gradient alignment. We prove that SOAP, a recently proposed quasi-Newton method, efficiently approximates the Hessian preconditioner, enabling breakthrough performance in PINNs: state-of-the-art results on 10 challenging PDE benchmarks, including the first successful application to turbulent flows with Reynolds numbers up to 10,000, with 2-10x accuracy improvements over existing methods. We also introduce a novel gradient alignment score that generalizes cosine similarity to multiple gradients, providing a practical tool for analyzing optimization dynamics. Our findings establish frameworks for understanding and resolving gradient conflicts, with broad implications for optimization beyond scientific computing.

Global quantum sensing enables parameter estimation across arbitrary ranges with a finite number of measurements. Among the various existing formulations, the Bayesian paradigm stands as a flexible approach for optimal protocol design under minimal assumptions. Within this paradigm, however, there are two fundamentally different ways to capture prior ignorance and uninformed estimation; namely, requiring invariance of the prior distribution under specific parameter transformations, or adhering to the geometry of a state space. In this paper we carefully examine the practical consequences of both the invariance-based and the geometry-based approaches, and show how to apply them in relevant examples of rate and coherence estimation in noisy settings. We find that, while the invariance-based approach often leads to simpler priors and estimators and is more broadly applicable in adaptive scenarios, the geometry-based one can lead to faster posterior convergence in a well-defined measurement setting. Crucially, by employing the notion of location-isomorphic parameters, we are able to unify the two formulations into a single practical and versatile framework for optimal global quantum sensing, detailing when and how each set of assumptions should be employed to tackle any given estimation task. We thus provide a blueprint for the design of novel high-precision quantum sensors.

Non-hermitian Green's function theory with $N$-body interactions: the coupled-cluster similarity transformation

We present the diagrammatic theory of the irreducible self-energy and Bethe-Salpeter kernel that naturally arises within the Green's function formalism for a general $N$-body non-hermitian interaction. In this work, we focus specifically on the coupled-cluster self-energy generated by the similarity transformation of the electronic structure Hamiltonian. We develop the biorthogonal quantum theory to construct dynamical correlation functions where the time-dependence of operators is governed by a non-hermitian Hamiltonian. We extend the Gell-Mann and Low theorem to include non-hermitian interactions and to generate perturbative expansions of many-body Green's functions. We introduce the single-particle coupled-cluster Green's function and derive the perturbative diagrammatic expansion for the non-hermitian coupled-cluster self-energy in terms of the `non-interacting' reference Green's function, $\tilde{\Sigma}[G_0]$. From the equation-of-motion of the single-particle coupled-cluster Green's function, we derive the self-consistent renormalized coupled-cluster self-energy, $\tilde{\Sigma}[\tilde{G}]$, and demonstrate its relationship to the perturbative expansion of the self-energy, $\tilde{\Sigma}[G_0]$. Subsequently, we show that the usual electronic self-energy can be recovered from the coupled-cluster self-energy by neglecting the effects of the similarity transformation. We show how the coupled-cluster ground state energy is related to the coupled-cluster self-energy and provide an overview of the relationship between approximations for the coupled-cluster self-energy, IP/EA-EOM-CCSD and the $G_0W_0$ approximation. As a result, we introduce the CC-$G_0W_0$ self-energy by leveraging the connections between Green's function and coupled-cluster theory. Finally, we derive the diagrammatic expansion of the coupled-cluster Bethe-Salpeter kernel.

Wave-particle duality in the measurement of gravitational radiation

In a consistent description of the quantum measurement process, whether the wave or particle-like aspect of a system is revealed depends on the details of the measurement chain, and cannot be interpreted as an objective fact about the system independent of the measurement. We show precisely how this comes to be in the measurement of gravitational radiation. Whether a wave or particle-like aspect is revealed is a property of the detector employed at the end of the quantum measurement chain, rather than of the meter, such as a gravitational-wave (GW) antenna or resonant bar, used to couple the radiation to the detector. A linear detector yields no signal for radiation in a Fock state and a signal proportional to the amplitude in a coherent state -- supporting a wave-like interpretation. By contrast, the signal from a detector coupled to the meter's energy is non-zero only when the incident radiation contains at least a single graviton. Thus, conceptually simple modifications of contemporary GW antennae can reveal wave-particle duality in the measurement of gravitational radiation.

Hopf Bifurcation of Nonlinear Non-Hermitian Skin Effect

The non-Hermitian skin effect, nonreciprocity-induced anomalous localization of an extensive number of eigenstates, represents a hallmark of non-Hermitian topological systems with no analogs in Hermitian systems. Despite its significance across various open classical and quantum systems, the influence of nonlinearity has remained largely unclear. Here, we reveal the Hopf bifurcation of the nonlinear skin effect as a critical phenomenon unique to nonlinear non-Hermitian systems. We demonstrate that nonlinearity destabilizes skin states and instead gives rise to the emergence of delocalized states associated with limit cycles in phase space. We also uncover the algebraically localized critical skin effect precisely at the Hopf bifurcation point. We illustrate these behavior in a nonlinear extension of the Hatano-Nelson model in both continuum and lattice. Our work shows a significant role of nonlinearity in the skin effect and uncovers rich phenomena arising from the interplay between non-Hermiticity and nonlinearity.

Context parroting: A simple but tough-to-beat baseline for foundation models in scientific machine learning

Recent time-series foundation models exhibit strong abilities to predict physical systems. These abilities include zero-shot forecasting, in which a model forecasts future states of a system given only a short trajectory as context, without knowledge of the underlying physics. Here, we show that foundation models often forecast through a simple parroting strategy, and when they are not parroting they exhibit some shared failure modes such as converging to the mean. As a result, a naive context parroting model that copies directly from the context scores higher than leading time-series foundation models on predicting a diverse range of dynamical systems, including low-dimensional chaos, turbulence, coupled oscillators, and electrocardiograms -- and at a tiny fraction of the computational cost. We draw a parallel between context parroting and induction heads, which explains recent works showing that large language models can often be repurposed for time series forecasting. Our dynamical systems perspective also ties the scaling between forecast accuracy and context length to the fractal dimension of the underlying chaotic attractor, providing insight into previously observed in-context neural scaling laws. By revealing the performance gaps and failure modes of current time-series foundation models, context parroting can guide the design of future foundation models and help identify in-context learning strategies beyond parroting.
